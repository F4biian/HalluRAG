        "llm_response": "Based on the given passages, here's how to change a bulb in a commercial landscape light:\n\n1. Choose the right bulb: Depending on the type of bulb and its wattage, expect to pay between $20 to nearly $100 per bulb. LED lights are more expensive but worth it due to their longer lifespan (30,000 to 50,000 hours).\n2. Take precautions when changing halogen bulbs: Halogen bulbs can burn out faster if touched with bare hands, as the oils from your skin can transfer to the bulb and cause a thin spot in the glass, leading to premature burning.\n\nTo change the bulb in a commercial landscape light, follow these steps:\n\na. Turn off the power to the light fixture at the electrical panel or breaker box. Ensure the light fixture is completely dark before attempting to change the bulb.\n\nb. Use a ladder or step stool to access the light fixture. Be cautious when climbing to avoid accidents or injury.\n\nc. Remove any protective cover or guard around the bulb to access it. Gently grasp the old bulb and twist it counterclockwise until it releases from the socket.\n\nd. Carefully remove the old bulb and discard it. Inspect the socket for any debris or dirt that may have accumulated.\n\ne. Insert the new bulb into the socket, making sure it is seated securely. Twist the bulb clockwise until it clicks into place.\n\nf. Replace any protective covers or guards around the bulb.\n\ng. Turn the power back on at the electrical panel or breaker box and test the light fixture to ensure it is working properly.\n\nRemember to handle halogen bulbs with care and avoid touching them with your bare hands to prolong their lifespan.",

        "llm_response": "Based on the provided passages, here is my answer:\n\nThe passage suggests that married men may have a wandering eye due to various reasons, including:\n\n1. Low self-esteem: According to passage 1, women who pursue married men may have low self-esteem, which could indicate that the man's attention is appreciated despite his marital status.\n2. Unmet needs: Passage 3 highlights that even seemingly happy marriages may lack fulfillment of certain needs, leading the husband to seek satisfaction elsewhere.\n3. Social pressure: The absence of societal expectations or consequences for extra-marital affairs may encourage married men to pursue other women (as suggested in passage 2).\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the answer to the question \"Why do seemingly happily married men have a wandering eye?\" is:\n\n\"Unable to answer based on given passages.\"",
