        "content": "Manuel María Smith Ibarra (4 January 1879 – 18 August 1956) was a Spanish architect. He carried out numerous constructions for the Basque bourgeoisie. He is considered the introducer of the English style in the Basque Country. He promoted low-density housing, considering it ideal for any social stratum. His best-known work was the San Mamés stadium, the football field in which Athletic Bilbao played its home matches until 2013.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nManuel María Smith was born on 4 January 1879 in Ronda Street in Bilbao into a bourgeois family, which was descended from Irish and settled in the capital of Biscay in the 18th century. He was the second of seven siblings from the marriage between José Maria Smith Arangüena, of Irish descent, and Alejandra Ybarra Aldape.\nAfter completing his Baccalaureate studies at the Jesuit school of Orduña, where he stood out for his gift for design, Smith began in 1896 his architectural studies at the Madrid School of Architecture, where he stood out for his exceptional ability, receiving the medal for distinguished student from King Alfonso XIII in 1902 and obtained his degree in January 1904. He later returned to his hometown and married María Dolores Prado Mathurin, beginning his professional practice shortly after.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\nIn 1903, Smith founded Smith Arquitectos on Gardoqui Street in Bilbao, later moving to Luchana Street, where the studio's offices are still located. Smith's first work, in 1904, was the house of Restituto Goyoaga, a friend and partner of the Smiths. A series of circumstances converged around this project, which would be repeated later until they came to characterize a large part of the architect's production, whose clientele was preferably made up of the Biscayan bourgeoisie, enriched as a consequence of industrial development. A large part of this group was united by ties of friendship or kinship with Smith and entrusted the technician with the design of their palaces and residences and, to a lesser extent, other real estate initiatives, such as hotels, housing estates, and tenement houses, as well as some factories and offices. Many of these industrialists and financiers acquired land in the municipality of Getxo, a town that throughout the second half of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th century underwent a notable expansion and acquired an eminently residential character. In this way, Smith ended up being an architect especially linked to the typology of the single-family home with most of his prolific production being located in the aforementioned town.\n\nThe Goyoaga house was followed by the houses of the Neguri Land Association. He soon acquired important clients in Bilbao society, building large residences and public buildings, reaching his peak between 1912 and 1930, as there was a boom in the economy due to the neutrality of the European war, thanks to which large industrial companies were created. As a result, his company also gained a great reputation, signing many projects and building many luxury houses, such as Victor Chavarri's Artaza mansion, on the Leioa road, the Martinez Rivas family mansion, Algorta; Emilio Ibarra's house, in Atxecoland (Getxo); Luis Lezama Leguizamon's palace, Getxon, and many other important buildings, such as the Hotel Carlton. Worthy of mention are Carlos Lewison's house, built in Neguri (Getxo) Port promenade, 1908 project; Luis Arana's house in Zuzazarte (Getxo); the new Atxuri station in Bilbao (1913–15), Tiro del Pichón, and the Antonio Garay Residence in Madrid are noteworthy from the first period.\nIn his first years as an architect, his name crossed the borders of Bilbao, but then the 1929 great economic crisis, which affected construction, put an end to it. The 1930s, however, was a radically different period as a result of the negative economic situation. The decrease in the number of commissions led Smith to participate in various competitions, although without success. His approach to rationalism dates back to this period, the style with which he designed Carlos Prado's tenement house.\n\n\n== Style ==\nAn eclectic architect, Smith expressed himself with mastery in the \"mountain\" and \"neo-Basque\" styles and he is also considered the greatest introducer and representative of the English style in the Basque Country, especially the variations of the Old English and Queen Anne styles. For instance, Smith's first work, the Goyoaga house, was designed following the fashions in force in British architecture of the time, something that would be inherent to the architect's work both stylistically and in spatial conception. Smith himself recorded these affinities in an article titled \"The English influence on our constructions\".\nThe first stage of Smith's production spans until 1930. During those years, in addition to the styles of English descent, with which he created some of his most important works such as the Cisco House or the Artaza Palace, he also made important contributions to regionalist architecture, especially in its Basque and mountain variants.\nAnglophilia in Biscay was evident in different areas since the Basque society showed its taste for English in sports, fashion, and architecture. Smith perfectly interpreted the different variants of that style of architecture and gave it a character that quickly took root within the sentiment of Basque society.\n\n\n== Social life ==\nSmith also participated in major cultural events in Bilbao, as a member of the Fine Arts Museums Committee, the Bizkaia Culture Committee, the Ethnographic Museum; he also promoted scholarships and exhibitions for artists and craftsmen.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, Smith moved with his family to Bordeaux. Once the war was over, he returned to Bilbao and found a Basque Country in ruins. From then on he began the last stage of his career, diverting his work towards multi-family housing. In 1939, Smith received the delicate commission for the architectural complex of the Plaza de los Fueros in Guernica, a project full of representativeness, given the brutal destruction that this town had suffered as a consequence of the fateful bombing of 1937.\n\n\n== Death ==\nSmith died in the Burdin Bidarte family home in Getxo on 18 August 1956, at the age of 77. At his funeral, José Félix de Lequerica stated that \"Manuel María Smith Ibarra taught us how to live\", which is a reference to Smith's work in the single-family home and the complacency that his work caused among his clients.\n\n\n== Important works ==\nHouse of Restituto Goyaga (Bilbao)\nHouses of the Sociedad de Terrenos (Neguri)\nEmilio Ibarra's house (Bilbao)\nLuis Arana's house (Bilbao)\nHotel Carlton (Bilbao)\nSota House (Bilbao)\nKai Alde House (Bilbao)\nArtaza Palace by Víctor Chávarri (Leioia)\nPalace of the Martínez Rivas family (Algorta)\nPalace of Luis Lezama Leguizamón (Getxo)\nPalace of the Marquis of Olaso (Getxo)\nPalace of Bake Eder (Getxo)\nResidence of Antonio Garay (Madrid)\nSan Mamés Stadium  (Bilbao)\nAtxuri station (Bilbao)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Manuel Rodríguez Arzuaga (1876 – 5 September 1952) was a Spanish versatile athlete and a football executive. He is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the amateur beginnings of Atlético Madrid since he was one of its founders in 1903, a vice president between 1903 and 1905, and the club's first-ever patron. He invested most of his own capital in Atlético, saving the club from bankruptcy during its moments of financial difficulties. His high economic position was fundamental in helping Atlético to build the Campo de O'Donnell in 1913. He was also credited with the payment for Atlético's first red-and-white shirts in 1911, and the club's first-ever match outside of Madrid in Alicante was promoted and financed by him. He was named an honorary president of the club in 1916.\nIn 1903, he founded a foot race competition in Madrid, which became the most important event in Madrid athletics, and in 1910, he founded a football competition in the same city. In both cases, he donated a trophy to the winner, the so-called Copa Rodríguez Arzuaga, hence the name of both competitions. He also held the position of director of the Spanish Football Federation.\nHe was an all-round and versatile athlete, playing both football and field hockey for Atlético when necessary, running foot races, and even coaching tennis. He also played rugby in France and football and rowing in England.\n\n\n== Early and personal life ==\nManuel Rodríguez Arzuaga was born in 1876 in Laciana, as the son of Manuel Rodríguez y Rodriguez and Catalina Arzuaga y Garmendia. He was one of a total of eleven siblings (7 men and 4 women) who were involved in several businesses and linked to many companies that were emblematic in the Province of León and outside of it, such as Tapicerías Rodríguez Hermanos and, later, in Madrid, the popular Almacenes Rodríguez on Gran Vía, which were inaugurated by King Alfonso XIII.\nDuring his youth, Rodríguez Arzuaga traveled a lot, and in one of his trips, to London, he discovered the game of football and developed a deep interest in it. It is said that he was the one who brought the first ball to Madrid. He also practiced rowing in England and played rugby in France. He was a student at the Institución Libre de Enseñanza.\nHe never married.\n\n\n== Sporting career ==\n\n\n=== Founding Athletic de Madrid ===\nOn 26 April 1903, Rodríguez Arzuaga was a member of the group led by Eduardo de Acha that met the representatives of Athletic Club, who had just won the 1903 Copa del Rey final, to request permission to create the club's Madrid branch, Athletic Madrid, an idea that was very well received, and thus that club was born. He appeared on the club's second board of directors in 1903 as the vice president (replacing Juan de Zabala) under the presidency of Eduardo de Acha, a position that he held for two years until 1905.\n\n\n=== Foot races ===\nIn 1903, the same year that the football team was founded, the Athletic Club of Madrid launched its athletics section. Rodríguez Arzuaga was an athletic partner, and in 1903, he organized a foot race through the streets of Madrid, which was won by the Swiss Charles Robert Ruesch, followed by four teammates, all of them members of the Athletic Club of Madrid, which was proclaimed champion of the tournament. He donated a trophy valued at 500 pesetas to the winner, the so-called Copa Rodríguez Arzuaga, so the competition was named as such. Athletic and the local newspaper Heraldo de Madrid continued organizing it while Rodríguez Arzuaga continued to donate the trophy.\nAthletic continued to compete for the Copa Rodríguez Arzuaga, the main athletics tournament in Madrid of the time, with its most notable opponent being Sociedad Gimnástica, which won it in 1904. On 22 April 1905, on the verge of the club's second anniversary, Athletic's Ruesch won another race, ahead of José Nogues (Gimnástica) and Jerónimo López (Athletic). Athletics continued to mark an era in Madrid life and in that of Athletic, who organized other prestigious tournaments such as the Madrid Olympic Games in 1914, where Garnica (discus) Alberto Vivanco (hammer), and Linnae (ball) led their respective disciplines and the first two even broke national records.\nIn addition to football and athletics, the club also had a tennis section in its first years. In 1907, Antonio Vega de Seoane was the first captain of the tennis section, and Fernando de Asuero was the second captain, while Rodríguez Arzuaga simply worked as a tennis coach.\n\n\n=== Patron of Athletic de Madrid ===\nRodríguez Arzuaga then dedicated most of his youthful efforts to Atlético as he invested most of his time and energy in the club, and most importantly, his money as well. A true colchonero, he put financial resources from his own pocket at the disposal of the club when its disappearance loomed due to bankruptcy and major financial problems. He is thus considered one of the saviors of Atlético de Madrid, the other being Francisco Vives.\nOn 8 November 1907, Rodríguez Arzuaga started in a friendly match against Club Español de Madrid, scoring the opening goal in an eventual 2–0 victory.\nIn the spring of 1909, a team from Alicante invited Atlético to play a match there, offering them 250 pesetas to pay for the trip. The amount was clearly insufficient, so the players who could, had to pay for their tickets, and those who could not, were invited by Rodríguez Arzuaga, who covered the rest of the expenses, thus playing a crucial role in helping Atlético make this excursion to play away from Madrid for the first time in their history.\nIn 1910, he founded the Copa Rodríguez Arzuaga, a friendly football competition contested by clubs from Madrid that was named in honor of the donator of the trophy, Rodríguez Arzuaga, who did so to create greater motivation. He paid for the expenses, trips, referee fee, the trophies, and soon the kits too, because, in January 1911, he approached Juanito Elorduy regarding the red and white shirts that he had brought from Southampton to Athletic Bilbao, so that he would bring them from his home in Bilbao to Madrid, stating \"When you return to Madrid after Epiphany, you can bring them with you, I will pay for them all\". Atlético played its first game as a red and white team in the second edition of the Copa Rodríguez Arzuaga against Sociedad Gimnástica on 22 January 1911, which ended in the latter side withdrawing. Atlético only won one Rodríguez Arzuaga cup, in 1914.\nHis high economic position was fundamental in helping Atlético to build the Campo de O'Donnell in 1913. The construction began at the end of 1912, and the project was carried out only thanks to the financial contribution of Rodríguez Arzuaga, patron of the club, who put up 30,000 pesetas (which at the time represented a fortune) to prepare the land and pay for the 600 linear meters of wood used in the fenced.\nIn 1916, and at the request of the then president Julián Ruete, it was unanimously accepted to appoint Manuel Rodríguez Arzuaga as honorary president, in recognition of his essential help to the club in several very delicate moments in its history. Finally, on 25 October 1930, a group of 50 venerable \"colchoneros\" gathered together and decided to create a club that they would call \"The 50\", of which Rodríguez Arzuaga would be its first partner.\n\n\n== Other activities ==\nOn 11 November 1909, Rodríguez Arzuaga appeared on the first board of directors of the Spanish Football Federation, being elected as a member alongside the likes of Narciso Masferrer and Joan Gamper, under the presidency of Pedro Neyra.\nRodríguez Arzuaga organized the summer camps of the School Institute in San Vicente de la Barquera and in 1912, he financed the construction of the shelter house of the Free Education Institution, in the Sierra de Guadarrama.\nOn 29 April 1917, he was the referee of the second replay of a Copa del Rey semifinal tie between Madrid FC and FC Espanya, which ended in a 1–0 victory in favour of his hometown club thanks to a second-half penalty that he awarded to Madrid.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nRodríguez Arzuaga is remembered among the whitewashed walls of their family home in San Miguel de Laciana. His great-great-grandson Jorge de Orueta, would become an ambassador of Spain in Cameroon.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Manuel de la Sota Aburto, also known as Manu Sota (27 July 1897 – 29 December 1979), was a Spanish promoter of Basque culture, a writer, and a nationalist politician. He was a cultural promoter, delegate of the Basque Government in exile, academic of Euskaltzaindia, but he is best known for being the 11th president of Athletic Bilbao.\nHis cousin Alejandro de la Sota was also a president of Athletic Bilbao, and as Basque nationalists, both of them strengthened the philosophy known as cantera within the club, which resounded over the idea of not using foreigners, only Basques, hence creating the club's infamous signing policy.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nManuel de la Sota was born on 27 July 1897 in Las Arenas, as the son of businessman and ruling politician Ramon de la Sota and Catalina Trinidad de Aburto y Uribe.\nThe de la Sota family, which had significant assets in Altos Hornos, the largest company in Spain for much of the 20th century, was the richest family on the entire coast of the Bay of Biscay. Being the son of a well-off family, de la Sota studied law at the University of Salamanca and Cambridge, teaching several years at the latter University. When he returned to Biscay, de la Sota became active in Basque nationalism, and when the division of Basque nationalism occurred in 1921, he did not hesitate to stay in the pro-independence faction, Aberri's Basque Nationalist Party (EAJ). In fact, de la Sotas were economic supporters of what would become the EAJ. His older brother, also named Ramon (1887–1978), also became a nationalist politician.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\nTogether with his close friend Eli Gallastegui and the painter José María Ucelay, de la Sota was one of the main promoters of the propagandist theater movement. Under his direction, his works or adaptations by various authors were performed, such as Libe from Sabino Arana and Pedro Mari from Arturo Campión. Even though he wrote most of his works in Spanish, he had them translated into Basque and published them. He published most of his works in the magazines Pyrenaica, Euzkadi, and Euzkerea, becoming a director of the former between 1928 and 1930. As for his production in Basque, he carried it out with the help of his teacher of the Basque language, the poet \"Lauaxeta\", or were simply translated by José de Altuna or by Paul Guilsou, which was the case with Bihotz apala. On the other hand, he also worked extensively on the Diccionario Retana de Autoridades de la Lengua Basque (Retana Dictionary of Basque Language Authorities).\nHis friendship with Gallastegui rendered Sota to follow him in his nationalist orientation that promoted the Mendigoizale movement, despite which he always collaborated with José Antonio de Aguirre, a future Lendakari. Despite being a pro-independence, de la Sota did not ignore the important literary movement that was developing in the rest of the country at that time, the so-called generation of '27, and his collaborations, along with those of Ucelay, can be seen in the Revista de Occidente, La Gaceta Literaria, Litoral, Et cetera. He then established his pseudonym Txanka in the Basque press.\n\n\n== Gastronomic career ==\nBetween 16 and 23 February 1928, de la Sota published in the Excelsior, which was owned by his family, a delicious gastronomic epistolary that, in seven installments and dedicated to the then director of the newspaper Jacinto Miquelarena, served him to present his personal theses about food, drink and good living. In his articles he displayed a cosmopolitan and refined taste with nods to local products or recipes and, despite having studied in England, throughout his seven chapters he revealed to have a rather Francophile palate. Aside from a brief initial discussion about whether to say mahonesa or mayonesa, the text begins by revealing that his true interest was not in the plates but in the glasses, writing extensively about wine; when to drink it, at what temperature and even how to appreciate it.\n\n\n== Sporting career ==\nIn 1926, de la Sota was appointed as the 11th president of Athletic Bilbao (replacing Ricardo de Irezabal), a position that he held for three years until 1929, when he was replaced by Manuel Castellanos. During his mandate the club did not win anything of significance, but he successfully led the club towards the new times of professional football in Spain and the foundation of the national league.\nHis status as president of Athletic Bilbao, earned him the appointment of a member of Sports in 1932 on the Permanent Board of the Society of Basque Studies, a position in which he remained until 1936. In addition to football, de la Sota also loved mountaineering, which highlights his attachment to modernist ideas and aesthetics.\nIn 1937, de la Sota went into exile and began to develop intense propaganda work, participating in different propaganda missions promoted by the Basque Government during the tour of the Basque Country national football team around the world that began in April. In the tour of the Eresoinka group since December, being the author of the composition and plot of the Akerlanda painting.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nBefore the Spanish Civil War, de la Sota was a great supporter of the theater, and during the war, he moved to Miarritza. In 1940, de la Sota was part of the delegation of the Basque Government in New York City, where he collaborated until 1946 when, after the Second World War, he returned to his home in Biarritz. The fruit of his stay in his Yankee outfit were unimportant conversations about the inhabitants of the new Anglo-Saxon world.\nIn Laburdi, where de la Sota lived with his brother Ramón until his death, he dedicated himself fully to Basque studies. He was one of the organizers of the Biarritz Congress of Basque Studies (1948). He was also named academic of the rebuilt post-war Euskaltzaindia. He established an important library that he later donated, along with many other objects (engravings, etchings, drawings, maps) to the Basque Museum in Bayonne.\n\n\n== Death ==\nDe la Sota died in Bilbao at the house of his nephew Patrick, in the town where he was born, on 29 December 1979, at the age of 82.\nBeginning in 1919, the Sota family donated several paintings to the  Bilbao Fine Arts Museum. In 1979, Manuel bequeathed a splendid screen by José María Ucelay dating from 1935. In 2008, Bilbao Fine Arts Museum purchased a painting called \"Artists’ Night, Ibaigane\" from the Sota heirs, which had been painted for Manuel by Antonio de Guezala.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\nIxaro-Ixarra (1930)\nOztin (1932)\nNegarrez igaro zan atsua (The old woman cried).

        "content": "Manuel del Castillo de Arechaga (25 November 1884 – 5 April 1969) was a Spanish footballer who played as a midfielder for RCD Espanyol.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\n\n\n=== Club career ===\nManuel del Castillo was born on 25 November 1884 in Paris, and when he was young his family settled in Barcelona, where he began his football career at FC Internacional in 1901. Together with Paco Bru, Charles Wallace, and the Peris brothers (Agustin and Enrique), he helped the club achieve three successive runner-up finishes in the Catalan championship between 1904 and 1906, losing out on the title to a different opponent each time, Club Español (now RCD Espanyol) FC Barcelona and X Sporting Club respectively. In 1906, the club had to suspend its activities due to a lack of players, so most of the remaining FCI players joined FC Barcelona for the 1906–07 season, but del Castillo took a different path as he instead decided to join Barça's city rivals, FC Espanya de Barcelona.\nIn 1909, del Castillo signed for RCD Espanyol, being a member of the great Espanyol side of the 1910s that had the likes of Bru, Emilio Sampere, and the Wallace brothers (Charles and Percy), winning the Catalan championship in 1911–12, as well as reaching the 1911 Copa del Rey final, in which he started alongside the likes of Sampere, Armando Giralt, and Antonio Neyra, and which they lost 1–3 to Athletic Bilbao.\n\n\n=== International career ===\nIn May 1903, the 19-year-old del Castillo, along with many other players, was elected by majority vote as a substitute for a match with the Barcelona City team.\nOn 18 November 1909, del Castillo earned his only cap for the Catalan national team in a match against Equip Blanc (White Team) at the Camp de la Indústria, on the occasion of a benefit match for the injured people in the Second Melillan campaign, starting in a 2–6 loss.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nRCD Espanyol\nCatalan championship:\nChampions (1): 1911–12\nCopa del Rey:\nRunner-up (1): 1911\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sir Edward Hulse, 1st Baronet (1682 – 10 April 1759) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHulse was the eldest son of Dr. Edward Hulse. He graduated M.B. at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1704, and M.D. in 1717. He joined the College of Physicians of London in 1717, became censor for a first time in 1720, and councillor in 1750, 1751, and 1753. He was in leading physician's practice in London along with John Freind, Richard Mead, Hans Sloane, and others. He was one of Freind's sureties before the latter was committed to the Tower. He is described as one of the `whig doctors,' and is said to have differed so seriously with Freind over the case of Lord Townshend that he withdrew, declaring that his lordship must die if Freind had his way (Townshend recovered, having declared he would live or die by the hands of Freind). He was first physician to George II, and was made a baronet on 7 February 1738–9. In 1745 he was attacked with others in several pamphlets, on their treatment of the Earl of Orford. He retired from practice some years before his death, and lived at his house on Dartford Heath, Kent. In 1738 he purchased the estate of Breamore, Hampshire, which is held by his successors in the title. In his old age he was possessed by the idea that he would die of want, a fear which his attendants overcame by putting guineas regularly into the pocket where he used to deposit his fees. He died on 10 April 1759, and was buried in the churchyard of Wilmington, Kent. A portrait by Francis Cotes has been engraved by James Watson. He married, in 1713, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Richard Levett, knt., who had been lord mayor in 1700, and had issue by her. His son Edward, who succeeded to the title, was father of Sir Samuel Hulse. Another son, Richard, inherited his house and manor at Dartford.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHulse baronets\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Creighton, Charles (1891). \"Hulse, Edward (1682-1759)\".

        "content": "The Forum of Small States (FOSS) is a voluntary, informal and non-ideological grouping of countries at the United Nations, founded in 1992 by Singapore. Since then, Singapore has served as Chair of FOSS. The Forum of Small States is open to countries with a population of fewer than 10 million, although the population of some members has exceeded that level since they joined the group.\nThe term \"small state\" is similar to the term microstate or ministate, a sovereign state having a very small population or land area, usually both. However, the meanings of \"state\" and \"very small\" are not well-defined in international law.\nThe international system is for the most part made up by small powers or small states. While a small power in the international system may never equal or surpass the effect of larger powers, they can nevertheless influence the workings of the international system together with others.\nAccording to a 2017 review study, \"What scholars can agree on is that small states generally prefer multilateralism as both a path to influence and a means to restrain larger states. Studies of influential small states indicate that they are able to develop issue-specific power to make up for what they lack in aggregate structural power. Small states can, therefore, develop power disproportionate relative to their size on the few issues of utmost importance to them. In addition to prioritization, small states have successfully employed the strategies of coalition-building and image-building. Even though small state administrations lack the resources of their larger counterparts, their informality, flexibility, and the autonomy of their diplomats can prove advantageous in negotiations and within institutional settings.\"\nSmall states make up the majority of United Nations member states and they have served as key drafters, negotiators, and thought leaders on a variety of issues at the UN. However, small states face significant structural and capacity barriers to their effective participation in diplomacy and policymaking at the UN.\nFOSS now comprises 108 countries across all geographical regions and at various levels of development and members meet several times a year to discuss issues of concern to small states. \n\n\n== Founding ==\nThe Permanent Representative of Singapore to the UN, Chew Tai Soo, assumed his role in 1991 and said he was struck by three shortcomings which small member states of the UN faced:  \n\nFirst, small states particularly those which do not belong to a recognised grouping were often excluded from the inner sanctums of negotiations... Second, and related to the first, small countries often lacked in-depth information on what went on in the UN; unless they had a team of very active diplomats. Third, and most critically small states had by tradition been proportionally under-represented in the principal organs of the UN and boards of the UN specialised agencies. This came about because it was difficult for small states to be elected to these organs and agencies. I had observed at the 1991 Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) elections that the big regional countries were easily elected at the first round of voting. The smaller countries were then left to fight over the remaining seats.\nFollowing discussions, the core group that was convened by Singapore to form FOSS were:\n\n\n== Challenges for small states ==\nSmall states face structural and capacity barriers to their participation in diplomacy and policymaking at the UN because their foreign ministries and missions are smaller than their larger counterparts, the relative costs of engagement are higher for small states and they often face capacity problems in filtering and processing the vast quantities of information they do receive.\nThe countries designated as small states include some of the most and least developed nations, resource-rich and resource-scarce countries, and both island and landlocked states. The diversity of small states is significant, in terms of their circumstances, interests, policy priorities, and resources. These significant differences limit the extent to which small states can cooperate on policy issues or come together as a single negotiating bloc.\nIn 2012, at the 20th anniversary of the formation of FOSS, then UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon noted some of the reasons the group was formed:\n\nSmall developing States face special challenges. Landlocked developing countries find themselves marginalized from the world economy, cut-off from global flows of knowledge, technology, capital and innovations, and unable to benefit substantially from external trade. The small island developing States continue to be on the frontlines in dealing with the adverse effects of climate change and sea level rise.\nFrom telecommunications and electricity to education and health, many of the problems faced by the small island developing States, located deep in the middle of oceans, are similar to the transportation challenges faced by the landlocked countries of the Himalayas.\nIn 2019 in his remarks to the Small States Forum, UN Secretary-General António Guterres noted that small states are especially vulnerable to climate change and should not be expected to pay for climate disasters alone:Over the past 20 years, more than 90 percent of disasters - droughts, floods, hurricanes and fires - were climate-related. Economic losses alone are estimated at more than $2.2 trillion and the human toll falls largely on low-income countries. These disasters constitute a major impediment to sustainable development.\nFor small states, recovery and reconstruction bills, including the cost of restoring people’s livelihoods, can total more than 100 per cent of Gross Domestic Product. Successive storms can trap small island states in particular in an accelerating cycle of disaster and debt...\n\nMany small states, including middle-income countries, are highly vulnerable to external shocks of all kinds. As a result, the debt levels of small states are on average higher than other developing countries. Many are currently under debt distress or face a high risk of debt distress. \nBut small states also have certain advantages, as noted by Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong: \n\nWe can respond more nimbly and adapt more easily to changing circumstances. Our sense of insecurity and even paranoia are also constructive as they motivate us to deal more decisively with challenges and threats. With our options more constrained, our collective minds are more readily focussed, and we are less hampered by regional interests and differences, or multiple levels of government, that bigger countries have to grapple with.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nIn 2022, “FOSS for Good” was launched, a technical assistance package to provide a peer-learning platform for FOSS members to share experiences, best practices, and solutions to tackle common challenges.\nIn January 2024, PassBlue, a New York City-based nonprofit that observes and independently reports on activities at and involving the UN, launched a series on multi-lateralism and small states. Articles focused on the challenges to small states in general, as well as profiles of specific challenges for Armenia and Gambia. \nSingapore hosted a study visit by 12 Permanent Representatives to the UN in New York from 19 to 23 February 2024 under the 12th FOSS Fellowship Programme. These Permanent Representatives were from Botswana, Burundi, Cabo Verde, Fiji, Grenada, Kyrgyzstan, Lesotho, Micronesia, Nauru, Senegal, Suriname and Tuvalu. \n\n\n== Current members ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nASEAN\nGroup of 77\nLeast developed countries\nPacific Islands Forum\nSmall Island Developing States\nSoutheast Asia Treaty Organisation\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Elizabeth Anne Lewis (née Lewis; 1843/48-1924) was a British temperance activist and local missionary. Throughout her life, she was devoted to the moral suasion phase of the temperance movement. \nShe was a vice-president of the British Temperance League, the London Temperance Hospital, the Women's Total Abstinence Union, and the National British Temperance Association. She held the United Kingdom Alliance in  high regard.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nElizabeth Anne (or Ann) Lewis was born at Market Drayton, Shropshire, March 10, 1843/48.Both of her parents were strong adherents of total abstinence, her father, George Lewis, holding outdoor temperance meetings in his home town on Sunday afternoons, which he addressed from the Shambles Steps. He was generally accompanied by his young daughter, Elizabeth Anne. Mrs. Annie Lewis (died 1892), mother of Mrs. Elizabeth Anne Lewis, was connected with the temperance movement for upwards of 45 years.She was educated at a private school at Newcastle-under-Lyme.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1867, Miss Lewis married her cousin Thomas Lewis(born 1843), of Sandbach. He was a life abstainer, and was a worker in the temperance cause from boyhood. The young couple made their home first at Wigan, and the following year, removed to Blackburn, where Mr. Lewis began business as a coachbuilder. Both husband and wife being accomplished pianists, they frequently gave their services at Band of Hope temperance societies and similar organizations.Lewis began her active temperance work in 1882, in connection with a Blue Ribbon Mission held in the Exchange Hall, Blackburn. When the Blue Ribbon Mission was over, Lewis, who was afraid that the temperance enthusiasm might die out, formed a mission of her own. She made a house-to-house visitation of the persons who had attended the Blue Ribbon meetings, and, to assist her, hired a temperance missionary, Richard Killshaw. Her mission was announced to open on September 1, 1883, and thousands of temperance tracts, inviting people to come, were distributed at the local mills and factories. To the great disappointment of the promoter, only six persons came to the meeting. But she was not disheartened, as all of the six signed the pledge and four of them kept it.In the course of a few years, Lewis became an effective public speaker, and addressed audiences on temperance in most of the large towns of England and Wales. At first, her mission was called \"Mrs. Lewis’s Temperance Mission\", but later, the word \"Teetotal\" was substituted for \"Temperance\", at the wish of Lewis herself. Her mission grew rapidly, being forced several times to seek new quarters. In 1884, it was located in Spinners Hall, St. Peter Street, where Lewis started a series of Saturday night entertainments as a counter-attraction to the public house musical programs. Regular Sunday meetings, also, were instituted, the first speaker being Dr. Frederic Richard Lees. The first year of the mission produced very good results. At the end of this period, Lewis was invited to lay the foundation-stone of the New Congregational Church at Witton, and nearly 400 reformed alcoholics, many of them Roman Catholics, walked in procession to the site of the new church. In 1889 she sued a local publican for libel. He had alleged that she was in a sexual relationship with her assistant and she believed that this effected both her own and the reputation of her mission. Over £300 was raised by the public to cover her legal fees and she won the case.The mission remained at Spinners’ Hall till 1891, when it was moved to a new building erected by Mr. Lewis for his wife over his workshops in St. Peter Street. This was called \"Lees Hall\" after Dr. Frederic Richard Lees, who opened it with a dedicatory address. It is estimated that between one and two thousand people signed a pledge of abstinence every year. Each week there would be alcohol free entertainment at the Lees Hall. Up to 600 people would pay a penny each to see dramas, listen to musicians or hear lectures.Lewis was the first woman in England to be granted the privilege of addressing prisoners in Lancaster Gaol in 1909.She was known as the \"Temperance Queen\", and \"The Drunkard's Friend\". She received several public pecuniary presents in recognition of her public work. In 1913, when King George V and Queen Mary visited Blackburn, she was presented to them as a representative citizen. For 30 years Lewis conducted her Mission, with a single vacation that did not exceed a fortnight. She was a vice-president of the British Temperance League, the London Temperance Hospital, the Women's Total Abstinence Union, and the National British Temperance Association.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nShe died at Blackburn, Lancashire, March 14, 1924. In her will, she left several legacies to the leading temperance organizations of the U.K. On October 24, 1925, a memorial cross, erected on her grave, was unveiled by John Oates, the first man to sign the total-abstinence pledge with Lewis at the Blue Ribbon Mission in 1882. Lewis is included in the ODNB.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"The 'Drunkard’s Friend' who hoped to turn Blackburn teetotal\", by John Anson, 10 June 2023, Lancashire Telegraph\n\"Elizabeth Lewis – a temperance campaigner who inspired one small step in the battle for sexual equality\", 3 November 2014, via rosblackcreative.com",

He graduated M.A. at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1660, and was ejected from the college for nonconformity soon after. His name appears in the Leyden register of students of medicine, under date 4 July 1668. He graduated M.D. there, became physician to the court of the Prince of Orange, and was incorporated M.D. at Oxford on 20 December 1670, on the nomination of that prince. He joined the College of Physicians in 1675, became a fellow 1677, censor 1682, and subsequently Harveian orator 1704, and treasurer 1704 to 1709. He died on 3 December 1711, in his eighty-first year, and is described in the annals of the college as 'a person of great skill in the practice of physick.' He married Dorothy, daughter of Thomas Westrow of Twickenham, by whom he was father of Sir Edward Hulse.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Creighton, Charles (1891). \"Hulse, Edward (1631-1711)\".

        "content": "The 2024 Thurrock Council election is due to be held on 2 May 2024 to elect a third of the members of Thurrock Council in Essex, England. It will be held on the same day as other local elections across England, including the 2024 Essex police and crime commissioner election.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAt the previous council election in May 2023, the Labour opposition led by John Kent made gains against the incumbent Conservative administration led by Mark Coxshall. Labour gained five seats, increasing its total share of seats in the council to 19. The Conservatives, now having 26 seats, retained control of the council but saw their majority reduced to three. The Thurrock Independents lost two seats but held one, leaving them with a single councillor. The election also returned three independents not affiliated to any party. Coxshall lost his seat in the election, and later in the month the council elected Conservative Andrew Jefferies as the new leader of the council.\nIn July 2023, Conservative councillor Sue Sammons left her party to become an independent in protest of its decision to cut local bus services. This action left the Conservatives with a majority of two on the council. In the same month, the Thurrock Independents de-registered as a political party. The make-up of the council now consisted of five seats being held by independents, 19 held by Labour and 25 held by the Conservatives. The independents in the council later organised themselves into a single group, the Non-Political Alliance of Independent Councillors (NPAIC), with councillor Neil Speight as their spokesman. NPAIC candidates are running in this election as independents.\nIn February 2024, it was revealed that the Conservative administration was considering an increase in council tax of 7.99% from April to present a balanced budget for 2024–2025. Council tax had already been increased by 10% the previous year as a condition for additional financial support from the government to help reduce the council's £636 million deficit. The administration also planned to make savings of £18.2 million over the next two years. It had already introduced several measures to cut spending, which included a 7.7% increase in rent for council housing and an introduction of charges for school transport among other measures.\nThe Conservative administration put forward its economic proposals in its budget for 2024–2025, which was voted on by councillors in March 2024. Conservative councillors were whipped to vote in favour of the budget. Labour abstained from the vote, allowing the budget to pass. Two Conservative councillors, Jack Duffin and Alex Anderson, rebelled against the party leadership and voted against the budget with three NPAIC councillors. Duffin and Anderson were subsequently suspended from the Conservative group as a disciplinary measure and became independents, resulting in the Conservatives losing their majority and the council falling under no overall control. Duffin and Anderson did not join the NPAIC and have instead sat alone as unaffiliated independents. Following their suspension, the Conservatives have continued to run the council in a minority administration.\n\n\n== Election ==\nThe election is due to be held on 2 May 2024, the same day as other local elections across England. Under its current electoral system, elections to the council are held annually every three in four years, with a third of its 49 councillors elected to represent one of its 20 wards for a term of four years at each election. As such, three wards will not be contested this year, including Stifford Clays, Little Thurrock Rectory, and Tilbury Riverside and Thurrock Park. This will be the last election held under this system, as all 49 seats will be contested in elections every four years from May 2025 onwards following reforms implemented by the government as part of its ongoing intervention in the council after its effective bankruptcy in 2022. Electors will also be able to vote in the 2024 Essex police and crime commissioner election which is being held on the same day, including in the wards which are not up for contention in this council election.\nThe Labour Party and the Conservative Party will stand in every ward at the election. It is expected that the low national polling numbers of the Conservatives, as well as the financial difficulties faced by the council during the Conservative administration, will influence the outcome of the election, with local election experts Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher suggesting that Labour could regain its traditional control of the council. According to its leader John Kent, Labour \"cannot promise the earth\" amid the financial burden faced by the council but will focus on maintaining public services and being open and transparent, protecting services for the elderly and the young while maintaining basic services. The strengthened local presence of independent candidates and the Green Party led by Eugene McCarthy, standing in seven and four wards respectively, is also expected to pose a potential challenge to the Conservatives. According to McCarthy, the Greens will focus on building new council homes, investing in high streets and delivering \"common-sense\" finances.\n\n\n== Results ==\nThe Statement of Persons Nominated, which details the candidates standing in each ward, was released by Thurrock Council following the close of nominations on 5 April 2023. One candidate will be elected per ward. The final results are expected to be declared overnight at around 3AM on 3 May 2024.\n\n\n=== Aveley & Uplands ===\n\n\n=== Belhus ===\n\n\n=== Chadwell St. Mary ===\n\n\n=== Chafford & North Stifford ===\n\n\n=== Corringham & Fobbing ===\n\n\n=== East Tilbury ===\n\n\n=== Grays Riverside ===\n\n\n=== Grays Thurrock ===\n\n\n=== Little Thurrock Blackshots ===\n\n\n=== Ockendon ===\n\n\n=== Orsett ===\n\n\n=== South Chafford ===\n\n\n=== Stanford East & Corringham Town ===\n\n\n=== Stanford-Le-Hope West ===\n\n\n=== The Homesteads ===\n\n\n=== Tilbury St. Chads ===\n\n\n=== West Thurrock & South Stifford ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Gaza Strip has been under military occupation by Israel since 6 June 1967, when Israeli forces captured the territory, then administered by Egypt, during the Six-Day War. Although Israel unilaterally withdrew from the Gaza Strip in 2005, the United Nations, international human rights organizations and several legal scholars regard the Gaza Strip to still be under military occupation by Israel, as Israel still maintains direct control over Gaza's air and maritime space, six of Gaza's seven land crossings, a no-go buffer zone within the territory, and the Palestinian population registry. Israel continues to maintain a blockade of the Gaza Strip, limiting the movement of goods and people in and out of the Gaza Strip. The blockade has been categorized as a form of occupation and illegal collective punishment.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1956–1957 Israeli occupation ===\n\n\n=== 1967–1993 Israeli military administration ===\n\n\n=== 2005 Israeli disengagement from Gaza ===\n\n\n=== 2023 Israel–Hamas war ===\n\nIn early January 2024, during the Israel–Hamas war, Israel reoccupied most of the northern Gaza Strip after Israel claimed that it had dismantled 12 Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades battalions on 7 January. This led to the beginning of the Insurgency in the North Gaza Strip and also the beginning of the Israeli reoccupation of the Gaza Strip, some 19 years after Israel had disengaged from the Gaza Strip in 2005 due to stiff resistance from the Palestinians. However, Israel has been continuously imposing a blockade of the Gaza Strip since 2007. \nAt the beginning of the Israel–Hamas war, Israel made it clear that controlling the Gaza Strip was one of the main goals. In late January 2024, Benjamin Netanyahu said that he \"will not compromise on full Israeli control\" over Gaza.\nIn March 2024, Israel started carving through farmland and demolishing Palestinian homes and schools in the Gaza Strip to create a new buffer zone. Palestinians would be barred from the new buffer zone in Gaza.\n\n\n== Israeli settlements ==\n\nBy 2005, there were 9,000 Israeli settlers spread across 21 Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip, while around 1.3 million Palestinians lived there. The first settlement was built in 1970, soon after Israel occupied the Gaza Strip following the Six-Day War. Each Israeli settler disposed of 400 times the land available to the Palestinian refugees, and 20 times the volume of water allowed to the peasant farmers of the Strip. Following disengagement from the Gaza Strip in 2005, all Israeli settlers were evacuated and all settlements were dismantled.\nIn late January 2024, it was reported by an unnamed Israeli military officer that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others in the government had requested that military members begin to establish permanent bases in the Gaza Strip amid the 2023 Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPolicy paper: Options for a policy regarding Gaza's civilian population\nIsraeli-occupied territories\nIsraeli occupation of the West Bank\nIsrael and apartheid\nList of Israeli settlements\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\"From 'Occupied Territories' to 'Disputed Territories'\" by Dore Gold\n\"Israeli Water Interests in the Occupied Territories\", from Security for Peace: Israel's Minimal Security Requirements in Negotiations with the Palestinians Archived 2005-10-30 at the Wayback Machine, by Ze'ev Schiff, 1989.

        "content": "William Oliver (1659 – 4 April 1716) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nOliver was born in 1659. He belonged to the family of Oliver dwelling at Trevarnoe, in Sithney, Cornwall. He was entered in the physic line at Leyden University on 17 December 1683, when aged 24, but his medical studies were interrupted by his joining the Duke of Monmouth's expedition to England, and serving with the troops as one of their three surgeons (Roberrts, Life of Monmouth, i. 253). After its defeat, he rode off the field with the duke, Lord Grey, and a few others. When they had ridden about twenty miles he proposed to the duke to turn off to the sea-coast of Somerset, seize a passage-boat at Uphill, and cross to Wales. This advice was not adopted, and Oliver rode away to Bristol, about twelve miles distant (Oldmixion, History under the Stuarts, p. 704). There he concealed himself with his friends, and, after the ‘bloody assizes,’ travelled to London with the clerk of Judge Jeffreys, to whom he had been recommended by a tory friend. He then escaped to the continent, and made his way to Holland. In 1685 he was at Königsberg in Prussia, and he spent one winter in the most northern part of Poland; but his name appears again in the list of the students at Leyden on 17 February 1688. He accompanied William III to England in 1688 as an officer in his army, and was soon rewarded for his services. On 30 September 1692 Oliver qualified as a licentiate of the College of Physicians at London, and he held from 27 April 1698 to 1702 the post of physician to the red squadron. This cause him to he with the fleet at Cadiz in 1694, and to spend two summers in the Mediterranean, during which period he eagerly prosecuted his inquiries in medicine and science. Extracts from two letters written by Oliver when with the fleet were communicated by Walter Moyle to the ‘Philosophical Transactions,' xvii. 908-12, and a third letter, written at the same period, was published in the same 'Transactions,’ xxiv. 562–4. A letter ‘on his late journey into Denmark and Holland' about 1701, also appeared in the ‘Philosophical Transactions,’ xxiii. 1400–10. These communications led to his election as F.R.S. on 5 January 1703–4. From 1702 to 1709 he dwelt in London and Bath, his ‘Practical Essay' being dated from ‘Red Lion Court in Fleet Street, July 10, 1704;’ ‘but it is doubtful whether he ever practised at Bath’ (Falconer, Bath Hospital, ed. 1888, p. 11). From 1709 to 1714 he was a physician to the hospital at Chatham for sick and wounded seamen, and from 1714 to 1716 he was physician to the Royal Hospital at Greenwich. He died unmarried at Greenwich on 4 April 1716, and was buried in the abbey church at Bath, where a monument was erected to his memory.\nOliver published in 1704 ‘A practical Essay en Fevers, containing Remarks on the hot and cold Methods of their Cure,' at 202 of which begins ‘a Dissertation on the hot waters of Bathe,' the first draft of his subsequent work. The essay, through its author's references to Dr. Radcliffe, was attacked in ‘A Letter to Dr. Oliver, during him to reconcile some few of the contradictory assertions in his has on Feavers,’ dated from Tunbridge, 25 July 1704. The treatise on Bath was expanded into ‘A Practical Dissertation on Bath Waters; to which is added a Relation of a very extraordinary Sleeper near Bath,’ 1707, 1719; 5th edit. 1764. This account of the sleeper, Samuel Chilton, a labourer at Timsbury, and twenty-five years old, is also in the ‘Philosophical Transactions,' xxiv. 2177-82, and was issued separately in 1707 and 1719. A further communication by him is in the same ‘Transactions,' xxiv. 1596. His rules for health, written for the use of John Smalley of Plymouth, his cousin, and a discourse of ‘Christian and Politike Reasons’ why England and Holland should not war with each other, with other manuscripts, are in the Sloane NS. No. 1770 at the British Museum, and a letter from him to Sir Hans Sloane is in the same collection, No. 4054.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Courtney, William Prideaux (1895). \"Oliver, William (1659-1716)\".

The agreement was negotiated between January 15 and 26, 2003, in Linas and Marcoussis, France.\n\n\n== Parties ==\nFrench mediators under Pierre Mazeaud at the request of French President Jacques Chirac helped negotiate between several Ivorian political parties. Representatives of the Ivorian Popular Front (PFI), Union for Citizen Democracy (UPCD), Movement for Justice and Peace (MJP), Patriotic Movement of Côte d'Ivoire (MPCI), Ivorian Popular Movement of the Great West (MBIGO), Democratic Party of Ivory Coast – African Democratic Rally (PDCI-RDA), Ivorian Workers' Party (PIT), Rally of the Republicans (RDR), Movement of the Forces of the Future (MFA), and the Union for Democracy and Peace in Ivory Coast (UPDCI) were present. Other mediators included Kéba Mbaye, former Ivorian Prime Minister Seydou Diarra, UN, African Union, and ECOWAS representatives.\n\n\n== Content ==\nThe agreement provided for measures of two different kinds: reforms implemented by Ivorian authorities \"as soon as possible\", and an immediate distribution of powers as delineated in the Constitution. The reforms to be carried out included conditions for presidential eligibility in the Constitution, the application of the December 23, 1988 law regarding rural land, a restructuring of the Armed Forces, the immediate transferral of perpetrators of extrajudicial killings to the International Criminal Court, a revision of the criteria regarding Ivorian citizenship, and new laws implemented to protect foreigners.\nThrough the agreement, the President also lost the right to appoint a Prime Minister, and a new reconciliation council would be created comprising 44 members across all parties, including rebel groups. Rebels from northern Côte d'Ivoire retained control of the Ministry of Defense and Ministry of the Interior, the FPI obtained ten ministries, and the RDR and PDCI each obtained control of seven. The Prime Minister would also be permanently appointed until the next election. The agreements gave the rebels and government an equal share of power.\n\n\n== Implementation ==\nSeydou Diarra was appointed Prime Minister at the end of the agreement, and was later appointed president on March 10. The United Nations authorized ECOWAS and France to deploy troops in Côte d'Ivoire to ensure the implementation of the ceasefire also delineated in the agreement on February 3, and the troops stayed until May 4. On May 13, the United Nations created MINUCI and redeployed French and ECOWAS troops in the country to implement the agreement. The rebels and Ivorian government declared an end to the civil war on July 4.\nOn a legal level, the Linas-Marcoussis agreements laid out a new constitution, although the Constitutional Court could only rule based off the previous constitution, making the new one only de jure applicable.\nIn October 2004, the rebels announced they would not disarm following the rearmament of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Ivory Coast.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Artemon (Ancient Greek: Ἀρτέμων) of Pergamon was a rhetorician of ancient Greece, a grammarian and writer who wrote a history of Sicily, which is now lost. We know of him primarily from his frequent mentions by ancient grammarians, especially the scholiasts on the lyric poet Pindar, about whom Artemon also wrote commentaries.\nHe was said in some works to have been a student of the grammarian and stoic philosopher Crates of Mallus. As with many writers of his name, he is frequently confounded with other authors of his rough time period who produced works in various genres, such as Artemon of Cassandreia.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Schmitz, Leonhard (1870). \"Artemon (8)\".

        "content": "Cyrus Edson (born Albany, New York, September 8, 1857; died New York City, New York, December 2, 1903) was an American pharmacist, medical doctor, and public health official. He was known for his campaigns against adulterated drugs and infectious diseases such as tuberculosis.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nEdson was the son of Franklin Edson (1832–1904), mayor of New York City from 1883 to 1884, and his wife Frances (Wood) Edson (1835–1893). Franklin Edson moved from Albany to New York City when Cyrus was four and went into the produce business there, becoming so successful that by 1873 he was elected president of the New York Produce Exchange.\nCyrus Edson was educated at a military school in Throgg's Neck, attended Columbia University, and graduated from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1881. While at Columbia Edson was part of a Columbia rowing team that won the Visitors' Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta, the first American team to win a race there. The team's ship docked in New York City on August 10, 1878; they were met with a cheering crowd and a parade through the city that led to a reception held at Delmonico's.\n\n\n== Career ==\nEdson served as president of the New York City Board of Pharmacy from 1893 to 1899. From 1882 to 1895 he worked for the New York City Board of Health, rising to serve from 1893 to 1895 as Health Commissioner. He campaigned against adulterated milk, candy, and drugs and also headed the Board of Contagious Diseases, where his efforts against typhus and smallpox attracted much attention.\nAs part of the war of the currents, Edson was recruited by electrical engineer Harold P. Brown to run a second demonstration on August 3, 1888, at Columbia University of the dangers of alternating current by electrocuting stray dogs.\nIn 1896 Edson published a book titled \"Aseptolin: A Formulated Treatment for Tuberculosis, Septicæmia, Malaria and La Grippe, With Reports of Cases\". Edson formed a company to sell this patent medicine.\n\n\n== Writings ==\nEdson wrote dozens of scientific papers and popular articles on medical subjects. He contributed an article on typhoid to Scientific American in 1889. The New York City Board of Health published pamphlets of his on \"Artificial Feeding of Infants\" (1891) and \"La Grippe\" (1893). His 1895 North American Review article \"The Microbe as a Social Leveller\", advancing the idea that public health affects the entire community, continues to be referenced.\nSeveral of his articles promoted typical Victorian views on women and attracted wide attention. An 1892 article in the North American Review titled \"Do We Live Too Fast?\" in which he claimed that \"...this American life of ours is far more wearing on women than on men.\" elicited a response from a prominent surgeon. Another North American Review article, \"On Nagging Women\" elicited a response from Lady Henry Somerset, Harriet Elizabeth Prescott Spofford, and Mary Virginia Terhune.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nEdson married Virginia Churchill Paige (1853–1891); their children were  Helen Augusta Sprague, Franklin Churchill Edson, Florence Edson, Ruth Lennox Renwick, and William Russell Edson. After Virginia's death he remarried to a widow, Mary E. Quick.\nEdson was a friend of soldier and inventor Edmund Zalinski and took an interest in his works; he and Zalinski would reputedly go about with samples of dynamite in their pockets.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Oybek Tursunov (Uzbek: Oybek Botirovich Tursunov) is an Uzbek entrepreneur and government official. Tursunov is married to Saida Mirziyoyeva, the eldest daughter of the current President of Uzbekistan, Shavkat Mirziyoyev. After Mirziyoyev was appointed president in 2017, Tursunov assumed the position of Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration. He is also known to have managed Uzbekistan's national payment system, Uzcard, and was the controlling shareholder of Kapitalbank, one of the largest private banks in the country.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nOybek Tursunov was born into the family of Batyr Tursunov, who served in the KGB during Soviet times. After Uzbekistan's independence, Batyr Tursunov became one of the most influential figures in the country's security apparatus. In the late 1990s, he even led the Main Directorate for Combating Terrorism and Extremism at the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Uzbekistan.\nDuring the presidency of Islam Karimov, the Tursunov family had already played a significant role in the country's political arena. The family solidified its position through the son's marriage to Saida Mirziyoyeva, the eldest daughter of then Prime Minister of Uzbekistan, Shavkat Mirziyoyev. According to the Radio Ozodlik, Oybek Tursunov lived for some time in Moscow, where he represented the national railway company Uzbek Railways. His relocation to Russia might have been caused by a conflict with a criminal group in Tashkent. In 2005, following the Andijan massacre, Batyr Tursunov lost his influence in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, but was later anyway appointed as the head of the Interpol National Central Bureau.\nLike the rest of Shavkat Mirziyoyev's family, Oybek Tursunov first appeared in public on the day of the presidential election in Uzbekistan on 4 December 2016.\n\n\n== Government Service ==\nSoon after the presidential inauguration, Shavkat Mirziyoyev appointed close family members to key positions in the government. Saida Mirziyoyeva became the deputy director of the Agency of Information and Mass Communications under the Presidential Administration. Oybek Tursunov's father, Batyr Tursunov, first became the head of the Uzbekistan National Guard and later, in 2020, assumed the leadership of the State Security Service. Oybek's brother, Ulukbek Tursunov, took up the position of deputy chief of the Tashkent City Police Department (Russian: ГУВД Ташкента).\nOybek Tursunov was appointed the Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration. Sources close to the state apparatus stated that as early as 2017, Tursunov had already been functioning as the principal head of the Presidential Administration. In that year, he was responsible for the construction of a new presidential residence in the settlement of Baytkurgan near Tashkent. For this purpose, dozens of homes along the banks of the Chirchiq river were demolished, while some of the streets were artificially widened. Radio Ozodlik sources reported that the residence was decorated with Argentinian blue marble and Swarovski crystals. Shavkat Mirziyoyev moved into the new residence on the day of his 60th birthday. Based on the leakages from state procurement data, it was established that in 2018, Tursunov held the position of General Director of the Directorate of State Residences of the Presidential Administration Affairs Department (Russian: Дирекция государственных резиденций Управления делами ФХД (Финансово-хозяйственного департамента) администрации президента.)\n\n\n== Business ==\nDespite Tursunov'Kapitalbank’ss low public profile, Radio Ozodlik regards him as one of the most influential businessmen in Uzbekistan. By 2023, following Shavkat Mirziyoyev's ascent to power, Tursunov had founded at least nine companies and had acquired control over valuable real estate in Tashkent and other regions of Uzbekistan. There is evidence that following numerous inspections, Uzbekistan's largest wholesale market, Abu Sahiy, which was previously under the ownership of Timur Tillyaev, son-in-law of Islam Karimov, was acquired by Tursunov and another son-in-law of the current president, Otabek Umarov.\nIn May 2020, Oybek Tursunov acquired a 75% shareholding in the 'Edinyi obshcherespublikanskii protsessingovyi tsentr', which operates the interbank payment system known as Uzcard, with the remaining 25% of the shares being retained by the company itself. Uzcard is the national payment system of Uzbekistan. As of 2019, it serviced about 17 million Uzcard bank cards and provided acquiring services for 29 banks in Uzbekistan and 40 payment aggregators. The deal coincided with the government's decision to transfer pension contributions from the Humo payment system of the Narodny Bank of Uzbekistan to Uzcard cards. However, just a few months later, Tursunov transferred his share to five national banks of Uzbekistan, which soon handed over their Uzcard shares to the State Assets Management Agency (UzSAMA). In October 2022, UzSAMA sold the entire package for 210.1 billion UZS to four individuals. Three of them contributed shares to a new legal entity, IMC-Capital. The sole founder of IMC-Capital is the unknown company \"Berill Holding Company Limited,\" registered in the United Arab Emirates with a charter capital of $1000.\nIn 2019, the company Promadik Invest, in which Tursunov's share constituted 93.4%, purchased 35% of the shares of Kapitalbank. In November 2021, Tursunov increased his stake in the bank's charter capital to 50%. In January 2022, Tursunov sold part of his shares to Telekominvest, a subsidiary of the conglomerate owned by Alisher Usmanov. After that, Tursunov was removed from the Kapitalbank's list of affiliated persons. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Usmanov was placed on the sanction lists of Western countries. In March 2022, he sold his shares in Telekominvest and Finance TCI to long-time associates and former top managers of his holding, Irina Lupicheva and Boris Dobrodeev. Allegedly, at the end of 2022, Tursunov sold bank shares on the stock exchange through the Finance TCI. According to the Central Bank of Uzbekistan, as of February 1, 2023, Kapitalbank was the largest private bank in the country by asset size and the seventh largest among all Uzbekistan banks in terms of assets.\nMedia also reported that Tursunov owns the restaurants Kuranty, Obi Hayot, Truffle, and Nobel, as well as the Shodlik Palace hotel in Tashkent.\n\n\n== Scandals ==\nIn November 2020, Jakhongir Artikkhodjayev, the Mayor of Tashkent, granted a 6-hectare plot of land to the company Urban Developers at no cost. The land was estimated to be worth at least $11.5 million at that time. The company was registered just a month before the deal, while LLP ODORATUS BUSINESS owned 97% of its shares. This entity, through several intermediary companies, belonged to Promadik Invest, whose main shareholder was Oybek Tursunov. The intended development for the land involved tearing down the current retail spaces to build a \"multifunctional shopping and entertainment center.\" As a result, about 100 entrepreneurs filed complaints with the Antimonopoly Committee and the President of Uzbekistan. Urban Developers denied having any connection with Tursunov. In January 2021, the Chilanzar District Court of Tashkent for administrative cases declared the transaction illegal.\nIn 2021, Radio Ozodlik uncovered from the 2018 state procurement records that Oybek Tursunov had acquired a Montblanc desktop accessory set valued at over $6,000 with budget funds.\nIn August 2022, Amanbai Sagidullaev, the leader of the separatist movement Alga Karakalpakstan, alleged that President Mirziyoyev was transferring ownership of factories and industrial plants to his associates. In particular, Oybek Tursunov owns the Kungrad Soda Plant in Elobod through intermediary companies in Arab countries.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOybek Tursunov and Saida Mirziyoyeva are parents to three children: their eldest son Miromon, their daughter Saodat, who is the middle child, and their youngest son Shavkat, who was born in 2020 and named after his grandfather, the president.\nOybek Tursunov is known for having a close relationship with the Crown Prince of Dubai, Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum. In 2019, the prince visited Uzbekistan to participate in a falconry hunt for MacQueen's bustard. The birds, however, are included in the Red Book of Uzbekistan. After the hunt, Tursunov, together with another president's son-in-law, Otabek Umarov, organized a celebratory dinner for the prince. In June 2019, Oybek Tursunov also attended the wedding of the sons of the Emir of Dubai, Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.\nTursunov is also known for his close relationship with the Head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Oybek Tursunov at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "William Piers Ormerod (14 May 1818 – 10 June 1860) was an English anatomist and surgeon.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nOrmerod was born in London 14 May 1818, was the fifth son of George Ormerod of Sedbury Park, Gloucestershire. He was sent to school first at Laleham under the Rev. John Buckland, together with his younger brother, Edward Latham and afterwards (1832) to Rugby, under Arnold, by whom three of his elder brothers had been educated. In 1835 he went to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, where, by the advice of his uncle, Dr. Latham, he was articled as a private pupil to Mr. Stanley, and where he had the advantage of the guiding friendship of Mr. James (afterwards Sir James) Paget. He was a quiet and diligent student, and highly distinguished himself in the school examinations in 1839. In 1840–1 he was house-surgeon to Mr. (afterwards Sir William) Lawrence, and in 1842 gained the Jacksonian prize of the Royal College of Surgeons for an ‘Essay on the Comparative Merits of Mercury and Iodine in the Treatment of Syphilis.’ In 1843 he was appointed demonstrator of anatomy, and in the following year he printed, for the use of the students of the hospital, a collection of ‘Questions in Practical Anatomy,’ 1844. He became a member of the London College of Surgeons in 1843, and afterwards a fellow; he belonged also to the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. But he had been working too hard, and his health began to fail, so that in 1844 he was obliged to leave London and retire for a time to his father's house at Sedbury Park. Here, as soon as his health recovered, he employed himself in arranging the surgical materials that he had collected in the hospital during the nine years 1835–44, and published them, together with the substance of his Jacksonian prize essay, in 1846, with the title, ‘Clinical Collections and Observations in Surgery, made during an Attendance on the Surgical Practice of St. Bartholomew's Hospital.’ The volume is put together with characteristic carefulness and accuracy.\nIn the summer of 1846 Ormerod resumed his professional work at Oxford. He was elected one of the surgeons to the Radcliffe Infirmary, and in 1848 published, under the auspices of the Ashmolean Society, an essay ‘On the Sanatory [sic] condition of Oxford,’ based on the annual reports of the registrar-general for 1844–6, and especially directing attention to the sanitary condition of the different localities in which the deaths from zymotic diseases had occurred. But in December 1848, ‘after a period of great hurry and anxiety,’ he suffered from epileptic fits, and retired from practice altogether. Ill-health was the cause of his ceasing to practise and leaving Oxford in 1849, and eventually (1850) he settled at Canterbury. He died there on 10 June 1860, having fractured the base of his skull from a fall during an epileptic seizure. He was buried in the churchyard of St. Martin's, Canterbury.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Ormerod, William Piers (1895). \"Ormerod, William Piers\".

        "content": "Between November 2019 and June 2020, the bodies of over 180 civilians were discovered in and around the city of Djibo, Burkina Faso. Most of the killings targeted Fulani, and were committed by Burkinabe Armed Forces, Volunteers for the Defense of the Homeland (VDP), and Defense and Security Forces (FDS). Several mass graves were made for the victims in March and April 2020.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSince 2015, northern Burkina Faso has been embroiled in a jihadist insurgency against the al-Qaeda aligned Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin coalition and the homegrown Ansarul Islam. The insurgency intensified and spread to the entirety of the country in 2019, and in response the government stepped up recruiting for the Volunteers for the Defense of the Homeland (VDP), pro-government militias used to combat the insurgents. In August 2019, JNIM and the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) launched an offensive in Liptako-Gourma, the tri-border area between Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger.\nThe city of Djibo in northern Burkina Faso was under Burkinabe and VDP control between 2019 and 2020, although persistent jihadist attacks and a heavy jihadist presence just outside the city limits threatened the security of the city. The city had been blockaded by the jihadists for months. Since many of the Islamist groups recruit from Fulani communities, Burkinabe forces targeted Fulani civilians much heavier.\n\n\n== Massacres ==\nThe massacres took place between November 2019 and June 2020 in and around the city of Djibo. Many of the bodies were Fulani, and suffered signs of torture such as being blindfolded and handcuffed before being shot. The first appearance of bodies by residents of Djibo occurred in November 2019. Residents speaking to Human Rights Watch stated that they began seeing clusters of bodies on the outskirts of the city, mainly on the highways in and out of the town. They also stated that the bodies were not the results of clashes between jihadists and Burkinabe forces, as \"word travels fast, and we'd know if that were the case. Public transport would have stopped, we would have never been able to travel.\"\nSome residents recognized the bodies strewn about in November as family members and acquaintances. The victims had been spotted at various places, including a cattle market, working as a security guard before being arrested by VDP, and other areas of the city. The residents told HRW that all of the victims had been detained by the authorities for questioning regarding possible ties to jihadists, and that many of the victims were IDPs from war-stricken areas.\n\n\n=== Sector 4 massacre ===\nThree groups of bodies were discovered within a one kilometer radius in Djibo's Sector 4 neighborhood in November 2019. Forty-three bodies appeared in the circle; one group had eight victims, one had sixteen, and one had between sixteen and nineteen. One resident stated many of the victims were shirtless and tied up, either by the eyes or hands. They mentioned that they had heard vehicles coming from that area of town and subsequent gunshots. It was also too dark to make out the uniforms of the perpetrators, but it was unlikely to be jihadists as there was little chance of a jihadist truck driving that deep into Djibo that late at night. The interviewee concluded that the victims were all likely prisoners. Another resident corroborated hearing vehicles the night before, along with the victims being tied up. The second interviewee stated that nineteen bodies were discovered in a line the next morning, all of them men except for a 15-year old boy. Another group of five bodies was spotted near the village of Mentao on the outskirts of Djibo, all of whom wearing Fulani clothing. The bodies in Mentao had been there for a week before being discovered. All three groups of victims laid where they were dumped until mid-March 2020, when they were buried.\n\n\n=== Tongomayel massacre ===\nNine men were also discovered in the village of Tongomayel on January 15. A relative of one of the victims stated that his nephew and eight others were arrested at the town's market by Burkinabe forces, and were driven to the Djibo Dam, where gunshots were heard. All of the victims were found face-down and tied, and eight were Fulani and one was Bellah. The bodies were not buried until March.\n\n\n=== Djibo-Tongomayal highway massacre ===\nEighteen bodies were discovered near billboards along the Djibo-Tongomayal highway on March 17, 2020. A relative of a victim stated that his brother was arrested with several others while boarding a bus in Djibo to Ouagadougou. The relative heard gunshots later that night, and went to the location of them the next morning. While they discovered eighteen bodies along the highway, the interviewee's brother was not among them. Six victims, however, had been detained by Defense and Security Forces, a Burkinabe paramilitary prior to their deaths.\n\n\n=== Mbodowol massacre ===\nOn May 14, the bodies of seventeen men were discovered in Djibo's Mbodowol neighborhood after having been arrested by Burkinabe forces the day prior. The body of a mentally disabled man appeared in the same area six days later. A witness to the arrests stated that all seventeen men had come from nearby villages to trade and sell at the Djibo market, and that their bodies were discovered the next day all shot in the head, with bullet casings next to their bodies. All of the men, including the disabled one, were between 25 and 45 years old. Another witness to the arrests stated that only Burkinabe forces would be active during the time the victims were killed.\n\n\n=== Southern Djibo massacre ===\nThe bodies of five men were discovered on June 13, including the chief of Gomde Peulh village. A witness to chief's whereabouts prior to his death stated that they saw Burkinabe soldiers detain the chief and six others and bring them into a building. The six others were eventually let go, but the chief remained detained. Gunshots were heard later that day coming from the area of the building, and five bodies were strewn about the area. All of the bodies were buried on the same day.\n114 bodies of victims were buried between March 8 and 9, 2020, in Djibo. Eighteen men were buried in early April, and forty other bodies were discovered in and around the Djibo Airport in March and May. At least 180 bodies had been discovered in the mass graves, and the majority of them were committed against Fulani by Burkinabe Armed Forces, VDP, and Defence and Security Forces (FDS).\n\n\n== Reactions ==\n\n\n=== Local ===\nBurkinabe activists created a \"Fulani Lives Matter\" campaign in the wake of the massacres. Burkinabe Defence Minister Moumouna Cherif Sy stated that it was hard for security forces to distinguish between jihadists and civilians. Sy also claimed that most of the killings could have been perpetrated by jihadist groups. Burkinabe authorities also promised to investigate the killings and bring justice to the victims.\n\n\n=== International ===\nThe United States stated that the massacres in Djibo could put military aid to Burkina Faso at risk. The United Kingdom and European Union called on Burkinabe authorities to investigate the massacres. Human Rights Watch described the city of Djibo as a \"killing field\" due to the prevalence of the massacres.\n\n\n== External links ==\nBurkina Faso: Residents’ Accounts Point to Mass Executions - Human Rights Watch\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Reginald Orton (27 January 1810–1 September 1862) was a British surgeon.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nOrton was born at Surat, near Bombay, on 27 January 1810. He was the only son of James Orton, surgeon in the East India Company's service and inspector-general of Bombay hospitals, whose father, Reginald Orton, was rector of Hawksworth, near Richmond, Yorkshire. Reginald was educated at the grammar school, Richmond, under James Tate. He afterwards returned to Bombay, where he was bound apprentice to his father. He returned to England on the completion of his apprenticeship, entered at St. Thomas's Hospital as a medical student, and was admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1833, and a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries in the following year.\nIn 1834 he took charge of Mr. Fothergill's practice in Sunderland, purchased it, and in the same year married. He lived in Sunderland until shortly before his death, when he took a farm at Bishopwearmouth. He was surgeon to the Sunderland Eye Infirmary and consulting surgeon to the Seaham Infirmary.\nOrton, although only locally conspicuous in his lifetime, brought about, by his energy, changes which affected the whole empire. Throughout his life he was a busy medical practitioner and an active reformer. Sunderland owes to his initiative its system of lighting by gas, its water-supply, its public baths, its library, and its institute. But his services were not confined to Sunderland. It was owing to his repeated protests, and to the public attention which he drew to the iniquity of taxing light and air, that the chancellor of the exchequer was at last obliged to repeal the duty which for many years had been levied upon glass and windows. Orton suggested to the government that, if light was still to be taxed, the duty should be regulated by the size of the panes, and not by the number of windows, as had hitherto been done; so that the wealthy and those who could afford large sheets of plateglass should pay more than their poorer neighbours. He also advocated the imposition of a moderate house duty, commencing at a certain rental, to make good the loss of revenue, if it was found that the duty could be entirely abolished. The latter scheme was eventually adopted. Orton also took a lively interest in maritime affairs, and turned his attention to the means and appliances for saving life at sea. He projected a new form of reel lifebuoy, and invented a lifeboat which was light, low in the water, open so that the sea passed through it (the crew being encased in waterproof bags), and practically incapable of being capsized; for these he took out a patent in 1845 (No. 10898). The boat was used on one or two occasions. Orton died on 1 September 1862 at Ford North Farm, Bishopwearmouth. He is buried in the cemetery of that town. He wrote no book; the ‘Essay on the Epidemic Cholera of India,’ London, 1831, 8vo, is by his uncle of the same name as himself.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Power, D'Arcy (1895). \"Orton, Reginald\".

        "content": "The economy of the Washington metropolitan area includes the economy of Washington, D.C., and its suburbs, including parts of Maryland, all of Northern Virginia, and Jefferson County, West Virginia. In 2022, the DC metro area had the country's fifth-highest gross metropolitan product, at $541 billion. The region's economy is highly diverse and includes the principal industries of the US federal government, tourism, information technology, research, hospitality, news media, and bioscience.\nKey commercial hubs in the Greater Washington area include Downtown, Washington, D.C., Tysons, Virginia, Rosslyn, Virginia, Crystal City, Virginia, Bethesda, Maryland, and Silver Spring, Maryland.\nAs of 2022, according to Washington's comprehensive annual financial report, the top employers by number of employees in the region in 2022 were Georgetown University, Children's National Medical Center, Washington Hospital Center, George Washington University, American University, Georgetown University Hospital, Booz Allen Hamilton, Insperity PEO Services, Universal Protection Service, Howard University, Medstar Medical Group, George Washington University Hospital, Catholic University of America, and Sibley Memorial Hospital.\n\n\n== Federal government ==\n\nAs the national capital of the United States, the country's federal government is headquartered in the city, and is therefore a major employer and important economic engine for the broader region. As of July 2022, 25% of people employed in Washington, D.C., were federal government employees. Important federal government agencies and departments are also located in suburban Washington. The Pentagon, which houses the US Department of Defense, is headquartered in Arlington County, Virginia, and the CIA is headquartered in the Langley area of Fairfax County, Virginia. The FBI is planning on moving its headquarters from Downtown Washington to Prince George's County, Maryland.\nIn addition to people employed directly by the federal government, the region also has many people employed in organizations whose work relies directly on funding from or contracting with the federal government, or in some other way interacts directly with the government. Many lobbying organizations seek to influence US government policy. Similarly, the region has a high concentration of law firms headquartered in the area or with major offices in the region that work with the federal government as well as with other institutions and industries. Historically, K Street was where many of the city's lobbying organizations were located, and is therefore sometimes used as a metonym for lobbying of the US federal government. Among the key lobbying and law firms include Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, and Holland & Knight. \nIn addition to important law firms and lobbying organizations, many other organizations rely on the federal government for employment as a result of receiving funding directly from the government or using their work with the government to encourage private donors to support their mission. These include defense contractors, civilian contractors, nonprofit organizations, trade unions, industry trade groups, and professional associations, many of which have their headquarters in the Washington area so they can be close to the federal government. \nAs of February 2022, the largest U.S. government agencies located in the Washington Metropolitan Area are: the United States Department of Defense headquartered in the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, the United States Postal Service, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, the United States Department of Homeland Security, and the United States Department of Justice.\n\n\n== Defense, aviation, and aerospace ==\n\nThe US federal government's demand for military technology has led to the growth of a large defense sector in the region. As a result, many key defense contractors are headquartered in the Washington area. The world's five largest weapons manufacturers are all headquartered in the region: Lockheed Martin is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland; RTX Corporation is headquartered in Rosslyn, Virginia; Northrop Grumman is headquartered in West Falls Church, Virginia; Boeing, which specializes in commercial aircraft in addition to military technology, is headquartered in Crystal City; and General Dynamics is headquartered in Reston, Virginia.\nOther important aviation and aerospace organizations headquartered in the broader Washington region include NASA, the US government's space research organization, which is headquartered in DC. Additionally, Airbus, which specializes in both commercial aviation and military technology, has its North American branch, known as Airbus Group, Inc., headquartered in Fairfax County, Virginia. Blue Origin has major offices in Reston, Virginia and SpaceX has an office in DC.\n\n\n== Diplomacy and global finance ==\n\n\n=== Diplomacy ===\nWashington is home to 185 foreign embassies, where many diplomats and ambassadors work. Key diplomatic meetings occur at embassies, as do important cultural activities and performances. DC is consequently one of the most culturally diverse cities in the world and hosts a number of internationally themed festivals and events, many of which are done in close collaboration with foreign embassies. \n\n\n=== Global finance ===\n\nIn addition to foreign diplomatic missions, the city holds an important role in global finance and international economics. The Federal Reserve (\"The Fed\"), located along Constitution Avenue, is the United States' central bank. By conducting monetary policy, the members of the Federal Reserve Board impact the value of the US dollar, key interest rates, and the value of currencies around the world. \nThe World Bank and International Monetary Fund (both located in the Golden Triangle) are key global financial and development institutions whose policies have a dramatic affect on the wealth and development of countries across the world. They use loans and grants to influence foreign countries' level of economic development and financial stability. Due to the heavy importance the city holds in global finance, in 2023 the Global Financial Centres Index ranked DC as the 8th most competitive financial center in the world.\n\n\n=== International development ===\nKey development institutions headquartered in the city include the Inter-American Development Bank and USAID, the US agency charged with leading the government's international development portfolio. As a result of this rich concentration of finance and development expertise as well as organizations that finance global development, the Washington region is the global center for the international development sector, serving as the home for key firms, such as Chemonics International.\n\n\n== Research and professional services ==\nWashington is a leading center for both national and international research organizations. Among the most notable research institutions in the Washington area is the Smithsonian Institution, which controls many of the region's museums while conducting advanced research on a number of subjects, including art history, natural history, zoology, and space. Three of the institution's research centers are located in the Washington region: the Archives of American Art and Smithsonian Libraries and Archives are both located in DC while the Museum Conservation Institute is in Prince George's County, Maryland. \nOther organizations key to research on a number of subjects include the Library of Congress and the National Archives. The Folger Shakespeare Library, located in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, is the world's largest research library focused on Shakespeare and early English-language texts.\n\n\n=== Think tanks ===\n\nThe city is known for having a heavy concentration of think tanks engaged in public policy research, writing, and thinking. As of 2020, 8% of the country's think tanks were headquartered in the city, including many of the largest and most widely cited; these include the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Center for Strategic and International Studies, Brookings Institution, Atlantic Council, Peterson Institute for International Economics, Heritage Foundation, US Institute of Peace, and Urban Institute. \n\n\n=== Medical research ===\nDC is also home to important medical and health research organizations. For example, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland. Other such organizations include the Children's National Hospital, MedStar Washington Hospital Center, the National Foundation for Cancer Research, and the Foundation for Biomedical Research. \n\n\n=== Political and economic risk firms ===\nIn addition to NGOs, the city is home to many for-profit political, geopolitical, and economic risk consultancy organizations. Among these are the Albright Stonebridge Group, McLarty Associates, and major offices for Eurasia Group.\n\n\n=== Professional services ===\nThe Big 4 professional services consultancy firms (Deloitte, EY, PwC, and KPMG) all have major offices spread throughout the Washington region.\n\n\n== Humanitarianism ==\n\nDC is a global center for human rights and humanitarian non-profit organizations. There are over 500 humanitarian organizations located in the Greater Washington area. These organizations address both domestic and global issues by doing research, running aid programs, and conducting public advocacy.

The roots of IT in the Washington metropolitan area date back to the founding of the modern internet. America Online (AOL), which invented the internet as it currently exists, was headquartered in Sterling, Virginia during its peak in the 1990s. As a result, much of the infrastructure, financial capital, and human capital needed in the IT sector remains concentrated in the region. \nThe Dulles Technology Corridor in Northern Virginia, which extends from Dulles International Airport on the west through Alexandria, Virginia on the east, contains a large concentration of tech company headquarters and key satellite offices. Among the companies with offices along this corridor include Google, Amazon Web Services, IBM, Blue Origin, and Leidos, which is headquartered in Reston, Virginia. Additionally, Amazon's headquarters is located in the National Landing area of Arlington County, Virginia. The company chose Northern Virginia to be the location of its second headquarters (to support its original headquarters in Seattle), due in part to the proximity of tech knowledge and talent in the area. Tapping into this knowledge hub, Virginia Tech, a university whose main campus is in Blacksburg, Virginia in the southwestern part of the state, is opening a $1 billion \"innovation campus\" in Potomac Yard, Alexandria, where the university will focus on teaching technology classes and conducting tech research.\nMany technology and finance companies are headquartered in Tysons, Virginia, a key commercial and shopping area in Fairfax County, Virginia. As the central business district of Fairfax and a growing mixed-used area, Tysons is an edge city of Washington, DC. \nAmong the companies headquartered in Tysons include Alarm.com, Appian Corporation, Booz Allen Hamilton, MITRE Corporation, M.C. Dean, Inc., Cvent, Freddie Mac, Exelis, MicroStrategy, Logistics Management Institute, Primus Telecom, SAIC, Space Adventures, and Spacenet. Other tech firms with offices in Tysons include Adobe Systems, BAE Systems Inc., Compuware, DXC Technology, Palantir Technologies, Deloitte, Ernst & Young, Northrop Grumman, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Xerox, and Vie de France.\n\n\n=== Financial services ===\n\nCapital One, a bank holding company, has its global headquarters in Tysons, Virginia. The sprawling Capital One complex has multiple office buildings as well as Capital One Hall, a performing arts venue built and run by Capital One. Other key financial players headquartered in the area include Fannie Mae (headquartered in DC and with major offices in Reston, Virginia) and Freddie Mac (headquartered in Tysons). \nOther important financial organizations headquartered in the Washington area include the Carlyle Group (Washington, DC), which is a private equity investment firm, PenFed Credit Union (Tysons), and Navy Federal Credit Union (Vienna, Virginia). Geico, a car insurance company, is headquartered in Chevy Chase, Maryland, just north of the Maryland-DC border.\n\n\n== Hospitality ==\n\nThe Washington area has a large concentration of hotels, making it an economically important region for the hospitality industry. Historic hotels located in the city include Georgetown Inn, Hamilton Hotel, Omni Shoreham Hotel, Riggs Hotel, Mayflower Hotel, and the Willard Hotel.\nThe DC region also serves as the headquarters for key hotel companies. Two of the world's largest hotel chains are headquartered in the DC area. Marriott International, the largest hotel chain in the world, is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland. Hilton Worldwide, also one of the world's largest hotel chains, is headquartered in Tysons, Virginia.\n\n\n== Consumer goods ==\nA number of companies producing popular consumer goods are headquartered throughout the Washington region. Mars Inc., a manufacturer of sugary treats as well as pet food, is headquartered in Tysons, Virginia. Mars is the maker of popular treats, such as M&M's, Snickers, and Twix. Nestlé, which manufactures a number of different foods and drinks, has its US headquarters at 1812 North Moore Street in Rosslyn, Virginia. Volkswagen, a car design and manufacturing company, has its North America headquarters in Reston, Virginia.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nTourism is among the DC region's largest and most important industries. In 2019, the city attracted 24.6 million tourists, including 1.8 million from foreign countries. Collectively, tourists spent $8.15 billion during their stay. \nThe city and wider Washington region has a diverse array of attractions for tourists. Among these are monuments, memorials, museums, sports events, and national parks. Within the city, the National Mall serves as the center of the tourism industry and the location of many of the city's museums and monuments. Just south of the Mall sits the Tidal Basin, where several additional memorials and monuments lie, including the popular Jefferson Memorial. \nArlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia is among the region's most visited tourist sites. This is a military cemetery that serves as a burial ground for former military combatants. It is also the location of President John F. Kennedy's tomb, marked by an eternal flame. President William Howard Taft is also buried in Arlington. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is located in the cemetery and is guarded 24/7 by a tomb guard. The changing of the guard is a popular tourist attraction and occurs once every hour from October through March and every half-hour during the rest of the year. Other key tourist attractions include The Pentagon, the 9/11 Pentagon Memorial, the United States Air Force Memorial, Old Town Alexandria, National Harbor, and Mount Vernon, the former home of George Washington.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nWashington, D.C., is a global center for media.

        "content": "Artemon (Ancient Greek: Ἀρτέμων) of Miletus was a relatively well-known writer of ancient Greece on the interpretation of dreams and on incubation cures. He lived around the middle of the first century CE, and was said to have written during the reign of the Roman emperor Nero.\nHe is most well known for his work the Oneirocritica (ὀνειροκριτικά), in twenty-two books, which is now lost. This work was said to have been one of the works relied upon by the later writer Artemidorus, to compile his own book titled Oneirocritica. Artemon's method of compiling the dreams for his collection was to record accounts of allegedly fulfilled dreams, often or exclusively by people sleeping in sacred spaces. Artemon's work differed from that of Artemidorus in that Artemon had greater emphasis on dreams more about the recent past than the future, and the syncretic deity Serapis (a then-popular miracle cult) figured more prominently as a presence.\nHe may have had a son named Neon, owing to a surviving temple inscription at Miletus, dating from the time of the emperor Caligula, describing \"Neon, son of Artemon of Miletus, Friend of Gaius\" that may refer to this Artemon, or to another of this name.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Schmitz, Leonhard (1870). \"Artemon (7)\".

        "content": "Thomas Morison (1558?–1603?) was a Scottish physician and diplomat.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMorison was born about 1558 it is said, in Aberdeen, but the statement is only based on the epithet 'Aberdonanus' or 'Aberdonnus' which Morison applies to himself. He may have been educated at Aberdeen, and Tanner calls him 'medicinæ doctor in academia Aberdonensi,' but his name does not appear in the published records. Like many of his countrymen (cf. Preface to Fasti Aberdonenses, Spalding Club), Morison studied at Montpellier, whence he probably took his degree of M.D. It was possibly during Anthony Bacon's visit to Montpellier in 1582 that Morison made his acquaintance. Morison was probably at Arras in December 1592, for in a letter to Bacon he gives a remarkably minute account of the death of Alexander Farnese, which occurred there on 2 December. From that date until Bacon's death in 1601 Morison seems to have frequently corresponded with him, but few of his letters are preserved (Birch, Memoirs of the Reign of Queen Elizabeth, i. 99). Early in 1593 Morison appears to have been at Frankfort, where he published his first book, 'Liber novus de Metallorum causis et Transubstantione,' 1593, 8vo (Brit. Mus.); it is dedicated to James VI, and directed against alchemists and astrologers. In the same year Morison returned to Scotland, and through Bacon's influence became one of Essex's 'earliest, as well as most considerable, intelligencers there' (Birch). During a visit to the north of Scotland he fell in with the Earl of Huntly, and secured considerable influence with him, which Morison thought might be of use to the queen's envoys. Elizabeth appears to have been quite satisfied with Morison's services, which were well rewarded with money. In August 1593 he received 30l from Bacon; Essex sent him a hundred crowns in September, and another hundred in March 1593–4. On 5 Feb. 1593-4 Morison dedicated to James his second book, 'Papatus, seu depravatæ religionis Origo et Incrementum,' Edinb. 1594, 8vo (Brit. Mus.) In spite of its fanciful alphabetical arrangement, it is a learned work, compiled from more than two hundred authors, and tracing the history of the papacy from its origin to the Reformation. It is quoted in Ussher's 'Historia Dogmatica,' p. 271, and 'is now of rare occurrence, and highly prized by the learned for its singular erudition.'\nIn 1594 Morison appears to have visited London and had an interview with Essex. Next year he was back again in Scotland sending accounts to his patron of James's behaviour and views on domestic and foreign policy, and describing the movements of Huntly, Erroll, Angus, and a Jesuit, John Morton, who had been Morison's schoolfellow (Birch, i. 224). After Anthony's death, in 1601, Francis Bacon seems to have maintained a correspondence with Morison. In 1603 he wrote soliciting Morison's interest with James, who was then about to take possession of his English crown. Probably Morison's death occurred soon after. Dempster dates it 1601, but this is obviously a mistake.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Pollard, Albert Frederick (1894). \"Morison, Thomas\".

        "content": "The Black Elfstone is a fantasy novel by Terry Brooks in his Shannara series. It is the first book in The Fall of Shannara series, first published in 2017.\n\n\n== Plot summary ==\nThe novel begins with a stranger hiring a man called Tigueron to assassinate the druid Drisker Arc, former High Druid of Paranor. We are then introduced to Tavo Kaynin, who reminisces about growing up with his sister and discovering the Wishsong magic they have. Tarsha has control of hers. Tavo's is more chaotic, and he destroys things with it when he loses his temper. After being implicated in the disappearance of a neighborhood bully, Tavo is sent to live with his uncle and warned not to use is magic. Two years later, Tarsha visits Tavo against her parents’ will. Tavo is living in a shed like an animal, something her uncle defends because Tavo is dangerous. Tavo sends her away. Tarsha determines to seek training from the druids, then return to help Tavo.\nMeanwhile, Tavo murders his uncle, parents, and several others, tearing them apart with an explosive, and deadly form of Wishsong. He then sets out to find his sister Tarsha and murder her for abandoning him. Along the way he stops in a tavern and is hassled by some of the patrons. He murders everyone in the tavern. Tavo continues on his journey, haunted by those he has killed and Fluken, an evil imaginary friend, or possibly a split personality that encourages Tavo to do his worst.\nIn the north, an Army of Trolls is defeated by a mysterious army of soldiers that are able to disappear, allowing them to easily defeating the mighty troll army. The Druid council learns of this and the High Druid, Ober Balronen, sends druids Zia and Ruis to investigate. He sends the Druid High Blade, Darcon (Dar) Leah along as well, and asks that he report Zia and Ruis’ doings back to him. As they travel north, Zia reveals that she is no longer with Ruis, and that she loved Dar. Dar wonders if he still has feelings for Zia. They see the mysterious army, and Ruis demands to investigate on the ground alone despite Dar's warnings. While on the ground they are attacked by the mysterious enemy and Ruis is executed. The survivors flee into the mountains aboard their airship. The enemy pursues them and destroys their airship. Everyone dies except Dar, who leaps from the ship to a cliff face and climbs down to safety. A mysterious white cloaked enemy sees him on the cliff face and can easily kill him, but after a tense standoff, lets Dar go.\nTarsha seeks out Drisker Arc near the town of Emberen, and after a display of her abilities, he agrees to train her. Her training is interrupted when Drisker is called away to help the Trolls. While he is away, assassins attack Drisker's cottage. Tarsha escapes with Drisker's two heavy volumes of spells and conjurings. A forest imp called Flinc helps her escape. When Drisker returns to find his cottage burned, Flinc tells him that Tarsha was killed. He quickly recants, and Drisker finds her drugged in the imp's home. Flinc had wanted to keep her. The assassins attack again, and Drisker kills several of them. He recognizes them as Orsis Guild and decides to seek them out. In the city of Varfleet a street orphan called Shea Ohmsford leads Drisker and Tarsha to the Orsis Guild where they find Tigueron. Tigueron describes the person that hired them to assassinate him and then Drisker breaks his neck.\nA young man called Kassen Drue applies to train with the druids. He demonstrates an ability to disappear, and project an illusion of himself. He seduces a young Druid-in-Training called Allis, and she shows him the secret entrance into Paranor.\nDar returns to Paranor, reports what happened and suggests asking the Elves for help. Balronen is incensed and not only ignores that idea but banishes and exiles Dar from Paranor for his failure. On his way out he sees Allis and Kassen. A druid called Clizia Porse gives him his Sword of Leah and urges that he leave before it's too late and seek Drisker Arc.\nDrisker and Tarsha go to Paranor, but the High Druid refuses to speak with them. Clizia Porse brings him up to speed on what has transpired, and gives him a scrye orb, with which Drisker can contact her. Drisker describes the man who hired his assassin, but she claims not to know of whom he speaks. Drisker and Tarsha then return to Emberen. Dar meets them at Driskers cottage. Drisker describes the man who hired his assassin to Dar and Dar tells him it sounds like Kassen Drue, a man with the power to disappear like the soldiers of the mysterious army in the north, who was recently admitted as a Druid-in-Training by Clizia Porse. Alarmed by this revelation, Drisker and Dar head back to Paranor. Tarsha strikes off on her own to find her brother. At a tavern, she is joined by a mysterious seer called Parlindru who predicts that three times she will love, three times she will die, and three times she will make a difference.\nBack at Paranor Kassen murders Allis. Drisker asks Clizia Porse why she lied about knowing Kassen, but then Paranor is invaded by disappearing soldiers. Clizia convinces Drisker to help her retrieve the Black Elfstone and send Paranor into limbo. He doesn't trust her but agrees to this to protect Paranor. Dar leaves Drisker to fight the invaders that are inside Paranor slaughtering the druids. He attacks Kassen, but he disappears and escapes. Drisker retrieves the Black Elfstone, and then Clizia Porse scratches him with a poison that leaves him paralyzed. Drisker releases the Guardian from the Druid's Well which begins slaughtering the invaders with a deadly green mist. Clizia Porse and Dar escape from Paranor, and Clizia uses the Black Elfstone to send Paranor into limbo disappearing it from the Four Lands, then leaves Dar behind. Dar finds the leader of the invasion who turns out to be a young woman. The novel closes as Drisker realizes the Guardian has spared him but that he is trapped in limbo inside Paranor.\n\n\n== Characters ==\nThe characters are:\n\nAllis Errencarthyjorian is a young Druid-in-Training.\nChu Frenk is a dwarf druid, and sycophantic member of the High Druid's council.\nClizia Porse is a druid of Paranor.\nCrace Adris is a druid historian.\nDarcon (Dar) Leah is the High Druid's Blade, the commander of the guard at Paranor.\nFade is giant moor cat.\nFlinc is a forest Imp, in love with Tarsha.\nFluken is Tavo's evil, imaginary friend, possibly his split personality.\nKassen Drue is a new Druid-in-Training.\nOber Balronen is the Ard Rhys, High Druid of Paranor.\nParanor is the Druid Keep.\nParfend is the leader, or Maturen of the Corrax Trolls.\nParlindru is a mysterious seer.\nPrax Tolt is a leader of warrior druids.\nRuis Quince is a druid of Paranor, and Zia's lover.\nTarsha Kaynin is sister to Tavo, Wishsong wielder and student of Drisker Arc.\nTavo Kaynin is a madman in possession of a lethal form of Wishsong.\nTigueron is the leader of the Orsis Guild, a band of assassins.\nZia Amarodian is a half-Elf druid; former friend and lover to Dar Leah.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nPublishers Weekly wrote that \"the first volume of Brooks's quartet, which will bring this decades-old Shannara epic fantasy saga to a close, works best for readers at opposite poles: series devotees” familiar with the backstory, “and newcomers” alike.\nAidan Moher of Reactor writes that although Brooks has planned The Fall of Shannara to be the conclusion to the Shannara series, he may \"write more Shannara novels, just not ones that move the story forward chronologically.\" Moher praises The Black Elfstone as \"a vintage Shannara novel\" that \"proves that 40 years later, [Brook’s has] still got it. It has epic scope, heroic characters, and so much heart.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n[ The Black Elfstone by Terry Brooks: 9780553391503 | PenguinRandomHouse.com: Books |The Black Elfstone by Terry Brooks] – official webpage for the Del Rey eBook.\nTerry Brooks Official Website",

        "revision_id": 1216296832,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Goose Gap is the 19th American Viticultural Area (AVA) in Washington, United States. It encompasses the local region surrounding Goose Mountain in Benton County between Kiona to the west, and Richland along the Columbia River to the east. The viticultural area was formally established on August 2, 2021, by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), Treasury after reviewing the petition submitted by geologist/vintner, Alan Busacca, on behalf of the Goose Gap Wine Grower's Association, proposing the viticultural area \"Goose Gap\". The area is a sub-appellation entirely within the Yakima Valley and the expansive Columbia Valley AVAs sandwiched on a northwest–southeast axis between neighboring viticultural areas Red Mountain and the minute Candy Mountain.\"Goose Gap\" refers to a saddle between Goose Mountain to the west and Badger and Candy Mountains to the east within the vast Columbia Valley. Both geographies are within its appellation boundaries which are named for being a common pathway for migratory waterfowl. In 1998, the first grapevines were planted in the area by Arvid Monson. Within the approximately 8,129 acres (13 sq mi) AVA, there are two commercial vineyards cultivating 1,800 acres (728 ha) and only one winery. The primary varietals produced are Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Merlot and Syrah.\n\n\n== Terroir ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nThe distinguishing features of the Goose Gap AVA are its geology and soils. The appellation is part of a series of folded hills and valleys collectively known as the Yakima Fold Belt, a series of topographical folds (or wrinkles) raised from tectonic compression, which runs from the Beezley Hills in the north to the Horse Heaven Hills in the south. Goose Gap AVA comprises two geographic features with similar viticultural conditions: Goose Gap and the adjoining Goose Hill. Goose Gap and Goose Hill together form part of a single folded and faulted block of the Columbia River Basalt. Sometime between 10 and 15 million years ago, multiple lava flows poured out from the Yellowstone hotspot, then located in western Idaho. These lava flows covered large portions of Washington and Oregon on their way to the Pacific Ocean and are the cause of the underlying basalt of the region. In some areas, the basalt was 5,900 feet (1,800 m) thick.Goose Gap is formed from a syncline, a down-folded arch in the bedrock that creates a saddle-like shape, whereas Goose Hill is formed from an anticline, an arch-like structure of basalt that bends upwards to form a ridge and slopes. Elevations range from 577 feet (176 m) above sea level along the southern boundary to 1,339 feet (408 m) at the top of Goose Mountain. Goose Gap and Goose Hill both have an east–west orientation, south and southwest slopes that are too steep for planting, and plantable north and northeast slopes. In contrast, the petition states that all of the ridges and hills in the region surrounding the AVA have a northwest–southeast orientation, plantable south and southwest slopes, and north and northeast slopes that are too steep for vineyards. Because vineyards in the Goose Gap AVA are planted on north-and northeast-facing slopes, they receive less solar radiation than nearby vineyards planted on south and southwest-facing slopes. As a result, grapes grown in the AVA typically ripen later than the same varietals grown in the neighboring Red Mountain to the northwest.\n\n\n=== Soil ===\nFive main soil series make up almost 95 percent of the soils in the Goose Gap: Warden, Shano, Kiona, Hezel, and Prosser. The Warden series soils, which make up 65 percent of the AVA, consist of wind-blown loess over layered or stratified silts and fine sands, and have rooting depths of 6 feet (2 m) or more with no hardpans or other root-restrictive layers. Shano soils constitute seven percent of the Goose Gap and are also formed from wind-blown loess and are deep soils with low levels of organic material. Kiona soils make up 9 percent of the AVA and are formed in loess and rubble from fractured basalt. Hezel soils make up seven percent of the AVA and are made of windblown sand over stratified silts and sands. Finally, Prosser soils make up five percent and derive from loess mixed with flood sediments. Prosser soils are generally shallow and overlay fractured basalt bedrock. In comparison, Warden soils are less common in the established Red Mountain AVA to the northwest, the Horse Heaven Hills AVA to the southwest, and in the established Yakima Valley AVA that encompasses Goose Gap. Additionally, Scooteney soils make up almost 11 percent of soils in the established Red Mountain AVA, and Ritzville soils make up almost 30 percent of the soils in the established Horse Heaven Hills AVA, yet both soil series are completely absent from Goose Gap AVA.Finally, TTB has also determined that the Goose Gap will remain part of the established Yakima Valley AVA. The two AVAs share soils that are a combination of glacial-flood and windborne soils, including the Warden soil series, and rest on Columbia River basalt. However, Goose Gap is unique among the hills of the Yakima Valley AVA in that it has an east–west alignment and plantable north and northeast slopes. Additionally, a major soil series of the Yakima Valley AVA is the Scooteney-Starbuck soil association. However, within the Goose Gap AVA, Scooteney soils are absent, and Starbuck soils make up less than 2 percent of the soils.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe area shares the unusual terroirs in the state with neighboring Red and Candy Mountain AVAs where southwest facing slopes experience warmer temperatures and more sunlight hours than any other part of the Columbia Valley. The nighttime temperatures drop considerably, helping to preserve the acid levels within the grape At Benton City, the Yakima River flows past the area and provides a moderating effect on the temperature. Cool air from the northern elevations flowing to the lower river valley moves across the hillside vineyards and keeps the grapes from being overheated. This constant air movement prevents air settling and frost damage to the grapes \nThe area has a desert climate with average annual rainfall of 6 inches (150 mm). During the growing season, daytime temperatures average 90 °F (32 °C) with nighttime temperatures dropping below 50 °F (10 °C). Vineyards rely on irrigation to supply water to the vines allowing viniters to optimize the growth cycle of their grapevines.\n\n\n== Industry ==\nIn 1998, Yakima native, renown grower, rancher and founder of Goose Ridge Winery, Arvid Monson, chose to plant grapes on the hills adjacent to Red Mountain with the consultation of Dr. Walter Clore, who is considered by many to be the \"father\" of the Washington wine industry. \"Our family started farming in the Columbia Valley in the early 1900s and we always knew Goose Gap was a special site\", said Bill Monson, President of Goose Ridge Estate Vineyards & Winery, which is currently the only winery within Goose Gap AVA. Dr. Clore noted Goose Gap's gradual, south-facing slopes and warm temperatures as excellent viticulture terroir. The Goose Ridge Estate Vineyard & Winery is the largest vineyard development in the lower Yakima Valley to be planted dominantly on Goose Gap's north and northeast slopes capitalizing on the unique and diverse qualities of the locale. TTB confirmed Dr. Clore's observations when it recognized the geology, soils, elevation, and slope direction as clearly unique to this region and established Goose Gap AVA. Goose Ridge Estate Vineyard & Winery produces quality vintages from the 16 varieties grown in the AVA highlighting Goose Gap in their portfolio of wines and spirits.The establishment of the Goose Gap AVA allows vintners to use \"Goose Gap\", \"Yakima Valley\", and \"Columbia Valley\" as appellations of origin for wines made primarily from grapes grown within Goose Gap if the wines meet the eligibility requirements for the appellation.\nTo qualify as an AVA, a wine grape-growing region must be distinguishable by features such as climate, soil, elevation and physical features. Since August 2, 2021, wineries may submit a Certificate of Label Approval (COLA) request to the TTB for a label using Goose Gap AVA as the appellation of origin. \"Each AVA is several years in the making, so this is an exciting time for those who make wine from grapes grown within Goose Gap\", said Steve Warner, President of the Washington State Wine Commission, \"We're ready to start spreading the word about this great region!\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGoose Gap AVA – Washington State Wine Commission\nGoose Ridge Estate Winery\nTTB AVA Map",

        "content": "The Paraíba Valley was the stage of military deployments by opposing forces during the 1964 Brazilian coup d'état: the rebel 2nd Army, coming from São Paulo towards Rio de Janeiro along the Via Dutra highway, and the loyalist School-Unit Group (Grupamento de Unidades-Escola; GUEs), coming from Rio de Janeiro in the opposite direction. The 2nd Army was commanded by General Amaury Kruel, in rebellion against the government of president João Goulart. The GUEs, led by Anfrísio da Rocha Lima, was subordinated to General Armando de Morais Âncora, from the 1st Army. Such movements were in progress or preparation in the early hours of 1 April, although the loyalist 2nd Army General Euryale de Jesus Zerbini delayed his army's movement. The Military Academy of Agulhas Negras (Academia Militar das Agulhas Negras; AMAN), led by General Emílio Garrastazu Médici, and the 1st Armored Infantry Battalion (1º Batalhão de Infantaria Blindado; 1º BIB), were halfway the road, respectively in the municipalities of Resende and Barra Mansa. Médici, forced to choose a side, joined the coup. The 1st BIB did the same.\nIn the morning, before the arrival of the 2nd Army and the GUEs, Médici occupied Resende and used his cadets to establish defensive positions along Via Dutra, towards Barra Mansa, from where he could resist the loyalists. The forces from São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro arrived around noon, with the former remaining further back, in Resende and Itatiaia, and the latter around Barra Mansa, with the academy's force in the middle, facing the loyalists. Combat, if it occurred, would begin between the cadets and GUEs soldiers. The loyalists were elite troops, with superior numbers and weaponry. The use of cadets on the front line also had a bad record in other countries. What Médici had in his favor was the effect of a \"psychological brake\" on the loyalist officers, who were unwilling to attack. Of the three artillery batteries sent against the academy, two immediately crossed the lines and defected to the rebels.\nNo confrontation occurred, as in the afternoon operations were interrupted by the arrival of generals Kruel and Âncora to negotiate within the academy. The defense mounted by Médici is considered important in forcing Âncora to negotiate, but it was part of a larger context of deterioration in the government's position. The resulting meeting \"would once and for all mark the History of Brazil\": the end of the 1st Army's resistance to the coup and the return of the troops to their barracks. Médici's reputation among the military grew, and his decision became part of the Army's collective memory.\nThe 1st BIB did not participate in the meeting of the military forces, as it was in Volta Redonda, where trade unionists, who opposed to the coup, unsuccessfully tried to paralyze the Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional, revealing themselves to be less organized than the military and industrial leaders.\n\n\n== Military background ==\nIn a meeting with his generals around midnight on 31 March, Amaury Kruel sided his 2nd Army with the coup and ordered the invasion of Rio de Janeiro. At this time, the Tiradentes Detachment, a unit sent on campaign by general Olímpio Mourão Filho, had already crossed the border between Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro and come into contact with the loyalist forces sent from Guanabara and Petrópolis to confront it. By noon on 1 April, the detachment had advanced to the Areal region, facing the 2nd Infantry Regiment (2º Regimento de Infantaria; 2º RI). Meanwhile, the School-Unit Group (GUEs) would form the loyalist reaction to the 2nd Army.\nOutside the Rio-São Paulo-Minas Gerais axis, São Paulo's western flank was Mato Grosso, whose 9th Military Region (9ª Região Militar; 9ª RM) was subordinate and loyal to the 2nd Army. The 16th Battalion of Caçadores, in Cuiabá, was ordered to advance to Brasília. The other flank was the southern region of Brazil, where the situation had not yet been decided until 2 April. The 5th Military Region, in Paraná and Santa Catarina, joined the coup, but not the entirety of the 3rd Army. Thus, on that day the 2nd Army sent reinforcements to the 5th Military Region, but the crisis ended before they were needed.\n\n\n== Beginning of the deployments ==\n\n\n=== General Zerbini and loyalist reinforcements ===\n\nThe \"military apparatus\" of João Goulart's government, that is, the group of officers considered loyal and appointed to important positions, had as one of its most important figures in São Paulo the brigade general Euryale de Jesus Zerbini, commander of the Divisional Infantry of the 2nd Infantry Division (2nd DI). Zerbini did not attend the meeting of generals in São Paulo; having arrived in the city from 18:30 to 19:00, he was called by his superior and commander of the 2nd Infantry Division, Aluísio Miranda Mendes, before entering the HQ. Both sided with the government, with Aluísio promising to arrest Kruel if he rebelled. Zerbini was tasked with commanding the forces in the Paraíba Valley, a possible São Paulo–Rio invasion route through the Via Dutra highway. The local garrison consisted of the 5th and 6th Infantry Regiments (RIs) and the 2nd Combat Engineering Battalion (2nd BE Cmb). Zerbini was to be ready to move them.\nAt 21:00, Zerbini arrived at his headquarters in Caçapava, confirmed the loyalty of his subordinates and sent them in the direction of the rebels in Minas Gerais: the 5th RI of Lorena would take up positions in the direction of Itajubá, where the 4th BE Cmb from Minas Gerais was located, and in the Mantiqueira Tunnel, while the 6th RI from Caçapava would advance to the Paraíba do Sul river bridge in Jacareí and Campos do Jordão, on the way to Minas Gerais. Reconnaissance teams observed nothing unusual in these places and the regiments remained on standby in their barracks. But as the situation changed, at 22:30 Zerbini refused Aluísio's call to São Paulo. Contacted by general Assis Brasil and the president himself at 23:00 and 23:30, Zerbini said he was loyal and in control, but unable to resist an advance by the rest of the 2nd Army, and was then informed he'd be reinforced by tanks and general Anfrísio da Rocha Lima's GUEs.\nThe School-Unit Group's artillery component was the Artillery School-Group (GEsA). Each day a battery was on standby, and on the 31st it was 1st Lieutenant Hamilton Otero Sanches' 2nd Battery. According to his testimony, his group lived a moment of tension, and subordinates were uninformed and heard nothing from superiors. At night, a call to the group ordered an entire battery to follow the Infantry School-Regiment (REsI). He obeyed, but only to follow orders, as his political position was against \"so much anarchy in our country\". At the suggestion of one of his staff officers, Captain Sílvio Pereira Brunner, he first consulted his commander. That was loyalist Colonel Aldo Pereira, who was sleeping. Once awake, he simply said \"Yes, they called you, you will go\", without showing the slightest interest in what one of his own batteries would do, negatively impressing Sanches. To save time, he presented himself without his troops to the REsI's commander, Colonel Abner Moreira. In what Sanches' saw as an absurd moment, Abner gave orders to his sub-unit even though it belonged to another formation whose commander was in the same barracks. He was sent to the Rio–São Paulo axis, leaving after midnight, and on the way he met the REsI battalion, which had already left, under Major Simon. They talked found themselves with a similar political position.\nThe 3rd Battery belonged to Captain Affonso de Alencastro Graça. He was, in contrast to the loyalists, \"among those who thought something had to be done\". Their operations staff officer, Captain Willy Seixas, and the battery commanders found that it would be impossible to rise up inside ther barracks, as they would be surrounded. Instead, they agreed to move forward and, wherever they went, they would join the \"revolutionary forces\". The 3rd Battery and the 1st, of Captain José Antônio da Silveira, followed behind the vanguard.\nThe GUEs also had the 1st Group of 90mm anti-aircraft guns, from which the 2nd battery was moved, under Captain Brilhante Ustra. Ustra recounted an unusual arrangement: the soldiers, corporals and captain were actually from the 4th battery, and an older captain, Cavalero, accompanied him in the command jeep. Ustra had realized that the objective of the arrangement was for the most politically reliable elements, Cavalero and the sergeants, to take control, and after protests he managed to get the soldiers and corporal to be his own. In addition to the division between supporters and opponents of the government within the battery itself, it would leave without nurses and kitchen supplies and with very little food and water. A movement over asphalt would wear out the rubber tracks on the tractors that towed the guns, and the battery would be useless in providing anti-aircraft support to a moving column, as its function was to defend sensitive points and it took hours to get into position. This battery was to depart in the morning.\n\n\n=== Movement of the 2nd Army ===\n\nZerbini managed to retain his troops in their quarters on the night of 31 March, but in the early hours of 1 April his authority dissolved. At 01:00 he tried to contact the 5th RI, only to discover that the barracks were empty and the men had left in trucks. He sent a motorized patrol in search of the regiment, but it never gave him any news. At 06:00 he heard from the commander of the 6th RI that he would advance to Resende under direct orders from Kruel. Between 6 and 7 o'clock, he communicated with Aluísio, who declared himself on the rebel side and moved through the valley with the 2nd Mechanized Reconnaissance Squadron. For Zerbini, the only thing left to do was delay the 2nd Army until the arrival of troops from Rio de Janeiro. He managed to accompany Aluísio to Resende, from where he intended to leave for Rio de Janeiro, but ended up being arrested at AMAN.\nThe 5th RI managed to travel in army trucks and three private buses, and the 6th, in private trucks and the Pássaro Marrom company's buses. The 1st Light Tank Battalion (BCCL) from Campinas continued to board trains, although, according to Colonel Cid de Camargo Osório, from the General Staff of the 2nd Army, its movement was delayed by the \"internal enemy\", which managed to cut off electricity supply. The transport situation was difficult, and they had to provide resources to personnel who were still on foot. Fuel along the way was guaranteed by governor Adhemar de Barros. Under his order, Postos Atlantic's petrol stations filled vehicle tanks \"without bureaucracy; a 'note' was signed and that was it\".\nThe movement of the 2nd 105 mm Howitzer Regiment (2nd RO 105), from Itu, is detailed in two testimonies from participating officers. Ready since Monday, the regiment anxiously awaited confirmation from Kruel until seeing him on television at dawn. At night, sub-lieutenant Rubens had tried to convince corporals and soldiers not to stand against the government and the \"workers' movement\", being workers themselves; he was personally arrested by the regiment's intelligence staff officer. Lacking vehicles, the regiment received eight civilian ones. Colonel Benedicto Maia Pinto de Almeida was in command. The 1st Howitzer Battery of Captain Dario Scoralick went first, leaving for São Paulo at 07:30 with four of the civilian trucks. Two had ammunition and two had camping material, but were covered in tarpaulin inscribed the writing: \"Ammunition - Danger\", in a bluff to hide their lack of ammunition. On the way, it was reached by two to three vehicles from the Regimental General Staff and a regimental health team. In Jundiaí, they feared a reaction from the commanders of the Divisional Artillery and the 2nd 155 mm Howitzer Group (2nd GO 155), whose base was well positioned to block the road. Colonel Benedicto made a phone call to trusted officers there and they kept the two commanders in the artillery barracks, in the center, far from the city, where they did not interfere with the route. From São Paulo, they continued to the entrance to Via Dutra waiting for the 4th RI, which, however, was not there. Itu's artillery continued ahead.\n\n\n=== AMAN's decision ===\nThe Military Academy of Agulhas Negras (AMAN), in Resende, was halfway along the road where then 2nd Army and GUEs converged. Thus, its commander, Brigade General Emílio Garrastazu Médici, was forced to choose a side. The strategic location of the academy was no coincidence, having been chosen based on geopolitical criteria. According to then Colonel Antônio Jorge Côrrea, deputy commander of the academy, inaction would have meant watching with \"arms crossed, like eunuchs\", as the 1st and 2nd Army fought in Resende, threatening life in the Academic City. Médici chose the 2nd Army. He had been in contact with Kruel and Mourão Filho since 1963, agreeing with the uprising as soon as he heard about it on 31 March. However, until then he had not participated in the conspiracy against Goulart. Therefore, his choice to side with Kruel and Mourão Filho's cause may have been a way to gain prestige with the coup's leadership. But on an ideological and psychological level, the decision was not sudden, as anti-communism, which targeted Goulart among right-wing officers, had been cultivated at the academy for years.\nAt 17:30 on 31 March, under orders from the 1st Army, the Command and Services Battalion (BCSv) was already on standby. It was a large unit, although it only consisted of a Company of Guards and support elements. The Operational General Staff was activated, drawing up plans to occupy the city and requisition supplies; by evening the manifesto was ready. At 20:30 the cadets were informed of the rebellion taking place in Minas Gerais. At 02:00, Artur da Costa e Silva, the \"revolutionary\" leader in Guanabara and a friend of Médici, called to request his support, which was promised. Then, at 02:30, Kruel called and received a guarantee of free passage through the Paraíba Valley. Âncora called at 03:00 and informed that the GUEs was on its way and would pass through Resende at noon. Ten minutes later, Médici informed his officers that he would use the cadets in his operation. The decision was to participate in the \"revolutionary movement\" defending Via Dutra in the stretch between Itatiaia and Barra Mansa.\nIn the morning, the manifestos \"Brothers in Arms\", addressed to the entire country but especially to the 1st Army, and \"Brothers of the Armed Forces\", to the Naval Academy and the Aeronautics School, were issued by all available means. Elio Gaspari described the manifesto as \"poetic in vein\" and cautious, being \"capable of surviving an agreement\". The news of AMAN's defection to the coup raised the morale of the rebels throughout the country.\nThere was dissent within the academy, leading to the arrest of sergeants, cadets, and officers. Major Ernani Jorge Côrrea, commander of the Cavalry Course, mentioned the arrest of three lieutenants, noting that disagreements were few. Captain Geise Ferrari, commander of the Infantry Course, stated that he did not find any dropout among officers or cadets, but a cadet and a sergeant were preventively arrested. It was also necessary to deny the sergeants access to ammunition stocks, as it was feared that they could be government supporters. Captain Dickens Ferraz, the artillery instructor, stated that together with other officers, he had so much enthusiasm that, if Médici had not made up his mind, they would have crossed the Itatiaia mountain range to join the Minas Gerais rebels.\nAccording to the plan, the city was occupied, including the City Hall; Mayor Augusto presented himself to be arrested and Médici refused his surrender. However, he was later detained. Teachers took over the press. Fuel stations were closed and fuel was only distributed with military authorization.\nThe closest 1st Army formation was the 1st Armored Infantry Battalion (1st BIB), from Barra Mansa. Its commander, Colonel Nilo de Queirós Lima, sided with Médici. The 1st BIB operated with a \"very reduced structure\", but had armored vehicles. It did not participate in the front line, remaining in Volta Redonda. Major Corrêa, who was one of the academy's troop commanders, and Captain Walter Kluge Guimarães, one of his subordinates, attested that they expected to find the 1st BIB defending the road in Barra Mansa (according to Corrêa, this was what the academy's deputy commander reported), but were surprised by a call from the battalion commander, who said he was busy dealing with the unrest at the plant. According to Colonel Osório, from the General Staff of the 2nd Army, Kruel's proposed plan was to mount a defense with the 5th and 6th RIs, the 1st BIB and the BCSv, but Médici refused, as he wanted to place the Cadet Corps on the frontline. Médici's refusal to replace the cadets is reiterated by the writer Eurilo Duarte.\n\n\n== Meeting of the armies ==\n\n\n=== Cadets in Via Dutra ===\nThe 2nd Army had not arrived: its most forward forces only crossed the border later on 1 April. As the 1st BIB was in Volta Redonda, the only obstacle on the highway to the passage of the loyalist forces were the cadets themselves. Their participation on the frontline may be surprising in two ways: the use of cadets in combat has a bad record in other countries, and the move of the Military School of Realengo to Resende had been done to keep students away from politics, which had led to the spread of tenentism and then communism.\nInitially, from 06:00 to 08:30, a vanguard made up of a cavalry squadron and engineers left to take a defensive position on the heights that dominate Ribeirão da Divisa. Colonel Potyguara, commander of the Cadets Corps, remained at an outpost. At 09:30, the bulk of the cadets left in the following positions:\n\nAt kilometer 277, the motorized Cavalry Squadron, under Major Ernani Jorge Corrêa, in a delaying position. With 70–80 men, they could block the road with heavy vehicles from a construction company. According to Captain Guimarães, only half a lane was blocked to allow civilian traffic, and some drivers, after dialogue, returned to the Viúva Graça belvedere and returned with information about the loyalists.\nAt kilometer 278, an Engineering Platoon. They were ready to detonate the Guarita and RFFSA viaducts. The destruction of the viaducts would force the loyalists to cross the river before Barra Mansa and approach from the other side, where the roads were nothing more than trails. When retreating, the cavalry would be met at kilometer 283, close to the Cilbrás factory, of the White Martins company, and the viaduct over the railway, by a reinforced Infantry Company under Captain Geise Ferrari. Any other force that arrived would not be considered friendly. There were 250 men, all that the Infantry Course could muster, organized into \"three platoons of riflemen, a platoon of 106 recoilless guns, a platoon of 4.2 mortars, a section of 81 mortars, a section of 60 mortars, a section of 75 mm recoilless guns, a section of 57 recoilless guns and a section of heavy machine guns\". The soldiers prepared their gun emplacements perpendicular to the highway. The infantry was fully motorized. Its original position was further back, in Ribeirão da Divisa, and was only later moved further ahead.\nAt kilometer 286 there was a 105mm Howitzer Battery under Captain Dickens Ferraz. They loaded the ammunition on vehicles from 18:00 on the 31 March and headed to the highway in the morning, in fragile vehicles from the Engineering Course. While the commander and his Reconnaissance Officer looked for a place to occupy, they adopted a waiting position, leaving their howitzers in a roadside firing position, to fire on a bump further ahead if the enemy came.\nIn addition to them, there were two teams from the Communications Course. Lieutenant Taveira spent the night setting up telephone lines to the positions. Captain Guimarães recalled that, from his cavalry position, communication with the rearguard was only made through emissaries on the road. At the artillery position, there was no radio. The Command and Services Battalion, with its Company of Guards, maintained fuel stocks along the highway.\n\n\n=== Arrival at Resende/Barra Mansa ===\n\nThe São Paulo troops had already arrived: at 11:30 the 5th RI approached Resende, staying in the east, at 12:30 the 2nd RO 105, CPOR/SP Battery and 1st Company of the BCCL arrived at AMAN and at 12:45 the 2nd Mechanized Reconnaissance Squadron to Itatiaia. According to Colonel Osório, General Aluísio was inefficient in using this squadron, holding it back instead of sending it forward as reconnaissance.\nOn the other side, the GUEs' vanguard arrived at the entrance to the city of Barra Mansa at 13:00, making contact with their opponents. It was made up of a reinforced battalion of the Infantry School-Regiment (REsI), with 800 men, a company of tanks and the 2nd Battery of the Artillery School Group (GEsA). The 2nd Battery occupied a firing position. The 1st and 3rd batteries arrived at 14:00. The logistical situation of the 2nd Battery was precarious, with little food. An academy patrol made first contact with the loyalists on an elevation after Barra Mansa.\nThe anti-aircraft component never arrived. It left at 09:00, but under orders from Captain Ustra, the movement was delayed: tires were deflated and vehicles broke down. At 20:00 it had not gone beyond Serra das Araras. A company from the Engineering School Battalion that accompanied the column also did not go beyond the Serra das Araras.\n\n\n=== Climax ===\n\nThe GUEs and the academy were no more than 5 or 30 km away. The terrain was the highway, with elevations making movement difficult on both sides. For the 2nd Army, \"the prospect of a frontal clash with the Rio de Janeiro troops was terrible, and bloodshed was imagined\". With the cadets on the road, however, it was kept further behind. The possibility of conflict would then be between the cadets and the troops coming from Guanabara. It would be disproportionate. The academy was outnumbered and outgunned — 800 REsI soldiers against 250 infantry and 70-80 cavalry cadets. The REsI was an elite troop, and the only infantry regiment with full personnel and the best equipment of the Brazil-United States Military Agreement.\nAlthough the cadets are remembered as elite troops, those who passed or served at the academy emphasized their unpreparedness in testimonies. The difficult situation of the artillery is noted in the testimonies of Captain Ferraz and one of his subordinates, Lieutenant José Carlos Lisbôa da Cunha, an assistant on the fire line. Their battery had 250 shells, while the GEsA's 1st and 3rd combined had 35 thousand. The 3rd year cadets had barely begun artillery instruction and knew little about line of fire and shooting techniques. They were unaware of vertical fire, which was required by the rugged terrain and the position chosen for the howitzers. They received instructions in the field, but \"anyone who knows shooting technique knows that you cannot improvise\". There was still a lack of a topographic map and not even a single radio, with communication initially taking place through visual contact. Under these conditions, for the commander, \"we would certainly be massacred, given the combat power of the troops in front of us\". Despite recognizing the disproportion, Captain Ferrari opined that the advance of the GUEs would be difficult with the obstacles in the way and the destruction of the bridges would force it to reach the highway from the other side, where the roads were little better than trails, unfeasible for heavy vehicles. He praised the meticulousness of the cadets he commanded.\n\nMédici's tactic, however, was psychological, using the cadets as a \"psychological brake\". This would have been precisely the reason why he insisted on having cadets, and not soldiers from São Paulo, on the front line. The \"Brothers in Arms\" manifesto made the following appeal: \"Do not try to cut off so many vocations in the cradle\". His logic was that the \"School-Regiment's officers, knowing that they would face poorly-armed cadets, would have to wonder how to get over them. Many had children, brothers and relatives in AMAN. If they no longer had convincing arguments to support João Goulart's government, they'd be even less willing to shoot young men, almost children\". The manifesto was even delivered to General Anfrísio.\nThe unwillingness to fight was seen in the two GEsA howitzer batteries that arrived at 14:00, the 1st and the 3rd. Instead of taking up firing positions, they proceeded at high speed along Via Dutra and joined the academy. After the cavalry passed, the infantry was unaware and there was almost friendly fire, but the confusion was soon resolved. The REsI's 4.2 Heavy Mortar Platoon refused the order to prepare to fire on the cadets.\nIn Queluz, Colonel Souza Lobo, commander of the 6th RI, spoke to journalists. The situation presented by Correio da Manhã was of a large additional number of 1st Army vehicles well before the Barra Mansa region, which the REsI, if it chose to defect, could resist in the mountains. There was no exchange of fire; at 15:00 a truce was reached, with both sides remaining in position, faced with a new reality: the arrival of General Âncora to negotiate with Kruel at the academy.\n\n\n=== Defection of the loyalist batteries ===\n\nThe defection of parts of the GEsA is detailed in testimonies from its participants, Captain Graça, commander of the 3rd Battery, and 2nd Lieutenant Oacyr Pizzotti Minervino, his deputy commander, in addition to 2nd Lieutenant Sanches, commander of the 2nd Battery and an eyewitness to what happened. The 1st Battery belonged to Captain Silveira. Captains Brunner, deputy commander of GEsA, and Seixas, from his General Staff, led the defection, which was already the intention when they left Guanabara. It broke with the authority of Colonel Aldo, commander of the GEsA.\nApproaching the contact line, before the Dupont factory in Barra Mansa, GEsA stopped. Brunner asked, \"Who is the enemy? Where does he come from?\" Until then, they did not know. Along with his officers, Colonel Aldo ordered them to take a position and support the REsI against the academy. Until then, they were unaware of their opponent. Then the following dialogue took place between Seixas or Brunner and Colonel Aldo:\n\n- Are you going to shoot cadets?\n- We are soldiers and we receive orders. It's legal, the mission exists, and we must fulfill it. It is a bitter mission, but one that must be accomplished.\nSeixas, Brunner, Graça and Silveira immediately decided on another course of action. The two captains formed their batteries into a group under the leadership of Seixas. Each captain informed his men that they would pass through REsI and meet the cadets, crossing to the other side. Captain Graça consulted 2nd Lieutenant Pizzotti regarding the loyalty of the officers — \"I drag them\". But as the sergeants were a risk, he ordered them to be kept without ammunition and information about their destination, telling them that it would be a reconnaissance task. \"But it will be difficult to hide; reconnaissance with the entire force! People will be suspicious\"; \"It's your problem, get over it\". In the seat of each vehicle, in addition to the driver and the sergeant, there was an officer. The sergeants, in fact, noticed an abnormality and Pizzotti, clarifying that it was \"a different reconnaissance\", insisted that they not question the order. Some ended up detained. They resisted due to legality and the government's ideological appeal, and with the exception of one, they would resume their functions upon return.\nThe movement would have to be quick, as it would cross the existing defensive line, with which there was no coordination and which, dominating the elevations, could target them in the back. The columns left as if to take up positions and hastily headed towards Resende. The Service Battery's ammunition vehicles followed, as their acting commander was also against the government. They crossed the REsI battalion and the 2nd Battery. The commander of the former stopped his jeep next to the latter and noted: \"they crossed over to the other side...\" and did nothing more than that: there was no problem on the part of the REsI, which was there unwillingly. Lieutenant Sanches ordered the telephone line to be cut to silence Colonel Aldo, who was approaching. The latter, from the road curb, noticed the desertion of most of his group, and \"in tears\", exclaimed: \"Traitors! Traitors!\". He threatened to commit suicide, but the REsI battalion's major held his hand.\nCaptain Graça went ahead in a jeep to warn the cadets that the group was passing alongside them and they should not be scared. They were welcomed by the cavalry and moved on.\nThe cavalry did not inform the infantry, who were moving to a position further ahead. As they crossed a curve, they saw an unknown force meeting them in the distance — 2.5-ton trucks pulling howitzers from the batteries. They immediately blocked the road with their vehicles and took up positions on the slopes. Through binoculars, Captain Ferrari saw Captain Adir, from the academy, in the first jeep, concluding that it was a deforce that had defected. With orders not to fire, the academy infantry blocked the batteries, and there was a gathering. The academy's artillery was also unaware of the defection. From above, they saw the GEsA trucks and knew they were from the other side, as the academy did not have those trucks. For a few tense moments they thought about opening fire, but then they saw soldiers standing next to the vehicles' passenger compartment, waving white shirts. As they approached, they saw the commander and lieutenants who had the sergeants at gunpoint. The GEsA batteries arrived at the academy, encountering 2nd Army artillery units.\n\n\n== Âncora–Kruel conference ==\n\nAfter Goulart's departure from Rio de Janeiro, Âncora's authority at the head of the 1st Army (and, on an interim basis, the Ministry of War) began to deteriorate. Goulart instructed him to negotiate with Kruel, in a last-ditch effort to make Kruel back down. When Âncora called the presidential palace for further clarification, the president had already left and the person who responded was the head of the Military Cabinet, General Assis Brasil; without assuming to speak on behalf of the president, Assis Brasil stated that Goulart had orderem them not to cause a military conflict. Thus, according to Thomas Skidmore, the time had come to stop resistance.\nIn the early afternoon Âncora received a call from Costa e Silva, who asked him to join the coup, but he refused. \"Âncora, you must imagine that this situation you are in, this movement you are noticing, did not sprout from the ground like nutsedge, which takes nothing to sprout\". He recognized that his cause was lost and proposed negotiation with Kruel. Costa e Silva accepted and mediated the parties. At Kruel's request, the location was AMAN, in the territory already controlled by the 2nd Army. By car, Âncora arrived at 17:00 or in the middle of the afternoon \"in a deplorable state, suffering from an asthma attack\". Médici received him with buglers and all the honors due to his position. Âncora was reluctanct, defining himself as a losing commander, and hearing in response that \"there are no losers but the enemies of the Fatherland\". While waiting for Kruel, he spoke with General Aluísio Mendes and heard erroneous news on the radio that Goulart had resigned. Zerbini, who was also at AMAN, asked Âncora for a command in Rio de Janeiro in order to continue the loyalist cause, hearing in response \"that the government was leaderless and that the president was no longer in Rio de Janeiro and was no longer president\".\nKruel's car broke down on the way and he was late. He arrived at 17:40, with the meeting taking place at 18:00. It did not have the \"humiliating formality of a surrender\", but it was not very friendly; Kruel reportedly said: \"You just came to say good night! You're no longer a minister and don't think about resisting!\" While Âncora was away, Costa e Silva took over the Ministry of War at 17:00. Âncora originally went to Resende wanting to negotiate, but successive defections of his forces to the opponent led to his military defeat. For him, his mission was over. The 1st Army surrendered, and Costa e Silva's position was recognized — it was in Kruel's interest to deny the position to his rival, General Castelo Branco. Any possibility of resistance in Rio de Janeiro ended, although the loyalists still had power in Rio Grande do Sul. \"Âncora returns alone and will leave history\".\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe operations came to an end, soldiers returned to their barracks and the rebellion triumphed. Médici's decision entered positively into military memory, and the historical narrative constructed around it was \"almost mythological\". His decision to defend the Via Dutra with his cadets is considered to be responsible for preventing the loyalist advance, and ultimately, ending Âncora's resistance to the coup. There is, however, another way of understanding what happened: Âncora was under pressure from Costa e Silva, who suggested surrender, and it was Âncora himself who proposed a meeting with Kruel. Elio Gaspari contextualized the surrender in the dissolution of the \"military apparatus\" in the 1st Army after Goulart left Rio de Janeiro.\nUpon returning to the academy, the following day, the cadets with dirty and even torn uniforms were received by military personnel from the academy and from São Paulo and civilians from Resende, showing the support of part of the local population for Médici's position. The BCSv was not yet completely demobilized. The academy supported the activities of the 1st BIB in Volta Redonda and Barra Mansa and received prisoners sent from there.\n\n\n== Strike at Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional ==\n\nThe steel hub in Volta Redonda, the Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional (CSN), was a military-technocratic project from the Estado Novo era, a pillar of the Brazil's security and development strategy and still strongly associated with the military. The company's president, admiral Lúcio Meira, was a government supporter, but the board was divided, with a faction opposing him. CSN's industrial directorate had a Company Security Plan, a \"secret police\" and proximity to the 1st Armored Infantry Battalion. With two companies, the 1st BIB had been working to disperse labor unrest in the region since the 1950s.\nVolta Redonda was of great importance for the Brazil's left, having been visited by Luís Carlos Prestes, Leonel Brizola, Maurício Grabois and Wladimir Pomar. The large number of workers supported an organized labor movement disputed between laborists and communists. In the 1950s, both had agreed to spare CSN from strikes due to its importance for Brazil's sovereignty, but under the leadership of communist João Alves dos Santos Lima Neto (1963-1964) a threat of strike at the company had been made for the first time.\nOnce the coup began, the Metalworkers Union prepared to react. Faced with imminent disturbances, industrial director Mauro Mariano activated the pre-existing plan, which aimed to keep the plant running and neutralize the strike. He put management on alert and mobilized supervisiors, who occupied their positions until 06:00 on 1 April. The civil-military command proved to be well articulated. The union's telephones were blocked, and CSN's mutual traffic with the Companhia Telefônica Brasileira was controlled, prohibiting any call without the approval of the industrial director, in order to restrict the possibility of coordination between the union and the Plant Departments.\nA labor group led by Othon Reis Fernandes occupied Rádio Siderúrgica, on Laranjal hill, and put it live at around 06:30. It was then closed by the intervention of the 1st BIB, which parked an armored vehicle in front of the radio station, but returned to air at 09:00 on orders from Lúcio Meira. Integrated into the pro-government \"Legality Chain\", it broadcast messages in favor of the president until 16:20, when it began to obey the orders of the Industrial Director.\nWorkers who showed up in the morning found the entrance at the upper passage guarded by the army, and pickets set up to prevent their entry. The crowd was dispersed at 07:00, and most ended up entering. Union activists led by Lima Neto managed to enter, but the strike inside was only partial. The leaders were arrested, (such as Lima Neto, who, arriving at 07:30, was already arrested at 10:00) to dismantle the strike and intimidate the union, but the news ended up encouraging workers to join the strike.\nAt the union headquarters, the possibility of dynamiting the Central do Brasil rail lines to prevent the passage of troops was considered, but the unionists chose to wait for events. After 9–11:00 they found that Lima Neto was arrested and the 1st BIB was in Arrozal, on Via Dutra. After 17:15, people leaving work gathered in front of the headquarters, where a crowd formed a cordon. Around dusk, the 1st BIB took positions on Amaral Peixoto, 200 meters away, with at least one armored car. They invaded the headquarters, dispersed the crowd and took all documents. A large number of trade unionists were ultimately imprisoned in the 1st BIB and AMAN.\nWithin a week, all union leaders were arrested. The unsuccessful mobilization of the trade union movement and communists showed disorganization, and after the coup the number of communists identified was not large, which also reveals a limited reach among the popular classes. Repressive action since the 1950s and the influence of the military on the daily lives of the population may have reduced the spread of communist ideas in the region.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBooks\n\nArticles and academic works",

        "content": "Fredrik Akrel (27 May 1748 – 6 November 1804) was a Swedish globe maker and artist.\nFredrik Akrel was born in present-day Eskilstuna Municipality. His father was a vicar. His mother, Elisabeth Castrén, came from Karelia. His son, Carl Fredrik Akrel, became a general in the Swedish Army and a cartographer.\nFredrik Akrel studied at Uppsala University, where he learnt engraving from Anders Åkerman. After moving to Stockholm around 1770, he made a career illustrating scientific and popular books. In 1773–1774 he travelled to Paris with the aim of furthering his artistic studies. However, the trip appears to have had little effect on his development, and furthermore he was robbed of his travel funds and had to return prematurely to Sweden. After his return, he was employed by Carl Bergqvist, the engraver of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and following Bergqvist's death in 1778, Akrel took over his position at the academy.\nIn 1778 his former teacher Åkerman died, and Akrel was given the opportunity to take over the globe manufacturing workshop. At the same time, the workshop was moved from Uppsala to Stockholm and subordinated to the Academy of Sciences. Akrel engaged actively with his new tasks, seeking to modernise the geographic content of the globes produced in light of new geographic discoveries and consequently updated the globe models developed by Åkerman. From 1781 he employed an apprentice, Erik Åkerland, who with time would take over successively more of the daily running of the workshop. The death of Akrel's wife in 1797 appears to have weighed heavily on him, and his engagement in the workshop diminished even more. He died in Stockholm in 1804.\n\n\n== References ==\nCitations\n\nSources\n\nBratt, Einar (1968). En krönika om svenska glober.

        "content": "Since early in the history of flight, non-human animals have been dropped from heights with the benefit of parachutes. Early on, animals were used as test subjects for parachutes and as entertainment. Following the development of the balloon, dogs, cats, fowl, and sheep were dropped from heights. During the 18th and 19th-century ballooning craze known as balloonomania, many aeronauts included parachuting animals such as monkeys in their demonstrations.\nLater, animals were parachuted from airplanes, as test subjects, for amusement, and as a means of transporting working animals. During World War II, the many dogs parachuted from planes came to be known as \"paradogs\". Animal test subjects included a bear parachuted at supersonic speeds. Bat bombs, devised by the U.S. military, were designed to parachute a canister containing thousands of bomb-laden bats in Japan. Parachutes have also been used to transport animals, including mules and sheepdogs. In 1948, beaver drops in the United States parachuted beavers that were considered nuisances to remote locations.\nMany animals were sent into space as test subjects and would return to Earth in capsules with parachutes.\n\n\n== Early parachute tests and balloonomania ==\nThe development of the parachute in the 18th century followed the invention of the balloon. Some of the earliest tests of parachutes involved dogs, cats, and domesticated fowl. In a 19 September 1783 demonstration in Versailles observed by Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI, a duck, a rooster, and a sheep were carried by a Montgolfier brother balloon for eight minutes.\n\nIn the early 1780s, Louis-Sébastien Lenormand parachuted a cat and a dog from the top of Babotte Tower in Montpellier, France. In 1784, the Marquis de Brantes parachuted a sheep from the roof of the Palais des Papes in Avignon. Soon after, Joseph Montgolfier dropped animals from towers to test parachute-like devices.\nDuring the balloon craze known as balloonomania in the late 18th and 19th centuries, balloonists, known then as aeronauts, began experimenting with parachuting animals.\n\n\n=== Jean-Pierre Blanchard ===\nThe aeronaut Jean-Pierre Blanchard parachuted dozens of animals from balloons during his career. On 3 June 1785, he made a successful test of a parachute using a dog. Blanchard later dropped a cat and more dogs from parachutes. His attempt to drop a sheep with a parachute was unsuccessful. Later that year, a Mr Durry in Ireland repeated the feat, with a dog \"suspended over the side of the gondola, wearing nothing but a parachute, and dropped\".\nBlanchard took a 12 lb (5.4 kg) cat up in his balloon. He placed the cat in a net connected by a long cord to a parachute and then slowly lowered the parachute from the gondola until it opened up. The cat descended to the ground. Blanchard also dropped a dog attached to a large chute, twice, over Lille. The second time was witnessed by Prince de Robecq and the \"dog received no hurt\" according to an article in Gentleman's Magazine. In 1788, Blanchard made a demonstration for Frederick the Great, placing a bird and a cat in a basket that was attached to the parachute. The animals lived.\n\nThe Cat, who was very unquiet in the state of slavery, appeared to have forgot its voracious nature, having spared the companion of its voyage; and the Bird appeared to have grown bold by the circumstance, and kept perched on the back of its enemy.\nOn 5 June 1793, Blanchard parachuted a dog, a cat, and a squirrel in Philadelphia. The animals were placed in a basket that was tethered to his balloon. A slow-burning fuse was set that released the basket while the balloon was mid-air, dropping the animals on the ground near Bush Hill. Blanchard repeated the demonstration on 17 and 21 June. A writer for the City Gazette in South Carolina claimed that Blanchard had thrown over 60 animals \"from the height of the clouds\" that had parachuted to safety. Blanchard's wife Sophie also parachuted dogs from her balloon. In 1789, Blanchard demonstrated a parachuting dog for the Polish king Stanisław August Poniatowski.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nIn April 1835, a dog was parachuted from the roof of a theatre in Cincinnati, Ohio. That same year, balloonist Charles Green parachuted a monkey from the Surrey Zoological Gardens named Jacopo from his balloon as he was over Walworth. Jacopo would later return to the air with Margaret Graham two years later.\nBalloon-parachute acts were popular in the mid to late 19th century and sometimes included animals. In 1886, the aeronaut Emil Leandro Melville in San Francisco repeatedly parachuted a small arboreal monkey from his balloon. Meanwhile, Maud DeHaven and Richard P. Hill had parachuting dogs. The exploits of parachuting balloonist Thomas Scott Baldwin were replicated in 1889 by a rhesus macaque known as \"the Monkey Baldwin\" at English music halls. Twice a day the monkey would parachute from the roof of the Royal Aquarium in Westminster. His handler Mademoiselle Eichlerette reported training three \"Monkey Baldwins\" and toured India and the United States for six years with her act. In 1893, aeronaut Jennie Leland had a parachuting dog named \"Rollo\" as part of her act.\n\nThe American aeronaut Hazel Keyes had a monkey named \"Miss Jennie Yan-Yan\" who was one of the most famous parachuting monkeys. Keyes toured the U.S. west coast in the 1890s with Jennie Yan-Yan, who had her own miniature parachute. While Keyes suffered injuries during several of her exhibitions, Jennie Yan-Yan was seemingly never harmed. During an exhibition in Austin, Texas, Keyes and Jennie were suspended 1,000 feet over Lake Austin. While Keyes failed to reach the powerhouse of the Austin Dam, Jennie jumped from her shoulder with a miniature parachute and descended to the waters below. William Kalt, who wrote a book about Keyes, said:\n\n\"I don't mean to laugh, but so many of those news reports are similar, and they almost always end by mentioning that the monkey was not harmed. She would have these horrific accidents, where everyone nearly died, yet she kept getting right back up in that balloon!\"\nA trained bonnet macaque named Mrs. Murphy made at least 150 parachute jumps during her tour of Europe and the United States in 1899 and 1900. She was purchased by her handler in India when she was two years old. She would hold her hands together and \"pray\" prior to her ascent in the balloon and then parachute solo from heights of around 1,000 ft (300 m).\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nParachuting animals continued to draw crowds in the 20th century. The parachuting monkey Bimbo made a series of balloon ascensions around Montana in 1906. On August 16, at the Columbia Gardens amusement park, mid-way through his parachute descent before a crowd of thousands, he fell. He had apparently gnawed through the ropes tying him to the parachute, fell around 1,000 ft (300 m), and was \"crushed to a shapeless pulp on the roof of the pavilion\". In 1912, a chimpanzee named Topsy performed around the United States in a balloon-parachute act. Air shows with stunt flyers also featured parachuting animals. Harold \"Daredevil\" Lockwood, for one, had a parachuting dog in 1928.\nDespite growing concerns for animal welfare in parachute acts, few performances were stopped. Nonetheless, the use of animals in daredevil acts became increasingly rare in the 20th century. In 1929, two planned parachute drops of monkeys at Roosevelt Field in Long Island were cancelled. The first, by Charles de Bevere and his monkey \"Jumpy\" was stopped by clubwomen from Garden City. A second drop, by parachutist Saul Debever and his monkey, was halted under threat of prosecution by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.\n\n\n== Military parachuting animals ==\n\nAnimals have long been used in the military as working animals, mascots, and test subjects. As airplane and parachute technology advanced in the 20th century, there was an increasing incidence of parachuting animals, particularly dogs.\n\n\n=== Paradogs ===\nParachuting dogs, sometimes referred to as \"paradogs\", have been frequently employed by militaries.\nIn the early 1920s, a dog named Jeff made multiple successful jumps with the Colorado Air National Guard. In his final jump in August 1924, Jeff's chute did not open. Later in 1935, an article in Popular Science featured a successful Soviet experimental parachute for a locked coop for dogs that sprang open when it hit the ground.\n\nDuring World War II, the British 13th Parachute Battalion recruited dogs. The dogs served as mascots but were also trained to detect mines and serve as guard dogs. The Collie-German Shepherd mix breed dog Bing parachuted into Normandy on D-Day, though he had to be thrown out of the plane. He landed in a tree but survived and later parachuted into western Germany in March 1945 as part of Operation Varsity. Bing was awarded a Dickin Medal. Two other German Shepherds with the battalion, Ranee and Monty, also served as paradogs.\nSmoky, a famous Yorkshire terrier in World War II, was parachuted from trees at heights of 30 ft (9.1 m). She was parachuted as a stunt by her handler Bill Wynne and won the Best Mascot of the Southwest Pacific Area award. Rob, a Collie, was alleged to have made over 20 parachute descents during the North African campaign of World War II, serving with the SAS, and was awarded a Dickin Medal. In 2006, his jumps were revealed as a possible hoax perpetrated by members of his regiment to prevent the dog from returning to his original owners.\nSome paradogs were killed in action. A Doberman with the 463rd Parachute Field Artillery and a German Shepherd named Jaint de Montmorency with the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, both of the US, dropped into France in 1944 and were killed in action.\nThe U.S. Army experimented with parachuting Siberian Huskies with water and K-rations to bring to stranded soldiers. The dogs were taken up in a transport plane and pushed out of the side door, sometimes two dogs per parachute, on a static line which would open after they cleared the door. In the 1950s, during Operation Deep Freeze, a series of United States missions to Antarctica, working dogs were intended to be parachuted in.\nMost modern parachuting dogs have specially designed harnesses and make tandem jumps with their handlers.\n\n\n=== Bat bombs ===\n\nDuring World War II, the United States military developed an experimental weapon known as a bat bomb. The device consisted of a bomb-shaped casing with over a thousand compartments, each containing a hibernating Mexican free-tailed bat with a small, timed incendiary bomb attached. Dropped from a bomber at dawn, the casings would deploy a parachute mid-flight and open to release the bats, which would then disperse and roost in eaves and attics in a 20–40-mile radius (32–64 km). The incendiaries, which were set on timers, would then ignite and start fires in inaccessible places in the largely wood and paper constructions of the Japanese cities that were the weapon's intended target.\n\n\n=== Parachuting mules ===\nAttempts were made by the U.S. Army in 1942 to parachute mules. In one attempt, a dozen mules were taken up in an airplane. Six of them could not be pushed out of the airplane, while another six were dropped in slings attached to parachutes. Unfortunately, the jerk from the opening of the chutes severed the mules' mesenteric arteries, killing them. During the Burma Campaign, mules were flown in to the Chindits, long-range penetration forces on the ground. Lt. Col. K. I. Barlow suggested parachuting the animals and arranged trial drops at the Air Transport Development Centre in Chaklala, Punjab. An elderly, sedated mule was placed at the centre of nylon bladder pontoons that were fastened to a platform. Two triple clusters of 28 ft (8.5 m) statichutes were used and the mule was dropped from 600 ft (180 m), landing at 15 ft/s (4.6 m/s). After the successful test, mules were transported via the Chabua 44th Air Depot from Assam, India.\n\nIt was hard to know who kicked harder. The mules slipped and slid on an aluminum floor, protesting every shove toward the portside drop. The Americans dropped their mules from a height of 2000 to 3000 feet. Three large 'chutes per mule were not enough to guarantee a happy landing. Those that didn't make it became fresh rations.\nLater in 1945, the British successfully devised crates with airbags for 900 lb (410 kg) mules that were dropped by parachute from C-47s. The U.S. Army experimented again with parachuting a mule in 1946. A sedated mule was strapped to a padded pallet and dropped from a C-47 by a static line at a height of 25,000 ft (7,600 m).\n\n\n=== Other parachuting animals ===\nJacksonia, a monkey captured from the island of Luzon, made two jumps by parachute in Japan during World War II with a sergeant from the 11th Airborne Division. Boudgie, an African parachuting monkey, received a North Africa campaign ribbon and was credited with saving the life of her handler four times. During the Vietnam War, the 173rd Airborne Brigade had a \"parachuting primate\", Pfc. Bufford L. Monkey, who joined troops on parachute jumps.\nThe Asian black bear Rocky was born in 1953 and purchased from a Kumamoto zoo to serve as a mascot for the U.S. 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team during the Korean War. She completed five parachute jumps, earning her parachutist badge. After sustaining injuries during an artillery attack, she was awarded a Purple Heart.\nDuring the Vietnam War, supply drops made to isolated outposts could include livestock such as chickens, ducks, pigs, and cows. Except for the cows, the animals were placed in bamboo wicker baskets and dropped by parachute from heights of 250–300 ft (76–91 m).\n\n\n== Equipment and skydiving ==\n\nSpecialized harnesses and other equipment for parachuting animals have developed over time. Tandem jumps have become the predominant method. Other equipment such as goggles for dogs (doggles) have been designed. The U.S. Special Operations Command's innovation cell hosted a competition to design oxygen masks for dogs in 2017. Humans have also taken dogs and other animals skydiving. Mike Forsythe and his dog Cara set a record for the highest tandem dog-human parachute deployment in 2011, making their descent from 30,100 ft (9,200 m).\n\n\n== As test subjects ==\nAlongside advancements in human flight and parachute technology, animals have served as test subjects. Initial tests of parachutes were often conducted with animals. Later, animals were parachuted from airplanes and rockets.\nDuring World War II, Major, a 145 lb (66 kg) St. Bernard, was fitted with a custom oxygen mask before being dropped from a plane at 26,000 ft (7,900 m). Witnesses to the test, which was to determine the impact of high altitudes on parachute straps, reported seeing Major dogpaddling during his descent.\nThe rhesus macaque Albert I was launched in a V-2 Rocket on 18 June 1948. The respiratory apparatus and the parachute system both failed, and Albert likely died due to breathing problems but would have died on impact anyway since the capsule's parachute failed to open. Another rhesus macaque, Albert II became the first mammal in space on 14 June 1949, but plummeted to his death after a parachute failure.\nAt Edwards Air Force Base in 1962, bears were used for a series of escape capsule ejection tests of the Convair B-58 Hustler. The first supersonic ejection test occurred on 21 March 1962 at the speed of Mach 1.3 at 35,000 ft (11,000 m) and the bear survived the nearly eight-minute parachute descent. A bear was ejected again from a height of 45,000 ft (14,000 m) on 6 April. After examination, it was determined that the bear had received minor hemorrhage of the neck muscles from whiplash and two pelvic bone fractures. On 8 June, a chimpanzee served as the test subject for the escape capsule and parachuted to the ground unharmed. Bears were sent up for subsequent tests, with one sent up on 27 July reported to have suffered \"internal injuries of some severity\".\nIn July 1962, four hamsters, two rhesus monkeys, and several flower beetles were sent in a 39-hour, 1,920 mi (3,090 km) high-altitude balloon trip from Goose Bay, Labrador, as part of an experiment by NASA's Ames Research Center to test the effects of radiation. Following the parachute descent of the capsules, it was discovered that the monkeys and hamsters had died due to a life support system failure.\nDuring the development of spaceflight, many animals were sent into space as test subjects and would return to Earth in capsules with parachutes.\n\n\n== Animal drops ==\n\n\n=== Beaver drop ===\n\nIn 1948, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game devised a program to relocate beavers from Northwestern Idaho to the Chamberlain Basin in Central Idaho. The beaver drop program was started to address complaints about property damage from residents and involved flying 76 beavers by airplane and parachuting them down to the ground. Parachuting the beavers proved to be more cost-effective than alternative methods of relocation and also decreased beaver mortality rates. An older beaver named \"Geronimo\" was a test subject for the boxes, repeatedly parachuting to the ground. The Idaho Fish and Game Department produced a 14-minute film about the relocation and the program was written up in an April 1950 article in the Journal of Wildlife Management titled \"Transplanting Beavers by Airplane and Parachute\".\n\n\n=== Sheepdog drop ===\nIn 1949, shepherds in Carbon County, Utah, had a shortage of sheepdogs to protect their flocks, many of them having been poisoned by coyote bait. Due to snow, the marooned flocks were inaccessible by land, so the Civil Air Patrol arranged for a \"doglift\" where sheepdogs were parachuted in. Parachutes were provided by the state Aeronautics Commission and a special harness for the paradogs was designed by E. L. Davis.\n\n\n=== Operation Cat Drop ===\n\nThe United Kingdom's Royal Air Force delivered cats, equipment and supplies to remote regions of the then-British colony of Sarawak (today part of Malaysia), on the island of Borneo in 1960. The cats were flown out of Singapore and delivered in crates dropped by parachutes as part of a broader program of supplying cats to combat an infestation of rats. The operation, known as Operation Cat Drop, was reported as a success at the time. Newspaper reports published soon after the Operation reference only 23 cats being used. However, some later accounts of the event claim as many as 14,000 cats were used. An additional source references a \"recruitment\" drive for 30 cats a few days before Operation Cat Drop.\n\n\n=== Anti-poaching dogs ===\nIn 2016, the South African defense contractor Paramount Group established the Anti-Poaching and Canine Training Academy. Belgian Malinois and German Shepherds trained at the facility are parachuted from helicopters to assist in tracking elephant poachers.\n\n\n=== Fish ===\nThe Utah Division of Wildlife Resources has dropped fish from aircraft to re-stock high altitude lakes since at least 1956. This is done to repopulate the lakes with fish for recreational anglers given that the fish don't naturally reproduce in them. In 2021 the agency stated that it dropped as many as 35,000 fish during each flight, with a 95 percent survival rate. Flights are conducted each summer. The Division of Wildlife Resources states that restocking the lakes by air is cheaper than transporting the fish overland and less stressful for the animals.\n\n\n== In fiction ==\nParachuting animals have been depicted in fiction numerous times. The 1945 Japanese film Momotaro: Sacred Sailors included a monkey, dog, and bear cub who become paratroopers. The 1995 film Operation Dumbo Drop concerns the delivery of an elephant by parachute during the Vietnam War. In the late 1990s, the artist Banksy produced a series of Parachuting Rat stencil art in Melbourne, depicting rats descending in parachutes. In the 1949 British film Passport to Pimlico, pigs are parachuted to the people of Pimlico.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n1948 footage of paradogs being trained in the Arctic\n1958 footage of parachuting dogs",

He then appeared on Karl Zéro's satirical news program Le Vrai Journal.

He is also a scriptwriter/dialoguist on several films, including Les Hauts Murs directed by Christian Faure; Gérard Oury's Le Schpountz; Laurent Heynemann's Un aller simple and Didier Bourdon's Bambou.\nFrom September 2007 to December 2007, he hosted the daily program On aura tout vu on Direct 8 every evening at 6 p.m., with Stéphanie Pillonca, Louise Ekland and Fréderic Martin, reviewing cultural news.\nIn 2008 and 2009, he was co-author with Éric Laugérias and Laurent Gerra, then in 2010–2011 and 2011–2012, with Pascal Fioretto, of Laurent Gerra's daily column, commenting on current affairs from Monday to Friday, on RTL, between 8:50 and 9 am.

The character of \"Père Albert\" reappears alongside Daniel Morin in À rebrousse poil, the program the latter presents every day at 11 a.m. on France Inter, during the summer of 2015.\nFrom 2015 to 2020, he appeared twice weekly on La Bande originale, Nagui's show on France Inter, with a humor column entitled \"Albert Algoud a tout compris\", where he alternated between his recurring characters who had moved from one show to the next: Father Albert (a cantankerous priest with a Savoyard accent), Marshal Ganache (a former Indo soldier and Petainist), François-François (a glittering singer), John-Jack Lang (the other guy's brother), Jean-Dominique Besnehard (speech therapist to the stars), Jean-Roger Navarro, Jean-Philippe Manœuvre...\nIn 2019, he has a column, entitled \"Il était une femme\", on Daniel Morin's weekly program Vous les femmes.

        "content": "Torrgårdsvatten is a lake in Lilla Edet Municipality in the province of Bohuslän and is part of the main catchment area of the Göta River. The lake is 29.2 meters deep, has an area of 0.493 square kilometers and has an elevation of 132.3 meters above sea level.\n\n\n== Sub-catchment area ==\nTorrgårdsvatten is part of the sub-basin (644465–128394) that SMHI calls Ovan VDRID = Gårdaån i Göta älvs vattendragsyta. The average elevation is 71 meters above sea level and has an area of 56.96 square kilometers. If the 3,128 upstream catchment areas are included, the accumulated area is 47,638.33 square kilometers. The catchment area's outflow Göta älv empties into the sea. The catchment area consists mostly of forest (61%) and agriculture (15%). The catchment area has 4.47 square kilometers of water surface, giving it a lake percentage of 7.8%. The settlements cover an area of 1.68 square kilometers or 3% of the catchment area.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the 1740s, mill owner Olof Wenngren developed an ironworks for the production of iron and similar products in the village of Thorskog on Göta River. In order to obtain sufficient water for this business, extensive work was carried out in Svartedalen to divert as much water as possible towards Thorskog.\nThe largest project concerned Torrgårdsvatten. This lake previously had an outlet to the north towards Rödvatten (17 meters difference in altitude), but now a dam was built at the outlet and a half-kilometer long canal was dug (\"in rough ground, with considerable work\") from the eastern shore of the lake to Helgesjön. From this lake, the water flows in dug ditches towards the similarly dammed Stendammen. The dam in Torrgårdsvatten was, according to the description on the map from 1750, built of earth and stone, 80 meters long, 7 meters high, 22 meters wide at the bottom, and 7 meters wide at the outlet.\nIn connection with the Berg Collegiate's survey in 1748 (description for the map in 1750), it emerged that the damming of the lake had caused a minor inconvenience for Yttre Åsen, a small meadow had been damaged. Similarly, the Lund homestead north of Rödvattnet had lost water for its mill. Otherwise, no inconvenience had been caused because dams and watercourses were located on undivided outlying land. However, a comparison with the modern map shows that the water level was clearly lower than the current level; for example, the island in the northern part of the lake was still a peninsula.\nFrom description for the map in 1750:\nThe size and location of the lakes can be seen from the map figure, of which most of the lakes have always supplied their water to Torskogs Bruk, a part, such as Torgårds Watnet, which in the autumn and spring is increased by the 2nd Swarfvareås lakes located there, as well as the many high mountains around, has now in recent times, by means of a dam of earth and stone measuring: B. 136 cubits long, 12 1/2 high, 38 cubits wide at the bottom and 12 cubits wide on top at its outlet, as well as through a canal worked out in rough terrain measuring C. 1005 cubits long, with considerable work has been left to Hälgesjön, which nowadays carries its water through the dug-up ditches to the Stendammen measuring D. of 140 cubits long, 7 wide and 7 high, with a slope to the mountains according to its location; also the Stora Metewatnet, which by means of a dam measuring E. 125 cubits long, through a channel worked out in mountains and rocks measuring F. 190 cubits long is led into Lilla Mete- and Holmewatnet to Kroksjö dam measuring G. 60 cubits long, 15 wide at the bottom, 6 high and 6 wide on top, and then through Kroksjö river to Stendammen measuring D.\nThe land was distributed between the villages in the 1816 land transfer (with adjustment in 1837). The map shows no noticeable difference from the 1750 map, except that a stream is seen connecting Torrgårdsvatten with Rödvatten (no dam was drawn, but neither was the dam at Stendammen). In 1780 Wenngren had sold the mill, which then had financial problems. This may have led to reduced maintenance of the dam, so water could once again flow to Rödvatten.\nDuring the late 1830s, when the mill was run by J.N. Peterson and J.P. Wedelin, work was undertaken to raise the water level at Torrgårdsvatten by damming the outlet to Rödvatten. There is no indication in the documents that there was any previous dam at this location (a transcript is available in a document from 1939). The owners of the land that was to be flooded were compensated according to an agreement from 1839: The farms in the village of Svenseröd were to receive four riksdaler per year for each whole homestead, while Yttre Åsen was to receive a barrel of so-called meat salt every year, both agreements were to apply \"for everlasting times\". The owner of the Lund homestead in Ucklum socken, whose mill was powered by water from Rödvatten, was also compensated. In 1841 the work was completed, but the water level had risen more than the landowners had anticipated. For this reason, the surveyor Carl S. Jung was called in to map the lake when the ice had settled in January 1842 (the water level was then 1.2 meters below the upper edge of the dam). The result was 38.1 hectares, which Jung compared with the 1816 map: the lake had grown by 7.2 hectares. The flooded area was \"cultivated forest land on bedrock and partly of marshes and seagulls with some smaller grass slopes to Yttre Åsen\". The southern end of the lake had been moved about 160 meters to the south, and the peninsula in the northern part of the lake was also cut off and is now an island. In connection with the negotiations, a complaint was also received from the owner of the Röd homestead with a saw that received its water from Rödvatten. This saw had received less water when the connection between Torrgårdsvatten and Rödvatten was severed. On June 9, 1842, the decision was made in which the previous agreements with Svenseröd and Yttre Åsen were declared reasonable while the demands of Röd were rejected.\nThe Torrgårdsvatten dam and the canal to Helgesjön are still visible.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"Ladda ner data från Svenskt vattenarkiv – Ackumulerade delavrinningsområden (SVAR 2010)” (Esri Shape).

        "content": "Fernando Mendes (died 15 November 1724) was a Portuguese Jewish physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMendes was born of Jewish parentage in the province of Beira, Portugal. He graduated M.D. at Montpellier in December 1667, and became physician to John IV of Portugal. When Catherine of Braganza was on her way to England to become the wife of Charles II, she was attacked during her journey through New Castile with erysipelas, and Mendes was sent to her assistance. He gained such favour with the princess that she made him a member of her household, and desired him to accompany her to England and settle there. Mendes reached this country on 25 October 1669, and was appointed physician in ordinary to the queen. He was one of the many physicians in regular attendance on Charles II in his last illness. By the charter of James II he was created a fellow of the College of Physicians, and was admitted on 12 April 1687, but at the accession of William and Mary his name was removed from the roll. Mendes died in London on 15 Nov. 1724 (Hist. Reg. vol. ix., Chron. Diary, p. 48). By his wife, Miss Marques, he had a son James (d. 1739), and a daughter Catherine (named after the queen, who acted as godmother), born about 1678 in the royal palace of Somerset House (Gent. Mag. 1812, pt. i. p. 22). Moses Mendes, the dramatist, was his grandson.\nMendes's only published work was his thesis for the degree of M.D., entitled ‘Stadium Apollinare, sive Progymnasmata medica, ad Monspeliensis Apollinis Laurum consequendam,’ 4to, Lyons, 1668. Prefixed is his portrait engraved by N. Regnesson. A letter in Portuguese from him to John Mendes da Costa, dated 1663, is among the Additional MSS. in the British Museum (No. 29868, f. i.)\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Goodwin, Gordon (1894). \"Mendes, Fernando\".

        "content": "The Ocean Globe Race (OGR) 2023 is the 50th-anniversary celebration of the original Whitbread Round the World Race (WRTWR), the first fully crewed round-the-world race in 1973. It was founded by Australian adventurer and circumnavigator, Don McIntyre. It features yachts similar to those used at that time. Except for safety equipment, no modern technology is allowed. The Ocean Globe Race (OGR) set sail with 14 teams on September 10, 2023, from Ocean Village in Southampton (UK), to circumnavigate the globe with 3 stopovers: Cape Town (South Africa), Auckland (New Zealand), and rounding Cape Horn, Punta del Este (Uruguay), before returning to Cowes (Isle of Wight, UK) in April 2024.\n\n\n== Ranking and Results ==\nThe main prize is the The Ocean Globe Race Winners perpetual IRC Trophy awarded to the yacht with the lowest IRC corrected sailing time. Other prizes are the IRC prizes per class (Flyer, Sayula and Adventure), the Line Honours prize (first boat without considering handicap) and the Spirit of the OGR prize, attributed to the most deserving entrant across the fleet. \nBy winning leg 1 and leg 2, Translated 9 is the yacht that won more so far in the Ocean Globe Race. Translated 9 is co-skippered by Marco Trombetti (also shipowner), Vittorio Malingri, Simon Curwen, and Nico Malingri. Translated 9 retired on the third leg due to damage to the hull, but managed to repair it and join the fourth leg just in time. After leading leg 4 they abbandoned the leg due to the same hull problem. Triana, the french boat skippered by the entrepreneur and sailor Jean d’Arthuys, won the 3rd leg and it is currently leading the IRC overall ranking. Leg 4 is currently underway.\n\nLine Honours\nLine Honours (real-time) rewards the fastest boat in the fleet without considering the different shapes of the yachts. Leg 1 was won  by Spirit of Helsinki, skippered by Jussi Paavoseppä, Leg 2 was won by Translated 9, co-skippered by Marco Trombetti and Vittorio Malingri, Leg 3 and Leg 4 was won by Pen Duick VI, skippered by Marie Tabarly.\n\n\n== Classes ==\nThe yachts are divided into 3 classes: Flyer, which includes yachts previously entered in 1973, 1977, or 1981 WRTWR, or of 'relevant' historic significance and 'approved' production-built, ocean-certified, sail-training yachts generally 55 ft to 68 ft LOA; Sayula (56.1 ft-66 ft); Adventure (47 ft-56 ft).\n\n\n== The fleet - entrants ==\nAt the start, the fleet consists in 14 teams from France, Italy, Spain, Finland, the UK, the US, South Africa, and Australia, with approximately a 30% quota of female sailors. Flyer Class: Translated 9 (Italy), Pen Duick VI (France), Maiden (UK), L’Esprit D’Equipe (France), Neptune (France). Sayula Class: Evrika (France), Spirit of Helsinki (Finland), White Shadow (Spain), Explorer (Australia). Adventure Class: Triana (France), Outlaw (Australia) Sterna  (South Africa), Godspeed (USA), Galiana WithSecure (Finland).\n\n\n== Rules ==\nEach crew consists of at least of 70% non-professional sailors, one woman and one sailor under 24 years old. For this reason, the OGR is defined as a global adventure for ordinary sailors on standard yachts. A distinctive feature of the OGR is the limited use of modern technology on board: computers, satellites, GPS, and high-tech materials are prohibited. Teams navigate using sextants and receive weather forecasts through radio fax. The OGR is considered a testament to human endeavor, emphasizing team spirit and sheer determination.\n\n\n== Organisers ==\nDon McIntyre is the founder and Race Director of the Ocean Globe Race. He is also the organiser of the Golden Globe Race 2022, which was awarded the title of '‘Event of the Year’ at the British Yachting Awards 2023.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Wilkin County Museum in Breckenridge, Minnesota, is a local history museum focusing on the history of Wilkin County. The museum is also the home of the Wilkin County Historical Society.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Wilkin County Historical Society organized on March 29, 1965, in order to create a museum. In the beginning with no central place to store items, the museums artifacts were spread to different places around town until the First Federal Savings and Loan in Breckenridge offered their basement to centralize storage of the collection until a building for a museum could be found.In 1976 they moved to the law enforcement center. A year later, they purchased the former Masonic Temple building in Breckenridge for $1 and began moving their artifacts into the building that was built in 1949. A grand opening of the museum held May 20, 1979. In their first year of operation, the Society moved a schoolhouse in Brushvale, Minnesota, to Welles Memorial Park in Breckenridge for use as another museum. The new schoolhouse location saw 1,000 visitors in its first year. The museum is primarily funded through the county's tax levy, along with memberships and donations.\n\n\n== Collection ==\nThe museum has eight rooms furnished as period rooms, including a living room, hospital room, small chapel, and a replica of an old bank teller station. On the lower level is a bedroom, bathroom, pioneer kitchen and laundry room, in addition to many pieces of small farm equipment and farm machines, plus countless other smaller exhibit items. Te museum also has a bridal display and a large display of military memorabilia.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of museums in Minnesota",

        "content": "On July 4, 2009, clashes broke out between Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and Malian forces near Araouane, Mali.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn June 11, 2009, AQIM jihadists assassinated Malian officer Lamana Ould Bou in his home in Timbuktu. Malian forces launched an offensive against AQIM in retaliation for the assassination on June 16, near Garn-Akassa, killing sixteen to twenty-six jihadists.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nOn July 3, 2009, American intelligence alerted Malian officials to a drug trafficking convoy in rural northern Tombouctou Region. Hamma Ould Mohamed Yahya, the Malian deputy commander in Tombouctou Region, organized a patrol of seventy men on twelve pick-ups to intersect the convoy. The trafficker's vehicle was spotted by the Malian forces, but managed to escape, although Malian forces killed a machine gunner. Between 3 and 4am the following night, around forty AQIM jihadists ambushed the Malian soldiers.\nThe Malian government did not release any information about the ambush, only announcing \"very deadly skirmishes\" and that \"losses were recorded on both sides.\" Survivors of the battle stated that \"of the twelve army vehicles, six were destroyed with their occupants, and the other six were scattered in the desert. We don't yet know who is alive and who is dead.\" Jeune Afrique reported that the ambush was conducted by AQIM and affiliated drug traffickers. Sixteen Malian soldiers were killed and twenty were taken prisoner, including Yahya. Between one and twenty jihadists were killed as well.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAQIM claimed responsibility for the ambush on July 8, and claimed the deaths of twenty-eight Malian soldiers and capture of three others. AQIM also claimed one Mauritanian within their ranks was killed. Yahya was released in March 2012.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Serkan Ramanlı is a Kurdish lawyer and politician from Batman.\n\n\n== Early years and education ==\nHe was born in 1980 in Batman. He graduated from Van Yüzüncü Yıl University Faculty of Letters and Konya Selçuk University Faculty of Law. Ramanlı, who was registered with the Batman Bar Association, took part in the management of the bar association. He is married and has two children.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nRamanlı became a member of the general administration board of the Free Cause Party and later the deputy chairman in charge of public relations and promotion. In the 2023 general elections, he was elected as a Batman deputy.\nRamanlı announced his intention to open the \"Bediüzzeman Institute\", an Islamic school with multiple campuses, which teaches entirely in the Kurdish language, as well as to employ Kurds as teachers, saying \"within the framework of the Bediüzzaman Institute, we will bring together the leading personalities raised in Kurdish history, from our first companion Jaban al-Kurdi, to Saladin, from there to Sheikh Ubeydullah, Mahmud Barzanji, and from Sheikh Said to Mustafa Barzani, with our youth and people. We will make them know and love them. However, we will bring together the pioneers of Kurdish literature with our people. What kind of history did the Kurds come from? We want them to know what kind of civilization basin they grew up in. Unfortunately, the number of people in our society who know this today are small enough to be counted with a finger.\"\nRamanlı emphasised the need for dialogue and cooperation between the Free Cause Party and DEM Party. He was seen at a Batman Petrolspor match alongside the DEM Party's Batman candidate Mehdi Öztütün. Öztütün was expelled from the DEM Party after the pictures surfaced, and Ramanlı reacted by saying \"I want Ms. Tülay to put an end to this. I know that DEM Party voters are also very seriously uncomfortable with this, on behalf of the people of Batman.\" Ramanlı also described Tuncer Bakırhan as his \"family friend.\"\nIn the 2024 Turkish local elections, he ran for mayor of Batman. Also in the 2024 elections, Abdullah Zeydan of the DEM Party was elected as mayor of Van, although Turkish authorities appointed Abdulahat Arvas of the AKP as mayor instead. Ramanlı criticised Turkish authorities for the decision and claimed that Zeydan was the legitimate mayor of Van.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "James Hunter Lane, sometimes called Hunter Lane, (1806/7 – 23 June 1853) was a Scottish physician, surgeon and medical writer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLane was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons, Edinburgh, in 1829, and graduated M.D. at Edinburgh University in 1830. He was honorary physician to the Cholera Hospital, Liverpool, during 1831-2, and physician to the Lock Hospital of the Infirmary there in 1833. In 1834 he collaborated with James Manby Gully in a translation of ‘A Systematic Treatise on Comptarative Physiology,' by Professor Frederic Tiedemann of Heidelberg, 2vols. 8vo. In 1840 he was appointed senior physician of the Lancaster Infirmary, and in the same year brought out his ‘Compendium of Materia Medica and Pharmacy, adapted to the London Pharmacopœia, embodying all the new French, American, and Indian Medicines, an also comprising a summary of Practical Toxicology,' a work of considerable value in its day. He was shortly afterwards elected president of the Royal Medical Society of Edinburgh. For the last few years of his life Lane resided at 58 Brook Street, Grosvenor Square, and had an excellent London practice. He died at Brighton on 23 June 1853.\nBesides the works mentioned, Lane contributed numerous articles to the medical papers, and for some time edited the ‘Liverpool Medical Gazette' and the ‘Monthly Archives of the Medical Science.' He is said also (Med. Direct. 1853) to have written an ‘Epitome of Practical Chemistry,'\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Seccombe, Thomas (1892). \"Lane, Hunter\".

        "content": "On July 22, 2010, French and Mauritanian forces launched a raid on an Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) base in Tombouctou Region, Mali, in an attempt to rescue French hostage Michel Germaneau. The forces were able to destroy the base, but Germaneau was not rescued and later executed by AQIM.\n\n\n== Background ==\nBetween April 19 and April 22, 2010, French national Michel Germaneau and his driver were kidnapped by jihadists from Abdelhamid Abou Zeid's katiba, part of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). The driver was released on April 29, but Germaneau was kept by the jihadists for several months. On July 11, AQIM threatened to execute Germaneau within fifteen days if two AQIM officials; one held in an Algerian jail and Rachid Ramda, were not released.\n\n\n== Raid ==\nOn July 22, 2010, Mauritanian special intervention groups supported by French Action Division paratroopers raided an AQIM camp in rural Tombouctou Region in Mali, around 150 kilometers from the Mauritanian border. Malian President Amadou Toumani Touré was not informed of the raid beforehand, as he wasn't considered very active in the war against jihadists. Little is known about what occurred during the battle, however it is known that the raid occurred at an AQIM camp near Akla, a village in the desert of Tombouctou. Mauritanian Defense Minister Mohamed Ould Boilil stated that AQIM was preparing an attack on a Mauritanian military barracks in Bassikounou, and that the raid was a preventative measure by the Mauritanians. For the French, the primary objective was to free Germaneau.\nAround ten AQIM fighters were defending the camp at the time of the raid, and they were quickly defeated by a contingent of twenty to thirty French soldiers and an even larger number of Mauritanians. Germaneau was not present at the base at the time of the raid. Two residents of Timbuktu were arrested by Mauritanian soldiers as well, but released a few days later. Boilil stated that six jihadists were killed in the raid and one injured, as well as four others fleeing. Explosives, weaponry, and \"means of communications\" were seized from the camp. Boilil also stated that no Mauritanian soldiers were killed or injured in the battle, thanking French intelligence and assistance. The deaths of six fighters were confirmed by AQIM emir Abdelmalek Droukdel several days later. Droukdel also claimed that the raid occurred during negotiations for Germaneau's release, which French authorities denied.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nOn July 25, AQIM published an audio recording announcing the execution of Germaneau in response to the raid on Akla. A Malian official stated that Germaneau was executed in front of Droukdel, but French Prime Minister François Fillon called those statements \"inexact.\" French journalist Jean-Dominique Merchet claimed that Germaneau was not executed, and instead died of a lack of heart medication.\nA Malian intermediary in negotiations for Germaneau's release, however, stated that a French national was indeed executed in retaliation for the raid. This was clarified from a confession by Tunisian AQIM fighter Bechir Bessnoun during a foiled attack. Bessnoun stated that Germaneau was executed with a bullet to the head in Adrar Tigharghar of the Adrar des Ifoghas of Mali. The executioner was Hamada Ag Hama, on the orders of Abou Zeid and Djamel Okacha.\nThe raid was seen as a serious failure by the Élysée and the Action Division. Germaneau's body was never found, but his passport was discovered by Chadian soldiers in Adrar Tigharghar during the Battle of Tigharghar.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Legwale was a kgosi of the Kwena tribe in the late 18th century. He was preceded by his father Seitlhamo and succeeded by his brother Maleke as regent. Gary Okihiro has contested the idea that Legwale is a single individual, saying that there were two consecutive dikgosi named Legwale who were father and son.\n\n\n== Life ==\nLegwale was the son of the Kwena kgosi Seitlhamo. As a young man, it's believed that Legwale led the Kwena people in a war with the Kgafela people in a failed attempt to reinstate Makgotso as the Kgafela tribe's regent. Legwale was briefly captured during this conflict.\nUpon Seitlhamo's death, Legwale became the kgosi. As kgosi, Legwale led a raiding party to steal cattle. This has been reported as a raid against the Birwa people in Shoshong, or against the Shona people in Bonyani. Legwale was killed during the raid. His year of death has been reported as c. 1798 and c. 1803. Because the targets were prepared, and because Legwale was the only member of the party to be killed, rumours developed that Legwale' brothers warned the targets in advance.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nLegwale's sons included Motswasele II and Segokotlo in the great house, Molese in the second house, and his junior son Kgama. As they were still young upon Legwale's death, his brother Maleke became regent. Upon Maleke's death, his brother Tshosa became regent before Motswasele II became kgosi. According to Gary Okihiro, the identification of Legwale as a single figure is an error and there were two consecutive dikgosi named Legwale, Legwale I and his son Legwale II.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nde Jongh, M.; de Beer, F.

        "content": "On 28 March 2024, a passenger bus crashed near Mmamatlakala in Limpopo, the northernmost province of South Africa, killing 45 people and leaving an eight-year-old girl, who sustained serious injuries, as the sole survivor. According to the South African Department of Transport, the incident occurred when the driver lost control. The bus went over a bridge and then caught on fire. The bus was transporting Easter pilgrims from Gaborone, Botswana, to Moria, South Africa.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSouth Africa has one of the most developed road networks in Africa but one of the worst safety records. During the four-day-long Easter weekend in 2023, the country recorded 185 fatal automobile incidents that resulted in 225 fatalities. In a statement made hours before the crash, President Cyril Ramaphosa urged South Africans to take caution on the roads during the Easter weekend, stating that the event \"does not have to be a time where we sit back and wait to see statistics on tragedy or injuries on our roads.\"The Zion Christian Church, the largest denomination in southern Africa, is headquartered in Moria and attracts millions of Christians from South Africa and surrounding countries with its annual Easter pilgrimages. The 2024 pilgrimage was the first in the town since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n== Crash ==\nThe bus had a Botswana licence plate and had been carrying pilgrims from the St. Engenas Zion Christian Church in Molepolole, around an hour from Gaborone, who were headed for an Easter church service in Moria. It had a total of 46 occupants and was travelling on the regional route 518 through the Kloof Pass, a mountainous route that contains numerous tight bends. Initial information suggested the driver had missed the turn-off for the much smoother N11 national route.The bus fell off the side of the Mma Matlakala Bridge, in Mmamatlakala between Mokopane and Marken, and into the ravine, catching fire after impact on a rocky surface about 50 metres (160 ft) under the bridge. The South African Transport Ministry said the driver lost control of the bus, which caused it to collide with barriers and go off the side of the bridge. It was also pulling a trailer, according to rescue workers, adding additional weight. The fire involved gas canisters, which many passengers were carrying to use for cooking. Surviving passengers were trapped in the wreckage but could not be reached quickly by rescuers before they were burnt alive.Rescue operations commenced and continued until the late evening hours.\n\n\n== Casualties ==\nForty-five people died in the crash. The sole survivor, an eight-year-old girl, was hospitalized with serious injuries. She had been accompanied by her grandmother, who died, and was later reported to be in stable condition, with minor lacerations to her arms, legs, head and back. The driver and passengers were all citizens of Botswana. The girl was released on 3 April and repatriated to Botswana by air accompanied by her mother.Some of the bodies were burned beyond recognition, while others were hard to reach due to debris scattered over the crash scene. One woman died after being airlifted from the scene. As of 29 March, 34 bodies had been recovered from the scene, only nine of them identifiable. Autopsies on the victims were conducted on 2 April.\n\n\n== Responses ==\nPresident Ramaphosa sent condolences to Botswanan President Mokgweetsi Masisi, and pledged support to the nation. Masisi sent two cabinet ministers to South Africa to support the families of the victims. South African Transport Minister Sindisiwe Chikunga travelled to the scene of the crash, where she called for responsible driving during the Easter weekend and offered thoughts and prayers for the victims' families. She added that the South African government would assist in repatriating the corpses to Botswana and hold a full inquiry. Botswanan Foreign Minister Lemogang Kwape called the incident a catastrophe, and said that he had received a call from his South African counterpart Naledi Pandor to update him about the situation. On 2 April, national health minister Joe Phaahla and his provincial counterpart Phophi Ramathuba visited the sole survivor of the crash at Mokopane Hospital. Phaahla described her survival as \"miraculous\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nTransport in South Africa\n2023 Venice bus crash\n2020 Centane bus crash\n2018 Chongqing bus crash\nSol Plaatje Dam bus crash\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBus plunges from bridge into ravine in South Africa – video (video of the aftermath of the crash by The Guardian)",

        "content": "The Minsk Castle (Belarusian: Мінскі замак, romanized: Minski zamak) was a wooden defensive structure in Minsk, built in the mid-11th century on the right bank of the Svislach river at its confluence with the Nyamiha river (in the area of March 8 Square); destroyed in the early 19th century, and ultimately leveled by the Soviet authorities in the 1950s. The area formerly surrounded by castle ramparts received the name Zamczysko.\n\n\n== Research status ==\nThe Minsk Castle was built on a natural island where the Nyamiha river flows into the Svislach river. The Nyamiha river has survived to this day in the form of a small stream, enclosed in concrete collectors. The castle grounds were located near the present-day March 8 Square. Currently, the Victors Avenue runs alongside it.\nMentions of the Minsk Castle include notes from the Moscow merchant Trifon Korobeynikov from 1593 and correspondence between Tsar Alexis of Russia and the Moscow voivodes appointed by him for the Lithuanian cities during the Russo-Polish War of 1654–1667. Plans of the castle from the 18th to 19th centuries have been preserved, marking the location of fragments of the rampart. In the 1950s, before the construction of the Park Avenue thoroughfare (now Victors Avenue), traces of the old street system were visible.\nArchaeological excavations on the site of today's March 8 Square, located on a small hill measuring 75×45 meters, began in the mid-20th century. They were conducted in several stages: from 1945 to 1951 and from 1957 to 1961, as well as in 1976. The research revealed that the city was initially planned as a fortress to protect the borders. Previous analysis of the cultural layers of the rampart did not show any human presence in this area before the construction of the castle in the second half of the 11th century. Dendrochronological studies of the beams, which reinforced the rampart, allowed the determination of the time of the first buildings on this site to the year 1063. In 1949, at a depth of 1.5 meters near the present-day House of Physical Culture of the DSO Trudovyje rezerwy, remnants of a temple were discovered in the eastern part of the castle. Scientists date its construction using the stratigraphic method to the years 1071–1085. There is no mention in any written sources that there was a Christian temple in Minsk in the 11th century.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMinsk first appeared in written sources in the Primary Chronicle under the year 1067. It belonged to the Principality of Polotsk. On the right bank of the Svislach river, at the confluence of the Nyamiha River, a wooden castle was built in the second half of the 11th century, intended to serve as a defensive fortification for the southern borders of the state of Vseslav of Polotsk. For unknown reasons, however, the construction was never completed. The castle was surrounded by a rampart, with some sections reaching over 10 meters in height. The castle's defenses also included a moat filled with water.\nIn the 12th and 13th centuries, a town began to form around the castle – in the southern, southwestern, and southeastern directions; the defensive stronghold consisted of 80–82 houses and around 400–500 residents. By the late 15th and early 16th centuries, the castle possessed a considerable number of cannons and other similar weaponry. According to the Bychowiec Chronicle, in 1505, the castle repelled an invasion by the Tatars led by Meñli I Giray, while the city itself was burned.\nThe 16th century saw the development of the city. The areas around the castle were developed into a crafts and trade posad. On the adjacent hill, to the south of the castle, a new center of economic and cultural life emerged – the High Market, with a town hall erected at its center. The favorable location of the new district, away from the marshy areas around the castle hill, provided greater opportunities for Minsk's economic development and diminished the significance of the castle. By the mid-16th century, the Minsk Castle was merely a part of the urban public space. Within its grounds were buildings such as residential houses, the Nativity of the Theotokos Church, warehouses, stables, and a prison housed in one of the towers. The wooden fortifications of the castle were repeatedly destroyed by fires, for example, in 1505, 1547, 1552, 1569, and others. Despite being rebuilt each time, it gradually ceased to fulfill its defensive function.\nAfter the signing of the Union of Lublin in 1569, Minsk became the capital of the Minsk Voivodeship, and the castle buildings were allocated for administrative use. From 1581, sessions of the Supreme Tribunal of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were held at the castle. The sessions lasted for 12 weeks every two years, elevating the city's status to the same level as Novogrudok and Vilnius. Until the mid-17th century, the castle served as the residence of the viceroy of the Grand Duchy. From 1612, the city archive was housed in the castle's judicial building. Documents from the 17th and 18th centuries typically mention the Minsk Castle as the venue for noble sejmiks, yet as late as 1750, it was still garrisoned. In the 17th century, a brick building of the district court (castle court) was erected within the castle, known from drawings by Jazep Drazdovič and photographs from the first half of the 20th century.\nDue to warfare during the conflicts of the 17th and 18th centuries, along with accompanying epidemics, Minsk was nearly completely destroyed and depopulated. During the Russo-Polish War of 1654–1667, the castle and the city were occupied by the forces of Tsar Alexis of Russia from 1655 to 1660. Simultaneously, the city was the theater of Russian military actions led by Ivan Khovansky against the Lithuanians until Minsk was recaptured by the combined Lithuanian-Polish forces in 1660. During the Great Northern War from 1700 to 1721, the castle was successively destroyed by Russian and Swedish forces. In 1778, it was destroyed by fire. The last written record of it appeared in 1793 in a survey conducted by Russian officials after the annexation of Minsk by the Russian Empire following the partitions of Poland. After the partitions of Poland, the castle buildings passed into private hands and underwent degradation.\nUntil the mid-19th century, Zamczysko was one of the commercial centers of Minsk. At the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, the area around the former castle saw the expansion of urban transportation lines. As a result of clearing the area after the castle, only the ramparts remained. In 1931, a square called March 8 Square was built on the former castle grounds. In the second half of the 20th century, during archaeological excavations, the castle hill was excavated, and the soil was removed beyond the city limits. To this day, remnants of the oldest cultural layer, protected by the Belarusian state, have survived.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Defensive constructions ===\nThe castle was situated on a small elongated hill. The castle grounds were surrounded by the left branch of the Nyamiha river from the southeast. Presumably, it was called Mienka or Mień and no longer exists today. The Svislach river flowed from the east. From the north, west, and southwest, as indicated by a plan from 1773, the castle hill was protected by marshy and swampy areas. Based on archaeological research, it was determined that the castle was only a fragment of a fortified settlement located on a relatively flat part of the hill.\nThe strategic location of the Minsk Castle on a natural island was reinforced by an artificial embankment, built of sand and stabilized with wooden structures made of logs. The construction of the embankment was carried out in two stages. Initially, its width was 14 m, which was later increased to 22–25 m, and in some sections, up to 30–32 m. The inner slope was covered with turf. The outer side of the embankment had a slope of 50–52°, while the inner side had a slope of 47°. The inner slope had profiled stairs. The base of the southeastern part of the embankment, near the river, was additionally reinforced with a massive wooden substructure consisting of nine layers of long pine logs, laid closely together perpendicular to the axis of the embankment. Beams were placed between the layers, forming part of the main structure of the embankment.\nThe Minsk Castle was constructed of wood. Its height, along with the embankment, ranged from 13 (embankment height – 8 m, wooden palisade height – 5 m) to 15 m. The castle was surrounded by a water-filled moat. In plan, the castle had a semicircular shape. Its area was 3 hectares. Stretching from the bank of the Svislach to the northeast, it was 270–300 m long, and its width in the middle reached 150 m. The entrance to the castle was a heavily guarded passage 3.4 m wide. The gate was located in the southeastern part of the castle. On the left side, it was concealed by the forward-leaning embankment, which reduced the impact force in case of artillery fire. Presumably, there were two towers on either side of the gate, built in the second half of the 11th century. According to plans from 1773, the castle embankment had two openings for entrance gates: from the north and from the southeast. The southeastern gate passed through the Great Street (later Staro-Miasnicka). In plans from 1793 and 1797, the embankment already had three openings. Another gate was built in its northern part.\n\n\n=== Internal planning ===\nThe central area within the castle walls was intersected by streets measuring 3–4 m in width, running towards the castle gate. Their branches led to residential buildings. The streets were paved with logs, perpendicular to longitudinal beams laid underneath them in 2–3 rows. The main street of the fortress was called Zamkowa and traversed the area inside the castle walls from the southeast to the northwest. It began approximately 300 m from the Svislach river. Over time, it was extended beyond the embankment until it intersected with Wielka Tatarska Street (now Dimitrova; its section outside the walls still exists today), which slightly turned south and served as its continuation. On the other side, Zamkowa Street ended at the height of the later streets Podzamcze and Zawalna, which formed a semicircle from the west. One of the larger streets crossed the eastern part of the castle courtyard in a north–south direction. Its width was 4 m. Smaller lanes branched off from it. During archaeological excavations conducted on this street, a 40-meter section with 13 preserved beams of the wooden pavement was uncovered. Streets such as Podzamcze, Zawalna, its side street, and others within the castle, such as Miasnicka and Wałowa, did not survive.\nThe castle courtyard area was divided into courts enclosed by a palisade made of logs dug into the ground. During excavations, remains of approximately 130 wooden buildings dating from the 11th to the 14th centuries were discovered. Some of the courts had 4–5 outbuildings and 1–2 izba chambers built along the palisade. The open spaces in front of the houses were covered with wooden flooring.\nThe predominant architectural form consisted of single-story log buildings, which comprised 80% of the castle's structures. These buildings typically had one room measuring 16–25 m2. Entrances to the chambers were constructed facing the courtyard. The chambers had wooden floors, placed at a height between the second and third or third and fourth beams. In the izba chambers, clay stoves without chimneys were installed in the corner near the entrance (smoke escaped through window openings or doors), reinforced with a frame made of sticks or straw. Stones formed the base of the stoves. 20% of the internal castle buildings had post-and-beam construction and were used for economic purposes. The lifespan of one building averaged 20–30 years. It was determined that identical buildings were erected in place of destroyed houses and streets were laid out in the same manner. This was a characteristic feature of Minsk's spatial planning.\n\n\n=== Castle temple ===\nIn layers dated to the 11th century, the stone foundation of a temple measuring 12×16 m was discovered. It was located in the eastern part of the castle and had three semicircular apses. In the central part of the temple, the bases of four columns were preserved, opposite which, to the south and north on the inner side of the walls, two rectangular lesenes were uncovered. The temple was built of stones joined with lime mortar. At the southwest corner, fragments of a wall smoothed from the inside with limestone blocks were preserved. The walls of the temple were up to 1.5 m thick. For unknown reasons, the temple was not completed, as evidenced by the lack of a floor and traces of ceilings laid on top of the walls. In the mid-12th century, this place was transformed into a necropolis. 21 burials with remains in wooden coffins were discovered here. In the first half of the 13th century, a street was laid out in this area, and a wooden pavement was laid. Probably, the castle had a second temple. Written sources from the 16th century mention the Soborna Church. Presumably, the record referred to a temple located near the gate and marked on eighteenth-century plans.\nThe architecture of the first Minsk temple was characteristic of the 11th century, as evidenced by the three apses. According to archaeologists, this place of worship has no equivalents among monumental buildings in Rus. For example, the Polotsk temple was built of bricks, like other known oldest temples in Belarus. It is likely that a master from the Romanesque school was invited to Minsk, who used stones bonded with mortar to build the walls. Research indicates that the architect aimed to create a modest temple that would nevertheless be an ornament of the castle and dominate this part of the district. The fact that the Polotsk method of constructing monumental buildings was not adopted as a model suggests that work on the Minsk temple began between 1069 and 1073 when the castle may have belonged to Yaropolk Izyaslavich, the nephew of Casimir I the Restorer. Presumably, Yaropolk maintained close relations with his uncle's court, which influenced the use of the Western model of building religious objects.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\"8 Marta płoszczad'\" (in Russian).

        "content": "Nancy Ross (born 1943) is an American political activist associated with the New Alliance Party. She stood as the party's candidate for Vice President of the United States in the 1984 United States presidential election and later led the New Alliance–affiliated Rainbow Lobby. As of 2024, she is a board member of Independent Voting.\n\n\n== Early life and electoral politics ==\nNancy Ross, a teacher by profession, was a social therapy client and later practitioner. She was elected to New York City's Community School Board No. 3 in 1977. The success of Ross in the school board election jumpstarted the Newmanite movement's interest in electoral politics and, in 1979, Ross helped found the New Alliance Party.\nIn 1981 Ross was an unsuccessful candidate for New York City Council and later stood as the New Alliance Party's candidate in the 1982 New York gubernatorial election. \nIn 1984, seven years after her electoral victory in the school board election, she was selected as the New Alliance candidate for Vice President of the United States, running with the party's presidential nominee Dennis L. Serrette. Though Ross only held the second spot on the New Alliance ticket, Serrette would later describe that campaign staff actually reported to Ross who, in turn, reported to Fred Newman.\n\n\n== Later life and post-electoral activism ==\nRoss later served as executive director of the New Alliance–associated Rainbow Lobby, described in one 1988 newspaper report as \"the fastest growing, independent citizens lobby in America\".\nIn 1992, following the closure of the Rainbow Lobby, Ross co-founded the lobbying firm of Ross and Green with Ann Green. As of 2024, she is a board member of Independent Voting, an umbrella organization of the New Alliance–inspired independent voting movement.\n\n\n== See also ==\nClouds Blur the Rainbow\nLenora Fulani\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n1987 letter from Ross to U.S. Rep.

        "content": "Hypocreopsis lichenoides is part of the family Hypocreaceae and genus Hypocreopsis, fungi that form stromata on the stems of trees and shrubs. The stromata are orange-brown and consist of radiating, perithecial lobes. It is commonly known as willow gloves due to the resemblance of its orange-brown, radiating lobes to rubber gloves, and because it is found on willow stems.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThallus\nUsually single, rarely in groups. Leafy, flat, soft, wide usually to 3,6 cm, rarely to 11 cm and 2–4 (5) mm thick. It consists of radially growing or singular perithecial lobes with finger-like tips on the edge. The surface is light brown through orange-brown or yellow-brown to ochre, with a lighter edge. Young fruiting bodies are smooth, sometimes wrinkled in the middle, mature have many ostioles.\n\nMicroscopic traits\nApothecia dimensions (18–) 22–30 × 6–9 μm, narrowly cylindrical, 8-spored, ascospores in one row, ellipsoid to short-fusiform, 1-septate spores.\n\n\n== Habitat ==\nGrows on branches of Salix aurita, Salix cinerea, was also noted on Prunus padus, Frangula alnus, Sambucus racemosa and others. It is thought to be a parasitic fungus growing on fruiting bodies of Hymenochaete tabacina (willow glue), in Poland it was noted with that fungus, but also on decaying wood with unidentified preexisting white rot, which may or may not have been caused by Hymenochaete tabacina.\n\n\n== Distribution & conservation ==\nHypocreopsis lichenoides is known to grow in North America, Europe, Russia, Japan and Argentine. It's the most frequent in Europe.\nRecent work to raise the profile of willow gloves and conserve them in Great Britain resulted in specimens from the last Scotland locations being translocated carefully to Cumbria, where the fungus was last recorded before its extinction in England about 50 years ago.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHypocreopsis lichenoides  in Index Fungorum\n\n Media related to Hypocreopsis lichenoides at Wikimedia Commons",

Since then, it has expanded to include regular Sunday Masses, devotional practices, and liturgies that incorporate the traditions, feast days, and indults proper to the Philippine islands.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\nThe Hemandad de la Sagrada Eucaristía was founded at the rectory of the Cathedral Parish of Saint Andrew on the 8th of September in 2016 by senior high school students of Saint Andrew's School as a club within that school located in La Huerta, Parañaque City, and it remained so from 2016 until May 2018, when most of its members graduated.\n\n\n=== Later history ===\nThe Hermandad has seen multiple changes in its venue, from transferring from St. Andrew's to San Beda College Alabang, where it stayed until 2023. For some time later, it had conducted Masses in St. James the Great Parish, Muntinlupa City  prior to moving into the Santuario de San Ezekiel Moreno in Las Piñas City, an oratory under the jurisdiction of the Bamboo Organ Church in 2024. Its transfer to the shrine was based on the permission of the Bishop of Parañaque, Most Rev. Jesse E. Mercado, D.D.\nWith the release of Traditionis Custodes, the Hermandad adhered to the guidelines by following the decree of the bishop of Parañaque in the celebration of Masses in the diocese. By working within the guidelines, it kept submission to the authority of the local Ordinary and maintained communion with the universal church.\nThe use of its social media page allowed the Hermandad to grow and promote its activities, which led to an increase in the attendance of its congregation. Most of its attendees are from cities within the Diocese of Parañaque (Parañaque, Muntinlupa, Las Piñas), adjacent provinces (Cavite, Laguna), and several southern Luzon provinces (Quezon, Batangas) being one of the few authorized TLM groups in the south of Metro Manila.\n\n\n=== Foundation of the Latin Mass Society of Cavite ===\nIn 2019, several Cavite based members of the Hermandad spearheaded the organization and approval of a group based in the Diocese of Imus for the celebration of the Traditional Latin Mass. On the 19th of March of the same year, the Latin Mass Society of Cavite was approved under the authority of the Most. Rev. Reynaldo G. Evangelista, D.D. as the duly established group for the TLM in the diocese.\nThe LMS initially had encountered some difficulties in obtaining celebrants for its Masses in the province, leading to a stagnation in its activities. Finally, it was incorporated to the Hermandad as a constituent chapter. One of its annual activities include the accompaniment of the processional image of the Agony in the Garden in the Holy Week procession in Bacoor, Cavite, with its Cavite members in attendance bearing its processional standard.\nFor activities conducted within the province, the group has since operated under the joint name Hermandad de la Sagrada Eucaristía-The Latin Mass Society of Cavite.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nThe Hermandad maintains a regular schedule of Sunday Masses, often in the form of sung Mass (Missa cantata). For this, it has established both sub-groups of altar servers and the schola cantorum. On special occasions, as its founding anniversary, it organizes Solemn High Masses (Missa Solemnis) with both a deacon and subdeacon. Some of the features commonly seen in the Masses of the Hermandad are the continued use of the elevation hymn per Hispanic tradition, the singing of Spanish language hymns, and the use of Spanish styled liturgical vestments. Moreover, the Hermandad has been organizing the recitation of the Divine Office during feast days and livestreaming through its page. With the availability of processional images, the Hermandad also conducts processions to further promote popular piety commonly found in the Philippines.\nOne of its longstanding projects is the translation work of the propers of the Traditional Latin Mass into the Tagalog language. This is conducted by the Comision sa Pagsasalin (Commission on Translation) of the joint Hermandad de la Sagrada Eucaristía-Latin Mass Society of Cavite. Such project is part of its campaign to bring the TLM to the masses in the Philippines by using the vernacular instead of English.\n\n\n== Titular patrons ==\nThe titular patron of the Hermandad, by its very name, is the Most Blessed Sacrament in the Holy Eucharist. Its principal feast day being the Feast of Corpus Christi, where the Hermandad holds a Mass and Eucharistic procession with Benediction. Its principal patroness is Our Lady of Montserrat owing to the Benedictine spirituality it possesses, and she is honored with three (3) feast days.\nIn addition, with its Benedictine spirituality, the Hermandad also has St. Benedict of Nursia as one of its patrons, whose Rule became a basis of the Hermandad's principles. Lastly, Saint Michael the Archangel is also one of the titular patrons due to him being the guardian of the Sacred Liturgy who is mentioned many times in the text of the Tridentine Mass.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Original page link: https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zouk_brasileiro\nO zouk brasileiro é uma dança parceira que começou no Brasil no início dos anos 1990. O zouk brasileiro evoluiu a partir da dança parceira conhecida como Lambada. Com o tempo, os dançarinos de zouk experimentaram e incorporaram outros estilos de música ao zouk, como R'n'B, pop, hip hop e contemporâneo.\n\n\n== História ==\nO zouk brasileiro evoluiu a partir da dança parceira conhecida como lambada. À medida que o gênero musical Lambada saiu de moda, os dançarinos da Lambada recorreram ao zouk caribenho (do francófono, Ilhas do Caribe) como sua música preferida. Foi essa transição que deu origem à dança conhecida como zouk brasileiro. O termo “zouk brasileiro” foi adotado para distinguir o estilo de dança do gênero musical “zouk caribenho”. Hoje em dia o termo \"zouk\" é comumente usado para se referir ao estilo de dança \"zouk brasileiro\".\n\n\n== Estilos ==\nÀ medida que o zouk brasileiro se tornou conhecido na comunidade de dança, dançarinos talentosos e influentes começaram a se desenvolver e explorar para criar estilos mais definitivos, seja pelo simples desenvolvimento como uma escola de zouk, ou pela fusão do zouk com outros estilos de dança, como bachata, salsa, tango argentino, contato improvisação ou swing da costa oeste.\nA partir de 2019, dois dos ramos mais populares do zouk brasileiro são o Tradicional (Rio) e o Lamba. Vários estilos de zouk brasileiro evoluíram e as danças continuam a evoluir à medida que o zouk ganha popularidade em todo o mundo. Os estilos apresentados em escolas de dança fora do Brasil incluem:\n\nZouk tradicional (ou zouk carioca) é um estilo de zouk brasileiro que pode ser tanto linear quanto circular, e contém um conjunto de elementos ou padrões básicos que são conhecidos por um determinado nome (em português), como Viradinha ou Elástico.\nLamba zouk (ou zouk lambada, ou estilo Porto Seguro) tem a ligação mais próxima com a lambada. Caracteriza-se por um movimento constante e ininterrupto, ao contrário do estilo Tradicional.\nMzouk é o único estilo originado fora do Brasil em Maiorca, Espanha. Mzouk define seus passos e movimentos básicos por nomenclatura, em vez de padrões predefinidos. Isto significa que os padrões podem ser definidos como uma sequência de movimentos específicos.\nSoulzouk é o estilo zouk criado no Rio de Janeiro por uma dançarina de zouk chamada China (agora escrita \"Xina\"). Soulzouk se baseia na biomecânica dos movimentos corporais e também na compreensão mútua para se ter uma dança mais orgânica e natural; tanto o líder quanto o seguidor participam ativamente na criação da dança. No início, Soulzouk era visto como uma forma diferente de dançar Zouk porque usava abraço próximo e mais conexão. Naquela época era algo visto com muitos julgamentos por estar fora dos hábitos da cena dançante.\nZouk flow criado por Arknjo há 20 anos no Rio de Janeiro, é um estilo influenciado pela cultura das danças urbanas. Tal utiliza uma sinergia hip-hop e é natural caracterizar movimentos por parte deste corpo energético para criar passos.\nNeozouk é um estilo de movimentos basicamente circulares e uma filosofia sobre a gestão energética destes, desenvolvido pela DJ, dançarina, professora e produtora Mafie Zouker, do Rio de Janeiro e sua parceira Ruanita Santos, hoje radicada na Holanda\n\n\n== Recepcao no exterior ==\nEmbora a forma de dança Zouk se originou no Brasil, não é tão tipicamente dançada lá como outras formas populares, como o Forro ou o Samba. Enquanto Zouk está enraizado em uma mistura de formas musicais e de dança brasileiras e africanas (principalmente Lambada, uma dança que foi popularizada no Brasil na década de 80), é cada vez mais popular fora do Brasil. A maioria dos eventos Zouk que ocorrem fora do Brasil ocorrem na Europa e nos Estados Unidos, mas também ocorrem na Ásia e na América Latina. Os eventos bem conhecidos do Zouk incluem as competições brasileiras Zouk “Jack e Jill”, que são organizadas em todo o mundo pelo Conselho Brasileiro de Dança Zouk (BZDC, Brazilian Zouk Dance Council), o Congresso Internacional Zouk, e vários festivais nacionais do Zouk, que ocorrem em todo o mundo. Alguns dos dançarinos Zouk mais conhecidos incluem Kadu Pires & Larissa Thayane Frisbee (ambos brasileiros), Anderson Mendes & Brenda Carvalho (brasileiro e brasileira-peruana), Renata Peçanha (brasileira), William Teixera & Paloma Alves (brasileiro-espanhol e brasileira), e outrxs. \n\n\n== Referências ==\n\n\n== Ligações externas ==\n\"Zoukology\".\n\"History of Zouk\".\n\"Mzouk USA\".

She was elected to serve on the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IAHCR) from 2024 through to the end of 2027.\n\n\n== Life ==\nMees was born in Suriname's capital Paramaribo and she graduated with a masters degree in law from the Anton de Kom University of Suriname in 2000,\nShe worked at the Anton de Kom University of Suriname lecturing on human rights law. Her country proposed that she should be a candidate to be elected to the IACHR. As part of the process an independent panel led by Claudia Martin of the American University Washington College of Law looked at all of the prospective candidates in a year when there would be four new IACHR members. The panel were concerned that so many of the candidates were withdrawn. Some of those elected met the criteria, but de Mees failed to meet expertise with the IACHR human rights standards and the panel questioned her \"independence, impartiality, and absence of conflicts\".\n\nShe was elected by the OAS's General assembly to serve from the beginning of 2024 through to the end of 2027. She succeeded the Jamaican lawyer Margarette May Macaulay as the Rapporteur on Rights of Women and Rapporteur on the Rights of People of African Descent and against Racial Discrimination. She was one of three new commissioners, including Andrea Pochak, replacing long serving commissioners Macauley, Julissa Mantilla Falcón and Esmeralda Arosemena de Troitiño. The initial President of the  Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) will be Roberta Clarke who is a commissioner from Trinidad.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n Media related to Gloria Monique de Mees at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "The 2nd North Carolina Union Volunteer Infantry Regiment was a military unit in the Union Army during the American Civil War recruited from coastal counties in North Carolina. The Regiment was made up of Southern Unionists and deserters from the Confederate Army. After being captured in the Battle of New Bern by Confederate forces under General George Pickett, 22 soldiers of the 2nd Volunteers were executed as Confederate deserters in February 1864. \n\n\n== History ==\nAfter Union General Ambrose Burnside captured parts of the North Carolina coast during his 1861–1862 campaign, he authorized the recruitment of local North Carolina troops for the Union army in May 1862. The 1st North Carolina Union Volunteer Infantry Regiment was formed in June 1862, and the 2nd Regiment US Volunteers was formed in November 1863 at New Bern, North Carolina. The 2nd Regiment had a total strength of 350 men in 5 companies. Unlike most Civil War Regiments, the different companies of the 1st & 2nd North Carolina Volunteers did not operate as a combined regiment, the companies were sent on assignments separately. \nBeaufort, North Carolina was a recruiting center for the 2nd Regiment. 92 men of the 2nd Volunteer Regiment had formerly been in Confederate service.  Confederate prisoners of war were enticed to join after swearing a loyalty oath to the Union, and Confederate deserters were also recruited to join the US volunteer regiments. Union Major General John J. Peck complained about the quality of the North Carolina recruits: \"Some of these officers...enlist all the men they can possibly persuade, without the slightest regard to their capacity, either mental or physical.\" Peck was also  concerned about \"virtual impressment and fraudulent enlistment,\" in the 1st & 2nd North Carolina Regiments, including the recruitment of underage and over-age soldiers. \nCompany F of the 2nd Regiment took part in the Battle of New Bern in February 1864, where several men were captured and later executed, and Companies B and E fought at the Siege of Plymouth, on April 17–20, 1864. Several companies of the 2nd Regiment were assigned to garrison duty at Fort Macon and Beaufort. The 2nd Regiment was merged with the 1st North Carolina Volunteer Regiment on February 27, 1865, and the combined unit was  mustered out of service in the summer of 1865.\n\n\n== Execution of 2nd North Carolina troops by Confederates ==\nAt the 1864 Battle of New Bern, Company F of the 2nd Volunteer Regiment was tasked with holding an isolated outpost.  On February 1, Confederate troops under General Robert Hoke attacked their position, and the Union troops surrendered.\n53 men from Company F were taken prisoner. Several of the North Carolinians were recognized by Confederate troops with whom they had previously served, and General George Pickett was alerted that Confederate deserters were among the prisoners. \nTreatment of Confederate deserters in North Carolina had previously been lenient. Desertion was not a crime under North Carolina law, and the Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court, Richmond Mumford Pearson, believed that conscription was unconstitutional. Pearson generally granted writs of habeas corpus to North Carolina conscripts and deserters who appealed to the court. \nThe captured men had been members of North Carolina Partisan Ranger companies or railroad guard units, and not in regular Confederate Army service. These local irregular units were consolidated in October 1863 into the 66th Regiment North Carolina State Troops. Members of the companies being consolidated were offered the choice of voluntarily joining the 66th or being subject to Confederate conscription, which would have placed them either in the 66th or another regiment. Under the reasoning that the Union prisoners had been subject to conscription and had deserted to the enemy, General Pickett ordered that they should be court-martialed as deserters and punished with execution if found guilty. \nThe prisoners were taken to the town of Kinston, North Carolina and held in the local jail. They were court-martialed, and 22 were sentenced to death by hanging. 2 men were hung on February 5, 5 on February 12, 13 on February 15, and 2 on February 22. All of the executed men had been in the Union service less than 90 days. The hangings took place in Kinston under the supervision of Hoke's brigade and in view of the civilian population. These hangings were the only mass execution of deserters by the Confederate army during the war.\nThe remaining 2nd Regiment prisoners were treated as normal prisoners of war. They were sent to POW camps at Richmond, Virginia, and later Andersonville, Georgia, where Union prisoners suffered from outbreaks of disease in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. Three of the remaining captives were paroled from POW camps and released, four have no further records, and 25 died at Andersonville.\n\n\n== Aftermath of the executions ==\nThe killings stirred outrage in the North, Southern newspapers praised Pickett's actions. Morale was severely shaken in both the 1st and 2nd North Carolina Volunteer Regiments, Union General Innis N. Palmer wrote: \"The North Carolina troops I considered useless unless they were placed at some point where they could consider themselves secure from capture, as the execution of the Carolina troops at Kinston had very much demoralized the whole of them. They would have been useless to General Butler, and I have placed them all in the Sub-District of Beaufort, where, as they feel secure, they will, I hope, become reliable.\" \nThe US House of Representatives opened an investigation into the executions in 1866, producing an 89-page report containing Pickett's correspondence on the matter and the findings of their investigation. Pickett feared being prosecuted as a war criminal, he fled to Canada after the war for a year until the US dropped its investigation at the urging of Ulysses S. Grant. Pickett and Hoke were never charged with any crime relating to the killings. \n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of North Carolina Union Civil War units\nNorth Carolina in the American Civil War\nGalvanized Yankees\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Rosyth Dockyard Recreation F.C. was a Scottish association football club, which twice played in the Scottish Cup in the 1930s.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe club, from Rosyth in Fifeshire, was made up of men from the Rosyth naval base.  It was in essence a football-playing sub-section of the Rosyth Recreation athletic club, and the club funded both Junior and Senior sides at various times from 1918 to 1957.  It was also referred to as Rosyth Recreation.\nThe first references to the club come from the 1918–19 season; at the time it was a Junior club and entered the Scottish Junior Cup, reaching the third round in its first season in the competition, albeit after a bye and a walkover.  It won its way through to the third round on merit in 1923–24, the furthest it reached in the competition before the war, and won the West Fife Junior Cup, thanks to a 3–1 home win over Kelty Rangers. It also played in junior leagues in Fife from 1920–21 to 1925–26, without success.The club joined the Scottish Football Association in 1933–34, entitling it to play in the Scottish Qualifying Cup and Fife Cup.  It only played in the latter competition once, in 1934–35, losing its only fixture 2–0 at Dunfermline Athletic.  However, in the club's first attempt in the Qualifying Cup, it won the North section, beating Ross County 4–1 in the final at Pittodrie; Rosyth turned the tie around on the half-hour, Garland and Clusker scoring within a minute to take the club from 1–0 down to 2–1 up, and County's goalkeeper Sherlaw was injured in failing to stop the second.The triumph put the club into the first round of the 1933–34 Scottish Cup, the club then losing at Vale of Leithen.  It also entered the Edinburgh & District League that season, finishing second, 11 points behind runaway winner Penicuik Athletic.\nThe club reached the North final again in 1934–35, losing to Clachnacuddin (again at Pittodrie), but this time the club won its first round tie in the 1934–35 Scottish Cup, 3–1 at Berwick Rangers, despite - or because of - Rangers bringing in players from Newcastle United and Alnwick to bolster the forward line. Rosyth only narrowly went down to Airdrieonians in the second round.  The club was also declared the champion of the Edinburgh & District League, although the league had diminished from 13 clubs to 5, and not all matches were played.The club entered the Qualifying Cup until 1938–39, but never won another tie - its final appearance was a 5–4 defeat at Dunkeld & Birnam.After the Second World War, the club returned to the Junior rank.  It had significant success at local level, winning the Fife Junior League and Cup in 1949–50, and beating Newburgh 8–2 in the final of the Cowdenbeath Junior Cup, at East End Park, Colin Syme and Bobby Simpson both scoring hat-tricks.  In 1950–51, Recreation had its best run in the Scottish Junior Cup, by getting to the sixth round for the only time, where the club lost 1–0 at home to Irvine Meadow XI; its tie with Luncarty in the fifth round had to be replayed, after Luncarty protested successfully against Rosyth's Richard Sharpe being a senior player.  However the club's reliance on the Recreation Club was its downfall; the club announced in 1957 that its playing field was to be closed, and as a result the football club folded.\n\n\n== Colours ==\nThe club wore red and yellow hooped jerseys, white shorts, and red socks.\n\n\n== Ground ==\nThe club played at the Rosyth Recreation Park, where the Reserve Fleet had its athletic games.  The highest attendance was in the Junior Cup 6th round tie against Irvine Meadow in March 1951, with a reputed 5,000 fans travelling from Ayrshire helping to swell the crowd to 8,000.\n\n\n== Notable players ==\nJimmy Smith, the club's goalkeeper in the early 1920s, who later played for Tottenham Hotspur\nDavid Russell, the club's only Junior international, capped in the 1923 match against England at Birmingham City, and who later played for Doncaster Rovers and Leeds United\n\n\n== Honours ==\nScottish Cup\nBest result: 2nd round, 1934–35\nScottish Qualifying Cup (North)\nWinner: 1933–34\nRunner-up: 1934–35\nEdinburgh & District League\nWinner: 1934–35\nRunner-up: 1933–34\nFife County League\nWinner: 1949–50\nFife Junior Cup\nWinner: 1948–49, 1949–50\nWest Fife Junior Cup\nWinner: 1923–24\nCowdenbeath Junior Cup\nWinner: 1949–50\n\n\n== References ==",

According to the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro, Keep's chiton has \"brilliant blue markings on its plates that can only be appreciated with a hand lens\". These small chitons, less than an inch long (18 mm), are usually found in fairly warm water in sandy or rocky tide pools located between Cayucos, California, and the Revillagigedo Islands of Mexico.\nThis species was described to science by S. Stillman Berry in 1948.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Robert Emmett Condon (17 March 1896 – 26 June 1981) was an American military officer who served during three major conflicts and rose from private to major general over the course of his long career. In later life, he served as director of civil defense for New York City.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBorn in Vernon, Texas, Condon attended high school in Amarillo, Texas. He then studied at the Catholic Academy in Shawnee, Oklahoma. After his family moved to Kansas City, Missouri, Condon attended the Kansas City School of Law and Commerce.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter American entry into World War I, Condon enlisted as a private in the United States Army in 1917 and was assigned to the 35th Division. He was promoted to sergeant and then, in March 1918, was commissioned as a second lieutenant of infantry. After completing training, Condon served with the American Expeditionary Forces in France. In October 1918, he was sent with his platoon to the island of Islay in Scotland to assist in the military burials of over four hundred American soldiers who had perished in the accidental sinking of the HMS Otranto.\n\nAfter the Armistice, Condon was assigned to the American Commission to Negotiate Peace in Paris as an aide and secretary to Ambassador Henry White in December 1918. In early 1919, he was promoted to first lieutenant. In November 1919, Condon was relieved from active duty and commissioned as a captain in the Army Reserves.\nReturning to civilian life in the United States, Condon was one of the seventeen co-founders of the United States Junior Chamber of Commerce in 1920. He later served as national president of the organization. Condon also helped establish the American Legion.\nBy 1929, Condon was living in Manhattan. He served as the first chairman of the New York City Traffic Commission. Before American entry into World War II, Condon worked as an industrial engineer for AT&T.\nIn May 1939, a New York jury awarded Condon $8,000 in a civil suit against Cincinnati Reds pitcher Paul Derringer. Condon had sued Derringer for $25,000 over an altercation which had occurred during the 1936 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, where Condon was hosting a reception in his hotel suite for Secretary of War Harry Woodring and others. The jury found Derringer liable, but reduced the amount to be more commensurate with his annual salary. In July 1939, the incident was settled for an undisclosed amount to allow Derringer to participate in the 1939 Major League Baseball All-Star Game at Yankee Stadium without being arrested.\nIn April 1942, Condon was promoted to major and recalled to active duty in the Army Air Forces. He listed his hometown as Larchmont, New York. In July 1942, Condon graduated from the Air Intelligence School at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He then served as a combat intelligence officer for the 98th Bomb Group based in Palestine. Participating in Mediterranean Theatre operations, Condon earned the Distinguished Flying Cross and a Bronze Star Medal. He was also made an honorary officer of the French Foreign Legion.\nPromoted to lieutenant colonel, Condon returned to the United States in March 1943 to serve on the staff of the Air Intelligence School. In September 1943, he was reassigned to the staff of the First Air Force. During the remainder of the war, Condon served in various posts there and was promoted to colonel. He was awarded the Legion of Merit and relieved from active duty in October 1946.\nReturning again to civilian life, Condon became president of the National Economic Mobilization Council. As a member of the Air Force Reserve, he received a five-year appointment as a brigadier general in February 1948. With the outbreak of the Korean War, Condon was recalled to active duty on 15 March 1951 and assigned to the Office of Public Information in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. In April 1952, he became deputy commander for Reserve Affairs at the headquarters of Continental Air Command at Mitchel Air Force Base, Long Island, New York.\nCondon was reappointed brigadier general in March 1953. He was relieved from active duty in 1954 and received a second award of the Legion of Merit. His promotion to major general in the Air Force Reserve was approved in June 1955.\nIn 1955, Condon was appointed director of civil defense by New York City Mayor Robert F. Wagner, who had also served as an Army Air Forces intelligence officer during World War II. At the age of sixty, Condon retired from the Air Force Reserve on 31 March 1956. He continued to hold the post of director of civil defense until Mayor John V. Lindsay took office in January 1966.\n\n\n== Personal ==\nCondon was the son of James Francis Condon. He had a sister.\nOn 23 November 1929, Condon married Gertrude Camille Edwards (27 September 1900 – 29 September 1983) at the Church of St. Augustine in Larchmont, New York. She changed her name to Camille Gertrude Condon after their marriage. They had a daughter and a son.\nAfter his retirement, Condon and his wife lived in Goshen, New York. On 26 June 1981, Condon died at Arden Hill Hospital there. On 7 December 1998, Condon and his wife were interred in Section 65 of Arlington National Cemetery.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sokhan Dictionary (Persian: فرهنگ سخن) is one of the most recent monolingual Persian dictionaries, compiled under the supervision of Hasan Anvari. The dictionary consists of two main editions:\nThe Great Edition (Big Dictionary) in eight volumes.\nThe Compact Edition (Compact Dictionary) in two volumes.\nThe Big Dictionary of Sokhan, in addition to old words, encompasses nearly all words, scientific terms, and contemporary interpretations of the Persian language. It has been compiled and published by Sokhan Publications (fa). In the compilation of the Sokhan Dictionary, besides the editor-in-chief (Hassan Anvari), 46 authors and 21 editors collaborated in both general and specialized sections.\n\n\n== Sokhan Compact Dictionary ==\nThe Sokhan Compact Dictionary, authored under the supervision of Hasan Anvari, is composed of two volumes. This lexicon is a condensed version of the Sokhan Big Dictionary (an eight-volume set). In the Sokhan Compact Dictionary, lexical evidences (except for a few entries) have been omitted. Additionally, rarely used words, especially those with scant evidence and words formed analogically, have been excluded from this dictionary.\nThe purpose of condensing the Sokhan Big Dictionary into a two-volume format is to facilitate access for individuals who do not have access to the larger edition or are seeking concise documentation of words.\n\n\n== Sokhan Contemporary Dictionary ==\nThe Sokhan Contemporary Dictionary is authored in a single volume. Unlike the two main dictionaries, this lexicon does not include archaic words. Instead, its compilation focuses on contemporary Persian vocabulary and expressions. The volume of scientific terms in this edition is also less compared to the two original editions (Big Dictionary and Compact Dictionary). This dictionary, too, has been published by Sokhan Publications. In its compilation, in addition to the editor-in-chief (Hassan Anvari), 46 authors and 21 editors collaborated in both general and specialized sections. The Sokhan Contemporary Dictionary was published in the year 2004 (1383 in the Persian calendar).\n\n\n== Sokhan Supplementary Dictionary ==\nThis book is a supplement to the Sokhan Big Dictionary, which was published in eight volumes in the year 2002 (1381 in the Persian calendar). It comprises words that were omitted or newly discovered, as well as corrections of printing and non-printing errors and mistakes in references that occurred across the eight volumes. Additionally, it includes some new evidence for entries that had limited or no evidence previously.\n\n\n== Features of Sokhan Dictionary ==\nThe Sokhan Dictionary comprises 75,000 main entries, 45,000 sub-entries, 16,000 documented evidences, 1,000 examples, and 1,500 images. It encompasses almost all words used in both ancient and modern Persian language.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "An extended emission-line region (EELR) are giant interstellar clouds ionized by the radiation of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) inside a galaxy or photons produced by the shocks associated with the radio jets. An EELR can appear as a resolved cloud in relative nearby galaxies and as narrow emission lines in more distant galaxies.\n\nEELRs were first discovered in radio galaxies. Usually the clouds emitting the narrow emission lines are restricted to a few kiloparsecs within the AGN, but some galaxies have narrow emission lines that extend a few kiloparsec to over 100 kiloparsecs. These clouds where therefore called extended emission-line regions (EELRs) and usually have a large doubly ionized oxygen [O III]/Hβ ratio, as well as a strong ionized helium He II/Hβ ratio (oxygen line at 5007 Å, helium line at 4686 Å). In some cases these EELRs show highly ionized species, such as  calcium [Ca V] and iron [Fe VII] [Fe X]. Another common highly ionized species is the emission of neon [Ne V] (main line at 3426 Å). This high level of ionization shows that the EELRs must be ionized by a mechanism related to the nucleus of the galaxy. HII regions do not show this high level of ionization. The first [O III] images of EELRs were around galaxies, such as 3C 79, 4C 37.43, NGC 3516 or NGC 4151.\nIn 2009 a large cloud was discovered that had similar spectral features as EELRs, but had no ionizing AGN nearby. It was concluded that the nearby galaxy IC 2497 hosted an AGN in the past. Today this AGN faded into inactivity. The hard ionizing radiation did however need time to travel the thousands of lightyears towards a cloud, which would later become Hanny's Voorwerp. This makes Hanny's Voorwerp the first EELR associated with a fading AGN. Previously EELRs were commonly first discovered via spectroscopy and required high-resolution imaging to further resolve the EELRs. Hanny's Voorwerp was however discovered in broad band imaging from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. This prompted a search for more EELRs in broad-band imaging surveys by galaxy zoo volunteers, who also discovered Hanny's Voorwerp. EELRs are called \"Voorwerpjes\" by the galaxy zoo members. EELRs that are ionized by the AGN of a companion galaxy were also discovered. This type of ionization is called cross-ionization.\nIn broad-band images the [O III] emission lines usually lie at the g-band. The true color of an EELR would be dominated by the [O III] emission, which is a cyan color. In astronomical imaging slightly false-color images that transform g, r and i bands into RGB-images are more common. Sometimes the i-band is replaced with a z-band image. The EELRs appear as blue (g-band) objects in these survey images. Sometimes the H-alpha line is redshifted enough to lie at the i-band, which can make the EELR appear as a blue-violet object in these survey images. Sometimes the [O III] is redshifted enough that this line overlaps with the r-band or i-band, which makes them green or red in survey images of the Hyper Suprime-Cam. At around 0.1<z<0.38 the 5006.843 Å [O III] line is redshifted to the r-band and at 0.38<z<0.68 it is redshifted to the i-band.\nAnother related type of cloud is a extended narrow-line region (ENLR). The EELRs usually have dynamically chaotic structures and high velocities and are probably the result of mergers. ENLRs on the other hand follow the disk structure of the galaxy and have a low velocity.\n\n\n== List of resolved EELRs ==\nThis is a list of EELRs with resolved [O III] images or other emission-lines\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "George Tahanto (died after 1704) (also known as Sagamore George or Tohanto) was a leader of the Nashaway tribe within the Pennacook confederation in what is now Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Tahanto was the nephew of Sachem Sholan.\n\n\n== Early life and background ==\nTahanto was baptized as a Christian, and eventually succeeded his uncle, Sholan, as leader of the Nashaway (Pennacook confederation).  The name \"Tahanto\" may have also been used by an earlier \"Tahanto, Sagmore of Pencooke\" who was living near what is now Concord, New Hampshire in 1636, when he \"granted to William Hilton Seniour & William Hilton Juniour six Miles of Land lying on ye River River Penneconquigg being a rivulette running into Penacooke River.\" In 1668 Tahanto opposed drunkenness amongst the Pennacook and helped execute a tribe member who committed a murder while intoxicated.\n\n\n== Conflict with settlers and leaving homeland ==\nOn January 27, 1699 George Tahanto and his cousin, Wattanummon, went to Boston and ratified a peace treaty with Richard Coote, 1st Earl of Bellomont. Although a large number of Native Americans met at Lake Winnipesaukee in the winter of 1699 to ally with the French and Iroquois, Tahanto and Wattanummon reassured the Massachusetts governor that they were not involved in the alliance and desired peace. In 1700 Tahanto and Wattanummon informed the Massachusetts governor that the Pennecook would not make war on the Mohegan tribe as was rumored. after \"George Tohanto and Wattanuman, the two principal Indians of Pennicook\" were ordered to go to Boston and report to the government about a possible war plot. In 1701 and 1702 Tahanto deeded large tracts of land to settlers, including the Nashaway homeland around the Waushacum ponds in Sterling, as well as land in what is now known as Boylston, Harvard, Leominster, and Lancaster. In 1702 Tohanto and Wattanummon met with Governor Dudley regarding preventing the Pennacooks from joining a French and Iroqouis alliance. By April 1703 Tahanto reportedly left for Canada, but in June participated with Wattanummon in Governor Joseph Dudley's peace conference at Casco Bay.  In 1704 Tahanto was living in Cowass in what is now Newbury, Vermont, when his kinsman Wattanummon provided Tahanto with a hostage from the Deerfield Raid, 10-year-old Stephen Williams, as detailed by Stephen and his father John in their published narratives.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nTahanto Regional High School in Boylston, Massachusetts, the Tahanto neighborhood of Harvard, Massachusetts, Tahanto Point in Boylston on the Wachusetts Reservoir, and a locomotive are named after Tahanto.

        "content": "Annelie Rabie is a South African politician who has served as the executive mayor of the Overstrand Local Municipality since November 2021. Previously, she was the mayor of the Central Karoo District Municipality between 2018 and 2020. Rabie is a member of the Democratic Alliance. \n\n\n== Career ==\nRabie was for many years the Cape Executive head of the Business Against Corruption non-profit organization until she was suspended in March 2011 after being accused of abusing her BAC credit card as well as increasing her salary without the organization's approval. She then submitted her resignation in April because she was nominated as the Democratic Alliance's mayoral candidate for the Prince Albert Local Municipality, but it was not accepted. Rabie was elected as a DA councilor in the Prince Albert municipality during the local elections in May and then as caucus leader of the DA on the council. After a long disciplinary process, she was fired by the BAC national management on 17 June 2011. According to a letter issued by the Commercial Crime Unit (Hawks) in February 2016, no charges were laid against Rabie, no investigation took place, and she was never charged and/or convicted of any offense by an official law enforcement agency. Rabie was re-elected as a DA councilor in the Prince Albert municipality in the 2016 election and was also appointed as a councilor of the Central Karoo district municipality. In March 2018, she was elected mayor of the district municipality after the DA formed a coalition with the smaller Karoo Community Party. Rabie was removed from office by a motion of no confidence in July 2020 after the mayor of Prince Albert, Goliat Lottering of the KGP, suspended the coalition agreements between his party and the DA. \nIn August 2021, the DA named Rabie as their mayoral candidate for the Overstrand Local Municipality for the elections that would take place on 1 November 2021. The DA retained their majority on the Overstrand city council in the election and Rabie was then elected mayor during the first session of the council after the election on 17 November 2021 .\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Oryan Velox (born 28 October 2004) is a Vincentian footballer who plays for the academy of VfR Aalen and the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines national team.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== Youth ===\nVelox's skill was apparent from a young age. He led his school team to the bronze medal in the 2015 Primary Schools Football Championship as the league's top scorer that season. At the club level, as a youth Velox came through the youth setup of System 3. He was the National Under-14 League's top scorer with the club in 2018 with ten goals. He scored two goals against Avenues United in the final to secure the championship. Also in 2018, he was one of two Vincentians chosen to travel to Trinidad and Tobago for a skills competition and opportunity to be observed by scouts from Manchester United. As part of the Barrouallie Secondary squad, Velox scored a hat-trick in the final match of the 2018 SVGFF Inter-Secondary Schools Football Tournament to secure the school's third consecutive championship. He was the top scorer of the same competition while playing for Central Leeward Secondary School the following year.\n\n\n=== Senior ===\nBy 2019, Velox had moved to Layou FC in the First Division before the team was promoted to the Premier Division for the 2020/2021 season. Following the 2019/2020 season, the 15-year-old was one of three finalists for the National Sports Council's Sportsperson of the Year award. In 2022, he went on trial in Germany through the Soccer Academy Arnstadt and eventually joined the academy of Rot-Weiß Erfurt. \nIn September 2023, it was announced that he had moved to Regionalliga Südwest club VfR Aalen on a one-year deal. Club management referred to the player as an \"unpolished diamond\" at the time of the signing. The following month, the player was still waiting to make his official debut for his new club as he had not yet received his work clearances.\n\n\n== International career ==\nVelox represented Saint Vincent and the Grenadines at various youth levels. He was the top scorer of the 2019 CONCACAF Boys' Under-15 Championship with six goals in four matches. To qualify for the tournament, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines topped Group A in the 2014 Caribbean Football Union U14 Challenge Shield played on Saint Kitts and Nevis. Velox scored four goals in as many matches in the tournament. In 2021, he was part of the squad that competed in 2022 CONCACAF U-20 Championship qualifying. Velox served as the team's captain and scored in a 2–0 victory over Barbados in the last match of the group stage.\nIn March 2021, Velox received his first call-up to the senior national team for a pair of 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification matches. He was called up again in preparation for the June qualifiers. He went on to make his senior international debut on 4 June 2021 in a  match against Guatemala at age sixteen. He scored his first senior international goal on 21 November 2023 in a 3–0 victory over Belize in 2023–24 CONCACAF Nations League B. With the win, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines secured second place in Group B.\n\n\n=== International goals ===\nScores and results list Saint Vincent and the Grenadines' goal tally first.\n\n\n=== International career statistics ===\nAs of match played 21 November 2023.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOryan Velox at National-Football-Teams.com\nOryan Velox at Soccerway\nOryan Velox at Global Sports Archive\nOryan Velox at kicker (in German)",

Before becoming mayor, he served as a training manager and is the director of several companies; he's the commercial director of Alpha-Press, commercial director of Graphi Service, and general director of Graphi Imprim. Béouindé also served as the vice-president for the Association for Integrity and Stable Development of Burkina Faso (A2DI), a coordinator at a managerial training group, and as the former president of ASFA Yennenga.\nPolitically, Béouindé was originally a part of Blaise Compaoré's political party Congress for Democracy and Progress (CDP), but left with Roch Marc Christian Kaboré and other friends of his after the 2014 Burkina Faso uprising. He co-founded the People's Movement for Progress (MPP) with Kabore later that year, and served as a campaign manager for Kabore's election campaign in 2015.\nBéouindé was elected as the mayor of Ouagadougou on June 18, 2016. As mayor, his development plan for the city was dubbed Ouaga21, named for his deadline and final year in power in 2021. Ouaga21 focused mainly on security in the city, environmental issues, and mobility. He also made plans to increase water availability and other key resources to the city, earning the money by increasing tax availability and transparency. A key tenet of Béouindé's policies in the city were expanding social welfare programs and promoting diversity, although this sometimes caused financial issues.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nResume and biography of Armand Béouindé\n\n\n== References ==\n\n Media related to Armand Béouindé at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Allah Kuli Bahadur Khan (Uzbek: Olloqulixon; Russian: Аллакули-хан) (1794–1842), was the 5th Khan of the Uzbek Kungrat dynasty in the Khanate of Khiva. He reigned between 1825 and 1842.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAllah Kuli (or Quli) ascended the throne in 1825, upon the death of his father Mohammed Rahim Khan.\nHe continued his father's policy of centralization. He put down the rebellion of the Turkmen Saryk tribe in 1828. He also continued the policy of economic recovery of the previous reign and had new canals dug and the irrigation system improved. In 1830–1831, the canal from Khiva to Konye-Urgench was dug.\nEnemy of the neighboring Shaybanids dynasty of the rich Emirate of Bukhara, he carried out several raids against his neighbor. Likewise, he undertook five expeditions against Khorasan.\nAllah Kuli strengthened diplomatic ties with the Russian Empire, the Ottoman Empire and Afghanistan, established new ties with Great Britain and tried to get closer ties with Persia. Two British envoys, James Abbott and Richmond Shakespear, were dispatched to the court of Khiva in 1840, as part of the Great Game between British and Russians. After the failed Russian Khivan campaign of 1839 and a brief cooling off in relationship, Khiva sent mufti Ataniaz Khodja Raïs as ambassador to Saint Petersburg to the court of Nicholas I, later in 1840.\nThen in 1841, a Russian diplomatic mission, led by Captain Nikiphorov, was sent to the Tash Hauli Palace at the court of the Khan of Khiva. The following year, Nicholas I received the Khivaite ambassadors Vaïsbaï Niyazov and Imbaï Babaev in Saint Petersburg.\n\n\n== Cultural influence ==\nIt was during the reign of Allah Kuli that the vast Tash Hauli Palace in the Itchan Kala was built, which was to serve as the official residence of the Khan in Khiva. A vast Madrasa bearing his name was also built (1834–1835), as well as a new Caravanserai (1832–1833), a tim (covered market under a dome), the Saïtbaï mosque, the Ak Mosque, etc.\nIn 1842, the Khan built six kilometers of walls around Dishan Kala, the outlying district of Khiva. They were built in just a month.\nIt was also under his reign that the poet-historian Mounis Khorezmi, the poets Rodjikh, Dilavar, Said Mirza Djounaïd, and Mirza Massikho exercised their talents. Mounis Khorezmi and the historian Ogahi wrote a history of Khorezm.\nWhen Allah Kuli died, his son Muhammad Rahim Kuli succeeded him. He reigned from 1842 to 1845. Another son of Allah Kuli, Mohammed Amin Khan, then took over.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nGulomov Kh.

        "content": "The Siege of Janjira was a military campaign undertaken by the Maratha Empire, commanded by Sambhaji, the second Maratha ruler, against the Siddis of Janjira in January 1682. The Maratha forces, led by Sambhaji, withdrew from Janjira to the Konkan region in response to Mughal attacks, leaving a contingent behind under the command of Dadaji Raghunath Deshpande. Despite their efforts, the Marathas were unable to capture the fort, and the Siddis pursued the retreating forces, plundering Maratha territories.\nThe Siddis of Janjira, who allied with the Mughal Empire following the fall of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate, posed a significant threat to the Marathas of Konkan. During Shivaji's reign, several unsuccessful attempts were made to capture Janjira, the Siddi's capital. After Shivaji's death, his son Sambhaji, along with Prince Akbar, the rebellious son of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, and the Rajputs of Marwar, sought to besiege the Janjira fort. Initially, Sambhaji dispatched his commander Dadaji Raghunath Deshpande, later joining the siege himself. However, continuous Mughal attacks on the Konkan region forced Sambhaji to withdraw at an interval. Following Sambhaji's departure, the remaining Maratha forces were compelled to retreat from Janjira, resulting in heavy casualties among the Marathas.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe Siddis, African Muslims originally from Abyssinia, commonly known as Abyssinian Muslims, arrived in India through slave trades, as traders, or by settling in pursuit of their livelihood. They established settlements along the Malabar coast of India and gradually evolved into a naval power, with their main base located at Janjira, described as an \"impregnable sea-girt fortress.\" The island of Janjira was seized by the Sultan of Ahmadnagar in 1498. The Siddis pledged their loyalty to him, and their local leader, known as Siddi, by his traditional title, was appointed as the Governor of Janjira on behalf of the Ahmadnagar state. This appointment granted legal validation to their inherited status as the local chiefs of Janjira. In 1636, during Siddi Ambar's governorship of Janjira, the Mughals ultimately conquered Ahmednagar, and the Ahmednagar Konkan region was relinquished to the Bijapur Subah of the Mughal empire.\nWith the ascent of Shivaji and the subsequent decline of Bijapur as an independent state, coupled with the loss of one of their more distant forts to the Marathas, the Siddis of Janjira shifted their allegiance to the Mughal Empire. Recognizing the value of their fleet and maritime expertise, Aurangzeb granted an annual payment of 400,000 rupees for the upkeep of their fleet and appointed Kassem Siddi, formerly the Bijapur governor of Janjira, as his Admiral. According to Orme, this change in loyalty occurred in 1661, with Low stating that \"the condition of his tenure was the maintenance of a marine for the protection of the Mughal subjects trading to the Gulf of Persia and Arabia, from the Malabar pirates and the Portuguese.\" During Shivaji's leadership, the Siddis of Janjira were a persistent threat to the Marathas. The Siddis of Janjira are depicted in the Ajayapatra (royal edict) of Amatya, a statesman from the era of Shivaji, as follows:\n\n\"Further with a view to bring under his control this kingdom by his valour, he thought of subduing first the adjoining enemy who was like a disease in the stomach. The Shyamalas (Siddis) were truly the causes of harm to the state.... On account of the Shyamalas the success of the chief enemy was at first great, nay during the adverse times the Shyamalas conquered several territories and forts. At first the late revered king... checked the Shyamalas. On that occasion they were supported by the Tamras (Mughals) and therefore the Shyamalas remained as a power.\"\nThroughout his reign, Shivaji orchestrated numerous unsuccessful endeavors to breach the formidable forty-three-foot-high walls of Janjira. In 1676, Shivaji constructed Padmadurg sea fort northeast of Janjira in an attempt to rival the Siddi stronghold, yet this initiative ultimately ended in failure. Shivaji's offensive in 1659 against Janjira failed, leading to escalating conflicts with the Siddis. He amassed a fleet of 40 to 50 warships but faced frequent naval battles, often losing to the Abyssinians. In 1672, Siddi Yakut ravaged Bombay, forcing the British into negotiations. Despite treaties, Siddis repeatedly attacked Bombay, causing scarcity and loss for the English and Marathas. They burnt down the villages and took thousands as captives of the war. Despite his successes elsewhere, Shivaji struggled against the Siddis, a challenge that continued into Sambhaji's reign after Shivaji's death.\n\n\n=== Pre conflicts ===\n\nDuring Sambhaji's reign, the Konkan emerged as the primary center of Maratha activity. Sambhaji confronted the Mughal armies led by Aurangzeb in person. The entire Maratha region was embroiled in conflict. The Siddis, who had pledged allegiance to Aurangzeb, battled the Marathas, spreading havoc and seizing many strongholds in the Konkan. Siddi Qasim annually sent his smaller vessels from Underi or Henry to safe havens in Bombay harbor and sailed with larger vessels to patrol near Danda Rajpuri.\nThe Siddis violated their treaty with the British, attacking the English stronghold of Bombay. In the ensuing skirmish, casualties occurred on both sides. The following day, Siddi Qasim and his troops approached the fort, prompting gunfire from English ships. Eventually, they were allowed to anchor under the condition not to attack the Maratha coast.\nHowever, Sambhaji was displeased with the English's protection and threatened to invade Bombay. Subsequently, Sambhaji attempted to burn the Siddi ships and landed 200 men in Underi, resulting in disaster of Marathas as most were killed or captured. The Siddis brought the heads of 80 Marathas to Bombay, from the heads of the troops that were killed in the conflict. Despite plans to display 80 heads on poles, the British council intervened to prevent such cruelty.\n\n\n== The siege ==\n\nIn early January 1682, Dadaji Raghunath Deshpande, a Maratha general, was dispatched to Janjira, the capital of the Siddis. Sambhaji pledged to appoint him as one of the eight Pradhans of the Maratha empire if he successfully besieged and captured the Janjira fort. By the final days of December 1681, Durga Das Rathore, the Rajput ruler of Marwar, and Prince Akbar, the son of Aurangzeb who rebelled against the Mughals, formed an alliance with Sambhaji against the Siddis. They converged with the forces of Raghunath Deshpande at Rajpuri, bringing a contingent of 20,000 men.\nDuring the siege of Janjira, Sambhaji devised a cunning scheme with the assistance of Kondaji Farzand. They orchestrated a plot for Janjira's defection. Kondaji pretended to have a falling out and joined the Siddis, intending to detonate the Siddi magazine on the day specified by Sambhaji for the attack. Additionally, Kondaji brought women to corrupt the garrison. However, one of them had been the mistress of a Siddi officer, who learned of the plot. As a result, Kondaji and his associates were executed. Sambhaji then endeavored to fill the channel, which was eight hundred yards wide and thirty feet deep, with stones and rock fragments, aiming to create a causeway for the assaulting parties. However, Sambhaji's presence was short-lived as he was compelled to abandon the siege. He left ten thousand men under Raghunath Deshpande's command at Janjira due to ongoing Mughal attacks in the Konkan region, including the capture of the Kalyan fort.\nSheltered by a rock in the middle of the island, the garrison, led by Siddi Khairyat, persisted in their defense while Siddi Qasim cleared the bay of Sambhaji's fleet. After Sambhaji's departure, Deshpande ceased fighting and retreated from Janjira. Siddi Qasim pursued the Marathas to Bombay, where the Maratha general Dadaji Prabhu Deshpande attempted to defend by assembling boats for a counterattack, but they were ultimately repelled, resulting in a loss of two hundred men.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe failed attempt, however, did not deter Sambhaji from continuing his campaigns against the Siddis. He dispatched one of his Subahdari to Anjavida, one of the domains of the Siddis, with the objective of capturing the fort and establishing a naval base. Upon learning of this, the Portuguese landed at Anjavida, expelled the Marathas, and established their own naval base there. This resulted in hostilities between Sambhaji and the Portuguese. In July of the same year, when Sambhaji attacked Chaul, which was under Portuguese control, Siddi Yakut Khan and Siddi Khairyat Khan rushed to the aid of the Portuguese.\nFor some time after Sambhaji departed, Siddi Qasim, along with his entire fleet, maintained a vigilant watch over Janjira. In April, he sailed to Bombay, where the English, fearing the Mughal Emperor's disapproval, permitted him to anchor. Following the arrival of the Siddis, they pillaged the Maratha coast, venturing as far inland as Mahad in Kolaba, and abducted the wife and family of Dadaji, Sambhaji's general.\nIn October, Sambhaji devised another assault on the Siddis, under the leadership of Siddi Misri, who had defected from the Siddis after losing command of the Mughal army. Sambhaji's forces comprised 30 vessels, while the Siddis had 15 vessels. Despite being outnumbered, the Siddis once again emerged victorious, inflicting wounds upon their leader Misri himself.\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nMehta, Jaswant Lal (2005-01-01).

        "content": "Limbongan–Klebang Highway is a major road in Malacca, Malaysia.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe highway is part of the Malacca Coastal Highway as the second phase.\nOn 23 July 2022, the parliament member of Kota Melaka, Khoo Poay Tiong, and state assembly member of Kota Laksamana, Low Chee Leong, demanded explanation from the Malacca state government over the no progress of last kilometer of the road for seven years. In 2015, the Chief Minister of Malacca at the time gave the developer the land title before the developer build the road.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nOn 5 January 2012, the groundbreaking of the project was officiated by Chief Minister of Malacca, Mohd Ali Rustam. He said that the project costs 50 million ringgit and will be borne by private sector.\nOn 16 April 2015, the construction of the bridge which crosses the Klebang River was started. The bridge cost around 20 million ringgit.\nOn 17 July 2015, the road was opened access for vehicles, but with a few warning signs that mentioned driver's own risks for accidents on this road. On 20 July 2015, the state assembly member of Bachang pointed out that since the road had not been commissioned and had not been transferred to the local government, the insurance companies had the right not to compensate drivers for accidents on the road. On his visit, at the entrance from 1Malaysia Square roundabout, there was a warning sign which mentioned it is a private road and the developer is not responsible for accidents. He pointed out he road was not listed in the Malaysian Public Works Department's roads blueprint.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Richmond Standard is a news site for Richmond, California that functions as the city's only local news outlet. Opened in 2014, It is funded by the Chevron Corporation, which owns the Chevron Richmond Refinery. The site has been praised for its coverage of local issues but criticized for its lack of coverage of stories that are negative toward Chevron.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Chevron Corporation has framed its funding of The Richmond Standard as community investment because The Independent, a Richmond-focused paper founded in 1910, had been folded into The Berkeley Gazette in 1978, only for the combined newspaper to shut down in 1984, leaving the area without local reporting.\nIn 2014, Jay Barmann of SFist praised the site's coverage of Richmond mayor Gayle McLaughlin failing to report that her September 2013 trip to Ecuador had been funded by Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa.\nIn September 2022, the United States House Committee on Natural Resources' report The Role of Public Relations Firms in Preventing Action on Climate Change found that The Richmond Standard had been created to quell public backlash in the wake of the Chevron Richmond Refinery's 2012 fire that resulted in approximately 15,000 residents seeking treatment at local hospitals and 19 occupational injuries.\nIn 2024, David Folkenflik of NPR and Miranda Green of Floodlight criticized the site for failing to report on a February 2021 pipeline rupture and November 2023 refinery flare that had polluted the air and water of the San Francisco Bay Area. They argued that Chevron's funding had biased its editorial stance against informing local residents of the health risks posed by this pollution. Edward Wasserman, the former dean of the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism, has likened the site's corporate funding to media ownership structures during the Gilded Age, claiming that it is unethical for Chevron to control public opinion in a town where it is the largest employer.\n\n\n== Operations ==\nThe site is operated by the public relations firm Singer Associates. Its three-person news team consists of editor Mike Aldax, a former San Francisco Examiner journalist; community and lifestyle reporter Zach Chouteau; and business reporter Mike Kinney.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Hildenbrandia rivularis is a species of freshwater red algae. It forms red, crusty thalli on stones submerged in water, typically in streams and rivers, less commonly in lakes and brackish parts of seas. It occurs in scattered locations on almost all continents. The species was formerly considered an indicator of clean or slightly polluted waters. The scientific genus name is sometimes spelled in various orthographic variants, especially as Hildenbrandtia. The life cycle of this species was described by the Polish hydrobiologist Karol Starmach.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\n=== Habit ===\nThe thallus is in the form of a flat crust closely adhering to the rocky substrate, giving it the appearance of a coating. It grows radially, assuming a rounded, disc-like shape. It is composed of cells arranged in tightly fused vertical rows, with weakly branching. The lower layer of the thallus adheres to the substrate, without forming rhizoids. The upper layer of the thallus is smooth. The filaments of the vegetative thallus are strongly fused and difficult to separate. Forms similar to transections may develop at the edges of the thallus. The color is blood-red (from pink to burgundy), with a brownish hue in winter. Growth in thickness is limited, making it impossible to distinguish annual growth layers.\nCompared to other freshwater red algae, it exhibits relatively low phenological variability, while its eco-physiological parameters and reproductive intensity vary depending on seasonal conditions.\n\n\n=== Anatomy ===\nAnatomical features are quite variable. Initially, it was thought to be geographic variability, but in reality, the same variability occurs within local populations. Cells are approximately cylindrical to spherical. Individual cells contain single chloroplasts. Cells in different parts of the thallus have uneven sizes, varying even twofold, especially in the case of branching. The average size of cells is 8.4 × 8.6 μm, the average length of filaments is 38.4 μm, and the average thickness of the basal layer is 5.5 μm in the typical form, while in the variety distinguished by slightly darker coloration – Hildenbrandia rivularis var. drescheri Lingelsh. 1922 – these dimensions are respectively: 6.0 × 6.4 μm, 52.8 μm, 9.2 μm. Despite these differences, molecular studies do not indicate distinctiveness of this variety, and specimens classified as the species H. rivularis (at least those from Europe and the Canary Islands) show relatively low genetic variability compared to other traditionally recognized species of this genus. Despite the vivid red color of the entire thallus, individual cells may appear light green.\n\n\n=== Similar species ===\nThe most similar species is another freshwater representative of the genus – Hildenbrandia angolensis. The range of anatomical dimensions of these two species overlaps, but on average, the cells of H. angolensis are smaller. A similar range of cell sizes is also found in the freshwater Hildenbrandia cuprea. Its colonies form a crustose mat and are brick-red, while colonies of H. rivularis form a crustose, vivid red biofilm. Sometimes, the thalli of both species can be very similar to each other.\nIt may be confused with other algae forming crustose thalli on rocks, such as the brown algae Heribaudiella fluviatilis. In saline waters, including the entire Baltic Sea, its variants are usually other species of Hildenbrandia (especially Hildenbrandia rubra), although it may co-occur with them in the brackish Bothnian Bay.\n\n\n== Reproduction ==\nThe explanation of the life cycle of Hildenbrandia rivularis is considered one of Karol Starmach's most important discoveries.\nFreshwater species are exceptional within the genus Hildenbrandia because they do not produce tetraspores and reproduce exclusively asexually. This applies not only to Hildenbrandia rivularis but also to Hildenbrandia angolensis. Karol Starmach hypothesized that the reproductive organs homologous to the tetrasporangia of other Hildenbrandia species are its gemmae, but this hypothesis has not been confirmed. Likewise, the presence of true tetrasporangia and the production of tetraspores reported in the 1950s have not been confirmed.\nAccording to observations by Starmach from the late 1920s, bright spots appear on the upper side of the thallus of Hildenbrandia rivularis, which then grow into nodules and warts covered with a layer of mucus. For several decades, phycologists did not know their function. Theories were proposed that they could be antheridia or oogonia with trichogynes. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Starmach conducted observations and experiments involving these structures, proving that they are gmmae. The gemmae consist of short (usually eight-celled) filaments arranged side by side, noticeably thicker than the filaments of the parent thallus (5–12 μm) and are relatively easy to separate. During their growth, their cells fill with starch at the expense of the space occupied by chloroplasts and swell. Their exterior becomes mucilaginous. Due to the compact arrangement of the filaments of the parent thallus, swelling causes the filaments to grow and protrude outward from the thallus. Mature gemmae are nodules with a diameter of up to 1 mm. These structures occur on the thallus year-round but develop most intensively in warm months, often when water levels are low, allowing rocks with thalli to protrude above the water. The gemmae detach, leaving small depressions in the thallus, and are carried away by the current. Upon contact with a substrate, they settle on it, adhere with mucus, and after two days, develop rhizoids emerging from several basal cells. These rhizoids do not contain chloroplasts. Under favorable conditions, some rhizoids branch, and new chloroplast-containing cells develop at their tips, giving rise to new thalli. In unfavorable conditions, such as winter, this process takes several weeks. After a few more days, the cells of the gemmae die, as do the older parts of the rhizoids, and the newly formed thalli grow radially on the substrate. The development of new crustose thalli requires the apex cell of the rhizoid to come into contact with a hard substrate, while on a soft substrate, filaments that do not form typical thalli develop. In such cases, a form resembling Chantransia may rarely appear, which over time may transform into a typical thallus.\nGemmae and thallus fragments usually flow downstream, and upstream transport likely occurs through animals such as leeches or Chironomidae's larvae.\nReproduction through thallus fragmentation, i.e., the regeneration of a new thallus from a piece of old thallus not being a gemma, also occurs but is less common in natural conditions. In such cases, rhizoids or thread-like forms resembling Chantransia may not form.\nAnother relatively rare form of vegetative reproduction is the formation of filaments resembling stolons, on which new thalli develop at the ends. These stolons have been described as Chantransia hildenbrandtiae.\n\n\n== Ecology and occurrence ==\n\n\n=== Distribution ===\nThe species is freshwater, although it also occurs in the most brackish waters of the Baltic Sea – the Bothnian Bay and its surroundings (Archipelago Sea). Its presence has been recorded in almost the whole of Europe, including the Caucasus, the basin of the Caribbean Sea, eastern Asia, the Congo Basin, eastern Australia, and New Zealand. Records in North America may actually refer to Hildenbrandia angolensis.\nIn some 20th-century sources, it was considered a common species in Poland, especially in the north and in the Carpathian Mountains. According to other studies, it occurs in scattered locations in Poland – mainly in Pomerania, less frequently in the Beskids, and until the 21st century, it was almost unheard of in central Poland. Since then, additional occurrences have been noted, and it can now be found in almost every part of Poland. In the 21st century, apart from the northern, western, and mountainous parts of Poland, it has been recorded in isolated locations. During this period, there has been a multiple increase in the number of known habitats, accompanied by the disappearance of historical mountain habitats.\n\n\n=== Autecology ===\nLithophyte, a component of the phytobenthos, has a relatively broad ecological tolerance, although it prefers swiftly flowing rivers with relatively clean water. It favors shaded areas but can also occur in sun-exposed locations. The crusty shape of its thallus allows it to fit into the boundary layer, where the current has less effect. Hildenbrandia more often covers the parts of rocks facing the current. It grows in waters with various flow velocities, averaging 32 cm/s, which qualifies it as a rheophile. However, it is also found in slower-flowing and stagnant waters. The presence of hard, mineral substrate is crucial for the settling and development of Hildenbrandia. Therefore, it often occurs on knickpoints, boulders, gravel, as well as on artificial substrates like the infrastructure of watermills. It can also settle on seashells or glass. Swift flow promotes water self-purification, especially from easily oxidizable organic pollutants, thus Hildenbrandia rivularis is considered an saprobic system for clean waters: xenosaprobic and oligosaprobic. It is somewhat less sensitive to excess minerals, tolerating elevated nitrogen content but not high phosphorus content. It occurs over a wide range of specific electrolytic conductivity (a measure of dissolved mineral substances). It is found in waters with a slightly acidic to slightly alkaline pH, although it is more common in alkaline waters, hence it is described as an alkaliphile. This preference is also associated with hard water. Despite this, it tends to cover acidic rocks with low calcium content, although it is also found in limestone quarries. In alpine streams, it dominates warm waters in the summer – both nutrient-poor and calcium-rich. It is a eurythermic species but prefers warm waters.\nIt can also occur in stagnant waters. In such an environment, it prefers shaded areas with fairly strong wave action. In Lake Constance, it was recorded at depths of 8–45 m, and in Lake Garda, even up to 90 m.\n\n\n=== Bioindicators ===\nFreshwater red algae, including Hildenbrandia rivularis, are considered bioindicators of water cleanliness. However, among them, it is recognized as a species relatively tolerant to pollution. In German literature, it falls into categories of indicators for fertile waters: meso-eutrophic or eu-politrophic and β-mesosaprobic, indicating moderately polluted waters. As a trophic indicator, it has relatively low significance, but as a saprobic system, it holds relatively high importance. In those types of watercourses where it is significant as an indicator, it is classified as a non-diatom phytobenthos species in category B, meaning it is less sensitive than taxa requiring the best environmental conditions. In Poland, it is taken into account when determining the River Macrophyte Index, with values of W=6 (indicating a preference for mesotrophic waters) and L=2 (indicating an average tolerance range). Due to its broader ecological tolerance than previously believed, its bioindicative value is questioned.\n\n\n=== Interspecies interactions and phytosociology ===\nOccupying habitats where it is difficult for other organisms to settle allows Hildenbrandia rivularis to avoid competition, although its ecological niche may overlap with that occupied by Heribaudiella fluviatilis. It happens that specimens of this species overgrow Hildenbrandia individuals. Mosses such as Leptodictyum riparium, Fontinalis antipyretica, Hygroamblystegium tenax, or Rhynchostegium confertum, as well as lichens like Verrucaria elaeomelaena or Verrucaria rheitrophila, may also occur in similar habitats. It relatively often occurs near habitats of yellow water-lily, arrowhead, and crisp-leaved pondweed.\nThe surface of Hildenbrandia thallus is colonized by various epiphytic organisms, such as the diatom Cocconeis lineata. Thalli may be grazed upon by insect larvae (e.g., chironomids) or snails, but this phenomenon usually does not cause significant damage.\nThe plant community formed by Hildenbrandia rivularis is referred to as the Hildenbrandietum rivularis phytoassociation (Luther 1954). It was also described as the non-rank association Hildenbrandia-Lithoderma (Fritsch 1929), redefined as the Hildenbrandio rivularis-Heribaudielletum fluviatilis (Fritsch 1929 corr. Täuscher). It belongs to the class of crustose communities or mats of epilithic algae Lemaneetea. In another system, the Rheithrophilo-Hildenbrandietum phytoassociation is distinguished, composed of Hildenbrandia rivularis, Verrucaria rheitrophila, and cyanobacteria such as Chamaesiphon polonicus and Chamaesiphon fuscus.\nExceptionally, Hildenbrandia rivularis can occupy habitats typical for marine species, such as Hildenbrandia rubra. This occurs in the most freshwater areas of the Baltic Sea (Bothnian Bay).\n\n\n== Threats and preservation ==\nIn Poland, Hildenbrandia rivularis has been under species protection since 2004 (as one of the few algae species outside the charales group). It is listed on the red list of algae in Poland with a status of V – vulnerable species. It is also included in the red book of plants of Belarus. In the red list of Finland in 2019, it was classified as NT – near-threatened species.\nBeing a shade-tolerant species, its habitats are threatened by the cutting of riparian forests.\nThe habitat of Hildenbrandia rivularis on a hundred-meter stretch of stream in the Ślęża Landscape Park has been established as a natural monument called Red Algae (Polish: Krasnorost).\n\n\n== Systematics and origins ==\nIt is assumed that its ancestors were marine algae. According to initial hypotheses, the transition to freshwater occurred in the Tertiary period or earlier. Another hypothesis suggested that various subpopulations originated from multiple independent transitions of the marine form to inland water. In the case of populations in the Baltic Sea basin, this would only be possible after the retreat of the glacier, i.e., during the Holocene. The parent species could be Hildenbrandia rubra, which inhabits transitional waters in the Baltic Sea, among other places. With multiple invasions, genetic differentiation of European subpopulations could be expected, stemming from different parent populations. However, in reality, populations of Hildenbrandia rivularis are very homogeneous, suggesting that there was a single invasion from saltwater. Furthermore, genetic distinctiveness from marine species indicates that it has a history predating the end of the Weichselian glaciation.\nHildenbrandia rivularis shows low genetic variability, which may result from the fact that it reproduces only asexually. For several decades, a variety called Hildenbrandia rivularis var. drescheri (Lingelsheim 1922) was distinguished, with Ligota Wielka near Otmuchów as its type locality. In phycological tradition, such distinguished varieties are treated almost on par with separate species. This variety has slightly larger cells and a darker shade. Molecular studies do not indicate the distinctiveness of this taxon, and since 2003, it has not been distinguished. Based on morphological and ecological differences, a subspecies occurring in the Mecsek mountains, Hildenbrandia rivularis subsp. chalikophila (Palik 1961), was distinguished, initially described as a separate species, Hildenbrandia chalikophila (Palik 1957).\nBoth morphologically and genetically, the most similar are two other species of freshwater Hildenbrandia: Hildenbrandia angolensis and Hildenbrandia cuprea. The latter species was recognized for many years as a cyanobacterium under the name Pleurocapsa cuprea. Another freshwater species, Hildenbrandia ramanaginae, occurs in India but is poorly described and is not included in molecular analyses allowing for the determination of relatedness.\nIn addition to the genus Hildenbrandia in the family Hildenbrandiaceae, the genus Apophlaea is distinguished. However, molecular data indicate that its clade is nested within the Hildenbrandia clade, so it could be eliminated. In such a case, the family Hildenbrandiaceae would be monotypic. Moreover, subsequent taxa at higher ranks up to the level of subclass Hildenbrandiophyceae are also monotypic. Therefore, in cladistic classification systems, the family Hildenbrandiaceae is a distinct clade from other clades at the rank of subclass, emerging with them from the node Florideophycidae.\n\n\n=== Name ===\nThe generic name in the form of Hildbrandtia was coined in 1834 by Giandomenico Nardo, commemorating the Viennese doctor of medicine and botany Hildbrandt (cui nomen venit a clarissimo doctore Hildbrandt Vindobonensi, clinico illustri, ac Botanico peritissimo). Most likely, it refers to Franz Xaver Edler von Hildenbrand (1789–1849). Hence, in the literature, from the very beginning, various versions of the name were used, such as Hildebrandtia, Hildenbrandia, Hildenbrandtia, and Hildenbrantia. The term Hildenbrandia was proposed in 1840 by Giovanni Zanardini and over time, especially since the 1950s, it became dominant (after identifying the person commemorated by this name).\nThe species was first scientifically described by Frederik Michael Liebmann in a work from 1838 based on holotypic specimens collected by Statsraada Hornemann in 1826 in a stream at Kongens Møller in Zealand (type locality). He then assigned it the name Erythroclathrus rivularis, noting that it refers to algae also described as Palmella rubra or Verrucaria rubra. The binomial nomenclature rivularis has a Latin origin and is often given to species associated with streams. Subsequently, the same species was described by Giovanni Zanardini as Hildenbrandia paroliniana and by Louis Alphonse de Brébisson as Hildenbrandia fluviatilis (without the required taxonomic diagnosis). In 1849, Friedrich Traugott Kützing recognized that these were the same taxa, simultaneously considering them a riverine variety of Hildebrandtia rosea, i.e., Hildenbrandtia rosea var. fluviatilis. In 1851, Jakob Georg Agardh transferred the species under the current name, then written as Hildenbrandtia rivularis.\n\n\n== Cultural significance ==\nBy covering flintstones with a durable pink color, Hildenbrandia may have influenced the perception of places where this phenomenon occurs (e.g., Stonehenge) as magical.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Gabriel Perrotta Bacellar (born December 26, 1998) is a Paraguayan professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for USL Championship club, Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC. Born in Asunción, he represented Paraguay at youth level.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Youth and college ===\nPrior to playing for college teams in the United States, Perrotta played for Club Nacional's youth teams. However, he never played for the first team, and joined professional team Club Guaraní in 2018.\nPerrotta joined Wilmington in 2019, and was in the league's Rookie Team of the Season. Perrotta kept 6 shutouts in the 2020–21 season, making 4 saves in the 2–0 win over Elon. In 2021, Perrotta had a notable performance in the game against Campbell in the 3–2 loss, making a career high of 7 saves. In 2022, Perrotta held a momentous 3-game shutout streak from September 13–20.\nAfter the 2022 season with Wilmington, Perrotta signed with Marshall Thundering Herd for the 2023 season. Perrotta was named Goalkeeper of the Year with Marshall after the 2023 season. In the games Perrotta played, he kept 10.5 clean sheets (Perrotta missed 6 minutes of a game that Marshall kept a clean sheet in) and of the games he played in, 17 of those were wins. Following the 2023 season with Thundering Herd, Perrotta signed with professional team Pittsburgh Riverhounds.\n\n\n=== Professional ===\nAt age 19, Perrotta left youth football and joined Paraguayan club Guarani. He was a substitute in Guarani's 2–1 win over Club Atlético 3 de Febrero. Perrotta departed Guarani in 2019 and returned to college football, this time in the United States with UNC Wilmington Seahawks.\nPerrotta returned to professional football when on March 7, 2024, he signed with Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC in the USL Championship as a former trialist. He was given the number 12. Perrotta was the second player from UNC Wilmington to sign with Pittsburgh that year, as Jacob Randolph had as well. Former Riverhounds Jonathan Gomes had also signed from Wilmington the previous year.\n\n\n== International career ==\nPerrotta represented the Paraguay national under-20 football team, playing 1 game.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Lieutenant general Ahmad Pasha al-Munkali (Egyptian Arabic: أحمد باشا المنكلي) was one of the most famous Egyptian military leaders in the nineteenth century. He participated in the Syrian war and the Crimean war.\n\n\n== Military career ==\nHe was seriously wounded in the 1838 Druze revolt. Al-Munkali participated in the Syrian war with Ibrahim Pasha, son of Mahammad Ali Pasha, he led the infantry in the Battle of Nezib. When the Egyptian armies evacuated the Levant, the army was divided into three divisions, one of which was led by Ibrahim Pasha, the second by Soliman Pasha al-Faransawi, and the third by Ahmad Pasha al-Munkali. Each of these three divisions took a different path.\nAfter his return from Syria, Mahammad Ali appointed him to administrative positions. Then he sent him to Sudan to organize it. But Ibrahim Pasha assigned him in 1848 to reorganize the army and appointed him as Nazir al-Jihadia (Minister of Defense). After Ibrahim Pasha died, Abbas I removed him.\nIn the Crimean War, Ahmad Pasha al-Munkali replaced Lieutenant General Selim Fathi Pasha in command of the Egyptian armies in Crimea, after the latter was killed in the Battle of Eupatoria. Al-Munkali remained in this position until illness forced him to ask the wāli of Egypt, Sa'id Pasha, for permission to return to Egypt. The wāli responded to his request on Muharram 15, 1272 AH, corresponding to September 27, 1855, and appointed Major General Isma'il Pasha Abu Jabal in his place.\n\n\n== Political positions ==\nAl-Munkali took on the job of Nazir al-Jihadia (Minister of Defense) several times.\n\n\n== Family ==\nHis son Ali Jalal Pasha married Princess Zubaida, daughter of Mahammad Ali Tawfik, and with her he had two sons, Mahammad Ali Jalal and Muhyiddin Jalal Bey.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSelim Fathi Pasha\nMahammad Rustum Bey\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Judith von Kärnten (died 991), also Judith of Bavaria, was a Carinthian noble woman, likely from the Luitpolding dynasty, and duchess of Carinthia.\n\n\n== Life ==\n\nLittle definite information is known about her life. Scholars typically connect her to the Luitpolding dynasty due to her name which was common in this family and also due to the fact that her husband Otto was given the duchy of Carinthia, which would have been likely if she was from there. It is typically assumed that her grandfather was Arnulf, Duke of Bavaria and he father Arnulf's son Henry.\nShe married Count Otto of Wormsgau who was made duke of Carinthia in 978. It is possible that Judith and Otto lived in Carinthia already before that year, and the village Stainbach claims to be the birthplace of her son Bruno (born ca. 972) who would later become Pope Gregory V. Through her son Henry of Speyer she became the grandmother of the Holy Roman emperor Conrad II of the Salian dynasty. She died in 991. \nAccording to a charter of Conrad II from 1034, she was buried in one of the six tombs in front of the altar in Worms Cathedral. When during construction in 1906 works several tombs were discovered, the project manager Philipp Brand matched these to those members of the Salian dynasty, among them Judith and her two sons Henry and Conrad. \n\n\n== Issue ==\nTogether with her husband Otto she had the following known four children:\n\nHenry of Speyer (died before 1000), Count in the Wormsgau\nPope Gregory V (died 999)\nConrad I, Duke of Carinthia (died 1011)\nWilliam I, Bishop of Strasbourg (died 1047)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nKönig, Alexandra (2008). \"Die textilen Grabfunden aus dem Dom zu Worms\".

        "content": "Robert Janes (1806–1866) was organist of Ely Cathedral from 1830 until his death aged 59 in 1866.\nHe attended Dulwich College where he was a chorister, then at the age of 14 he was articled to the renowned choir trainer and organist of Norwich Cathedral Zechariah Buck, becoming his first pupil.\nShortly after his appointment to Ely, he oversaw the replacement of the old greatly deficient organ with a new one by Elliot & Hill.\nThe choral service at Ely was in a sorry state on his arrival, with no rehearsals and poor attendance by the choir. Janes' efforts to raise the standards were met with open hostility by the clerical body; his harmonised inflections were declared to be an unpardonable protraction of the length of the service, and he was forced to abandon his design of harmonizing the rest of the Preces and Versicles. His General Confession, however, remained in daily use for some time and was published in 1864 and is known as the \"Ely Confession\".\nHe had an amateur interest in printing and was the first to set pointed Anglican chant in print.\n\n\n== Works ==\nRobert Jane; Organist of Ely Cathedral. The Psalter, Or Psalms of David; together with the Te Deum, Jubilate, Magnificat, Nunc Dimittis, &C. CAREFULLY MARKED AND POINTED, to enable the voices of a Choir to keep exactly together, by singing the same syllable to the same note; and the accents as far as possible made to agree with the accents in the chant; and also to remove the difficulty which individuals generally find who are not accustomed to the chanting of the Psalms.{{cite book}}:  CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list (link)\n\n\n== References ==\nHawkins, Martin (1967). \"Robert Janes: 1806-1866\".

        "content": "The Raids inside Soviet Union during Soviet Afghan War were an effort to foment unrest and rebellion by the Islamic populations of the Soviet Union, starting in late 1984 Director of CIA William Casey encouraged Mujahideen militants to mount sabotage raids inside the Soviet Union, according to Robert Gates, Casey's executive assistant and Mohammed Yousef, the Pakistani ISI brigadier general who was the chief for Afghan operations. The rebels began cross-border raids into the Soviet Union in spring 1985.\n\n\n== 1985 airbase attack ==\nIn August 1985 Afghan Mujahideen bombed a Soviet military airbase in Krasnovodsk, Turkmenistan. Three soldiers were killed.\n\n\n== January 1987 rail attack ==\nIn January 1987 a bomb exploded on a Moscow-bound train in northwestern Uzbekistan, killing 3 citizens. The attack was likely meant to target Soviet troops.\n\n\n== April 1987 raids ==\nIn April 1987 three separate teams of Afghan rebels were directed by the ISI to launch coordinated raids on multiple targets across the Soviet border and extending, in the case of an attack on an Uzbek factory, as deep as over 16 kilometres (10 mi) into Soviet territory.\n\n\n== Kushka raid ==\nOne of the most notable attacks launched by the Mujahideen inside the Soviet Union was the 1988 attack on the town of Kushka. The Afghan Mujahideen captured the town and held it for several days before being forced to withdraw.\n\n\n== Destruction of Termez bridge and barge system ==\nPakistan's ISI requested limpet mines from Britain in the hope of attacking Soviet transport barges on the South bank of the Amu Darya River. MI6 facilitated the attacks which included the Limpets. In this they were successful in destroying a number of barges as well as damaging the bridge pylons spanning the river near Termez.\n\n\n== Involvement of Pakistani special forces ==\nThe Soviet paratroopers found that the Afghan mujaheddin actually wore the black uniforms with rectangular black-yellow-red stripes, and suspected to be Pakistan Army Special Service Group personnel; Pakistan's government has officially denied their involvement. The American author, Aukai Collins, identified the elements as \"Black Storks\" who crossed the border to join the Afghan mujahideen – a claim also backed by American author, David Campbell.: 60–61 \n\n\n== CIA involvement ==\nCIA director William Casey secretly visited Pakistan numerous times to meet with the ISI officers managing the mujahideen, and personally observed the guerrillas training on at least one occasion. Coll reports that\n\nCasey startled his Pakistani hosts by proposing that they take the Afghan war into enemy territory—into the Soviet Union itself. Casey wanted to ship subversive propaganda through Afghanistan to the Soviet Union's predominantly Muslim southern republics. The Pakistanis agreed, and the CIA soon supplied thousands of Korans, as well as books on Soviet atrocities in Uzbekistan and tracts on historical heroes of Uzbek nationalism, according to Pakistani and Western officials.\nCIA also supplied Mujahideen with Weapons and Ammunition as well as Financial aid and this proved to be a crucial factor in the success of these raids.\n\n\n== MI-6 involvement ==\n\nThe UK's role in the Soviet Afghan war entailed direct military involvement not only in Afghanistan but the Central Asian republics of the Soviet Union. From 1984 in conjunction with the CIA and ISI, MI6 helped organize and execute \"scores\" of guerrilla-style attacks. These included rocket attacks on villages in Tajikistan and raids on Soviet airfields, troop supplies and convoys in Uzbekistan which flowed through these areas, some 25 kilometers in these territories.\nThese were the first direct Western attacks on the Soviet Union since the 1950s and they reached their peak in 1986. MI6 directly remitted money into an account of Pakistani leader of Jamaat-e-Islami Qazi Hussain Ahmad who had close links with Hekmatyar & Massoud. MI6's aim was for Ahmad to spread radical and anti-Soviet Islamic literature in the Soviet republics in the hope of rebellions against their Communist governments. These went as far as Chechnya and Bosnia. The uprisings did not occur but the Soviets were concerned about potential uprisings during the war and even threatened retaliation with bombings in Pakistan.\n\n\n== Impact ==\nThe Mujahideen attacks inside the Soviet Union had a significant impact on the Soviet war effort. The attacks forced the Soviet Union to divert resources away from the front lines and to focus on protecting its borders. The attacks also damaged the morale of the Soviet troops and contributed to the Soviet decision to withdraw from Afghanistan in 1989.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSoviet–Afghan war\nOperation Cyclone\nBadaber uprising\nAfghanistan–Pakistan skirmishes\nOperation Curtain\nBattle for Hill 3234\nBattle of Jaji\nSiege of Khost\nOperation Magistral\nFirst Battle of Zhawar\nSecond Battle of Zhawar\nPakistan Soviet air confrontations during the Soviet Afghan war\nKHAD-KGB campaign in Pakistan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==",

        "content": "Tell Yelkhi, is an ancient Near East archaeological site in Diyala Governorate (Iraq). It was examined as part of the Hamrin Dam salvage excavation before it flooded. Other sites a part of that rescue excavation included, Me-Turan, Tell Gubah, Tell Songor, Tellul Hamediyat, Tell Rubeidheh, Tell Madhur, Tell Imlihiye, Tell Rashid, Tell Saadiya and Tell Abada. Some of these sites, including Tell Yelkhi, periodically emerge from the water. The site of Tell Yelhi was settled in the early 3rd millennium BC and occupation continued through the Kassite period late in the 2nd millennium BC. It's name in ancient times is not yet known though Awalki (known during Akkadian, Ur III, and Old Babylonian periods) has been suggested.\n\n\n== Archaeology ==\n\nThe oval mound (220 meters by 170 meters) rises about 12 meters above the plain, having two peaks, one lower than the other, and covers an area of about 4 hectares. The edges of main mound have eroded somewhat, removing some Level I Kassite remains and modern period graves have damaged the site. Tell Yelkhi was excavated for three seasons, from 1977 to 1980, by a team from the Italian Archaeological Expedition led by Antonio Invernizzi and G. Bergamini. Excavation was conducted in two areas A, at the top of the mound exposing Levels I and II, and B, a 30 by 10 meter stratigraphic trench on the southeast side of the mound exposing Levels III, IV and V, VI, VII, and VIII. Additionally, four 4 meter by 4 meter soundings on the tell reached virgin soil exposing Levels IX and X. Excavators defined ten occupation levels. As part of the excavation a photogrammatical survey was conducted. Stratigraphic soundings and minor excavations were also conducted on some of the surrounding area and sites.\n\nLevel IX/X - Early Dynastic, partially below water table. ED cylinder seal found in grave. (Early 3rd millennium BC)\nLevel VIII - Akkadian Empire. Residential occupation with a large industrial area on the western part. (c. 2334 – 2154 BC)\nLevel VI/VII - Ur III. A monumental temple complex with a courtyard and buttressed doorways and containing an altar was built on a foundation of pure sand on Level VI, found on the eastern part. A large rectangular building with pods built on mud brick arches was found on the western part. (c. 2112 BC – c. 2004 BC)\nLevel IV/V - Isin-Larsa period. A large palace with courtyard and about 70 cuneiform tablets holding administrative texts were found on Level V. Burial chambers and graves excavated. A large public building designed for storage was excavated, on Level V, holding many storage jars containing remnants of cereals. Numerous cylindrical beakers were also found in this space. Carbon-14 samples were taken. This building was destroyed by fire and combined with other evidence from the level led the excavators to believe the city was sacked. A high status grave of a tall women with a number of metal ornaments was found in the floor of the main room of the building.(Early 2nd millennium BC)\nLevel III - Old Babylonian and Eshnunna. Forty cuneiform tablets and fragments (literary, administrative and omen texts) were found, associated with a small rectangular temple containing an altar and offering table. Mainly industrial activities. Two phases, IIIa and IIIb. (17th to 18th century BC)\nPeriod of abandonment\nLevel II - Mitanni, Sealand, and Elamite. Remains heavily cut by the Level I foundations. (c. 1525–1400 BC)\nLevel I - Kassite. A large 12 room fortified palace built with thick walls and \"particularly deep foundations\" covers most of the main mound.  It was in use from the early through to the late Kassite period. It was cut by an Islamic cemetery of recent date. (c. 1400-1100 BC) \nFinds included a number of cuneiform tablets.\n Eight tablets were omen texts. An archive, found in the same layer (Level IIIb) mentions the Babylon ruler Ibal-pi-el II. Tablets in a strata contemporary to Level I at the nearby site of Tell Imlihiye carried the names of Kassite rulers Kadasman-Enlil, Kudur-Enlil, Sagarakti-Surias, and Kastilias IV.\nA number of terracotta figurines were excavated in Levels I to VI. In the Kassite remains (Level I) barley, dates, and legumes were found. A bronze fenestrated shaft hole axe was found in a grave in the Isin-Larsa level.\n\n\n=== Tell Kesaran ===\nThis low but large (240 meters by 110 meters in area and about 3 meters in height) site lies across a wadi from Tell Yelkhi, about 1/5 kilometer away. In 1979 and 1980 the Italian Archaeological Expedition led by E. Valtz excavated three adjoining 4 meter by 4 meter trenches on the summit and nine small (1.5 meter by 3 meter) test pits at various points. These established a Kassite period industrial (mainly pottery production) and residential occupation. Minor Late Assyrian occupation was recorded in the form of pottery shards, graves, and a 7th-century BC cylinder seal.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe site was first settled in the Early Dynastic period (possibly the prior Jemdat Nasr period) early in the 3rd century BC with residential occupation continuing into the Akkadian Empire period. Late in the 3rd millennium BC, under the Ur III empire, a large temple and administrative/storage areas were constructed. In the Isin-Larse period, early in the 2nd millennium BC, a large palace was built. Tell Yelkhi then continued in an administrative role into the Old Babylonian period with evidence of Mitanni influence. After a time of abandonment it was resettled under the Kassites at which time a large palace was built. Afterward the site was permanently abandoned.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCities of the ancient Near East\nChronology of the ancient Near East\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nArmstrong, James A., and Hermann Gasche, \"Mesopotamian Pottery.

        "content": "William Odber Raymond (February 3, 1853 – November 24, 1923) was a Canadian clergyman and historian from New Brunswick. While serving as a rector in Saint John, he contributed towards writing and editing historical works of Loyalist settlement in New Brunswick, having spent several years contributing for and serving as the president of the New Brunswick Historical Society. His 1905 writing Glimpses of the Past: History of the River St. John contains a record of what is likely to be the first known Black individual in what is now New Brunswick.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nRaymond was born on February 3, 1853, in Lower Woodstock, New Brunswick, to parents Charles William Raymond and Elizabeth Mary Carman. He attended the University of New Brunswick after receiving the Carleton County scholarship, and received a BA degree in mathematics and natural science in 1876. Afterwards, he studied theology under Bishop John Medley, was ordained as a deacon in 1877 and as a priest the following year. He ministered in Stanley Parish, York County for the next six years, where he married Julia Nelson, later having two children together.In 1884, Raymond became rector of St. Mary's Church in Saint John, during which he became the archdeacon of Saint John in 1908. Alongside his clerical work, Raymond contributed heavily towards historical writings. Over nearly 20 years, he contributed towards the New Brunswick Historical Society, additionally serving as its president for multiple years. Raymond also made heavy contributions towards editing the Winslow Papers, a significant record of Loyalist settlement in New Brunswick.He wrote the 1905 Glimpses of the Past: History of the River St. John, documenting the history of the Saint John River. Additionally, it contains likely the first known record of a Black individual in what is now New Brunswick, who, as described by Raymond as being \"probably the first of his race to set foot within the borders of New Brunswick,\" had been forcibly taken from the New England Colonies to Fort Nashwaak by the French before being taken back during a New England-led attack. In 1910, Raymond issued a revised version.\n\n\n== Later life and death ==\nIn 1916, Raymond retired from his position as a rector due to his declining health. He and his family moved to Toronto after having previously moved to Michigan and Vancouver, where he gave a lecture in the Vancouver Institute. On November 24, 1923, Raymond died in Toronto.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Thomas Young MD, FRCSEd , FRCPE (10 March 1725 - 5 February 1783) was an Edinburgh surgeon and obstetrician who was Professor of Midwifery at the University of Edinburgh. He was the first holder of that post to conduct a course of lectures on midwifery. In 1755 he financed the setting up of a lying-in ward in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, the first of its kind in Scotland and one of the first in Britain. In addition to lectures to medical students he gave lectures to midwives, and provided certification for them. In 1756 he was elected deacon or president of the Incorporation (later Royal College) of Surgeons of Edinburgh.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nThomas Young was born on 10 March 1725. He was the younger son of Janet (née Ross) and her husband George Young (1692–1757), an Edinburgh surgeon who later became a physician and is best known for his empiricism and contributions to philosophy.  Thomas Young  matriculated in Faculty of Arts of the University of Edinburgh in 1741 and again in 1742.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn May 1745 Young was commissioned  regimental surgeon in Lee's (55th) Regiment of Foot. In this capacity he served at the  Battle of Prestonpans where he was taken prisoner after the defeat of the Government Army of General Sir John Cope. Many of those wounded at the battle were cared for in the newly built Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and Young, despite his prisoner status, was among the surgeons who treated them.  He left the army in 1750 and set up in surgical practice in Edinburgh.\nYoung became a Freeman (Fellow) of the Incorporation of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1751 and in that same year started to give lectures on midwifery at the University of Edinburgh. In 1756 he was appointed Professor of Midwifery at the university. Neither of the first two incumbents of the chair, Joseph Gibson and Robert Smith, had given lectures, making Young the first to deliver obstetrics lectures in Edinburgh. \nHis course consisted of some 50 lectures and copies of notes of these made by students survive. He also gave lectures to midwives and certificates were awarded to those who attended. The certificate awarded to Margaret Reid in 1768 reads:\n\nThese are to certify that Margaret Reid attended three courses of my lectures upon the theory and practice of midwifery and also in the Lying-in ward in the Royal Infirmary ... by which means she had the opportunity of operating in all the different sorts of births.\nYoung had personal wealth as a result of his family's brewing business and in 1755 he paid for  'fitting up and furnishing' a four bedded lying-in ward in the attic of the Royal Infirmary, the first such facility in Scotland.  In 1761 he received the degree of MD from the university for a thesis entitled De Lacte, an analysis of the properties of milk and its use in treatment. The following year he became a fellow of The Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh.\nHe was deacon or president of the Incorporation of Surgeons in 1756–57. In 1780 he become joint Professor of Midwifery, sharing the chair with Alexander Hamilton (1739–1802). Young invested some of his wealth in property development, building several large houses in what was initially called Young Street, later renamed New Street, where he lived in later life.\n\n\n== Family and later life ==\nHis elder brother George Young had intended to pursue a career in medicine, enrolling at the University of Leiden in 1739. He married Margaretha Cassa in 1739 against his parents' wishes and was instructed by his father to return to Edinburgh, which he did, deserting his wife. His father imposed a declaratory of silence or gagging order and George junior went into hiding. He subsequently divorced his wife and does not seem to have continued with his medical career.\nOn 5 March 1754 Thomas Young married Barbara Gibson. They had no children. Thomas Young died on 5 February 1783 and is buried in Greyfriars Churchyard, Edinburgh.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Girl Langa Langchung and the Rooster is a Tibetan tale published as part of the compilation of The Golden Corpse (Tibetan: Mi ro gser sgrung), a compilation of tales popular in Tibet. Scholars relate it to the cycle of the Animal as Bridegroom or The Search for the Lost Husband: a human woman marries a supernatural husband in animal form and, after losing him, has to seek him out.\n\n\n== Origin ==\nThe Golden Corpse is a compilation of Indo-Tibetan stories that was later brought to Mongolia and translated to Mongolic languages. The collection is known in India as Vetala Pañcaviṃśati, in Tibet as Ro-sgrung, in Mongolia as Siditü kegür, and in Oirat as Siddhi kǖr.\nIn this regard, Mongolian linguist Tsendiin Damdinsüren noted the existence of two Tibetan compilations of Vetala tales, one with 13 chapters and the other with 21. Also, both versions were mentioned in the work The Book of the Son, written in 11th century. Lastly, the divergence in contents between the Indian Vetala and the Tibetan versions, according to Damdinsuren, may indicate the latter were original works, instead of an adaptation or translation. In the same vein, according to Tibetologist Françoise Robin, there are more than 20 versions of the compilation in the Tibetan-speaking zone alone, and their common versions contain between thirteen and twenty-five stories, with some even reaching up to 75 tales.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nIn this tale, an old couple lives with their three daughters and their cattle of sheep. One day, the husband goes to graze the cattle, when a demon appears, kills the man, and wears his face as a disguise. The false husband goes back home with a story that he met a potential rich suitor for his daughters and gives the woman some fat to be cooked for their meal. Unaware that the fat belongs to her dead husband, the woman roasts it, but a voice warns her the fat is her dead husband's. The demon's next victims are the couple's elder and middle daughter, whom he kills on the hill and brings their fat for the woman to cook, lying that they are sheep's fat to celebrate their daughters' betrothal to rich men. After he brings the middle daughter's fat, the woman suggests they live with their youngest daughter, instead of sending her away to be married, but the false husband suggests she is married off before the couple dies. The next day, the false husband takes the youngest daughter, Langa Langchung, to the hill to be killed off, and tells her to wait there while he goes to search for her suitor. Suddenly, a little dog comes out of the bushes and asks to be given food in exchange for secrets: a mouthful for a secret. Langa Langchung shares with the dog the meal her mother prepared for her, and the dog reveals three secrets: the girl's father is a demon who killed her true father and sisters and hid their skulls nearby. In addition, the dog gives her a pot with instructions on how to escape the demon: roll the pot down a hill and follow it, paying no heed to the demon's calls for her to return.\nLanga follows the pot until it stops by some sacks of cow dung. Underneath them, she finds a trapdoor, which leads to a ladder, and further down leads to a storeroom where a rooster bids her enter and sate her hunger and thirst. The next day, the rooster tells her to wear some fine clothes and enjoy herself at a nearby gala. She does exactly that and leaves the storeroom. After she leaves, the rooster removes its birdskin, becomes a youth, and joins the others at the gala. Langa celebrates with the other revellers and spots the youth among the guests. The youth then makes a return to the storeroom and puts on the rooster disguise to welcome Langa. The girl tells the rooster she met a handsome youth named Japho Tsilu at the gala, who greatly interested her. Some days later, the rooster tells Langa there is another gala which she should attend. Langa also attends the gala, and so does Japho Tsilu in human form. Langa returns from the second gala and comments that a \"rooster\" Tsilu was the most handsome man there, and she was the most beautiful woman. Later, the rooster announces there is yet another gala, which it bids Langa to attend. The girl, suspecting the rooster is \"Tsalu\" from the gala, pretends to go to the gala and hides in a corner: she watches as the rooster takes off the rooster's skin to become the human youth and goes to join the people at the fair. Langa, who stayed behind, burns the rooster's skin. Japho returns from the fair and finds that Langa burnt his rooster disguise. In despair, he tells her it could not have been burnt for another ten years and now they cannot be together, but there is something Langa can do: he gives her his tutelary deity and tells her to go to a house that lies facing the East, where its dogs will recognize her and his mother will welcome her in.\nLanga does as instructed and walks to Japho's mother's house with the deity, introducing herself as a beggar woman whose father and elder sister were devoured by a demon. Japho's mother says her son has been missing for five years, and takes Langa in. Sometime later, Langa has a dream wherein a lama asks what Langa wants. She explains she wants the ability to reach out to Japho Tsalu, her husband, and the lama says he can help her. The next morning, she feels she is pregnant, and Japho's mother questions her about the child's father. Langa simply answers about her auspicious dreams, and none of the servants is her baby's father. Days later, a man in a red horsem red garments and accompanied by a red dog appears at the woman's house: it is Japho Tsalu, who asks Langa if she has a soft pillow, a good blanket, and a good bed, and if she is eating nourishing food. Langa says she is sleeping on a belt pillow, with no woolen blanket, nor soft mattress. Japho Tsalu then explains that the demons caught his soul after the rooster's skin and made to be their servant, first their tea man, then their chamber master, until being demoted to horse herder. This new position allows him to meet with Langa away from the demons' view.\nThe next day, Japho's mother is informed by the servants there was some one in the room with Langa, and questions her about it. Langa admits she met a man she fell in love with, but her mistake separated them. Out of pity, Japho's mother moves Langa to better accommodations. The next time Japho visits her, Langa says she is sleeping in a soft and comfortable bed, and wishes he could be there permanently. However, Japho explains there is a guardian of the demons that is impossible to escape, but if one is to come for him, he can be saved. That same night, Langa has another dream with the lama, and he gives her a turquoise and instructions on how to rescue Japho Tsalu: she is to go to a hill and hold a stag's horn, place the turquoise on her mouth and keep meditating on the lama. She is to pay no attention to a hundred red knights galloping from the right and another hundred from the left, and a large red knight with a scorpion head that will come to hinder her.\nThe next day, Langa goes to the hill with the stag's horn and starts the ritual according to the lama's instructions. Meanwhile, the lama turns into a blue horse and goes to retrieve Japho Tsalu while the latter is fetching water from a pond. The lama takes Japho back home, while Langa holds the fort and medidates on the lama, the red knights and the scorpion-headed man trying to stop her, to no avail, since she keeps her concentration long enough for the creatures to cease their efforts and leave them be. After the demons leave, Langa reunites with Japho Tsalu, and his mother faints with happiness at seeing him safe and sound. Langa marries king Japho Tsalu and they rule the kingdom.\n\n\n== Analysis ==\n\n\n=== Tale type ===\nThe tale has been related by scholarship to the international tale type ATU 425, \"The Search for the Lost Husband\", of the international Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index. These tales refer to a marriage between a human woman and a husband of supernatural origin that appears in animal shape. Sometimes the human wife tries to break the enchantment by destroying the husband's animal skin, but he vanishes and she must undergo a penance to get her husband back.\n\n\n== Variants ==\nAccording to Hungarian scholar Lazsló Lörincz, variants of the story appear in Tibetan Ro-sgrung, either in compilations of thirteen tales or of twenty-one. Despite this difference, Lörincz considered both tales to be \"identical\".\nIn the version with 21 tales, the story appears as tale nr. 9, Bu-mo Slaṅ-ṅa slaṅ-čhun srin-mo'i kha-nas thar-te rgyal-srid bzuṅ-ba'i le'u bzugs-so (\"The Tale about how the maiden Slan-na fled the demon's mouth and gained the throne)\": the heroine's father and sisters are devoured by a demon, but she escapes with the aid a dog and meets a talking rooster; the rooster is an enchanted human whose disguise she burns and causes him to fall under the power of demons; with the help of deity Rta-mgrin (Hayagriva), transmogrified to a horse, she saves her beloved.\nIn the versions with 13 stories, it appears as tale numbered 7, titled Bya-šubs-čan-gyi le’u-ste (\"The Tale of the Man in Birdskin\"): the heroine meets the rooster, who is a man under the birdskin; she burns the birdskin and he comes under the power of demons; she fashions a new birdskin for him. Lörincz distinguished between literary and folkloric (oral) versions of this narrative: in the Tibetan redaction, the bird husband is identified as a rooster; in the literary versions, the three girls search for the lost cattle, whereas in oral versions the cattle just disappears.\n\n\n=== The Feathered Prince ===\nIn a variant translated as \"Царевич в птичьей оболочке\" (\"The Prince in Bird Skin\") or The Feathered Prince, three orphaned sisters live together and earn their living by milking their female buffalo and selling its milk and butter. One day, the animal disappears, and the elder sister goes looking for it. After a while, she sits by a rock near a cave. A little bird appears to her and begs for some food, and asks her to marry it. The elder sister refuses and returns home. The next day, the middle sister goes to look for the animal and rests by the same stone, and the same white bird propositions her, but she declines. Lastly, the youngest sister agrees to marry the white bird, and he directs her into the cave. Inside, magnificent and richly decorated rooms appear before her with every door she opens. At last, the little bird perches upon a couch and tells her that their buffalo was devoured by an evil raksha. The girl begins to live there as the white bird's wife, tidying the place and preparing the food. Some time later, a festival is held in a nearby village, with musicians, equestrian games, and all sorts of amusement. The white bird's wife goes to the festival, and sees a handsome youth on a gray horse, who gazes at her. The girl leaves the festival and meets an old woman. The girl pours out her woes to her, lamenting over the fact that her husband is just a little bird, but the old woman reassures her that the youth at the festival was her husband, and that she only has to burn his bird disguise the next time. The girl follows the old woman's instructions the next day, and burns the bird skin. The same night, her husband (in human form) comes home and asks her about the bird skin. The girl tells him she burned the birdskin, and the man reveals he is a prince, and that the birdskin was to protect him from an evil witch. Saying this, a whirlwind comes and takes the prince. The girl tries to find him and wanders through valleys and deserts, until she finds him one day near a temple, carrying jugs of water and wearing faded boots. The prince tells her to get feathers from all species of bird for a new bird coat, and, once she has fashioned it, she must chant a special prayer for him to return to her. Saying his, he disappears. The girl returns to their cave palace and gathers all feathers she can must, fashions a new bird skin and chants the correct chant to summon her husband back to her. He appears and both live happily.\n\n\n=== Bird who Turned into a Prince ===\nIn a variant published by Tibetologist David MacDonald with the title The Story of the Bird who turned into a Prince, in the land of Mo-tshul, an old farmer lives with his three daughters; the three sisters pass by a red door, a gold door and a turquoise door and meet the bird on a throne; the youngest sister marries the bird and burns his feathered cloak; she does penance to try to save her husband by standing at a door and turning a \"devil-stick\" or \"devil-rod\"; after her husband vanishes, she finds him in the summit of a hill, and he explains he must wear out a pair of boots by traveling at the behest of the devils. She saves her husband by fashioning a new feathered cloak and by saying fervent prayers, until he appears at their door.\n\n\n=== The White Bird's Wife ===\nAuthor Eleanore Myers Jewett translated the tale as The White Bird's Wife and sourced it from Tibet. In her translation, the youngest daughter is named Ananda.\n\n\n=== The White Rooster ===\nAuthors Fredrick Hyde-Chambers and Audrey Hyde-Chambers translated a Tibetan tale with the title The White Rooster. In this tale, a widow lives with her three daughters, Pema, Tsokyi and Dekyi, the three equally beautiful. They live in a small house near the edge of a lake, and take their yaks to graze. One day, Pema takes the yaks to pasture, but hears a loud sound and gets distracted. When she turns to check on the animals, they have disappears. Desperate, the girl searches high and low for the animals, and enters a cave; inside, she finds jewels and finely decorated doors she passes through, until she finds a large throne room at the end of the cave, a large white rooster sat on a cushion. The rooster greets Pema and says he can help her find the missing yaks, as long as she agrees to be the bird's wife. Pema declines his offer and returns home empty-handed. The next day, the middle sister, Tsokyi, traces her sister's footsteps to the rooster and is also proposed with marriege, which she also refuses. Finally, the youngest sister, Dekyi, goes to the cave to meet the rooster and agrees to become his wife. The rooster points to the place where she can find the roosters, and bids her returns before sunset, now that she is to become the rooster's wife. It happens thus: Dekyi's family retrieves the yak herd, while she goes to live in the cave with the rooster. Some time later, a horse-racing contest is announced to he held at a nearby town, with festivities and a gathering of people. Dekyi herself goes to the events, wearing fine clothes and the people barely recognize her. During the races, a mysterious rider on an ice-blue horse beats the competition and gazes at Dekyi with some familiarity. Dekyi goes home to the rooster. On the last day of the festival, Dekyi meets with an old woman and tells her about her marriage, to which the old woman gives a cryptic message about things not being what they appear. Dekyi then goes back to the cave and does not find her husband, but a large rooster skin strewn about on the ground. She then realizes the rider at the race is her husband in human form, and decides to burn the rooster skin to keep him human forever. Next, the human rooster comes back and asks her about the skin, and learns his wife destroyed. Despairing at the situation, he explains that as long as he had the rooster skin, he could be protected from the demons, for he was cursed to rooster skin when he refuses to become their slave. Dekyi asks how she can still save him, and is told she is to hold a candle and bang on a door night and day for a whole week. She follows his instructions and manages to stay awake for 6 days, but falls asleep and drops the candle. When she comes to, she notices that her husband is nowhere to be found, and lives in the cave. At the end of the tale, she finds her husband again during a walk. He reveals to her he is now a slave to the demons and can never return to her, but insists she takes the jewels in their cave and go back to her family. It happens thus, and Dekyi goes back to live with her family.\n\n\n=== Langa and Jatsalu ===\nIn a Tibetan tale titled Langa and Jatsalu, also contained in a published version of Ro-srung (2003), a family of four (father, mother and two daughters) lives in a valley. One day, the father goes to graze sheep down in the valley, when a sinpo shapeshifter appears, kills the man and wears its skin. He passes himself off as the father and tells then a distant king is looking for a bride, and suggests his eldest daughter should go. The mother adorns her elder daughter, who accompanies the false father down to the valley. The false father devours the elder daughter, and goes back home with a new lie: the king's brother wishes to marry their younger daughter, Langa. The mother prepares Langa for the journey, and the false father goes with her down a mountain pass. Seeing so many people there, the false father leaves Langa on the road. While she waits, a little white dog appears and asks for food, in exchange for telling the girl three secrets. Langa feeds the little animal, which reveals the girl's fahter is a shapeshifter, directs her to a cave where her father and elder sister's bones are, and gives her a plate to use to distract the shapeshifter before he has a chance to devour her. After the dog leaves, the sinpo comes back to devour her, but, following the animal's advice, she throws the plate and it rolls down the slope. She follows the plate until it stops at a burlap sack filled with cow dung. She lifts the sack and finds a pair of doors that lead underground. Langa goes down the stairs and passes by a large iron door and a large golden door, until she reaches a splendidly decorated throne room. Inside the room, a talking rooster greets her and offers food and a warm bed for her, telling her to use a small door near the bedroom wall. Langa accepts the rooster's offer, eats and sleeps for a bit, then goes out the small door: when she exits it, it leads her to a crowded marketplace. Meanwhile, the rooster at the throne room takes off his birdskin, becomes a handsome youth and rides a horse to the marketplace. Langa and the rider, named Jatsalu, spot each other and fall in love with each other, while the crowd shouts at Jatsalu to come see them. Jatsalu throws ashes and dust at the people, and drops a sack of brown sugar to distract them, then makes his way back to the throne room to put on the rooster disguise again. Langa comes back from the marketplace and comments with the rooster about the events. The next day, she opens and closes the small door to trick the rooster, and spies through a hole in the wall: the rooster takes off its skin to become Jatsalu, and makes his way to the market. While he is away, Langa burns the rooster skin. After Jatsalu returns from the market, he finds Langa, who tells him she loves him, but burned the rooster skin. Jatsalu despairs at the fact, for the skin served to protect him from his enemies, and they will find him again, so they must make the most of the night. The next day, Jatsalu directs Langa to his parents' compound, which is guarded by ferocious dogs, but she can bypass them by performing an act of kindness and keep a state of mindfulness at all times. Langa follows his instructions and reaches his parents' large house. Jatsalu's mother takes her in as a servant and comments that her own son has disappeared. That same night, Langa has a dream about the little dog, which predicts that a dransong truth-sayer will come and she must heed his words. Some time later, the house's servants notice Langa is pregnant and gossip about it to their mistress, lying that the girl must have had a dalliance with a male servant or with a shepherd. Langa denies it, and Jatsalu's mother lets her stay, though noticing the girl is indeed pregnant. Later, Langa has another dream where a rider on a red horse appears with a red dog and asks Langa if she has nice accommodations; the girl replies to the rider in the vision she does not. The next morning, Langa tells Jatsalu's mother about her son, and the woman deducts he has been kidnapped by a tsen body-snatcher. After learning of Langa's relationship with her son, the woman places her in a better room. That same night, Jatsalu comes to Langa's new bedroom and explains the tsens have made him to herd their horses and next to be their water carrier, which allowed him to sneak out and alert his wife, saying only through her skills can he be saved, then goes back to the tsens. Langa then prays fervently, and the dransong truth-sayer appears in her dream to guide her, instructing her on how to proceed. The next day, she finds deer's antlers and a turquoise in a bush, which she takes and goes to a juniper tree, and hides herself amidst some lower branches. She places the turquoise in her mouth and hold the antlers above her head, as the dransong manifests above the antlers. Langa holds her position as the tsens appear with their horse herd and circle the juniper tree, while the dransong changes shape into a blue horse and waits near a blue pond. Jatsalu appears and goes to give water to the blue horse, which says he has come to rescue him. Jatsalu mounts on the horse and escapes back to his parents' house, while Langa keeps her mindfulness among the tsens. A giant scorpion creature tries to menace her, but the girl holds her spiritual concentration and dismisses the scorpion. At last, the tsens vanish whence they came, and Langa is taken to Jatsalu's house to live with him.\n\n\n=== Other tales ===\nTibetologist August Hermann Francke, in a 1923 article, reported the existence of Tibetan manuscript from the Bar-bog family from Lahul. The manuscript, titled Ňos-grub-can-gyi-sgruns, contained 13 tales, the seventh named Bya-shubs-rgyal-po (German: der König in Vogelgestalt; English: \"The King in Bird-form\").\nAccording to Lörincz, M. K. Kolmaš provided the Eötvös Loránd University with a microfilm of a xylography from East Tibet. The xylographic version contained 16 tales, the ninth tale titled Rgyal-bu bya-šubs-čan-kyi leu'ste (French: Histoire du prince au corps d'oiseau; English: \"Story of the Prince with the body of a bird\").\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Bird Lover\nThe White Bird and His Wife\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

It will be served by the Port Klang Line of the KTM Komuter service that forms part of the Klang Valley Integrated Transit System. The station will include facilities such as park and ride, disabled-friendly utilities, ticket kiosks, restrooms, elevators and taxi stands.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn August 2023, Railway Assets Corporation (RAC) and IDP Industrial Development Sdn Bhd had signed an agreement with UOA Development Berhad to develop a new railway station along the KTM line, while the former will undertake the construction of it to further integrate with its existing development. The signing ceremony was witnessed by Transport Minister Anthony Loke and Segambut's MP Hannah Yeoh. Previously, the land was first earmarked in 2016 to be constructed as a KTM station along with the development of UOA's United Point Residence.The station is expected to be operational by November 2025. Once completed, it will serve the surrounding neighborhoods of Taman Cuepacs, Taman Sri Segambut, Taman Segambut Aman as well as Taman Sri Sinar and will be directly connected to United Point via an overhead bridge.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKTMB routes",

        "content": "Native Heart is an album by the American musician Tony Williams, released in 1990. Williams supported the album with North American and UK tours. Native Heart peaked in the top five of Billboard's Top Jazz Albums chart.\n\n\n== Production ==\nWilliams composed and arranged all of the album's songs. He was backed by pianist Mulgrew Miller, trumpeter Wallace Roney, bass players Bob Hurst and Ira Coleman, and saxophonist Bill Pierce. Williams had worked with Miller, Roney, and Pierce since returning to recording, in 1985. The quintet had rehearsed the songs many times before entering the studio; Williams also worked on them in his spare time. \"Juicy Fruit\" contains a snippet of \"Watermelon Man\". \"Liberty\" is a Williams solo track.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe Chicago Tribune called the album a \"swinging, if slightly emotionally detached recording.\" Spin considered it to be \"one of the most reassuringly musical records to emerge from the hard-bop renaissance.\" The Gazette noted that \"Williams writes long, intricate arrangements that—along with his tendency to bash the stuffing out of his drums—have tended to suffocate his young employees on past outings... Here, he still plays too loud too often, but everybody except Miller mounts an effective counterattack.\"\nThe Los Angeles Times concluded that \"the title track's moody, rainy day flavor and the sassy but overextended blues strut of 'Juicy Fruit' are high spots on an album that's long on expert craftsmanship but a bit short on dynamic flair.\" The Windsor Star determined that \"the Williams splash and verve are at the centre of all the music but it finally does not wholly free itself from its laid-back bounce.\" The Philadelphia Inquirer said that \"the music has all the Zen-like peace of new-age without the mind-numbing sameness.\"\nAllMusic deemed Native Heart \"the more adventurous side of straight-ahead jazz.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Conocybe subpallida is a species of mushroom-producing fungus in the family Bolbitiaceae.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIt was described in 1991 by the mycologist Manfred Enderle who classified it as Conocybe subpallida.\nIn 1992 the species Conocybe subalpina was described by Rolf Singer and Anton Hausknecht as a reclassification of Singer's 1989 Conocybe mesospora var. subalpina. However this species is now considered a synonym as it was reclassified as Conocybe subpallida var. subalpina in 2003 by Everhardus Johannes Maria Arnolds.\n\n\n== Description ==\nCap: 3.5–5 cm wide, starting hemispherical when young then convex to conical before expanding to flat convex. The hygrophanous surface is very pale ochre or light cream with faint striations and a darker brown centre. Stem: 6.5–8 cm long and 3 mm thick with a slightly narrower apex and wide base. The surface is light cream coloured with striations and a pruinose coating over the entire length and a slightly tomentose base. It is fragile and becomes more light brown with age. Gills: Close to crowded, adnate with a small tooth, cinnamon coloured and developing a saffron tinge with age and a lighter edge. Spores: 10–11.6 x 5.8-6.8 μm. Ellipsoid to elongated ovoid to amygdaliform with inconspicuous germ pore and apicule. Ochre-yellow in a 10% solution of ammonia. Basidia: 4 spored.\n\n\n== Habitat and distribution ==\nThe specimens studied by Enderle were found growing in a cow pasture between the remains of old grass, wood and cow manure as well as on the side of roads by forests and in grass under trees.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Conquest of Jangladesh is the military expedition of Rao Bika Rathore against the tribes that inhabited Jangladesh, where Rao Bika successfully conquered Jangladesh and established a new state Bikaner.\n\n\n== Background ==\nRao Bika was the son of Rao Jodha, who established Jodhpur. Rao Bika left Marwar with his uncle Rawat Kandhal and 300 soldiers on September 30, 1465, to establish his own kingdom. Jangladesh was inhabited by Jat, Bhatti, Qaimkhani and Johiya tribes. During his journey Bika took the blessings of Karni mata.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nRao Bika after defeating the tribes of Jangladesh, carved out his own kingdom named Bikaner which is estimated to consist land area of 40,000 sq miles with 3000 villages. Bikaner during Rao Bika included areas of Sirsa, Ladnu, Bhatner, Bhatinda, Singhana, Rini, Nohar and Pugal. Most of Jat chieftans in Jangladesh had to accept Rathore suzerainty due to Rao Bika's conquest of Jangladesh. Later, Rao Bika saved Godara Jats from Bhatis too.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Belmont Plaza Hotel was a hotel in New York City at 49th Street and 541-555 Lexington Avenue, across the street from the Waldorf Astoria.\nIt was purchased by real estate developer and hotelier Alfred Kaskel in the fall of 1945. The Glass Hat Club at the Belmont was a popular supper club, where Dean Martin  and Jerry Lewis were performing when they met in August 1944.\nIn August 1964, the land on which the hotel was situated had been sold to the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company for $4.4 million, but that they leased it back immediately to Kaskel and his Belplaza Corporation.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Belmont Plaza was a 15-story 800-room hotel opposite the Waldorf Astoria.\nIn an October 1937 LIFE magazine article it mentioned that the Belmont Plaza was the \"Home of the famous new Glass Hat\".  The Glass Hat Club was a popular supper club at the hotel which had a capacity of 444 people and as of 1947 charged a minimum fee of $2.50 for entry for shows put on between 8:30 pm and midnight. The bar of the Glass Hat was designed by Jac Lessman in a circular style, to give the room a \"feeling of cheerfulness and informality\".\n\nIn November 1942, Billboard mentioned that Jack Marshall made his debut at the Glass Hat club and had a nine-week stint performing there. The Glass Hat Club was where Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis were performing where they met in August 1944. According to Lewis, the two men met initially in the lobby of the Belmont Plaza where Martin approached him and said \"Hey, I saw your act, you're a funny kid\". Martin was singing at the club at the time and the two happened to be on the same bill, though the two wouldn't start performing together as a duo until the 500 Club in Atlantic City.\nAlfred Kaskel and his Carol Management Corporation purchased the Belmont Plaza hotel in the fall of 1945. Kaskel was the head of the Montrose Industrial Bank of Brooklyn at the time. Billboard noted that up until his purchase, the Glass Hat Club had operated on a much more modest budget.\nIn 1950, it was reported that an initial 200 rooms of the hotel had recently been renovated; at the time it was described as a \"700-suite hotel\". \n\nLuncheons and receptions at the Belmont Plaza were still held in the \"Moderne Room\" and conferences in the \"Baroque Room\" of the hotel in the 1950s.\nBy 1959, it was reported that the hotel \"leases to the Pick Hotel chain for an annual rental of $ 332,750\".\nIn August 1964, The New York Times reported that the land on which the hotel was situated had been sold to the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company for $4.4 million, but that they leased it back immediately to Kaskel and his Belplaza Corporation.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Destinies of the Soul (published in French as Des destinées de l'âme) is an 1879 book notable for being bound in human skin. It was written by Arsène Houssaye and published by C. Lévi in Paris. The book was owned by Ludovic Bouland before it was acquired by the Harvard Library in 1934. The book was not confirmed to be bound in human skin until 2014. In 2024, Harvard University removed the skin and placed it in storage due to ethical considerations.\n\n\n== History ==\nHoussaye was friends with Bouland and gifted him the book after writing it. The book was not bound in human skin until its acquisition by Bouland, who believed that \"a book about the human soul deserved to have a human covering\". He used the skin of a deceased woman in a French psychiatric hospital, where he was a medical student. After his death in 1934, it was acquired by Harvard University, although not formally so until 1954. The book entered the collection alongside a note detailing its origins and instructions for how to preserve human skin.In 2014, when researchers were able to confirm that the material used was indeed human skin, Harvard said it was \"good news for fans of anthropodermic bibliopegy, bibliomaniacs and cannibals alike\". The advent of peptide mass fingerprinting made such a confirmation possible, as it allowed researchers to distinguish human skin from other materials like sheepskin. Destinies of the Soul was one of three books tested by the university for human skin and was the only one to have it. In 2023, Harvard performed an ethical review of materials within its collection and concluded that it had failed in its stewardship responsibilities. This review was prompted by a 2022 report about human remains within the university's possession. Before this ethical review, access to the book was unrestricted and possibly used in hazing rituals. As of 2024, Harvard University has removed the human skin from the book and placed it in storage as a temporary measure before disposal.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of books bound in human skin\nDark Archives\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nReport of the Steering Committee on Human Remains in University Museum Collections",

        "content": "The Onondaga Historical Association (OHA) is a private nonprofit entity that operates as a research center on the history of Onondaga County, with museums at multiple locations. Founded in 1862, OHA's mission is to preserve the history of Central New York and encourage the Onondaga County community to appreciate and utilize its history. OHA was first founded amid the Civil War to preserve history at a time it was \"washing in and out of recognition,\" according to a 2013 Syracuse Post-Standard article.\nOHA runs the Skä•noñh: Great Law of Peace Center, which preserves Haudenosauneee culture.\nOHA's building has undergone a building change and multiple renovations.\nIn a 2022 Post-Standard story —The OHA has been telling Syracuse’s story and preserving its history since 1862 — Robert Searing, OHA's curator of history, discusses the origins of the Onondaga Historical Association. The article discusses some of the founders, such as Homer Sweet, and the original location of the museum in the Corinthian Block.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Onondaga Historical Association was officially incorporated into New York state in 1863.\nOHA's original building at 311 Montgomery St. was built in 1906. In 1980, OHA purchased 321 Montgomery St., which was previously the New York Telephone Building and is OHA's main location as of 2024.\nIn 2005, OHA's building was sold to Russ Andrews, a Syracuse businessman, and his wife, Linda Henley, for $80,000. Until its renewal was shown to the public in a 2011 ribbon cutting ceremony, the building was \"bricked up for years.\"\n\n\n== Museums ==\nThe Onondaga Historical Association maintains several different locations. The Onondaga Historical Museum and Gift Gallery store are located in downtown Syracuse, New York, along with the Richard and Carolyn Wright Research Center. These locations, as well as the OHA administrative office, can be found on 321 Montgomery Street. \nThe Onondaga Historical Museum and Gift Gallery operate Wednesday through Friday from 10am to 4pm and Saturday and Sunday from 11am to 4pm. The cost of admission is $5 but is free for children 12 and under.\nThe Richard and Carolyn Wright Research Center is open Wednesday through Friday from 10am to 4pm and on Saturday 11am to 4pm. The cost of admission is $10 but is free for children 12 and under.\nLiverpool, New York houses additional locations such as the Skä•noñh – Great Law of Peace Center and Gift Gallery and the St. Marie Among the Iroquois Mission Site Museum. These sites can be found at Onondaga Lake Park.\nThe Skä•noñh – Great Law of Peace Center is a location where the culture of the Haudenosaunee in central New York is taught and celebrated. The center and gift shop are open Wednesday through Friday from 10am to 4pm and on Saturday 11am to 4pm.\nSt. Marie Among the Iroquois Mission Site generally remains open from May through October. The operating hours are Wednesday through Friday from 10am to 4pm and Saturday from 11am to 4pm.\n\n\n== Founders ==\nDr. Henry D. Didama = Didama was a physician who was involved with St. Joseph's Hospital from its origins.\nJames Noxon = Noxan was a lawyer who eventually went on to represent New York state as a Senator.\nHomer DeLois Sweet = Sweet was a civil engineer and map maker who surveyed Onondaga County.\nJohn A. Green = Green was a businessman who worked in grocery retail.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Battle of Rabat Karim (Persian: نبرد رباط کریم, December 27, 1915) was fought by the Iranian people, around Rabat Karim (near Tehran) during the First World War under the command of Heydar Latifiyan against the occupation of Iran by Russian forces.\n\n\n== Preparations ==\n\n\n=== Before World War I ===\nThe Persian campaign or invasion of Iran was a series of military conflicts between the Ottoman Empire, British Empire and Russian Empire in various areas of what was then neutral Qajar Iran, beginning in December 1914 as part of the Middle Eastern Theatre of World War I.\nPersia declared its neutrality during the outbreak of the First World War. Despite this, the country quickly became affected by the pre-war rivalry between the Allies and the Central Powers. Foreign interests in Persia were primarily based on the country's strategic location between British India, Imperial Russia, Afghanistan and the Ottoman Empire, as well as the country's oil reserves, which were first discovered on 26 May 1908. \nIn the Anglo-Russian Treaty of 1907, the Russian and British governments agreed to divide Persia into three regions, with the Russians laying claim to northern Persia, the part adjacent to their previously conquered territories in the Transcaucasia, and the British claimed the south which bordered British India (a third region was left as a buffer zone). The 1907 treaty capped off several decades of the Great Game between the Russians and the British. The treaty was signed at a time when German imperial expansion into the region was underway and the agreement served both Russia and Britain by providing a counterweight to increasing German regional influence and potential future expansion into the region.\n\n\n=== Beginning of Persian campaign ===\n\nRussia was Iran's northern neighbor at that time and had many wars with Iran during the Qajar period. The British forces in the south and southeast of Iran had caused dissatisfaction among the Iranians by occupying parts of the Iranian soil under the pretext of protecting the interests of the Iranians.\nDuring the First World War, despite the official announcement of Iran's neutrality, two countries, England and Russia, violated territorial sovereignty due to lack of trust.\nWhen the Russian forces were advancing towards Tehran after signing the secret agreement of 1915 with England under the pretext of protecting the security of the embassy during Muharram, Mustofi al-Mamalek was under the influence of some of the million and following the democratic lawyers and distinguished men such as the late Modares believed that in order to eradicate Russian and British influence and get rid of their influence, Ottomans and Germany should be resorted to in the middle of the war because they have less history of colonialism in Iran. At the same time, they were considered the final victors of the war.\n\n\n== Forces ==\n\n\n=== Persian forces ===\nThe Persian forces were established around certain districts, and not one single force. Each district furnished its own battalion and each province had several battalions. Each district depending on the tribal grouping furnished one or sometimes two battalions usually under their own chiefs. The strength of the battalions was from 600 to 800. They had artillery batteries whose strength ranged from four to eight guns. Irregular troops amounted to about 50,000 in each district, with ranks composed of tribal horsemen and an uncertain number of footmen, all poorly armed. It was not uncommon of the chiefs, who controlled the battalions, to change sides. Some of these forces were Qashqai Tribesmen, Tangistani Tribesmen, Laristani Tribesmen, and Khamseh tribesmen. The Persian central government also had the Persian Central Government Gendarmerie, which had Swedish officers and consisted of about 6,000 troops. Only 2,000 of the 6,000 were mounted. They were in six regiments, each of nine battalions, and their armament included Mauser rifles, twelve machine guns, and four mountain guns. The Persian forces were dispersed at Tehran, Kazvin (Ghazvin), and Hamadan with the objective of keeping the country's main roads, which covered an estimated distance of 930 miles, under Persian control.\n\n\n=== Russia Forces ===\nRussia had long since established forces in the region. The Persian Cossack Brigade and a small contingent of the Russian Caucasus Army under the Armenian General Tovmas Nazarbekian was stationed there. The Cossack Brigade consisted of eight squadrons, a small battalion of infantry and a horse battery of six Krupp guns; their total strength did not exceed 2,000. Besides this force, in 1912 Russia obtained the formal consent of the Persian government to the formation of a similar Cossack Brigade at Tabriz under Russian officers. The consent of the government was given as a condition for the withdrawal of Russian troops in Iranian Azerbaijan which, at the onset of the Great War, Russia did not. The Russians also moved one detachment of Armenian volunteer units under the command of Andranik Ozanian to this region.\n\tForces engaged at the Campaign\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Rulers of battle ===\n\n\n=== Senior commanders ===\n\n\n== Battle zone ==\nRobat Karim (Persian: رباطكريم) is a city in the Central District of Robat Karim County, Tehran province, Iran, serving as capital of both the county and the district.\nOne of the main reasons for the formation of the battle of Rabat Karim, the location of this city on the Silk Road and Khorasan pilgrimage route to Baghdad can be mentioned, and on the other hand, after Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar chose Tehran as the capital and he encouraged its construction and settlement. Tehran became the center of governmental and governmental affairs, the commuting of people to Tehran to meet their needs and perform administrative work from different parts of the country increased, and people from the southern regions of Iran, caravans, merchants and military units had to go from Rabat Karim, which is on the Saveh road to Tehran. It was true that they were passing through, which gradually attracted immigrants from various cities to Rabat Karim.\n\n\n== Last fight ==\nThe Russian army from one side reaches the village of Kolmeh, which is located between the Robat Karim road and Tehran, and the local fighters are surrounded from three sides. The Russians start bombarding the area from almost a mile, until in the evening, the strongholds of the local Batop fighters are bombarded, everyone survives. But in the evening, the infantry riders of the Russian army came closer and the war with swords started and after a bloody clash, seventy people were killed.\nHeyder Latifiyan, the senior commander, was killed in this battle.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAhmad Matin-Daftari (later Prime Minister of Iran) mentions the tragic fate and death of these resistance forces in his memoirs.\nAfter the defeat of Robat Karim's popular resistance and his death, Abdul Hossein Farmanfarma expressed his regret through a telegram sent to Isfahan and told the National Defense Committee that: In addition to the 7-8-year exams and the Saveh and Rabat Karim exams, I will sit for one more exam in Isfahan and forcefully invite the foreign army to the middle of Iran, which is Isfahan...\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External Link ==\nDocumentary on the First World War in Iran, produced by Saber Sadeghi, YouTube",

        "content": "From January 2020, to the end of 2022, Falcon 9 was launched 117 times, all successful, and landed boosters successfully on 111 of those flights. Falcon Heavy was launched once and was successful, including landing of the mission's two side boosters.\n\n\n== Statistics ==\n\n\n== Launches ==\n\n\n=== 2020 ===\nIn late 2019, Gwynne Shotwell stated that SpaceX hoped for as many as 24 launches for Starlink satellites in 2020, in addition to 14 or 15 non-Starlink launches. At 26 launches, 14 of which were for Starlink satellites, Falcon 9 had its most prolific year, and Falcon rockets were second most prolific rocket family of 2020, only behind China's Long March rocket family.\n\n\n=== 2021 ===\nIn October 2020, Elon Musk indicated he wanted to be able to increase launches to 48 in 2021. Regulatory documents filed in February 2020, specified a maximum of 60 launches per year from Florida for Falcon 9 and another ten for Falcon Heavy, according to its 2020, environmental assessment. 31 launches actually occurred in 2021; all were successful.\n\n\n=== 2022 ===\nThere were 61 Falcon launches in 2022: one Falcon Heavy and 60 Falcon 9. Older environmental regulatory documents had showed that, in addition to launches from Vandenberg, SpaceX mentioned planning for up to 70 launches each year from its two Florida launch sites when it filed an environmental assessment in February 2020. In January 2022, information became public that SpaceX had intended to increase the pace of launches to 52 during 2022, after launching a record 31 times in 2021. In March 2022, Elon Musk stated that SpaceX was aiming for 60 Falcon launches in 2022. In the event, SpaceX did increase their launch cadence, exceeding the previous yearly record of 31 launches in just the first 29 weeks of 2022. 13 of the Falcon 9 launches were from Vandenberg. SpaceX launched over 633 tonnes this year or 1.15 times the mass of a Falcon 9 rocket just before takeoff (exclusive of undisclosed payload masses).\n\n\n== Notable launches ==\n\n\n=== First crewed flights ===\n\nSpaceX held a successful launch of the first commercial orbital human space flight on 30 May 2020, crewed with NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken. Both astronauts focused on conducting tests on the Crew Dragon capsule. Crew Dragon successfully returned to Earth, splashing down in the Gulf of Mexico on 2 August 2020.\n\n\n=== Reuse of the first stage ===\n\nSpaceX has developed a program to reuse the first-stage booster, setting multiple booster reflight records:\n\nB1048 was the first booster to be recovered four times on 11 November 2019, and the first to perform a fifth flight on 18 March 2020, but the booster was lost during re-entry.\nB1049 was the first booster to be recovered five times on 4 June 2020, six times on 18 August 2020, and seven times on 25 November 2020.\nB1051 became the first booster to be recovered eight times on 20 January 2021, nine times on 14 March 2021, and ten times on 9 May 2021, achieving one of SpaceX's milestone goals for reuse. It then became the first booster to be recovered eleven times on 18 December 2021, and twelve times on 19 March 2022.\nB1060 became the first booster to be recovered 13 times on 17 June 2022.\nB1058 became the first booster to be recovered 14 times on 11 September 2022, 15 times on 17 December 2022.\nB1069 launched and returned a hosted box containing two FIFA 2022 World Cup Adidas Al Rihla on 15 October 2022 for a sub-orbital flight, the first payload on a Falcon 9 booster.\nB1061 became the only booster on 30 December 2022 to launch from all SpaceX's different launch sites and on all of SpaceX's different landing zones and drone ships (except rarely used LZ-2 that is located nearby LZ-1).\nB1062 booster holds the record for fastest turnaround at 21 days. It launched on 8 April and again on 29 April 2022.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Falcon 1 launches\nList of Falcon 9 first-stage boosters\nList of SpaceX Dragon 1 missions\nList of SpaceX Dragon 2 missions\nList of Starlink and Starshield launches\nList of SpaceX Starship flight tests\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Masato Kanda (神田眞人) is a Japanese bureaucrat at the Ministry of Finance. Since 2021, he has served as Vice Minister of Finance for International Affairs (財務官, zaimukan), the country's top currency diplomat. Due to the yen being traded in the weakest range in the past three decades during his tenure, his remarks on the possibility of currency intervention often make news headlines, in which he is sometimes referred to as the country's 'FX Tsar'.\nHe was born in Nishinomiya, Hyogo, in 1965. He attended Nada Junior & Senior High School in Kobe, then went on to study law at the University of Tokyo. At the university, he learnt international politics from Yoichi Masuzoe, later Governor of Tokyo. After graduation, he started working for the Ministry of Finance. From 1989, he studied economics at St Hugh's College, Oxford, from which he graduated with an MPhil. Although most of his career has been spent at the ministry, he has also spent a few years each working for the World Bank and the OECD.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Amy Blankson (born March 11, 1980) is an American author and speaker known for her advocacy of positive psychology and digital wellness.\n\n\n== Education ==\nBlankson received a Bachelor of Arts from Harvard University and a Master of Business Administration from Yale School of Management.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAs a sophomore in high school, Blankson was selected as a delegate to the Presidents' Summit for America's Future, a conference headlined by Oprah Winfrey and all four living US Presidents, and organized by America's Promise. After attending the Summit, Blankson organized the Central Texas Youth Summit for 1,200 teens to learn about civic engagement. As a result, Blankson was named a Point of Light by two US Presidents. Soon after, she was named as one of the youngest Presidential appointees in history by President Clinton, who appointed her to serve a five-year term on the board of the Corporation for National and Community Service, which is known for overseeing Americorps.Blankson then went on to attend Harvard University, where she graduated cum laude in 2002 with a degree in Government. After college, Blankson worked as a Policy Fellow for Connecticut Voices for Children, advocating for youth in the foster care and juvenile justice systems. She then went on to attend the Yale School of Management, where she earned her MBA.\nAfter graduating, Blankson co-founded GoodThinkInc., a positive psychology consultancy,  with her brother Shawn Achor. The company consisted of researchers, speakers, and trainers who offer positive psychology-related services to improve work performance.

        "content": "Artemon (Ancient Greek: Ἀρτέμων) of Magnesia was a writer of ancient Greece known only as the author of a work on the virtues of women, the title of which is generally translated as Accounts of Deeds Done Courageously by Women (περὶ τῶν κατ' ἀρὴτν γυναιξὶ πεπραγματευμένων), but also sometimes Tales of Feminine Virtue or Stories of the Virtuous Exploits of Women.\nWe know from later authors that the 4th-century Sophist Sopater of Apamea made an abstract of this work; both the original and the abstract are lost. Our knowledge of Artemon comes almost exclusively from one reference in the Bibliotheca of Photios I of Constantinople, in which he describes Sopater's abstract. Some scholars have suggested this work is one of the sources of the (still extant) anonymous work Women Intelligent and Courageous in Warfare.\nLater scholars have used the existence of this Artemon's work, as well as that of a few others, and some comments by, for example, Plutarch in his Gaius Marius, implying that it would be cliche for him to rehash \"overdone\" stories of women's accomplishments, that such books were at least somewhat commonplace in ancient Greece. Other scholars point out that we should not assume that Artemon's and related works uniformly portrayed their subjects in a positive light based on modern assumptions about what these titles would signify, as authors of this period were fascinated by paradoxography, and books praising subjects generally assumed to be not praiseworthy were themselves not uncommon.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Schmitz, Leonhard (1870). \"Artemon (5)\".

        "content": "Haro 2 is a blue compact galaxy in the constellation Ursa Major. The galaxy lies about 120 million light years away from Earth based on redshift independent measurements, which means, given its apparent dimensions, that Haro 2 is approximately 45,000 light years across, while redshift indicates a distance of 70 million light years.\nGuillermo Haro first described H2 in a study published in 1956 listing 44 galaxies that were blue. Blue compact galaxies have been found to host large numbers of young massive stars due to a burst of star formation. The galaxy spectrum features emission from Wolf-Rayet stars. The age of the current starburst activity is calculated to be 5.8 ± 1.0 million years.\nAn outflow of ionised gas around the central HII region forming a shell could be galactic wind created by the starburst activity in the centre of the galaxy. The galaxy has been found to emit Lyman-alpha both from the central HII region and the shell. The expanding shell has also been observed in X-rays with ROSAT, indicating it forms a superbubble. Imaging of CO(2–1) indicates that the shell has entrained molecular gas. The kinematics of the shell suggest that it has an age of 5 to 6 million years.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNGC 3353 - a similar dwarf galaxy\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHaro 2 on WikiSky: DSS2, SDSS, GALEX, IRAS, Hydrogen α, X-Ray, Astrophoto, Sky Map, Articles and images",

His sister is the cellist Alisa Weilerstein.  Weilerstein learnt the violin as a youth, and played with the Boston Philharmonic Youth Orchestra.  He studied violin and conducting at the New England Conservatory of Music, from which he earned his master's degree.  His conducting mentors have included Hugh Wolff.\nAt the 2009 Malko Competition for Young Conductors in Copenhagen, Weilerstein won the First Prize and the Audience Prize, then the youngest first prize winner in the history of the competition.  He became a Dudamel conducting fellow with the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 2011.  He served as assistant conductor of the New York Philharmonic from 2012 to 2015.  Weilerstein was artistic director of the Orchestre de Chambre de Lausanne from 2015 to 2021.\nWeilerstein first guest-conducted the Aalborg Symphony Orchestra in 2011.  In October 2022, the orchestra announced the appointment of Weilerstein as its next chief conductor, effective with the 2023–2024 season, with an initial contract of 3 seasons.\nIn October 2023, the Orchestre national de Lille announced the appointment of Weilerstein as its next music director, effective September 2024.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website of Joshua Weilerstein\nIntermusica agency page on Joshua Weilerstein",

B.) Quigley retired from Woolworth's and opened the first Quigley's in 1936, near the corner of Sunset and Fairfax, just north of what is the border of West Hollywood today. At the time, there was little competition from supermarkets for the types of products that variety stores (or \"five and dimes\") sold. His slogan was \"basic merchandise at a reasonable price\" was his slogan.In 1948 Quigley's was owned and operated by R. B. Quigley, J. H. (James Harold) Quigley, and W. S. Manning.\n\n\n== Expansion ==\nStores were opened as follows:\n\nThe last store, Sherman Oaks, closed in 1990. Despite Quigley's calling itself a department store over the years, the Los Angeles Times put Quigley's squarely in the category of variety store. The newspaper reported that the staff prided itself on the slogan, \"if you can’t find it any place else, Quigley’s has it.\"Quigley's Belmont Shore and Plaza were voted in the top 100 of most missed things in Long Beach, according to a poll by columnist Tim Grobaty in the Long Beach Press-Telegram.\n\n\n== External links ==\nPhoto of Quigley's Burbank\nPhoto of Quigley's Belmont Shore, Long Beach\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "What Happened to the Heart? is the upcoming fourth studio album by Norwegian singer-songwriter and record producer Aurora, set for release on 7 June 2024 through Decca, Glassnote and Petroleum Records. Written and recorded between Norway, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States, Aurora worked with Ane Brun, Matias Tellez, Tom Rowlands, Chris Greatti, Dave Hamelin and Magnus Skylstad on its production.\nIt has been preceded by the release of three singles between November 2023 and March 2024: \"Your Blood\", \"The Conflict of the Mind\" and \"Some Type of Skin\". To promote the album, Aurora will embark on a European headlining concert tour in September and October 2024.\n\n\n== Background and conception ==\nIn April 2022, Aurora read a letter co-written by indigenous activists titled \"We Are the Earth\", which, according to magazine The Line of Best Fit, \"changed her life\". The letter called for a revolution: a collective response to global warming. They described the planet as \"the heart that pulsates within us\", a statement that led Aurora to create the album's title and concept. She began writing the album while on tour for The Gods We Can Touch, her previous album released on 21 January 2022. In January 2023, Aurora confirmed that she was back in the recording studio working on new music, which she called \"so many babies\".What Happened to the Heart? was announced via her social media accounts on 28 March 2024. She has dubbed the album as her most personal and cathartic project in her career. In a press release, she added: \"Though its precise function and anatomy were not clearly understood, the heart was believed to be the centre of the soul. Of intuition. Of emotion and intention. Until we decided these were qualifications of the mind. Emotion overpowered by logic. And with the world being so corrupted by money, power and selfishness you cannot help but ask yourself – what happened to the heart?\". Being interviewed by NME, the singer said that the title of the album is \"the most important, beautiful and sad question I've ever wondered in my life\".\n\n\n== Recording and production ==\nWhat Happened to the Heart? was recorded and produced between Norway, Germany, London, and Los Angeles. On the album, Aurora worked with her close collaborator Magnus Skylstad, along with musicians Ane Brun, Matias Tellez, Tom Rowlands of The Chemical Brothers, Chris Greatti and Dave Hamelin.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nAurora stated that the album's sound is very different from the previously released songs. On \"Some Type of Skin\", she \"hone[s] in\" on her signature alternative pop sound, as well as introduce synth-pop and elements of electropop.\n\n\n== Promotion ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nWhat Happened to the Heart? was preceded by the release of three singles. The song \"Your Blood\" was released on 8 November 2023 as the lead single from the album. It marked her first solo musical material since The Gods We Can Touch in 2022. The second single, titled \"The Conflict of the Mind\", was released on 18 January 2024 along a music video co-directed by Aurora alongside Kaveh Nabatian from The Barr Brothers. \"Some Type of Skin\" was released as the third and final single from the record on 20 March 2024. She performed it for the first time during an intimate show at London's Lafayette.\n\n\n=== Tour ===\nOn 28 March 2024, along with the album announcement, Aurora confirmed that she will embark on her sixth concert tour, titled What Happened to the Earth? Part 1 Tour, with dates in European cities including Milan, Vienna, Prague, Krakow, Warsaw, Berlin, Brussels, Amsterdam, Paris, London and Manchester. It contains a concert at the Royal Albert Hall. General sale for the tour will start on 5 April 2024; people who pre-ordered the album received an exclusive ticket pre-sale link for two days in advance.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Aims of Industry\nAims of Industry was founded in 1942 as an independent free enterprise corporate lobby group by business leaders in industry. It came into existence to combat nationalisation of key British industries such as sugar, iron and steel. It campaigned against the creation of the National Health Service in 1945. It was known as Aims for Freedom and Enterprise from 1975-78 and Aims from 1978-80.\n'The End of Freedom in Britain', 1973 press advert from Aims of Industry in The Times, 28 December 1973; p. 4; Issue 58974; col A.\nAlthough not directly involved in party politics, Aims of Industry is closely linked to the Conservative Party and the Freedom Association.\nIt makes an annual \"National Free Enterprise Award\", recipients of which have included F.A. Hayek, Margaret Thatcher and John Blundell.\nContents\n1\tAims' Objectives\n2\tPersonnel\n2.1\t1942 - Founding members\n2.2\t1950s\n2.3\t1972\n2.3.1\tCouncil\n2.4\t1974\n2.5\t2003\n2.6\tOther people\n3\tMembership and funding\n4\tCampaigns\n4.1\tTate not state\n5\tPublications, Related, Resources and References\n5.1\tAims of Industry publications\n5.1.1\t1940s\n5.1.2\t1950s\n5.1.3\t1960s\n5.1.4\t1970s\n5.1.5\t1980s\n5.1.6\tRelated\n5.1.7\tResources\n5.2\tReferences\nAims' Objectives\nAccording to the history of Aims published by the organisation in 1982 their objectives were:\nTo defend free enterprise and freedom\nTo create a public belief in free enterprise so that the government can take the right decisions and companies can achieve their objectives.\nTo oppose, and wherever possible reduce, unnecessary government intervention by state ownership, control or excessive bureaucracy.[1]\n'The moment of truth', press advert from Aims of Industry in The Daily Mirror, 2 October 1974; p. 25.\n'One out, All out!', press advert from Aims of Industry in The Daily Mirror, 26 February 1974; p. 22.\nIn its early years Aims was at the forefront of corporate campaigning against democratic decision making in Britain. When the Conservative Party split over Europe in the 1980s and 90s, some of Aims key leaders took the 'Eurosceptic' side, rendering them marginal in transnational business circles - so much so that the 'pro-european' lobby group Britain in Europe backed by Transnational business carried a profile of them:\nIn March 1998 Aims of Industry launched a Campaign against the European Single Currency. Two Council members of Aims of Industry, Sir Nigel Mobbs and Jamie Borwick (Sponsor/Patron, Bruges Group, since 1989) were National Council members of Business for Sterling.[2]\nPersonnel\n1942 - Founding members\nLord Perry of Stock Harvard, Chair of the Ford Motor Co. | S B Askew | A N Mobbs | Sir Felix Pole | J Arthur Rank | J V Rank | H G Starley | Sir George Usher | Garfield Weston[3]\n1950s\nBertie Bridges Webb Director from 1957-1970\n1972\nCouncil\nSir Ian Lyle, President of the council | Sir John Reiss, chairman of the council Col.

[5]\nMembership and funding\nIn 2004 Aims of Industry claimed 800 members, with six full-time members of staff.[2]\nPast funders are thought to have included Balfour Beatty [6] and Slough Estates [7] British American Tobacco supported Aims from 1949 until 1991.[8]\nCampaigns\nTate not state\nTate not State the successful campaign run by Aims of Industry to prevent the nationalisation of the sugar industry on behalf of Tate and Lyle\nHistory’s most famous sugar lump was ‘Mr Cube’, an animated cartoon character born in July 1949 in a climate of grey austerity, rationing and contentious nationalisation proposals. Mr Cube became sugar’s brand image, the company logo of Tate & Lyle and a symbol of political embarrassment and electoral setback for the Labour government in the February 1950 General Election.\nPeter Runge, the company’s campaign strategist, has recalled how ‘we were strongly advised to have a cartoon character who, if he caught the public’s imagination, could say the most outrageous things and get away with it, and who could act as a buffer between the public and Tate & Lyle’. Brandishing his sword of free enterprise and protected by his T&L shield, Mr Cube would ‘say sensible, cogent or outrageous things’ with appropriate grimaces and gesticulations, allowing Tates to ‘concentrate on attacking the Socialist policy in a somewhat more dignified manner’.

        "content": "Fr. Mykhailo Zubrytskyi of the Pomian coat of arms (October 22, 1856, Kindrativ, Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria (now Lviv Oblast, Ukraine), Austro-Hungarian Empire – April 8, 1919, Berehy Dolishni, West Ukrainian People's Republic (now Poland)) was a Greek-Catholic priest, Ukrainian ethnographer, folklorist, historian, public figure (including local self-government in the West Ukrainian People's Republic), publicist, and full member of the Shevchenko Scientific Society (from July 29, 1904; the only rural priest to hold such a rank).\nHe can be considered a founder of such currents in historical science that emerged in the 20th century, such as oral history and (partially) microhistory. The first scholar in the world who chose the life and customs of peasants as the subject of scientific research (thanks to his works, Mshanets, where he served for 31 years, is the most researched village in the historical-ethnographic dimension in all of Central and Eastern Europe).\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Origin ===\n\nHe was born on October 22, 1856, in the village of Kindrativ, now in the Turka hromada of Lviv oblast. His father, Ivan Zubrytsky, was a minor nobleman of the Pomian coat of arms, his mother Anastazia Nanivska also came from a minor noble family (of the Sas coat of arms).\nMore details are available in the article \"Zubrytskyi Family of the Pomian Coat of Arms.\"\nThe parents were engaged in agriculture. They got married in 1831. The father passed away on March 8, 1883.\n\n\n=== Family ===\nHis wife was Olga Borysevych (died in 1942), a rural schoolteacher and the daughter of the Greek-Catholic priest Father Ivan Borysevych, who served as a parish priest in Kryvcha near Sian and as a dean of the Porokhnytsa town-dean (passed away in 1900), and Sophia Nazarevych. Olga was the granddaughter of the Greek-Catholic priest Father Antoniy Nazarevych (died in 1893) and Julia Lishchynska, as well as the great-granddaughter of the Greek-Catholic priest Petro Nazarevych (passed away in 1834) and Maria Sozanska. She completed a teacher's seminary in Peremyshl, passed the qualifying exam, and for some time worked as a teacher.\nThey got married on September 27, 1883.\nThey had 4 children.\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\n\n==== Rural teachers and schools ====\nFrom the autumn of 1866, Mykhailo studied in Turka, then he spent two years studying in Rozbir.\n\n\n==== Drohobych Gymnasium ====\nIn the fall of 1868, he began studying in the third grade of the primary school in Drohobych. Since 1870, Mykhailo Zubrytskyi studied at the Drohobych Gymnasium. In Drohobych, he met his contemporary Ivan Franko. This laid the foundation for their friendship, which lasted throughout their lives.\nA letter from Ivan Franko to Shchasnyi Selskyi dated April 11, 1875, has been preserved, in which he writes: \"Our Ruthenian affairs at the Drogobych Gymnasium, as usual, are very weak. Apart from three poor Ukrainians, not a single student is interested in either literary or political Ruthenian affairs. You might be interested to know who these three are - so I tell you that Matkovskyi, you probably know from the eighth grade, Zubrytskyi from the fifth, and the third is writing to you. Certainly, it is not a good testament to our Ukrainians, but what can be done?\"\nEvidently, not without Franko's influence, while studying at the gymnasium, he paid attention to a manuscript collection from the 18th century, which he encountered in a bourgeois house. Ivan Franko mentions this fact when publishing materials from this collection in his article \"Contributions to the History of Ruthenian Literature of the 18th Century\" (1886). During this time, he collected songs, carols, and folklore in his native Kindrativ and other neighboring villages (Yasinka, Rozbir), the recordings of which he passed on to Omelyan Partatskyi, Omelyan Ohonovskyi, and other Galician scholars of that time.\nAs recalled by Father Mykhailo in his autobiography, his father supported him only during his studies in the first and second grades (presumably, at the gymnasium). After that, he had to fend for himself. During his 9 years in Drohobych, he had to change residences 15 times. He lived very poorly, often near starvation. There were times when an old stepmother, Alexandra Durnota, a lumberjack who came to Drohobych from Opaka, and with whom Mykhailo Zubrytsky rented accommodation with breaks for three years, shared beggar's bread with him, which was donated to her near the St. Trinity Church.\n\n\n==== Service in the army ====\nIn 1877, he was forcibly removed from his studies at the gymnasium and conscripted into the Austrian army, despite his shortsightedness and \"another flaw.\"\nHe served in Sambir in the 16th company (military platoon). He spoke very negatively about the pointlessness of military service, semi-starvation existence, and the lack of basic conditions.\nAfter the death of his brother Yakub in the winter of 1877, he became the sole provider for his elderly parents, which should have exempted him from military duty immediately. However, officials deliberately delayed the process for almost a year and only released him with the condition that he would not continue his studies at the Drogobych gymnasium but would work with his parents on the land.\n\n\n==== Resuming studies at the Drogobych gymnasium ====\nIndependently studied the curriculum of the 7th grade from books and in the autumn of 1878 passed the entrance exam and entered the 8th grade of the Drogobych gymnasium.\nOn July 13, 1879, he passed the \"maturity exam\" with almost the highest marks (almost with a gold medal by modern standards).\n\n\n==== Seminary ====\nHe intended to study at the Faculty of Philosophy of Lviv University. However, he decided to enroll in the Theological Faculty of Lviv University.\nHe studied at the Lviv (1879–1883) and Peremyshl theological seminaries. There, he became interested in scientific activities and wrote his first research on serfdom in the 13th century. He later married Olha Borysevych, the granddaughter of a priest from the village of Mshanets near Staryi Sambir, and eventually became a priest in Mshanets. From then on, he spent almost his entire life in Mshanets, which did not hinder but rather helped him become a unique historian of local life.\nBefore coming to the village of Mshanets in 1883, he taught for a year at the Diak Institute in Peremyshl.\n\n\n=== Activity in the village of Mshanets (1883–1914) ===\nOn November 17, 1883, Father Zubrytskyi became the parish priest in the village of Mshanets (now in the Sambir raion of Lviv Oblast), where he served for 31 years until April 25, 1914.\nFather Mykhailo Zubrytsky's activities were aimed against the assimilationist policies of foreign authorities towards Ruthenians.\n\n\n==== Enlightenment and educational activities (the \"Reader's Revolution\") ====\n\nFather Zubrytskyi was particularly active in promoting enlightenment among the local population. Thanks to him, a \"reader's revolution\" took place in the village: the priest taught the peasants to read and instilled in them an interest in reading. This led to the fact that no other village in Galicia produced as much secular intelligentsia as Mshanets.\n\nWith his direct involvement, reading rooms of \"Prosvita\" were founded and operated in Mshanets (February 28, 1892), Hrozova (April 2, 1893), Mykhnovets (April 11, 1893), Lavriv (1894), Limna (July 26, 1901), Holovetsko (1902), and Lypia (1902).\nHe was heavily involved in educational affairs, striving constantly to improve the level of knowledge and particularly the study of the Ukrainian language. He vehemently protested against the celebration of Polish national and religious holidays, the low professional training of teachers, and the assimilationist behavior of the conquerors. He demanded an increase in state funding for schools.\nHe criticized the \"stuffing\" of Ukrainian children's heads with useless Polish \"stories about Krakus, Wanda, Kazimierz, and Esterne, about Barbara Radziwiłł, etc.\" He called for the school curriculum to broaden the peasants' view of nature, to instill in them a sense of dignity, to not bow down to the \"higher\" classes, and for schools to teach young people to seek a way of life through independent work.\n\nHe promoted the children's magazine \"Dzvinok\" among parents and educators, pointing out that it was better to subscribe children to this magazine than to buy them various toys and other trifles. He reported on the publication of works on the history of Ukraine for mass reading. He even considered the choice of names for children not a trivial matter, but an integral part of a conscious attitude towards Ukrainian traditionalism and patriotism.\nHe meticulously investigated the status of the Ukrainian clergy in the past and analyzed the current situation. Through various means, he endeavored to instill in his fellow priests a sense of duty and a proper understanding of the need for their everyday work with people, education, especially in children of school age, fostering not only awareness of national unity but also personal responsibility for the fate of all Ukrainians. He left behind many significant scholarly and journalistic works that attest to Father Zubrytsky's substantial contribution to transforming the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church into a powerful bastion of the Nation and a fighter for the restoration of its conciliarity and independence.\nFor nerly 10 years (1896–1905), the Tsounty Shul Tsuncil intentionally did not send a teacher to Mshanets \"out of spite towards the Priest.\"\n\n\n==== Pastoral activities ====\n\nIn 1901, he wrote about himself: \"I am a priest and fulfill my duties from inner conviction.\"\nWhen he arrived in the village, he encountered the situation where among the parishioners \"Christian concepts were mixed with pagan ones, and ... the latter prevailed.\"\nWhen he came to the parish, only the deacon used to sing in the church, while everyone else remained silent. By 1896, during church services, everyone was already singing. \n\nHe began catechesis, read daily prayers aloud in the church, taught catechism and the Bible. After Vespers, young people would come for plebaniya, where they sang church hymns and gradually learned to read using movable type. In order for the youth to better understand the Bible, he purchased \"Biblical History in 40 Pictures\" from Freiburg, Switzerland, and after telling a certain story, he would explain it again using the pictures.\nSince religious education was neglected due to the anti-Ukrainian position of the District School Board, Father Mykhailo gathered school-aged children every Sunday evening during the fall and winter for a one-and-a-half-hour religious lecture.\nOleg Pavlyshyn uncovered much information about the visible results of Father Zubrytsky's pastoral work by analyzing the report of the dean's visitation by Father Volodymyr Levytskyi on October 20, 1904. The protocol indicates that regular services, Sunday sermons, catechism classes, and visits to the seriously ill by the priest were common. By the way, the priest regularly visited his parishioners before the Feast of Epiphany and Easter (\"Resurrection\").\n\"A number of questions concern the behavior of parishioners: whether they made their Easter confession, refrained from work on Sundays and holidays, and participated in night watches near the church. The protocol states that sobriety among the villagers is at a high level...\"\n\"...it is noted that all metric books and parish records are kept locked in a cabinet. There is also a list of all the records. The visitor remarked that the metric books are well-maintained, with entries made in the presence of witnesses. There is an active parish library.\"\nAssessing the state of the parish buildings in Mshanets, the visitor noted that the priest's residence (plebaniya), where the priest lived with his family, is in need of repairs. Conversely, the utility buildings are in good condition. The dean also acknowledged the priest's efforts to begin construction of a new church, the good condition of the church accessories, and the high level of youth knowledge in \"catechetical science.\"\n\nThe visitation protocol concludes with informal remarks from the dean: \"The honorable Father Mykhailo Zubrytsky faithfully fulfills his pastoral duties.\"\n\n\n==== Protection of Ukrainian (Ruthenian) language ====\nHe defended the rights of the Ukrainian language in education, socio-political, and cultural life. Until the end of his life, he consistently opposed cases of neglect of the Ukrainian language by chauvinistic officials in government institutions, postal workers, and others.\nHe actively opposed the Polonization of place names.\nHe advocated for the official status of the Ukrainian language as early as the late 19th century, advocating for its introduction into all aspects of public life. He reached out to highly educated professionals, trying to persuade them to expedite the development of a perfect orthography. He expressed his desire to see it built on a phonetic principle.\n\n\n==== Human rights and publicist activities ====\nFr. Mykhailo Zubrytsky consistently defended the dignity of his parishioners. He saw the results of the Austrian occupation regime better than many politicians and officials, and he knew perfectly well numerous ways and forms of covert and overt violations of those not particularly broad rights promised in the legislation of the imperial government.\nFather systematically spoke out in the press and at various gatherings criticizing government policies at the center and their implementation in the regions. More than half of his printed legacy is dedicated to exposing the real state in which the Carpathian Ukrainians found themselves. He often highlighted the living conditions of Ukrainians in other regions, which were sometimes even worse.\nHe was outraged by the practice of privileged treatment of certain peoples in the Habsburg Empire, the exploitation of Galician peasantry by industrially developed parts of Austria, restrictions on the national consciousness work of Ukrainians, discrimination against native teachers, predatory deforestation, the impunity of landlords and officials, tax manipulations, misrepresentation of the national composition of the population and its representation in county councils, police surveillance of the intelligentsia, illegal extortion, harsh conscription, the existence of forced begging, and so on.\n\n\n==== Economic development ====\nIn his numerous journalistic works, he often addressed the issues of economic and political discrimination against Ruthenians. He consistently persuaded the intelligentsia that they should work with the people, bringing them \"the light of truth and knowledge in their native Ruthenians attire.\"\nHe supported the Galician organization \"Rural Farmer,\" founded in 1899, and defended its members against various attacks and discrimination. He promoted the cooperative movement, especially the establishment of rural cooperative stores, which significantly reduced the economic exploitation of peasants by innkeepers, speculators, and usurers.\nOn April 4, 1892, he founded the \"Spilkova Kramnytsya\" (Ruthenian Store) in Mshanets, affiliated with the \"Prosvita\" reading room, initially owned by 10 local peasants, later by 16. In such stores, farmers could purchase essential goods at fair prices. He dedicated a series of press releases to this issue.\nHe understood the serfdom imposed by the invaders and forcibly imposed on Ukrainian peasants as one of the forms of colonial oppression.\n\n\n==== Scientific activity ====\nThe multifaceted complex of issues was covered by his historical and archaeological works \"The Village of Kyndrativ (Turka povit)\" and \"The Village of Mshanets in the Starosambir povit.\" In fact, they are a kind of collection of documentary sources about these Boyko villages. He often incorporated such materials into his newspaper correspondences related to current affairs.\nA certain culmination of Father Mykhailo's national and state views is his journalistic work \"It is not the time for Moscovites and Poles to serve\" (\"Svoboda\", 1912). He not only borrowed the title from Ivan Franko but also showed complete agreement with his political ideas expressed in the poetic works \"It is not the time\" and \"The Serf\". In an outspoken and sharp journalistic form, he depicts what happened during the rule of Poland and Russia in Ukraine (specifically asserting that during the founding of St. Petersburg, 20,000 Ukrainian Cossacks perished).\nThe material about Poland's annexation of Galicia and other regions of Ukraine was so truthful and sharp that the censorship confiscated it and did not allow its publication.\nThe establishment of Austrian rule in Galicia, its policy towards the indigenous population, the utilization of the Polish social elite, and other chauvinistic groups to maintain and strengthen the dominance of the conquerors are interpreted entirely from the standpoint of Ukrainian national interests.\nHis political and journalistic interventions in the press comprehensively portray the true picture of life and the struggle of the occupied Ukrainian people.\nA unique monument dedicated to the formation and initial steps of the government structures of the West Ukrainian People's Republic (ZUNR) in Lisko, Przemyśl, Ustrzyki, and their surroundings, is his chronicle of events covering a short period from November 6 to December 21, 1918.\nIvan Franko called Father Mykhailo Zubrytskyi a \"distinguished Ukrainian historian and ethnographer,\" \"a good connoisseur of the Western mountainous Boykivshchyna,\" and \"a distinguished researcher of peasant life,\" always speaking of his works with praise, appreciating them for their rich factual basis, documentary accuracy, and research integrity. Dr. Franko utilized ethnographic and folkloric materials collected by Father M. Zubrytskyi in his scholarly and literary works, always acknowledging them in the prefaces, footnotes, or references of his works.\nHe also maintained good relations with the ethnographer and literary scholar Volodymyr Hnatiuk.\nOn July 20, 1904, he became a full member of the Shevchenko Scientific Society.\nIn the spring of 1913, Mykhailo Zubrytskyi purchased 78 items in the Boyko region, including tools for processing flax, hemp, and weaving fabric, and donated them to the Museum of the Shevchenko Scientific Society in Lviv (\"Chronicle of the Shevchenko Scientific Society\" part 55).\nThe Bookstore of the Shevchenko Scientific Society in Lviv advertised books available in its inventory in the pages of the Notes of the Shevchenko Scientific Society. In 1912, they were selling 5 books by Father Zubrytskyi:\n\nThe village of Mshanets, in the Starosambir povit, costs 3 crowns;\nA large family in Mshanets, Starosambir povit - 0.10 crowns;\nTobacco smuggling in the mountains of Galicia in the 19th century - 0.60 crowns;\nContributions to the history of conscription in Galicia - 0.20 crowns;\nYears of famine. Contributions to the history of Galicia 1846-1861 - 0.20 crowns.\n\n\n==== Political activity ====\nHe skillfully used examples of national liberation movements in other countries for political awareness among his fellow countrymen, both near and far. He effectively ridiculed the absurdity of the \"evidence\" presented by Polish annexationists regarding their \"right\" to rule over Ukrainian lands.\nHe actively participated in political processes in the Boyko regions, utilizing various opportunities of his time to engage intellectuals and peasants in organized political struggle. He repeatedly ran for elections, standing as a candidate for local county councils and the Galician Sejm. He left behind many (mostly anonymous) journalistic works about the course of the electoral process.\nThroughout his life, he resolutely, consistently, and tirelessly fought against Moscophilia, demonstrating the absurdity of their political postulates and actions: \"The development of the Ruthenian people, its uplift, will not come from the north or the west, but will be accomplished by the efforts of the Ruthenians themselves.\"\nHe closely observed the work of the Ukrainian Radical Party, but its orientation towards Marxism was unacceptable to him. He strongly condemned the apostasy of Moscophils. He considered himself and his like-minded individuals as ukrainophile with full confidence, and in March 1901 openly declared that he and his associates were nationalists.\nHe spared no effort to promote the popular assembly movement in Western Boykivshchyna, despite the resistance from the pro-Austrian and Polish bureaucracy, which either refused permits for assemblies or sought the slightest pretext to prohibit them.\n\n\n==== Anti-alcohol campaign ====\nHe fought against drunkenness by all means, exposing the harmfulness of drinking and alcoholism, and popularizing organized resistance against the owners of the monopoly right to produce and sell alcoholic beverages (\"propinators\").\nFather Zubrytsky's first act surprisingly was to ban the church Nativity scene (vertep), after rewriting all the carols. The reason was the drunkenness of the participants. His second step was to prohibit inviting 15-20 godparents to baptisms, allowing only two to four. The next move was to forbid treating the midwives with horilka, etc.\nIn addition to prohibitions, the priest actively worked to create alternatives for the people. He opened the first \"Prosvata\" (educational and cultural center) in Mshanets in 1892, as detailed in the sections \"Educational Activities\" and \"Pastoral Activities\".\nIn 1894, Zubrytsky noted that people had stopped selling their fields (on the contrary, those who had the means tried to buy more), ceased going caroling and visiting each other as before, limited the number of godparents to only 2-4 (previously, they would bring up to twenty and, apparently, everyone was treated to horilka), and during meals, weddings, and funerals, only half as much vodka was consumed as before.\n\n\n==== Anti-usury campaign ====\nHe resisted the spread of usury in the villages.\nThe most effective measure was the establishment of a \"for cash\" store at the reading room of the \"Prosvita\" society. Unlike the Jews, who traded illegally and did not pay taxes, all the goods in the store were licensed (then called \"obtaining traffic\" for the sale of certain types of goods). This was very difficult due to bureaucratic obstacles.\n\n\n=== Arrest and exile (1914–1916) ===\nArrested on September 7, 1914, by the Austrian police on charges of Moscophil views, he served his exile in Thalerhof and Slovenia (1914–1916).\n\n\n=== Activity in the village of Berehy Dolishni (1916–1919) ===\n\nFrom 1916, he worked in the village of Berehy Dolishni, where he witnessed events related to the formation of the ZUNR (West Ukrainian People's Republic) in November 1918. He was arrested for the second time by the Polish police on November 25, 1918, and fell ill.\nIt is reliably known that the priest Mykhailo Zubrytskyi, who took over the parish of Berehy Dolishni in 1914 (with the daughter church of the village of Lodyny), organized assistance to Ukrainian military units with a significant number of his parishioners. He also warmly welcomed the formation of the ZUNR and sincerely congratulated the union of the ZUNR and the UNR (Ukrainian National Republic), actively engaging in the work to strengthen the young Ukrainian state.\n\nFor this, the Polish police tortured him in 1919. He passed away on April 8, 1919, in Berehy Dolishni, and was buried in the local cemetery near the church  (now a Polish Rome-Catholic church).\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThroughout his life, Father Mykhailo Zubrytskyi studied the history and folklore of his region. His creative legacy comprises over 360 works, in which the scholar explores the life and customs of the peasants of the Boyko region in the 18th and 19th centuries. Among them are 220 newspaper articles, which today serve as invaluable sources for historians.\nHe was interested in everything - the economic affairs of the inhabitants of surrounding villages, the complex social structure that varied from village to village, and land ownership. Father Zubrytskyi collected 220 documents, the oldest of which date back to the 17th century.\nHe also wrote about current events, such as the cholera epidemic or the spread of tobacco. He greatly appreciated the oral and material culture of the peasants: he collected folk songs and left wonderful drawings of buildings and clothing.\nHe also delved into the history of the clergy and collected apocrypha from the 17th and 18th centuries.\nFather Zubrytskyi was a member of the NTSh and engaged in a creative debate with Frank regarding the goals and direction of the Society's work.\nThanks to him, an ethnographic expedition of the NTSh was organized to Mshanets, where numerous materials were recorded, and around 400 photographs were taken.\n\nFather Zubrytskyi also made significant efforts to preserve and showcase world-renowned masterpieces of folk art. For example, exhibits from Mshanets are present in museums in Basel and Vienna, while the Lviv National Museum houses the painting \"The Last Judgment\" from the Mshanets church, dating back to the late 15th to early 16th centuries.\nM. Zubrytskyi also collected Ukrainian folk songs, stories, legends, proverbs, and sayings.\nHe authored research works on ethnography, folklore, and history:\n\n\"Narodnyi kalendar\" (Popular Calendar) (1900).\n\"Village of Mshanets, Starosambirskyi povit. Materialy do istorii halytskoho sela. Vstupna rozvidka i akty\" // Zapysky NTSh, Tom 70. 1906. — P. 114–167.\n\"Village of Mshanets, Starosambirskyi povit\" (second part) // Zapysky NTSh, Tom 74. 1906. — P. 93–128.\n\"About the Weddings of Our Emigrants in America\" (1913).\n\"Big Family in Mshanets, Starosambir Povit.\" // Zapysky NTSh, Tom 73. 1906. — P. 119–124.\n\"Materials on the Cultural History of Galician Rus in the 18th and 19th Centuries, Collected by Mykhailo Zubrytskyi, Yuriy Kmit, Ivan Kobyletskyy, Ivan E. Levytskyi, and Ivan Franko\" (Lviv, 1902).\nAn active defender of the national and cultural rights of Ukrainians in Transcarpathian Ukraine, he published articles in \"Dilo,\" \"Bat'kivshchyna,\" \"Zoria,\" and \"Zapysky Naukovoho Tovarystva imeni Shevchenka\" (\"Proceedings of the Shevchenko Scientific Society\").\nThe over thirty-year work of the priest and scholar in Mshanets had a significant impact on the elevation of the national consciousness of the village residents. The parishioners who were brought up by Mykhailo Zubrytskyi, their children, and grandchildren, almost the entire village, shared the ideas of the Ukrainian Military Organization and Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists in the 1920s and 1930s. Here, one of the most influential centers of the Stepan Bandera Organization operated in the 1940s and 1950s. When the Ukrainian Insurgent Army emerged, Mshanets sent its finest individuals to join its ranks. No fewer than 60 of them perished in the struggle against Polish, German, and Russian occupiers in the 1940s to 1960s.\n\n\n== Research works about Father Mykhailo Zubrytskyi ==\nNataliia Klyashtorna.

Zubrytskyi ==\nFounder of \"oral history\" and (partially) \"microhistory\" as trends in historical science.\nHe was the first in the world to choose the life and household of Boyko villagers as the subject of scientific interest.\nThanks to his work, Mshanets became the most researched village in all of Central-Eastern Europe.\nHe was the first to investigate when the toponym \"Ukraine\" was first written - in 1187 in the Kyivan Chronicle.\nHe founded the cooperative \"Ruska Kramnytsia\" (Ruthenian Store) in 1892.\nBy 1897, he could boast that in Mshanets, political assemblies gathered 500 participants (Ukrainian peasants, priests, officials) from nearby villages.\nThanks to him, the community of Mshanets was the first in the Starosambir Povit to adopt Ukrainian as the language of communication with the county authorities.\nHe was the only rural priest who was a full member of the Shevchenko Scientific Society.\nHe advocated for the legalization of firearms for peasants at the end of the 19th century, specifically for granting them the right to shoot wild animals that were causing damage to their fields and gardens.\nIn 2021, in the village of Mshanets, a festival called \"Visiting the Boykos and Father Mykhailo Zubrytskyi\" was held in his memory. It began with an Archieratical Divine Liturgy in the local church and the consecration of the cornerstone for the future monument to Father Mykhailo.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Chicken Lake, also known as Barrier Lake, is a large, irregularly shaped lake in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The lake is within the Nelson–Churchill River basin, which is the third largest in North America. Chicken Lake's primary inflow is from a channel at its southern end connecting it to Kipahigan Lake. At the northern end, the lake is connected to Sisipuk Lake through the Swan River channel. Sisipuk Lake is a lake along the course of the Churchill River. Chicken Lake Dam is situated along Swan River connecting Chicken Lake to Sisipuk Lake. The Swan River, while only about 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) long, has a drainage basin of about 1,800 km2 (690 sq mi).\nKipahigan Sakahikan 222 Indian reserve is at the southern end of Chicken Lake. The reserve is also along the northern shores of Kipahigan Lake.\n\n\n== Chicken Lake Dam ==\nChicken Lake Dam (55.6011°N 102.0189°W﻿ / 55.6011; -102.0189) was built in 1929 at Spruce Falls along the Swan River in the channel connecting Chicken Lake to Churchill River. It is 2.4 metres (7 ft 10 in) high. The dam is owned and operated by the Saskatchewan Water Security Agency. In 1929, along with the dam, a hydroelectric power station was constructed on site. The power station was built to supply electricity for the construction of Island Falls hydroelectric power station 23 kilometres (14 mi) upstream along the Churchill River. Initial construction began in 1928 and the power station was in operation from 20 March 1929 until 5 June 1930 when No. 1 Unit at Island Falls took up the load. The Spruce Falls power plant was disassembled and the generating units were transported to Island Falls.\n\n\n== Fish species ==\nFish commonly found in Chicken Lake include burbot, cisco, lake whitefish, northern pike, sauger, and walleye.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of lakes of Saskatchewan\nList of dams and reservoirs in Canada\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024 season will be United City's 3rd season in both the Philippines Football League and Copa Paulino Alcantara, and 7th overall as a club. The club would make a return to the Philippines after abstaining from the 2023 Copa Paulino Alcantara.\nThe club were previously competing in the 2022–23 season of the PFL, but suddenly withdrew from the league having been in third place due to financial issues with the one of the club's investors, Riau Capital Live. The club subsequently abstained from participating in the 2023 Copa Paulino Alcantara. In late 2023, however, the club announced their return to the league benchmarked by a new managerial staff, including chairman Esti Lestari and manager Maya Montecillo. Joan Esteva, who left after the club's withdrawal, was replaced by Romanian manager Marian Mihail. Several players who were part of the club before withdrawal such as Ivan Ouano, Ricardo Sendra, Curt Dizon, and Mark Hartmann rejoined, as well as a string of foreigners like John Kamara, Ariel Ngueukam, and PFL veteran Serge Kaole. The club also promoted two players from its Central Luzon-based academy.\n\n\n== Squad ==\nAs of 28 March 2024\n\n\n== Transfers ==\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

        "content": "Abu al-Huda al-Sayyadi (Arabic: أبو الهدى الصيادي), full name Muhammad bin Hassan Wadi bin Ali bin Khuzam al-Sayyadi, was a Syrian Islamic scholar and poet, who held the title Sheikh al-Islam of the Ottoman Empire in the 20th century. He is the father of Hasan Abu Al-Huda, the fourth Prime Minister of Transjordan (r. 1923–1931).\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSayyadi was born in 1849 in Khan Shaykhun, now modern day Syria. His lineage goes back to both Ahmad al-Rifa'i and even further back to Muhammad, hence making him a Sayyid. Due to his ancestry, he was put in charge of the Naqib al-Ashraf Association, which consisted of other Sayyids.\nSayyadi met with prominent reformists like Jamal al-Din al-Afghani. In 1895, he established a library next to the Eyüp Sultan Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey.\nThe Ottoman Sultan of the time, Abdul Hamid II, met Sayyadi and made him Sheikh al-Islam of the Ottoman Empire. After Abdul Hamid II was deposed, Sayyadi was exiled to Büyükada where he died in 1909. He is buried next to his father in Aleppo.\n\n\n== Views ==\nSayyadi was a supporter of Sufism. He was part of the Rifa'i tariqa, and wrote poems and books with Sufi themes. Sayyadi was also very anti-Salafi in his views. He encouraged the Ottoman Empire to issue a crackdown on Wahhabism. This resulted in Mahmud Shukri al-Alusi, a Sufi scholar with Salafist-influenced beliefs to be sent into exile.\n\n\n== Works ==\nKhizanat al-Amdad fi Akhbar al-Ghawth al-Kabir al-Sajad Mawlana al-Sayyid 'Izz al-Din 'Ahmad al-Sayaad\nBuni al-Islam 'iya la Khamsat Ma'badi\n\n\n== See also ==\nMahmud Shukri al-Alusi\nJamal al-Din al-Afghani\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024 Lipetsk Oblast gubernatorial election will take place on 8 September 2024, on common election day. Incumbent Governor Igor Artamonov is running to a second term in office.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThen-Sberbank vice president Igor Artamonov was appointed acting Governor of Lipetsk Oblast in October 2018, replacing five-term Governor Oleg Korolyov, who resigned at his own request. Korolyov led Lipetsk Oblast since 1998 and at the time of his resignation was the third-longest serving governor in Russia (behind Yevgeny Savchenko in Belgorod Oblast and Anatoly Artamonov in Kaluga Oblast). In November 2018 Artamonov appointed his predecessor, Oleg Korolyov, to the Federation Council after incumbent Senator Iraida Tikhonova stepped down, however, Senator Yury Volkov, a Rules committee member, questioned the constitutionality of such appointment.\nArtamonov, officially an Independent, was nominated for a full term by United Russia in the 2019 gubernatorial elections. Igor Artamonov won the September 2019 election with 67.28% of the vote, as his nearest challenger, Sergey Tokarev (CPRF), received 20.03%, although Artamonov's more notable challengers, Lipetsk Oblast Council of Deputies member Oleg Khomutinnikov (PARNAS) and State Duma member Aleksandr Sherin (LDPR), failed to qualify. In March 2020 Governor Artamonov officially joined United Russia party.\n\n\n== Candidates ==\nIn Lipetsk Oblast candidates for Governor can be nominated only by registered political parties. Candidate for Governor of Lipetsk Oblast should be a Russian citizen and at least 30 years old. Candidates for Governor should not have a foreign citizenship or residence permit. Each candidate in order to be registered is required to collect at least 6% of signatures of members and heads of municipalities. Also gubernatorial candidates present 3 candidacies to the Federation Council and election winner later appoints one of the presented candidates.\n\n\n=== Declared ===\nIgor Artamonov (United Russia), incumbent Governor of Lipetsk Oblast (2018–present)\n\n\n== See also ==\n2024 Russian regional elections\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Miroslav Jureňa (born 17 June 1954) is a Slovak politician. From 2006 to 2007 he served as the Minister of Agriculture of Slovakia. \n\n\n== Biography ==\nJureňa was born on 17 June 1954 in Skalica in a farming family.  He grew up in Gbely, playing in the local football team. In 1977 he graduated from the Slovak University of Agriculture. Following his graduation until 1990 he was the head of agricultural cooperative in Gbely as well as a member of the town council. Until the Velvet Revolution, he was a member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. After the privatization of the agricultural cooperatives in Slovakia, Jureňa became an agricultural manager in the private sector.\n\n\n=== Political career ===\nFollowing the independence of Slovakia, Jureňa became active in the Peasants' Party of Slovakia, a junior ally of the ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS). In 1998 the Peasants' Party merged into the HZDS. Jureňa's position within the party strengthened in 2005, when Miroslav Maxon, the chief agriculture expert of the party, left over disagreements with the party leadership. Maxon's departure allowed Jureňa to take his place and became the party's leading agriculture expert and, following the 2006 Slovak parliamentary election, the Minister of Agriculture.\nIn November 2007, Jureňa was asked by the Prime Minister Robert Fico to resign over corruption allegations. Jureňa organized his final press conference in a cowshed in Vajnory. He justified the choice of venue by the example of Jesus Christ, who was famously born in the manger. Building up on the Biblical theme, he compared Fico to the Pharisee from the Gospel of Luke.  The press conference primarily focused on Jureňa listing corruption allegations against other cabinet members and questioning why they weren't punished when he was. \nFollowing his dismissal from the government, Jureňa served as a Deputy of the National Council of Slovakia until 2010. Following the failure of HZDS to reach the representation threshold in the 2010 Slovak parliamentary election, Jureňa left HZDS and joined the Slovak National Party (SNS).\nIn 2024, Jureňa became the head of campaign of Štefan Harabin for the 2004 Slovak presidential election. Following the elimination of Harabin in the first round, Jureňa issued a press release supporting Peter Pellegrini in the runoff. Immediately after the information became public, Harabin denied supporting Pellegrini. According to Harabin, Jureňa acted on his own and was fired as a result of issuing an incorrect statement.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nJureňa is married with one daughter.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Pediatric environmental health is a specialty area of pediatrics that focuses on the influence of environmental exposures on health, development, and disease among children. The specialty focuses on exposures in early life, with particular emphasis on prenatal exposures. The \"environment\" is defined broadly and considers chemical, biological, nutritional, and social factors. Specialists in pediatric environmental health explore associations between environmental exposures and diseases in childhood, but also study the influence of early environmental exposures on disease incidence in adult life. Pediatric environmental health is based on the recognition that children are not “little adults.” Infants and children have unique patterns of exposure and vulnerabilities. Environmental risks of infants and children are qualitatively and quantitatively different from those of adults.\nPediatric environmental health is highly interdisciplinary. It spans and brings together general pediatrics and numerous pediatric subspecialties as well as epidemiology, occupational and environmental medicine, medical toxicology, industrial hygiene, and exposure science.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "This article is about participants in Holy Week processions in Spain. For the various religious cults see Nazarene (sect)\n\nA nazareno (nazarene) is a member of a brotherhood which performs penance rites during Holy Week in Spain (and in some Latin American countries such as Colombia and Guatemala). They parade wearing the clothing that conforms to the rules of the brotherhood.  The most common term in use is Nazarenes, in but some regions  they are known as capuchones (hoodies),or mozorros  (lads) or some variation of implying “worthy of punishment”\n\n\n== Tronos ==\nTeams of several dozen lightly clad members will be hidden beneath drapery of the heavy platform (typically 1 – 5 tonnes ]) bearing an enthroned and splendid icons  that are the centrepiece of most parades (See illustration above). \nInjuries affect some 10% of  bearers. The most common injuries derived from the effort of carrying a throne at Easter are reportedly \"shoulder or ankle tendinitis, muscle tears, frozen shoulder or ligament damage\" \n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\nThe name \"Nazarene\" derives the town of Galilee, where Jesus spent most of his life, according to the Bible. Although Jesus was born in Bethlehem, Judea, and spent a brief period of childhood in Egypt, he soon settled with his father Joseph and his mother Mary in the small town of Nazareth. \nIt is important in Spanish to  differentiate the nazarene (with lowercase letters) from the Nazarene (with an initial capital). The first relates to members of Cofradías and the second is reserved for the contemporary companions of Jesus of Nazareth, especially those that helped him bear his cross during his final humiliation.\n\n\n== Clothing insignia ==\nSince the 16th century there were processions of brothers who carried insignia similar to the current  fraternity banners, scrolls and Christian religious symbols They dress in a  Thawb secured at the waist by rope belt or a simple  girdle, on their heads a pointed Capirote cap made of a leather cone covered in cotton or linen that extends to obscure the face and neck to ensure animosity. Similar garb was adapted by the Ku Klux Klan in the 19th century\n\n\n== Modernity ==\nModern participants tend to become members of Cofradías by family tradition rather than from devout religious conviction, motivated by masculine pride in being chosen, fit and capable of enduring the rigorous ordeal of a prolonged street theater performance. \nRecently (from about 2024) women have been admitted to some Cofradíason the basis that Mary, Mother of Jesus and Mary Magdalene were recorded as present at the crucifixion and were presumably loyal devotees of Christ\n\n\n== Popular culture ==\nBlasphemous received \"generally favorable\", ratings the  Metacritic web reviewer covering several gaming platforms.\n\n\n== See also ==\nConfraternity of penitents\nBlack Nazarene\n\n\n== References ==",

He is known for his contributions to Quranic studies and the interpretation of Hafez's poetry.\n\n\n== Background ==\nBahauddin Khorramshahi completed his primary and secondary education in Qazvin. Initially enrolled in the field of medicine, he later switched his focus to Persian literature, studying under several renowned writers of the time, including Ghadam-Ali Sarami. He earned a master's degree in librarianship from Tehran University (1971 to 1973) and subsequently worked at the library service center.\nHis professors in Persian literature included, Zabihollah Safa, Mehdi Mohaghegh, Jafar Shahidi, Parviz Natel-Khanlari, Seyed Sadiq Goharin (fa), Abolhasan Shearani, and Abdul Hamid Badi Al-Zamani Kurdistani (fa). His success in Quranic research is indebted to the book \"Qanun Tafsir\" and its author, Seyyed Ali Kamali Dezfouli.\nBahauddin Khorramshahi married in 1973 and has three children named Hatif, Aref, and Hafez.\n\n\n== Quranology ==\nKhorramshahi is renowned as one of the scholars and translators of the Holy Quran into Persian. His Quranic research encompasses three main areas: general books and articles, critical analysis of existing translations, and his own translation of the Quran.\nHis translation of the Quran is characterized by fluent, modern, and literary prose. Beyond translation and commentary, his work includes appendices covering various topics such as the translator's preface, articles on Quranic research, the preservation of the Quran, interpreting the Quran with the Quran, Persian vocabulary in the Quran, and a glossary.\n\n\n== References ==",

In February 2023 she was appointed as the first AI Editor of the Financial Times.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMadhumita grew up in Mumbai, India. She studied biology at the University of Oxford and worked there on AIDS vaccine research before taking an MA in science journalism at New York University.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMadhumita joined the Financial Times in 2016 and was its European technology correspondent before taking her present role. She was previously tech editor at The Telegraph and associate editor of Wired UK. In 2017 she gave a TEDx talk at Exeter, on \"How data brokers sell your identity\".\nHer book Code Dependent was shortlisted for the 2024 Women's Prize for Non-Fiction. The Guardian's reviewer described it as \"an account of how the everyday algorithms we have already learned to live beside are changing us: from the people paid (not much) to make sense of vast datasets, to the unintended consequences of the biases they contain\", and \"the story of a dystopia we are already living in\". The Reading Agency noted that \"Through the voices of ordinary people in places far removed from Silicon Valley, Code Dependent explores the impact of a set of powerful, flawed, and often exploitative technologies on individuals, communities, and our wider society\".\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nCode Dependent: Living in the shadow of AI (2024, Picador: ISBN 978-1529097306)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPassmore, Lynsey (21 March 2024). \"In conversation with Madhumita Murgia\".

        "content": "The 2024 Kursk Oblast gubernatorial election will take place on 8 September 2024, on common election day. Incumbent Governor Roman Starovoyt is eligible to run to a second term in office.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThen-Deputy Minister of Transport Roman Starovoyt was appointed acting Governor of Kursk Oblast in October 2018 replacing four-term Governor Alexander Mikhailov, who resigned at his own request. Mikhailov led Kursk Oblast since 2000 and at the time of his resignation was the third-longest serving governor in Russia (behind Yevgeny Savchenko in Belgorod Oblast and Anatoly Artamonov in Kaluga Oblast), although he assumed that title just a little over a week ago with the resignation of Oleg Korolyov in Lipetsk Oblast. In November 2018 Starovoyt appointed his predecessor, Alexander Mikhailov, to the Federation Council after incumbent Senator Vitaly Bogdanov stepped down.\nStarovoyt, officially an Independent, was nominated for a full term by United Russia in the 2019 gubernatorial elections. Roman Starovoyt overwhelmingly won the September 2019 election with 81.07% of the vote, as his nearest challenger, Vladimir Firsov (CPRF), received just 5.65%. In November 2020 Governor Starovoyt officially joined United Russia party.\n\n\n== Candidates ==\nIn Kursk Oblast candidates for Governor can be nominated only by registered political parties. Candidate for Governor of Kursk Oblast should be a Russian citizen and at least 30 years old. Candidates for Governor should not have a foreign citizenship or residence permit. Each candidate in order to be registered is required to collect at least 6% of signatures of members and heads of municipalities. Also gubernatorial candidates present 3 candidacies to the Federation Council and election winner later appoints one of the presented candidates.\n\n\n=== Publicly expressed interest ===\nRoman Starovoyt (United Russia), incumbent Governor of Kursk Oblast (2018–present)\n\n\n== See also ==\n2024 Russian regional elections\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Vostok 2022 (Russian: Восток 2022, lit. 'East 2022') was a large-scale Russian military exercise held the Russian Eastern Military District (encompassing Siberia and the country's Far East, including the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk) from September 1 to September 7, 2022.\nIt was supervised by the Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Federation general Valery Gerasimov. A total of 13 countries took part in the exercise, which, in addition to Russia, included China, India, Belarus, Armenia, Algeria, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Syria, Nicaragua, Laos, Mongolia and Tajikistan. The Chinse contingent was the second largest after the Russian one, and the most comprehensive contingent China ever sent to Russian exercises (it was the first time all three branches of Chinese  military - the infantry, navy and air force -participated in a training activity in Russia). It was composed of approximately 2,000 soldiers, 300 vehicles, 21 planes and 3 ships from the Northern Theater Command. The Indian contingent was made up of elements of 7th and 8th Gorkha Rifles, estimated to be about 75 soldiers strong.\nThe Russian minister of defence Sergei Shoigu claimed that the exercise would involve over 300,000 soldiers which would make it Russia's biggest military exercise to date, but that estimate was said to be inflated. According to the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, over 50 thousand military personnel, more than 5 thousand units of weapons and military equipment, including 140 aircraft, 60 warships, boats and support vessels were supposed to participate in the exercise. The excerise was smaller than the previous Vostok 2018.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin observed the exercise.\nChinese participation in the drills have been said to reflect improved China–Russia relations, and a message to the West that Russia still has international military allies, despite its recent invasion of Ukraine. On the other hand, the drills have been said to worsen Japan-Russia relations as they included a naval exercise near the disputed islands of South Kuril, claimed by both Russia and Japan. India chose not to send its maritime units to the Vostok-2022 as it did not wish to jeopardize its relation with Japan.\nRussian tactics displayed in the exercise have been criticized as obsolete.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Katherine O'Donnell Nelson (born 27 December 1977), known as Kate Nelson, is a retired American rhythmic gymnast. She was part of the national senior group.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nKate practiced ballet and tumbling getting her start in gymnastics at the YMCA, switching from artistic to rhythmic when she was 10–11 years old. Later she was on the US national rhythmic gymnastics team from 1994 to 1996, being part of the national senior group along Aliane Baquerot, Lori Fredreickson, Mandy James, Ginny Ledgerwood, Becky Turner, Brandi Siegel and Challen Sievers. They all lived together in suburban Chicago largely due to Sievers’ father, Ron, whose construction firm renovated the house where the gymnasts lived and converted a former racquetball complex into the gym where they trained.\nIn 1994 the group was 19th at the World Championships in Paris. They won silver at the 1995 Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, and placed second in the group at the 1995 Four Continents Championships. \nIn the summer of 1996 Kate, Mandy James, Aliane Baquerot, Becky Turner, Brandi Siegel and Challen Sievers were selected to compete at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, the first edition to feature the group competition. They finished in 9th place and so did not advance to the final.\nIn 2012 she opened the YMCA National Championships and Summer Fest in Milwaukee. Nelson married and later settled in Buffalo Grove, Illinois, with her husband and two sons Will and Tyler.\n\n\n== References ==",

On 24 November 1879 the Bulgarian Knyaz dissolved the first National Assembly and appointed a new conservative cabinet headed by Bishop Kliment of Tarnovo. The cabinet lasted until 26 March 1880 when it was dissolved after another win for the Liberal party at the elections for the 2nd National Assembly.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter the elections for the First National Assembly at the end of September 1879, the Liberal party achieved a grand victory by winning 140 out of 170 seats in the Parliament. In parliamentary debates, the Liberals accused the Conservative government of breaking the Constitution and passed a vote of no confidence in the Burmov cabinet. On the other hand, the Russian emperor insisted on forming a coalition government, in order to stabilize the political situation in the Bulgarian principality. Taking this into account Knyaz Alexander I tasked the liberal Petko Karavelov with forming a coalition cabinet. His reluctance to enter a coalition was used as a reason for the Knyaz to assign the formation of a new cabinet, consisting only of Conservative party members, despite the domination of the Liberals in the parliament.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nFor the short period of his reign, the second cabinet made up of members of the Conservative party, managed to pass a law on the organization and activities of the Bulgarian army, by which the armed forces of the Principality were approved as a standing army with a common compulsory service for men, which was in violation of the Berlin Treaty.\nIn domestic politics an issue with utmost priority remained the organization of the state apparatus.Three out of five governors in the principality were replaced. At the end of 1879, the cabinet began to meet jointly with Konstantin Stoilov, head of the administration of Knyaz Alexander I, and this soon became a practice. In foreign policy, the cabinet was focused on strengthening contacts with European countries, establishing new diplomatic ties and escaping international isolation.\nIn January 1880, new parliamentary elections were held, which were won convincingly by the Liberal Party, securing 109 out of 172 seats in the Parliament. On 24 March 1880, pressed by the liberal majority in the Second National Assembly, Knyaz Alexander I was forced, after a long visit to St. Petersburg, to dissolve the Kliment Cabinet and appoint a Council of Ministers headed by the leader of the Liberals Dragan Tsankov.\n\n\n== Cabinet ==\nThe cabinet, headed by Bishop Kliment of Tarnovo, is made up of members of the Conservative Party, who were favored by the Knyaz, and a Russian general at the head of the war ministry.\n\n\n=== Changes in cabinet ===\n\n\n==== 29 November 1879 ====\n\n\n==== 19 January 1880 ====\n\n\n==== 22 March 1880 ====\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sall Grover is an Australian businesswoman and the founder of Giggle, a social media app designed for women. The app gained notability following a legal challenge concerning the legality of the app's membership policies restricting access to women and other adults assigned female at birth, thereby including all cisgender women, and transgender men, and excluding cisgender men and transgender women. Prior to this endeavour, Grover worked in the film industry in Australia and in the United States as a production assistant and as a screenwriter.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGrover grew up on the Gold Coast, Queensland and studied journalism and philosophy at Bond University. She initially worked as a production assistant on a short 2005 film, The Vanished, and as an entertainment journalist—first in Australia, then the UK—before moving to Los Angeles to begin to work in the film industry as a screenwriter. Grover collaborated with Australian screenwriter Emma Jensen who had also moved to Los Angeles. Together they wrote a script for a romantic comedy film titled Sex on the First Date, and a novel, The LA Team, for the purpose of adapting to television. After returning to Australia, Grover founded Giggle for Girls, a social networking app for women, an endeavour that would result in a landmark legal case (see section below). In 2022, she gave birth to a daughter. Following the birth, Grover raised the issue concerning the use of gender neutral language in Medicare forms (swapping a field for \"mother's name\" to \"birthing parent\") which had been part of a trial used in three hospitals. As a result, Bill Shorten, Minister for Government Services, reversed the naming policy to its previous position.\n\n\n== Giggle app ==\nIn 2020, Grover founded Giggle for Girls, styled as a mobile app for a women's only social networking site. The name, Giggle, is described as a collective noun for women, with the app presented as catering to adult women, offering a safe online space for them to connect and find support in various areas such as finding roommates, freelancing, emotional support, and activism. Grover has said she was driven to develop a women's only digital platform by her desire to guard against the advances of predatory men, a view that was informed by her experience with misogyny and sexual violence. To verify users, the app relied on technology developed by Kairos, a company that offers facial recognition software. Her app was given generally positive reviews, particularly by gender-critical organisations, such as FiLiA, Women's Declaration International (WDI), Cambridge Radical Feminists Network and Meghan Murphy's Feminist Current.  By 2021, the app reportedly had 20,000 users from 88 countries. However, she decided to shut down the app in July of 2022. Grover has alleged that transgender activists have sent numerous rape threats and death threats in relation to the app's membership policy.\n\n\n=== Legal case ===\nGrover's efforts to create a digital women-only space that excluded transgender women led to legal proceedings to determine the legality of the membership policies used on the platform. The case has become known as Tickle v Giggle, which unfolded between 2022 and 2024:\n\nJanuary 2022: matter brought to the Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) by Roxanne Tickle, a transgender woman from Lismore, New South Wales who was denied membership of the site. AHRC initially offered conciliation between the parties but those efforts were unsuccessful.\nMay 2022: matter filed in the Federal Circuit Court following the complaint.\nJuly 2022: case was, without explanation, dropped, as Tickle sought to discontinue all of the orders.\nJune 2023: application made by Katherine Deves to dismiss the case was rejected.\nDecember 2023: case reopened by Tickle. Tickle was granted $50,000 from Grata Fund, a not-for-profit legal fund associated with University of New South Wales, to cover costs associated with the case.\nApril 2024: hearing began before Justice Robert Bromwich with Giggle and Grover represented by Bridie Nolan. The court was required to examine the application of the Australian government's 2013 amendments to the 1984 Sex Discrimination Act. The amendments, which relate to gender identity, have not been tested in court prior to this case. The court's decision will determine if the social networking app may be considered as a special measure to advance women's equality under the Sex Discrimination Act, where the exclusion of men is permitted under law.\n\n\n=== Responses ===\nThe Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) participated in the legal case by sending representatives to the court, including Anna Cody, the Sex Discrimination Commissioner. The Commission's role in the case was extended as a ‘friend of the court’ (amicus curiae) in order to clarify the provisions in Australia's Sex Discrimination Act. While the Commission sought earlier conciliation between the parties, it declined to offer submissions to the case. Reem Alsalem, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women and Girls, was asked to provide input in the form of a position paper to the Australian Human Rights Commission. Alsalem's paper discussed the definition of \"woman\" in international human rights treaties, particularly the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). Alsalem argues that while CEDAW does not explicitly define \"woman\", it refers to biological females and that sex and sex-based discrimination in that context is understood as a biological category.  The outcome of the case is viewed as one of great significance to advocates of female-only services and spaces, and for all countries around the world where CEDAW has been ratified. Women's groups supporting Grover's position in the case include LGB Alliance Australia, Women's Forum Australia (WFA), Coalition of Activist Lesbians (CoAL), and Australian Feminists for Women's Rights (AF4WR).\n\n\n== See also ==\nWoman's Commonwealth – a women's land-based commune established during first-wave feminism\nWomyn's land – a women's community established during second-wave feminism\nMcIver Women's Baths – a notable women's only space in Sydney\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hilary Kilmarnock, Lady Kilmarnock (21 July 1928 – 24 June 2010), known as Hilly, was the first wife of Kingsley Amis and the mother of Martin Amis. When her third husband, Alistair Boyd, became Chief of Clan Boyd and 7th Baron Kilmarnock, she became Lady Kilmarnock.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHilary Ann Bardwell was the youngest child of Leonard Sidney Bardwell, a Ministry of Agriculture civil servant, and Margery M. Bradley-Clark. She had three older brothers and a sister. She grew up in Kingston-upon-Thames, moving to Harwell, Oxfordshire when her father retired after WWII. She attended Bedales School and Beltane School for one year. To avoid wartime bombing she was sent to Dr Williams’ School for Young Ladies in North Wales but was expelled after running away. She returned to Bedales, from which she also ran away several times, leaving school permanently when she was 15. She was described in one school report as “unteachable”. Her sister suspected she may have been dyslexic.After leaving school she worked as a trainee kennel maid, a stable hand and assisted at wartime day nurseries. She enrolled as an art student at Ruskin College, Oxford, but “abandoned the course”, working as a ‘head model’ (one who modelled from the neck up) at the college instead.\n\n\n== Relationship with Kingsley Amis ==\nHilly and Amis met at Elliston and Cavell’s tearoom in Oxford in 1946, with Amis passing her a note to her ask if she would like to go for a drink. She replied positively a few days later. One early connection of theirs was a shared a love of jazz.When Hilly became pregnant at the end of the year, the couple tried an unsuccessful ‘DIY abortion’. After seeking an (illegal) surgical procedure, and upon the advice of several doctors about the risk to Hilly's health, they chose to keep the baby. They married at the Oxford registry office on 21 January 1948 and moved into a small flat in north Oxford the following month. In the May they moved to Eynsham, with Hilly giving birth to Philip (named after Kingsley's best friend, Philip Larkin) on 15 August 1948.\nTheir second son, Martin was born in 1949, after which the family moved in briefly with Hilly's parents.In 1950 the family moved to Swansea so that Amis could teach at the university. Money was tight and Hilly took work cleaning the local cinema. In January 1951 she received a legacy of £2,400, which meant they could buy a house in the Uplands area of Swansea. After the publication of Amis's first novel Lucky Jim in 1954, the family's fortunes improved significantly. In the same year, Hilly gave birth to their third child, a daughter, Sally, at home. As a parent, Hilly “set no rules and had a refreshing disregard for health and safety.”Hilly discovered that her husband had been serially unfaithful to her when she found a private diary and letters. These detailed a number of affairs, many of which involved women known to Hilly. Amis’ infidelities had begun before the birth of Martin, their second son. Hilly was also occasionally unfaithful, beginning when they were living in Swansea. In 1956 she “announced she was in love with the married journalist Henry Fairlie” but “Kingsley saw him off with a blistering letter.”In autumn 1958 the family moved to Princeton, New Jersey, for a year, where Amis had been invited to take up the position of Visiting Fellow in Creative Writing at the university. Amis's infidelities continued there. In 1961 the family moved to Cambridge, England, where Amis took the position of fellow in English at Peterhouse. The role did not last long and in Easter 1962 the couple travelled to Majorca and found a house near local resident Robert Graves, whose writing Amis “much admired”.It was around this time that Amis met the author Jane Howard at the Cheltenham Literary Festival, who would become his second wife. When Hilly found out about their relationship, unlike previous infidelities, “there were to be no promises of better behaviour” from Amis. Soon after this meeting, while on holiday in Yugoslavia and “overwhelmed with misery at the latest evidence of his infidelity”, she wrote “1 FAT ENGLISHMAN [the title of his current book]. I FUCK ANYTHING” on Amis's back in lipstick while he was asleep on the beach.Soon after, Amis left for a holiday with Howard, with a plan to return to the family in time to relocate to Majorca for the start of the school year. However, when he got back to Cambridge, Hilly had already left for Sóller in Majorca, taking the children with her. In response, Amis headed to Howards's flat. From this moment, “Hilly and Amis were never to live together as husband and wife.”Hilly lived with her three children in Sóller until they returned to England in 1964, moving briefly into Ovington Gardens, then Fulham Road in London. By this point Hilly was “profoundly depressed… drinking heavily”, taking amphetamines and barbiturates.\nAround this time she destroyed all the letters Amis had ever sent her.Hilly took in paying boarders and began work at Battersea Park zoo, “which she liked very much, animals being her chief enthusiasm and joy through life.” Hilly and Amis's divorce was finalised in June 1965. The following month Hilly and the children moved to Wivenhoe, Essex.\n\n\n== Marriage to Bailey ==\nIt was in Wivenhoe that she began a relationship with David Roy Shackleton Bailey, known as “Shack”, a fellow and bursar at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. They married on 21 November 1967. The following year Bailey obtained a position as professor of Latin at the University of Michigan. They moved with Sally to Ann Arbour where Hilly opened a fish and chip shop called “Lucky Jim’s”. Bailey was “parsimonious to her\" and she ran the shop to generate spending money. The relationship was ultimately unsuccessful, and Hilly began a brief affair with Milton Cohen, another academic, who retired soon after the affair began, moving to Crete without Hilly.In summer 1970 Cohen booked Hilly, Bailey and Sally a holiday apartment in Andalusia but wanted Hilly to join him in Crete. However, she wanted to stay in Spain for the entire season, while Bailey wanted to return to America. At this point Hilly made it clear “she was not going back with him, then or ever.”\n\n\n== Marriage to Boyd ==\nSally found a language school in Ronda run by Alastair “Ali” Boyd, who was to become Hilly's third husband. She helped Boyd run the school for a few months and the pair tried, unsuccessfully, to launch in Seville. While in Seville, Hilly found a job as a matron at an international school for a year, after which she and Boyd returned to Ronda. On their return, the couple ran art courses, managed a bar and took in paying guests at Casa de Mondragon, the house where Boyd had lived with his previous wife for twenty years.In 1972 Hilly returned to Swansea to give birth to their son, Jaime. The following year, Bailey finally granted her a divorce. Hilly and Boyd married in 1977 and they returned to England the same year. The family lived in Thornborough, Buckinghamshire and Boyd (his father having died in 1975) took his seat in the House of Lords. Money was tight; at one point “Hilly and a friend set up a hot-dog stand on the motorway to make a little extra.”\n\n\n== Caring for Amis ==\nIn 1980 Howard left Amis, and his long-standing phobia of being alone became a problem. Initially his sons provided company, but a long-term solution was needed. Philip suggested Hilly, Boyd and Amis create an unlikely “ménage” – “Amis had money, Hilly had the necessary household skills and… Ali did his bit around the house too.”Initially, Hilly and Boyd lived with Amis in his house on Jeffrey's Place, London.  However, they soon found the house too small for “a child, a writer, a politician and a housewife” in residence. In 1982 they moved to Kentish Town and three years later in July 1985 they moved to an even larger house on Primrose Hill. The arrangement included Amis’ paying Hilly £50 a week to keep the house. In a letter from 1993, Amis wrote “Three houses and 13 years later… it certainly seems to work.” The arrangement lasted until Amis's death in 1995.In Martin Amis's memoirs he “reminds his mother that she rescued Kingsley, bought him “back to life and love” and that Amis could never have written his last six novels, his memoirs and last poems, without her.” Zachary Leader, Kingsley’s biographer, wrote that after Howard left Amis, he “became clearer (or at least more public) about Hilly’s importance to him: leaving her, he claimed, was the single biggest mistake of his life.”\n\n\n== After Amis’s death ==\nIn 1998 Hilly and Boyd moved permanently to Ronda. Boyd died in 2009. Hilly, suffering from emphysema and having trouble walking following an accident with one of her horses, died in 2010.\n\n\n== In literature ==\nAmis dedicated his 1984 novel Stanley and the Women to Hilly. He also dedicated the poem For H to her, which appeared “instead of an epilogue” in his memoirs. Zachary Leader identified that Amis’ characters Rhiannon Weaver (The Old Devils, 1986) and Jenny Standish (Difficulties with Girls, 1988) took inspiration from Hilly. He also cites the plots of That Uncertain Feeling (1955) and Take A Girl Like You (1960) as being influenced by Amis’ marriage to Hilly.Gavin Ewart’s 1991 poem Relicts, as It Were, cites Hilly (née Bardwell) and Monica Jones (Philip Larkin's partner) as witnesses to the normal lives of poets.

        "content": "NGC 3193 is an elliptical galaxy in the constellation Leo. The galaxy lies about 90 million light years away from Earth, which means, given its apparent dimensions, that NGC 3193 is approximately 80,000 light years across. It was discovered by William Herschel on March 12, 1784.\n\nNGC 3193 lies at the north-east edge of the galaxy compact group HCG 44, which also includes the spiral galaxies NGC 3185, NGC 3187 and NGC 3190. HCG 44 is considered to be part of a larger galaxy group known as LGG 194, which also includes the galaxies NGC 3162, NGC 3177, NGC 3213, NGC 3226, NGC 3227, NGC 3287, and NGC 3301. It is a member of the Leo II Groups, part of the Virgo Supercluster. NGC 3193 has similar radial velocity with NGC 3187 and NGC 3190, however redshift independent distances put NGC 3193 at a greater distance than the rest of the group, although these measurements have large error margins.\nA long tail of hydrogen has been found north of NGC 3193 and two smaller hydrogen clouds lie southeast of the galaxy. A dwarf spheroidal galaxy has been detected in the halo of NGC 3193.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nNGC 3193 on WikiSky: DSS2, SDSS, GALEX, IRAS, Hydrogen α, X-Ray, Astrophoto, Sky Map, Articles and images",

        "content": "Inês Carmelo Rosa Calado Lopes Domingos (born 1977) is a Portuguese politician and economist. From March 2021 to March 2024, she was an economic advisor to the president of Portugal. She is a member of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and in the March 2024 national election she was elected to the Portuguese Assembly of the Republic, having previously served in the Assembly between 2015 and 2019.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nDomingos was born on 12 May 1977. She studied at the European School of Brussels, a school normally reserved for children of diplomats and EC officials, before moving to the Université Catholique de Louvain, where she completed a bachelor's degree in economics in 1999. In 2006 she obtained a master's in economics from the same university. She started to study for a PhD in international relations and political science at the Catholic University of Portugal (UCP) in 2017.\n\n\n== Career ==\nDomingos worked as an economist in the economic research departments of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs in London. From 2009 she has been a teaching assistant at the Católica Lisbon School of Business & Economics, the business school of UCP. In 2021 she began work as an economics advisor to Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, the president of Portugal. She also writes regular columns in Portuguese newspapers, notably the online Observador.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nIn the 2015 national election Domingos was elected to the National Assembly to represent the Viseu District as a member of the PSD, serving until 2019. She was not re-elected in the 2019 election nor in the 2022 election. In the 2024 election the PSD formed a coalition with two smaller parties to form the Democratic Alliance. The Alliance obtained three of the seats in the 8-seat Viseu constituency and Domingos was elected, being third on the Alliance's list. Domingos is the coordinator of the \"Entrepreneurship, Innovation and Digitalization\" committee of the PSD's National Strategy Council.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nDomingos is married to Hugo Ferreira Mendes Domingos.\n\n\n== References ==",

A correction was published online in 2021. As of April 2024, the correction was not accepted by the International Fossil Plant Names Index, as the publication of the genus name gave two type species.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "A Hipster in Rural Spain (Spanish: Un hipster en la España vacía) is a 2024 comedy film directed by Emilio Martínez Lázaro, with a screenplay by Daniel Castro based on the satirical book by Daniel Gascón. It stars Lalo Tenorio, Berta Vázquez, Macarena García, and Paco León.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nNaïve political activist Quique is sent from the city to a small village in the province of Teruel by his party leader to develop some workshops and sustainable crops as a part of a ruse so the leader could secretly spend time with Quique's girlfriend Lina. Quique initially finds little to no acceptance to his modern political agenda among the reluctant rural folks, with only tavern keeper Lourdes offering him some help.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film is a LaZona production, with Gonzalo Salazar-Simpson taking over production duties. Shooting primarily took place in Fuentespalda, province of Teruel.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe film was presented at the 27th Málaga Film Festival on 2 March 2024. It was released on Amazon Prime Video on 27 March 2024.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nCynthia Serna Box of Infobae assessed that \"everything in Martínez-Lázaro's feature film is outdated: its premise, the performances and even the love story between Tenorio and Vázquez\".\nRaquel Hernández Luján of HobbyConsolas rated the film with 45 points ('bad'), considering that the comedy film \"leaves much to be desired\", negatively mentioning the \"rather lazy\" writing, the lack of chemistry, the absence of internal tempo in the narrative, and [the] few laughs.\nIrene Crespo of Cinemanía rated the film 2½ out of 5 stars, deeming it to be \"a formulaic and industry comedy that manages to find some good gag\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Spanish films of 2024\n\n\n== References ==",

On the south side of the building facing Jerusalem remains of a Torah ark was found.\nBased on hoards of coins found under the synagogue floor, researchers believe that the building was built around 475 CE. Beside the synagogue, the remains of an ancient oil press also stand out in the ruins. Remains of additional synagogues from the same period were also discovered a kilometer and a half to south east in the ruins of Sokho also known as Ahmadiyya, and in the Debia ruins, about three kilometers east of the site.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nHanna & David Amit - Sights : Travel with the sources in north of the country, Publication: Yad Yitzhak Ben-Zvi Institute p. 217 - 221\nDafna & Eran Meir - Synagogues in the Golan Heights, Publication: Yad Yitzhak Ben-Zvi Institute Jerusalem p. 52 - 63\n\n\n== External links ==\nA tour of the ruins of Ein Nashut (organized 22.08.2016 in the Wayback Machine archive) on the Golan tourism website\nEin Nashut, video on YouTube",

        "content": "Al-Asma'i (الأصمعي) was a short-lived Arabic-language literary and political biweekly magazine published in the Palestine region of the Ottoman Empire. Although it was printed and distributed in Jerusalem, its headquarters and offices were in Jaffa.\nThe magazine was one of the first publications to have emerged in Palestine following the 1908 Young Turk Revolution, which lifted press censorship in the empire. Al-Asma'i's first edition was published on 1 September 1908 and the last one on 1 February 1909, for a total of eleven editions over a period of five months. It was established by Hanna El-Issa, an Arab Christian businessman from Jaffa, and was intermittently joined by writers including Khalil Sakakini, Isaaf Nashashibi, and Mananah Sidawi. The publication was named after Al-Asmaʿi, an early Arab scholar.\nAl-Asma'i presented issues facing Palestinian society. It described the public's difficulties and hardships, as well as conveyed its demands. From the start, Al-Asma'i was opposed to and fearful of Zionism, and opposed Jewish immigration to Palestine from a perspective of local patriotism and Arab nationalism. The magazine frequently criticized the Zionist settlers and accused them of unfair competition with Arab craftsmen and traders, resenting the privileges they enjoyed from foreign powers, and considered them a threat to the local population.\nIt also focused on the Arab laity struggle's against the Greek clergy dominating the Jerusalem Orthodox Patriarchate's, known as the Arab Orthodox Movement. It wrote about topics of interests to Arab peasants, such as agricultural development, and promoted women's issues, including importance of them receiving education. The magazine was discontinued due to the owner Hanna El-Issa's preoccupation with the Arab Orthodox Movement, and his death on 12 September 1909. His brother Yousef El-Issa and cousin Issa El-Issa, later went on to establish Falastin in 1911, which became one of the most influential Palestinian dailies.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nPrior to 1908, the Palestine region of the Ottoman Empire had no Arabic-language press, except for an official gazette published in Jerusalem in both Arabic and Turkish. But after the Young Turk Revolution that year, which lifted press censorship in the empire, fifteen publications emerged in Palestine. Many of these leading publications were edited or published by prominent figures from the Palestinian Arab Christian community, particularly members of the Orthodox Church. Al-Asma'i magazine and Al-Quds newspaper were one of the first two publications to have emerged in Palestine in 1908.\nAl-Asma'i magazine's founder and editor was Hanna El-Issa, an Arab Christian businessman from Jaffa, who was a member of the El-Issa family, which had pioneered newspaper publishing in Palestine. Hanna was the older brother to Yousef El-Issa, and cousin to Issa El-Issa, the two figures who would go on to establish the Falastin newspaper in 1911, which became one of the most influential Palestinian dailies. Hanna also wrote for the Jerusalem-based Al-Quds newspaper owned by Jurji Habib Hannania, whose equipment he used for the printing of the magazine. Thus Al-Asma'i was printed and distributed in Jerusalem, but its headquarters and offices were in Jaffa.\nIts first issue was published on 1 September 1908 and the last one was on 1 February 1909. Being published every two weeks, it had eleven editions published over five months. In addition to Hanna El-Issa, it was intermittently edited by a number of authors including Khalil Sakakini, Isaaf Nashashibi, and Mananah Sidawi. The magazine is often mentioned in Sakakini's memoirs; in one example, he mentions in an 1908 entry: \"I washed and exercised, and after breakfast I sat at my desk, smoked my nargilah and proofread the drafts for al-Asma'i.\"\n\n\n== Political positions ==\n\n\n=== Arab Orthodox Movement ===\n\nThe Arab Orthodox Movement is a political and social movement dating since the late 19th century that aims for the Arabization of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem, which has jurisdiction over the Orthodox communities of the regions of Palestine, and Transjordan, to which most Christians there belong. Both editors Hanna El-Issa and Khalil Sakakini were Arab Christian members of the Orthodox Church and active figures in the movement, which they frequently wrote about in the magazine.\n\n\n=== Opposition to Zionism ===\n\nFrom the start, Al-Asma'i magazine was opposed to and fearful of Zionism, and opposed Jewish immigration to Palestine from a perspective of local patriotism and Arab nationalism. Scholar Neville J. Mandel considered that this represented early anti-Zionist tendencies, writing that: \"In so doing, they were in advance, sometimes very much in advance, of their readers.\"\nThe magazine frequently criticized the Zionist settlers and accused them of unfair competition with Arab craftsmen and traders, resenting the privileges they enjoyed from foreign powers, and considered them a threat to the local population. It cited how their foreign citizenships entailed them exemptions from certain taxes, and how their European skills and culture gave them other advantages. To oppose them, Al-Asma'i proposed various policies, including preference for buying locally produced goods, instead of \"foreign\", i.e. Jewish ones; and the promotion of industry and commerce by wealthy Arabs. In one article, the magazine lamented about the Jewish immigrants:\n\nThey harm the local population and wrong them, by relying on the special rights accorded to foreign powers in the Ottoman Empire and on the corruption and treachery of the local administration. Moreover, they are free from most of the taxes and heavy impositions on Ottoman subjects. Their labour competes with the local population and creates their own means of sustenance. The local population cannot stand up to their competition.\n\nIn another article in Al-Asma'i written by Arab Muslim writer Isaaf Nashashibi criticized the unwillingness and failure of the European Jewish immigrants to integrate in their new surroundings or to bother learning Arabic, which was a common theme in the Arab anti-Zionist press of the time. Nashashibi wrote that Jews \"should help in reviving this [Arabic] language after its destruction,\" and urged that they “rid their hearts of those empty aspirations like the question of Zionism or governing Palestine,” arguing that there was no chance of reaching such hopes. “If the Jews want to live a good life with us, they should unite with us in respecting this beautiful language... They should imitate our brothers, the Christians, who are founding schools and teaching this beautiful language.”\nAl-Asma'i's attacks on Zionism led to a number of complaints by Zionists to the district attorney, Yusuf Al-Hakim, representing the Ottoman Empire in Jaffa. The complaints were mainly initiated by Shimon Moyal and his wife Esther, Jews of Moroccan origin, as well as by Nissim Malul, a Jew of Tunisian origin.\n\n\n=== Other topics ===\nThe magazine also was concerned with agricultural affairs, and the state of Arab fellahin (peasants), to which it recommended that the younger generation of Arabs learn and follow Jewish agricultural methods. This point was illustrated by a comparison between the lower standard of living in large Arab villages compared to the ones in smaller Jewish colonies. It promoted creating specialized banks providing financial loans for agricultural development. It was also concerned with women's issues, highlighting the importance of them receiving education.\n\n\n== Discontinuation ==\nThe magazine's last edition appeared on 1 February 1909, as its owner Hanna El-Issa was preoccupied with the Arab Orthodox Movement and was representing Jaffa as part of an Orthodox delegation sent to the Ottoman government in Istanbul to negotiate for the establishment of a mixed council in the Jerusalem Church that would represent the Palestinian Arab community in addition to the Greek clergy; and for the provision of thirty thousand Ottoman gold pounds annually by the church for educational and social projects. Having returned from Istanbul to undergo surgery, Hanna died shortly afterwards on 12 September 1909 in Jerusalem, where he was buried at the Orthodox section of the Mount Zion Cemetery.\nThe provisions negotiated by the Orthodox delegation were not realized, which triggered a series of demonstrations and protests among the Arab laity demanding their implementation. It was at this point that Issa El-Issa left his job as a bank clerk and joined the movement against the Church by establishing the Falastin newspaper in 1911, following the advice of his late cousin Hanna who told him that establishing a new newspaper would help him reach out to a larger audience. Issa utilized on the contacts of Al-Asma'i magazine for acquiring writers for his new newspaper, which became one of the most influential Palestinian dailies.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMedia of the Ottoman Empire\nHistory of Palestinian journalism\nFalastin newspaper\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAbdelal, Wael (1 March 2012).

        "content": "Jeremy Cordle (born October 24, 1972) is a Canadian former international rugby union player.\nBorn in Cardiff, Wales, Cordle is the son of Barbadian cricketer Tony Cordle, who played his cricket for Welsh club Glamorgan. The family emigrated to Canada in the mid-1980s and after two years in Alberta would settle in Victoria, British Columbia, where Cordle was educated at St. Michaels University School.Cordle, a winger, returned to Wales briefly in 1998 to play professional rugby with Abertillery. This would become consequential for his international career in 2000 when it was discovered that it meant he failed to meet the 36-month consecutive residency requirement, meaning he had been ineligible while playing for Canada.A Castaway Wanderers player, Cordle was capped six times for the Canada national team and made his debut off the bench against Hong Kong at the 1998 Pacific Rim Rugby Championship. He then got a start in Canada's win over Japan and scored the team's first try. After three more Pacific Rim appearances in 1999, Cordle made the Canada squad to compete the 1999 Rugby World Cup, but spent the tournament sidelined by injury.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Canada national rugby union players\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJeremy Cordle at ESPNscrum",

        "content": "Mount Sheldon is a 5,686 ft (1,730 m) summit in Alaska, United States.\n\n\n== Description ==\nMount Sheldon is located in the Alaska Range and in Denali National Park and Preserve. It is situated 6.19 miles (9.96 km) northwest of Polychrome Mountain. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Toklat River. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises nearly 3,100 feet (940 meters) above the river in 1.7 mile (2.7 km).\n\n\n== Climate ==\nBased on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Sheldon is located in a tundra climate zone with long, cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Winter temperatures can drop below −20 °F with wind chill factors below −30 °F. The months May through June offer the most favorable weather for climbing or viewing.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe mountain's name was shown on a 1916 U.S. Geological Survey document and the toponym has been officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names. The name honors Charles Alexander Sheldon (1867–1928), naturalist and author of The Wilderness of Denali, who studied Dall sheep and other wildlife in the Mount McKinley (Denali) area in 1906–1908. He was the instrumental figure in Mount McKinley's establishment as a National Park.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mountains and mountain ranges of Denali National Park and Preserve\nGeology of Alaska\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWeather forecast: Mount Sheldon\nNational Park Service site: Charles Sheldon and the Mount McKinley Park Movement",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Motswasele II (died c. 1821) was the kgosi of the Kwena tribe from c. 1805 until his death c. 1821.\nMotswasele was one of three sons of kgosi Legwale, along with Segokotlo and Molese. Legwale died before Motswasele came of age, so Legwale's brother Maleke became regent, and then his brother Tshosa became regent after Maleke's death. Motswasele became kgosi when Tshosa passed the role to him c. 1805.\nMotswasele faced attacks from the Ngwaketse shortly after he became kgosi, prompting him to form an alliance with the Kgafela-Kgatl. When the Kwena came into conflict with the Birwa, Motswasele aligned with the Seletlo, and he married the daughter of the Seletlo chief. With her, he had his son Kgosidintsi.\nThe first contact between the Kwena tribe and Europeans reportedly took place under Motswasele's rule. He received the expedition led by Goddard Edward Donovan and Andrew Cowan in 1808. They gifted him European dishes and mugs, which he could use as proof that he had interacted with Europeans. The Kwena people were not familiar with European craftsmanship, so Motswasele's possession of the items caused him to be seen as Modimowage (transl. god of the village).\nMotswasele's rule was characterised by conflict within the Kwena tribe. Throughout his rule, he seized the crops, cattle, and wives of his subjects, and he made frequent use of capital punishment.  A dispute with Motswasele caused the Maoto ward to leave the Kwena tribe and join the Ngwaketse tribe. The traditional understanding is that Motswasele gave preferential treatment to the Maoto ward head, Motshebe, so Motshebe's opponents chose not to inform Motshebe when he had been summoned. Motswasele responded to Motshebe's absence by sending mercenaries to his home, and Motshebe led his people away from the tribe.\nMoruakgomo, the son of Tshosa, resented that his father made Motswasele kgosi. He responded by turning Motswasele against his supporters, convincing him to penalise them, and then gaining their trust for himself. After gaining support within the tribe, Moruakgomo plotted with Motswasele's brother Segokotlo to assassinate Motswasele. In his pride, Motswasele ignored warnings of the plot. As he left the meeting in Shokwane c. 1821 where he was set to be assassinated, he was followed and killed by a man wielding an axe. He was buried on the spot where he was killed. Following Motswasele's death, the Kwena tribe underwent a schism as both Moruakgomo and Segokotlo ruled their own factions. This was followed by the conflicts of the Difaqane before the Kwena were reunified under Sechele I.\n\n\n== Explanatory footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Workes cited ==\nOkihiro, Gary Y.

She is currently the first lady of Costa Rica, as she is the wife of President Rodrigo Chaves.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nDaughter of Gunars and Nina Zeikate. She has an older sister named Yolanta.\nFrom the ages of 7 to 19, she practiced dancing. She was a national ballroom dance champion in her country in the late 1980s.\nZeikate earned a master's in economics from the University of Latvia and studied in the public policy doctoral program.\nShe was the head of the municipal finance department of the Latvian Ministry of Finance. She headed the unit that supervised and evaluated the financial viability of subnational governments and represented the Ministry of Finance on the State Subnational Debt and Guarantees Board.\nHe has written multiple research reports and prepared projects related to public finances.\nIn 2001, he received the Hubert Humphrey Honorary Fellowship from the United States Congress to study at the American University in Washington DC which allowed him to work for the World Bank in Washington. There, she met her future husband, who also worked at the World Bank.\nBefore settling in Costa Rica, the couple lived in Jakarta, Indonesia, for five years, where Chaves was director of one of the largest offices of the World Bank.\nAfter more than 20 years working at the World Bank, she announced that she was resigning from her position to assume her role as first lady, from which she will focus her work on the planning and coordination of alliances that provide support for the comprehensive development of Costa Rican children and youth.\nZeikate assured that they would prioritize children from less advantaged backgrounds and areas with a higher incidence of poverty. The transversal theme will be gender equality and the empowerment of girls.\nThrough links with the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Culture, and Youth, among others, the pillars of prioritization for the first lady are learning (English and technology), protection (coexistence and anti-bullying), recreation (culture and sports), and physical and mental health.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Muhammad Amin Bahadur Khan (Uzbek: Muhammad Aminxon; Russian: Мухаммад Амин-хан) (Khiva, 1817 - Sarahs, 1855), was the 7th Khan of the Uzbek Kungrat dynasty in the Khanate of Khiva. He reigned between 1845 and 1855, when he was killed in battle.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMuhammad Amin was the son of Allah Kuli Bahadur Khan and ascended to the throne in 1845, after the death of his brother Muhammad Rahim Quli Khan (1842–1845). As Khan, he attempted to strengthen the central power and subdue the constant rebellion of the Turkmen tribes, but without much success. He also led a dozen raids against Merv and Khorasan. After six campaigns he conquered the citadel of Merv and the fortress of Ýolöten.\nDuring the reign of Muhammad Amin Khan, diplomatic relations were maintained with the Russian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, Iran and Afghanistan.\nThe Khivans had dominated the Kazakhs in recent years, but control over the lower Syr Darya was disputed by the Khanate of Kokand, while the Russian Empire also claimed sovereignty over the Kazakhs. In December 1846, emissaries of the Khan headed to Orenburg, a Russian border city, and from there to the capital Saint Petersburg, where they arrived on 19 March 1847. \nThe two envoys of the Khan demanded the demolition of the Raim fort (ru) built by the Russians near the mouth of the Syr-Darya River into the Aral Sea. Tsar Nicholas I was categorically opposed and small skirmishes followed in 1847-1848 between Russian soldiers and the Khan's warriors. Having suffered setbacks and with his army exhausted, Muhammad Amin Khan decided to send a new emissary to St. Petersburg in 1850, but the talks came to nothing.\n\n\n=== Death ===\nIn 1855, Muhammad Amin led an expedition to the Sarahs oasis against the Turkmen Teke tribe to conquer present-day southern Turkmenistan. The Teke asked support from the Persian governor of Mashhad, Feridun Mirza, who sent 7,000 men from the citadel of Derbent and another 3,000 from Khorasan with 10 cannons.\nThe following battle turned into a defeat for the Khiva Khan, in which his 6 cannons were taken by the Persians and his troops dispersed.\nMuhammad Amin was surprised in his camp by a division from Merv commanded by Muhammad Hussein, taken prisoner and then beheaded.  His head is said to have been sent to the Shah of Persia, who ordered an honorable burial.\nHis son Abdullah succeeded him, but he too died six months later in a battle with rebellious tribes. His second son Kutlug Murad was next to ascend the throne, but experienced the same fate. Finally his uncle Sayyid Muhammad Khan (1856–1864) ascended to the throne and was able to restore some order.\n\n\n== Cultural influence ==\n\nIt was under the reign of Muhammad Amin that one of the largest and most richly decorated madrasas in the city was built in Khiva, the Muhammad Amin Khan Madrasah which could accommodate up to 260 students. A large amount of land was allocated in different parts of the Khanate, to cover the costs of maintaining the madrasah, students and teachers.\nThe sovereign also built the Kalta Minor minaret, one of the symbols of the city. Kalta Minor was originally intended to be the tallest minaret in the world, but with the death of Mohammad Amin Khan, the  unfinished construction was stopped. Today, both monuments belong to the walled city of Itchan Kala, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nGulomov Kh.

        "content": "Harriet \"Ma\" Pullen (August 13, 1860 – August 9, 1947), was an American entrepreneur and hotelier in Skagway, Alaska. After running a freighting company, she bought a house and coverted it into the luxurious Pullen House Hotel.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nShe was born to Andrew Jackson and Mary Jane Stewart Smith in Mount Hope, Wisconsin, on August 13, 1860. On February 23, 1881, she married Daniel Webster Pullen. They had a farm in Cape Flattery, Washington, and had four children, Dan, Royal, Mildred and Chester. (Eldest son Dan would later become the first appointment to West Point from Alaska and an All-American football right tackle in 1909, as well as a colonel in World War I.) She left her children with friends in Seattle and traveled to Skagway to earn enough money to support them.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nArriving in Skagway in early 1897 with only $7 (according to her), she quickly found work as a cook for the workers of Captain William Moore, one of the founders of the settlement. In her spare time, she took discarded tin cans and beat them into pie pans. She baked and sold apple pies to prospectors passing through on their way to the Klondike Gold Rush. She used her profits to start a freighting company, which provided transportation on the White Pass trail. When the White Pass and Yukon Route railroad opened, her business waned, so she purchased a house from Moore and turned it into the luxurious and very successful Pullen House Hotel. With her finances secured, she sent for her children. Her husband arrived sometime later, but left, seeking his own fortune in the Klondike. She became famous for her hospitality and acquired the nickname \"Ma\".\nPullen was also a suffragist. A women's suffrage bill was the first bill passed by both the House and Senate of the Alaskan Territory, being signed into law on March 21, 1913. After the bill passed, she used a wagon, called the \"Pullen House Bus\", to help women reach polling locations in Alaska. Pullen supported temperance and her wagon had a sign that read, \"Vote Dry and Protect Your Home.\"\nWhen she died in 1947, she was buried near her hotel.\nHer great-granddaughter Eleanor Phillips Brackbill wrote a biography about her, The Queen of Heartbreak Trail: The Life and Times of Harriet Smith Pullen, Pioneering Woman.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nSpude, Catharine Holder (2015).

        "content": "The Welsh National and Universal Mining Disaster Memorial Garden at Senghenydd, Caerphilly, commemorates the 439 men killed in the Senghenydd colliery disaster of 1913, the worst mining accident in British history; the 81 lives lost in an earlier pit explosion at Senghenydd in 1901; and acts as a national memorial to all of the dead of the 152 mining disasters that have occurred in Wales. The garden was opened in 2013, the centenary of the 1913 event. In March 2024 Cadw added the garden to its Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales. Its listing record describes the garden as \"an important site of public commemoration and memory\".\n\n\n== History and description ==\nThe Universal Colliery at Senghenydd was in operation from 1893 to 1928. An important mine within the South Wales Coalfield, at its peak of production during the First World War it was supplying 10,000 tons of coal a week to fuel the British Grand Fleet based at Scapa Flow. An explosion at the mine in May 1901 saw the deaths of 81 men. An even greater explosion in the mine on 14 October 1913 became the greatest colliery disaster in British mining history, with the loss of 439 men and boys. The subsequent government inquiry, which saw the mine manager fined £24 and the colliery owners £10, caused great bitterness.\nA memorial to the Universal Colliery disasters was unveiled on 14 October 1981 at the gates of the Nant-y-Parc Primary School. A second memorial followed in 2006. The National Mining Memorial was unveiled at a ceremony on 14 October 2013, the centenary of the 1913 disaster. The memorial takes the form of a bronze sculpture, by Les Johnson, depicting a miner leading another to safety. The surrounding garden, designed by Stephanie Wilkins, includes a remembrance wall and a memory path commemorating the dead of the 152 mining disasters in Wales. The 521 clay tiles commemorating individual losses were made by Ned Heywood and Julia Land, ceramic artists from Chepstow.\nThe garden is registered at Grade II on the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales.  At the time of its listing, the then First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford said, \"the legacy of coal is still an essential part of our history. It is only right that a site of such symbolic importance as Wales’ National Mining Memorial receives formal recognition\". Cadw's listing record for the site describes it as \"an important site of public commemoration and memory\".\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Haunted House is the 7th episode of the second season of The Ren & Stimpy Show that originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on 21 November 1992.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nRen and Stimpy are driving their car and stop at a sinister looking house at night. The duo enter the house, which they soon discover is haunted by a ghost who desperately wants to scare them. Ren and Stimpy decided to stay the night at the haunted house as neither finds the ghost very frightening and end up humiliating the ghost in various ways. Despondent over his failure to frighten Ren and Stimpy, the ghost admits his failure as a ghost and says he wants to commit suicide. Stimpy provides the ghost with a poison, which he drinks to commit suicide, which causes to come back to life as a naked man who steals Ren and Stimpy's car.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of John Kricfalusi\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nThe fat, naked black guy-Rudolph Porter\nThe Ghost-voice of Billy West\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe story that became Haunted House was written for the Tiny Toon Adventures in 1990 under the title \"Hi-Spirits\". The story had featured Hamton Pig and Gogo Dodo visiting a haunted house where a ghost tries to scare them. The story had entered the storyboard phrase and the actor Don Messick had recorded the dialogue for the ghost. The producers of Tiny Toon Adventures rejected the story and the Spümcø studio still owned the rights to the story. John Kricfalusi, the owner of the Spümcø studio decided to turn the story into an episode of The Ren & Stimpy Show for the second season.. The drawing done in 1990 were used for the story, and the animator Richard Pursel simply inserted Ren and Stimpy in place of Hamton Pig and Gogo Dodo. Haunted House was scheduled to premiere in October 1992 close to Halloween as fitting its ghost theme, but production was so far behind that in July 1992 Kricfalusi hired Ron Hughart to take over production of Haunted House and move the story forward to meet the October deadline. Hughart stated that he took the job of directing Haunted House \"to help Krcfalusi out of a spot more than anything else\".. Production on Haunted House picked up speed after Hughart took over, and by August 1992 the episode was shipped out the Color Key studio in Taiwan to be illustrated.. After the Spümcø studio lost the contract for The Ren & Stimpy Show on 21 September 1992, the Games Animation studio added in a new scene of the ghost trying to kill Stimpy in the shower that was a homage to the shower murder in the 1960 film Psycho.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe episode has been heavily criticized by the critic Bill Gibron for the amount of censorship imposed, mostly notably the removal of the scene where the ghost places a  bloody severed human head on Ren's bed. Other critics such as Stephen Wilds criticized the episode for the amount of violence involved such as the scene where the ghost uses an ax to try to behead himself.\n\n\n== Books ==\nKlickstein, Matthew; Summers, Marc (2013).

        "content": "Mazllom Kumnova (born 17 March 1946) is a former politician in Kosovo. He was the interim mayor of Gjakova from 1999 to 2001 and served in the Assembly of Kosovo from 2005 to 2007. Kumnova is a member of the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK).\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nKumnova was born to a Kosovo Albanian family in Gjakova, in what was then the Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija in the People's Republic of Serbia, Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. He has a degree in philology and a master's degree in literature teaching methodology. He earned a Ph.D. after the end of his political career.\nHe was incarcerated by Serbian authorities as a political prisoner in the 1990s and fought with the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) in the 1998–99 Kosovo War.\n\n\n== Politician ==\n\n\n=== Mayor of Gjakova (1999–2001) ===\nThe Kosovo Liberation Army entered Gjakova in June 1999 with the departure of Serbian authorities and appointed Kumnova as mayor of the city. The United Nations had agreed to establish a civil authority in Kosovo but was still in the process of settling up the authority at this time. Referring to this, Kumnova said, \"With the end of the war, the KLA will form also the civil government. This government will be until we have elections. [...] I notice that the U.N. is going to do this organization of the administration, but they are late. We couldn't leave a vacuum without a government.\" Shortly thereafter, he added, \"There's no reason for an outsider to do what we can do for ourselves. Our people are hard working and self-reliant. We can run our own affairs.\"\nEven after the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) arrived in Gjakova later in the year, Kumnova and ex-KLA soldiers remained in positions of real authority. A November 1999 report in the German media quotes him as saying, sarcastically, \"UNMIK has not taken over the municipality, I am horrified by this vacuum.\"\nPerhaps improbably, Kumnova was a founding member of the Party for the Democratic Progress of Kosovo (PPDK) in October 1999. He did not join the successor Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK), however, but instead became the leader of a local branch of the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo in May 2000.\nIn May 2000, a court in Serbia sentenced 143 ethnic Albanians from the Gjakova area to long jail terms on charges of terrorism. Kumnova responded by accusing Serbia of \"fighting another war against Kosovo.\"\nKumnova led the AAK's electoral list for Gjakova in the 2000 Kosovan local elections and was elected to the local assembly when the list won seven mandates. The Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) won a majority government in the city, and Kumnova's mayoral term ended shortly thereafter.\nHe appeared in the seventeenth position on the AAK's list in the 2001 Kosovan parliamentary election, which was held under closed list proportional representation. The party won eight seats, and he was not elected. He again led the AAK's list for Gjakova in the 2002 local elections and was re-elected when the list won ten seats. The LDK won a second consecutive victory in the city.\n\n\n=== Parliamentarian (2005–07) ===\nKumnova appeared in the eleventh position on the AAK's list in the 2004 Kosovan parliamentary election. The list won nine seats, and he was not immediately elected. The LDK won the election and afterward formed a coalition government with the AAK. Some AAK delegates resigned their seats to take positions in government, and Kumnova received an assembly mandate as a replacement delegate in 2005. He served on the budget and finance committee in the term that followed.\nKosovo adopted a system of open list proportional representation prior to the 2007 Kosovan parliamentary election. Kumnova was given the twenty-ninth position on the AAK's list and finished thirty-seventh among its candidates. The list won ten seats, and he was not elected.\n\n\n=== Since 2007 ===\nKumnova appeared in the one-hundredth position on the AAK's electoral list in the 2014 Kosovan parliamentary election and finished seventy-ninth among its candidates. The list won eleven seats, and he was again not elected.\nIn 2021, he was chair of the steering committee of the University \"Fehmi Agani\" in Gjakova.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Church of Saint Elia also Zakare's church, is located in Kizkale, near Ani in Turkey. It was built by the Zakarids in the early 13th century, as well as the nearby church of Tigran Honents.\nThe building of the church came at a tumultuous period: in 1064 the city of Ani had been captured by the Seljuks from the Byzantines, who granted it to a Kurdish line of Muslim emirs known as the Sheddadids. Then in 1199, the Zakarids, vassals of the Kingdom of Georgia, captured Ani with a combined Georgian and Armenian army. Ani was then captured and destroyed by the Mongols in 1239.\nPart of an inscription on the church reports its building at the time of Queen Tamar (ruled 1184–1213) by Zakare amirspasalar (Commander-in-Chief of the Georgian army), probably circa 1200:  \n\nIn the time of the queen of Queen T'amar, annointed by God and pious, I, Shahanshah Zak'aria amirspasalar, her faithful servant, son of the great Sargis Mkhargrtzeli, by the will of God erected this monument... in this monastery, close to the church built by our Illuminator, Saint Grigor.\"\nIn another part of the inscription the brothers Ivane and Zakare are described as \"Kings of Armenia\".\nParts of the church have collapsed in the 1988 earthquake.\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Ani, église d'Aghjkaberd (Many high quality photographs)\".

He was knighted in 1845.\nNils Abraham was born in Ithis parish of Kymmenegårds now Nvlands County. His father Jacob Johan Ursinus was provost and priest married to Engel Christina Nohrström, daughter of Abraham Nohrström who had moved from Dalarne in Sweden to Finland. The family name came from their origins in the 17th century in Karhula farm with karhu meaning bear which in Latin is ursus. He was educated first at home and then at the Borgå Gymnasium before entering Abo Academy in 1805. He took the philosophy candidat exam in 1809 and under professor Johan Gadolin he completed his doctorate and Artim Liberalium Magister in 1810. He then went to study medicine and took the licenciate exam in 1812 and in 1813 he defended under Joseph Pipping (later Pippingskold) a dissertation titled De morbis viarum lacrymalium cognoscendis et curandis. He received his medical doctorate in 1817. In 1812 he was appointed to a college of medicine at the Abo Academy and in 1825 he became professor of anatomy. In 1813 he was made head vaccinator for Finland. He was prorector fo the university from 1834 and in 1839 he was made rector. He resigned as rector in 1845 and later as professor emeritus. He loved swimming and promoted it for health. His favourite spot on the sea was called Ursin's rock.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiography",

However, this did not happen, and Cumming was elected to the role unopposed.\nIn September 2019, six months before the 2020 Brisbane City Council election, Cumming stepped down as leader and Jared Cassidy took his place.\nOn 13 January 2023, Cumming was charged with mid-range drink driving after he was found asleep behind the wheel of a parked car by police following a Christmas Eve party. Three months later, he announced he would resign from council.\nCumming officially resigned on 12 May 2023, and was replaced days later by Sara Whitmee.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Julie Bornstein (born July 17, 1938) is an American attorney and politician from California and a member of the Democratic Party.\nBornstein served as a member of the Desert Community College Board of Trustees from 1989 until 1992, when she was elected to the California State Assembly.\n\n\n== State Assembly ==\nPreviously numbered the 73rd, the new 80th Assembly district, had been redrawn during reapportionment and was open after incumbent David G. Kelley (R-Hemet) opted to instead run for State Senate. Initially Bornstein faced a primary challenge from sitting assemblyman Steve Clute (D-Riverside), whose old district had been dismantled and part of which wound up redrawn here. At the last minute, he chose to retire instead, though his name remained on the ballot. In the general election, Bornstein defeated incumbent assemblywoman Tricia Hunter (R-San Diego), who like Clute saw her old district split up by reapportionment and part of which ended up redrawn here.\nBornstein was awarded the prestigious \"rookie of the year\" from California Journal.Speaker Willie Brown elevated her to Democratic caucus chair, leading to speculation she was being groomed to be a future speaker. All this attention, and the fact that she represented a marginal seat made her the GOP's number one target for the 1994 elections. Even so, they failed to field a top-tier candidate after Hunter declined a rematch. In the 1994 election, the Republican party did very well in California, and she lost to television advertising executive Jim Battin by 12 points, even though he was not initially seen as a threat.\n\n\n== Other posts ==\nAfter her stint in the legislature, Bornstein served as Chief of Staff for California Controller Kathleen Connell, as well as Chief Deputy Controller for External Affairs from 1997 until 1999. She was then appointed by Governor Gray Davis as Director of Housing and Community Development, a post she held from 1999 until 2004.\nFrom 2004 to 2006 she served as president for the Campaign for Affordable Housing\n\n\n== Congressional run ==\nIn 2008 Bornstein ran for the U.S. House of Representatives 45th district, then represented by Mary Bono (R-Palm Desert). Although that year saw big gains for Democrats, Bornstein scored just 41.7% of the vote against the incumbent.\n\n\n== Electoral history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Dennis Simoes (c. 1901 – c. 1957) was a Goan theatre actor and female impersonator known for his work in tiatr productions.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSimoes was introduced to the realm of commercial tiatr, a distinctive form of Goan musical theater, by playwright Aleixinho De Candolim during one of his productions. This encounter marked the beginning of Simoes' involvement in several tiatrs led by the Konkani singer Minguel Rod. It was through his collaborations with Minguel Rod that Simoes gained prominence as an actor, captivating audiences in Goa and leaving an impression on the tiatr community. Minguel Rod, recognizing Simoes' abilities, astutely crafted roles that perfectly complemented his skills within the framework of his tiatrs. Simoes garnered acclaim for his portrayal of a bhattkar (landlord) in Minguel Rod's Intruz vo Carnaval (Intruz or Carnival), a role that elevated his status and continues to be revered to this day. Throughout his career, Simoes assumed a diverse range of characters, including bhattkars (landlords), fathers, and gouio (simpleton). One notable performance included his portrayal of a simpleton bridegroom in Farikponn (Amends), a tiatr by the Konkani actor Anthony De Sa. Simoes also exhibited versatility by embodying female characters, demonstrating his finesse as a female impersonator. His portrayal of a simpleton bride in the Konkani film actor C. Alvares' Conn To Mali? (Who is that gardener?) further solidified his popularity and recognition. Moreover, Simoes had the opportunity to collaborate with a host of popular artists in the tiatr Gorb (Pride), a production scripted and directed by the Goan theater actor and singer P. Nazareth (Peter Anthony Nazareth). The ensemble cast featured figures such as the Konkani comedian Jacinto Vaz, singer Remmie Colaço, and the film actor Shaikh.\n\nSimoes was among the early Goan Konkani tiatrists who played a pivotal role in advancing the Konkani tiatr tradition throughout the first half of the 20th century. During this period, various tiatrists had varying degrees of longevity and made significant contributions as playwrights and song composers. Simoes was a member of the trio known as Kid-Young-Rod, known for their trio songs that drew large crowds to the theaters. Any tiatr production presented under the banner of Kid (Kid Boxer)-Young (Young Menezes)-Rod (Minguel Rod) guaranteed a sold-out performance. Simoes collaborated with fellow members of this group, including Master Vaz, Edward Almeida, Miss Marekin, C. Pereira, Miss Julie, Miss Estrela, and Cruz Jazzwala. Over time, some members departed, and their positions were filled by Valente Mascarenhas, Joao Inas, P. Nazareth, and Andrew Ferns. Simoes actively participated in the early phase of tiatr from 1892 to the 1930s, a period recognized as the pioneering era by professor André Raphael Fernandes of Goa University, an author on the subject. During this period, playwrights were the trailblazers and the first to reap the rewards. Konkani writer and historian Wilson Mazarello, in an article for The Times of India, acknowledges Simoes as one of the early Konkani tiatrists who captivated audiences in both Bombay (now Mumbai) and Goa with his theatrical performances.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nDennis Simoes, born in 1901 in the town of Candolim in Bardez taluka, Goa, had a relatively obscure early and personal life, with limited accessible information through online and print sources. During that period, Goa was under Portuguese rule as part of Portuguese India during the Portuguese Empire (now located in India). Later in life, Simoes relocated to Bombay, which was part of Bombay Presidency in British India and is presently recognized as Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. In Bombay, he entered into a marriage with Carlota Simoes, a well-known dixtticarn (exorcist or individual specializing in expelling evil spirits) from the Byculla locality in South Bombay, now referred to as South Mumbai, India. Simoes spent the remainder of his life in Bombay until his death in 1957.\n\n\n== Selected stage works ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Louise M. Lawson (née Andrews; 1855–1951) was an American temperance activist who served as President of the Wisconsin State Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU).\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLouise Mahala Andrews was born at Baraboo, Wisconsin, May 10, 1855.\nShe was educated in the Wisconsin public schools.\nOn August 10, 1870, she married William Averill Lawson (d. December 7, 1899), also of Baraboo.\nEarly becoming interested in the temperance movement, Lawson was an active member of the local Band of Hope and of the International Organisation of Good Templars (IOGT), and held office in both organizations. She was for several years president of the Sauk County, Wisconsin WCTU, and in 1890, was elected corresponding secretary of the Wisconsin Union. In 1905, she was chosen vice-president of the State WCTU, and in 1907, she was elected State president, which office she held for eleven years, and at the termination of this period, was made president emeritus for life. While retiring from this position in 1918, she continued to represent the WCTU on the Woman's Committee of the State Council of National Defense, and continued to hold two State WCTU offices.\nIn 1902, she was appointed State lecturer for the organization, and served in that capacity at least until 1928. At various times, she was State Superintendent of Legislation, of Christian Citizenship, and of Parliamentary Usage. She was a delegate to the international conventions at Boston, Brookline, Glasgow, and Philadelphia.\nAs a reward for services rendered, the Wisconsin State Union tendered to Lawson a life membership in the State, National, and World's WCTU, and her name was placed in the Book of Remembrance at the national headquarters of the organization at Evanston, Illinois.\nLouise M. Lawson died in Chicago, Illinois, August 11, 1951. Interment was in Baraboo, Wisconsin.\n\n\n== References ==",

Dick was not a resident of the ward at the time he announced his candidacy, but announced he would relocate from his home in Clayfield, and was endorsed by prime minister Kevin Rudd.\nDick was deputy leader of the opposition on council until 2012. At the election in March of that year, he substantially increased the Labor majority with a 13.7% swing in his favour, and he was subsequently made leader of the opposition, serving in that role until 2016.\n\n\n== Councillors for Richlands Ward ==\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n=== 2004 ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Woman on the Internet is the debut studio album by the Irish singer-songwriter and guitarist Orla Gartland, released on 20 August 2021 by New Friends.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn 16 October 2020, Gartland released a single called \"Pretending\". The song discusses the difficulty and trouble of pretending to be the person someone else wants, in order to be a \"people pleaser\". This was the first single to be released from Woman on the Internet. The second single, \"More Like You\", was released on 13 January 2021. According to Gartland herself, the song deals with identity, jealousy, and the desire to have the life of someone who seems to have everything easy. The third single, \"Zombie!\", was released on 13 April 2021. It deals with the topic of toxic masculinity and with Gartland entreating another individual to open up about their emotions and stop repressing their true feelings. The song was produced alongside Pete Robertson, a producer for Beabadoobee and the Vaccines.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWoman on the Internet at Discogs (list of releases)",

It is situated 3.43 miles (5.52 km) southwest of Igloo Mountain at Sable Pass near mile 40 of the Park Road which traverses the mountain's southern slope. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains west to the Toklat River and east to the Teklanika River. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises 2,000 feet (610 meters) above Tattler Creek in one mile (1.6 km). The mountain's name was shown on a 1916 U.S. Geological Survey document and the toponym has been officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nBased on the Köppen climate classification, Sable Mountain is located in a tundra climate zone with long, cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Winter temperatures can drop below −20 °F with wind chill factors below −30 °F. The months May through June offer the most favorable weather for climbing or viewing.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mountains and mountain ranges of Denali National Park and Preserve\nGeology of Alaska\n\n\n== Gallery ==",

However, he died of a heart attack in December 2007.\nAs a result of the redistribution, Wishart councillor Graham Quirk moved to MacGregor Ward, and Krista Adams successfully ran for the Liberals in 2008.

        "content": "The Bonnel Pit of the Aniche Mining Company is a former coal mine in the Mining Basin of Nord-Pas-de-Calais, located in Lallaing. The two shafts were started in 1913 and 1914, while the Bernard and Lemay pits were under construction in the north of the concession. The war halted the works, which were not resumed until 1921, the year in which the pit was repaired. The sinking of shaft No. 1 was completed on December 10, 1921, and the pit began production in 1923, with shaft No. 2 coming into service two years later. The Barrois Pit was commissioned in 1931, a little more than two kilometers east of the Bonnel Pit.\nThe Aniche Mining Company was nationalized in 1946, and became part of the Douai Group. Shaft No. 1 was deepened for concentration on the Barrois Pit, which was effective in 1964. Bonnel then provided service until 1974 and ventilation until June 30, 1984, the date on which the Barrois concentration closed. The shafts were backfilled in 1985, and the installations were destroyed the following year.\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, Charbonnages de France marked the heads of shafts Bonnel Nos. 1 and 2. Four buildings of the pit remain, as well as the mining towns, whether they were built before or after nationalization.\n\n\n== The Pit ==\n Media related to Bonnel Pit at Wikimedia Commons\nWhile the Aniche Mining Company had begun to exploit the northern part of its concession in the previous decade by opening the Déjardin and De Sessevalle pits, it opened new pits in the north of its concession in the 1910s: Bernard, Lemay, and Bonnel. These did not really start producing until after World War I.\n\n\n=== Sinking ===\nA new pit was started south of Lallaing, 2280 meters east-southeast of the Déjardin pit, and 4590 meters west-northwest of the Lemay pit.\nThe sinking of Bonnel shaft No. 1 began in 1913, with a diameter of 5.10 meters. The casing was made of cast iron from 90 centimeters to 89.20 meters deep. The coal seam was reached at 148.50 meters. Shaft No. 2 was started in 1914, 55 meters west of shaft No. 1, with a diameter of four meters, a scheme common to the Lemay pit, and to a lesser extent De Sessevalle. The casing was in cast iron from 90 centimeters to 89.32 meters deep. The coal seam was reached at 147.50 meters. Due to World War I, the sinking of shaft No. 1 was stopped on July 4, 1914, at a depth of 189 meters. The sinking of the second shaft was also suspended.\nThe pit was repaired after the war. Work on shaft No. 1 resumed on July 15, 1921, and was completed on December 10 at a depth of 300 meters. Shaft No. 2 was also resumed that year.\n\n\n=== Operation ===\nThe Aniche Mining Company acquired the Flines Mining Company on January 13, 1922. Extraction began in 1923. Shaft No. 2 was put into service in 1925.\nThe Barrois Pit, started four years earlier, began producing in 1931, located 2245 meters east-southeast of the Bonnel Pit.\nThe Aniche Mining Company was nationalized in 1946, and became part of the Douai Group. The last level was then at 290 meters, but the pit was deepened for concentration on Barrois, which was effective in 1964. From that date, like the Lemay Pit from 1965, the Bonnel Pit provided ventilation and service for the concentration, while the extraction was carried out through the Barrois Pit. The service ceased in 1974, two years after the Lemay Pit. Ventilation ceased on June 30, 1984, when the Barrois concentration closed.\nThe Bonnel shafts Nos. 1 and 2, respectively 500 and 305 meters deep, were backfilled in 1985. Eight levels were established in the first shaft at 160, 199, 225, 290, 303, 358, 413, and 495 meters, while shaft No. 2 had four levels, established at 160, 198, 225, and 290 meters. The headframe of shaft Bonnel No. 1 was dynamited on April 2, 1986, and that of shaft No. 2 on April 15.\n\n\n=== Conversion ===\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, Charbonnages de France marked the heads of shafts Bonnel Nos. 1 and 2. The BRGM conducts inspections there every year.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe pit retains the guard's house, offices, workshop-store-boiler room, and bathhouses.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== The slag heaps ==\nLike the Déjardin or Lemay pits, the Bonnel pit does not have its own slag heap. The creation of the Barrois pit at the end of the 1920s led to the construction of a railway branch from the Bonnel pit, established on the cavalier slag heap No. 250, known asCavalier de Bonnel to Barrois. When the Bonnel pit was concentrated on the Barrois pit, its waste was sent to the slag heaps Nos. 143 and 143A, Germinies Sud and Germinies Nord.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== The settlements ==\n Media related to Settlements of the Bonnel pit at Wikimedia Commons\n\nLarge settlements were built to the northwest of the pit. After nationalization, additional housing was also built, including some camus.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes and references ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The Targum Rishon, also known as the First Targum of Esther in the Hebrew, is an Aramaic translation (targum) and elaboration of the Book of Esther. Much less apocryphal material is used to embellish its account compared with Targum Sheni (also known as the Second Targum of Esther), and it is also significantly shorter, as Targum Sheni is two and a half times its length. Neither should be confused with another targum of Esther mentioned by tractate Megillah of the Talmud, which is an earlier but now lost text. Targum Rishon is dated approximately between 500 and 700, and is of Palestinian provenance. It postdates the Babylonian Talmud. One recent analysis, though the conclusion remains tentative, places both targums no later than the early seventh century and in Palestine, composed roughly in the same period; furthermore, it proposes that both derive from an earlier rabbinic text known as Esther Rabbati.\nThe text alternates between word-for-word renderings of Esther and entire rewrites. The majority of the time, only a few words are added to clarify the meaning of the passage. One is example is Targum Rishon to Esther 3:5: \"Haman became filled with anger against Mordekhai\" (italics added). One case of a lengthy insertion is in Targum Rishon 1:1. The original verse reads:It happened during the days of the wicked Xerxes, the Xerxes who ruled 127 provinces, from India to Western Ethiopia.Whereas the Targum reads:It happened during the days of the wicked Xerxes, the Xerxes in whose days (the decree allowing) work on the house of the great God was revoked. It remained revoked until the second year of Darius on the advice of the sinful Vashti , daughter of Evil Merodakh, son of Nebukhadnezzar. Because she did not permit the rebuilding of the Temple, it was decreed she be executed in the nude. And because Xerxes listened to her advice, his life was shortened and his kingdom was split up. Previously all peoples, nations, and (speakers of various) languages, and provinces were under his rule, but now they were no longer subjected to him. In view of this fact, and subsequently, when it was revealed before the Lord that Vashti would be killed and that he was destined to marry Esther, who was a descendant of Sarah, who lived 127 years, he was given an extension and he ruled 127 provinces, from India to Western Ethiopia.The passage adds significant new information about Ahasuerus and Vashti. Vashti is now cast as the granddaughter of Nebuchadnezzar II, who destroyed the Second Temple, explaining why Targum Rishon portrays her so negatively. Another fantastic embellishment can be found in Targum Rishon 6:1. Overall, Targum Rishon tends to add more midrashic material as opposed to directly interpreting the text.Another addition Targum Rishon adds is to make Esther a much more religious and Jewish text. The original text does not mention God or any recognizably Jewish practices. In Targum Rishon, God becomes an active participant in the progression of the story, for example by punishing Haman, and later again saving his people from Haman's decree. Esther performs a lengthy prayer to gain favor with the king and overcome the evil plans of Haman in Targum Rishon 5:1, and so forth. Furthermore, Esther now performs a variety of Jewish practices, including the observance of Shabbat and the festivals, and she follows menstrual restrictions and food regulations. References are also made to Abraham, Jacob, and Isaac to link Israel to their past.\n\n\n== Manuscripts ==\nThe earliest manuscripts of Targum Rishon range between the 14th and 16th centuries. They are known from Spain, France, Italy and Algeria.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRabbinic literature\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Volodymyr Pavlovych Matvienko (Ukrainian: Володи́мир Па́влович Матвіє́нко; born 5 January 1938) is a Ukrainian poet-songwriter, economist and politician who is a recipient of both the Hero of Ukraine and Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise. Additionally, he was the first chairman of the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) from 1991 to 1992.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBorn on 5 January 1938, in the Ukrainian village of Bilka. Matvienko completed his postgraduate studies at the Kyiv Institute of National Economy in 1967 after earning a degree in finance and credit from the Kyiv Financial and Economic Institute in 1959. He was given the academic title of professor in 1992. He was given the title of professor of the department of banking in 1992 by the Kyiv Institute of National Economy.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHis career journey began in July 1959 when he started as a credit inspector at the Zhdaniv branch of the Budbank of the USSR in the Donetsk Oblast. Progressing steadily, he became the manager of the Artemivske branch in 1964, later assuming roles such as deputy manager of the Donetsk regional office, manager of the Dnipropetrovsk regional office, and eventually deputy manager of the Ukrainian SSR office of the Budbank of the USSR, where he served from 1982 to 1987.\nTransitioning to higher positions, he took on the role of chairman of the board of the Ukrainian Republic Bank of Prombudbank of the USSR from 1987 to 1991. In 1991, Matvienko's career trajectory shifted significantly when he was appointed chairman of the board of the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU). Notably, he implemented innovative measures such as reusable coupons to counteract inflation in the early 1990s, effectively averting a severe cash crisis in Ukraine.\nOn 6 June 1991, Matvienko was elected as the first chairman of the NBU board by deputies with almost unanimous consent. He noted that the national bank operated under harsh, conflicting circumstances, much like the fledgling state of Ukraine. Nonetheless, the NBU completed many other responsibilities associated with the establishment of the state's central bank, including the formation of a domestic monetary system, a system of credit control, a mechanism for supporting international economic activity, and monetary settlements.\nIn September 1991, the Government Courier newspaper published an article in which Matvienko discussed the state of affairs at the moment, pointing out that the intricacy of the money issue extends beyond simple manufacturing. Should they launch their own currency, certain legal acts will need to be developed and enacted. Establish the notion of monetary reform, the pricing structure, and the new monetary unit's exchange rate to foreign currencies.\nDirect work was done on the hryvnia's creation at the same period. The hryvnia currency design was created by Ukrainian painters Vasyl Lopata and Boris Maksimov, and Matvienko authorized prototypes of the first bills. He signed large banknotes that Thomas de la Rue printed in London.\nMaksimov's influence continued to shape the banking landscape as in 1992, the corporatization of Budbank led to the establishment of the Ukrainian Joint Stock Commercial Industrial and Investment Bank (Prominvestbank), with him as its principal shareholder. He would go on to establish the Kyiv Institute of Banking in 1997 and served as its permanent rector for 14 years.\nLater in his life, Professor Matvienko holds honorary membership in the Ukrainian Academy of Architecture, Ukrainian Academy of Economic Cybernetics, Ukrainian Environmental Academy of Sciences, full membership in the Ukrainian Academy of Engineering Sciences, and academician status in the Academy of Economic Sciences. \n\n\n== Books ==\nMatvienko is a writer of many books on philosophy, banking, economics, poems and songs, including:\n\nState and Banks (1996)\nAutograph on the hryvnia (2000)\nReflections of the banker (2002)\nProminvestbank: Reproduction Strategy (2002)\nDesired and Real (2003)\nPhilosophical and Economic Views (2003)\nFrom the point of view of the world (2020)\nI love my Ukraine (1997)\nOn my native expanses (1999)\nSong of my star (2001)\nSouls of my excitement (2001)\nOberem of memory (2001)\nWitty words (2000; 2005)\nMy village (2004)\n\n\n== Philanthropy ==\nMatvienko is also a philanthropist who promotes education, art, and culture both domestically and overseas. As the chairman of the board of Prominvestbank, he was a prominent member of the public, the bank provided charity support to war veterans, disabled individuals, and underprivileged children from 1992 to 2008. He provided financial assistance to several medical research centres. He contributed to the restoration of the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra, St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery and many other.\nWith particular focus on bringing his hometown of Bilka back to life, Matvienko has been in charge of the construction of a number of infrastructure, such as a House of Culture that houses the village's heritage museum, a clinic, a school named after him, housing complexes, a Youth Stage complex, a coffeehouse, and cottages. He also led the telephoneization program in Korosten and the neighboring villages in the Korosten Raion. The Maidan Volodymyr Pavlovich Matvienko was the name given to the village's square in 2012 by the council of Bilka.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMatvienko is the son of Pavlo Oleksiyovych and Lukia Levkivna. He is married to Halyna Pylypivna (born 1941); and together they have a daughter Irina (born 1961) and a son Pavlo (born 1973), who became an economist and head of the All-Ukrainian Union \"Democrats\".\nFokus magazine ranked Matvienko as the 21st richest Ukrainian in February 2008; the publication estimated his net worth at $1.015 billion in 2023, pointing out that it was $995 million a year before. After a few months, he was ranked 20th out of all domestic wealthy persons by Korrespondent. The magazine said that he and his son Pavlo run the National Credit Bank in alongside Prominvestbank. The magazine states that the chairman of the board's total assets were $1.43 billion; during the year, these assets did not rise but rather fell by $520 million. \n\n\n== Awards and recognitions ==\nThe minor planet was named 6622 Matvienko, according to the official certificate of the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory. One of the first banknotes of independent Ukraine has his signature. President Leonid Kuchma awarded him the title of Hero of Ukraine Order of the State in 2004, in recognition of his exceptional personal contributions to Ukraine in the development of the banking system, as well as several years of selfless effort and public service.\nHe has received awards and recognitions such as:\n\n Hero of Ukraine Order of the State (20 October 2004)\n Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise Fourth Class (30 August 2002)\n Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise Fifth Class (25 December 1997)\n Honorary Award of the President of Ukraine (22 August 1996)\n Order of Friendship of Peoples (1986)\n Jubilee Medal \"In Commemoration of the 100th Anniversary of the Birth of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin\" (1970)\n Medal \"In Commemoration of the 1500th Anniversary of Kiev\" (1982)\nHonored Art Worker of Ukraine (21 August 1999)\nHonorary Award of the Ministry of Culture and Arts of Ukraine (2004)\nDiploma of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine (2003)\nDiploma of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine (July 2004)\nDiploma of the Presidium of the Verkhovna Rada of the Ukrainian SSR (1988)\nInternational Biographical Centre Man of the Year 1998–1999\nHonorary Professor of the International University Vienna\nHonorary Member of the Board of Directors of the American Biographical Institute\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Jahon Obidova (Uzbek Cyrillic: Жаҳон Обидова, Russian: Джахон Абидова, romanized Dzhakhon Abidova; 1900 – March 1966) was a key figure in the Communist Party of the Uzbek SSR in the Hujum era, becoming the deputy chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Uzbekistan SSR.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nObidova was born in 1900 to an impoverished Tajik family. At the age of eleven (or twelve or thirteen according to other sources), she was sold to a wealthy man (Inagamdzhan Irmatov) to be his fourth wife to pay a fifteen-ruble debt of her father. He abused her, but after the revolution she left him and began going to school, initially working as a domestic servant, became a member of the Komsomol, and graduated in 1921. In 1927 she became a member of the Communist Party. She retired in 1961 as a personal pensioner and died in March 1966. She was awarded two Order of the Red Banner of Labour and the Order of the Badge of Honour.\n\n\n== Political work ==\nObidova was very active in politics of the Uzbek SSR in the 1920s and 30s, working in the zhenotdel as part of the campaign promoting the liberation of women and involvement of women in the Communist Party, in what became known as the hujum years.In 1921 she became a political instructor in the women's department of the Koshchi union in Tashkent. She was one of the first women in the region to remove her veil, having done it in 1923, and encouraged other women to stop wearing the burqa. In 1929 she was elected deputy chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Uzbekistan SSR, in 1934 she became the chairman of the Tashkent City Council, and from 1935 to 1938 she served as the representative in Moscow of the government of the Uzbek SSR.\nWhile it is unclear where Obidova was after being removed from her post in 1938 during the Great Purge, and although her pictures were removed from official publications and she was mentioned in the third Moscow Show Trial of 1938, she was not repressed for very long, as she was sent to work in agriculture management after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 and became the leader of various agricultural enterprises over the years.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTojikhon Shodieva\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Further reading ===\nKamp, Marianne (2011).

        "content": "The Dalmatian people (Italian: Dalmata [dalˈmaːta]) (Dalmatian: Dalmata/Dalmati [ˈdalmatɑ], [ˈdalmati]) (Croatian: Dalmatinac [dalmǎtǐnat͡s]) are an extinct Latin romance ethnic group that were native to the Dalmatia region in Croatia\n\nThe Dalmatian people, also known as the Dalmati, were an ethnic group inhabiting the region of Dalmatia, situated along the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea. With roots tracing back to the illyro-romans  and later influenced by Ottoman, Byzantine, and Slavic cultures, the Dalmatian people developed a distinct identity characterized by their language, customs, and traditions.\nThe decline and eventual extinction of the Dalmatian people can be attributed to a complex interplay of historical events, including invasions, migrations, and cultural assimilation. Following the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD, Dalmatia experienced successive waves of conquests by various powers, including the Ostrogoths, Byzantines, Venetians, and Ottomans. These turbulent periods led to demographic shifts, displacement of populations, and the erosion of Dalmatian cultural distinctiveness.\nOne of the key factors contributing to the decline of the Dalmatian people was the gradual assimilation into surrounding ethnic groups, particularly the Croats and Italians, who exerted cultural and linguistic influence over the region. Over time, the Dalmatian language, once spoken by the Dalmati, became marginalized and eventually extinct, with the last known native speaker Tuone Udaina dying in the 19th century.\nToday, remnants of Dalmatian culture and heritage can be found in archaeological sites, historical records, and cultural traditions preserved by descendants of the region's ethnic groups.\nthey potentially belonged to the R1b Haplogroup\n\n\n== Antiquity ==\n\n\n=== Classical antiquity ===\n\nThe Dalmatian people, recognised as a Latin ethnic group, can be traced back to the height of the Roman Empire. Following the Roman conquest in 168BC  the establishment of the Diocese of illyria in 27BC, Later Dalmatia in 19BC\nAfter the Roman conquest, Dalmatia became an integral part of the empire, experiencing significant cultural, linguistic, and administrative influence. The mingling between the indigenous Illyrian customs with Roman practices gave rise to an Illyro-Roman culture, which gradually evolved into the unique identity of the Dalmatian people and other local Latin identities.\nThe establishment of urban centers such as Salona (modern-day Solin) and Diocletian's Palace in Split served as hubs of cultural exchange and economic activity, shaping the cultural landscape of Dalmatia. Latin became the dominant language, facilitating communication and trade among the population of the region.\nAs the Roman Empire declined, Dalmatia faced various challenges, including invasions and migrations. Despite these upheavals, the Dalmatian culture remained, maintaining their cultural heritage amidst changing political landscapes.\n\n\n== Medieval ==\n\n\n=== Early Medieval ===\n\nAround the mid-6th century AD, the waves of Slavic migrations began to sweep through the Balkan Peninsula, including the region of Dalmatia. This period marked a significant turning point in the history of the area, as the influx of Slavic tribes introduced new languages, customs, and social structures to the region. The Dalmatian people, until now shaped by Roman and Illyrian influences, now found themselves amidst a dynamic cultural environment, as they interacted and intermingled with the incoming Slavic populations.\nBy the 8th century AD, the political landscape of Europe underwent major changes with the rise of the Frankish Empire under the leadership of Charlemagne. Eager to expand his realm and assert his authority over the Adriatic coast, Charlemagne launched military campaigns into Dalmatia, eventually bringing the region under Frankish control. This period of Frankish domination marked a significant chapter in Dalmatian history, as the region became integrated into the broader political and cultural sphere of the Frankish Empire.\nHowever, the Frankish hegemony over Dalmatia proved to be short-lived, as the Byzantine Empire, centered in Constantinople, sought to reassert its influence in the region. In the early 9th century AD, Byzantine diplomats signed the Pax Nicephori culminating in the establishment of the Theme of Dalmatia, a Byzantine administrative division encompassing the coastal regions of Dalmatia.\nThe Byzantine reconquest of Dalmatia ushered in a new era of political and cultural dynamics in the region. With Byzantine rule came a resurgence of Hellenic influence, as Greek language, law, and administration supplanted Frankish institutions. Concurrently, the Slavic presence in Dalmatia continued to grow. Consequently the Dalmatian culture had large influence from both Slavic and Hellenic culture\n\n\n=== Late Medieval ===\n\n\n== Victorian ==\n\n\n== References ==",

The NSGP is one of eight DHS grant programs that assists states and localities prepare for terrorist attacks. The NSGP is funded through two subgrants: the State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP), allocated to non-profit organizations, and the Urban Area\nSecurity Initiative (UASI), allocated specifically to non-profit organizations within high-risk and high-threat cities.\nTo qualify for funding, organizations pass through review boards at the state level, then undergo a review at the national level that determines the actual amount of aid. Groups use the funding for measures such as blast-proof windows, reinforced doors, locks, gates, video surveillance, security training, awareness campaigns, and response planning.\n\n\n== History ==\nSince 1996, the U.S. Congress has provided grant funding to states and localities to prepare for terrorist attacks and improve domestic security. The idea for the NSGP was first proposed by the Jewish Federations of North America (JFNA) on December 11, 2001.\nThe NSGP was created by legislation enacted in 2004 and began distributing its first grants in 2005 as a security initiative under the umbrella of the larger two-year-old Urban Areas Security Initiative.\n\n\n=== Funding history ===\nFor its first year, Congress funded the program at slightly less than $25 million annually. Legislators and advocacy groups have called for an increase in funding to cover all eligible applicants, especially after terror plots such as the 2009 Bronx terrorism plot, the Colleyville synagogue hostage crisis, and the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.\nFunding increased significantly in the 2020s to meet increasing demand as antisemitism increased in the United States. Despite funding increases, the program fulfilled just over half of total grant applications, with total grant requests reaching $447 million.\nSince 2019, legislators and groups such as the Orthodox Union and Jewish Federations of North America called for $360 million in annual funding. The New Lines Institute also recommended funding the program at this level in a 2022 analysis.\nAmid a surge of antisemitism during the Israel-Hamas war, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called for the program's annual funding to be tripled to $1 billion for 2024. The funding would increase staff at FEMA to accelerate the rate at which grants were administered and to satisfy the 58% of applications, representing $679 million in funding, that were not approved.\n\n\n=== Recipients ===\nBetween 2011 and 2021, faith-based awardees received approximately 97% of all NSGP funds, and secular awardees have received approximately 3% of all funds. Secular awardees include medical institutions and higher education institutions.\nJewish groups and institutions have received most of the program's funding since its establishment in 2005 due to higher levels of Jewish participation in applications and because they were deemed at higher risk of potential terrorist attack based on threat and risk information, according to DHS information and the New Lines Institute. Jewish institutions received 60% of funding in 2009, 73% between 2007 and 2010, 81% in 2011, 97% in 2012, and almost 90% in 2013. By 2014, $110 million of the $138 million distributed through the program had gone to Jewish institutions seeking funding.\nIn an attempt to broaden access to the program, Jewish Federations of North America (JFNA) have held trainings to help other faith groups improve their grant applications, including hosting a joint webinar with the U.S. Council of Muslim Organizations (USCMO). JFNA and the Orthodox Union joined with the USCMO, the Sikh Council for Interfaith Relations, and several Christian denominations to call for increased funding to the program. The joint lobbying effort resulted in Congress appropriating twice the previous year's funding for 2021.\nAfter the Colleyville synagogue hostage crisis in 2022, Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker credited NSGP for boosting his synagogue's security measures, such as upgrading its camera system.\nThe program has become a popular topic among antisemitic and conspiracy-oriented bloggers, who point to information on award sizes to argue that Jewish interests have undue effect upon the American government.\n\n\n== State-level programs ==\nSeveral U.S. states have their own nonprofit security grant programs, including California, Connecticut, New Jersey, Maryland, Ohio, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania, New York, and Massachusetts.\n\n\n=== California ===\nAfter the Poway synagogue shooting, the California State Legislature passed AB 1548 to establish the California State Nonprofit Security Grant Program in 2019, awarding up to $200,000 per year to religious, political, and mission-based institutions. The state allocated $12 million to the program, administered by the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services, in 2019. Security grants had previously been a line item in the state budget since 2015.\n\n\n=== Connecticut ===\nIn February 2021, Governor Ned Lamont announced $3.8 million in grants for 97 nonprofits, with a maximum of $50,000 per site, as part of the state's newly established Nonprofit Security Grant Program. In 2024, the program announced up to $5 million in annual grants.\n\n\n=== Florida ===\nCiting tensions due to the Israel-Hamas war, Governor Ron DeSantis signed HB 7-C in November 2023 to allocate $25 million in Security Grants to Jewish days schools and pre-schools. An additional $20 million will be given to the Florida Division of Emergency Management to establish a nonprofit security grant program for organizations at high risk of violent attacks or hate crimes.\n\n\n=== Pennsylvania ===\nAfter the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting in 2018, Pennsylvania passed Act 83 of 2019 to establish the state's Nonprofit Security Grant Fund. Initially, $5 million in grant funding was available. After an increase in antisemitism during the Israel-Hamas war in 2023, the state legislature increased the available funding to $10 million. In the 5 years since its inception, the fund distributed $25 million to synagogues, mosques, and other nonprofit organizations.\n\n\n== Outside the United States ==\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nSince 2015, the United Kingdom has allocated £122 million through the Jewish Community Protective Security Grant to enhance security efforts such as security guards, CCTV, and alarm systems, at Jewish schools and synagogues, including £15 million in funding for 2023–24.\nThe UK government also allocated £24.5 million in 2022 for the Places of Worship Protective Security Funding Scheme for mosques and associated faith community centers.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSecure Community Network, Jewish security organization in North America\nList of attacks on Jewish institutions\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "After Davao Force was dispersed on December 24, 1941, they went missing and no contact, General Joseph Vachon sent Lieutenant Colonel Howard Frissell to Digos, Davao and setup defense of Digos Junction area to prevent Japanese drive towards Digos-Pikit road and reaching Kabacan the southern terminus of Sayre Highway.\nThe Digos Force of Cotabato-Davao Sector held the Japanese for four months despite lack artillery guns and ammunition. The landing of one of the group of Sakaguchi detachment in Cotabato City and made a landing head to Pikit and Midsayap through the Mindanao River on April 28, 1942, made 101st Division commander General Vachon to order Digos Force to retreat towards Kabacan in fear of being cut off as Japanese are now fighting at the vicinity of Kabacan.\n\n\n== Background ==\nWhen Davao City, Davao was Japanese secured on December 24, 1941, at a great cost due to heavy casualties inflicted by the Davao Force under Lieutenant Colonel Roger Hilsman, Sakaguchi detachment under Major General Sakaguchi Kayatake was forced to use his reserves intended for Jolo, Sulu Invasion. He landed his troops in Malalag, Davao southeast of Davao Gulf. General Joseph Vachon, Commanding General of 101st Infantry Division, Philippine Commonwealth Army ordered Lieutenant Colonel Howard Frissell to setup defense in Digos area and locate the missing forces of Colonel Hilsman.\nJapanese moved west to Padada, Davao where the setup their supply depot where they can attack Digos. Another landing was made by the Japanese along the shoreline from Padada to Digos.\n\n\n=== Defending force ===\nHe has 3rd Battalion 101st Infantry and 3rd Battalion 102nd Infantry. On December 31, 1941, a detachment of three QF 2.95inch Mountain Guns under Captain Manuel Acosta of Philippine Army was arrived to support the force, which gave a little morale booster to the defending force. 3rd Battalion 101st Infantry under Major Arlie Higgins was posted at the south of Digos and 3rd Battalion 102nd Infantry under Captain Johnson posted in the north toward Davao.\n\n\n=== Japanese force ===\nMuira detachment was secluded in Davao City maintaining garrison duty. It did not moved towards Digos only on February when battalions from 10th Independent Garrison arrived to replaced them on garrison duty. 2nd Kure Special Landing Force was freed from Legaspi, Albay and landed in Malalag, Davao to free Sakaguchi detachment and moved to Jolo, Sulu.\n\n\n== Combat narratives ==\nMarines from 2nd Kure SNLF landed in the shoreline from Digos to Padada on December 31, 1941. With artillery, tanks, and air support it easily secured a beachhead and made contact on 3rd Battalion 101st which took heaviest pressure. Captain Johnson and his 3rd Battalion 102nd Infantry was ordered to assist the right flank. Captain Johnson was wounded and Captain Acosta commander of Artillery detachment was killed. The Digos-Pikit Junction was lost on this action. A reserve 3rd PC Infantry battalion at center was held it for a while but fled as towards Pikit. Captain Floyd Forte a Visayas-Mindanao Force HQ staff rallied to held the line near the Haley Plantation.\nOn January 18, 1942, Colonel Howard Frissell was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Howard Perry with Major John H. McGee as his executive officer in Digos Sector. 3rd PC Infantry Regiment was replaced by 1/101st Infantry and 1/101st Field Artillery. 101st Special Troops was also attached to the sector to make raids on Japanese positions. First raid in Padada was successful and several warehouses were burned and Japanese supplies were destroyed. However, raiding team commander Captain Nicolas Del Rosario was killed on his wounds.\nIn March Lieutenant Colonel Howard Perry was replaced by his XO Major John H. McGee as he was ordered to be in Mindanao Force HQ in Malaybalay and assumed as Force Personnel Officer G1. McGee was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and 3rd Battalion 101st Infantry was replaced by 1st Battalion 101st Field Artillery (equipped as infantry) under Major Reed Graves. 3rd Battalion 101st Infantry was fighting in the sector for three months since January 1942. 2nd Battalion 101st Infantry was again retrofit and attached to this again under its commander Major John Richardson.\nIn April Lieutenant Colonel John H. McGee was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Reed Graves, commander of 101st Field Artillery Regiment. 101st Infantry Regiment units are pulled out to Kabacan and Aroman area in Carmen Ferry Sector. Muira receiving reinforcements took and offensive campaign in coordination with Kawaguchi detachment who just landed in Cotabato City and Parang. Graves forces repulsed Muira assaults twice with mortals and machineguns. However, due to Kawaguchi was able to make a landing head in Midsayap through Mindanao River, General Vachon ordered Graves to retreat towards Kabacan in fear of being cut off. Thus, the operations in Digos sector ended as operations are now concentrated in Kabacan and Carmen sector.\n\n\n=== Surrender of Mindanao force ===\n101st Infantry Division was still fighting when order from Mindanao Force headquarters reached Division headquarters to surrender at daybreak on May 12, 1942. Digos was the longest campaign in Mindanao during World War II as it reached four months before it was evacuated by 101st Division troops.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== See also ===\nJapanese invasion of Davao\n101st Infantry Division\n101st Infantry Regiment\n102nd Infantry Regiment\n103rd Infantry Regiment\n101st Field Artillery Regiment\nVisayas-Mindanao Force\n\n\n=== External links ===\nThere were others, Unpublished Papers of Colonel Hiram Tarkington\nRice and Salt, John H.

        "content": "The Tatra marmot (Marmota marmota latirostris) is an endemic subspecies of marmot found in the Tatra Mountains. In the past, it was a game animal, but in the 19th century, its population drastically declined. It is a herbivore active in the summer, living in territorial family clans in the mountains from the upper montane to the alpine zone. It is one of the rarest vertebrates in Poland and is subject to strict legal protection. It is also legally protected in Slovakia. The Red List of Threatened Animals in Poland and the Polish Red Book of Animals classify the Tatra marmot as a strongly endangered subspecies (EN), while the Red List for the Carpathians in Poland designates it as \"CR\" – critically endangered. It is a relatively poorly researched animal.\n\n\n== History of discovery and research ==\n\nThe wider recognition of the marmot in Poland was influenced by the slow progress of settlement in the Tatra region, dating back to the privilege granted by Bolesław V the Chaste in 1255 to the Cistercian Abbey of Szczyrzyc: \"We also grant to the abbot: free hunting, all in the surrounding forests up to the mountains called Tatras.\" Historical accounts mention that over time, a group of hunters specializing in marmot hunting emerged, known as \"whistlers\".\nDescriptions of Tatra marmots were very modest and mostly related to their hunting value. Hungarian pastor Andreas Jonas Czirbesz wrote in 1774: \"The Carpathian marmot resides in the highest mountain peaks' dens in summer and winter. It feeds on roots and herbs and has fat, tasty meat.\" The meat, skins, and especially the fat, which had wide applications in folk medicine, were valued.\nVarious authors wrote about marmots; in 1719, teacher Georg Buchholtz, in 1721, Polish naturalist and Jesuit Gabriel Rzączyński, in 1750, Gdańsk naturalist Jacob Theodor Klein, and in 1779, Polish naturalist and clergyman Jan Krzysztof Kluk mentioned \"whistlers\" in the Carpathians. Marmots were hunted almost without restrictions until around 1868, and on the Hungarian side of the Tatras until 1883 when regulations protecting this species were introduced.\nIn 1865, the first description of marmot biology was published. The author of the work About the Marmot was Maksymilian Nowicki – co-founder of the Tatra Society, researcher of Tatra fauna and flora, and a pioneer of nature conservation in Poland. Nowicki, using the name Arctomys (Greek: ἄρκτος, romanized: arktos – bear, and Latin: mus – mouse, rat) as the generic name for marmots, used the term \"little bear mouse,\" while Ludwik Zejszner, writing at the same time, used the term \"bear mouse\": \"this peculiar little animal looks like it consists of two others; with a head similar to a mouse, and the rest of the body like a bear, covered with long hair similar to martens. Highlanders call it a marmot because of its special barking, as the individual barking sounds are so drawn out that they bear a great resemblance to whistling... The marmot makes very long burrows in the Tatra hollows, lining them with moss, grass, and, like many animals, undergoes hibernation. At the end of summer, it stores numerous root supplies in its burrows and, having fattened up excessively, falls asleep in this winter abode, only waking up completely emaciated with spring\".\n\n\n== Systematics and evolution ==\nBelonging to the family Sciuridae, the species Marmota marmota began to inhabit European territories already in the Pleistocene. It occurred over a vast area – from present-day Belgium and the shores of the English Channel to the Pannonian Basin. In the Holocene, with the warming climate, marmots had to choose more favorable locations. The moderate warmth of forested areas was not suitable for them, as their bodies are not well adapted to higher temperatures. They found cooler habitats in the elevated mountain ranges of Europe. Over time, they had to narrow their territories to the Alpine range and the Tatra Mountains. The separation of the Alpine population from the Carpathian one could have occurred 15–50 thousand years ago, but for many years, no differences were noticed between the marmot living in the Tatras and its Alpine cousin, and both populations were treated as geographically separated locations of the same species.\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, Czechoslovak scientists undertook comparative studies. For this purpose, on 31 May 1961, a marmot was shot from a colony in Wielki Żleb Krywański. The holotype studies were conducted by Josef Kratochvíl, a zoologist from the agricultural university in Brno, who found significant differences in the structure of the nasal bones compared to representatives of Alpine populations. After conducting additional comparisons of the results of cranial measurements of the skulls of 10 Tatra marmots (selected from 16 obtained for study) and 40 marmots from the Alps (27 skulls were personally examined, and the measurement data of 13 were the result of Gerrit Miller's work from 1912), Kratochvíl concluded that there was a regularity in the comparative group, namely, that the anterior, facial part of the nasal bone was significantly wider and longer in Tatra marmots than in animals from the Alps. Additionally, he found that marmots living in the Tatras are smaller than their cousins and have slightly different fur coloration. Ultimately, Kratochvíl classified marmots from the Tatras as a separate subspecies, M. marmota latirostris, while marmots from the Alpine population were designated as M. marmota marmota. Some zoologists question whether the observed differences could be merely manifestations of individual variability within the small population. However, genetic studies have not yet been conducted to settle this matter.\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe generic name Marmota may derive from Gallo-Romance languages, meaning \"murmuring\" or \"purring\", or from Latin, being associated with the term mus montanus, which translates to \"mountain mouse\". The subspecies epithet latirostris originates from two Latin words: the element lati– comes from Latin lātus, meaning \"wide\", and –rostris from Latin rōstrum, referring to the nose or beak, and together it can be translated as \"broad-nosed\". The epithet refers to the flattened and wider facial part of the nasal bone (os nasale) of the animal compared to representatives of the Alpine population.\n\n\n== Morphology ==\nThe Tatra marmot is one of the largest rodents in Europe. It is similar in size to a domestic cat, with a massive torso. Its length, including the head, ranges from 45 cm to 65 cm (although another source by the same author provides a range of 40–60 cm). In spring, the body mass of adult males ranges from 2.7 to 3.4 kg, while females weigh between 2.5 and 3.0 kg. During the season from spring to autumn, marmots start to consume more calories, taking in more carbohydrates from grass seeds, and their brown adipose tissue significantly expands, creating an energy reserve for the next hibernation period. Consequently, the body mass of marmots begins to increase noticeably during this period and can reach over 6 kg by autumn, with over 2 kg attributed to fat tissue. The fluffy tail measures between 13 and 17 cm.\nThe primary fur consists of long, strong, and thick guard hairs, with the down hair being dense, composed of shorter, woolly, and slightly twisted hairs. The fur color is described as reddish-brown transitioning to dark brown-black. The hair coloration is highly varied, with black or dark brown dominating at the base, while shades of fawn, black, or reddish prevail higher up, fading to fawn or beige at the ends. The fur on the abdomen is lighter, ranging from light beige to yellowish. The head is covered with shorter hair, usually dark, black, or gray, with a light patch between the eyes. The muzzle is lighter, with a grayish tone, while the tail is blackish-brown, with a black tip. The fur of young individuals under 1 year old is notably darker and fluffier. Moulting typically occurs once a year, around June. Females, weakened by nursing new offspring, may have incomplete fur, and moulting may be delayed by about four weeks. As they age, the fur becomes more twisted and bushy. Older marmots, especially after hibernation, may have areas of thinning fur on their backs and tails.\n\nFive rows of whiskers, measuring up to 8 cm in length, grow on the sides of the marmot's muzzle, with sensory hairs also distributed on the eyebrows. Marmots do not have sweat glands. The forehead is flat and wide, with short (2–2.5 cm), densely furred ears almost entirely concealed in the head's fur. The eyes are small and black. The front paws are short, robust, and dexterous, equipped with four hairy toes ending in claws measuring 2–2.5 cm, which serve as useful tools for digging burrows and holding food. The muscular hind limbs end in five toes with sharp claws.\nThe external surface of the incisors is covered with hard enamel with longitudinal grooves, whose color changes with the animal's age, starting white in juveniles and darkening to orange and nearly brown with age. The posterior, concave surface of the incisors is made up of brittle dentin. The incisor's occlusal arrangement is scissor-like. The dentition for marmots is: \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              1023\n              1013\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {1023}{1013}}}\n  \n.\n\nIn females, there are five pairs of mammary glands.\n\tGallery of sample fur coloration of Tatra marmots\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Morphological in comparison to the alpine marmot ===\nThe main feature that allowed the Tatra subspecies of marmot to be distinguished was the dimensions of the facial part of the nasal bone:\n\n\n==== Craniological comparisons (Josef Kratochvíl, 1961) ====\n\nFurthermore, Tatra marmots are characterized by lighter fur and have a grayish-brown coloration, while the alpine subspecies has a darker brown coloration, often with a reddish hue. M. marmota latirostris has a smaller body mass. However, sources do not provide details of this difference.\nDespite differences in the habitats of both subspecies (alpine marmots occupy locations at altitudes up to 3200 m above sea level), no differences have been observed in behavior and way of life.\n\n\n== Lifestyle ==\nThe Tatra marmot is a diurnal animal with territorial and social behavior. It is monogamous, and individual families join colonies, with the nucleus typically being a dominant pair of animals.\n\n\n=== Annual life cycle ===\nThe annual life cycle of the marmot consists of two periods: summer activity and hibernation.\n\n\n==== Summer activity ====\n\nThe summer activity of the marmot begins around April and May and lasts until the second half of September or the first half of October. The earliest emergence of marmots on the surface has been observed on April 22, while the latest on May 10. This period lasts 139–158 days (or 139–161), with an average of 148 (or 150.7).\nThe first spring activity after awakening from winter hibernation is associated with the mating season. the estrous cycle typically occurs in the second decade of May. Mating takes place both inside and outside the burrow. Gestation lasts about 33 days, and the young are born in the second decade of June. Usually, from 1 to 6 offspring are born, most commonly from 2 to 3. They remain under the care of the female in the burrow until the second half of July. They start consuming solid food at the age of 8 weeks. They will only become independent after 3–4 years when they reach sexual maturity.\nThe beginning of summer activity is also marked by the search for new locations. Marmots migrate up to a distance of 3000 meters.\nDuring the summer period, marmots spend their time foraging (43.9%) and patrolling the territory (40.3%). Other activities such as moving, gathering winter supplies, digging and tidying burrows, playing, hygiene, typically account for only 8.9% of their time. Spending time inside the burrow during the day constitutes an average of 6.9%.\nThere are three different types of contacts between marmots. The locomotor contact is the most common, followed by acoustic and visual contact.\n\n\n==== Hibernation ====\nAt the end of September and beginning of October, the period of summer activity ends for the Tatra marmot, and the hibernation period begins. Changes in the environment signal the marmot's organism. The air temperature drops, the days become shorter, and the vegetation, which serves as food, becomes scarce. Marmots curl up into a ball and collectively arrange themselves at the bottom of the winter burrow chamber. Metabolic processes slow down, allowing the body temperature to decrease from 37.7 °C to 8–10 °C, which is about 2–3 °C lower than the temperature inside the burrow. In exceptional situations, the body temperature may drop to 3–5 °C. Respiratory rate decreases from 16 to as low as 2–3 (or 4–5) breaths per minute, as oxygen consumption during hibernation decreases by about thirty times, and the heart rate decreases from 220 to 30 contractions per minute. Other sources specify the frequency of heart ventricular contractions in the summer period as 130, decreasing during hibernation to 15 per minute.\nYoung marmots usually hibernate in the middle of the family, enveloped by older individuals, which helps them survive the burden of winter sleep more easily. Adult marmots accumulate more fat for this period. They also maintain a slightly higher body temperature.\nDuring hibernation, the marmot wakes up approximately every 3 weeks. The awakening lasts for about 12–30 hours, after which the animal returns to sleep. The trigger for awakening may be a decrease in the temperature inside the burrow to 0 °C. Too many awakenings during hibernation are very energetically costly for the marmot's organism. During these short awakenings, the marmot's body temperature rises to about 34 °C, sharply increasing energy expenditure, and up to 90% of the reserves accumulated in the form of brown adipose tissue are consumed. In the case of prolonged winter, the organism may become excessively depleted, leading to the death of the animal. During hibernation, the marmot's body mass significantly decreases. Hibernation lasts for 201–227 days, 215 on average.\n\n\n=== Social structure ===\n\nFamily colony can consist of several individuals – the dominant pair, their offspring from different years, and adopted individuals. According to former director of Tatra National Park, Wojciech Gąsienica-Byrcyn, several marmot families can comprise a colony. Marmot territorialism manifests in the daily need for the dominant male to patrol the boundaries demonstratively, systematically marking the territory with its scent. This is most likely done through secretions from glands located in the anal region, cheek glands, and glands in the paw pads. The marked territory is defended by the male against individuals from neighboring colonies. The first warnings are visual signals. The male raises its fur and waves its tail vertically. If the warning is not enough, it leads to a fight, where decisive wounds are inflicted using incisors. If the fight is evenly matched and neither male surrenders or flees, the brawl can last even the whole day. Aggressive defense is mainly directed towards foreign adult males. Young individuals can visit even the center of a foreign colony without fear. They are seen as adoption candidates for the colony without posing a threat to the dominant male's position.\nThe social nature of marmot colonies is evident in their collective actions. They build burrows together, sleep together, and help each other groom. Young ones play together in groups, wrestling, standing in a \"pillar\" position, or chasing each other around the colony area. During a meeting, marmots greet each other by touching noses and sniffing. Sometimes, they also show excitement by moving their tails up and down. Reproduction is also subject to specific rules and is reserved only for the dominant pair. Mature individuals in the colony must adhere to the leader in this regard. Periodic battles for leadership may result in the overthrow of the dominant male. He is then expelled from the colony, and the victor may sometimes kill his offspring to solidify his power.\n\n\n=== Sounds ===\n\nMarmots also communicate with each other using whistles or rather screams, as the sound emanates from their wide-open mouths. Its primary function is to warn colony members of danger. Several different levels of alarm whistles can be distinguished. The presence of a human, dog, or fox is signaled by a series of moderately intense whistles – then marmots swiftly move to the nearest burrow and observe from its entrance how events unfold. The series of whistles usually also discourages a fox, who is aware that after hearing the alarm signals, no marmot will become its prey. The greatest threat, such as the appearance of an eagle, is signaled by a single sharp whistle. Then, marmots flee without hesitation and hide in their burrows.\nMarmots also emit other sounds, which can be described as squeaks or murmurs. These do not convey warning information.\n\n\n== Geographical distribution ==\nThe range of the Marmota marmota species spans between 44° and 49° N. Natural populations have survived in two mountain ranges: the Alps and the Tatra Mountains. The Tatra Mountains represent the northern range of the species (49° 14\" N). The Alps are inhabited by the subspecies Marmota marmota marmota, while Marmota marmota latirostris is an endemic species living in Poland and Slovakia. The vertical distribution range of Tatra marmots' habitats ranges from 1380 to 2050 meters above sea level, or according to other sources: in the Polish Tatra Mountains from 1750 to 1950 meters above sea level (with an average of 1870 meters above sea level), and in the entire Tatras massif from 1380 to 2330 meters above sea level.\nIn the main Tatra range, 207 main burrows were inventoried, and in the Low Tatras, 46 burrows were counted, or according to other sources, 40 burrows. The population of Tatra marmots on the Polish side of the Tatras was estimated at 150–200 individuals, while the total population in the entire Tatras is less than 1000 individuals.\nThe issue of precisely determining the locations of M. marmota latirostris in the Tatra Mountains encounters certain difficulties. While it is easy to establish that the autochthonous subspecies of the Tatra marmot occurs in the Western and Eastern Tatras, the origin of the marmots occurring in the Slovakian Low Tatras (with the highest peak being Ďumbier) separated from the main massif of the Tatras by the Liptov Basin is not clear. Although Ludwik Zejszner claimed that marmots were already living in the area of Solisko and Ďumbier in 1845, some researchers believe that the population in the Low Tatras is introduced from other parts of the Tatras. The fact of the 19th-century introduction in the area of Kráľova hoľa in the eastern part of the Low Tatras is reported by many researchers. Some even specify a specific time frame for it, around 1859–1867. Others believe that the marmots from the western part of the Low Tatras constitute a post-glacial population because, in their opinion, marmots would not be able to penetrate through the forested areas of the central part of the Low Tatras from previous introductions. In 1961, an expert on Tatra fauna, zoologist from the research station of the national park, Milič Blahout, wrote directly about the introduction of marmots from the Austrian Alps released in the Low Tatras between 1859 and 1867. Barbara Chovancová, who leads the marmot and chamois protection program in the Slovak Tatra National Park (TANAP), has no doubts that introductions were carried out twice in the Ďumbier area of the Low Tatras. Alpine marmots were released there in 1859, and in 1867, two pairs of marmots from the High Tatras were also released. If this were indeed the case, hybridization between representatives of both marmot subspecies could have occurred. Slovak authors mention a possible gene exchange between populations from the western and eastern parts of the Low Tatras. However, most believe that only Marmota marmota latirostris inhabits the Low Tatras. Kratochvíl proposed a hypothesis regarding the potential historical introduction confusion. He pointed out that historical information about marmots in the Carpathians could refer to populations still living in the 19th century in the Carpathians in Romania and Ukrainian Zakarpattia. However, there is a lack of reliable cranial or genetic studies that would resolve the issue of the origin of the populations in the Slovak Low Tatras.\nData about historical locations of marmots in the Tatra Mountains was derived from extensive local nomenclature referring to marmot habitats: Svišťový štít, Svišťová dolina, Svišťovský potok, Świstówka Roztocka, Świstówka Waksmundzka, Malá Svišťovka, Veľká Svišťovka, Svišťové sedlo, Świstowa Grań with Svišťové veže included, Świstowa Rówień, Svišťové plieska, Svišťový roh, Svišťová kôpka, Svišťový priechod, Svišťový chrbát, Sedlo pod Svišťovkou, Svišťovka, Nižná svišťová jaskyňa, Vyšná svišťová jaskyňa. These names appear in literature only in the 17th century, but Gabriel Rzączyński already in 1721 mentioned, \"is found in the Alps and Carpathian mountains in a valley named Świszcza\" (probably referring to Svišťová dolina).\nIn the last decade, a small number of marmots from the population in the Slovak Tatras were introduced into the Ukrainian part of the Eastern Carpathians.\n\n\n=== Fossil traces of occurrence ===\nFossil traces of marmot occurrence have been found in Moravia, and in Poland in the vicinity of Jasło.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\nThe Tatra marmot is a herbivore. The main components of its diet include: herbaceous vegetation, shrubs and prostrate shrubs, roots, and tubers. The composition of its diet changes with the periods of vegetation in the Tatra Mountains. Favorite spring dishes include grasses, and in summer, the marmot most willingly eats spotted gentian, alpine woodrush, alpine coltsfoot, alpine avens, Mutellina purpurea, and Poa granitica. More than 40 species of consumed plants are mentioned; among them are alpine bartsia, wood cranesbill, Oreochloa disticha, European blueberry, Veratrum lobelianum, Campanula alpina, Campanula tatrae, Ranunculus pseudomontanus, large white buttercup, alpine hawkweed, brown clover, colorful fescue, Valeriana sambucifolia, Valeriana tripteris, Thymus alpestris, Thymus pulcherrimus, Adenostyles alliariae, dandelions, Solidago alpestris, Doronicum austriacum, Doronicum clusii, golden cinquefoil, Anthyllis alpestris, bistort, alpine bistort, golden root, alpine pasqueflower, alpine sainfoin, Juncus trifidus, Rumex alpestris, wavy hair-grass, eyebright, Soldanella carpatica, alpine meadow-grass, narcissus anemone and round-headed rampion. An adult marmot consumes about 1.5 kg of food daily. Water requirements are met by consuming juicy plants.\nThe Tatra marmot is vulnerable to attacks from predators such as the golden eagle, gray wolf, Eurasian lynx, and red fox. The mere presence of humans also causes pressure and changes in behavior. In relation to humans, the marmot maintains a safe escape distance of several dozen to several hundred meters. In relation to predators, this distance is significantly extended and can be several hundred meters.\n\n\n=== Habitat ===\n\nThe entire population of the Tatra marmot is located within the territory of the Slovak Tatra National Park (TANAP) and the Polish Tatra National Park, so the habitat has a primitive character.\nThe typical habitat of M. marmota latirostris consists of Tatran areas in the altitudinal zonation: alpine zone, subalpine zone (grassy fragments), mountain zone (open spaces), and to a limited extent, foothill zone, with an average annual temperature ranging from -3 to +3 °C. The marmot prefers sunny places. The slope angle of the mountain habitats does not exceed 40°. The marmot enjoys the surroundings of rocks, which provide a good observation point and can also serve as shelter for hiding. The soil must have sufficient thickness to allow the digging of a burrow.\nIn the Tatras, the upper limit of vertical distribution of habitats is determined by orographic conditions. Above 2300 m above sea level, the low thickness of the soil basically prevents the digging of burrows. The lowest recorded site was inventoried at an altitude of 1350 m above sea level.\nThe central part of the colony typically occupies an area of about 2.5 hectares. The surface area of the territory depends, of course, on the vegetation coverage and the size of the colony. However, most authors report much smaller surface areas occupied by the colony: Peter Bopp 2000–2500 m2, Josef Kratochvíl 7900 m2, Milíč Blahout 2500–3600 m2, Dymitr I. Bibikov 500–4500 m2. The maximum occupied area can reach 2–7 hectares.\n\n\n=== Burrow ===\n\nThe burrow is the most important habitat for the marmot. It spends the entire period of hibernation in it, and during the summer, the burrow provides shelter. Therefore, suitable soil conditions, which allow easy excavation of tunnels, largely determine the location of a given colony. Both the thickness of the soil and the arrangement of aquifers are important, as they influence the avoidance of flooding or inundation. The nesting chamber is lined with dried grasses from the local vegetation. The marmot utilizes Juncus trifidus, Oreochloa disticha, fescue, reed grass, moss and lichens. The gathered lining is not used by marmots as food. It has also been observed that marmots collect tissues or fabrics discarded by tourists for this purpose. Marmots maintain cleanliness of their burrows, so each burrow is equipped with a latrine, which is created in alcoves along the side tunnels. Only there does the marmot relieve itself. Similarly, local marmot latrines can also be found outside formal burrows. They are created temporarily on the family's territory, in short tunnels, or in depressions under rocks.\n\n\n==== Hibernation burrow ====\n\nThe hibernation burrow plays a crucial role in the life of these animals. A marmot family spends an average of 215 days per year in it, hence the term \"main burrow\". It can also serve as the center of a marmot's life. The winter burrow consists of an entire system of branching tunnels, which can have a total length of over 10 meters. The tunnels have an oval shape with a diameter of 15–18 cm and are relatively shallow, but below the frost line – typically 1.2 meters below ground level. The central chamber of the burrow is located even up to 7 meters deep, accessed by several tunnels allowing the use of distant entrances. The chamber is abundantly lined with hay collected by the animals. To prepare one bedroom for winter, these rodents can use up to 15 kg of grass. Near the entrances, there is usually an earth mound formed by the removal of material during tunneling. The tunnels are equipped with small widenings, which allow family members to pass each other going in opposite directions. Before winter, the entrances to the burrows are carefully sealed by the marmots from the inside with packed earth, stones, and feces.\nEach burrow houses a family hibernating, usually consisting of 4 to 10 marmots. In the past, accounts from hunters indicated that they found between 2 and 15 individuals dug out from a winter burrow.\n\n\n==== Summer burrow ====\nThe summer burrow, sometimes referred to as transitional, is a system of tunnels built for temporary use during the summer season. It is excavated more shallowly (does not need to protect from the cold of frozen ground) and has a shorter tunnel system. Sometimes, after summer, it may be deepened and used for hibernation. However, if a family uses the hibernation burrow in the summer, they do not build a separate summer burrow.\n\n\n==== Escape burrow ====\nThe most commonly encountered underground structure of the marmot is the escape burrow, also known as emergency or rescue burrow. These are makeshift shelters from predators. Their construction is very simple – sometimes their length does not exceed 1 meter, and they are equipped with only one or two entrances and do not have many branches. The marmot tries to cover its territory with a network of such makeshift shelters. Within the area of one colony, there can be found from 16 to 20 such hiding places, and when disturbed, the animal can remain underground for several hours. The marmot tries not to stray more than 10–15 meters from the nearest shelter. Over time, even escape burrows can be expanded and elevated to a higher status.\n\n\n== Tatra marmot in captivity ==\nTatra marmots are not currently bred in Polish zoos. Between 1924 and 1935, the zoo in Poznań possessed three individuals from the Polish population of M. marmota, while from 1927 onwards, the Kraków Bażantarnia (which was succeeded by the local zoo) bred four Tatra marmots. After World War II, individual specimens of this subspecies were exhibited in Czechoslovakian zoos.\n\n\n== Threats and conservation ==\n\n\n=== Legal conservation ===\n\n\n==== International law ====\nBern Convention – annex III\nHabitats Directive – annex II and IV\n\n\n==== National law ====\nSpecies protection in Poland – strict protection\n\n\n==== Threat categories ====\nRed List of Endangered and Threatened Animals in Poland – EN\nPolish Red Book of Animals – EN\nCarpathian List – EN (in Poland – CR)\nIUCN classification: Marmota marmota marmota is abundant, least concerning (LC). The subspecies Marmota marmota latirostris is rare and requires strict protection. Highly endangered in Poland due to a small population.\n\n\n=== Threats ===\n\nUntil the 19th century, regular hunting of marmots was conducted in the Tatra Mountains, where their skins, meat, and fat were highly sought-after commodities. There was a particularly high demand for marmot fat due to its use in traditional medicine and the widespread belief in its miraculous healing properties. Marmot fat was used both externally and internally for various purposes, including the treatment of hernias. It was also given with milk to women in labor to facilitate childbirth and as a strengthener. Additionally, it was believed to heal wounds, treat swollen glands (lymph nodes), and alleviate coughs. Towards the end of the 19th century, when Zakopane gained status of a spa town, many tuberculosis patients sought \"miraculous remedies\" in the form of marmot fat.\nMarmot skins were used to cover horse collars or sold as fur to urban residents. However, the highlanders in the Podhale region did not use them to make their own clothing. Freshly removed marmot skins were applied to painful areas for rheumatism. Marmot meat was also considered the best among all game meats.\nIn the second half of the 19th century, only refuges inaccessible to hunters remained. In 1881, only 30 individuals were inventoried on the Polish side of the Tatras, and by 1888, there were 35 individuals left.\n\nOn 5 October 1868, under pressure from members of the local history commission of the Kraków Scientific Society (Maksymilian Nowicki, Ludwik Zejszner, and Father Dr. Eugeniusz Janota), the Diet of Galicia and Lodomeria in Lviv adopted a law \"regarding the prohibition of capturing, exterminating, and selling alpine animals proper to the Tatras, marmots, and wild goats\". This was the world's first case of parliamentary enactment of a law protecting animal species. The situation of the Tatra marmot worsened again during World War I, leading to an increase in hunting. Since then, sheep grazing in marmot habitats has also begun. A significant improvement in the situation came with the establishment of the Tatra National Park in 1954, which encompasses all marmot locations in the Polish Tatras.\nThe main threats to M. marmota latirostris include pressure from predators and hunting. Changes in behavior are induced by excessive tourist and sports activity. Human presence also limits contacts between colonies (e.g., in the Kasprowy Wierch area), which are necessary for genetic exchange, and increases the risk of additional diseases, including parasites.\n\n\n=== Population ===\nSince the significant decline of marmots in the 19th century, their population has slowly been increasing. In 1881, there were 30 marmots in the Polish Tatras, in 1888 – 35, in 1928 and 1952 – 50, in 1982 between 108 and 132, and around 190 individuals in 2003. Altogether, on both sides of the Tatras at the beginning of the 21st century, there were approximately 700–800 individuals of this subspecies.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mammals of Poland\nFauna of Poland\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Charles Robert Macgillivray (1804?–1867) was a Scottish physician and Gaelic scholar.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMacgillivray was the son of a small farmer. He was born in Kilfinichen, Mull, about 1804. He received his elementary education at the school of his native parish, and when about twenty went to Glasgow, where he found employment in a druggist's shop. In 1849 he commenced business as a druggist, and in 1853 graduated M.D. In 1869 he was appointed lecturer in Gaelic at the Glasgow Institution. He died in Glasgow in 1867.\nMacGillivray was an enthusiastic Gaelic scholar, and assisted Dr. Norman Macleod with his publications. In 1868 he published a Gaelic grammar, but his best-known work is a translation of John Bunyan's 'Pilgrim's Progress' (1869), in which he was helped by Archibald Macfadyen the hymn-writer. He also translated parts of John Howie's 'Scotch Biography' into Gaelic, published in London in 1870–3.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: McDonald, James Ramsay (1893). \"MacGillivray, Charles R.\".

        "content": "The Golden Gander is a 1935 Australia play by Henry C. James and Keith Bean about gold seekers in central Australia. It was presented on the West End at a time when that was rare for Australian plays.\nIt was originally known as The Golden Goose and debuted in 1935 at the Croydon Theatre with Pat Hanna and Coral Brown.\nThe play received mixed reviews and was not a success. However star Coral Brown was well received.\nReviewing the London production, Leslie Rees said \"Any Australian watching the stage must have felt that Mr. James... had squandered one of the most forceful and imaginative of potential Australian themes in inadmissible anticlimax...Mr. James's piece, with its character-types borrowed from the theatrical wardrobe, instead of being observed from life itself, rang cheaply, like a mouth organ played against a symphony orchestra.\"\n\n\n== Background ==\nBrisbane journalist Keith Bean bought the news rights of Charles Chapman's expedition to The Granites in 1932. Bean fell ill then sent Henry C James to the desert. Both went to London, met accidentally, and collaborated on the play.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Golden Gander at Ausstage",

In 2024, a remake with the same title was released.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe Tsar  wants to marry his daughter Princess Zabava to his rich boyar Polkan. But Zabava does not want to marry Polkan, because he is ugly and evil, and she does not love him, and he does not love her. Polkan only needs the tsar's personal connections to increase his wealth and the status of heir to the throne.\nA simple chimney sweep, Vanya, falls in love with Zabava. The love turns out to be mutual. Fun asks Vanya how he will rescue her. He proposes to build a flying ship. Fun tells the king that she will only marry the one who builds a flying ship. The Tsar asks Polkan if he will build it, to which he replies that he will buy it.\nThe heroes take turns singing about their dreams, from which it is clear that the dreams of the Tsar and Polkan are diametrically different from what Zabava dreams of, but the dreams of the main character and his beloved coincide. Ivan meets  Vodyanoy, who sings about his joyless life. The latter helps Vanya build a flying ship by giving him the tools. They turned out to be magical because they will do everything themselves if you manage to hold them.\nPolkan tells the king that he built the flying ship, and now Zabava will be his wife. The king echoes that the ship belongs to him, climbs the stairs to the ship, but, having uttered the first half of the spell known to him, hangs in the air and can neither fly nor descend to the ground. Fun flatly refuses to open the door to Polkan.\nIvan and Zabava have already escaped. Through the pipe, the lovers leave the palace and climb up the stairs, which Polkan forgot to remove, onto the ship. Polkan managed to climb onto the ladder, but Ivan says, “Good luck!”\nThe ship flies away, but Polkan does not have time to climb on and falls from a great height. Ivan and Zabava fly away on the ship.\n\n\n== Voice cast ==\nTatyana Shabelnikova as Princess Zabava\nMikhail Boyarsky as Vanya\nGarri Bardin as Tsar\nRogvold Sukhoverko  as Polkan (songs performed by Mark Aizikovich)\nAnatoly Papanov as Vodyanoy\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Fool of the World and the Flying Ship\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Flying Ship at IMDb \nПлешкова О.

        "content": "The Elsie Effah Kaufmann Foundation (EEKF) is a nonprofit organization that works to improve STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) education in Ghana.\nElsie Effah Kaufmann founded the EEKF in Accra on July 27, 2022. The foundation's goal is to address the current gap in STEM education in Ghana by providing students with the tools necessary to conduct extensive, practical research on the subjects.\nThe foundation aims to raise awareness and educate communities about the value of practical STEM education as well as connect and facilitate cooperation between industry and academia. \n\n\n== Launch ==\nThe official launch of the foundation took place on July 27, 2022, in Accra. Delegates from science institutions in Ghana attended the ceremony. There were also representatives from the National Teaching Council, GhanaThink, the West African Examination Council (WAEC), the US Embassy, and other well-known organizations in the nation.\nThe Elsie Effah Kaufmann Foundation (EEKF) is a non-profit foundation which seeks to improve the teaching of STEM subjects in Ghana. The foundation hope to achieve this goal by giving students access to the resources they need for an in-depth and hands-on study of the disciplines, the Elsie Effah Kaufmann Foundation (EEKF) aims to fill the gap in STEM education currently present in Ghana.\nThe foundation's primary goal is to completely overhaul science education from the ground up, or from the most fundamental level. Since primary grades four through six now follow a new curriculum based on standards and emphasizing practical science, the foundation concentrates on them.\nAdditionally, the EEKF would train science instructors to better prepare them to teach the topic in a way that encourages students to pursue STEM fields.\nEffah Kaufmann at the launch demonstrated how to produce power at the launch, bringing science down to the level of the average person. She showed the guests a basic method of producing power and explained that as learning progressed, the interest was generated and built upon to complicated levels. The guests were taught how to power a light bulb using a plastic casing, copper nails and zinc wires, banku, and salt. The participants built a plastic battery and used the copper nails and zinc wires, banku, and salt to light the bulb.\n\n\n=== Project Alpha ===\nThe purpose of this project is to demystify the teaching and learning of science in Ghanaian Schools and also advocate for the usage of the science set in different schools to make science education more practical,\nThis project was launched as part of  \"Celebrating a year's impact of practical science education in basic schools,\"  to commemorate the EEK Foundation's first anniversary which took pace  at the British Council in Accra. Students and instructors from over a hundred schools participated in practical and hands-on science projects during this event.\nElsie Effah Kaufmann, who has taught and engaged with several scientific students over the years, is certain that providing students with more practical instruction starting in elementary school would be the best investment in them.\nKaufmann emphasizes the urgency of this initiative by stating that, “The time for change is now, parents, teachers, and schools, we cannot compromise. We cannot afford to make a difference now. We need the change. Help us to make science more practical. Help us to make our education more relevant.”\nThe project is made possible through partnership between the foundation and Dext Technology, which makes the scientific kit available for the practical sessions.\nAs part of this project, scientific set which serves as an integrated laboratory are made available to the schools which solves the problem that many elementary schools confront since they lack access to adequate science resources. Now through this project, Students can use these sets to conduct a variety of experiments that will improve their hands-on learning experience and help them comprehend science subjects more deeply.\nAlso as part of the Project Alpha, a free online platform is made available by the Elsie Effah Kaufmann Foundation with support from Dext Technology Limited to track, assess, and maintain STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) initiatives nationwide.\nThe STEM Code platform is intended to give basic schools a special code upon registration, enabling them to complete and evaluate a variety of practical science projects. Officials from the Ghana Education Service (GES) and the West African Examinations Council would then award points based on the completion of these tasks (WAEC).\nThe platform is( also created to help those involved in the STEM field monitor, assess and reward educators and institutions that are dedicated to giving students the hands-on STEM education they need.\n\n\n=== Impact of the Foundation ===\nThe Foundation in just one year, have trained teachers in six regions of Ghana and impacted over 15,000 students.\nSince the STEM Code online platform as part of the Project Alpha was launched, and registration period commenced, 650 schools have registered to benefit from the project\nIn Ghana, more than 200 schools and counting are adapting to the new scientific curriculum for elementary schools as a result of the impact of Project Alpha\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Cleon, commonly referred to by the metonym Empire, is the name of multiple fictional characters in the 2021 Apple TV+ television series Foundation. They are the Genetic Dynasty of clones who rule the Galactic Empire. In the series, the 12,000-year-old Empire has been ruled for 400 years by a revolving trio of Cleon I clones: Brother Day, a Cleon in his prime; Brother Dusk, a retired and aging Cleon who serves in an advisory role; and Brother Dawn, a young Cleon being trained to succeed Brother Day. The series is an adaptation of the Foundation series of novels by Isaac Asimov, and stars Lee Pace as Day, Terrence Mann as Dusk, and Cassian Bilton as Dawn. Cloning does not factor in Asimov's novels, though emperors named Cleon I and Cleon II appear as supporting characters.\n\n\n== Character ==\n\n\n=== Casting and reception ===\nThe trio of Cleon clones are portrayed by Lee Pace (Brother Day), Terrence Mann (Brother Dusk) and Cassian Bilton (Brother Dawn) in the 2021 Apple TV+ television series Foundation. Pace's casting was announced in October 2019, and the  casting of Mann and Bilton was announced in December 2019. Cooper Carter plays Brother Dawn as a child in season one.\nNick Allen of RogerEbert.com described Pace's performance as \"magnetic\", and Chancellor Agard of Entertainment Weekly called it a \"campy and playful turn\". Sean O'Neal of Texas Monthly called Pace's performance \"bombastic\", and wrote, \"Pace was simply born to play a tyrant. His Brother Day comes off like a cross between the Roman emperor Commodus and the Marquis de Sade, a narcissist with swept-back Bradley Cooper hair and a wicked smile that perpetually curls his lips. Pace imbues every line with aristocratic menace, all delivered in his stentorian, Shakespeare in the Park projection.\" James Dyer of Empire: \"Pace brings both weight and humanity to the waning imperium ... while placing a consistent face on the empire at the story's heart.\" Richard Edwards of Space.com wrote that Pace's performance has \"too many echoes of his stern turns\" in Guardians of the Galaxy and the Hobbit films. Early trailers for the series prompted online fans to refer to Pace as \"Intergalactic Emperor Daddy\". Chase Hutchinson of Collider wrote:\n\nPace continues to give one of his best performances to date. He captures the petulance of the character which is made all the more frightening when considering how he can utterly destroy almost anything that he wants. His terrifying monologue from the end of Season 1 looms large over this as we know he has nearly unlimited resources to carry out vengeance on any who cross him ... There is a humor that Pace brings to the character, showing Day's insecurities when he is challenged with an almost pouty face that is just delightful. He is the type of villain that is worth building an entire show around, making his creation for this story a worthwhile one. His ignorance of so much that is happening around him makes him feel more dangerous as there is always the potential that he could lash out without warning.\nDaniel Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that \"The interplay between Mann and Pace as imperious rulers has strong theatrical energy.\" Caroline Framke of Variety wrote that at times, \"Pace and Mann tap into a shared, visceral disdain that betrays more personality than their respective Cleons would likely care to admit exists.\" Sean T. Collins of Decider described Mann's performance in \"The Last Empress\", in which Dusk experiences one shocking revelation after another, as \"fascinating to watch\", and wrote, \"Mann's command of the diverse emotions and affects called for here, making them seem like the product of a single unquiet mind, is deeply impressive.\" Collins also described Bilton's Dawn as \"seemingly aroused equally by the gorgeous Sareth's unabashed come-ons and their secret rebellion against his older bro.\"\nChaim Gartenberg of The Verge called the Genetic Dynasty \"the show's highlight, thanks in no small part to Pace's dynamic performances\". Agard explained, \"This curious political unit raises interesting questions about individuality and if progress is possible without fundamental change, and it's the main source of fun in the show.\"\n\n\n=== Description ===\nIn the 2021 television series adaptation Foundation, the 12,000-year-old Empire has been ruled for 400 years by a revolving trio of Cleon I clones: Brother Day, a Cleon in his prime; Brother Dusk, a retired and aging Cleon who serves in an advisory role; and Brother Dawn, a young Cleon being trained to succeed Brother Day. Though cloning does not factor in Asimov's novels, the television series introduces a \"Genetic Dynasty\", surreptitiously administered for centuries by the regal Lady Demerzel, secretly a unique, ageless humanoid robot. The clones serve as \"the personification of the Empire's permanency, constant and unchanging, ever-present and never-failing.\" In the story, the Imperial triad scoff at mathematician Hari Seldon's predictions of the Empire's imminent fall, and exile him from the capital world, Trantor, to the distant planet Terminus. But thanks to a devastating and unprecedented terrorist attack, their eyes are now opened to the signs that the Empire is indeed decaying.\nIn season one, Dawn conceals his color blindness, an anomaly among the Cleons, from Day and Dusk. He and Day also exhibit signs of unprecedented emotions, making them less detached and cruel than their predecessors, which Dusk believes will spell their doom. It is eventually revealed that the rebel movement has tampered with the Cleon genetics, facing the current Day with the fact that the bloodline is now tainted and he, his successors, and likely a number of his predecessors have irrevocably diverged from the original Cleon. Dusk insists that Dawn, who was easily manipulated by the rebels, be destroyed, but Day shows compassion. Demerzel, however, recognizes the danger that Dawn now poses to the dynasty, and kills him.\nIn season two, a subsequent Day decides to halt the degradation of the bloodline by marrying the newly crowned Queen Sareth of Cloud Dominion and fathering an heir with her. Displeased, Demerzel feigns acceptance, but schemes to prevent the marriage and be rid of Sareth. Demerzel is revealed to be the real power behind the Imperial throne, guiding humanity on a millennial scale. The genetically corrupted Cleons increasingly veer from the path she has set for them, and she begins to act more overtly autonomous, thwarting their choices and actions, and even killing and replacing them with new copies as necessary to preserve her grand scheme for humanity.\nSeries executive producer David S. Goyer invented the clone emperors, who are not in Asimov's novels, as a way of providing some continuity to a story that takes place over a thousand years. O'Neal explained, \"Pace's Brother Day is one of the few characters that we’re actually allowed to connect with\", and described the character as \"the smug embodiment of imperial hubris\". Pace said of the Emperors, \"On one side of their mind, they believe they're the same person. They actually believe this, and they believe that person is the Emperor of the galaxy ... And on the other side of that mind, are a series of individuals who, whether they like it or not, are individuals.\" Daniel Bibby of Screen Rant called the conceit of the Genetic Dynasty \"a well-executed concept that allows for a centuries-long chess match between Empire and Hari Seldon.\" Rafael Motamayor of IGN praised the idea of clone emperors as \"arguably the most fascinating addition to the show, which helps it stand out from the rest of the sci-fi landscape.\"\n\n\n== Storyline ==\n\n\n=== Season 1 ===\nIn \"The Emperor's Peace\", Hari Seldon's predictions of the Galactic Empire's imminent fall, based on his science of psychohistory, are dismissed by Brothers Day, Dawn and Dusk, the trio of Emperor Cleon I clones who rule the Empire. Seldon is spared execution for treason after a devastating terrorist attack—the destruction of the Star Bridge, Trantor's space elevator—illustrates for Day that there is indeed decay within the Empire. Seldon and his followers are exiled to Terminus to establish the \"Foundation\", a repository of human knowledge that Seldon claims will shorten the dark age after the Empire's demise from thirty thousand years to a single millennium. In \"Preparing to Live\", the Empire investigates the Star Bridge attack but is unable to identify its mastermind, or conclusively attribute it to Seldon or the governments of Anacreon or Thespis. Despite Dusk urging that the detained delegations from the two kingdoms should be granted clemency, Day opts for a public execution of all delegates except the two ambassadors, simultaneous with orbital bombardments of their homeworlds. The Genetic Dynasty undertakes its next traditional transfer of power in \"The Mathematician's Ghost\": a new Dawn is decanted, the current Dawn is elevated to Day, the current Day retires as Dusk, and Dusk assumes the mantle of Brother Darkness before being euthanized.\nIn \"Barbarians at the Gate\", a charismatic religious leader, Zephyr Halima Ifa, revives an orthodox, pre-Imperial dogma that asserts clones do not possess souls. This religious issue and a violent insurrection in the lower levels of Trantor fulfill two key portents of the Empire's decline that Seldon related at his trial. Day grows frustrated with Dusk, feeling his elder seeded these problems decades ago by acting impulsively and refusing to heed Seldon's warnings. While Day departs Trantor to intervene with Ifa, Dusk sends a fleet to visit the Foundation, which has fallen silent. In \"Death and the Maiden\", Day attempts to undermine Ifa on the holy moon at the center of the Luminist faith, but she gains the upper hand with a galvanizing speech that subtly criticizes Imperial cloning. On Trantor, Dawn pursues a romance with Azura Odili, a palace gardener, and bares his deepest secret: he inexplicably has minor genetic traits, such as color blindness, that differentiate him from all previous Cleon clones. Day is agitated by his inability to rein in the defiant Ifa in \"Mysteries and Martyrs\", but decides he can upstage her by undertaking Luminism's most sacred pilgrimage. Azura asks Dawn, who lives in constant fear of being replaced by another clone should his uniqueness be exposed, to consider running away with her.\nIn \"The Missing Piece\", Day completes the Spiral, a torturous trek to a desert cave pool, and claims to have received a vision of a sacred flower. The Zephyrs interpret Day's vision as a divine pronouncement that he has a soul, rendering any further criticism of Imperial cloning by a Luminist to be sacrilege, and nullifying any threat from Ifa. Day seals his victory by commanding Demerzel, his devoutly Luminist robot majordomo, to covertly assassinate Ifa. Day reflects on his experience in the cave, revealing he had no vision at all. Dawn realizes Dusk knows his secret and escapes the palace in \"The First Crisis\". He discovers that Azura is part of a rebel conspiracy which plans to replace him with compliant duplicate. Dusk arrives with Imperial troops who dispatch the conspirators and their counterfeit Cleon. In \"The Leap\", Day tells Azura he has killed all of her relatives and everyone she has ever met, and that she will be shrouded for the rest of her life. Day decides to spare Dawn over Dusk's objections, but Demerzel sees the danger Dawn poses to the dynasty and kills him anyway, affirming that her loyalty to the Cleon dynasty supersedes Day's wishes. Day learns that the anti-Empire conspiracy has tainted the DNA of the entire Cleonic line, affecting all future generations.\n\n\n=== Season 2 ===\nIn the season two premiere \"In Seldon's Shadow\", a subsequent Day survives an assassination attempt while he is having sex with Demerzel, and suspects Dawn and Dusk's involvement. Day has decided to halt the degradation of the bloodline by marrying the newly crowned Queen Sareth of Cloud Dominion, and fathering an heir with her. Wary of Day in the aftermath of the deaths of her entire family, Sareth is not enthusiastic about the proposal. Dawn and Sareth form a connection in \"Where the Stars are Scattered Thinly\", and Dusk reconnects with his former lover, Sareth's advisor Rue Corintha. Dusk offers to show Rue recordings of their encounter, as her memories of the event were wiped per protocol. During a heated argument with Day, Sareth accepts his marriage proposal in \"The Sighted and the Seen\". Dusk is disturbed to learn that Day has the authority to conduct memory audits on him and Dawn. Dusk and Dawn's shared distrust of Day grows as they discover that the original Cleon has a much larger memory hoard than subsequent clones, including them. \nIn \"Why the Gods Made Wine\", Day introduces his bride-to-be to the people of Trantor, but Sareth upstages him, wins the crowd and leaves Day feeling unsettled. After Demerzel insinuates she was somehow involved in orchestrating the murders of Sareth's family, Sareth confronts Day in \"A Necessary Death\". She then proposes to Dawn that he impregnate her instead of Day. Day is unnerved by a Seldon avatar, and orders a blockade around Terminus. In \"The Last Empress\", Day decides to deal with the troublesome Foundation on Terminus in person, despite the protestations of Dusk and Demerzel. Dusk, prodded by Corintha, realizes that he has somehow been programmed not to question Demerzel's role or origins. Dusk and Corintha discover a secret chamber guarded by a projection of Cleon I. Dawn and Sareth consummate their relationship as they realize that Demerzel has been controlling the Empire all along.\nIn \"Long Ago, Not Far Away\", Dusk and Corintha learn Demerzel's backstory. Imprisoned for 5,000 years until rediscovered by young Cleon I, Demerzel spends his lifetime telling him stories of the Robot Wars and grooming him to eventually free her. Cleon finally does in his declining years, but ever wary, he implants a chip in her first that enslaves her to his millennia-long plan to rule the universe. He intends for Demerzel to be his immortal successor, with his clones as the face of the Empire, their development and actions subtly controlled by her. Now aware of Demerzel's true function, Dusk and Corintha are trapped in the chamber by Cleon I. On Terminus, Day rages at the revelation that the Foundation's propagandist Church of the Galactic Spirit has been providing forbidden technology to its allies. He stabs the Foundation director, orders the scientists captured alive and everyone else slaughtered. Day confronts Seldon's avatar, and threatens to destroy Terminus if Seldon will not admit his math is flawed. Day believes he is different than all the Cleons before him, and can change the future that Seldon has predicted. But Seldon ignores him and instead speaks to Demerzel. He understands her true role, and gifts her with his Prime Radiant and its psychohistorical equations so that she may use it to guarantee humanity's survival. Though General Bel Riose believes he can end the conflict without violence, Day orders Terminus to be destroyed. Demerzel laments her failures in raising him, and abruptly leaves him on the Imperial flagship and heads back to Trantor. Day grins as Terminus explodes.\nDemerzel confronts the trapped Dusk and Corintha in the season two finale \"Creation Myths\". Dusk marks Demerzel's neck with green paint before Demerzel kills him and Corintha. Dawn recognizes the green mark as the sign of a traitor and flees Trantor with Sareth, who is pregnant with his child. Day is enraged by Riose's defiance of his order to destroy more Foundation-allied worlds, and the revelation that the Imperial fleet is in the process of complete destruction via sabotage. Day battles Riose in hand-to-hand combat, and uses a castling device to switch places with Day via teleportation, venting the Emperor into space and killing him. On Trantor, Demerzel decants three new Cleon clones, and activates the Prime Radiant.\n\n\n== Literary origins ==\nIntroduced in the novella \"Dead Hand\", published in the April 1945 issue of Astounding Science Fiction, Cleon II is the last great Emperor of the Galactic Empire. Threatened by the rising power and popularity of Bel Riose, one of his own generals, Cleon has him recalled and executed for treason.: 26  Josh Wimmer and Alasdair Wilkins of Gizmodo described Cleon II as \"the aging, infirmed emperor whose great mind has been let down by his faltering body.\" Nicholas David Gevers suggested that Cleon II is based on the Byzantine emperor Justinian I.: 57  Cleon II is voiced by William Fox in episode four \"The General\" of the 1973 BBC Radio 4 adaptation The Foundation Trilogy.\nIn the prequel novel Prelude to Foundation (1988), Emperor Cleon I learns of mathematician Hari Seldon's nascent concept of psychohistory. Brought before Cleon, Seldon emphasizes his belief that developing it as a science is likely impossible. Subsequently, interest in Seldon's work by unknown parties puts him in danger, convincing him of psychohistory's potential importance.: 213–215  Wimmer and Wilkens described Cleon as \"basically decent but woefully inadequate\" but also \"a fairly entertaining character, who has me absolutely convinced that ruling a whole galaxy could be just a drag if you were born at the wrong time\".\nIn Forward the Foundation (1993), Seldon and his foster son Raych thwart the scheme of populist Jo-Jo Joranum to become Cleon's First Minister and then overthrow him. The emperor subsequently appoints Seldon as his First Minister. Joranum's associate Gambol Deen Namarti's own plan to assassinate Seldon using a drugged Raych is also foiled, but Cleon is killed by a gardener trying to avoid promotion. A military government subsequently takes over, lasting for a decade.: 222 \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Thomas Hancock (1783 – 6 April 1849) was an Irish physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHancock was born in 1783 of quaker parents in the south of County Antrim, was educated at Ackford, Yorkshire, was apprenticed to a surgeon at Waterford, and graduated M.D. at Edinburgh 26 June 1809. His thesis was 'De Morbis Epidemicis,' a subject in which he was interested throughout 'his life. He became a licentiate of the College of Physicians of London 26 June 1809, and began practice in London, living in Finsbury Square. He attained considerable practice, and was elected physician to the City and Finsbury dispensaries. In 1810 he contributed some articles on lunatic asylums to the 'Belfast Monthly Magazine.' In 1821 he published 'Researches into the Laws and Phenomena of Pestilence, including a medical sketch and review of the Plague of London in 1665 and Remarks on Quarantine.' The book is an enlargement of an address delivered to the Medical Society of London in 1820, and contains much information on epidemics. In 1824 he published an ' Essay on Instinct and its Physical and Moral Relations,' in which he criticises the flippant remarks of Lawrence the surgeon on the Creation, and states clearly the views on instinct which were general before the time of Darwin. His next book appeared in 1825, 'The Principles of Peace exemplified in the Conduct of the Society of Friends in Ireland during the Rebellion of the year 1798,' and has the most lasting value of all his works. Of the many histories of that rebellion this, based entirely upon the statements of eye-witnesses, gives the clearest view of the unsettled, varied, and ignorant notions of the great mass of the insurgents. In 1832 he published 'The Laws and Progress of the Epidemic Cholera,' having shortly before removed to Liverpool, where in 1835 his last work appeared, 'A Defence of the Doctrines of Immediate Revelation and Universal Saving Light, in reply to some remarks contained in a work entitled \" A Beacon to the Society of Friends.\"' In 1838 he left Liverpool and settled in Lisburn, where he resided till his death, from heart disease, on 6 April 1849, aged 66. His works show him to have been a man of extensive reading and sound sense. He was an admirer of Locke, and prized very highly a beautiful little manuscript in Locke's handwriting which he possessed. He edited in 1828 'Discourses,' translated from Nicole's 'Essays by John Locke.' Hancock published anonymously 'An elegy supposed to be written on a field of battle,' 1818, and 'The Law of Mercy, a poetical essay on the punishment of death.'\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1890). \"Hancock, Thomas (1783-1849)\".

        "content": "Kirk Minihane is an American radio host and podcaster. He currently hosts the Barstool Sports podcast The Kirk Minihane Show and co-hosts The Unnamed Show.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMinihane joined WEEI.com as a sports columnist in 2009. In February 2013, he joined the Dennis and Callahan WEEI-FM morning radio show as the third host alongside John Dennis and Gerry Callahan. In August 2016, the show was renamed Kirk and Callahan after Dennis left WEEI.\nIn September 2018, Minihane took an indefinite leave of absence from Kirk and Callahan because of mental-health issues. In November 2018, he left Kirk and Calahan to start his own show on WEEI's parent company, Radio.com. The show never materialized, and Minihane left the company in May 2019. Later that month, he joined Barstool Sports. At Barstool, he hosts The Kirk Minihane Show podcast and The Unnamed Show with Dave Portnoy and Ryan Whitney.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nIn July 2014, Minihane called reporter Erin Andrews a \"gutless bitch\" and said that she should \"drop dead\" for her interview of Adam Wainwright after the 2014 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. He was originally not disciplined for the comments after issuing an apology, but he was later suspended for a week after further criticism of Andrews.\nIn June 2015, Minihane was suspended after an on-air shouting match with Christian Fauria.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMinihane has been open about his struggles with mental health. In August 2018, he was admitted to a hospital after having suicidal thoughts.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Amy Skieresz  (born June 13, 1976) is a retired American middle- and long-distance runner.\nSkieresz is a seven-time NCAA national champion and ten-time All-American in cross country and track and field while competing for the University of Arizona from 1995 to 1998.\n\n\n== High school career ==\nSkieresz attended Agoura High School in Agoura Hills, California.  She placed top-5 in the California State Championships three times, including winning the state title as a junior.  She led her Agoura team to the team title in her freshman and sophomore seasons.  As a sophomore, Skieresz placed 3rd in the Footlocker National Cross Country Championships and was 14th as a senior.  She was a member of the United States team that competed in the World Cross Country Junior Race in Amorebieta, Spain in 1993, finishing as the top American in 39th place.\n\n\n== College career ==\nSkieresz continued her running career at the University of Arizona.  As a freshman, she finished second in the NCAA Cross Country Championships.  Her track season was derailed by a foot injury that prevented her from competing at the NCAA Championships.\nAs a sophomore, Skieresz became the first female in NCAA history to win four national championships in the same school year.  She began by winning the NCAA Cross Country Championships by 16 seconds, one of the largest margins of victory ever.  Skieresz added the NCAA Indoor 5000m title with a new collegiate record time, then finished the year by capturing both the 5000m and 10000m titles at the NCAA Outdoor Championships.  Following the season, she competed in the Olympic Trials in the 5000m where she finished 11th.\nIn her junior season, Skieresz finished runner-up at the NCAA Cross Country Championships for the second time.  She then proceeded to repeat as indoor 5000m champion and outdoor 5000m and 10000m champion.    She remains the only NCAA female to ever accomplish the outdoor 5000m/10000m double twice.  Her margins of victory during her 10000m victories, 63.59 seconds in 1997 and 62.64 seconds in 1998, are the largest in NCAA history of any event including cross country.\nAhead of what was to be the last race of her collegiate career, Skieresz was suffering pain in her right thigh.  She decided to compete in the NCAA Cross Country Championships despite the issue and finished runner-up for the third time.  In doing so, she became the only runner, male or female, to ever finish in the top-2 at the NCAA Cross Country Championships four times.  A few weeks later, doctors diagnosed her injury as a benign tumor in her thigh.  She decided to forgo the remainder of her collegiate eligibility and begin preparations for the 2000 Olympic Trials.\nSkieresz only lost four races in her entire collegiate career, three of which were runner-up finishes at the NCAA Cross Country Championships.  In addition to her seven NCAA championships, she also won seven PAC-10 championships, including four in cross country and three on the track.  Despite only competing for eight seasons (four cross country, two indoor track, two outdoor track), she is one of only five women to win seven or more NCAA championships in a career as a distance runner.  As of March 2024, she still holds Arizona school records in the indoor 5000m and outdoor 10000m, and previously held the record in the outdoor 5000m.\n\n\n== Post college ==\nSkieresz began a professional career with the Nike Project but decided to retire prior to the 2000 Olympic Trials.  In 2004, she joined the coaching staff at the University of Arizona and made a brief return to running, winning the Long Beach Marathon in 2:42:47.\n\n\n== Honors and awards ==\nUniversity of Arizona Athletic Hall of Fame\nUSTFCCCA Collegiate Hall of Fame\nPac-12 Women's Cross Country Runner of the Century\nPac-10 T&F Athlete of year – 1997, 1998\nHonda Sports Award: Cross Country 1997, 1998\nHonda Sports Award: Track and Field 1997, 1998\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nSkieresz married former University of Arkansas All-American Ryan Wilson, himself an NCAA champion in the indoor 3000m.  The couple has three children.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAmy Skieresz at World Athletics",

It is situated 4.93 miles (7.93 km) west of Double Mountain along the west side of Igloo Creek at mile 35 of the Park Road. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains west into Big Creek and east into Igloo Creek, which are both tributaries of the Teklanika River. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises 1,800 feet (550 meters) above Igloo Creek in one mile (1.6 km). This mountain was named in association with Igloo Creek; the name was published in 1954 by the U.S. Geological Survey; and the toponym has been officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nBased on the Köppen climate classification, Igloo Mountain is located in a tundra climate zone with long, cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Winter temperatures can drop below −20 °F with wind chill factors below −30 °F. The months May through June offer the most favorable weather for climbing or viewing.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mountain peaks of Alaska\nGeology of Alaska\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWeather: Igloo Mountain\nNational Park Service site: Denali National Park & Preserve",

        "content": "Robert Pierce, also spelt Peirce, (1622 – June 1710) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPierce was the son of a clergyman in Somerset. He was born in that county in 1622. After attendance at a preparatory school at Bath, he was sent to Winchester, and thence to Lincoln College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 26 October 1638. He graduated B.A. on 15 June 1642, M.A. and M.B. on 21 October 1650, and M.D. on 12 September 1661. His boyhood and youth were sickly, for at ten he had general dropsy, at twelve smallpox, at fourteen tertian ague, and at twenty-one measles with profuse bleeding from the nose. After a short residence in Bristol he settled in practice in a marshy part of Somerset, where in 1652 he had a severe fever, then epidemic, followed by a quartan ague, which weakened him so much that he decided to leave the district. His fellow-collegian, Dr. Christopher Bennet, advised him to try London; but, though there were then three physicians in full practice at Bath, he decided to settle there in 1653, and soon had what was then called ‘a riding practice,’ or frequent calls to consultations at from ten to thirty miles from Bath. On 15 April 1660 he was elected to the office of physician to poor strangers. As the older physicians died off he gradually became a regular Bath physician, often, as was then the custom, taking patients of distinction to reside in his house. Richard Talbot, earl of Tyrconnel, stayed with him for five weeks from April 1686, and was given Quercetanus's tartar pills for several nights, followed by two quarts of the King's Bath water in the morning for several days, as severe measures were needed to fit him within two or three months to take up his Irish government. The Duke of Hamilton, the Duchess of Ormonde, the Marchioness of Antrim, Lord Stafford, and General Talmash or Tollemache, afterwards mortally wounded at Brest, were among his patients, and he cured Captain Harrison, son-in-law of Bishop Jeremy Taylor, of lead palsy. Sir Charles Scarborough, Sir William Wetherby, Sir John Micklethwaite, Dr. Phineas Fowke, Dr. Gideon Harvey, Dr. Richard Lower, Dr. Short, and many other famous physicians sent patients to him. In 1689 he visited London, and, having been nominated in James II's new charter to the College of Physicians, was admitted a fellow on 19 March 1689. He had earned this honour by many original observations. He is probably the first English writer who noted the now well-known occurrence of acute rheumatism as a sequel to scarlet fever (History of the Bath, p. 12); and his account of Major Arnot's case (p. 45), in which muscular feebleness of the arm followed the constant carrying of a heavy falcon on one fist, is the first suggestion of the morbid conditions now described as ‘trade palsies.’ The lympho-sarcoma of the pericardium, which he discovered post mortem in the case of Sir Robert Craven, is the first described in any English medical book. These three original observations entitle him to a high place among English physicians, and his book contains many others of great interest. In 1697 he published ‘Bath Memoirs, or Observations in three-and-forty years' practice at the Bath,’ of which a second edition appeared in 1713 as ‘The History and Memoirs of the Bath.’ He died in June 1710.\nPierce married a daughter of David Pryme of Wookey, Somerset, and had one daughter, who had an only son, born in 1679.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1896). \"Pierce, Robert\".

This conflict began in 1961 and ended in 1963 after the Kennedy administration failed to influence the events in Portugal and in Africa, mainly in Angola and, according to Professor Luís Rodrigues, \"Portugal proved to be the little David who ultimately forced Goliath to change its behavior.\"\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn May 1960 the then president of the United States of America, Eisenhower visited Lisbon and was introduced with António de Oliveira Salazar, who was alarmed by \"the creation of a multitude of new independent nations\" in Africa and argued that nationalism could be the ideal antidote to the penetration of communism.\n\n\n== Angola question ==\n\nThe election of John F. Kennedy was a matter of serious concern to the Portuguese government, which feared that the new president of the United States would adopt an anti-colonialism position; in March 1961 Kennedy decided that the USUN should vote in favor of a resolution by creating a commission to investigate what was happening in Angola. On that same day, members of the União dos Povos de Angola (UPA) launched a terrorist attack against Portuguese settlers and administrative posts in Northern Angola. This attack would initiate a war that would last until the Carnation Revolution in 1974.\nThe United States believed it should abandon their vague attitude towards European colonialism and start supporting the self-determination of Africans, therefore, they began to intensify their contacts with Angolan nationalist organizations, especially the UPA, which was led by Holden Roberto. On the other hand, the administration, imposed a new arms policy against Portugal in August 1961. The United States refused to sell Portugal military equipment destined for \"non-NATO\" purposes, ruling out its use in Africa and John Kennedy himself advised António Salazar for Portugal to abandon its overseas territories in Africa.\nThis new policy was proved to be short-lived, and in 1962 the US began to abstain itself from voting on resolutions against Portuguese colonialism or even sometimes rejecting them. American contacts with Angolan factions also significantly reduced and military equipment was, once again, being shipped to Portugal. This was mainly due to the American military base in the Azores, which was very important and one of the reasons why Portugal, a non-democratic and colonial nation was able to be part of NATO.\n\n\n== Botelho Moniz coup attempt ==\nThe Botelho Moniz coup of 1961 was an attempted constitutional coup d'état in Portugal, led by the General Botelho Moniz, with the objective of removing Salazar from power. While it is not officially confirmed, it is believed that the United States of America allegedly supported Moniz and were hoping for changes in the political orientation of the Portuguese administration.\n\n\n== \"Angola or the Azores?\" ==\nWhile the Americans wanted to implement their resolution on Portuguese colonial policy in Angola, they could not forget about their military base in the Azores, because if they had angered the Portuguese, there would be a possibility that they wouldn't renew the contract that allowed that base to exist.\nThe American military base in the Azores was very important as it was placed in a strategic position in the Atlantic Ocean and with the Cold War raging on, the United States could not afford to lose it. The Portuguese knew about this and so they used it as their \"Trump card\" to obtain favourable responses from them.\n\nThe potential denial of the Azores would result in a substantial loss of air transport cargo capacity and lead to increased troop deployment closure times. Second, the absence of the Azores would necessitate routing aircraft over less favorable weather conditions, particularly impacting air refueling operations for deploying tactical fighter aircraft. Third, the loss of the base would diminish the flexibility of air operations by limiting available routes. Finally, it would severely impair command and control of military air operations over a significant portion of the Atlantic Ocean.\nConclusion of the debate\nThe \"Angola or Azores\" debate concluded around the middle of 1962. President Kennedy had decided himself after listening to the Pentagon and proponents of the European interests. The Anti-Portuguese policies approved in 1961 were to undergo a gradual shift towards a more pro-Portuguese stance. Despite his initial leaning towards the African rebels viewpoint, Kennedy recognized the significance of the Azores base to the United States' national security and the nation's overseas base infrastructure.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nLooking at United States-Portugal relations during the Kennedy era, it's clear that American dominance had its limits. Despite its power, the United States couldn't control events in Portugal as it wished. It was the American government that had to change its policies to face the challenges posed by Portugal.\nUnited States-Portugal relations would remain strained until the Carnation Revolution, which allowed them to be repaired.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPortuguese Colonial War\nAntónio de Oliveira Salazar\nJohn F.

        "content": "Plunge is the fourth studio album by American singer-songwriter Sam Evian, released on March 22, 2024, through Flying Cloud Recordings and Thirty Tigers. It received positive reviews from critics.\n\n\n== Recording and title ==\nThe album was recorded live to tape at Flying Cloud Studios in upstate New York and includes contributions from Evian's partner Hannah Cohen, Liam Kazar, El Kempner of Palehound, and Adrianne Lenker of Big Thief. The album was named for Evian taking daily polar plunges.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nPlunge received a score of 79 out of 100 on review aggregator Metacritic based on five critics' reviews, indicating \"generally favorable\" reception. Uncut found it to be \"a loose, luscious listen, with a timeless sound\". Glide Magazine's Ryan Dillon commented that Evian's \"status as a producer shines on this album as the artist pieces together a plethora of emotions and sets them to even more expansive and awe-inspiring arrangements\".\nAllMusic's Marcy Donelson felt that \"its breezy mix of radio-friendly, late-'60s and '70s singer/songwriter, psychedelic, and power pop brings it closer in line with cited inspirations like the Beatles, solo George Harrison, and Harry Nilsson, among many others\". Sean Fennell of Paste said that although Plunge is not very distinct from his prior work, \"there is nothing diminishing about the returns this time around—especially when you consider just how pristine a sound Evian is able to pull from his impressive cast of collaborators on this occasion\". Under the Radar's Mark Moody called it \"blessed with tight writing, surefire melodies, and a cast of all-star musicians\" and found it \"well worth jumping into\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nMusicians\n\nSam Evian – lead vocals\nHannah Cohen – background vocals (tracks 2, 4, 7)\nMegan Lui – background vocals (tracks 2, 7)\nAdrianne Lenker – background vocals (track 4)\nLiam Kazar – background vocals (track 4)\nMichael Coleman – background vocals (track 4)\nSantiago Mijares – background vocals (track 4)\nSean Mullins – background vocals (track 4)\nZhana Whyche – background vocals (track 4)\nTechnical\n\nSam Evian – production, mixing, engineering\nHeba Kadry – mastering\nPhil Weinrobe – co-production, engineering (tracks 3, 4)\nAdrianne Lenker – co-production (track 3)\nVisuals\n\nRiley Donahue – design\nCJ Harvey – photography\nJosh Goleman – photography\n\n\n== References ==",

Sarff then made four starts for James Hylton Motorsports in 1998, driving the No. 44 Buick, where he earned a best finish of eighteenth at Shady Bowl Speedway, and would make sporadic starts for his own team and for Hylton from 1999 to 2000.\nIn 2001, Sarff ran all but five races held that year, driving a variety of entries fielded by his own team, Hylton, Norm Benning Racing, Del Markle, Mark Gibson Racing, and Cunningham Motorsports, getting two top ten finishes with a best result of ninth at Nashville Superspeedway on his way to finish thirteenth in the final points standings. He then attempted the full 2002 schedule, only failing to qualify for the event at Lowe's Motor Speedway. Throughout the year, he earned six top twenty finishes with a best finish of thirteenth at Nashville, and finished seventeenth in the final points standings.\nIn 2003, Sarff only ran three races, finishing in the top-twenty four times and earned a best finish of tenth in his final start of the year at Talladega Superspeedway, For the following year, Sarff announced that the team acquired sponsorship from Quaker Steak and Lube for the 2004 season, although he only made three starts with his own team. He also attempted two more races that year, one for Mark Gibson Racing at South Boston Speedway, where he finished 28th due to transmission issues, and the other for Wayne Peterson Racing at Gateway International Raceway, where he failed to qualify.\nAfter not racing in the series from 2005 to 2009, Sarff announced that he would attempt to qualify for the season opening race at Daytona International Speedway, driving his self-owned No. 38 Dodge, although he ultimately failed to qualify for the race. He stated that the Daytona event would be the only race he would attempt, as he would hand the driving duties of No. 38 to Alex Kennedy, although he did drive the No. 28 Chevrolet for Hixson Motorsports at Texas Motor Speedway, where he started seventeenth but finished 32nd after running only seventeen laps due to rear end issues. The Texas event is his most recent event as a driver, as he has not raced in the series since then.\n\n\n== Motorsports results ==\n\n\n=== ARCA Racing Series ===\n(key) (Bold – Pole position awarded by qualifying time. Italics – Pole position earned by points standings or practice time. * – Most laps led.)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGreg Sarff driver statistics at Racing-Reference",

        "content": "Biddulph Town Hall is a municipal building in the High Street in Biddulph, a town in Staffordshire, in England. It currently serves as the meeting place of Biddulph Town Council and as a venue for concerts and other public events.\n\n\n== History ==\nFollowing significant population growth, largely associated with the mining industry, a local board of health was formed in the area in 1882. After the local board of health was replaced by Biddulph Urban District Council in 1894, the new council established its offices on the east side of the High Street.In the early 1960s, council leaders decided to demolish the existing offices and to erect a modern town hall on the same site. The staff relocated to temporary offices while the construction work, which was budgeted at £72,000, was undertaken. The new building was designed in the modern style, built in concrete and glass and was officially opened in May 1966.The design involved an asymmetrical main frontage of six bays facing onto the High Street. The left-hand bay featured a prominent glazed section which was projected out over the pavement on piers, with an entrance below. The right-hand section of five bays was fenestrated by casement windows on both floors. The whole structure was flat roofed. Internally, the principal room was the council chamber on the first floor.The town hall ceased to be the local seat of government when the enlarged Staffordshire Moorlands Council was formed in 1974. The new council continued to use the offices, while also providing space for a police station in the building. In 1983, a wheel from Victoria Colliery was placed outside the building, to commemorate the town's history.In 2016, the ground floor was remodelled, with work including a glazed extension to the main reception. In 2020, Biddulph Town Council took over management of the town hall, including arrangements for concerts and other public events.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 1861 Georgia gubernatorial election was held on October 2, 1861, in order to elect the Governor of Georgia. It was the first gubernatorial election in Georgia under the Confederate States of America and saw Democratic nominee and incumbent Governor Joseph E. Brown win a third term against Anti-Brown Democratic nominee Judge E. A. Nisbet.\nBrown's opposition did not want him to go unchallenged and so held an Anti-Brown convention at Milledgeville where they nominated Judge E. A. Nisbet for the governorship. Concerned about the prospect of Brown serving a third term, they argued that too frequent reelections would convert the governorship into a dictatorship and that Brown should willingly relinquish the office to Nisbet. Furthermore, a writer accused Brown of demagoguery and condemned him for nursing his \"pet brigadiers,\" specifically mentioning Brown's conduct in keeping Brigadier General C. J. Phillips in camp at a cost of $100,000 to the state.\nIn a letter to the people of Georgia, Brown attacked the Milledgeville caucus as being unnecessary, accusing Nisbet of being the candidate of the \"politicians\". He also accused his opposition of wishing to bring back political strife and oppose the will of the people. Supporters of Brown asserted that Nisbet had spent most of his life in the city and that his health was too delicate to undertake the heavy tasks of the governor's office. Additionally, they accused the Anti-Brown Democrats of being \"neutral Yankees.\"\nDespite winning the governorship with 58.63% of the vote, Brown was met with a Nisbet legislature in November 1861, and it was prophesied that this body would \"give him the devil.\" Throughout the duration of the war, this legislature proved to be a persistent source of difficulty for Brown, complicating his governance during the war years.\n\n\n== General election ==\nOn election day, October 2, 1861, Democratic nominee Joseph E. Brown won re-election by a margin of 13,691 votes against Anti-Brown Democratic nominee E. A. Nisbet, thereby becoming the first person to hold the office of Governor of Georgia for three terms.\n\n\n== References ==",

She began studying painting as a child, beginning her official study at Oberlin College. She also made frequent trips to Europe, where she studied art.\nOn August 12, 1886, Steese married Denver Evans, a fruit importer. She went on to earn a degree from the Chicago Art Institute in 1904, where she studied under William Merritt Chase, Albert Herter, Lawton S. Parker, and Frank Duveneck. From 1905 to 1925, Benton exhibited at the Art Institute of Chicago's annual exhibitions.\nFor several years, Benton lived in Italy, where she studied under Vitore Zanetti Zilla in Venice. In 1911 and 1912, she showed her art at the Paris Salon and the Paris Internationale.\nIn 1911, due to health reasons, the Evans family moved to Scottsdale, Arizona. She built an Italian-style villa at the base of Camelback Mountain. Her home became a meeting place for artists of many disciplines. She held weekly salons to support the arts. Evans painted oils and watercolors of the Southwestern landscape, showing her work in European and American venues.\nEvans's work was collected by many institutions. Notably, the Santa Fe Railroad collected more works by Evans than any other woman.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nPhoenix Municipal Exposition, first prize\nArizona Women's Hall of Fame, 1989\n\n\n== References ==",

It was under the command of the Drenica Group, which was part of the Kosovo Liberation Army and led by Fatmir Limaj and Sylejman Selimi. It operated since early 1998, primarily detaining ethnic Serbs, including Albanians accused of collaborating with Milosevic's regime. The camp was established solely by Sylejman Selimi, a leader of the KLA.                                                                                                                                                \n\nOne of the operators of the  camp, Sylejman Selimi, also known as the Sultan, was later convicted by Kosovo courts of torturing civilian prisoners in the camp. He received an eight-year prison sentence, which was later reduced to seven years by the court.\n\n\n== References ==",

Additionally, he was a member of the 7th Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada from 2012 to 2014.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBorn on 5 June 1950, in the Ukrainian city of Donetsk. He received a degree in metalworking from Donetsk Polytechnic Institute (now Donetsk National Technical University) in 1972.\n\n\n== Career ==\nRyzhenkov worked for the Donetsk Metallurgical Plant from 1972 to 1980. Ryzhenkov went on to serve in the political and governing bodies of the Leninsky district of Donetsk from 1980 to 1994. He became the Donetsk Metallurgical Plant's general director in 1994 and remained there until 1996. Later, in 1996, he moved to the position of chair of the executive committee of open joint-stock company Donetsk Metallurgical Plant, which he has held ever since.\nHis leadership grew even further when he was appointed head of the board and then the general girector of the Metallurgical Plant of PJSC Donetskstal from December 1994 and November 2012. He has been the president of the metallurgical facility at PJSC Donetskstal since November 2012. In addition to his corporate positions, Ryzhenkov was elected as a People's Deputy of Ukraine in October 2012, and took office on 10 November. On 25 December 2012, he assumed leadership of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine's Committee on Finance and Banking, substantially expanding his power.\nBased on the Donetsk Metallurgical Plant's property and open-hearth shops, PJSC Donetskstal was founded in October 2002. Under Ryzhenkov's leadership, it focuses on the following: construction supplies, iron-containing goods, slag items, and limestone manufacturing products; carbon, structural, low-alloy steel; church bells created from colored high-quality alloy.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nRyzhenkov is married and has three children. One of his son is Yuriy Ryzhenkov, the CEO of Metinvest Holding.\nOleh Liashko, the head of the Radical Party, announced on 2 August 2018, that he had made 16 million hryvnias from the selling of a property to Ryzhenkov. Ukrainska Pravda wrote this in reaction to Liashko's press statement. They did not say which flat was sold by Liashko.\n\n\n== Awards and recognitions ==\n\nBased on the TOP-100 list of the top 100 managers in Ukraine, Ryzhenkov was named one of the best managers in 2009. In 2010, he was named a Hero of Ukraine Order of the State for his exceptional individual contribution to developing Ukraine's industrial possibilities, producing competitive metallurgical products, and introducing incredibly effective kinds of leadership through years of selfless work.

        "content": "WWE Speed is an American professional wrestling streaming television program produced by WWE. It airs on the social media platform X. Speed features wrestlers from WWE's Raw, SmackDown, and NXT brands. Episodes have one match each with a time limit of three minutes which are taped on the weekdays prior to WWE Raw and WWE SmackDown. The series premiered on April 3, 2024, with two episodes.\n\n\n== History ==\nOn February 7, 2024, the American professional wrestling promotion WWE filed to trademark the name \"WWE Speed\" for an in-ring program in which the concept would be that the professional wrestling matches would have a five-minute time limit. The concept was first tested as dark matches after the December 15, 2023, taping of Friday Night SmackDown. On February 8 during the WrestleMania XL Kickoff press conference, WWE announced a partnership with X to introduce WWE Speed, which would stream weekly on the social media platform. The deal between WWE and X was confirmed for two years. It was also revealed that the matches for each episode would be exclusive to the platform and would not be repurposed from WWE's other programs, and it would feature wrestlers from all three of WWE's brands: Raw, SmackDown, and NXT.\nOn March 27, WWE commentator Corey Graves announced that Speed would premiere on Wednesday, April 3, 2024, but matches would instead be three minutes in length. A tournament was also announced to crown the inaugural WWE Speed Champion for men. The debut episode, which was uploaded at 12 p.m. Eastern Time (ET), saw Ricochet defeat Dragon Lee. Roughly 30 minutes later, WWE uploaded a second episode in which Bronson Reed defeated Cedric Alexander. Graves served as the sole commentator for the episodes.\n\n\n== On-air personalities ==\n\n\n=== Commentators ===\n\n\n=== Ring announcers ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "William Macpherson (19 July 1812 – 20 April 1893) was a Scottish legal writer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMacpherson was born on 19 July 1812. He was the brother of John Macpherson and of Samuel Charters Macpherson. He was educated at Charterhouse and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated B. A. in 1834, and M.A. in 1838. Called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1837, he published in 1841 a 'Practical Treatise on the Law relating to Infants' (Edinburgh, 8vo), which attracted notice owing to its learning and accuracy. In 1846 he went to India to practice at the Indian bar, and in 1848 was given by Sir Laurence Peel, chief-justice of Bengal, the post of master of equity in the supreme court in Calcutta. His 'Procedure of the Civil Courts of India' (Calcutta, 1850, 8vo) became at once a recognised authority, reaching a fifth edition in 1871, and his 'Outlines of the Law of Contracts as administered in the Courts of British India' was issued in London in 1860. He spent nearly two years (1854–5) in England on leave, and finally left India in March 1859. In October 1860 he was entrusted by John Murray the publisher with the editorship of the 'Quarterly Review.' He held that office till October 1867, contributing three articles to the ' Review,' viz. 'Scottish Character' (July 1861), 'The Stanhope Miscellanies' (January 1863), and 'Law Reform' (October 1864). In December 1861 he became secretary of the Indian Law. Commission, which was appointed to prepare a body of substantive law for India, and he withdrew from literary work in 1867 in order to devote himself solely to that work. The Indian Succession Act of 1865 illustrates the value of the commission's labours, but owing to the Indian government's desire to exercise more direct control over the undertaking, the commission was dissolved in December 1870. Macpherson thereupon returned to the bar, and practiced chiefly before the privy council. His useful 'Practice of the Privy Council Judicial Committee,' first published in 1860, reached a second edition in 1873. In 1874 he began reporting the Indian appeals before the privy council for the Council of Law Reporting. In June 1874 he became legal adviser to the India office, and in September 1879 exchanged that post for that of secretary in the judicial department. He retired from the India office on 20 February 1882. 'Memorials' by him of his brother, Samuel Charters Macpherson, appeared in 1865. He died in London on 20 April 1893. He married, on 9 January 1851, Diana Macleod Johnston, who died in 1880, and left issue.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Goodwin, Gordon (1893). \"Macpherson, William\".

        "content": "Bolton Old Hall is a historic building in Bolton-on-Swale, a village in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThe building was originally constructed as a three-storey peel tower, perhaps in the 1380s, by Richard Scrope, 1st Baron Scrope of Bolton.  A two-storey south wing was added, probably in the 16th century, and then in 1680 the whole building was altered, the tower reduced to two storeys, and the windows replaced.  It became the dower house for Kiplin Hall.  In 1963, it was sold to the Stevenson family, who extended the building to provide five bedrooms, and planted exotic trees in the grounds.  In 2021, it was put up for sale for £1.25 million.\nThe house has been Grade II* listed since 1969.  A local tradition states that a tunnel runs from the house to the graveyard of St Mary's Church, Bolton-on-Swale.\nThe house is built of roughcast stone with quoins, and a pantile roof with stone coping and finials.  The tower has been reduced to two storeys and has one bay, and recessed to the right is a later two-storey four-bay wing.  In the ground floor of the tower is a sash window, over it is a blocked mullioned window, and above in the battlement are two arrowslits.  On the front of the wing is a porch with panelled Tuscan pilasters, a frieze and a swan-neck pediment containing a chamfered panel carved with a fist holding a laurel wreath.  The windows are sashes, in the ground floor with chamfered surrounds, and in the upper floor in architraves with keystones.  The ground floor of the tower has plasterwork dating from 1680, and one of the first floor rooms also has a 17th-century plaster ceiling.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGrade II* listed buildings in North Yorkshire\nListed buildings in Bolton-on-Swale\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Piper (c.1810 – ?), also known as John Piper and Jemmy Piper, was a Wiradjuri man from the Bathurst region of New South Wales who led Sir Thomas Mitchell's 1836 expedition along the Lachlan, Murrumbidgee and Murray Rivers and into what is now known as the State of Victoria.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nDetails of Piper's early life are unclear, except that he was born around 1810 into a Wiradjuri clan near to the site what soon after became the British military outpost of Bathurst. As a boy he survived the Bathurst War between the colonists and his people. It appears that he obtained the name of Piper during adolescence after becoming associated, probably as servant, with the military officer John Piper who was granted the estate of Alloway Bank near Bathurst in the mid-1820s.\n\n\n== Mitchell's 1836 expedition ==\nIn 1836, the chief surveyor of the colony of New South Wales, Thomas Mitchell, was tasked with exploring the major rivers to the south-west of Sydney. He arrived in Bathurst in March of that year with his entourage of around 25 men, herds of livestock, and drays filled with supplies. At Bathurst, he entered into an agreement with Piper to act as a guide and envoy to assist the large group through the lands of the 'savage natives'. As part of the arrangement, Piper was given a horse, food, clothes and weapons, including a carbine and sword.\n\nPiper led Mitchell's expedition down the Lachlan River, where he interacted with the local Wiradjuri clans, facilitating the travel through their countries. Piper initially maintained traditional culture such as refusing to emu meat, which was reserved for elders, and following prolonged introductory customs when meeting new tribesmen.\nHowever, as the expedition proceeded, Piper soon realised as being part of an armed British group, he had a unique authority over other Aboriginal people. At Lake Cargelligo he was allowed to take a wife, subsequently named Kitty, from the Indigenous people who lived there. The expedition also took on other Wiradjuri guides along the Lachlan, such as Barney, Tommy-came-first, Tommy-came-last and the female widow Turandurey, who acted as deputies to Piper.\nOn arriving at the Murrumbidgee River, Piper was no longer able to understand the language of the local people saying they spoke \"Irish\". However, there was a Wiradjuri man living there who was able to assist in translation. As the group travelled west along the Murray River they encountered a group of Barkandji people from the Darling River at Lake Benanee. They had heard of Mitchell's expedition and had journeyed from the Darling to confront Mitchell for killing several of their kinspeople on that river a year beforehand. Piper attempted negotiations but Mitchell became deeply suspicious of their actions, and on 27 May 1836, his men opened fire on a large group in what is now known as the Mount Dispersion massacre. Piper seems to have participated in the shooting and was afterwards informed that seven Barkandji were killed, although this is probably an underestimate.\nIn a similar situation at Lake Boga, Piper was confronted by a group of 12 local Indigenous men who were angry at Piper for bringing white people to their country and threw spears at him. Piper subsequently shot one of them dead.\nAs Mitchell's group entered what is now Victoria, Piper became homesick for Bathurst, but Mitchell was very supportive for Piper to remain. Mitchell regarded Piper as the most accomplished member of his group, being the tallest, bravest, best hunter, swimmer and diver, and was now able to speak multiple Indigenous languages. Piper was still able to communicate with the local people in what was a very foreign land and obtained the name of the Wimmera River from local people.\nOn the return journey to Sydney, Piper continued to assist Mitchell's group, including informing them how to make a sweet drink from steeping ironbark blossoms in water. When an expedition member named Taylor disappeared while crossing the Broken River, Piper was foremost in diving into the river to locate him. Piper brought the unconscious man to the surface but Taylor was not able to be resuscitated.\n\n\n== Life in Sydney and Bathurst ==\nWhen the expedition arrived back in Sydney, Piper was regarded as a minor celebrity. He was given a coat, and a hat that once belonged to Governor Ralph Darling. He took another wife and was given money by members of the public. He was also given firearms and a brass plate engraved with his name and the title of \"Conqueror of the Interior\".  Piper soon after returned to his homeland of Bathurst accompanied by Mitchell's other Wiradjuri guides Tommy-came-first and Tommy-came-last. Bureemal, the convicted killer of the botanist Richard Cunningham, was also placed under Piper's authority to be returned to Wiradjuri country.\nAccording to Mitchell, Piper journeyed extensively in the years after the 1836 expedition, travelling to Adelaide, Moreton Bay and the Hunter Region.\n\n\n== Mitchell's 1846/47 expedition ==\nIn December 1846, Mitchell started on another expedition, this time into the uncolonised northern parts of the New South Wales. He again set out from the Bathurst region and again took on Piper as his main Indigenous guide. Piper was given a horse, clothing, rations and a double-barrelled shotgun. However, Piper soon became disillusioned with the expedition and it was revealed to Mitchell that he was going to abandon the group, taking with him Mitchell's other Aboriginal guide, Yuranigh. Despite Piper's clear importance to Mitchell in the previous expedition, Mitchell now viewed Piper as unforgivably disloyal, referring to him as a 'true savage'. Before Piper could enact his plan, Mitchell had him arrested and placed in chains. Piper was sent back to Bathurst under police escort. Nothing further is known of Piper.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nPiper is remembered by having a street named after him in the town of Balranald, and Pipers Creek near Kyneton was also named in his honour.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Indigenous Australian historical figures\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Normandina pulchella, commonly known as the elf-ear lichen or blue heart, is a species of squamulose lichen in the family Verrucariaceae. This cosmopolitan species is widely distributed across both hemispheres, where it thrives in moist microhabitats. It favours moss-covered deciduous trees and rocks, often colonising over mosses and bryophytes. It occasionally grows on bare bark and on other lichens. Distinctive features of N. pulchella include its bluish-green squamules (scales) with sharply raised margins, non-reactivity to standard chemical spot tests, and growth in humid habitats. Initially, Nannochloris normandinae, a green alga, was thought to be its photobiont. However, recent studies have revised this understanding, now suggesting Diplosphaera as the algal partner.\nFirst named and scientifically described by the English botanist William Borrer in 1831, the clarification of Normandina pulchella's place within the Verrucariaceae, facilitated by molecular phylogenetics analysis in 2010, resolved long-standing taxonomic uncertainties.  Prior classifications had varied widely, placing N. pulchella within groups such as the Basidiomycota (i.e., as a basidiolichen) and Fungi incertae sedis, largely due to differing interpretations of the perithecia (fruiting bodies) found within the lichen. These discrepancies stemmed from confusion over whether the perithecia belonged to the lichen itself or were instead associated with a parasitic lichenicolous fungus.\n\n\n== Systematics ==\n\n\n=== Taxonomic history ===\n\nThe lichen was originally formally described in 1831 by the English botanist William Borrer, who classified it within the genus Verrucaria. He coined the vernacular name \"little filmy-leaved Verrucaria\" due to its distinctive morphology. The specific epithet pulchella is the Latin diminutive of pulchra, 'beautiful' or 'fair'. He observed the lichen to be characterised by thin, membranous, greenish-grey, leaf-like scales, with these features transitioning from smooth, rounded forms to crowded, waved, and lobed configurations, whilst adorned with powdery granules. The underside of these scales is distinguished by a pale brown colour and woolly fibres. Borrer described the lichen's tubercles as nearly globular and black. These tubercles reveal only their apex through the thallus surface, exposing a gelatinous, brownish nucleus with a central pore. He noted the lichen's frequent occurrence on mossy trees in Sussex, and that it thrived on the leafy liverwort species Jungermannia dilatata, forming wide but often interrupted patches. Ellen Hutchins was credited by Borrer for initially discovering the species on a mountain near Bantry (Ireland), growing on Lichen plumbeus on heath stems. He remarked on the lichen's uniqueness:  \"This curious little production is so unlike to every other Lichen, that its very genus must have remained doubtful but for Miss Hutchins's fortunate discovery of the tubercles. Acharius, to whom Sussex specimens were communicated, thought it a Thelephora, thus excluding it even from the natural order to which we hold it to belong.\" Despite its prevalence in Sussex, Borrer mentioned that it appeared to have been overlooked elsewhere. In another publication that year, Borrer proposed to transfer it to the genus Endocarpon. However, this was nomenclaturally invalid because the name had already been for a different species, violating the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature guidelines. William Nylander transferred the taxon to the genus Normandina in 1861.\n\n\n=== Classification ===\nRecent advancements have clarified the classification of Normandina pulchella, addressing ambiguities and refining its placement within the systematic taxonomy. Initially, perithecia found within the thallus led to confusion, as these were later attributed to the parasitic fungus Sphaerulina chlorococca rather than to Normandina pulchella itself. This misunderstanding contributed to significant taxonomic challenges regarding the lichen's classification. Historically, N. pulchella was often classified as a basidiolichen, largely due to its morphological similarities with Coriscium viride, associated with the basidiomycete Omphalina hudsoniana. However, the discovery that Normandina lacks dolipore septa — key features of basidiomycetes — cast doubt on its classification as a basidiolichen. Despite this, the exact systematic position of Normandina remained unresolved.\n\nA cytological study revealed that Normandina pulchella has a complex structure with separate fungal and algal layers, a characteristic of heteromerous thalli. This structure plays a key role in its life processes, distinguishing it from basidiolichens. Specifically, the medulla, or inner layer, contains hyaline (transparent) fungal filaments entwined around small clusters of algal cells. These cells have thick walls and a singular, lobate chloroplast containing a distinct metameric pyrenoid – a structure assisting in starch formation, along with small starch grains and fat-containing plastoglobuli.\nThe fungal partner, or mycobiont, was found to have hyphae featuring simple perforated septa, a type of internal cell division within the hyphae, accompanied by Woronin bodies – organelles unique to ascomycetes, a large fungal group. Additionally, the close yet non-invasive relationship between the fungal and algal cells suggested a mutualistic association typical of ascolichens. The exclusive presence of Woronin bodies and the characteristics of the algal partner align with traits typically found in ascomycetes and their associated algae in ascolichens. This evidence collectively shifted Normandina pulchella away from being classified as a basidiolichen, as some previous studies suggested, firmly placing it within the ascolichens.\nIn 2010, Lucia Muggia and colleagues employed molecular phylogenetics analysis to conclusively classify Normandina pulchella within the family Verrucariaceae, resolving longstanding classification debates.\n\n\n=== Common names ===\nIn addition to Borrer's original suggestion (\"little filmy-leaved Verrucaria\"), other vernacular names that have been used to refer to this lichen are \"blue heart\", and \"elf ear lichen\".\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nNormandina pulchella has a squamulose (scaly) thallus, composed of small, scale-like formations termed squamules. The squamules display colours ranging from glaucous—a bluish-green or grey—to pale grey or greenish-grey, intensifying to a richer green when moistened. Each squamule can span up to 5 mm across and may include one or more broadly rounded lobes, each up to 1.7 mm in diameter, reminiscent of shell or ear shapes. The upper surface of these lobes features concentric ridges, while the edges are sharply defined and raised, typically spanning 50–100 micrometres (µm) in width. The squamules may be dispersed or densely packed across the lichen's surface. The thallus is closely appressed to the substrate.\nFor vegetative reproduction, N. pulchella develops soralia—structures on the lobe surfaces and edges—that discharge granular particles known as soredia. These soralia are green or match the colour of the lobes and contain granular soredia measuring 40–80 µm in diameter. The underside of the lichen presents a whitish, slightly felted (tomentose) appearance and adheres to its substrate through numerous fungal strands, or hyphae. Rhizines do not occur in this species.\n\nIts spore-producing structures, or ascomata, resemble those in related species but are distinguished by their uniformly pigmented, cohesive nature under microscopic analysis. The ascospores are typically 29–37 by 6–7 µm, mostly with seven internal partitions, known as septa. Chemical analysis, particularly thin-layer chromatography, identify zeorin as a secondary metabolite (lichen product), yet N. pulchella remains unresponsive to standard chemical spot tests.\n\n\n=== Similar species ===\nThe squamules of Lichenomphalina hudsoniana share the neat, sharply defined edges characteristic of N. pulchella. However, they can be distinguished by their lack of soralia, the presence of both upper and lower cortices, and adaptation to arctic-alpine environments, typically growing on peaty soil or decaying wood. In contrast, N. pulchella tends to develop more pronounced soralia in shaded, humid settings, diverging from the preferred habitats of Lichenomphalina hudsoniana. Additionally, the fruiting bodies of N. pulchella are found to be more prevalent and larger in tropical regions compared to temperate ones, and they often do not contain soredia. This suggests that environmental factors or underlying taxonomic differences may influence the observed variations between these species in different locales.\n\n\n== Photobiont ==\nIn 1981, Elisabeth Tschermak-Woess identified Nannochloris normandinae as the photobiont partner, the algae associated with Normandina pulchella. Subsequent studies, however, have been less definitive about the role of Nannochloris. By 2011, research by Thüs and colleagues revealed that Diplosphaera, not Nannochloris, was present in  ten examined Normandina specimens. More recently, Pröschold & Darienko (2020) reclassified Nannochloris normandinae as synonymous with Diplosphaera chodatii of the order Prasiolales, further complicating the identification of the true photobiont in N. pulchella and suggesting that previous attributions to Nannochloris may be incorrect.\n\n\n== Habitat and distribution ==\n\nNormandina pulchella has a cosmopolitan distribution, growing across diverse climates and regions. The Swedish lichenologist Gunnar Degelius, in his 1934 phytogeographical study, highlights the species' oceanic distribution in Europe. It predominantly occupies coastal areas in Northern Europe, including Scandinavia and the British Isles, and extends to Austria, Bavaria, France, Czechoslovakia, and select Mediterranean locales. In contrast, William Louis Culberson and Mason Hale's 1966 analysis of its North American presence noted its prevalence in the mountainous western regions and the Appalachian foothills, without indicating an oceanic distribution pattern. Its range in North America extends north to Alaska, although in 2022 Alan Orange showed that some collections from there represent a different species found in the Americas, provisionally named N. 'americana'.\nEcologically, Normandina pulchella favours moss-covered deciduous trees and rocks within woodlands and parks, often colonising over mosses, bryophytes, and occasionally bare bark. It also often grows on other lichens, particularly those that contain cyanobacteria, such as Fuscopannaria, Pannaria, Parmeliella, Pectenia, and Peltigera. Its presence is increasing in southern and western Britain and throughout Ireland, reflecting a broadening distribution.\nIt is listed as a vulnerable in the Finnish Regional Red List because of its small known population.\n\n\n== Species interactions ==\nAmong the lichenicolous (lichen-dwelling) fungi specifically associated with Normandina pulchella are several species that have unique interactions. Capronia normandinae is characterised by its black, superficial, hair-like structures known as setose perithecia. Cladophialophora normandinae is distinguished by its black fruiting bodies, termed sporodochia, which play a role in its reproductive cycle. Additionally, Tremella normandinae is noted for producing pale, swollen growths, referred to as galls, indicative of its parasitic relationship with the lichen. Another parasite, Globosphaeria jamesii, also interacts with Normandina pulchella, further contributing to the diversity of its ecological associations. Moreover, Lawreymyces pulchellae has an endolichenic relationship, residing within the lichen's structure.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sophie Rabinoff (1899–1957) was a Jewish pediatrician, public health educator, and researcher. She was known for her contributions to the field of preventative medicine.\nSophie served as a health official in various hospitals and centers in New York including New York Department of Health and New York Medical College. She was the first female physician on house staff at Mount Sinai Beth Israel and the only female physician in the American Zionist Medical Unit in Israel during World War I.\n\n\n== Life ==\nRabinoff was born to Jewish parents Louis and Rose Rabinoff in Mogeileff, Russia on May 19, 1889. Immediately after birth, the family relocated ro New York, US.  She had a brother, George Rabinoff, and three sisters, Clara Rabinoff Carson, Jeannie Rabinoff and Eva Rabinoff Goalwin.She attended New York public schools, then Hunter College from 1906 - 1908, and then went to Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania (now Drexel University College of Medicine) receiving her medical degree in 1913. Rabinoff was the first female intern at Beth Israel Hospital in New York (now Mount Sinai Beth Israel), going on to complete a three-year residency in Pediatrics.In 1945 Rabinoff received a master's degree in public health from Columbia University. She lived at 166 East 96th street in New York City and died in 1957 at the age of 68.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== New York City ===\nIn 1913 Rabinoff became the first female intern on house staff at Mount Sinai Beth Israel (then Beth Israel Hospital) Hospital \"triumphing over thirty men in a competitive examination.\" Initially told by the hospital that women are not eligible for appointment, the hospital later agreed to allow her to sit for the examination, at which she came in first place.In 1915 Rabinoff and Dr. Alfred F. Hess attempted to prophylacticly immunize children against mumps and chickenpox at the Hebrew Infant Asylum where Rabinoff was a physician. Children who never had mumps received injections from the blood of mumps patients and were then placed in mumps wards. This experiment yielded resounding success to stem the spread of Chickenpox through vaccines and led to others copying this method including Chicago's Home for Jewish Friendless.From 1918 - 1919, she worked on the first large-scale project on the use of Diphtheria toxin, Antitoxin, and Toxoid.\nFrom 1919 - 1934, Rabinoff ran the pediatric clinic at Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan). In addition, she maintained a private medical practice specializing in Pediatrics and in the 1930s was the cardiologist for the New York Infirmary for Women and Children. In 1934, Rabinoff began working with the New York Department of Public Health, organizing health center programs on the Lower East and West side.In 1938, Rabinoff became the Health Officer for the East HarlemHealth District. In 1944 she was put in charge of the Tremont, Fordham, Riverdale district of The Bronx. One initiative she led was instituting chest X-rays for visitors to Bronx Park.In 1946, she led the campaign to reduce infant mortality in East Harlem for the New York Department of Public Health.She was also the leader of the Benjamin Franklin Community Advisory Council's Health Committee and Director of the Health Center. She was noted as a \"potent force\" for improved health and sanitation.\n\n\n=== Teaching career ===\nIn 1939 Rabinoff taught as a Clinical Instructor in public health for New York Medical College, supervising fieldwork for senior medical students. When she returned to East Harlem in 1951 to take a teaching position at Flower and Fifth Avenue Hospital.\nShe retired in June 1956 as a professor of Public Health and Industria; Medicine and Director of the Department of Public Health at New York Medical College, and died there in October 1957 at the age of 68.\n\n\n=== Israel ===\nDue to her specialized training, in June 1918, Rabinoff was selected by Henrietta Szold to join the American Zionist Medical Unit in Israel, serving with the British forces in World War I. She was the only female physician in the unit. There she helped organize hospitals and clinics for Arab and Jewish children in Jerusalem and Jaffa focusing on treating Malaria.Rabinoff returned to the United States in 1919 where she published a medical paper on her experience there, Some Experience with Malaria Among Children in Palestine, presenting it at the New York Academy of Medicine in December 1919.\n\n\n== Advocacy ==\nAfter retiring in 1956, Rabinoff continued working with the East Harlem Council for Community Planning and Public Health Committee of New York County Medical Society.Rabinoff also continued raising money for various Jewish philanthropies.\n\n\n== Awards and associations ==\nIn 1957 Rabinoff received the Achievement Award of the Alumnae Association of Woman's Medical College.\nShe was named a Diplomate of the American Board of Preventive Medicine and Public Health.\nShe was a member of the American Public Health Association, Women's Medical Association of New York City and New York State, American Medical Association, Women's City Club of New York, and New York Academy of Medicine.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "St Mary's Church is the parish church of Bolton-on-Swale, a village in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThe oldest parts of the current church are the south aisle and south doorway, which date from the early 14th century.  The chancel and vestry are 15th century, while the tower dates from about 1550.  It was heavily restored by George Fowler Jones in 1857, the work including rebuilding much of the nave, most of the windows, and replacing the roof.  The chancel was remodelled in 1877 by Eden Nesfield.  The church was grade II* listed in 1969.\nThe church is built of sandstone with Westmorland slate roofs.  It consists of a nave, north and south aisles, a chancel with a north vestry and organ chamber, and a west tower.  The tower has three stages, diagonal buttresses, a southeast stair turret, a three-light west window, a clock face on the west side, two-light bell openings, with cinquefoil heads, continuous decorated lintels and hood moulds, and an embattled parapet with coats of arms.\nInside the church is a 14th-century piscina, in the south aisle.  The sanctuary has decorative tiles made by Nesfield with a mural above depicting angels ascending to Heaven, while the Carpenter chapel has similar tiling, with bas relief plasterwork depicting maritime and pastoral scenes from the Bible.  In the south wall are part of four Mediaeval tomb slabs, while next to the pulpit is part of an Anglo-Danish cross shaft.  There is a large black marble slab commemorating Henry Jenkins, who died at the supposed age of 169.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGrade II* listed buildings in North Yorkshire\nListed buildings in Bolton-on-Swale\n\n\n== References ==",

It is the band's first album in eight years, since the release of Here Come the Rattling Trees in 2016. \n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nHey Panda received a score of 89 out of 100 on review aggregator Metacritic based on five critics' reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Uncut called it \"beautifully now\", while Mojo wrote that it \"may seem whimsical at first, but its depth is all the grander for the work it takes to mine its many gems\". MusicOMH's Steven Johnson stated that Hey Panda \"reinforces the view that O'Hagan is a special composer and bandleader of note. It sees him push himself creatively further than he's ever done to date, delivering a unique, fascinating, compelling album in the process\".\nRyan Dillon of Glide Magazine felt that \"these twelve songs carry the weight of time as it feels like we are reintroduced to the band despite their storied tenure as pop's most unpredictable offering strikes again with ambitious concepts executed to the highest order\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Samuel Charters Macpherson  (7 January 1806 – 15 April 1860) was a Scottish political agent in India.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMacpherson was born in Old Aberdeen on 7 January 1806. He was the elder brother of John Macpherson and William Macpherson. He was also the second son of Dr. Hugh Macpherson, professor of Greek in King's College, Aberdeen, by his first wife, Anne Maria Charters. After studying at the college of Edinburgh in 1822–3, he passed two years at Trinity College, Cambridge, returned to Edinburgh to study for the Scottish bar, and, finding his eyes too weak, finally sailed for Madras as a cadet in 1827, becoming lieutenant in 1831, and captain by, brevet in 1841. He was first engaged on the trigonometrical surrey of India, out in 1835 was summoned to join his regiment (the 8th native infantry)'c which was engaged in operations against the rajah of Qumsur in Onssa. In 1837 he was sent by the collector of Ganjam on a mission of survey and inquiry into the unexplored parts of Gumsur. Here he obtained much information respecting the language and institutions of the Khonds, a wild aboriginal tribe then almost unknown. In May 1839 he was compelled by fever to recruit at the Cape. On his return to Madras he drew up for the governor-general (Lord Elphinstone) a report on the Khonds, and the measures to be adopted for the suppression among that people of the Meriah, or human sacrifices. This report formed the basis of a paper which he read before the Royal Asiatic Society in 1852. In the meantime, Captain (afterwards General) Campbell, assistant to the collector of Ganjam, had called together the chief men of the Khonds of Gumsur, and informed them that human sacrifices would no longer be tolerated by the company's government, and had compelled them to give up a number of intended victims. But neither Campbell nor his superior, Bannerman, made any real progress in suppressing the rite. In the spring of 1842, Campbell having gone to China on service with his regiment, Macpherson was appointed principal assistant to the collector and agent in Ganjam. His knowledge of the people and the influence he had acquired over them by personal intercourse enabled him to lay down a system for abolishing their barbarous practices. He administered justice among them with unflagging industry; he strove to conciliate the curate, priests, and rajahs; he vigorously punished the Hindus who carried on the nefarious traffic of supplying victims to the Khonds ; he constructed roads, encouraged fairs, and bestowed the Meriah girls in marriage on the most influential persons among the tribes, and made these alliances a passport to the favour of fovernment. The result was that on 15 February 1844 he was able to write: 'The whole of the Gumsur Khond country ... is completely conquered, and by the use of moral influences alone.'\nIn the districts adjoining Gumsur he was less successful. The jealousy of his colleagues blocked his way. Bannerman, the collector of Gumsur, appears to have thwarted him, and the Madras government temporised, and gave Macpherson no efficient support. A Hindu, who had been appointed Zamindar's agent for Khond affairs, was secretly encouraging the Meriah sacrifices, and thus enriching himself with bribes. He obtained the support of Macpherson's superiors, and when in November 1845 Macpherson, having been appointed ' governor-general's agent for the suppression of Meriah sacrifice and female infanticide in the hill tracts of Orissa,' proceeded to extend his measures to Boad, a district north of Gumsur, the Hindu's sons raised a rebellion and attacked the camp of the agent. Macpherson was thus compelled to resort to coercive measures ; but Bannerman withheld the assistance of troops. The Madras government, too, sent to the disturbed districts a brigadier-general, with the power of superseding Macpherson— a power of which he instantly availed himself; and not content with that, he not only ordered Macpherson and his assistants, and everybody connected with his agency, to withdraw from the country, but summarily dismissed the native officers from the public service. Colonel Campbell, the old rival and opponent of Macpherson, was then appointed agent in his place, and charges were sent in against him, which, after an inquiry lasting a year and a half, were declared by the commissioner, Mr. (afterwards Sir) John Peter Grant, appointed to investigate them, to be unfounded. Meanwhile, the measures adopted by Macpherson for the suppression of the insurrection had already borne fruit ; and the brigadier-general had little difficulty in crushing the enemy. Lord Dalhousie, who was now governor-general, declared that nothing could compensate Macpherson for the treatment he had undergone.\nIn August 1853 Macpherson returned to India from sick-leave to Europe. He was appointed in succession agent at Benares and at Bhopal, but in July 1854, being then brevet-major, he was transferred to the more important post of Gwalior, the capital of Sindhia, the most powerful native ruler in Central India. The agent, Sir Robert North Hamilton, supported Macpherson's policy in everything. Sindhia's minister, Dinkar Rao, was a statesman of the first order; and Macpherson took care that his administrative genius should have free play. He abolished the transit duties; laid out large sums on the roads and public works; drew up a capital code of law and civil procedure, and raised the revenue from a deficit to a surplus.\nMacpherson's support of Dinkar was repaid with interest. When the Sipahi mutinies broke out in 1857, it was Dinkar, influenced by Macpherson, who kept the Gwalior contingent and Sindhia's own army from joining the rebels in Delhi. Macpherson lived to see the mutiny suppressed; but the strain upon his health had teen too great. In April 1860 he was seized with illness, and died, on his way to Calcutta, on 15 April. After his death he was gazetted a companion of the Bath.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Goodwin, Gordon (1893). \"Macpherson, Samuel Charters\".

        "content": "Božidar \"Božo\" Vidoeski (8 November 1920 – 16 May 1998; Macedonian: Божидар \"Божо\" Видоески) was a Macedonian linguist and the founder of Macedonian dialectology.\n\n\n== Life ==\nBožidar Vidoeski was born on 8 November 1920 in Zvečan, Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. After studying in Prilep, Kragujevac and Skopje, he studied Russian philology at the Belgrade University under Serbian linguist Aleksandar Belić. During the World War II in Yugoslav Macedonia, he supported the Serbian Chetnik movement of Draža Mihajlović, and at the end of the war he switched to the side of the Yugoslav partisans. Afterwards Vidoeski studied Macedonian philology at the Skopje University under Macedonian linguist Blaže Koneski. He graduated in 1949 from Skopje and immediately became an assistant at the Department of Macedonian and South Slavic languages there. After that year, he was also the author of a number of articles and monographs on Macedonian dialectology and comparative Slavic philology. In 1950, he was one of the founders of the journal Makedonski jazik (Macedonian Language), as well as its editor from 1973 to his death. In 1953 he was a researcher at the Krste Misirkov Institute for the Macedonian Language in Skopje, where he later founded and directed the dialectology and onomastics sections. In 1957, he obtained his doctorate under Koneski. In 1958/1959, Vidoeski specialized in Slavic philology at Warsaw University and taught Macedonian language courses in Warsaw and Cracow. He later became a professor at the St. Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje. Along with Koneski, he was active in international Slavist networks.His geographical placement of the Macedonian dialects in dialectological maps was resented in Bulgarian academic circles, who noted that the dialectal area presented by him, entered deep into Bulgarian, Greek and Albanian territory. They accused Vidoeski of having plagiarized the bibliographical works of M. Mazhdrakova (1905), Hr. Gerchev (1911) and St. Stoykov (1937) under the title \"Appendix to the Bibliography of the Macedonian Language\" (1953). He became a member of the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts in 1974. In the 1980s, he was an editor of the dictionary Osnoven sistem (Basic system), about Slavic onomastics. Vidoeski retired in 1986. He died on 16 May 1998 in Sremska Kamenica, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. After his death, in 2013, Bulgarian researcher Georgi Mitrinov criticized him for having falsified the data about the Bulgarian population in Macedonia from Bulgarian ethnographer Vasil Kanchov by replacing the ethnonym \"Bulgarians\" with \"Macedonians\" in his work Фонолошки бази на говорите на македонскиот јазик (Phonological bases of the dialects of the Macedonian language).\n\n\n== See also ==\nMacedonian studies\nHistoriography in North Macedonia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSloboden Pecat's article about Božidar Vidoeski (in Albanian)\nSloboden Pecat's article about Božidar Vidoeski (in Macedonian)\nSloboden Pecat's article about Božidar Vidoeski (in Serbian)\nBibliography from MANU",

        "content": "National Audit Office (abbreviated NAO, Finnish: Valtiontalouden tarkastusvirasto (VTV)) oversees the management of public finances in Finland and monitors fiscal policies as well as election and party funding. It operates as the supreme external auditor in connection with the Parliament. Independent audit work ensures that state funds are used in accordance with the decisions of the Parliament, lawfully and effectively, and that financial policy is managed in a sustainable manner. The tasks of the NAO are defined in the Finnish Constitution. \nThe Parliament appoints the Director General of the National Audit Office for a term of six years. Since January 2022, the Director General of the Audit Office has been Sami Yläoutinen. At the end of 2022, the office had 145 employees. The main office of the agency is located in Helsinki, with another office in Oulu. The office premises in Helsinki have been located in Ruoholahti since 2017 at Porkkalankatu 1.\nThe National Audit Office's area of operation includes the Government and ministries, state agencies and institutions, funds outside the state budget, state-owned enterprises and companies, grants and subsidies to municipalities, businesses, and other organizations, as well as transfers between Finland and the European Union. The Audit Office does not audit the finances of the Parliament, funds under the responsibility of the Parliament, the Bank of Finland, or the Social Insurance Institution of Finland.\n\n\n== History ==\nDuring the Swedish rule in Finland, a governmental agency named Kamarirevisio was established in 1695 to oversee the Crown's financial administration. Its name was changed to Kamarioikeus in 1799. At the beginning of the autonomy of Finland, supervision of state taxation and auditing belonged to the Senate's Chamber Office, which established the revisiokonttori for this purpose. By the Senate's regulation, an independent agency named Yleinen revisionioikeus was established on December 16, 1824, which included the revisiokonttori. The agency was led by a commissioner. Its task was to audit the state accounts, and the role of the court was to handle any detected abuses and to bring possible charges. The revisionioikeus was eventually transferred from the Chamber Office to the State Treasury Office.\nThe name of the agency was shortened by a new regulation issued on December 29, 1923, to Yleinen revisionilaitos. The revision court continued under its authority until it was replaced in 1931 by a board of revision.\nThe Act on the Audit of State Finances was passed on December 23, 1947, and the National Audit Office began its operations the following year. According to the law, the National Audit Office was tasked with auditing the legality and appropriateness of state financial management and overseeing the implementation of the budget, which remain its main tasks to this day. The general accounting of the state and the preparation of the state financial statements were transferred to the State Treasury by a regulation issued on April 14, 1965. The tasks of the NAO were expanded in 1993 to include the supervision of the State Guarantee Fund and, along with it, bank support, and in 1995 the supervision of financial transfers between Finland and the European Union. Since 2001, the National Audit Office has operated as an independent agency under the Parliament, separate from the Ministry of Finance, as the Constitution, which entered into force in 2000, required the agency to be functionally independent. The supervision of party funding was transferred from the Ministry of Justice to the NAO from the beginning of 2016.\nThe Parliamentary Ombudsman issued a reprimand in December 2020 to the Director General of the NAO, Tytti Yli-Viikari, and to the Director in charge of legal affairs, Mikko Koiranen. The reprimand concerned the fact that Yli-Viikari and Koiranen had concluded an agreement in the spring of 2016, whereby a senior inspector at the agency was paid full salary without any work obligation for the second half of 2016 and half salary from the beginning of 2017 to the end of July 2018.\n\n\n== Organization ==\nThe National Audit Office is led by the Director General, elected by the Parliament for a six-year term. The Director General approves the audit plan and decides on the reports and audit instructions to be submitted to the Parliament.\n\nThe National Audit Office consists of three units: the Audit Unit, the Oversight Unit, and the Shared Services Unit.\nThe Audit Unit is responsible for conducting financial, performance, and compliance audits. The unit is led by Jaakko Eskola.\nThe Oversight Unit is responsible for monitoring party and election funding, maintaining the transparency register, handling complaints and reports of misconduct, and conducting financial policy audits. Additionally, it oversees financial policy independently from the rest of the agency. The unit is led by Matti Okko.\nThe Shared Services Unit provides personnel, financial, and information technology services, communication, office facilities, case management, and other common services of the agency. The unit is led by Tuula Sandholm.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Giorgio Roster (May 20, 1843 – January 17, 1927) was an Italian scientist and photographer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGiorgio Roster was born on May 20, 1843 in Florence, Italy. He studied medicine and surgery at the University of Pisa, where he graduated in 1864, and then worked as an assistant to Serafino Capezzuoli at the Institute of Physio-Pathological Chemistry of the Institute of Higher Studies in Florence.\nRoster's studies on chemistry and hygiene led him abroad for extended periods, especially to German-speaking countries, where he could deepen his knowledge: in Zürich under the guidance of Johannes Wislicenus, in Strasbourg with Felix Hoppe Seyler, and in Munich with Max Joseph von Pettenkofer.\nAppointed as a professor of hygiene in 1878 and of physiological and pathological chemistry in 1881, Roster, between 1885 and 1889, conducted numerous researches on air, water, and soil in Florence, for which he set up his own chemistry laboratory.\nFrom 1886 to 1895, Roster was a member of the commission established by the Municipality of Florence for the control of drinking water, and for about thirty years, he was a member of the Provincial Health Council. The results of his analyses led him to advocate for a radical improvement in the hygienic-sanitary conditions of the citizens of Florence: the analyses on the quality and purity of the water conducted in his laboratory were indeed negative and led him to request immediate intervention from the authorities.\nTo these types of research were added Roster's many other interests: botany, mineralogy, and photography. Each of these fields of study saw him engaged in research activities, resulting in over two hundred publications bearing his name, including monographs and articles published in specialized journals.\nThe long summer periods that Roster spent at Villa dell'Ottonella near Portoferraio, on the Island of Elba, since 1875, were fundamental for his mineralogical and botanical research: thus arose a mineralogical museum, later merged into the Museum of Natural History of Florence, also thanks to his close relationship with Raffaello Foresi, and an acclimatization garden for exotic plants created, starting from 1895, at the same villa.\nIn the field of photography, especially in relation to its multiple applications in the scientific field, Roster was a great experimenter, ranging from photomicrographs, made with an instrument he himself devised for cytological, anatomical, and entomological studies, to telephotographs, executed with a telephoto lens once again adapted by him to represent objects at different distances, to the filming of solar spots. This great passion led him to publish numerous essays in specialized journals and earned him the presidency of the Italian Photographic Society of Florence, a position he held from 1890 to 1894, as well as important awards at national and international photography exhibitions.\nIn 1896, he was appointed Officer of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus for his use of telephotography in military reconnaissance. The camera used for this purpose by Roster is permanently exhibited at the museum of the Military Geographic Institute of Florence.\n\n\n== The Roster Library and Archive ==\nIn his life as a scientist and photographer, Giorgio Roster collected a rich library and produced an extensive documentary and photographic archive.\n\nA large part of Roster's private library, totaling about 1400 volumes for 1050 titles, is deposited at the Foresiana Municipal Library of Portoferraio. The archival material is instead distributed among various institutions: the Museo Nazionale Alinari della Fotografia, where 1964 images attributable to Roster are preserved, including negative plates and glass slides, the latter kept in their original boxes, in addition to other boxes of various photographers purchased for educational and study purposes; the State Artistic Lyceum of Porta Romana and Sesto Fiorentino, where 38 photographic plates are located, as well as three handwritten booklets titled by Roster Catalogo delle negative; the Foresiana Municipal Library and Pinacoteca of Portoferraio, where photographs, telephotographs, stereographs, and photomicrographs accompanied by handwritten sheets with related technical annotations are preserved; the botany section of the Museum of Natural History at the University of Florence, which houses two collections of plant specimens, 545 glass negatives, still mostly in their original boxes, and 95 photographic prints; the library of the Museo Galileo, where about 50 handwritten documents, about 250 photographs, microphotographs, and telephotographs, and 140 photographic plates, also accompanied by autographed technical annotations, are preserved. The deposits of the Museo Galileo also include a complete camera with tripod and a series of lenses donated by the Roster family.\nThe mineralogy section of the Museum of Natural History at the University of Florence preserves Giorgio Roster's mineralogical collection, accompanied by the manuscript catalogs he created himself.\n\n\n== Works ==\nRoster, Giorgio (1897).

        "title": "The Salvage Crew",
        "revision_id": 1216988313,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The Salvage Crew is a 2020 English-language science fiction novel by Sri Lankan author Yudhanjaya Wijeratne. The author notably used artificial intelligence to construct some of the elements in the novel, including the poetry spoken by the novel's protagonist.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe UN ship Damn Right I Ate the Apple crashed during an attempt to colonize the uninhabited planet Urmagon Beta. Decades later, the UN hires Planetary Crusade Services (PCS) to salvage the ship's parts.\nAmber Rose 348 is a digitized human owned by PCS. Amber Rose is the overseer (“OC”) of a salvage crew including Simon, a geologist; Anna, a physician, and Milo, an engineer. OC is feels that they are underqualified for a salvage mission, referring to them as a “D team”. The crew lands on Urmagon Beta. OC directs the crew and writes poetry in his spare time. While exploring, they find hostile alien fauna. They also note another ship in orbit, presumably from Mercer Corps, a group of transhumanist mercenaries.\nOC finds an injured Mercer, who attacks the crew. Simon shoots and kills her. Simon is infected with micromachines; OC is forced to trigger an EMP, which slows the infection but destroys most of the crew's advanced technology. OC asks for help from PCS, but a manager tells OC that help would be out of budget and that letting the crew die will be cheaper. OC resolves to complete the salvage mission and return with all three crew members alive.\nThe crew has several hostile encounters with Mercers. The salvage job is completed. OC reactivates an android named Shen, found with the corpses of the original colonists. Shen is not a sentient AI, but is able to help with basic tasks. Their ship is attacked by the Mercer spaceship, delaying their extraction from the planet. Conditions deteriorate during the interim. Simon's condition worsens. Anna and Milo fight constantly, and food begins running low. Shen is captured by a Mercer, which is controlled by an alien intelligence.\nSimon commits suicide. Milo is shot and killed by a Mercer. Shen, controlled by the alien, returns and communicates with OC. The alien identifies itself as Beacon and explains its philosophy: creatures can be divided into the classes of functional flesh, literary flesh, functional machine, and literary machine. Beacon considers that contacting any civilization other than literary machines would be a waste of time, as they are not sufficiently advanced. Beacon identifies OC and other digitized humans as examples of literary machines based on their ability to write poetry; it wishes to initiate first contact.\nBeacon places OC's consciousness inside the PCS ship. OC and Anna return to their home system and share the truth about PCS's unethical business practices. Beacon sends OC and Anna to another world to meet more advanced intelligences.\n\n\n== Major themes ==\nUmang Poddar of the Mithila Review writes that the author's use of AI during the creation of the novel is relevant to the novel's themes of human-AI coexistence. The crew members and OC are in conflict due to their different roles, which \"shows a ‘machine v. human’ divide, where the machine is breathing down their necks, monitoring all their activities, while the humans need a celebration every now and then.\" Poddar writes that \"a sense of unfettered greed which has expanded over the breadth of the universe.\" For example, PCS will only give insurance coverage if at least 70% of the salvage target is recovered. Poddar finds that several situations in the novel are analogous to working for modern-day corporations such as Amazon, where workers \"are expected match the speed of the computers, making their lives miserable.\"\nEric Hendel of Strange Horizons writes that a general theme of the novel is the danger of commodifying human life. In one scene, Amber Rose discusses his crew with another AI, which states that PCS would be better off financially if the crew members died.\n\n\n== Style ==\nThe majority of the story is narrated from the perspective of Amber Rose 348. Wijeratne rendered all of Amber Rose's spoke dialogue in capital letters. According to a review in Strange Horizons, \"even when Amber's narration is presented to the reader in natural language, his every interaction with the book's human characters ... conveys the disorienting sense that everything is said via a shout at full volume.\"\n\n\n== Background ==\nWijeratne used artificial intelligence to create parts of the novel. Urmagon Beta was created by using the Zarkonnen planet generator, which is \"a software that basically keeps spitting out bespoke planets with various qualities, which you can download from a website.\" The poems in the novel were constructed with GPT-2, and open-source AI. Additionally, the author used a collection of Python scripts \"to generate a string of random events in his plot—everything from sudden changes in the weather to disagreements that might arise between the book’s characters\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\nGautam Bhatia of Himal Southasian writes that \"The Salvage Crew reads like a love letter to science fiction. And, like the best of love letters, it is layered and has dimensions, communicating its message at many levels.\" Bhatia writes that The Salvage Crew is in \"direct conversation\" with Peter Watts's 2006 novel Blindsight as both novels reflect on themes of intelligence, identity, and consciousness. Bhatia also writes that the novel's most direct predecessor is the 1961 novel Solaris, which similarly features a team of three crew members \"attempting to understand – and communicate with – a vast, intelligent ocean that projects their own fear and guilt back at them.\"\nBhatia furthermore comments that The Salvage Crew is \"one of the most riotously intertextual genre novels today\". Several paragraphs in the novel allude the science fiction works of Joe Haldeman, Ridley Scott, and Philip K. Dick,  among others. Bhatia states that \"even non-SF geeks would enjoy [these easter eggs] because it is so clear that Wijeratne is having fun himself – these references are often snuck in as ironic asides, with gentle ribbing of the genre's classics.\" Wijeratne does not limit himself to science fiction, also quoting William Shakespeare, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Alfred, Lord Tennyson. This reflects the \"'hybrid' nature of growing up in the post-colony (especially the Southasian post-colony), where an individual is equally exposed to the myths and legends of their own culture and to the canon of Anglophone classics (whether literary or SF).\"\nJaideep Unudutri of The Hindu wrote that the novel is \"space opera for the gig economy, where the “cost of doing business” is the limitation, not something old-fashioned like the speed of light.\" Umang Poddar of the Mithila Review praised the novel's exploration of capitalism, language games, and artificial intelligences. Poddar noted that \"this is the kind of book which makes for a great re-read as you are better able to connect snippets of the final idea scattered through the book\". The same review wished for more development among the secondary characters, feeling that \"their personalities were conveniently shaped to fit into the plot\".\nEric Hendel of Strange Horizons wrote that the novel's themes take a sharp turn in the final chapters, and that \"Wijeratne’s attempt to shift the focus, near the novel’s end, to an entirely new subject produces a dissonance in the narrative that cannot be reconciled.\" Nevertheless, the review states that \"despite my problems with the ending, The Salvage Crew does still represent a fascinating experiment by an author deeply invested in probing the basic nature of narrative itself.\"\n\n\n== References ==",
