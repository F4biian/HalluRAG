        "content": "Naitō Masayoshi (内藤政義, March 3, 1820 - November 18, 1888),  was the 7th lord of the Nobeoka Domain in Hyuga Province. He belonged to the Naitō clan, which was the main branch of the Nobeoka Domain and had a lineage of 12 generations.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThe fifteenth son of the lord of Hikone Domain, Ii Naonaka. He was born on March 3, 1820, and his original name after coming of age in Hikone was Naoyasu. In July of 1834, he accompanied his brother Naosuke (the third son of Naonaka) to Edo at his invitation. This was because Naoyasu had been nominated as a potential adoptive candidate for the heir of Naitō Masaaki, the lord of Nobeoka Domain, who had no heir. As a result, Naoyasu, who was chosen, entered into an adoptive relationship with Masayoshi and changed his name to Masayoshi. On the other hand, Naosuke returned to Hikone in August of the following year and became a long-term resident of a room. On October 13, 1834, following the death of his adoptive father Masaaki, he succeeded to the family headship. In December of the same year, he was appointed to the position of Noto-no-kami (Governor of Noto) with the rank of Jugoi (Junior Fifth Rank). In terms of domain administration, he engaged in various reforms such as relief measures for successive famines in 1841 and 1848, military and educational reforms, and new land development. In 1850, he renamed the domain school Gakuryo to \"Kogyokan\". On October 24, 1862, he retired and handed over the family headship to his adopted son Masataka. He died at the age of 69 on November 18, 1888.\n\n\n== Family Genealogy ==\nIi Naonaka (real father)\nNaito Masayu (adoptive father)\nThe lawful wife, the joint room\nToyohime, Kikuhime -\n\nMizoguchi Naoryo's third daughter\nPrincess Toyoko\nTachibana Akikata's daughter\nAdopted child\n\nNaitō Masatake - The sixth son of Ota Sukehame\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of han\nNobeoka Domain\nAbolition of the han system\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Swainsona microphylla, commonly known as small-leaf swainson-pea, small-leaf swainsona, or poison swainson-pea is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae and is endemic to mainland Australia. It is a prostrate or low-growing, sometimes erect perennial herb, with imparipinnate leaves with mostly 21 to 41 broadly wedge-shaped to round leaflets and racemes of 5 to 10 white, pink or purple flowers.\n\n\n== Description ==\nSwainsona microphylla is a prostrate or low-growing, sometimes erect perennial herb that typically grows to a height of up to 60 cm (24 in) long and sometimes has softly-hairy branches. The leaves are imparipinnate, mostly 50–150 mm (2.0–5.9 in) long with mostly broadly wedge-shaped to round leaflets, the leaflets 1–5 mm (0.039–0.197 in) long and wide with stipules 1–4 mm (0.039–0.157 in) long at the base of the petioles. The flowers are white, pink or purple, arranged in racemes of 10 to 25, on a peduncle 10–30 mm (0.39–1.18 in) wide, each flower 6–10 mm (0.24–0.39 in) long on a pedicel 1–2 mm (0.039–0.079 in) long. The sepals are joined at the base to form a tube about 1 mm (0.039 in) long, with teeth much shorter than the tube. The standard petal is 6–8 mm (0.24–0.31 in) long and 6–9 mm (0.24–0.35 in) wide, the wings 6–7 mm (0.24–0.28 in) long and the keel 4.5–7 mm (0.18–0.28 in) long and 2–3 mm (0.079–0.118 in) broad. The fruit is an almost spherical pod 5–10 mm (0.20–0.39 in) long and 3–9 mm (0.12–0.35 in) wide with the remains of the style 2–4 mm (0.079–0.157 in) long.\n\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\nSwainsona microphylla was first formally described in 1854 by Asa Gray in the United States Exploring Expedition Phanerogamia. The specific epithet (microphylla) means \"small-leaved\".\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThis species of pea grows in sandy soils on sandplains and sand hills, and is found in all mainland Australian states and the Northern Territory. In Victoria, it is mainly restricted to the far north-west of that state. In New South Wales, it is found on the western slopes and plains. In Western Australia it is widespread in inland areas. In South Australia, the species is widespread in scattered areas and in the Northern Territory it occurs in the south.\n\n\n== References ==",

Fourteen members of a new council were elected from among 20 candidates, with Sheikh Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah subsequently granting recognition to the body as the Legislative Council.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Majlis movement began in early 1938 when a group of businessmen began calling for political reforms, including better public services and greater public participation in government. In late February an activist was publicly flogged after being accused of graffiti and anti-government propaganda. Despite reassurances that the accomplices he had named were not under threat of any action, several people fled to Iraq. An underground movement subsequently developed and published its proposals for reform in the Iraqi Az-Zaman newspaper on 3 April. After the proposals received support from other Iraqi newspapers, the sheikh wrote a letter to the Iraqi press telling them to cease interfering in Kuwaiti affairs.\nDue to the unrest, the British Political Agent Gerald de Gaury was authorised to suggest to the sheikh that a council be created. Although the proposal was initially rejected, agitation from businessmen increased after they found out about the British advice. The sheikh also faced pressure from within his family, with his cousin Crown Prince Abdullah Al-Salim Al-Sabah reportedly providing de Gaury with a copy of an agreement between the sheikh and prominent families in which he had promised to form a council if he was elected sheikh.\n\n\n== Results ==\nOn 29 June, three leading businessmen formally requested the sheikh create an elected council. On the same day, heads of 150 prominent families met to elect the members of the council, with 14 elected from among 20 candidates.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe elected members met at the Mejlis on 4 July and demanded the sheikh recognise the new council. After initially trying to undermine it by attempting unsuccessfully to offer privileges to members who would defect, he consented on 6 July and recognised it as the Legislative Council. Crown Prince Abdullah was elected speaker.\nHowever, the British felt that the powers given by the sheikh to the council were too broad, particularly making it responsible for approving foreign treaties and giving the speaker executive authority. A meeting was arranged with de Gaury, the sheikh, the Political Resident of the Persian Gulf and some members of the council on 15 October, at which it was agreed that the sheikh would have sole responsibility for negotiating and signing foreign agreements, but that they needed approval by the council to become law.\nTensions between the council and the sheikh and political agent soon came to a head, with the sheikh unhappy with the council dismissing his chief secretary Abdullah Saleh Al Mulla (who had effectively been the country's government for four decades) and the British unhappy with the council attempting to take control of revenue from oil. The sheikh dissolved the council on 21 December and called fresh elections.\n\n\n== References ==",

The IPF is itself a recognised member of SportAccord, the successor organisation to the Global Association of International Sports Federations.\nAustralia is also a member of the IPF's Oceania region, and as such the APA is recognised as a member of the Oceania Regional Powerlifting Federation (ORPF).\nAustralia is a member of the Commonwealth, and as such the APA is a member of the Commonwealth Powerlifting Federation (CPF).\n\n\n== Competitions and representation ==\n\n\n=== First local competition ===\nThe first competition hosted by the APA was the \"Real McCloy Bench Press Only\", held at Penrith NSW on 17 February 2024.\n\n\n=== First National Competition ===\nThe Australian Powerlifting Union did not host a national championship in 2023, meaning lifters had no pathway for qualification for international events in 2024. As a result, the APA scheduled the 2024 national championships earlier in the year to facilitate qualification for international events. Specific eligibility criteria were established for 2024 noting that the organisation had no history and lifters were moving into the APA from other federations. The first national competition was the 2024 National Series: Open Classic held at Newcastle, NSW on 01-03 March 2024. 137 lifters across all genders and weight classes participated.\n\n\n=== First international team ===\nThe first APA team to represent Australia at an international competition will consist of 13 lifters (5 women and 8 men), to compete at the 2024 IPF World Bench Press Championships held at Austin Texas on 21 May -  1 June 2024.\n\n\n== International competition ==\nAs a member of the IPF, the ORPF and the Commonwealth Powerlifting Federation (CPF), athletes in the APA may participate in regional and international competitions including:\n\nIPF World Classic Championships\nIPF World Equipped Championships\nIPF Junior (14-23) Championships\nIPF Masters (40+) Championships\nOceania Regional Championships\nCommonwealth Championships\nThe Arnold Sports Festival\nThe FISU University Games\n\n\n== See also ==\nWomen's powerlifting in Australia\nPowerlifting\nAustralian Masters Games\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAustralian Powerlifting Alliance\nInternational Powerlifting Federation\nOceania Regional Powerlifting Federation\nCommonwealth Powerlifting Federation",

Harris (December 18, 1935 – November 29, 1996) is an American politician who was a Republican in the Virginia House of Delegates.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHarris was born to an Episcopalian family on December 18, 1935, in Joplin, Missouri, and later moved to Fairfax, Virginia. He graduated from George Washington University with a BA, and later graduated from the USA Nuclear Reactor Engineering School. He served as a member of the Army Nuclear Power Program for 5.5 years.Harris began his political career as a Republican in the Virginia House of Delegates in 1974 from Virginia's 8th congressional district after winning the Republican nomination against John F. Herrity. He served until his death in office on November 29, 1996, of leukemia, at the age of 60. He was buried on December 2. Fairfax City Democratic chairman Austin Morrill posthumously accused Harris of misleading Democrats into thinking he was recovering, as he wrote a letter saying he was.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Leucochrysum alpinum, commonly known as alpine sunray, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.  It is a small, clumping perennial with grey leaves, white flower-heads and is endemic to Australia.\n\n\n== Description ==\nLeucochrysum alpinum is a perennial herb to about 50 cm (20 in) high and leaves that are woolly and whitish. The white flower heads are 2–5 cm (0.79–1.97 in) in diameter, outer involucral bracts oblong or oval-shaped, mostly purplish or brownish, sessile and florets yellow. Flowering occurs from December to February and the fruit is an egg-shaped achene 2–3 mm (0.079–0.118 in) long, smooth to almost warty, bristly and brown.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nLeucochrysum alpinum was first described in 1859 by Ferdinand von Mueller who gave it the name Helipterum incanum var. alpinum. In 2010 R.J.Dennis & Neville Grant Walsh changed the name to Leucochrysum alpinum and the description was published in Muelleria.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nAlpine sunray grows at higher altitudes and in subalpine heath and grasslands mostly on shallow soils in New South Wales and Victoria.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Soyuz Sever, also spelled Soyuz Siber, (translates to Soyuz north), was an early (1959–1962) design of the Soyuz spacecraft. The Soyuz Sever design of a crewed spacecraft started the Soyuz programme. In 1956, the Soyuz Sever spacecraft was proposed as the replacement for the Vostok spacecraft. Vostok spacecraft had only a crew of one; the Soyuz Sever plan would have crew of three. Sever was planned to be launched on a R7 rocket or Vostok rocket. The Sever plans were made by the Experimental Design Bureau (OKB-1) of the Soviet Union. While the Sever spacecraft was never built and launched, many of the designs and testing outcomes became part of the first generation Soyuz spacecraft, Soyuz 7K-OK and the Soyuz 1 mission launched on 23 April 1967. Sever (Sever ferry) final plan was to take crews to a Sever space station, OS-1962.\n\n\n== Design ==\nOn 1 Mach 1959 the first proposal of, OKB-1's engineer, Konstantin Feoktistov was for Sever to be twice as large as the final Soyuz spacecraft. The larger size was so Sever could be part of the Soviet future lunar program, the L4-1960 crewed lunar orbiter proposal. This was change so Sever would become a small (Soyuz size) three crewed spacecraft, by August 1959. In 1961, OKB-1 has several new designs for a three-man spacecraft: Sever, and competing esigns: Sever L1-1960 became crewed obiter Soyuz-A, Soyuz-B (orbital tug), Soyuz-V, and Vostok-Zh/Vostok-7. The one of Sever designs would use a lifting body for lift off Earth to reduce crew G forces, as The Spaceship Company does and land more like the Space Shuttle. In 1961, Sever was still a part of the future lunar program. Other plans for Soyuz Sever was a manned orbital space tug version, so spacecraft could be assembled in low earth orbit. This could be used as step to the moon. The assembled craft would have five rocket boosters assembled together to give enough power to go the moon. This plan was not taken up. The plan did developed Sever into two versions: one with one solar array and one with two solar arrays, the version that is in Soyuz. In 1961 Konstantin Vershinin, commander-in-chief of the Soviet Air Force, setup new requirements for the next generation spacecraft: crew of 2 cosmonauts, launch mass of 5896 to 6350 kg, able to manoeuvre at altitudes of 270 km to 300 km, restartable engines, 15 to 20 days duration, redundant communication radios, in a pressurized re-entry space capsule. Soviet engineer, Vladimir Chelomey, was still pushing for the was lifting body spaceplane, but his plan was rejected. On 10 February 1962 a mockup-prototype of the Sever spacecraft with two crew members was completed and a 15-day test was started. The test was planned and led by chief spacecraft designer, Grigoriy Ivanovich Voronin at GKNII in Akhtubinsk. The 1962 proposal included L1-1962, a crewed lunar flyby spacecraft. The some of the 1962 L1-1962 proposal became part of the Soyuz spacecraft.\n\n\n== Designated Sever proposals ==\nSome of the Sever proposals were formalized and given designated projects numbers:\n\nL1-1960 Sever crewed circumlunar spacecraft proposal from  1960. This became the Soyuz-A design. L1-1960 was proposed by Sergei Korolev in January 1960. The L1-1960 was a planned three crewed 5,000 to 6,000 kg spacecraft that loop around the moon and then back to earth in 1964, as Apollo 8 did in 1968. L1-1960 would used the N1 rocket that started planning in May 1961.\nL4-1960 Sever crewed lunar orbiter proposal from 1960 with a gross mass of 12,000 kg, proposed by Korolev in January 1960.  The L4-1960 lunar orbiter would be two times the size of L1-1960. L4-1960 would also used the N1 rocket. The L4-1960 would have payload of 6,000 to 8,000 kg.\nL1-1962 Sever crewed lunar flyby spacecraft proposal from 1962, some of design used in finial Soyuz.  L1-1962 was planned lunar flyby spacecraft from 1962. In L1-1962 a Vostok-Zh crews, cosmonaut assemblymen, space tug would assemble three rocket stages, rocket blocks (RB), in orbit. On top of the rocket stages would be the Soyuz Sever L1 to travel to the moon. Status: Study 1962. The L1-1962  had a gross mass of 16,500 kg. Vostok-Zh was also planned to be the craft to assemble the Sever spacestation, OS-1962. With Sever to be the ferry craft to take crews to and from the spacesttion.\n\n\n== OS-1962 space station ==\nPart of the Sever project was the planning of a manned space station, the OS-1962 design plan (Orbital Station 1962). Korolev approved the OS-1962 project called the \"Complex docking of spacecraft in earth orbit - Soyuz\" on 10 March 1962.  The plan also included the L1-1960, circumlunar spacecraft proposal project. The OS-1962 space station plan called for station with a gross mass of 13,500 kg. The OS-1962 plan first had the large spacecraft, which was later reduced by half. The space station was to be placed in orbit with three R-7 rocket launches and Vostok-7 spacecraft. OS-1962 was to be a platform for earth observation. The OS-1962 space station would have ZhO living section, the BAA scientific apparatus block, and the Sever (Soyuz) spacecraft docked to the space station. The OS-1962 station had four solar arrays for power. While OS-1962 was not built some of its designs were used in later space stations.  The OP space station (1962), OS-1 space station (1965), Soyuz R space station (1966) and MKBS space station (1974) also were not built. Salyut 1 became the Soviet Union's first space station in 1971.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of space stations\nSoviet crewed lunar programs\nComparison of crewed space vehicles\nSoyuz 7K-LOK\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nThe R7 based Crewed Lunar Mission \"Sever\" youtube.com\nRSC Energia: Concept Of Russian Manned Space Navigation Development\nMir Hardware Heritage\nDavid S.F.

        "content": "Lay Hoon or Lay Hoon Chan (born 1964) is a Singaporean sports executive and financial adviser. She has twice been appointed the President of the Spanish football club Valencia CF.\n\n\n== Life ==\nChan was born in August 1964. She has a degree from the University of Singapore. She qualified as an accountant and she first worked in the UK as an auditor. She then worked in multinationals before she worked for Singaporean billionaire Peter Lim.\nSim bought Valencia CF and she became the President of the club in December 2014.  In her first year, the club came fourth in their league but after that they were twelfth. The manager Nuno Espirito Santo went in 2015 and he was replaced by Gary Neville for four months before he was sacked, with Chan citing a \"language barrier\". Pako Ayestaran lasted six months then\nCesare Prandelli was manager for three months until Salvador \"Voro\" Gonzalez took over. Chan left the club in June 2017.\nValencia CF announced that she would be replaced by Anil Murthy. In June 2022 Anil Murthy left after reportedly insulting the club's owner. Peter Lim's sons became club directors and Lay Hoon Chan returned as the club President.\nIn February 2023 there were protests at a match where fans boycotted the first 20 minutes of the game to protest about Peter Lim's and Chan's leadership. The team was then 19th in the league. In the same month, her mother died and this was commemorated by her staff and reported by the press. The fans claimed that some players had not been paid but Chan was said to be living in a luxury house in Valencia.\n\n\n== References ==",

The central feature of Plaza Río de Janeiro is a fountain with a replica of Michelangelo’s David. \n\nThis plaza is surrounded by  old mansions and modern residential buildings.\nThe first name of the square was Parque Roma; later it was changed to Parque Orizaba, due to the  North-South street that intersects the park. In 1922 it was renamed Plaza Río de Janeiro at the initiative of José Vasconcelos, then Secretary of Public Education, possibly because Mexico was invited to attend the celebration of the centenary of Brazil's independence that year.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Stefano de Normandis dei Conti (Rome or Perugia, circa 1190 – Naples, 8 December 1254) was an Italian cardinal. He was a nephew of Pope Innocent III.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBelonging to a family of ancient nobility, he dedicated himself to an ecclesiastical career after the death of his wife, having already had a son Filippo who joined the Franciscan Order. In 1216 Stefano was appointed cardinal deacon of Sant'Adriano al Foro by Pope Innocent III, of whom he was a nephew. In 1228 he was translated to the title of cardinal priest of Santa Maria in Trastevere and in 1231 he was appointed Archpriest of the Vatican Basilica. He also received prebends of Lyme & Halstock (Salisbury), Lincoln, and York. After Pope Innocent IV had fled Rome for Lyon during his confrontation with Emperor Frederick II, Conti became Cardinal Vicar of Rome from 1244 to 1251. In 1245 he became the Protopriest of the College of Cardinals. At the request of the pope, he reduced the number of canonics from 36 to 25 and reformed the chapter of the Lateran Basilica. Conti served as papal legate in the Kingdom of Sicily where he pronounced papal deposition of Frederick. He then served as governor of the provinces of Sabina and Campagna e Marittima of the Papal States. He built and decorated the chapel of St. Sylvester at the church of Santi Quattro Coronati. He died in Naples on 8 December 1254, the last of the cardinals of Innocent III, and was buried in the city's cathedral.\n\n\n== Conclaves ==\nDuring his cardinalate, Stefano de Normandis dei Conti participated in the following papal elections:\n\nconclave of 1216, which elected Pope Honorius III\nconclave of 1227, which elected Pope Gregory IX\nconclave of 1241, which elected Pope Celestine IV\nconclave of 1243, which elected Pope Innocent IV\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nWerner Maleczek, CONTI, Stefano, in Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, vol. 28, Istituto dell'Enciclopedia Italiana, 1983.\nSalvador Miranda, NORMANDIS DEI CONTI, Stefano de, on fiu.edu – The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church, Florida International University.",

        "content": "The Hagedorn Prize is an annual award within the field of medical research, specifically recognizing outstanding contributions to diabetes research and endocrinology. Named after Hans Christian Hagedorn, a renowned Danish scientist and co-founder of Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium (now part of Novo Nordisk), the prize celebrates achievements in the understanding and treatment of diabetes.Hagedorn's work significantly advanced the quality of insulin production and diabetes care, making this award a tribute to his legacy in the field. The Hagedorn Prize is recognised as the most prestigious award in Internal medicine in Denmark.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe Hagedorn Prize was established by the Danish Society of Internal Medicine in 1966 to recognize the contribution to medical science made by Hans Christian Hagedorn (1888–1971). The prize is awarded at the society's annual general meeting.Initially, the Hagedorn Prize received its endowment from a distinct foundation, funded by contributions from Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium, with the Board of the Danish Society for Internal Medicine serving as its governing body. However, by 2008, the foundation's resources were deemed inadequate to sustain a meaningful award. Consequently, the remaining capital was transferred to the Novo Nordisk Foundation, which subsequently assumed the responsibility of bestowing the Hagedorn Prize, while maintaining the ongoing involvement of the Society. The recipient of the prize is determined by the society's board, relying on recommendations provided by its members.\n\n\n==== About the Danish Society of Internal Medicine ====\nThe Danish Society of Internal Medicine, comprising nearly 4,500 members, serves as an overarching body for the nine internal medicine specialties within Denmark. Its objectives include the advancement of scientific research in internal medicine and the facilitation of ongoing education for specialist physicians in the discipline. Established in 1916, the Society operates with a board of directors composed of nine members, appointed by the boards of each respective internal medicine specialty.\n\n\n=== Award ===\nThe Hagedorn Prize includes a monetary component, designed to support the ongoing research of the recipient. In addition, awardees are presented with a medal and a certificate recognizing their contributions to advancing diabetes research and treatment. The prize is intended not only to honor individuals for their past achievements but also to encourage further innovation and research in diabetes care.\n\n\n== Recipients ==\nList of recipients of The Hagedorn Prize\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Maasbeeld is a sculpture by Auke de Vries located above the Maas River in the Dutch city of Rotterdam. It balances in the middle of the Willemsbrug Bridge and a pillar of the dismantled railroad bridge. Locally, the Maas sculpture is known as The Clothesline (Dutch: De waslijn).\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe artwork is 182 meters long and consists of steel cable and several abstract elements suspended above the water of the Maas River. At high tide, one sphere floats in the water. Due to the wind and possibly wave action, the artwork is often in motion. The placing of the various elements suggests a subtle equilibrium as if it is not a heavy construction but a light piece of cord that remains in balance through a careful composition.\n\n\n== History ==\nFor five years (from 1983 to 1988), the sculpture hung between the Willemsbrug and the old railway bridge. This railroad bridge was later demolished due to the construction of a new railway tunnel, so the artwork was stored from 1988 to 1994. That year, it was placed in its current place, between the Willemsbrug and the pillar which was kept as thhe remains of the old railway bridge. A large heavy block was added to the sculpture to balance and hold the art piece which couldn't be held by the railway bridge anymore.\n\n\n== References ==",

Dan arndt (talk) 01:40, 10 April 2024 (UTC)\n\nThe Austrian Interregnum refers to the period between 1246 and 1256 (or 1278 or 1282). This is the period in which the Babenbergs died out in the Duchy of Austria and the Habsburgs came to power.\nAfter the childless Frederick II, Duke of Austria, fell in the Battle of the Leitha River on 15 June 1246, the Babenberg male line died out with him.\nSince the Privilegium Minus also provided for female succession, his sister Margaret and his niece Gertrude were now entitled to inherit. When the duchies were awarded to Margaret, she married Ottokar Přemysl, King of Bohemia, who was more than twenty years her junior, whereupon Austria became a field of conflict between the House of Přemysl and the House of Árpád, in which Ottokar was able to prevail and in 1256 he became Duke of Austria, Styria and Carinthia.\nHowever, the Wittelsbachs and the Habsburgs under Rudolph of Habsburg also claimed the Duchy of Austria. After Rudolph's victory over Ottokar Přemysl in the Battle on the Marchfeld on 26 August 1278, Rudolph's successor, his son Albert I of Habsburg, was confirmed as Duke of Austria on 17 December 1282 at the Imperial Diet in Augsburg.\n\n\n== Other “Austrian Interregna” ==\nThe Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus conquered large parts of the Habsburg lands in the Austrian–Hungarian War (1477–1488), which he ruled from Vienna between 1485 and 1490.\nAfter the death of Emperor Charles VI in 1740, Charles Albert of Bavaria of the House of Wittelsbach was Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire until 1745, when Francis, the husband of Maria Theresa, was crowned emperor.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nStephan Vajda: Felix Austria.

        "content": "Rabbi Isaac Jabez (also known as Yitzchak Yaavetz and Hachasid Yaavetz -- Hebrew: רבי יצחק יעבץ) (died 7th Tevet 5308 / 29 November 1547) was a physician and rabbi in Thessaloniki.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nRabbi Isaac Jabez was the son of Rabbi Joseph ben Hayyim Jabez, who had been exiled with the expulsion from Spain and was renowned for being an opponent of philosophy. He was the son-in-law of the Kabbalist Rabbi Yehosef ibn Shraga of Padua, from whom he also learned Torah.\nHe was a doctor in Padua, and also studied there with Judah Minz. He stated that he saw him recite the blessing of the sun in the year 5265 (1492), when he was about 100 years old.\nRabbi Yitzchak served as a rabbi in Thessaloniki, and was considered one of the Gedolei Hador (greatest of his generation), as we see from his response to a question about reciting \"The Lord, your God, is true\" which appears in the book \"Be'er Maim Chaim\" of Rabbi Chaim Ovadia di Bushal, who signed it together with other rabbis of the time, including Jacob ibn Habib, Maharash Charlivo, Moses Arama and others.\nHis grandson, also called Rabbi Isaac Jabez, wrote about him in his book \"Hasdei Avot.\" He is mentioned by Rabbi Abraham Khalfon in \"Ma'aseh Tzadikim\": \"Once Rabbi Isaac Jabez the elder was judging a certain matter. The head of the community approached and intimated to him a certain thing. His intention was to flatter him. Immediately when he saw that he had alluded to this matter, he became very angry. Nevertheless, he ruled according to the truth. He said to the people of his congregation, 'Know, gentlemen, that this was the incident. And from now on choose new judges for yourselves and teachers of Torah.' He swore an oath that he did not want this. Blessed is he and blessed is the one who gave birth to him.\"\nIn \"Machzor Hagadol for All the Year\". It is written: \"Also the artisan brothers... Solomon... and the dear Rabbi Joseph Jabez... At the beginning of the work, their old father was still alive... Rabbi Isaac Jabez ... was the father of every master who polishes an iron and lead pen and he stands over them in his great wisdom and understanding, his art and his faith, he was also the corrector and proofreader of all of this work.\"\nBesides writing the introduction to his father's book \"Hasdei Hashem,\" he authored an article called \"Reading the Shema Precisely, its Words and its Letters (\"Keriat Shema Bedikduk Imrote'ah Ve'otiote'ah.\" The piece was partially printed under his father's name.\n\n\n== Descendants ==\nHis children were Rabbi Solomon and Rabbi Joseph, who were printers and together established a printing house in 5303 (1543) in Thessaloniki and later printed the Talmud in a press they established in Constantinople.\nRabbi Solomon's son, Rabbi Isaac Jabez, authored the books: \"Chasdei Avot\" (Constantinople 5343) which is a commentary on Pirkei Avot; \"Yafek Ratzon (Constantinople 5353), which is a commentary on the Haftara according to both the Sephardi and Ashkenazi tradition; \"Torat Chesed\" (Belvedere, 5354) which is a commentary on the Five Megillot, Psalms, Book of Ruth and Book of Job.\nHe passed away on 7th of Tevet, 5308 and is buried in the old Jewish cemetery in Thessalonika.\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Kingsgate Mall is a shopping mall in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood of Vancouver, British Columbia. Construction on the mall began in 1972 with the grand opening being held on March 28, 1974. The land the mall stands on is owned by the Vancouver School Board.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe land that the mall now stands on was the location of Mount Pleasant School, originally built in 1888. In 1971, the Vancouver School Board decided to lease the land for development in order to provide funds for the board. The contract, worth $2.5 million was awarded to Royal Oak Holdings  (currently Beedie Development LTD). In 1972, Mount Pleasant School (now Mount Pleasant Elementary School) was relocated to Guleph Street and the original site closed.\nLater in the same year demolishing of the structures commenced. Construction of the mall was completed in 1974 and the opening took place on March 28, 1974, with a three-day celebration. Some initial tenants included Safeway, Fields, Radio Shack, Shoppers Drug Mart, and the Mount Pleasant Branch of the Vancouver Public Library.\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s the mall was dubbed \"Hellsgate Mall\" due to frequent crime in the mall and in the surrounding neighborhood.\nThe mall's reputation began to turn by the 2010s under the leadership of mall manger Leyda Molnar, who implemented better security and began to host community events. Molnar began working for the mall in 1999 before becoming the property manager in 2006.\nIn 2024, the mall celebrated its 50th anniversary.\n\n\n== Community Events ==\nIn 2022, Music Waste festival held several concerts at the mall.\nThe mall is host to seasonal, such as dancers for Chinese New Year and St. Patrick's Day, Santa around Christmas and pumpkin carving around Halloween. The mall has also hosted children's reading days and senior's days, which are open to the community.\n\n\n== Conflict & Controversy ==\nIn 2023 it was alleged by the Vancouver School Board  that Kingsgate Property Ltd, a subsidiary of the original developer Beedie Development Group owed $50 million in unpaid rent. In response to this the board threatened to terminate the lease in a possible bid to redevelop the land.\n\n\n== Popular Culture ==\nIn 2022, Canadian musicians Arkells and Tegan and Sara released a music video for the song Teenage Tears that features the mall.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "The Steilacoom Tribe, also Steilacoom Tribe of Indians, is an unrecognized tribe based in Steilacoom, Washington which claims descent from the historic Steilacoom people. They are neither a federally recognized tribe, nor a state-recognized tribe.\n\n\n== History ==\nBeginning in 1929, members embarked on an unsuccessful process of official recognition by the United States government, when they filed a petition in the Court of Claims, which they eventually dropped. In 1937, the Bureau of Indian Affairs suggested their members merge with the Nisqually Indian Tribe. However, the Nisqually protested the deal, fearing the loss of their self-determination, as, at the time, the Nisqually were smaller in number.\nIn 1951, the tribe was run by chairman Lewis Layton, an enrolled member of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation. In 1956, the tribe once again filed a claim under the Indian Claims Commission for the lands ceded during the treaty and won $9,246.32, however, they never accepted the money. They also filed for intervenor status during United States v. Washington (a landmark fishing rights case) but were denied.\n\n\n== Leadership ==\nThe organization is run by a nine-member council, led by a chairperson. From 1975 until her death in 2006, Joan Ortez served as chairperson following the resignation of Lewis Layton. \n\n\n== Membership ==\nAccording to their own claims, 90 percent of the membership descends from Steilacoom people during treaty times. However, a 2008 investigation by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) found that \"only three of them are documented descendants of persons described in 19th and early 20th century documents as Steilacoom Indians\" with the remainder having Native ancestry from other sources. \nAs of 1986, the group claimed about 615 members. As of 2003 there were 665 members, and as of 2008 there were 800 members.\n\n\n== Steilacoom Tribal Museum Association ==\nThe group formed the Steilacoom Tribal Museum Association, 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization in 2019. They operate a museum, which contains a snack bar and café, and business office, both in Steilacoom.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSteilacoom people\nNisqually Indian Tribe\nPuyallup Tribe of Indians\nDuwamish Tribe\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nArtman, Carl J.

        "content": "Sir Victor George Corkran KCVO (26 June 1873 – 10 March 1934) was a British courtier who served in the household of Princess Beatrice for 25 years.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nCorkran was born on 26 June 1873. He was the second son of Col. Charles Seymour Corkran, a commander of a battalion of the Grenadier Guards, and Florence Caroline Peel of Pirbright, Chipstead. Among his siblings were Maj.-Gen. Sir Charles Corkran and Violet Maud Corkran (wife of Sir Walter Farquhar, 5th Baronet) among others.\nHis paternal grandparents were Charles Corkran and Georgina Isabella (née Seymour) Corkran (a daughter of Admiral Sir George Seymour, himself a grandson of the 1st Marquess of Hertford). His maternal grandparents were Sir Charles Lennox Peel and Hon. Caroline Georgiana Chichester (a daughter of the 1st Baron Templemore).\nHe was educated at Farnborough and Eton College.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nFrom 1893 to 1894, he served as Assistant Private Secretary to Sir William Harcourt, Chancellor of the Exchequer. From 1895 to 1899, he served as Assistant Private Secretary to George Cadogan, 5th Earl Cadogan before serving for about a year as Private Secretary to William Lygon, 7th Earl Beauchamp (who also attended Eton), when he was the Governor of New South Wales. \nFrom 1900 to 1903, Corkran was Private Secretary to Lord Cadogan while he was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. After Arthur Balfour came to power, Lord Cadogan was replaced by William Ward, 2nd Earl of Dudley, and Corkran continued in his role as well as Comptroller of the Household until 1906, where \"he proved his business and social capacity in a way that ensured him a great popularity.\"\n\n\n=== Royal service ===\nIn 1907, Corkran served as Gentleman-in-waiting to Princess Beatrice (the fifth daughter and youngest child of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert) while in Spain where Beatrice's daughter, Princess Victoria Eugenie, had become Queen in 1906 upon her marriage to King Alfonso XIII. Princess Beatrice was the widow of Prince Henry of Battenberg, who contracted malaria and died aboard HMS Blonde off the coast of Sierra Leone in 1896. Corkran was appointed her permanent Equerry in 1908, succeeding Col. F. L. Colborne (who became Extra Equerry), accompanying her to official events. In London, Princess Beatrice lived at Kensington Palace, and on the Isle of Wight, she inherited Osborne Cottage near Kent House (the home of her sister, Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll), both on the grounds of Osborne House.  In 1909, he became her Comptroller and Treasurer of the Household, succeeding Lord William Cecil. Corkran served in those roles until his retirement in 1932. In this role, he represented her at official functions when she was unable to attend, including at the funeral of Princess Victor of Hohenlohe-Langenburg in 1912.\nHe was appointed Commander of the Royal Victorian Order, before being raised to Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOn 2 December 1913, Corkran was married to Hon. Hilda Caroline Chichester (1875–1961) at St Margaret's, Westminster by Corkran's cousin, the Rev. Lord Victor Seymour (youngest son of the 5th Marquess of Hertford). The ceremony was attended by Princess Beatrice, Prince Alexander of Battenberg, Princess Marie Louise of Schleswig-Holstein, and Prince Alexander of Teck. Hilda, who was a lady-in-waiting to Princess Beatrice, was the youngest daughter of Harry Chichester, 2nd Baron Templemore and Lady Victoria Ashley-Cooper (eldest daughter the philanthropist Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury). Together, they were the parents of a daughter: Beatrice Mary Lettice Corkran (c. 1917–2004),\nSir Victor died in London on 10 March 1934 at age 60. His widow, Lady Corkran, died in Bath in 1961.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n1912: Sir Victor George Seymour Corkran at the races (Photo by Getty Images)",

The fight did not \"break out\"; it is a war; we cannot just create an article every time one side retreats before attacking again. Make the article complete by telling the complete story of the battle up to when it ends (hopefully).Same goes to the other article, Draft:Gezira Campaign\nOn 8 April 2024, a battle broke out in Wad Madani, the capital of Sudan's Gezira State. This came after the first Battle of Wad Madani in December 2023.\n\n\n== References ==",

Heavily influenced by Caravaggio, he produced another version, also in 1637, now in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels.\nSigned and dated at the bottom right, Ribera's painting shows his full mature style, combining the crude and immediate Caravaggist realism with 17th century Neapolitan tenebrism with its accentuation of dramatic and violent figures. With his bad teeth visible, Marsyas turns to the viewer, making us witnesses to his pleas for mercy, whilst Apollo opens a deep wound with no facial expression beyond perhaps a subtle smile. The lyre and panpipes are hung up at the right above three fellow satyrs. The use of colour is particularly fine, reaching its apex in Apollo's robe, the sky and Marsyas' body.\n\n\n== Subject ==\nIt shows a passage in Ovid's Metamorphoses in which - after winning a musical contest against the satyr Marsyas - the god of music Apollo flays the loser. According to that work Athena had invented the panpipes but was then mocked by Eros for puffing out her cheeks and reddening her face whilst playing it and so dropped the instrument down to earth, where Marsyas found it and got so good at playing it that he thought he was a better player than Apollo. He was challenged to a contest by the god and - though it initially ended in a draw - Apollo then cunningly suggested playing their instruments backwards, which made a sound on his lyre but not on Marsyas' panpipes. That defeat then resulted in the flaying, with Marsyas' tears forming the river that bears his name.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe work is first recorded in a catalogue of the Avalos collection dating between 1650 and 1700, on the occasion of it passing from the collection of Giovanni d'Avalos, probably the commissioner, to his son  Andrea di Montesarchio. It was one of several works on the subject by Ribera - in his 1630 or 1634 Il Forastiero  Giulio Cesare Capaccio mentions a work by Ribera on that subject at Gaspar Roomer's private Villa Bisignano at the gates of Naples, probably his very first treatment of it.\nIt is still uncertain whether the work now in the Capodimonte was part of the Roomer collection, as both the version in Naples and another 1637 autograph version now in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium post-date Capaccio's text. The most probable theory is that the Flemish patron owned another now lost or unattributed version of Apollog and Marsyas by Ribera, probably contemporary with his Drunken Silenus, also now in Naples.\n\n\n=== Related works ===\nAnother of Ribera's 1637 works is also drawn from Metamorphoses, namely Venus and Adonis, now in the galleria di palazzo Corsini in Rome, which strongly relates to the Naples and Brussels works, suggesting the three works were part of the same commission. Recorded in Gaspar Roomer's house, a c.1630 work by the artist on the subject is probably the prototype for both the Naples and Brussels works. A work by his pupil Antonio De Bellis on the subject is in a museum in Sarasota. The Brussels version is slightly larger than the Naples one and has an Apollo in profile and a pink robe (rather than face on and in a purple robe as in Naples), but otherwise is very similar to it.\nIt is unknown why Ribera painted several works on the same subject at the same time or whether some or all of them were for the same or related patrons. However, it is still possible to theorise that the painter completed the (probably lost) work mentioned in Roomer's collection and it immediately proved so successful that other patrons wanted a work on the same subject and that these patrons were either based in Naples (perhaps the origin of the Capodimonte work) or lived abroad but had been able to admire the Roomer collection work (a possible origin for the Brussels work). One potential candidate for a non-Naples commissioner is Ferdinand van den Eynde, a friend of Roomer's and like him an art dealer and collector active in Naples, who is known to have commissioned from Giordano a copy of his Apollo and Marsyas, which was in van den Eynde's collection on his death in 1688.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Influence on Giordano ===\n\nThe Brussels and Naples works proved a major influence on Ribera's pupil Luca Giordano's 1659-1660 treatment of the subject, though Giordano's is in darker tones and quicker and more nuanced brushstrokes as learned during Giordano's time in Venice. Both are built on diagonal compositions, both have scattered satyrs in the background, both show Marsyas screaming, both have the two musical instruments at the top end of a diagonal, both show the start of the flaying, both show Apollo in the foreground in a purple robe, both show Marsyas' legs tied to the tree.\n\n\n=== Later history ===\nApollo and Marsyas remained in the Avalos collection in Naples until 1862, when Alfonso V d'Avalos gave it to the newly-unified Italian state. It was then valued at 800 ducats, at that date the highest value of any single work in the collection (though each of the tapestries in the Battle of Pavia was valued at 5,500 ducats). From 1957 to the early 1990s it and Giordano's version were exhibited at the Certosa di San Martino, before being moved to the Capodimonte.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography (in Italian) ==\nArchivio storico per le province napoletane, Napoli, edited by the Società napoletana di storia e patria, 2015.\nMuseo di Capodimonte, Milano, Touring Club Italiano, 2012, ISBN 978-88-365-2577-5.\nPierluigi Leone De Castris, I tesori dei d'Avalos: committenza e collezionismo di una grande famiglia napoletana, Napoli, Casa editrice Fausto Fiorentino, 1994.\nO.

The ten volumes are tales (with extensive commentary) collected by the author from 1959-1962 and  1972-1997 (volumes 1 to 7 in German, volumes 8 to 10 in English), mostly  in Namibia.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in Berlin, Sigrid Matthäi studied English and German literature at the Free University Berlin with a special interest in folklore, and gained her Ph.D. 1958 for her thesis Rittertum und Adel in den englischen und schottischen Volksballaden. Following the defense of her thesis Schmidt married an hydraulic engineer and lived in South West Africa, now Namibia, from 1959 to 1962, mostly at the construction site of the Hardap Dam. She started collecting Namibian folklore in 1960 among the Nama and Damara people. After her return to Germany Schmidt to Namibia for folkloric fieldwork in 1975, 1981, 1987, 1991, 1993, 1995, and 1997.\n\n\n== Books ==\nCatalog of the Khoisan Folktales of Southern Africa (2 vols.)

After they emigrated to Namibia in the 19th century, they brought these tales with them. The title refers to \"The Forgotten Bride\" folktale motif\n(with Helize Van Vuuren) Die vere van die duiwel: vergete ou Afrikaanse sprokies - opgediep in Namibië (The feathers of the devil: forgotten old African fairy tales - unearthed in Namibia), 2014, translated by Philip John\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nSchmidt, Sigrid (2021). \"Internationale Märchen in Namibia.

        "content": "Leanard Iosifawicz Zajac (Belarusian: Леана́рд Іо́сіфавіч За́яц, or Lawon Jazepawicz Zajac, Belarusian: Ляво́н Язэ́павіч За́яц, Russian: Леона́рд Ио́сифович За́яц; born in March 1890 in Dawhinava, died on 23 September 1935 in Ufa) was a Belarusian political activist, journalist, and author of memoirs. He was a delegate to the First All-Belarusian Congress and from 1918 held various positions in the Belarusian Democratic Republic, including government secretary, state controller, and head of the diplomatic mission in Berlin. He was imprisoned by the Soviet authorities and died in captivity.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHe was born in the village of Dawhinava, in the Vileysky Uyezd of the Vilna Governorate of the Russian Empire, now in the Vilyeyka District of the Minsk Region of Belarus. He graduated from the Leningrad State University, obtaining a law degree. From 1914 to 1916, he worked at the Vilyeyka Excise Office, and from 1916 to 1917, he served as the first (responsible) secretary of the Minsk Branch of the All-Russian Union of Landowners.\n\n\n=== Beginnings of activity in the Belarusian movement ===\nSince at least 1916, he had been in contact with the Belarusian national movement, attending meetings of its activists at the \"Belarusian Hut\" on Zacharzewskaya Street in Minsk. From March 1917, he was a member of the Belarusian People's Socialist Party, a group with a constitutional-democratic program. From April 7 to April 9, 1917, he participated as a representative of the Belarusian People's Socialist Party in the congress of Belarusian national organizations in Minsk, which advocated for the autonomy of Belarus within a democratic federation of Russia. During this congress, he was elected as a member of the presidium of the Belarusian National Committee. He belonged to the leadership of this organization, which determined its direction of activity. During another congress of Belarusian organizations and national parties on July 21–23, 1917, in protest against the actions of delegates from the Belarusian Socialist Assembly, he and delegates from the Belarusian People's Socialist Party left the meeting. On 23 July 1917, the Belarusian National Committee was dissolved.\nIn July 1917, Leanard Zajac participated in municipal elections and won a seat as a deputy in the Minsk City Pride on the Belarusian People's Socialist Party list.\n\n\n=== The First All-Belarusian Congress and the Belarusian Democratic Republic ===\nLeanard Zajac participated in the First All-Belarusian Congress, held from December 18 to December 30, 1917, in Minsk. During the congress, on 26 December 1917, he was elected as a member of the Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic. On 21 February 1918, he assumed the position of secretary in the Secretariat of Belarus, established by the Rada, which served as the embryo of the future Belarusian Democratic Republic government. He continued to work in this capacity after the declaration of independence of the Belarusian Democratic Republic on 25 March 1918, in the People's Secretariat of Belarus under the leadership of Jazep Varonka. In late April and May 1918, due to a split in the Belarusian Socialist Assembly, he supported the Belarusian Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries, but by May 14, he belonged to the so-called Block faction, which included the Belarusian Socialist Assembly, Belarusian Party of Socialist-Federalists, Belarusian Social Democratic Party, and Belarusian People's Party of Socialists. On 9 June 1918, he did not find a place in the new government under the leadership of Raman Skirmunt, but he continued to work as a secretary in Jazep Varonka's office, who did not recognize Skirmunt's government and operated in parallel. On 12 July 1918, he became a member of the Belarusian Temporary Government, established by Jazep Varonka in opposition to Skirmunt's People's Secretariat of Belarus. On 22 July 1918, he joined the committee for international affairs of the new People's Secretariat of Belarus under the leadership of Jan Sierada. In mid-November 1918, he was appointed by the next head of government, Anton Luckievich, as the state controller.\nAfter Minsk and then Vilnius were occupied by the Bolsheviks, Leanard Zajac moved between 1918 and 1919 to Grodno, which was still occupied by the Germans. There, alongside Prime Minister Anton Luckievich, he continued his activities within the structures of the Belarusian Democratic Republic. In the first days of January 1919, he was appointed by Luckievich to the Temporary City Committee established by the Germans, where he represented Belarusians. On 9 February 1919, he participated in a meeting organized by Luckievich with Belarusian organizations, during which a decision was made to initiate negotiations with the Polish government regarding the establishment of a Polish-Belarusian federation. However, the condition was the recognition by the Polish side of the Belarusian Democratic Republic Council of Ministers as the official government of Belarus, which did not happen. On 19 March 1919, in Grodno, he attended another Belarusian meeting, this time representing the Belarusian Social Democratic Party. On 22 March 1919, along with a group of Belarusian Democratic Republic politicians, he left Grodno and went to Berlin, where on May 4, he established the Belarusian Democratic Republic Diplomatic Mission in Germany. Initially, he acted as the acting head, and from August 25, he became the head of the Mission. On 27 October 1919, the Mission was downsized by Luckievich, and Leanard Zajac was ordered to return to Minsk with government funds. However, he did not comply with the orders. According to another source, he was dismissed from the position of mission head due to health reasons.\n\n\n=== Activities after the split of the Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic ===\nAfter the split of the Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic on December 13–14, 1919, Leanard Zajac became the head of the office and state secretary in the People's Council of the Belarusian Democratic Republic. In October 1920, he temporarily headed the Belarusian Press Bureau in Berlin. In 1925, he lived in political exile in Czechoslovakia, where he underwent treatment in a sanatorium and wrote memoirs. In 1925, he participated in the Second All-Belarusian Conference in Berlin, during which he recognized the Soviet authorities in Minsk as the only center for the national and state revival of Belarus. In the same year, he returned to the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. He served as a consultant-inspector at the Budget Office of the People's Commissariat of Finance of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. On 19 July 1930, he was arrested by the Joint State Political Directorate of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic and accused of involvement in the fictional anti-Soviet \"Case of the Union of Liberation of Belarus\". On 10 April 1931, he was found guilty of membership in a counter-revolutionary organization and anti-Soviet agitation. He was sentenced to 5 years of exile in Ufa, in Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. On 25 July 1935, he was arrested again by the NKVD. He died in prison during the investigation on 23 September 1935.\nOn 10 June 1988, he was rehabilitated.\n\n\n== Works and filing of documents ==\nLeanard Zajac is the author of journalistic articles and memoirs about Belarusian cultural figures. He was also one of the main custodians of documents from the Belarusian Democratic Republic at a time when most of its structures had ceased to function.\n\n\n=== Works ===\n\"Maksim Bahdanowicz\", Szlach paeta: Zbornik uspaminau i bijahraficznych materyjałau pra Maksima Bahdanowicza (in Belarusian), Minsk, 1975{{citation}}:  CS1 maint: location missing publisher (link)\n\n\n== Private life ==\nLeanard Zajac suffered from tuberculosis for many years, at least since 1916. He had been an acquaintance of the Belarusian poet Maksim Bahdanovič since the fall of 1916.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nMichaluk, Dorota (2010).

        "content": "Linqto is a San Francisco-based investment platform that allows accredited investors to invest in private-market startups and pre-IPO companies. It has users in 110 countries. As of 2024, the company is set to go public on the NASDAQ.\n\n\n== History ==\nLinqto was founded in 2010 husband-and-wife team, Bill Sarris, formerly a financial services architect at Intuit and Vicki Sarris, a former biologist.\nIn 2016 Linqto partnered with fintech firm, Leverage, and nine credit unions to launch a pilot program for the Leverage app store. The store is powered by Linqto's Otter platform, through which financial institutions select and brand fintech apps for app stores Apple, Android, and Amazon.\nIn 2018 Linqto partnered with Keiretsu Forum to build the Keiretsu Connect app that connects accredited investors from 53 chapters across 26 countries on 4 continents and allows them to view curated deals from all over the world. In September, Linqto launched the WIB Apps Store, a platform for banks to provide mobile financial technology apps to their customers. Linqto's automated delivery platform allows banks to select and brand fintech apps, makes them available for internal testing, and distributes them to app stores Apple, Google, and Amazon. In December 2018, Linqto paid $33M to acquire PrimaryMarkets, a private equity trading platform.\nIn March 2019 Greg Kidd of Hard Yaka Inc invested $1M into Linqto to fund the exploration of strategic partnership opportunities with Hard Yaka entities including Globalid.\nIn April 2020, Linqto hosted the inaugural Global Investor Conference in collaboration with Keiretsu Connect, bringing together expert advice to discuss digital opportunities during COVID-19. In 2020, Linqto launched the Linqto Trading Platform for accredited investors.\nIn March 2022, Linqto surpassed $100M in member investments including one magnitude in growth in member investment from 2020 to 2021. In August 2022, Linqto acquired Trustline to build a decentralized exchange for private market securities.\nIn November 2022 FINRA granted Linqto is its broker-dealer license with the right to operate an Alternative Trading System (ATS) for secondary trading of equity securities. In March 2023, Linqto surpassed $200M in total member investments including $50M in Ripple. In July 2023, Linqto launched its Alternative Trading System (ATS) feature to provide liquidity in private market investing. The company announced plans for public listing through a SPAC in April 2024.\n\n\n=== Products ===\nLinqto's self-directed investment platform has no fees and investment minimums are $2,500 for first time investors, and $5,000 for subsequent investments. Investors fund their brokerage cash accounts with Linqto using ACH, Wire Transfer, IRA, and an Uphold Wallet. Uphold is a separate company from Linqto. Uphold's digital wallet can hold US dollars, cryptocurrencies, commodities, foreign currencies, and other assets.\nLinqto deploys special purpose vehicles (SPVs) on its investment platform for investors to buy and sell equity in private technology companies. Linqto uses SPVs because it is a separate company that is bankruptcy remote, allowing members to invest without needing to get on the cap table of each private company they invest in.\nThe Linqto platform offers an Alternative Trading System (ATS) for secondary trading of equity securities for T-Zero, same-day settlement trading for investments in mid-to-late-stage tech unicorns and other leading private companies. Linqto Learn is a series of educational events with trends and guidance for investors.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAlternative Trading System\nSpecial Purpose Vehicle\nKeiretsu Forum\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Karl Felix (von) Seyffer (25 January 1762 in Bitzfeld (now Bretzfeld), Duchy of Württemberg – 17 September 1822 in Bogenhausen (now Munich), Kingdom of Bavaria) was a German astronomer.\n\n\n== Life and work ==\nKarl Felix Seyffer was born in the small village of Bitzfeld in Württemberg on 25 January 1762. He finished his studies at the University of Tübingen with a doctor degree, and became extraordinary professor at the University of Göttingen in the Electorate of Hanover in 1789. There he was the astronomical instructor of Carl Friedrich Gauss. He visited the First European congress of astronomers at the Seeberg observatory in Gotha in 1798.In 1804, he left Göttingen to become professor at the Bavarian University of Landshut. In 1805 and 1806, he worked for a short time in the French headquarter with the title \"Ingénieur-Géographe\". Then he was appointed as member of the statistic-topographic bureau in Munich, since 1808 as co-director.The area of the Electorate of Bavaria was considerably enlarged in 1803, and the necessity of precise maps was obvious. A survey was to be carried out, and astronomical data were needed, but at that time Munich had no competitive observatory. As a third duty, Seyffer was charged with the planning of a new observatory. He bought some new instruments, and brought them together with already available ones in a provisorical wooden building in the village of Haidhausen near Munich, where a proper installation was not possible. As a consequence of Bavaria's involvement in the Napoleonic Wars, the planning was delayed, and finally stopped completely. The new observatory was eventually constructed not until 1816 in the nearby village of Bogenhausen. Seyffer determined the geographical coordinates of the observatory, and by barometrical measures its height.\nSeyffer was seen as a difficult character by his contemporaries, and since 1813 his opponents denounced him as a friend of the French. Under the pretext of \"astronomical inactivity\" he was replaced as head of the observatory by Johann Georg von Soldner. Seyffer himself became director of the Bavarian topographic bureau since 1815. In this position he became one of the founders of the Bavarian cadastre, the first one of the German states.Seyffer's main scientific interests were on the fields of survey, geography, and meteorology.Seyffer died in Bogenhausen on 17 September 1822.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nHe was elected as ordinary member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences in 1804. The Hanoverian government awarded him the honorary title \"Hofrath\" in 1808. He became Knight of the Legion of Honour in 1809.\n\n\n== Selected writings ==\n1794: Bestimmung der Längen von Göttingen, Gotha, Danzig, Berlin, und Harefield (Middlesex) aus der Sonnenfinsterniss vom 5ten September 1793 (in German).

        "content": "Naitō Masataka (内藤政挙, May 10, 1852 - May 23, 1927), the final lord of the Nobeoka Domain in Hyuga Province, held the position as the 13th leader of the Naitō clan within the domain. As the eighth lord, he carried the responsibility of governing and overseeing the affairs of the Nobeoka Domain, ensuring its prosperity and well-being. Naito Masataka's leadership and dedication to his clan and domain left a lasting impact on the history and legacy of the Nobeoka Domain.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nOn May 10, 1852, in Edo, the sixth son of Ota Motohajime, the lord of Kakegawa Domain in Totomi Province, was born. In 1860, he became the adopted son of Naitō Masayoshi, the seventh lord of Nobeoka Domain, and succeeded to the clan headship on October 24, 1862, when Masayoshi retired. Amidst the turmoil of the late Edo period, Masataka, being a hereditary vassal of the Tokugawa family in both his birth family, the Ota clan, and his adoptive clan, the Naitō clan, acted as a pro-shogunate faction. He participated as a member of the shogunate forces in the First Chōshū expedition in 1864 and the Second Chōshū expedition in 1866. During the Battle of Toba-Fushimi in January 1868, Masataka was in his home domain, but since the domain's troops stationed in Osaka were under orders from the former shogunate, they were considered enemies by the new government. In his place, Kobayashi Yuzo, a senior retainer who was stationed in Kyoto, immediately made a defense and requested mediation from Satsuma and Kumamoto domains. Masataka also submitted a pledge of allegiance to the new government to the Satsuma Domain on February 7. Afterwards, he was ordered to go to Kyoto to make a defense and on April 5, he entered the capital and was questioned by the new government. On May 10, he received a punishment of more than 100 days of house arrest due to the misconduct of his subordinates (the domain's troops stationed in Osaka), but the two unit commanders who were held responsible were released, effectively granting him amnesty. During the Boshin War, he was only assigned to rear guard duties such as guarding Kofu Castle. In June 1869, he assumed the role of governor of the Nobeoka domain following the restoration of land ownership. However, his tenure was short-lived as in July 1871, he was relieved of his duties when the domain was dissolved and prefectures were established. Subsequently, he relocated to Tokyo with the intention of pursuing studies at Keio University, but had to abandon his academic pursuits due to an eye ailment. In 1890, the Naitō clan returned to Nobeoka to revive their former territory, which had declined due to the Satsuma Rebellion in 1877 and the Nobeoka Great Fire in 1884, and to promote education. They appointed Kanichiro Kobayashi as the family steward and reformed the family administration. In the same year, they began managing the Nihira Copper Mine. In the 1930s, by introducing Western refining methods through the recruitment of Washitaro Kasahara and establishing a hydroelectric power plant, the Naito clan's assets greatly increased. They became large landowners by purchasing mountains, forests, and tenant farms. Even when the copper mine had to be closed due to resource depletion in the Taishō era, they remained one of the wealthiest families in modern Miyazaki Prefecture. Some of their assets were allocated to charitable activities and educational initiatives. They established the Ryo Ten Sha, which traces its lineage back to the clan school, and developed it into a junior high school, which later became Nobeoka Prefectural Junior High School. In addition, they established a girls' school and developed it into Nobeoka Higher Girls' School, which was a pioneering example of secondary education for girls in rural areas, excluding the prefectural capital. Even after the transfer of Nobeoka Junior High School to the prefectural administration, the Naitō clan continued to manage the girls' school until the Shōwa era. In March 1896, they established the Nihira Elementary School within the copper mine to provide education for the children of employees. Furthermore, in September 1912, they established the Mitate Elementary School. In January 1910, the Nobeoka Electric Company was established. Along with the construction of the port, the electricity business became a catalyst for attracting the factory of Nippon Chisso, which eventually led to the establishment of today's Asahi Kasei Corporation, and laid the economic foundation of present-day Nobeoka City. In later years, a statue was erected in Nobeoka Castle to commemorate the great achievement of revitalizing the regional economy. On May 23, 1927, Naitō Masataka died at the age of 76.\n\n\n== Family Genealogy ==\nOta Sukeshi (father)\nNaitō Masayoshi (adopted father)\nNaitō Nobuko – Naitō Masafumi's daughter (legal wife)\nOda Suzuko – Oda Nagayoshi's second daughter (stepwife)\nHorikawa Eiko – daughter of Horikawa Chika (successive wife)\nHikaru Yoshioka\nNaitō Masatoshi (eldest son)\nNaitō Masamichi (fourth son)\nNaito Masatsune (fifth son)\nKatano Masaaki\nNaitō Tsuyako – Mrs. Kyōgoku Takayoshi (ex-wife)\nNaitō Tamako (second daughter) – Mrs. Masaburo Muromachi\nNaitō Fusako – Mrs. Kuriyama Shigeru\nNaitō Masatake\nKuriyama Shoichi\n\n\n== See also ==\nNobeoka Domain\nNaitō clan\nList of han\nAbolition of the han system\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Honourable Sir Gerald Henry Crofton Chichester KCVO (22 June 1886 – 8 October 1939) was a British diplomat and courtier of Anglo-Irish descent who served as Private Secretary to Queen Mary.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nChichester was born on 22 June 1886 into an old Anglo-Irish family. He was the eldest son of Arthur Chichester, 3rd Baron Templemore and, his second wife, Alice Elizabeth Dawkins. From his father's first marriage, he had an elder half-brother, Arthur Chichester, 4th Baron Templemore, who married Hon. Clare Wingfield (a daughter of the 7th Viscount Powerscourt).\nHis paternal grandparents were Harry Chichester, 2nd Baron Templemore and, his first wife, Laura Caroline Jane Paget (a daughter of diplomat Sir Arthur Paget). His nephew, Dermot Chichester, 5th Baron Templemore, became the 7th Marquess of Donegall in 1975. His maternal grandparents were Marianne Jane (née Robarts) Dawkins and Clinton George Augustus Dawkins, Consul-General to Vienna (and brother to Henry Dawkins of Over Norton Park).\nHe was educated at Eton College before attending Trinity College, Cambridge. After leaving Cambridge, he went to Frankfurt to study German.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1916, he was appointed honorary attaché to the British Legation in Copenhagen before returning to London the following year as a temporary clerk in the Foreign Office. In 1919, he went to the British Embassy in Paris where he served as Private Secretary to The Earl of Derby in 1919 when Lord Derby was the British Ambassador to France (until 1920). Chichester then became Private Secretary to Lord Hardinge in 1920, the next Ambassador to France. When the Marquess of Crewe became Ambassador, Chichester also served as his Private Secretary.\n\nChichester \"was reputed to have the most perfect manners of any British diplomat who served in Paris as well as a French accent that many Parisians could envy. In Paris he was referred to as 'Le Beau Anglais.'\"\nIn 1926, he became Assistant Private Secretary to Queen Mary, becoming her Private Secretary in 1935 after the retirement of Sir Harry Lloyd Verney. His aunt, Lady Bertha Dawkins, had served as a Woman of the Bedchamber to Queen Mary. He served in this capacity until his death in 1939. He was also a Groom-in-Waiting to King George V from 1931 until his death in January 1936. In 1932, he met with Caroline Starr Balestier Kipling and her husband, Rudyard Kipling, who was in London to go over a speech he wrote for the King for Christmas Day.\nIn 1927, he was awarded the French Legion of Honour. He was created Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1929 and elevated to Knight Commander in 1937.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\"Always immaculately dressed,\" Chichester, who never married, owned a farmhouse in Surrey where \"he created a beautiful home, and there he gathered his friends, mostly drawn from the world of art and music, of which he had a deep and intelligent appreciation.\" In London, he resided at 15 Bryanston Square in Marylebone.\nAfter becoming ill in May 1938, Sir Gerald died at Tifters Farm, Charlwood, on 8 October 1939. His funeral was held at the Charlwood Parish Church before he was cremated. \"The funeral arrangements were carried out by Mr. Thomas Wickens, jnr., Charlwood.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSir Gerald Henry Crofton Chichester at the National Portrait Gallery, London\nChichester, Sir Gerald Henry Crofton (1886-1939) Knight, private secretary at Trinity College, Cambridge",

The highest placement obtained by them is the second runner-up; won in 2020 by Patchaploy Rueandaluang, who later competed internationally in the Miss Tourism Queen of the year International 2020/2021 pageant and was named the first runner-up.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2016, after Miss Grand Thailand began franchising the provincial competitions to individual organizers, who would name seventy-seven provincial titleholders to compete in the national pageant, the representative of Nakhon Si Thammarat province was appointed. The first contest of Miss Grand Nakhon Si Thammarat was organized the following year after the license was granted to a local organizer and talent manager, Weerasak Phetkaew (วีระศักดิ์ เพชรแก้ว), who held the contest on 27 March in the city of Nakhon Si Thammarat, in which a model from Nong Khai province, Suchanee Sireenaet, was named the winner.The pageant was skipped once; in 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand, the national organizer was unable to organize the national event, and the country representative for the international tournament was appointed instead.\nWinner gallery\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Editions ==\nThe following table details Miss Grand Nakhon Si Thammarat's annual editions since 2016.\n\nNotes\n\n\n== National competition ==\nThe following is a list of Nakhon Si Thammarat representatives who competed at the Miss Grand Thailand pageant.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Miss Grand Nakhon Si Thammarat at Wikimedia Commons\nMiss Grand Thailand official website",

He has been nicknamed Balotelli.\nAhead of the 2017–18 season he joined AmaZulu. Ahead of the 2019–20 season, Ntsundwana was told by then-manager Cavin Johnson that he was not in his plans at AmaZulu, and was obligated to go on loan. Ntsundwana went to Royal Eagles, a step down to the second tier, but he did see more playing time. However, Royal Eagles disintegrated, and Ntsundwana was back with AmaZulu until he went on his second loan in January 2021, this time to Richards Bay.\nAhead of the 2021–22 season, Ntsundwana declined to return to AmaZulu and joined Richards Bay permanently. The club won promotion from the 2021-22 National First Division, with Ntsundwana being a regular in Richards Bay's subsequent stint in the Premier Division.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Castle Buren or Buren Castle (Dutch: Kasteel Buren or Huis Buren) was a princely residence in Buren in the Dutch province of Gelderland. The castle was one of the largest castles in the Netherlands. It was the seat of the Buren branch of the Egmond family, as well as of the House of Orange. It has been demolished in the 19th century. Today, not much remains except a monument in the former bailey of the castle as well as model in the local museum.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Tuff Castle Tower (12th century) ===\nThe earliest castle of Buren was probably constructed in the twelfth century. It was built on the sand of an east–west oriented ridge. A certain Otto van Buren is mentioned around 1190, but a castle is first mentioned a century later, in 1298. Foundations from that time have not been found. However, the oldest pottery shards found there date back to the eleventh or twelfth century.\nThere probably was a tuff stone tower, about thirteen meters high, as during the demolition of the castle in 1809, 400 tons of tuff stone were sold. Tuff stone, originating from the German Eifel, was widely used for castle construction since the eleventh and twelfth centuries. The use of tuff stone as a building material decreased when brick began to be used from the 13th century onwards.\nDue to its strategically important location, the Lordship of Buren had strong rulers for centuries. The Lords of Buren, who were the first to inhabit the castle, regulated water management, were the local lawmakers, and organized the oldest buildings along the river Korne. They also founded the chapel in 1367, from which the current parish church of Saint Lambertus later emerged. Lord Alard even granted Buren city rights in 1395.\n\n\n=== Rectangular Castle with Outer Bailey (13th to 15th century) ===\nIn the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, the tuff stone tower was expanded into a rectangular castle around a courtyard, with two residential wings (on the north and west sides), large towers at the four corners of the castle, a defensive wall with a battlement, and a large rectangular gate tower. An outer bailey was also built with two towers, at the northeast and southeast corners.\nIn 1335, the castle was captured and damaged by enemy troops. Nearly a century later, in 1430, it was sieged again and heavily damaged once more.\n\n\n=== The Egmonds in Buren (16th century) ===\n\n\n==== Frederik van Egmond – A Residence with Palatial Allure ====\n\nThe Duke of Guelders, Arnold van Egmond (1410–1473), expels the Lords of Buren. He grants the castle, town, and lordship of Buren to his cousin, Frederik of Egmond (1440–1521). The Egmond family hail from the Dutch village of Egmond near Alkmaar. By the fifteenth century, they were already among the most important nobles in the Netherlands. They held high military and political positions, serving as commanders and advisors to emperors, guardians of hereditary princes, and stewards in large parts of the Netherlands. Their significance at the Burgundian-Habsburg Court was such that they were ennobled as counts in 1498.\nIn 1493, the castle suffered heavy damage again when Charles II, Duke of Guelders (1467–1538) and grandson of Arnold, besieged the castle. Frederik van Egmond had it repaired and transformed into a comfortable residential palace in the early sixteenth century. Renaissance ornaments emphasized its palatial allure. New residential wings with a gate tower and a projecting extension, the Princes' Quarter, rose between the corner towers.\nBecause the castle was no longer defensible due to the increased firepower of cannons, an earthen rampart with bastions (and gunpowder magazines) was constructed around the castle corners. A gatehouse lay in the eastern rampart. At this stage, the castle complex reached its largest size: 225 by 300 meters. The castle becomes a 'Palazzo in Fortezza', a structure where a palace or noble residence is incorporated or built within a fortress of fortified complex. Other examples of such a type castle are Breda Castle, Villa Farnese in Caprarola, Italy, Krzyżtopór castle and Łańcut Castle in Poland.\nThe work was overseen by various master builders, including Rombout II Keldermans (before 1530). Andrien Seron was the architect for the castle in Breda, where the natural stone ornaments for the Buren castle were made in the construction workshop. It is therefore possible that Seron was also the architect for the Buren castle. Alessandro Pasqualini, as a fortification engineer, oversaw the construction activities of the castle's fortifications but probably did not design them. Tomasso Vincidor has also been mentioned as an architect.\n\n\n==== Floris van Egmond – Florentine Renaissance ====\n\nWith each succeeding generation, the power and wealth of the Egmonds grew. Count Floris van Egmont (1570–1539) brought Alessandro Pasqualini from Bologna, Italy, to Buren in 1537. This versatile architect worked for the counts of Buren with a few interruptions until 1548. He is best known for his extensive renovation of Buren's twelfth-century defensive fortress. In six years, the castle was transformed into a luxurious Florentine Renaissance-style palace, with four corner towers and one hundred seventy rooms. The total area measured 'in its circumference 1360 steps,' according to a description from 1741.\nMore and larger windows were added, totalling 365, allowing sunlight to flood in. Niches were created in the thick walls from which one could view the water in the moat. It was a comfortable residence. An elegant gallery with ornamented pilasters rose in the large courtyard. Together with the outer bailey, the double moat, and three drawbridges, along with four bastions and gun emplacements, they provided grandeur and security.\n\n\n==== Maximilian van Egmond ====\nFor Floris's successor, Count Maximilian (1509–1548), Pasqualini designed new gates in the city walls, of which only the Huizer or Culemborg gate remains today. He also improved the fortifications. With its streets perpendicular to each other, all leading to the city wall, Buren still retains the form of an Italian-French bastide (fortified town) to this day.\n\n\n=== William of Orange (16th century) ===\n\nIn 1545, Count Maximilian receives a high-profile visit from Emperor Charles V, accompanied by, among others, his twelve-year-old page, William, Prince of Orange (1533–1584). Maximilian's only child is his daughter Anna van Egmond (1553–1558), also twelve years old. It is likely that the emperor and the count agree on a marriage between the two on this occasion.\nIn 1551, the Archbishop of Cologne blesses the marriage of Prince William of Orange and Countess Anna of Egmond-Buren in the chapel of Buren Castle. Both are eighteen years old. Among the hundreds of guests on the wedding day of July 8, 1551, are also the four brothers of William of Orange. The young couple alternates between living at Castle Buren and Breda Castle. Anna dies just seven years later after a brief illness. The castle is inherited by her eldest son, Philip William, Prince of Orange. Unfortunately, he is abducted on the orders of King Philip II of Spain and spends much of his life in Spanish exile.\n\n\n=== Maurice of Orange (17th century) ===\n\nDue to Philip William's forced stay in Spain, his brother Maurice of Orange (1567–1625) assumes control of the County of Buren. Maurice leads the struggle for freedom of the Netherlands against Spain and can spare little attention to Buren Castle. However, he has a new parapet built on the bastions. He also sketches plans for two Renaissance gardens on either side of the outer bailey in the year 1620.\nIn the first half of the 17th century, various gardens were constructed around the castle. Upon his return from Brussels in 1608, Philip William, Prince of Orange, had a garden built on the south side of the outer moat, known as the Prince's Garden.\nWhen Maurice owned the castle of Buren between 1618 and 1625, the construction of two gardens within the walls began. The Great Court, the northern garden within the walls, was the first to be constructed, for which 30 linden trees, 6,000 hornbeam trees, and 35,000 firethorns were imported. The linden trees were planted along the avenue before entering the court. Subsequently, the Small Court, the southern garden within the walls, was constructed. These gardens resembled the garden next to the Mauritshuis at the Buitenhof in The Hague.\n\n\n=== Frederick Henry of Orange (17th century) ===\n\nFrederick Henry of Nassau (1584–1647) became the heir to Maurice in 1625. In addition to the two courts within the walls, gardens outside the walls were also constructed. By around 1630, the castle grounds were surrounded by five gardens: the Prince's Garden, presumably created in 1608 on the south side; the 'Racecourse' with a star-shaped pattern of three intersecting avenues on the west side; and the northern garden consisting of a rectangular plot with a star-shaped path structure.\nIn 1636, Frederick Henry and his wife Amalia also decided to enhance the castle, particularly its interior. He commissioned Jacob van Campen, Johan van Swieten, and Pieter Post for this purpose. The works lasted until 1647. The gallery was painted with winged putti holding their respective coats of arms. A 'Triumphal Hall' was created on the first floor, for which several rooms were demolished to make a gallery. Large paintings depicted the spectacular conquests of the stadtholder. It was intended to impress the numerous high-ranking guests, including Queen Henrietta Maria of England (1609–1669).\n\n\n=== Decline of the Castle (1647-1804) ===\n\nAfter the death of Frederick Henry, a period of neglect and decline began. William II (son of Frederick Henry) and his wife Mary Stuart showed no interest in Buren. The castle was largely stripped of its furnishings, the gardens became overgrown, and the building fell into disrepair. William III to William V were successive owners, but their castle remained neglected. King-Stadtholder William III had the most beautiful pieces transferred to his newly built hunting lodge at Soestdijk.\nThe gardener and plantation master Cornelis van Langelaar (1676–1748), appointed in 1705, gradually rose to higher positions within the Domain Council, the management authority on behalf of the successive stadtholders. Thus, the surroundings of the castle, the houses on the outer bailey, and along the castle avenue were inhabited. Langelaar's daughter was married to an agent who lived at Buren Castle.\nThe castle was extensively drawn and painted. Most drawings date from the 1720s and 1730s. At the end of the century, the castle was no longer inhabited. In 1789, Prussian troops were quartered in the castle. Subsequently, it was used as a hospital for Hessian and English soldiers who completely ravaged it.\nWith William V, the end came. This last Stadtholder fled to England when the French invaded the country in 1795. In 1801, the County of Buren lost its independence.\n\n\n=== Demolition and Destruction of the Castle (1804-1883) ===\n\nAfter the establishment of the Batavian Republic, the castle was confiscated as property of the House of Orange. During the republic, little care was given to the building and the grounds. Moreover, no purpose could be found for the castle, leading the government to decide in 1804 to sell the castle, the bailiff's residence, and a large portion of the buildings and stables for demolition. On that occasion, the municipality of Buren became the owner.\nIn the same year, demolition of the castle began. Usable materials, such as bricks, beams, and poles, were sold to interested parties. The rubble was thrown into the inner moat around the castle, and the earthworks were pushed into the outer moat. The demolition of the castle lasted until 1883, when the last gatehouse was demolished.\n\n\n==== Building Fragments and Reuse ====\nLarge quantities of wood, stone, and tiles, monumental fireplaces and doors, stairs, ornate pilasters and gates were sold and ended up in farmhouses or served as building materials for houses in Buren. Various remaining building fragments are located in the Egmond Hall of the Buren & Orange Museum.\n\n\n=== Today ===\n\nOnly the castle grounds have largely remained intact, which still contain the foundations in the ground. These foundations were partially excavated in 2003. By digging a few well-chosen test trenches, which included both the outer bailey and the main castle, a good idea was obtained of what the castle looked like in the past and what the current condition of the foundations is.\nIn the Oranjemuseum in the town of Buren, there is a large model that very accurately depicts the castle as it appeared at its peak.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nSchipperus, P.J.

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "September Ballads is a 1987 studio album by Mark Murphy.\nSeptember Ballads is the 27th recorded album by American jazz vocalist Mark Murphy. It was recorded when Murphy was 55 years old and released by Milestone Records in the United States in 1989. The release is an all-ballad session featuring the work of then contemporary composers.\nMark Murphy recorded September Ballads in three days in September and two days in November 1987 with producer and arranger Larry Dunlap. Murphy is accompanied by guests Larry Coryell on electric guitar and Art Farmer on flugelhorn.\nThe release includes Murphy's own lyrics to Pat Metheny and Lyle Mays's “September Fifteenth” and his original composition “Sausalito”.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn the biography This is Hip: The Life of Mark Murphy by Peter Jones, Murphy is quoted as saying, “It’s a truism that ballads are a singer’s biggest challenge. In fact, it’s like you’re doing a small movie on the fly - you’re in it, you’re telling the story, creating the mood and sustaining it. You’ve got nothing to hide behind.” Murphy calls the songs on the release \"new standards\".\nMurphy explains, “Some of these songs are newish and some have been unjustly neglected. Most have been with me a long time. ‘When This Love Affair Is Over,’ for instance, I heard 20 years ago in New York. It was a track on a Peter Allen album, and it just stuck in my mind. And Gary McFarland's ‘Sack Full of Dreams’ - I’ve almost recorded it many times, and finally decided now was the time to do it.\"\nMurphy, discussing the songs says, “The Michael Franks tune ‘When She Is Mine,’ I'm amazed no one else has picked up on it, it's a fantastic song. And Steve Allen's ‘Spring Is Where You Are’ - I used to go on his old show and sing his songs, and that was always my favorite of all the stuff he'd written”.\nMurphy contributes lyrics to Pat Metheny and Lyle Mays's “September Fifteenth” and an original composition “Sausalito”, which was originally written in the 50s, rewritten and recorded in the 60s and released on Bridging a Gap in 1973, and now re-recorded in a new arrangement by Larry Dunlap.\nSpeaking to Dan Ouellette, in a feature in DownBeat in 1997 Murphy is quoted as saying, “I love doing ballads. That’s when I feel I can communicate one-to-one with listeners. People tell me that it’s as if I’m singing directly to them. I’ve been a part of marriages and divorce settlements, child conceptions and wakes, my fans keep my albums for years. They come up to me at my live shows with these scratchy LPs and ask me to sign them. I never sold a million albums, but those I did sell are still out there. Shirley [Horn], Sheila [Jordan] and I seem to be the last of our generation. But the gold is that when you reach maturity as vocalists, you begin to sing your life. You’re not just performing. You’re putting your life into your songs.\"\nIn his book, This is Hip: The Life of Mark Murphy, author Peter Jones writes that \"The liner notes pointed out that he [Murphy] was now hitting his stride as a revered elder statesman of jazz: \"Mark Murphy is an international jazz figure who tours Europe several times a year, appearing in clubs, concerts, festivals, and television programs. He was the subject of a TV special in Yugoslavia, Denmark, Sweden, and Britain, and has been seen on PBS stations in this country. Murphy has also played to enthusiastic audiences in Japan and Australia\".\nSpeaking about his favorite personal recordings with Ted Pankin years later, Murphy said, \"I loved a ballad album I did for Fantasy called September Ballads, which includes that “Goodbye” song to Bill Evans and some beautiful pieces by writers of the ‘70s, which I’m very surprised that people who sing my type of songs don’t pick up on. So there you are\".\n\n\n== Recording ==\nMark Murphy recorded September Ballads in three days in September and two days in November 1987 with producer and arranger Larry Dunlap. Murphy is accompanied by guests Larry Coryell on electric guitar and Art Farmer on flugelhorn.\nPeter Jones says, \"It's a soft, gentle album, richly melodic, played straight, with no unorthodox arrangements or challenging scat experiments\". The recordings include \"September Fifteenth\" by Pat Metheny and Lyle Mays which refers to the day in 1980 when Bill Evans died; Gary McFarland's \"haunting\" \"Sack Full of Dreams\"; Richard Rodney Bennett's \"I Never Went Away\"; \"Para Nada\" (\"For Nothing\") by Brazilian singer and pianist Eliane Elias; and \"a gentle, lilting new version\" of Murphy's own Sausalito.  An additional five tunes were recorded but weren't included in the final release. \"For me it was a very expensive album. We ran up huge mixing bills, the sessions were long... but the album was wonderful. I expected some promotion from the company [Fantasy], but they didn't give any\" complained Murphy.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nOverall the critical reception to the album has been positive.\nMurphy was nominated for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Male for September Ballads at the 31st annual Grammy Awards in 1988. Peter Jones writes, \"In February he [Murphy] had been briefly elated by the news that September Ballads had received a Grammy nomination - his fourth in the category Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Male. This time he was beaten by Bobby McFerrin with \"Brothers\", a duet with Rob Wasserman\".\nPublished reviews and discussions include the following:\nThe AllMusic entry gives the album 4 stars.\nScott Yanow includes the album in his list of \"other worthy recordings\" by Mark Murphy in his book The Jazz Singers: The Ultimate Guide.\nThe Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music rates the release as good (3/5, meaning by the artist's usual standards and therefore recommended). \nAndre Gilbert assigns the album 4.5 bones in MusicHound Jazz: The Essential Album Guide calling it \"an album only Mark Murphy could pull off\", featuring \"more range than most singers cover in a career\", turning each tune \"into an effective jazz vehicle\" and calling Dunlap's arrangements and the flugelhorn accompaniment by Art Farmer, the electric guitar by Larry Coryell and the acoustic guitar by Oscar Castro-Neve's \"gorgeous\".\nThe Penguin Guide to Jazz assigns 3 stars (meaning a good if middleweight set; one that lacks the stature or consistency of the finest records, but which is certainly rewarding on its own terms) and the review says. \"Nothing really stands out on the pleasing but muted September Ballads\".\nJohn Swenson, in The Rolling Stone Jazz & Blues Album Guide, assigns the album 4 stars (excellent) and writes, \"Murphy's Milestone recordings are magnificent vocal sets: September Ballads collects what Murphy calls 'contemporary standards' that showcase his rich baritone and shrewd harmonic sense\".\nChris Albertson, writing a 1988 review of the album in Stereo Review, calls the album \"very good\" finding Murphy to be \"at his best when he sings simply. That's what he does in September Ballads, a quiet, tasteful album with superb accompaniments by a group that includes guitarist Larry Coryell and Art Farmer on flugelhorn. There's not a smidgen of the pretentiousness that sometimes mars Murphy's work, just a set of ballads sung in a delightful, relaxing style. The program is not the usual collection of evergreens but is nicely varied and includes Murphy's own Sausalito.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"September Fifteenth\" (Pat Metheny, Lyle Mays, Mark Murphy) – 5:26\n\"When She is Mine\" (Michael Franks) – 5:46\n\"When This Love Affair is Over\" (Peter Allen, David Foster) –  5:07\n\"Night Life\" (Walt Breeland, Paul Buskirk, Willie Nelson) – 4:20\n\"Sack Full of Dreams\" (Gary McFarland, Louis Savary) – 5:33\n\"Crystal Silence\" (Chick Corea, Neville Potter) – 3:57\n\"I Never Went Away\" (Sir Richard Rodney Bennett) – 5:04\n\"Sausalito\" (Mark Murphy) – 3:46\n\"Para Nada\" (Eliane Elias) – 4:52\n\"Spring Is Where You Are\" (Steve Allen) – 5:35\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nPerformance\nMark Murphy – vocals\nJ David Belove – bass (tracks 1,6,7,9)\nJeff Carney – bass (tracks 5,8,10)\nScott Steed – bass (tracks 2,3,4)\nLarry Coryell – electric guitar\nVince Lateano – drums\nOscar Castro‐Neves – guitar (tracks 1,6,7,9)\nBob Mocarsky – synthesizer\nLarry Dunlap – piano, arranger, and on track 8 background vocal\nJohn Santos – percussion (all except 2,3,10)\nArt Farmer – flugelhorn (tracks 2,5,7)\nDonald Bailey – harmonica (tracks 2,3,4)\nProduction\nDanny Kopelson – engineer\nLarry Dunlap – producer\nLupe De Leon – co-producer\nPhil Carroll – art direction\nGeorge Horn – mastering\nPhil Bray – photography\nJamie Putnam – photography\nCleo Laine – liner notes\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSeptember Ballads  at MusicBrainz (release group)\nSeptember Ballads at Discogs (release)\nSeptember Ballads at AllMusic (release)\nSeptember Ballads at Internet Archive\nSeptember Ballads in The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music at Internet Archive\nSeptember Ballads in MusicHound Jazz at Internet Archive\nSeptember Ballads in The Penguin Guide to Jazz at Internet Archive\nSeptember Ballads in The Rolling Stone Jazz & Blues Album Guide at Internet Archive\nTed Pankin Mark Murphy interviews and liner notes.\nConcord Music official release",

        "content": "Kindia gangan is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is the sole species in genus Kindia. It is endemic to Guinea in West Africa. It is known only from the northeastern slope of Mount Gangan in Kindia Prefecture from 230 to 540 meters elevation, in the Guinean forest–savanna ecoregion.\nIt is a small perennial multi-stemmed subshrub. It produces white flowers from June to September which develop into greenish-white berries.\nIt lives on high sandstone cliff faces where it grows in narrow fissures which are shaded over part of the day. The plants typically occur in colonies of 7 to 15 plants, and rarely 1 to 3. The plant is thought to be pollinated by bats.\nThe species has an estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) of 28 km2 and an estimated area of occupancy (AOO) of 20 km2. Field work in the species' known range found only 86 individuals. The known populations grow in Gangan Classified Forest. Sandstone quarrying is common in the area, but isn't known to be an immediate threat to the species.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Gonçalo Feio (born 17 January 1990) is a Portuguese professional football manager and former player who is the current manager of Ekstraklasa club Legia Warsaw.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nHe spent his football career in youth teams of Benfica and Belenenses.\n\n\n== Managerial career ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nFeio started his coaching career during his studies at the University of Lisbon. As a first-year student, he won a competition organized by the university for the best work on youth football training. As his reward, he was offered an internship in Benfica's academy, where he worked with under-8 and under-10 youth groups. For one season, he was also an assistant coach of the under-15 team.In 2010, Feio came to Poland as part of a student exchange between the universities of Lisbon and Warsaw. Initially, in order to afford his stay in Poland, he worked as a language tutor.In November 2010, he joined Legia Warsaw's academy, working with numerous age groups in both head and assistant coaching positions. In 2014, he joined Legia's senior team staff as a data analyst and later assistant coach, under first team managers Henning Berg and Stanislav Cherchesov. He left Legia in November 2015.\nIn 2016, he moved to Wisła Kraków, where he worked as youth coach and assistant coach to first team managers Kiko Ramírez and Joan Carrillo. In 2019, he moved to Super League Greece club Xanthi, where he operated as an assistant coach of Kiko Ramírez. Feio went back to Poland in 2020, finding employment as an assistant to Marek Papszun at Raków Częstochowa. He left Raków following a physical altercation with team manager Kamil Waskowski.\n\n\n=== Motor Lublin ===\nOn 19 September 2022, Feio took on his first senior managerial role when he was appointed manager of II liga club Motor Lublin, who at the time were placed bottom of the league table. With Feio in charge, Motor won the promotion play-offs and returned to I liga after a thirteen-year hiatus.On 5 March 2023, following a league match against GKS Katowice, Feio insulted Motor's press officer Paulina Maciążek, which led to a confrontation with the club's chairman Paweł Tomczyk, during which Feio attacked him with a desk tray. Tomczyk had to be treated in a hospital, and left the club soon after, along with Maciążek. Motor's owner Zbigniew Jakubas defended Feio during a press conference two days later. For his actions, the Polish Football Association Disciplinary Committee penalised the Portuguese manager with a two-year ban (sentence suspended for a period of one year), a financial fine and ordered him to issue a written apology to both Maciążek and Tomczyk.He left the club in March 2024, despite Motor overperforming in their first season back in the second division; at the time of Feio's departure, they were placed fifth in the league table.\n\n\n=== Legia Warsaw ===\nOn 9 April 2024, following Kosta Runjaić's dismissal, it was reported by the media that Feio was to replace him as manager of Ekstraklasa side Legia Warsaw. A day later, Feio was officially announced by the club, signing a deal until the end of the 2024–25 season.\n\n\n== Managerial statistics ==\nAs of match played 13 April 2024\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Paulette Clancy is a British physicist and Professor of Materials Science at Johns Hopkins University. Her research investigates the development of machine learning strategies to advance innovation in materials design, with a focus on complex situations (e.g. solution processing). She was awarded the American Institute of Chemical Engineers Women's Initiatives Mentoring Award.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nClancy is from London.  She was an undergraduate student at Queen Elizabeth College, where she studied chemistry. She moved to the University of Oxford for her doctoral research in physical chemistry. \n\n\n== Research and career ==\nAfter her PhD, Clancy was a postdoctoral researcher at both Cornell University and the University of London. During her postdoc at Cornell she bought a Chevrolet Camaro and drove all around North America. She returned to the United Kingdom, where she worked for an oil company.\nIn 1987 Clancy joined the faculty at Cornell University. She spent over thirty years at Cornell, eight of which she spent as the Director of the Computational Science and Engineering and Bodman Chair of Chemical Engineering. Clancy founded the Women in Science community at Cornell University, and has advocated for equity and inclusion throughout her career. She joined the faculty at the Whiting School of Engineering in 2018, and was appointed the Edward J. Schaefer Professor in 2023.\nHer research investigates the use of computational materials science. She looks to understand the relationship between atomic structure and material properties. At Johns Hopkins University she leads the Data Science and AI Initiative. Her research involves computational simulations of semiconducting materials, include inorganic (e.g. silicon and germanium) and molecular systems. She is interested in the simulation of complex organic systems (e.g. antibacterial oligomers and covalent organic frameworks), understanding processes involved during nucleation and crystal growth, and the development of large-scale models for materials innovation (machine learning, force fields, Bayesian optimisation).\n\n\n=== Awards and honours ===\nAlice Cook Award\nCornell University Zellman Warhaft Award\nElected to the Board of Directors\nElected a Fellow of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE)\nElected to the advisory board of Materials Horizons\n\n\n=== Selected publications ===\nHer publications include:\n\nPentacene Thin Film Growth\nA 2D covalent organic framework with 4.7-nm pores and insight into its interlayer stacking\nComparison of semi-empirical potential functions for silicon and germanium\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On 9 April 2024, an explosion at the Bargi hydroelectric power station hydroelectric power plant owned by Enel Green Power left seven workers dead and five others critically injured. The power station is located in Bargi, one of the villages around Lake Suviana lying upstream, in Camugnano near Bologna, Italy.\n\n\n== Background ==\nLake Suviana is a reservoir that was formed following the construction of a dam in 1932. Due to increased energy demand, the Bargi hydroelectric power station was built in 1975 at a depth of 30 metres. The power plant uses water from both Lake Suviana and Lake Brasimone.\n\n\n== Explosion ==\nThe explosion occurred around 15:00 CEST at the hydroelectric power plant of Italian company Enel Green Power in Bargi, one of the five villages around Lake Suviana in the commune of Camugnano.\nThe power plant is located about 30 metres (98 ft) underground. The prefect of Bologna, Attilio Visconti, said the explosion originated from a turbine located eight levels down and resulted in a fire, and the floor below it flooded. Enel Green Power said there was no damage to the dam's structure.\n\n\n== Victims ==\nFifteen people were working at the plant at the time of the explosion. In the immediate aftermath, three workers were killed, including two from the southern cities of Taranto and Messina and a man from Romania who resided in Settimo Torinese. Five people were critically injured with severe burns; they were transported by helicopter to nearby hospitals. Two people are in intensive care. Four workers were decleared missing. Three other workers escaped unharmed.\nOn 10 April, aquatic drones were deployed in the lake to search for the missing. The next day, three of the missing were found dead, bringing the death toll to six. The men were from Padua, Milan and Pisa. On the morning of 12 April, the last missing worker, a man from Naples, was found dead, bringing the death toll to seven.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe fire brigade had great difficulty gaining access to the fire. A rescue diver gained access to the seventh floor below the surface, but not lower where three people were trapped.\nEmployees were evacuated following the explosion and electricity production was halted.\n\n\n=== Strikes and protests ===\nThe explosion contributed to concerns about work safety in Italy, with two of the country's largest unions renewing calls for planned nationwide four hour-strikes on 10 April. Following the explosion, more strikes and protests took place on 11 April.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nAuthorities said the explosion appeared to have been caused by a defect in one of the turbines. According to Marco Masinara, the mayor of Camugnano, the explosion occurred during maintenance work. An investigation is due to launched after the missing people are found and the plant is deemed safe.\nOn 10 April, Masinara said the plant was never known to be at risk of such an incident.\nMore than two years before the explosion, the Italian Labour Union issued warnings about safety risks in the hydroelectric power station. However, Enel Energy denied such reports and said that it had received appreciation from labor unions in 2022 for the company’s approach to training, safety, and risk assessment.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nItalian prime minister Giorgia Meloni said she was \"anxiously\" following the news and thanked the rescue workers. Enel Green Power also expressed its condolences to the families of the victims and has established an immediate fund of two million euros to enable the individuals involved and their families to address their immediate needs and emergencies. The company also initiated an internal fundraising campaign to provide employees with the opportunity to express their condolences and solidarity with the families of the victims.\nOn 10 April the explosion was commemorated by the Italian Chamber of Deputies.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Christian Literature Society of Japan (CLSJ; 1913-1933) was a publisher of religious literature in Tokyo, serving as the official organ of the Federated Missions in Japan. The Committee on Christian Literature of the Conference of Federated Missions was established in 1912. Its outgrowth was the CLSJ, the name change occurring in January 1913. The CLSJ rendered a service for Japan much the same as similar societies that had been organized previously in India and China. \n\n\n== Predecesor organizations ==\nIn the 19th-century, the best work in Christian literature in Japan had been effected by the regularly organized tract and literature societies. Those with headquarters abroad, in the U.S. and Great Britain were also helpful. Among these were the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, whose catalogue included Japanese editions of the Prayer Book, commentaries on books of the Bible, and volumes on the creeds and offices of the Church. There were also works, devotional, theological, historical and philosophical, translated from standard authors abroad. The American Tract Society began to promote Christian literature in Japan as early as 1874. The Religious Tract Society began work as early as 1837. It was the chief supporter of the Japan Book and Tract Society. Among the institutions which were cooperative in character and had their headquarters in Japan, the oldest was the Japan Book and Tract Society. The American Tract Society, which began work in the country in 1874. The Religious Tract Society planned its organized work in Japan in 1874 and established the Tokyo corresponding committee in the following year. On May 1, 1891, the work of the three committees was united under the Tract Societies' Committee for Japan, of which Rev. W. J. White was agent. In 1898, the designation of the committee was changed to \"The Japan Book and Tract Society\". The report of 1913 referred to a falling off in the sale of this society's own books, because increasingly, missionaries were finding it more convenient to have much of the literature they used printed locally, especially tracts. The Japanese YMCA Union issued occasional books on religious and Biblical subjects, and dealt with the question of purity and of physical development, especially with a view to helping young men.\n\n\n== Establishment ==\nAs none of these institutions were in a position to meet the demands for literature, the Conference of Federated Missions in Japan appointed a Committee on Christian Literature to consider mainly the formation of some permanent organization, in cooperation with the Japanese, to make more adequate provision for producing and distributing Christian literature. After three years of work by this committee, which included Professor Frank Müller, the Conference in 1911 resolved to appoint a Permanent Committee, (1) to report to the Japanese Church Federation on the proposed organization and to consult with it on finances and plans; (2) to invite the Japanese Church Federation to arrange for a Permanent Committee of nine of its members to co-operate with nine from the Conference of Federated Missions; (3) to ask the Japanese Church Federation to provide funds to support a Japanese man to give his whole time to this work in cooperation with a foreigner.\nThe Japanese Church Federation was not finally organized until December 1911, so that it could not enter into the full plans from the first, especially in view of the financial responsibility. Five Japanese, however, were appointed to serve on the committee in an advisory capacity. This committee held its first meeting on January 5, 1912, and decided to make a systematic digest of the religious press of Japan, and to compile and publish a comprehensive catalogue of Christian books in Japanese. On July 21, 1912, the Rev. S. H. Wainright, D.D. (Methodist Episcopal Church, South), was appointed executive secretary of the Permanent Committee, his salary being fully paid by his own mission.\nIt was proposed to form the Christian Literature Society of Japan, the object of which was to be the production and circulation of Christian literature suited to the needs of both Christian and non-Christian Japanese. Representing the Federated Christian Missions in Japan, the society was to be correspondingly catholic in spirit, and neither its members nor those supporting it were to be regarded as necessarily holding all the views presented in the books issued.\nAt the Conference of Federated Missions held in January 1913 the proposals of the Permanent Committee were adopted, and the new organization definitely named The Christian Literature Society of Japan, not \"for Japan\" as was the case of the corresponding societies organized for China and India. Arrangements were made for organizing its finances. It was resolved to approach the missions and boards represented in the conference for appropriations of money, on the basis of £1 per member (counting men and women) in their respective stations in Japan. Provision was made for individuals to join as associate members for £1 per annum or as life members for £20.\n\n\n== Kyobunkwan ==\nThe CLSJ was located in the Methodist Publishing House (MPH). The MPH was also known by its Japanese name as Kyobunkwan. The CLSJ used the MPH facility to publish and distribute its literature.  \nIn addition to housing the CLSJ, the Kyobunkwan engaged in publishing, retailing, and printing its own publications of Christian literature in English and in Japanese. It was established to ensure a plentiful supply of Christian books for Japan and Korea. In addition to religious books, the Kyobunkwan stocked imported books on various subjects. It held a large stock of English language books of every sort as well as British, American, and German periodicals. There was a wide selection of stationary and desk supplies, as well as Waterman and Swan fountain pens, Underwood typewriters and Victor phonographs and records. It also carried on a large foreign mail order business for individual customers. The company's goal was to conduct a business along Christian lines and to be a clearing house for Christian workers in Japan..\n\n\n== History ==\nIt had for its aim not undenominational, but an interdenominational venture. It sought to encourage the promulgation of the ideas embodied in the literature of the Protestant denominational bodies represented in Japan, though, as a matter of course, strict sectarianism was to be avoided.\nIts initial tasks in 1913 were: \n\nA review of the religious press.\nAn investigation and cataloguing of the existing Christian literature in the vernacular.\nThe formation of a collection of Christian books in the vernacular.\nThe distribution of English books among Japanese pastors, contributed by authors and friends abroad.\nThe organization of a department of Christian news.\nA comprehensive programme-including twelve series of books to form The Christian Library. These could be either translations or original productions.\nBy 1914, the catalogue of existing Christian literature in the vernacular had been completed. It contained a list of about 2,000 publications, upon which the following notes were made:\n\nA large number of these publications had been issued by Christian writers, and dealt with a variety of subjects.\nAlmost the entire list was composed of works brief in compass and low in price.\nOf the Christian writings listed, about equal proportions were translations of foreign works, and original writings produced in Japan.\nThe outstanding need in the field was the production of substantial writings or translations in Japanese in which Christian subjects received full and adequate treatment.\nIt appeared from the report in the Christian Movement that the society published its own works, the printing being done chiefly by the Fukuin Press, which had taken over the printing department of the Methodist Missions. The Methodist Publishing House acted as sales' agent. The sore need of facilities for distribution led to the appointment of Dr. E. N. Walne, of the Southern Baptist Convention, to organize this department. During its first year, the society issued about two million pages of new literature. It could not do more without a capital fund providing about £50 to £200 for each publication.\nThe output of the CLSJ in 1915 was treble that of the previous year, and the circulation of its publications increased five-fold.\nIt published nearly 32,000,000 pages of Christian literature in 1916. By 1917, it was probably the most closely unionized Christian organization in Japan.\nBy 1928, the CLSJ had become the successor to the Methodist Publishing House (Kyobunkwan).\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThere were already self-supporting Christian bookshops in the large cities, and many non-Christian stores had been persuaded to carry a limited stock of Christian literature.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Judith Beheading Holofernes is an early 17th century painting now in a private collection. It is thought to be an earlier version of Caravaggio's work on the same subject or an earlier version of Louis Finson's copy of that work.\n\n\n== Background ==\nWhen Caravaggio left Naples on 14 June 1607, he left two paintings - the Madonna of the Rosary and Judith beheading Holofernes - in the studio in Naples that was shared by Louis Finson and his partner, the Flemish painter Abraham Vinck. Vinck likely took the two paintings with him when he moved to Amsterdam around 1609.  Later Finson also moved to Amsterdam. The two paintings are mentioned again, this time in the will and testament dated 19 September 1617 prepared by Finson in  Amsterdam, where he died.  In his will Finson left all his interest in the two Caravaggio paintings that he and Vinck had owned in common since Naples to Vinck. Finson died not long after making his will and the paintings became the property of Vinck.\nVinck in turn died in 1619 in Amsterdam and under his will his entire estate was left to his widow. His wife died two years later and a large portion of the estate, including a number of paintings, was sold through auctions held in Amsterdam.  The Caravaggios were not among the paintings sold at the auctions. The heirs sold the Madonna of the Rosary after 1619 for 1800 florins to a committee of Flemish painters and 'amateurs' led by Peter Paul Rubens for the Saint Paul's Church of the Dominican friars in Antwerp. The painting arrived around 1623 in Antwerp and was given pride of place on the chief altar of the church.  In 1786, Emperor Joseph II of Austria, after ordering the closing of all 'useless' monastic orders in the Southern Netherlands, claimed the painting of Caravaggio for his art collection.  It can now be admired in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.  Caravaggio's work, which was a pious gift of Antwerp's leading artists and an expression of their deep religious devotion had thus become the object of looting by the Austrian rulers.\nThere has been no confirmed news about the second Caravaggio representing Judith beheading Holofernes co-owned by Vinck and Finson since its mention in the will of Finson dated 1617. It is known that the son-in-law of Vinck who was the executor of the estate tried to sell the more expensive paintings in the estate outside of the auctions. It is recorded that he sent a Caravaggio taxed at 600 guilders to a buyer in Rome but it is not noted what the subject of the work was. A painting of Judith beheading Holofernes said to have been discovered in an attic in Toulouse in 2014 is believed by some scholars and experts to be the lost Caravaggio. It resembles a painting of lower quality in the collection of the Intesa Sanpaolo bank in Naples which has traditionally been regarded as a copy after an original, lost work of Caravaggio made by Finson.  Other scholars see in the Toulouse Judith an original creation of Finson rather than a copy after a lost Caravaggio. The Toulouse Judith has even been described as Finson's masterpiece.  The work in the collection of the Intesa Sanpaolo bank is regarded by them as a copy by Finson or possibly his friend and pupil Faber after Finson's original creation. The Toulouse Judith was slated to be auctioned in June 2019 but was snapped up by hedge fund manager J. Tomilson Hill through a private sale at an undisclosed amount shortly before the auction was planned to go ahead.\n\n\n== References ==",

Under Hahn's leadership, KCU addresses the health care needs of underserved populations in both urban and rural communities, and now includes two sites for its college of osteopathic medicine, a growing college of biosciences, which includes a doctoral program in clinical psychology, and a new college of dental medicine.\n\n\n=== Achievements and recognitions ===\nIn 2022, Hahn was honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health Policy Fellowship program at the National Academy of Medicine, recognizing his contributions to health policy. His leadership appointments have included serving as President of the American Academy of Pain Medicine, chair of the Board of Deans for the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine, and co-chair for the Blue-Ribbon Commission for the Advancement of Osteopathic Medical Education. Hahn's textbook, \"Regional Anesthesia: An Atlas of Anatomy and Technique,\" earned acclaim as the Best New Textbook in Clinical Medicine by the Association of American Publishers.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHahn and his wife Robin live in Kansas City, Missouri, and have two adult children who serve the community as specialists in health policy and philanthropic/community engagement.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Hampton Branch was a railway line in the state of New Jersey. It ran 5.2 miles (8.4 km) from Hampton, New Jersey, to Washington, New Jersey, connecting the main line of the Central Railroad of New Jersey with the old main line of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (Lackawanna). It was built by the Warren Railroad in 1853–1856 and abandoned by the Lackawanna in 1958.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nInterests behind the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, a Pennsylvania company, established the Warren Railroad in 1851 to construct a railway line from the Delaware Water Gap to Hampton, New Jersey. The line would connect the main line of the Lackawanna, then being extended south from Scranton, Pennsylvania, toward the Delaware Water Gap, with the main line of the Central Railroad of New Jersey at Hampton.\nThe full line opened on May 26, 1858, enabling through service between Scranton and Elizabethport, New Jersey. The Lackawanna leased the Warren Railroad on October 1, 1857. The Morris and Essex Railroad extended its main line west from Hackettstown to Phillipsburg in November 1865, crossing the Warren Railroad's line at Washington. The Lackawanna leased the Morris and Essex on December 31, 1868.\nWith the lease, the Morris and Essex's main line replaced the Central Railroad of New Jersey as the Lackawanna's outlet to New York, and the importance of the Warren Railroad's line between Washington and Hampton lessened. Lackawanna through traffic over the CNJ ended on April 1, 1875. \nPassenger service between Washington and Hampton ended on September 18, 1926. The Interstate Commerce Commission granted the Lackawanna permission to abandon the line on July 11, 1958.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nInterstate Commerce Commission (1932). \"Interstate Commerce Commission Reports: Decisions of the Interstate Commerce Commission of the United States.

Her mother was known as Sgouromallini and her siblings were Nikolaos, Andreas, Eleftheroussa and Anthousa.\nShe was captured during the Battle of Anopolis and given as a wife to the Pasha's interpreter, Abdulsamet Pasha. She and her husband then went to Constantinople where he had a house and property. When her Ottoman husband died, Maria went to Tinos and became a nun.\nWhen the revolution of 1821 burst out, she offered all the money to buy a nephew of hers a war ship and strengthen the struggle.\nShe died in Tinos in 1823 and as much property as she had left, as she had no children, she left it to Evangelistria of Tinos.\n\n\n== Referneces ==",

Finson then stayed in Provence on the way back to the Netherlands (1613-1615). The work is a copy of Caravaggio's work on the same subject, one of several of Finson's works on that subject. A work rediscovered in Toulouse in 2014 is thought to either be an earlier version of that work by Caravaggio or an earlier version of Finson's work now in Naples.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Herb Williams (born Herbert Schussler Billerbeck; May 24, 1884 – October 1, 1936) was an American pianist, comic entertainer in vaudeville, and actor.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nBorn in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Herbert Billerbeck trained as a classical pianist at the Philadelphia Conservatory of Music.  As an amateur performer he teamed up with singer Hilda Wolfus, and the pair performed as a comic duo, Williams and Wolfus, marrying in 1909.   They developed a vaudeville act that played on their physical differences (he was heavy and ungainly, she was thin), and performed various surreal and comedic acts such as him eating her earrings, producing beer or chickens from their trick piano which then fell to pieces, and so forth.  They first appeared at the Palace Theatre in New York City in 1915.\nAfter Williams and Wolfus split up in 1926, Williams performed solo, assisted by his second wife, Jean Halpin. He was a popular headline act in vaudeville from the mid-1920s to the mid-1930s.  In addition, he appeared in the 1930 version of The Earl Carroll Vanities, and in the 1934 play The Farmer Takes a Wife.  He also featured in the 1936 film Rose of the Rancho.\nHe died in Freeport, New York, in 1936, from pneumonia at the age of 52.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jens Westphalen (* 1964 in Hamburg) is a German wildlife filmmaker, director and film producer. His documentaries have received many awards.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nJens Westphalen grew up in Hamburg-Langenhorn. During his childhood and youth he was interested in animals and nature, photography and film. This also led to his early desire to become a wildlife filmmaker.\nAfter graduating from high school in Heidberg, Jens Westphalen traveled through South America for a year and gained his first experiences as a professional photographer. Jens Westphalen then did community service and then studied biology at the University of Hamburg. Jens Westphalen then worked as a nature photographer in Africa, Asia, Europe and South America, mainly during the semester breaks. While studying biology, Jens Westphalen met his fellow student Thoralf Grospitz. He began making his first nature films with him before he finished his studies. They later founded the production company Zorillafilm. Animal and nature films such as “Die Nordsee (The North Sea)”, “Wildes Japan (Wild Japan)” and the “Australien (Australia)” series have been made since 1993. The documentaries portray natural areas such as “Polens Osten (Poland's East)”, “Borneo's Secret Kingdom” and “Wildes Hamburg (Wild Hamburg)” or animal species such as African elephants, dingoes, red kangaroos and sea turtles. But Jens Westphalen is not only taken with large and exotic animals: in 2003 the film “Die frechen Spatzen von Berlin (The Cheeky Sparrows of Berlin)” was made.\nIn addition to various European countries, these include: Costa Rica, India, Sri Lanka, New Zealand, Australia, Borneo, Namibia, Zambia, Botswana and Japan are Jens Westphalen's filming locations. On his film trips he usually travels for months and often in remote areas with his film partner Thoralf Grospitz.\n\nNumerous documentaries have received nominations and awards at international film festivals and television awards. In 2011, the two-parter “Wild Japan” received a nomination for Best Documentary at the International Emmy Award. Other films also received honors: For example, the film “Australien – im Reich der Riesenkängurus (Australia – in the realm of the giant kangaroos)” won the Deutschen Naturfilmpreis (German Nature Film Prize), the “Best Camera” award at the Green Screen Nature Film Festival, “Best Film” at the Animal Behavior Society and the “Grand Prix” at the Matsalu International Nature Film Festival. Films have also received awards at the New York Festivals several times. Jens Westphalen is therefore one of the most renowned German nature filmmakers. His films are characterized by unusual perspectives, extreme slow motion, aerial shots and epic landscape images.\nJens Westphalen and his film partner Thoralf Grospitz have established themselves on the international television market with their productions and work together with television stations and production companies such as ARD, ZDF, NDR, WDR, BR, Arte, ORF, Deutsche Welle, NDR Naturfilm Doclights, National Geographic Channel, Terra Mater Factual Studios and Wildbear Entertainment.\nJens Westphalen's documentaries are shown in Germany, among others, in the ARD series Erlebnis Erde (Experience Earth) and in the NDR series Expeditionen ins Tierreich(Expeditions into the Animal Kingdom). He also worked for the children's series Die Sendung mit der Maus (The Show with the Mouse) and Löwenzahn (Dandelion).\nJens Westphalen lives with his family in Hamburg.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n1994: Halali im Nationalpark, für den NDR\n1995: Lippenbären und wilde Büffel – Nationalparks in Sri Lanka, für den NDR\n1996: Wo die Biber Burgen bauen, für NDR und Deutsche Welle Transtel\n1997: Invasion aus dem Meer (Costa Rica), für NDR und Deutsche Welle Transtel\n1997: Helgoland – Vogelparadies auf steilen Klippen, für den NDR\n1999: Die bunten Vögel vom Rhein, für WDR\n1999: Sylt - Von Seehunden und Seeschwalben, für NDR\n1999: Wamba der Waschbär, 7 Teile, für die Sendung mit der Maus\n2000: Moa - Das Rätsel der Riesenvögel, für ZDF\n2002: Vorsicht Dingos!

        "content": "The Death of Saint Alexius or Saint Alexius Dying is a c.1638 oil on canvas painting by Pietro da Cortona in the Saint Alexis chapel in the Girolamini, Naples. It shows the dying saint Alexius of Rome holding a letter welcomed by angels — he had left his family and returned to them at the moment of his death, with them only recognising him thanks to the letter addressed to them.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was commissioned by Anna Colonna, wife of Taddeo Barberini, nephew of pope Urban VIII, and later given to the Oratorians of Naples with other relics and precious objects. The Barberini family had a particular devotion to Alexius, so much so that the opening show at their Palazzo's theatre was a sacred drama on that saint's life written by Giulio Rospigliosi with sets designed by da Cortona. Anna Colonna was deeply linked with the Oratorians' founder Philip Neri, owning a small bone of his in a reliquary by Alessandro Algardi, which she later gave to the Oratory in Naples. Da Cortona was also highly devoted to the Barberini family and the Oratorians in Rome, painting frescoes at the gallery of their palazzo (1633—1639) and working on the sacristy of the Oratorians' chiesa Nuova in Rome, later returning to the latter in 1648—1665 to take part in decorating the church.\nThe painting was installed in Anna's private chapel and completed economically by the Oratorians with wooden and stucco decorations imitating marble. Mario Borrelli records a transcription of a contract for Francesco Solimena to decorate the chapel and produce paintings for it — that lacked the family coat of arms and the presence of very little furniture in it suggests that the contract was not concluded or that it was resolved by him and the Oratorians.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hinche Parham Mabry Jr., also known as \"Hinchie\" Mabry and H.P. Mabry (October 27, 1829 – March 21, 1884) was a Texas lawyer, state legislator, judge, and brigade commander in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. After joining the Confederate army, Mabry was promoted to colonel and assigned command of a cavalry brigade in Forrest's Cavalry Corps. Mabry's brigade fought against Union forces in Mississippi until the late stages of the war. During Reconstruction, Mabry returned to his home in Jefferson, Texas, where he was the leader of a KKK-style terror organization called the Knights of the Rising Sun. Mabry was implicated in lynchings committed by the group in 1868, but he was never prosecuted.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nH.P. Mabry Jr. was born in Carroll County, Georgia on October 27, 1829. He studied at the University of Tennessee and moved to Jefferson, Texas after university, where he studied law and was admitted to the Texas bar in 1856. Mabry was elected to the Texas State Legislature during the 6th session in 1855, and the 8th session in 1859, representing Cass and Titus counties.\n\n\n== Civil War ==\nAt the outbreak of war, Mabry joined the Confederate army, and took part in an expedition to Indian Territory in May 1861 to capture Fort Washita and Fort Arbuckle, which had been abandoned by Union forces. Mabry became captain of Company G of the 3rd Texas Cavalry Regiment in June, 1861. The 3rd Cavalry fought at the Battle of Wilson's Creek in Missouri and the Battle of Pea Ridge in Arkansas. While on a scouting mission to Springfield, Missouri, Mabry and another Confederate captain were surrounded by a group of 7 Union soldiers and told to surrender. Fearing execution as a spy, Mabry and the other officer fought off the soldiers with bowie knives and revolvers, killing 7 and wounding others, and managed to escape.\nMabry was promoted to Colonel of the 3rd Texas Cavalry in July, 1862. At the Battle of Iuka, he was wounded and captured. Southerners captured at Iuka were paroled after capture if they would sign a statement that included the phrase: \"so-called Confederate States,\" Mabry balked at this wording as an insult to the Confederacy and refused to sign. He was not released until 1863.\nMabry rejoined his regiment, and was assigned temporary command of Lawrence Sullivan Ross's cavalry brigade during the Meridian campaign, before receiving command of his own brigade in 1864. Mabry's brigade consisted of the 4th Mississippi Cavalry, the 6th Mississippi Cavalry, the 38th Mississippi Mounted Infantry, the 14th Confederate (Louisiana and Mississppi) Regiment, the 14th and 16th consolidated Arkansas regiment, and an Arkansas artillery battery. General S.D. Lee commended Mabry's leadership, writing in 1864: \"I cannot speak in too high terms of Colonel Mabry; he is one of the most gallant and best brigade commanders in the service.\"\nMabry's brigade joined General Nathan Bedford Forrest's cavalry corps and took part in numerous actions across Mississippi, capturing a Union gunboat, the USS Petrel, in April, and fighting at the Battle of Tupelo in July. Forrest's cavalry, including Mabry's brigade, took heavy casualties during this battle, of which Forrest wrote: \"The battle of Harrisburg [Tupelo] will furnish the historian a bloody record, but it will also stamp with immortality the gallant dead and the living heroes it has made.\"\nIn a March 1865 reorganization, Mabry's brigade was broken up and the units comprising it were reassigned. Forrest wrote that he \"desire[d] to express his entire satisfaction with the manner in which Colonel Mabry has discharged the duties of his position while under his command.\" Mabry returned as commander of the 3rd Texas Cavalry under General Lawrence Sullivan Ross's brigade. Mabry surrendered at Shreveport, Louisiana on June 22, 1865.\nH.P. Mabry's highest confirmed rank in the war was colonel, though he is often referred to as a general.  Typically, the officer commanding a brigade as Mabry did would be promoted to brigadier general, but there is no record that Mabry ever received a general's commission. A contributor to Confederate Veteran magazine wrote in 1911, \"There was not in the Confederate army, perhaps, a man who commanded a brigade as long as Colonel Mabry without promotion.\"\n\n\n== Reconstruction ==\nAfter the war, Mabry returned to his home of Jefferson, Texas, where he joined the 1866 Texas constitutional convention and was elected to a judgeship, but he was removed from office during Reconstruction for his Confederate ties. During this period, East Texas was a major center of opposition to Reconstruction, and there were numerous outbreaks of racial violence against the newly emancipated Black population. Mabry became a leader of the Knights of the Rising Sun, a local white supremacist terror organization similar to the Ku Klux Klan.\nIn October 1868, former Union officer from New York and prominent Republican, George Washington Smith was involved in a shoot-out with locals who had tried to ambush him after a Republican meeting in Jefferson. Smith, along with four Black men involved in the local Republican party, were arrested for assault, and Smith was lynched by a mob led by the Knights of the Rising Sun, who overpowered the guards and broke into the local jail. Two of the Black men arrested with Smith, Lewis Grant and Richard Stewart, were also killed, and two others escaped after being wounded. The Knights then rampaged through Jefferson and the outlying areas, terrorizing the local Black community. After suspects were brought to trial for the murders, one of the defendants implicated Mabry, who was acting as a defense attorney in the trial. A grand jury indicted Mabry for murder, he then fled to Canada to avoid prosecution. Mabry later returned to Texas and was never prosecuted for the murders. Like many other perpetrators of racial violence in the Reconstruction era, Mabry suffered no consequences for his actions, and his 1884 obituary only remembered him as a \"distinguished soldier, citizen, and jurist.\"\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nH.P. Mabry married Sarah Abigail Haywood in 1854, and the couple had 3 children, including Woodford Mabry, who became adjutant general of Texas and a prominent leader of the Texas Rangers.  Camp Mabry near Austin is named after Woodford Mabry. After the Civil War, H.P. Mabry and his wife opened a hotel in Jefferson, Texas, known as the Haywood House, and the historic structure has been preserved and renovated. \nIn 1879 Mabry moved to Fort Worth, Texas, and died of sepsis on March 21, 1884, after being wounded in the foot by an accidental firearm discharge. Mabry was buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Jefferson.\nFormerly, there was a historical marker in Fort Worth dedicated to Mabry. The marker glorified his wartime service, making no mention of his involvement with white supremacist organizations or the post-war lynchings. This marker was removed in 2017 and given to the Texas Civil War Museum.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is based on the value of products directly supplied by the ecosystem, the value of its regulating services (such as climate regulation), and the value of cultural services like tourism. A country level standard was launched in China in 2020. As of 2023, 15 local governments have issued guidelines using GEP, and around 200 projects have been launched. An example of its use is in measuring performance of local officials. The first province to issue local rules using GEP was Zhejiang in China. For example, the GEP of Chengtian Radon Spring Nature Reserve has been calculated as US$43 million.\n\n\n== References ==",

It developed digital collectible card game Gods Unchained and role-playing video game Guild of Guardians.\n\n\n== History ==\nFounded in 2018 by Robbie Ferguson, James Ferguson and Alex Connolly, the company developed crypto platform \"Immutable X\" based on blockchain Ethereum. Immutable partnered with Israeli company StarkWare for their \"layer 2\", \"zero knowledge roll up\" network in 2020. Immutable X has partnered with GameStop, Kongregate, Ubisoft and ESL.\n\n\n== Gods Unchained ==\nGods Unchained is a collectible trading card game with a non-fungible token (NFT) for each card for Android, iOS, Microsoft Windows and MacOS. It was directed by Chris Clay, former game director of Magic: The Gathering Arena.At the time of layoffs in July 2022, the number of unique players logging into the game was 10 000, down from 22 000 in April, according to a third-party tracking site Cards Unchained.\nIn December 2023, the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) rated the game and Striker Manager 3 \"Adults Only 18+\" (AO), assessing \"whether products may reward real money, prizes with real world value, or something that can be exchanged for or converted to real money (i.e., gift cards, cryptocurrency, etc.), as well as whether there is cash spent to be eligible for such rewards.\" (Blockchain games such as poker game Polker have not received an Adults Only rating) The game was removed from the Epic Games Store after the rating, but reinstated following Epic Games updating its content policy to allow such crypto games.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"Gods Unchained NFT trading card game is giving GameStop PowerUp Rewards Pros free expansion packs\".

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Gloster House is a Georgian-Palladian country house operating as a hotel and wedding venue near Brosna, County Offaly, Ireland. The design of the house has sometimes been attributed to the architect Edward Lovett Pearce who was a cousin of the owner, Trevor Lloyd, at the time the main house was constructed around 1720 – although no firm evidence of this survives.\nThe house continued to be owned and occupied by the Lloyd family until 1958 when it was sold to the Salesian order to house a school and nursing home. The house changed hands again twice in the 1990s and, having deteriorated over time, was purchased by the current owners in 2001 and subsequently restored.\nThe English sounding name of the property and townland 'Gloster' (phonically identical to Gloucester) has its origins in an anglicized version of the name of the original townland, Glasderrymore (Irish: Glasdoire Mór – big green oak wood).\n\n\n== House and interior ==\nThe original main house is a detached 13-bay, 2-storey over basement property constructed almost entirely in the Georgian era, with the initial house taking shape around 1720 before major extension works took place around 1780 to provide for an additional three-bay breakfront and recessed flanking bays. The house, which has sandstone dressings and ornamentation, is described in the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage as being less austere and more \"playful\" than other Georgian houses of the era.\nThe main house was constructed in limestone ashlar with sandstone dressing ornamentation and architrave surrounds and pediments as well as fluted pilasters, plinth course, string course, quoins and parapet with balustrade. The window surrounds also contain carved mascarons while the main door frame includes a carved crest of the Lloyd family.\nThe interior of the property contains a double height entrance hall with original pieces of Georgian stucco work. Niches contain marbles and plaster busts while an arcaded balcony over looks the hall and links by a barrel vaulted corridor to other upstairs rooms in the house.\nThe contents of the house were also sold in their entirety in an auction over three days from Tuesday 28 October 1958. A number of items, including original fireplaces and paintings, were stripped from the building.\n\n\n=== Gloster arch folly ===\nThe Gloster arch folly in the grounds of the house, which is also attributed to Edward Lovett Pearce, was constructed in limestone rubble and lime mortar and includes a pedimented archway and flanking obelisks on plinths. It and was constructed at the same time as the initial house around 1730. The structure was restored with the help of the Folly Trust in 2018 when the ivy was removed and now sits at the end of a vista from the house.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Medhop and Lloyd families ===\nKing Charles I granted the lands at Glasderrymore to the Medhop (or Midhop) family some time in the early 1600s. The name of the area was anglicised as Gloster around this time.\nThere are records of the Lloyd family living at Gloster since 1639 when Trevor Lloyd married Margaret Rose Medhop. Further lands were assigned to the Lloyd family, in 1666, following the English Restoration. In 1696, their son Medhop Lloyd married Hannah Lovett, daughter of Christopher Lovett, a former Lord Mayor of Dublin and had 14 children including Trevor Lloyd. \nA house was originally constructed in the 17th century on the site. Some historians, including Maurice Craig, believe  but that it was almost entirely rebuilt in its current form around 1720 by Trevor Lloyd III, whose cousin, the architect Edward Lovett Pearce, was likely engaged to assist in the design of a grander and more fashionable Georgian Palladian-style residence. The house was again further extended and embellished around 1780 while the Lloyd family continued to live in the same house for the next 180 years.\nIn the early 1780s, Colonel Hardress Lloyd is recorded as being born at the house as the eldest son of John Lloyd MP for King's County.\nIn 1797, John Lloyd's daughter Alice married Lawrence Parsons, 2nd Earl of Rosse of nearby Birr Castle.\n\n\n=== Sale to the Salesian order ===\nIn 1958, the house was sold to the Salesian order by the Major Evan T. Trevor Lloyd and the main house was converted into a convent and nursing home while modern school buildings were constructed in the grounds to the rear and many of the old farm buildings were demolished. The contents of the house were also sold off at auction.\nThe house and buildings operated as a secondary school mainly for female borders but closed in 1990. Shortly thereafter the house fell into further disrepair.\n\n\n=== Macra na Feirme ownership ===\nThe house was acquired by Macra na Feirme in 1991 and was briefly under its management before it was sold.\n\n\n=== Edward Haughey ownership ===\nThe businessman and politician, Edward Haughey, Baron Ballyedmond bought the house in 1993. Few changes or improvements were made to the property during his period of ownership.\n\n\n=== Hotel and wedding venue ===\nIn 2001, the house was purchased by Tom and Mary Alexander who slowly restored the house and converted it into a hotel and wedding venue over a period of a decade. \n\n\n== Notable visitors ==\nJohn Wesley was recorded as preaching at the house on Tuesday 13 June 1749. Of his visit, which took place during a tour of Ireland, Wesley reputedly wrote of the \"splendour\" of the house.\nNellie Melba performed at the house, in the early 20th century, during a visit to Ireland.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBirr Castle\nCharleville Castle\nDamer House\nKinnitty Castle\nLeap Castle\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "X-Men: Grand Design is an American comic book series by Ed Piskor featuring the X-Men and published by Marvel Comics in 2018–2019. The series — composed of three 2-issue limited series — abridges and condenses four decades of X-Men-related canon from 1963 to the late 1980s.\nPiskor wrote, drew, colored, and lettered X-Men: Grand Design, which was described as the first superhero comic by a single creator that Marvel had published since Rick Veitch's The One in 1985–1986.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nPiskor, whose previous published comics were in the alternative comics vein, described the project as an \"adaptation\" and as a \"remix\".  As the series was described in Bleeding Cool, Piskor's goal was to tell \"the story of the X-Men as if it were all planned out from the beginning. Each chapter condenses a decade of X-Men adventures into a single comic....\"\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nAs a child, Piskor drew \"hundreds of pages\" of X-Men stories. With X-Men: Grand Design he \"tasked himself with piecing together a cohesive narrative from a series created by dozens of artists and writers over the course of decades.\" The series was originally shepherded by Marvel editor-in-chief Axel Alonso, \"who let the cartoonist retell one of the most beloved and longest-lived superhero series through the filter of alternative comics.\" (Alonso left Marvel, however, before the series was published.)X-Men: Grand Design was published as three separate two-issue limited series in 2018 and 2019: \n\nX-Men: Grand Design (2 issues, Feb–Mar 2018)\nX-Men: Grand Design — Second Genesis (2 issues, Sep–Oct 2018)\nX-Men: Grand Design — X-Tinction (2 issues, Jul–Aug 2019)Individual issues included \"Additional Reading\" sections by Daron Jensen and Jeph York that functioned as bibliographies.All six issues were collected in 2020 and published by Marvel as Marvel Omnibus: X-Men: Grand Design (ISBN 978-1302925246). The series was collected again in 2023 as X-Men: Grand Design Trilogy (ISBN 978-1-302-95724-7). The second collection was translated and published in France (Panini France) and Brazil (Panini Brasil).\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn general, the plot of X-Men: Grand Design follows that of the original X-Men comics, as written primarily by Stan Lee and then Chris Claremont.The first series of X-Men: Grand Design covers the Silver Age X-Men period, roughly 1963 to 1970. The plot focuses on the back stories of Namor, Professor X, Cain Marko, and Magneto; and the original team of Cyclops, Marvel Girl, Beast, Angel, and Iceman; along with the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants featuring Mastermind, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, and Toad. A running subplot involves anti-mutant hysteria and the activities of Robert Kelly, Bolivar Trask, Larry Trask, and the Sentinels; as well as Cameron Hodge and The Right.\nThe second series, Second Genesis, covers the introduction of the \"New X-Men,\" made up of Cyclops, Colossus, Nightcrawler, Storm, Thunderbird, Banshee, Sunfire, and Wolverine. Second Genesis #2 features The Dark Phoenix Saga, and covers the X-Men's encounters with the Shi'ar, the Brood, and the Starjammers, as well as the inaugural X-Men adventures of Kitty Pryde and Carol Danvers. The character of Madelyne Pryor is substantially rewritten in Second Genesis #2. Madelyne debuts and participates in stories that originally featured Lee Forrester, who is entirely excluded in this retelling (but is name-dropped later in the series' final panel). When Madelyne and Scott Summers meet and begin their relationship, Madelyne is not a pilot in Alaska but is still described as surviving a plane crash in the past, and Mastermind's manipulations of Madelyne never happen before she and Scott marry.The third series, X-Tinction, tracks storylines such as the 1986 \"Mutant Massacre\" and 1988's \"The Fall of the Mutants\" as well as the return of Jean Grey, the trial of Magneto, and the 1990 storyline \"X-Tinction Agenda\". Madelyne Pryor's history continues in the first half of X-Tinction, starting with the birth of Nathan Summers and the marriage's disintegration, to concluding at her death during the \"Inferno\" storyline. Most of the rest of her story with the X-Men is here. Madelyne is emphasized as the victim in everything, not culpable for \"Inferno\" nor intending to harm her son. Her death is presented as more accidental instead of suicide.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nPiskor was nominated for the 2018 Eisner Award for Best Coloring for X-Men: Grand Design.X-Men: Grand Design — Second Genesis won the 2019 Dragon Award for Best Graphic Novel.The Comics Journal gave the first two series a mixed review. Critic Martin Brown wrote, \"The best thing that Grand Design has done to date is the very first thing that it did: it reframes the X-Men's story as a philosophical showdown between Professor X and Magneto.\" But Brown complained that in the end, Piskor found it...\n\n\"difficult to completely reject a milieu while drawing inspiration from it. Add that to the list of other contradictions embodied by Grand Design, and you have a book completely at odds with itself. Piskor seems to undercut himself at every turn, which tends to be the mark of a creator who lacks a unifying vision.... Piskor promises nothing if not coherence; he demands creative control, works in isolation, and eliminates direct ties to the source material, like asterisks and annotated bibliographies; and then he abdicates the responsibility to deliver on his one promise. That’s the failure of Grand Design: Piskor sells himself as an auteur, but he doesn’t really have anything to say. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n X-Men: Grand Design at the Grand Comics Database\n X-Men: Grand Design — Second Genesis at the Grand Comics Database\n X-Men: Grand Design — X-Tinction at the Grand Comics Database",

        "content": "Manuel Cobo Vega (born 18 June 1956) is a Spanish People's Party (PP) politician.\nHe served in the Assembly of Madrid from 1991 to 2003, where he was finance minister. He followed his mentor Alberto Ruiz-Gallardón into the local politics of Madrid, as a member of the city council from 2003 to 2012. He was deputy mayor and briefly acting mayor of the city. Following ill health and a double lung transplant, he returned to politics in 2023 as a member of the Congress of Deputies.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in Ponferrada, Province of León, Cobo earned a law degree from the Complutense University of Madrid (1978), a diploma in business consultancy from Madrid's School of Legal Practice (1984) and a Master of Business Administration from ICADE in 1986.Cobo was elected to the Assembly of Madrid in 1991, and became secretary general of the People's Party (PP) group. Re-elected in 1995, he became the party's spokesman. He served as the finance minister in the government of Alberto Ruiz-Gallardón.In 2003, both Cobo and Ruiz-Gallardón made the move from regional to municipal politics, as deputy mayor and mayor of Madrid, respectively. Cobo was acting mayor from 22 to 27 December 2011, between his mentor's resignation and the inauguration of Ana Botella. He too left the city council early the following year, to become the management coordinator at IFEMA, the Madrid railway body. He turned down an offer to work in the Ministry of Justice, led by Ruiz-Gallardón, as he felt that he did not have the right profile for it.Cobo left his role at IFEMA in September 2015 and announced that December that he was quitting politics, for personal reasons. He was unable to take the seat in the Congress of Deputies that he had won in that year's general election for his native province's constituency; in 2017 he resigned shortly after being named in charge of an anti-corruption drive in the PP. The cause of his resignations was ill health from his smoking; after nearly losing the ability to speak, he underwent a double lung transplant in 2020.In April 2022, he was announced as part of the PP leadership of new leader Alberto Núñez Feijóo. He was named 7th on the PP list for the Madrid constituency in the 2023 Spanish general election, and was elected.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "23 de Maio Avenue (Portuguese: Avenida 23 de Maio), also known as Itororó Avenue (Avenida Itororó) or Anhangabaú Avenue (Avenida Anhangabaú), is located in the Brazilian city of São Paulo. It is the main route connecting the neighborhoods of the Vila Mariana subprefecture to the central region of the city and belongs to the North-South Corridor. It was named after the students Martins, Miragaia, Dráusio and Camargo, who died on May 23, 1932, during the Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Project ===\nIn 1927, former Mayor José Pires do Rio commissioned a road system from a group of urban planners, who suggested the \"valley floor theory\", which involved the creation of a network of avenues and radial and perimeter roads that would orient and structure the urban growth of the city of São Paulo using valley floor and lowland areas, composed of wetlands and areas of low real estate value. Until then, the city favored long avenues, such as Paulista, Doutor Arnaldo and Lins de Vasconcelos. In the same year, one of the pavilions of the Taco de Ouro Factory on Pedroso Street was expropriated for the upcoming construction work. The remains of the warehouse remained abandoned for many years due to the delay in starting work.\nThe project for the avenue dates from 1937; in 1940, it already featured on the Guia Levi maps. The original project only envisaged a connection between the city center and Ibirapuera Park; in 1958, it was included in the Urban Diametral Expressway Plan under the name 23 de Maio Avenue, established by Ordinary Law number 4,473 of May 22, 1954.\nThe original project included widened central medians for a future metro line, wider lanes, less steep ramps and the creation of a \"green belt\" eighteen meters wide on each side of the lanes. At the time, the capacity of the avenue was expected to be around 4,000 vehicles per hour in each direction.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\nWork began in 1951 on the 200-meter stretch between Bandeira Square and the Dona Paulina Viaduct, which was used for many years as a parking lot as it had no exit. By 1961, the plan was to include Assembleia Street, as the costs of expropriating properties beyond that point exceeded the budget for the project that year by 1,900%.\n\nThe São Paulo City Hall faced many difficulties with expropriations, as most of the land to be removed consisted of valley bottoms and backyard areas, restricted by law. The decree expropriating the stretch comprising Jaceguai, Conde de São Joaquim, Condessa de São Joaquim and Liberdade streets was published on November 12, 1960. In 1962, a new decree expropriated an area of around 8,000 to 9,000 square meters covering the block between Cubatão, Estela, Oscar Porto and Tomás Carvalhal streets, where the tunnel that would pass under Largo Guanabara would terminate. However, the tunnel was built in the open at a lower level than the nearby streets until it reached the vicinity of Coronel Oscar Porto Street. \nAnother problem were the structures that already stood on or next to the route, such as the garages of the Municipal Funeral Service, which occupied the lower part of the Dona Paulina Viaduct, and the large foundations of the planned headquarters of the Department of Highways, located next to the Mauá Palace. The lack of asphalt on the market also affected the pace of construction. In 1961, former Mayor Prestes Maia announced the resumption of work on the avenue, but was criticized by people who thought the Radial Leste was more important. Due to a delay in receiving taxes for 1962, he prioritized other works, but made the necessary expropriations between Assembleia and Paraíso streets. \nIn November 1963, the City Hall announced that it possessed all the land required to build the avenue. On September 9, 1964, the public notice for the construction of the Condessa de São Joaquim Viaduct was published, with expected investment of R$250 million. One of the buildings demolished was the Church of Santa Generosa, which was located in the old Rodrigues de Abreu Square. The Santa Generosa Viaduct was approved for construction at the end of November 1967. The initial 1,400-meter section, extending from Bandeira Square to the Pedroso Viaduct, began operating on January 25, 1967. In the same month, tenders were opened for the construction of the Rua do Paraíso Viaduct. \nOn July 8, 1966, the Condessa de Joaquim Viaduct was the first to be inaugurated. Humaitá Street, the only link between Vergueiro Street and Brigadeiro Luís Antônio Avenue, was interrupted with the opening of the new viaduct. On May 29, 1967, the Pedroso Viaduct was delivered. In August 1968, the Beneficência Portuguesa Viaduct was built. \n\n\n=== Operation ===\n\nSome stretches of the avenue, such as between Bandeira Square and Paraíso, and Cubatão Street and Ibirapuera Park, were already in operation and in use. The official inauguration took place on January 25, 1969, with some provisional details. In the 1970s, due to poorly designed curves and bad sidewalk, the avenue was considered dangerous and around ten people died every month on average during that time.\nOn January 25, 2004, the avenue was closed to traffic for the city's 450th anniversary celebrations. In 2010, 23 de Maio Avenue was the second highest for accidents involving motorcyclists in São Paulo. In January 2008, an exclusive motorcycle lane was tested. However, after two days, congestion on the road had doubled and the tests ended after the third day. In July 2010, after the opening of the motorcycle lane on Vergueiro Street, it was discussed banning motorcycles on the avenue, but the Secretary of Transportation, Marcelo Cardinale Branco, halted the proposal. Besides the speed cameras on poles on the road, the Companhia de Engenharia de Tráfego (CET) installed two cameras on the Tutoia and Pedroso viaducts in 2011. \n\nOn August 5, 2013, the avenue gained exclusive bus lanes. The lane started operating from Monday to Friday and intended to reduce bus travel times on the North-South Corridor. The following week, the City Hall announced that cars invading the lane would be fined; the infraction was considered light and the amount was R$53.20. On the first day, 708 fines were levied on the North-South Corridor, most of them in the stretch comprising avenues Vinte e Três de Maio, Moreira Guimarães, Rubem Berta and Washington Luís. \nAfter the first week of the corridor's operation, the Companhia de Engenharia de Tráfego (CET) reported that bus speeds had increased by around 40% to 50%, while car speeds had fallen by around 5%. Época magazine considered that the implementation of bus lanes in the city was one of the reasons for Mayor Fernando Haddad's fall in popularity, due to the perception of increased traffic. At the end of the year, the São Paulo City Hall announced a plan for the North-South BRT, which would include viaducts to allow buses traveling on Vinte e Três de Maio to access other avenues in the Ibirapuera region, such as Ibirapuera, Professor Ascendino Reis and Pedro Álvares Cabral.\n\n\n=== Features ===\n\nBuilt over the old Itororó Stream, 23 de Maio Avenue is an divided highway with a total width of 80 meters. It passes under Paulista Avenue at the height of Bernardino de Campos Avenue at a depth of 12 meters. It is named in homage to the day on which four students, two from the Faculty of Law of the University of São Paulo and two from the Polytechnic School of the University of São Paulo, Martins, Miragaia, Dráusio and Camargo, were killed during the Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932.\nThe Dona Paulina, Condessa de São Joaquim and Pedroso viaducts have an internal structure whose original function was to house future metro stations for the Metro's North-South Line project, which would run in the open air along the avenue's wide central median. The Dona Paulina Viaduct houses the Municipal Funeral Service; the Condessa de São Joaquim, which used to be a hostel, houses homeless families; and the Pedroso Viaduct still functions as a shelter maintained since 1996 by the Methodist Community of Street People.\nThe speed limit on the avenue, set at 80 kilometers per hour in November 1970, was lowered to 70 kilometers per hour in February 2010. The stretch of the avenue between the Dona Paulina Viaduct and the Anhangabaú tunnel has a speed limit of 60 kilometers per hour because it curves.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTourism in the city of São Paulo\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Why Mr. Nation Wants a Divorce is a 1901 silent short comedy film directed by Edwin S. Porter and George S. Fleming. It is a satire on the activities of radical temperance advocate Carrie Nation, who was known for her crusade against bars and taverns. Earlier in 1901, Porter directed another film mocking Nation, Kansas Saloon Smashers; this follow-up film was inspired by news reports that Nation's husband demanded a divorce.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nMr. Nation is seen at home, dressed in a nightshirt and cap, taking care of two children in a bedroom. A sign over the mantelpiece reads \"What is Home Without a Mother\". In the crib, an infant is crying, and Mr. Nation tries to comfort the baby, picking it up and pacing around the room to quiet the child. The older child gets out of bed, and the man scolds the child, administering a couple of quick spanks on the bottom before bundling the kid back into bed.\nOverwrought, Mr. Nation picks up a newspaper, and is outraged to read about his wife's political activities. He crumples up the paper and throws it into the fireplace. He gives the crying baby a bottle, and then, seeking his own liquid refreshment, he reaches under his pillow to retrieve a bottle of whiskey for himself.\nA severe Mrs. Nation enters the room, catching her husband taking a swig of whiskey. Outraged, she smacks him, and then pulls him over her knee to administer a humiliating spanking.\n\n\n== Production ==\nCritics surmise that Mrs. Nation was played by a male actor.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn Sex Seen: The Emergence of Modern Sexuality in America, Sharon R. Ullman wrote that \"this satire attacked on several fronts at once, assaulting not only famed temperance reformer Carrie Nation but also Prohibition as a cause, women who deserted their children for social housekeeping activities, and men who permitted themselves to be 'infantilized' by their wives' behavior.\" Kay Sloan in The Loud Silents agrees that the film's message was that \"the temperance workers defied the 'proper' place for women, bullying their weaker husbands and ignoring their children in their crusade to save the American family.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nEdwin S. Porter filmography\n\n\n== References ==",

It is in 53 Tone Equal Temperament.\n\n\n== Kürdî in 53-TET ==\n\nThe Kürdî makam has a higher extension, starting from Muhayyer, with the steps of the Kürdî tetrachord. The notes in that case are Muhayyer, Sümbüle, Tiz Çârgah, Tiz Neva.\nThis is equivalent to having a Buselik makam on top of Neva.\n\n\n== Comparison with Western scales ==\nSince the makam is based on 53-TET, it is impossible to directly tie it to 12-TET Western scales. However, using the 48-TET model, while worse than many other models in approximation, allows for such comparisons.\nThe approximation of Acemli Rast within 48-TET would be: Phyrgian\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Animal husbandry in Afghanistan is a traditional way of life, which exists in all 34 provinces of the country, and plays an important role in the nation's economy. The livestock in Afghanistan mainly include sheep, cattle, and goats. All of these produce red meat and dairy products for local consumption. Weddings, zakats and the annual Eid al-Adha boost the sale of these animals. As a totally Islamic country, pig farming and consumption of pork are simply nonexistent. The wool of the slaughtered sheep is used to make Afghan rugs, clothing, and other products.\nAfter the completion of the major Qosh Tepa Canal and new dams, animal husbandry is likely to increase dramatically. Small number of people raise other animals in Afghanistan, such as camels, horses, ostriches, turkeys, peacocks, ducks, rabbits, and pigeons.\nPoultry farming is widespread in the warmer parts of the country. In 2022, there were over 10,000 poultry farms in the country. Some of the largest and modern ones are in the provinces of Balkh, Helmand, Kandahar, Khost and Nangarhar. Despite all of this, most chicken eggs in Afghanistan are still imported from neighboring Iran, Uzbekistan, and Pakistan. Large number of egg-laying chickens are also imported from Iran.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEconomy of Afghanistan\nMinistry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Leather industrialists demand raw hides processing factories\".

It is about King Nala (नल Nala) and his wife Damayanti (दमयन्ती Damayantī): Nala loses his kingdom in a game of dice and has to go into exile with his faithful wife Damayanti in the forest, where he leaves her. Separated from each other, the two have many adventures before they are finally reunited and Nala regains his kingdom.\nNala and Damayanti is one of the best known and most popular episodes of the Mahabharata. It has found a wide reception in India and is also regarded in the West as one of the most valuable works of Indian literature.\n\n\n== Content ==\nThe Mahabharata, a huge work of over 100,000 double verses, contains a large number of side episodes, some of which are nested within one another, in addition to the main story, which tells of the mythical battle between the Pandavas and Kauravas, two related princely families. Alongside the religious-philosophical didactic poem Bhagavad Gita and the Savitri legend, Nala and Damayanti is one of the best known of these episodes. It occurs in Aranyakaparvan, the third of 18 books of the epic and comprises around 1100 double verses (shlokas) in 26 chapters.\nIn the main narrative, Yudhishthira, the eldest of the five Pandava brothers, has just lost his kingdom to the Kauravas in a game of dice and had to go into exile with his brothers for twelve years. There, Yudhishtira meets the seer Brihadashva and asks him if there has ever been a more unfortunate man than himself, whereupon Brihadashva tells him the story of Nala, who also lost his kingdom in the dice game, but eventually regained it.\n\n\n=== Summary ===\nNala, the heroic son of Virasena, is king of Nishadha. At the same time, the beautiful Damayanti lives in Vidarbha at the court of her father, King Bhima. Nala and Damayanti hear of each other and fall in love without having seen each other. A wild goose sends Damayanti a message of love from Nala, whereupon she falls ill with longing. King Bhima realizes that the time has come for his daughter to get married. All the kings are summoned to the Svayamvara ceremony, at which Damayanti is to choose her husband herself. Even the gods Indra, Agni, Varuna and Yama set off for Vidarbha. On the way, they meet Nala and ask him to serve them as a messenger. Reluctantly, the king of Nishadha has to court the gods with Damayanti, whom he desires, but she confesses her love for Nala and vows to choose him as her husband. At the self-choice ceremony, Indra, Agni, Varuna and Yama try to outwit Bhima's daughter by assuming Nala's form, but she so fervently implores her love for the Nishadha king that the gods relent and reveal themselves. Damayanti chooses Nala, whereupon their wedding is celebrated. The two move into Vidarbha, where Nala reigns as a righteous king and Damayanti bears him two children.\nThe gods return to heaven and meet Dvapara and Kali, two demons of the game of dice, who are also on their way to Damayanti's self-election. When Kali learns that he is too late and that Damayanti has already chosen Nala, he swears revenge in a rage. He waits twelve years for his opportunity before he succeeds in taking possession of Nala. Possessed by the demon, the king enters into a game of dice with his brother Pushkara. Nala is not dissuaded by anyone's warnings and gambles away his kingdom and all his other possessions to his brother in a frenzy of dice. When Pushkara finally demands Damayanti as a stake, Nala gives up and moves into the forest penniless. His faithful wife follows him. The curse of the dice continues to haunt the king in the form of two birds that steal his robe. Tempted by the demon Kali, who still lives inside him, Nala leaves his wife secretly at night with a heavy heart.\nAbandoned by her husband, Damayanti wanders alone through the terrible forest in search of Nala. A hunter rescues her from a snake that threatens her life, but he in turn chases after her. After surviving many dangers and wailing through the forest, Damayanti joins a caravan and, after further adventures, reaches the land of Chedi, where she is taken in unrecognized by the Queen Mother at court. Meanwhile, in the forest, Nala has saved the Naga king Karkotaka from a forest fire. In return, he gives Nala a new form and advises him to go to King Rituparna in Ayodhya. Nala pretends to be the charioteer Vahuka and enters the service of Rituparna. He instructs the king in the art of horse driving and in return learns the secret of the dice from the king, so that the curse of the demon Kali is lifted from Nala.\nDamayanti's father Bhima sends Brahmins to search for Nala and his daughter. After the Brahmin Sudeva discovers Damayanti in Chedi, she returns to her father's house in Vidarbha. After three years of separation, Damayanti learns about Vahuka from a messenger who was searching for Nala in Ayodhya and suspects that he might be her husband. Damayanti conceives a trick and tells Rituparna that she will organize a new self-election. So the king sets off for Vidarbha and with him Nala as his charioteer. Because Nala believes that Damayanti has rejected him and wants to marry a new man, he does not reveal himself. Damayanti is confused by the strange form of Vahuka that Nala has assumed and asks to see the charioteer. Once she has ascertained that it is Nala, she calls him to her and convinces him of her noble motives. Nala returns to his true form and is now reunited with Damayanti.\nAfter a month, Nala moves to Nishadha, where he once again competes against Pushkara in the dice game and regains his kingdom. Nala magnanimously forgives his brother. He brings Damayanti home and lives happily with her as the ruler of Nishadha.\n\n\n== Classification in literary history ==\n\n\n=== Analysis and interpretation ===\nNala and Damayanti comprises 26 chapters, which display an artistic and deliberate composition: Through the introduction (chapters 1–5), which tells of Nala and Damayanti's love and marriage, the plot builds up to the three main parts: The loss of the kingdom in the dice game and Nala's banishment (chapters 6–10), Damayanti's adventures in the forest (chapters 11–13) and the events leading up to the reunion of the spouses (chapters 14–21). Finally, the story culminates in the happy union of Nala and Damayanti in the closing chapters (chapters 22–26).\nA turning point in the narrative is reached at the point where Nala secretly abandons the sleeping Damayanti. By abandoning his wife, who is entitled to care and protection, the king violates the commandment of \"law and custom\" (dharma) - a concept that plays a central role in Indian thought. Damayanti rightly complains: \"Don't you know what law and custom dictate? How could you leave me in my sleep and go away after you solemnly promised me (you would not leave me)?\" Nala's violation of dharma, however, allows the poet to portray Damayanti as the embodiment of the blameless wife who remains faithful to her husband even when he treats her unjustly. A very similar constellation can be found in the second great Indian epic, the Ramayana: here Sita, the wife of the hero Rama, is the epitome of the faithful wife. The motif of love in separation is very popular in Indian poetry. Alongside Nala and Damayanti and the Ramayana, it is also the subject of the most famous Indian drama, Kalidasa's Shakuntala.\nThe second main motif - the loss of possessions in a game of dice - also appears several times in Indian literature: in addition to the story of Nala, it also occurs in the main plot of the Mahabharata (with which the Nala episode is set in analogy) and is also found in the \"Song of Dice\" in the Rigveda, the oldest work of Indian literature.\n\n\n=== Origin and age ===\nThe Mahabharata combines many different elements of different origins and ages. The Nala episode clearly proves to be a deliberate form of interpolation due to the way it is embedded - the story of Nala is told to a protagonist of the main plot. The uniformity of content and structure shows Nala and Damayanti to be originally independent heroic poetry and remnants of an old bardic tradition. Only the monologue of the Brahmin Sudeva in the 16th chapter is a later insertion and comes from the Ramayana.\nThe question of the age of the Nala and Damayanti episode cannot be answered with any more certainty than the age of the Mahabharata. The epic was compiled between 400 BC and 400 AD, but the material used may be much older and partly depicts circumstances of the Vedic period (ca. 1400-600 BC). Within the Mahabharata, the Nala episode is probably \"one of the older, though not one of the oldest, parts\". Thus, only gods of the Vedic pantheon such as Indra, Agni, Varuna and Yama appear in the story, but not younger gods such as Vishnu and Shiva.\nThe Nala theme first appears in Indian literature in this episode of the Mahabharata. A \"King Nada from Nishidha\" (Naḍa Naiṣidha), who is certainly identical to \"Nala from Nishadha\", already appears in the Shatapatha Brahmana. Nada is said to \"carry the (god of death) Yama to the south day after day\". According to this, he could have been a king who lived at that time and undertook war campaigns to the south, which in turn points to the great age of the Nala legend.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Further use of the story ===\nNala and Damayanti has been widely received in India. Indian Kavya art poetry, which experienced a golden age in the 1st millennium AD., made use of well-known mythological material to embellish it artistically. The episode of Nala and Damayanti was also very popular. The most important adaptations of the material in chronological order are:\n\nThe collective work Kathakosha (\"Treasury of Tales\"), a work of Jaina literature by an unknown author, contains numerous other tales and legends as well as a Jain adaptation of the Nala and Damayanti story.\nThe art epic Nalodaya (\"Success of Nala\") also deals with the Nala episode. It has been handed down in four chants and was composed in the first half of the 9th century. The author is probably Ravideva, possibly Vasudeva. In the past, it was wrongly attributed to the famous poet Kalidasa.\nThe Nalachampu (\"Champu of Nala\") belongs to the Champu genre, a mixture of artistic prose and metrical poetry. The work is also known under the title Damayantikatha (\"Story of Damayanti\") and was written by Trivikramabhatta (around 900).\nThe Raghavanaishadhiya (\"[story] of the descendant of Raghu and the king of Nishadha\") by Haradatta Suri represents the genre of so-called \"crooked speech\" (vakrokti). Using the possibilities of double meaning available in Sanskrit, the work tells the story of Rama and Nala simultaneously in an almost linguistic acrobatic manner.\nThe collection of fairy tales Kathasaritsagara (\"Sea of Tales\"), which was written by Somadeva between 1063 and 1081, also tells a version of the Nala story.\nThe best-known adaptation is the Naishadhacharita (\"Deeds of the Nishadha King\"). This artistic epic describes the events leading up to Damayanti's self-election in 22 songs in an extremely artificial style. It was composed in the second half of the 12th century by Shriharsha in Kannauj.\nThe 15-chant epic poem Sahridayananda also deals with the Nala and Damayanti subject matter. It was probably written in the 13th century by Krishnananda, who also wrote a commentary on the Naishadhacharita.\nAnother adaptation of the story is the Nalabhyudaya, written by Vamanabhattabana in the 15th century.\nThere are two adaptations of the Nala story in Tamil literature: the Nalavenba by the author Pugalendi from the 13th/14th century and the Naidadam by Adivirarama Pandiyan from the second half of the 16th century.\nThe poet Faizi (1547–1595) made a Persian adaptation of the Nala story at the request of Emperor Akbar I\nThe story was made into numerous films in all major Indian languages under the title Nala Damayanti, first in 1920 with a silent film by the film company Madan Theatres directed by the Italian Eugenio de Liguoro with Patience Cooper as \"Damayanti\".\nNal'i Damajanti op. 47, opera in three acts by Anton Arensky, libretto by Modest Tchaikovsky (Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's brother), the Mahabharata in Vasily Zhukovsky's translation into Russian, premiere January 9 / January 22, 1904 in Moscow.\n\n\n=== Reception in the West ===\nIn the West, Nala and Damayanti is held in high esteem as \"one of the most charming creations of Indian poetry\". The German writer and Indologist August Wilhelm Schlegel commented on the work as follows:\"Here I will say only this much, that in my feeling this poem can hardly be surpassed in pathos and ethos, in ravishing force and tenderness of feeling. It is quite made to appeal to old and young, noble and base, the connoisseurs of art and those who merely abandon themselves to their natural senses. The tale is also infinitely popular in India, ... there the heroic loyalty and devotion of Damayantī is as famous as that of Penelope among us; and in Europe, the gathering-place of the products of all parts and ages of the world, it deserves to be so too.\"Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who showed great interest in Indian literature, was also interested in Nala and Damayanti and wrote about them in his daily and annual journals in 1821:\"I also studied Nala with admiration and only regretted that our sensibilities, customs and way of thinking had developed so differently from those of that Eastern nation that such an important work would only attract a few among us, perhaps only specialist readers.\"Nala and Damayanti was one of the first works to be discovered by the emerging field of Indology in the early 19th century. In 1819, Franz Bopp published the first edition in London together with a Latin translation under the title Nalus, carmen sanscritum e Mahābhārato, edidit, latine vertit et adnotationibus illustravit Franciscus Bopp. Since then, it has been translated into German and rewritten several times: The first metrical translation into German by Johann Gottfried Ludwig Kosegarten appeared as early as 1820. Further German translations were made by Friedrich Rückert (1828), Ernst Heinrich Meier (1847), Hermann Camillo Kellner (1886) and others.\nNala and Damayanti has been translated into at least ten European languages (German, English, French, Italian, Swedish, Czech, Polish, Russian, Modern Greek and Hungarian). The Italian poet and Orientalist Angelo De Gubernatis created a stage adaptation of the material (Il re Nala, 1869).\nTo this day, Nala and Damayanti is traditionally the preferred beginning reading for students of Sanskrit at Western universities because of its beauty and the simplicity of the language.\n\n\n=== Stochastic elements ===\nIn the second half of the 20th century, historians of mathematics began to look at references to stochastic ideas in ancient India, especially the game of dice, which appears in many stories. The story of Nala and Damayanti is special because it mentions two other stochastic themes in addition to dice games: firstly, the art of rapid counting, a kind of inference from a sample to the whole and a connection between dice games and this inference that is unknown to us today. It tells of two dice games that Nala plays against his brother Pushkara. In the first, he loses his kingdom and has to flee; in the second, he wins it back. In the first dice game, Nala is portrayed as being obsessed with gambling. According to the story, the reason he wins back his lost kingdom in the second dice game is that he was able to successfully apply the knowledge he learned from King Rituparna.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nWadley, Susan S., ed.

        "content": "The Equestrian Portrait of Joachim Murat, King of Naples is an oil on canvas painting by the French neoclassical and pre-romantic painter Antoine-Jean Gros, created c. 1808-1812. It is held at the Louvre, in Paris. \n\n\n== History ==\nMarshal Joachim Murat had several equestrian portraits made of his likeness. Gros knew him well, having met in Milan during the first Italian campaign in 1796. Murat commissioned him the large painting The Battle of Aboukir, which was exhibited at the Salon of French Artists of 1806, before being transferred to the Royal Palace of Naples, where Murat moved in the Summer of 1808, when he was made king of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.\nThe current painting was shown at the Salon in Paris in 1812. Simultaneously with this portrait, Gros was commissioned to paint the Surrender of Capri, but the project remained at the sketch stage after the fall and execution of Murat, in 1815.\n\n\n== Description ==\nMurat is shown in a three-quarters view, riding a harnessed chestnut horse, in a seaside landscape. A tiger skin serves as a saddle cloth. A smoking volcano appears on the right in the distance and a column of smoke on the left.\nThe King of Naples prances in a colorful uniform where the red cord of the Legion of Honor is superimposed on the blue color of the royal order of Naples.\nThis portrait reflects the ambiguous position of Murat as king of Naples, since the Bourbons, who had been expelled from Naples, retained control of half of the kingdom, the island of Sicily, defended by the British fleet. Murat was only the head of state of a satellite kingdom of the French Empire, from which he would try to emancipate himself, while maintaining his loyalty to Napoleon.\nThe tiger skin placed on the purebred Arabian horse raising the dust of a desertic landscape recalls Murat's personal bravery during the Egyptian campaign; the silhouette of the Vesuvius, however, places the painting in the Bay of Naples. The cannonade at the sea on the left in the background certainly represents the attack on Capri, taken back from the British in October 1808. Commissioned from Gros in 1812, the portrait is also a history painting and a vector of political propaganda: it represents Murat as conqueror of his own kingdom, replaying the successful capture of Capri to better mark the failed capture of Sicily in the fall of 1810, due to lack of support from Napoleon.\n\n\n== Provenance ==\nThe portrait was acquired by donation by the Louvre Museum in 1973; it previously belonged to Prince Joachim Murat.\n\n\n== References ==",

The Marathas secured a decisive victory, largely attributed to the swift tactics of Bajirao Peshwa. Concerned by the Marathas' growing power, the Mughal Emperor called upon the Nizam to assist in driving them out, but Bajirao defeated him near Bhopal in December 1737, compelling him to agree to Maratha terms. This led to the signing of the humiliating Treaty of Bhopal on January 7, 1738, wherein the Nizam ceded Malwa to the Marathas and the Mughals agreed to pay 5,000,000 as indemnity.\n\n\n== Terms of the Treaty ==\nMughal Concessions: The Mughal Empire likely conceded defeat and agreed to pay a significant financial sum of 5,000,000 rupees to the Marathas as war indemnity.\nMaratha Gains: The Marathas secured territorial concessions, potentially including the Malwa region, which would become a crucial base for their future expansion in Central India.\nBhopal's Status: The Nawab of Bhopal, Dost Mohammad Khan, who had sided with the Mughals, might have retained his position but became a tributary of the Marathas, acknowledging their suzerainty.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Kell Brook vs. Errol Spence Jr. was a professional boxing match contested on 27 May 2017, for the IBF Welterweight championship.\n\n\n== Background ==\nKell Brook had made three successful defences of his IBF welterweight belt since his August 2014 victory over Shawn Porter and was ranked by Ring Magazine as the best welterweight in the world. In his previous bout in September 2016, he had moved up two weight divisions to challenge the undefeated top ranked Middleweight champion, Gennady Golovkin. Brook would suffer his first career loss, suffering a damaged eye socket before trainer Dominic Ingle threw in the towel during the fifth round. Despite this, Brook won many admirers for his spirited performance and stepping up two weight divisions to make the fight. Ingle confirmed Brook had gone through surgery successfully.\nFollowing this defeat Brook and his team entered into talks with Amir Khan over a potential grudge fight, while also keeping his IBF mandatory Errol Spence Jr. as an alternative. During negotiations, Khan urged Brook to fight Spence first and eventually talks broke down between Brook and Khan. Eddie Hearn mentioned talks were already ongoing with Spence's manager Al Haymon for a fight to take place possibly in the UK in May. Hearn received an extension from the IBF for negotiations between himself and TGB Promotions boss Tom Brown, as they were progressing. The purse bids for the fight were set for 7 February by the IBF. On 1 February, Hearn claimed that Brook would be keeping his title and making a defence against Spence and that he had reached out to Spence's team, to no reply. He assumed that they wanted the fight to go to purse bids. Spence said that he had no problem travelling to the UK for the fight, regardless of negotiations. With a deal close to being reached a day before the purse bids, the IBF granted a week extension, pushing the purse bid back 7 days. On 13 February a deal was reached for the fight to take place in Sheffield on 20 May 2017. At a press conference at Bramall Lane, Sheffield on 22 March, the fight was officially announced to take place on 27 May 2017 live on Sky Box Office in the UK and Showtime in the US.\nThis was the first boxing match to be held at Bramall Lane since Herol Graham vs. Lindell Holmes in July 1984.\n\n\n== The fights ==\n\n\n=== Undercard ===\nUndefeated Super middleweight contender Jamie Cox scored a ninth round technical decision victory over Lewis Taylor and Lenroy Thomas scored a split decision victory over David Allen for the vacant Commonwealth heavyweight title. Allen's father Dave had won on the undercard of the Graham vs Holmes bout in 1984.\n\n\n=== Groves vs Chudinov ===\nIn the chief support George Groves challenged former titleholder Fedor Chudinov for the vacant WBA super middleweight title. This was Groves' 4th attempt at a world title, having been stopped twice against Carl Froch and losing a split decision to Badou Jack.\nAfter an evenly matched first couple of rounds, with Chudinov walking the Briton down and drawing blood above Groves' left eye in the third round. Groves was cut above the eye in round four after an accidental clash of heads. With the bout finely poised entering the sixth round, Groves landed a right hook and followed up with a barrage of unanswered punches leading to referee Steve Gray stepping in to stop the bout.\nSpeaking in the aftermath Groves would credit his trainer Shane McGuigan, \"This is the end of a lifetime's work. Shane McGuigan has resurrected my career. Now I'm mature enough to admit that. I feel like I'm the best in the division. I'm willing and ready to fight anyone.\"\n\n\n=== Main Event ===\nThe 27,000 fans in attendance witnessed an extremely close and competitive contest. After a cagey opening round, Brook was able to land his counter overhand left with greater frequency throughout the first half of the bout and was typically the more aggressive fighter. Spence was able to trouble Brook with a right hook in third round, which forced the champion to stumble back momentarily, and was consistently able to land shots to the body. Spence was sent staggering onto the ropes by a big right hand early in the sixth round but the challenger would quickly regain his composure and would end the round the stronger. By the eighth round Brook's left eye was swelling noticeably and Spence would began to take control, clearly winning the ninth. Early in the tenth, Spence, having Brook against the ropes, unloaded some heavy power shots, which caused Brook to go out. He beat the count, and Spence attempted to finish the fight but Brook would land a pair of left undercuts that helped him make it out of the round. However with his left eye nearly closing, Brook would sink to one knee just over a minute into the 11th round following a left to the body. He rose to his feet but the referee Howard Foster waved it off. At the time of the stoppage Spence led on all three scorecards with Adalaide Byrd having it 97–92, Alejandro Lopez 96–93 and Dave Parris 95–94. ESPN's Dan Rafael had it 95–94 in favour of Spence, as did Sky Sports' Carl Froch and BBC 5 Live's Steve Bunce and FanSided. Trainer Adam Booth had it 96–94 and both the The Guardian and Showtime's Steve Farhood had it 96–93 for Spence.\nSpence landed 246 of 633 punches thrown (39%) while Brook landed 136 of 442 (31%).\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nSpeaking to Sky Sports in the ring after the bout Spence would praise Brook saying \"I give Kell all the credit, and the hardcore fans here. A true champion goes anywhere to fight. He has gone to America and fought so I came here. I didn't feel that sharp tonight but true champions still win. He was tired, fatigued but kept firing shots. The goal is to unify the champion and become undisputed welterweight champion of the world.\"\nA clearly disappointed Brook would similarly praise the new champion saying \"It was a very tough fight and he is one of the best I've been with, if not the best. I got caught in the seventh in the eye and it felt the same as against Golovkin. I couldn't see out of the eye, so I had to stop. I thought it was very competitive, he won a few rounds, I won a few rounds, I felt I was in the fight. I'm gutted, devastated that in front of my own fans I've lost my belt.\"\nBrook's promoter Eddie Hearn, said that Brook should now move up in weight saying \"He took this fight because he didn't want to vacate. He broke his eye socket in the seventh round and kept going. Kell is stubborn, I believe he should move to light-middleweight. Amir Khan is a fight we have wanted for five years, but at the moment it is all about making sure Kell is OK.\"\nThe day after the bout Brook confirmed to Sky Sports that a CT scan showed he had broken his left eye socket, meaning he would likely have surgery.\n\n\n== Undercard ==\nConfirmed bouts:\n\n\n== Broadcasting ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Oumou Sall Seck (born 19 August 1968) is a Malian politician and ambassador.\n\n\n== Early life, education, and career ==\nOumou was born on 19 August 1968 to a Songhai father and a Tuareg mother. Before she became mayor, she worked as a businesswoman selling cosmetic products. She studied Cooperation and Development in Mandé Bukari University and graduated in 2013 and earned a certificate in International Law and Comparative Human Rights Law from International Institute of Human Rights in 2017. In 2002, Oumou supported Amadou Toumani Touré candidacy during the 2002 Malian presidential election.\n\n\n== Mayor of Goundam ==\nOumou ran for the 2004 Goundam mayoral election after her male colleague persuaded her to participate. During the election campaign, she promised to build the town's health center and women's multifunctional spaces and assist FGM victims. In June 2004, she won the election, making her the first woman mayor in northern Mali. On 23 May 2009, she was reelected as the mayor of Goundam for the second term. Shortly before the 2016 mayoral election, Oumou left the URD party for disagreements on several issues, causing the URD to ally with RPM and APR to defeat her. Nevertheless, she won again the Goundam mayoral election as an independent candidate in November 2016 for the third term.\nDuring his tenure as Mayor of Goundam from 2004 to 2018, she built a women's community service, health center, water supply, basketball court, local product transformation, schools, kindergarten, independence square, public lighting, and a bridge. She also constructed the town municipal building that replaced the poor-condition town hall, which was completed in 2017. Alongside this infrastructure improvement work, she also campaigned against Female genital mutilation in Goundam. Due to her work, Goundam became the example for other municipalities in the Tombouctou Region in terms of education, health, economic development, public lighting, women's rights, training, and retraining of FGM victims. She was named the most popular Malian female politician in 2013.\nWhile serving as the mayor of Goundam, she also held various positions such as First Secretary of “Communication of the Association of Municipalities of Mali” (2005–2010), Director of the board of Directors of the National Agency for Territorial Communities Investments” ANICT (2005–2011), 8th vice-president of the “National Executive Committee” (CENA) of the Citizen Movement (2009–2010), 8th Vice President of URD party (2011–2016), and Member of the Office of the Commissioner for Security Sector Reform CSSR (2017–present). Apart from that, she joined PDES and left the party on 28 September 2011. In 2012, she founded the Movement “Trait-d'Union” in response to the 2012 conflict.\nIn 2012, Northern Mali faced a conflict between the government forces and  MNLA and Ansar Dine. Oumou was forced to flee for her life from Goundam to Bamako on 13 April. The next day, Goundam fell to MNLA. During her exile, she wrote an opinion in the New York Times demanding the US and France intervention to assist Mali in capturing the jihadist-controlled territories in northern Mali. She only returned to Goundam in May 2013 after the gendarmes and Burkinabe contingent of AFISMA arrived and stationed at the town.\nIn 2015, Oumou took part in the Algiers Talks. At the same year, she also became the mediator in Ber for the release of ten hostages.\n\n\n== Diplomatic career ==\nOn 26 December 2017, Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta announced that Oumou would be the Ambassador of Mali to Germany, replacing Toumani Djime Djallo. She was officially became the Ambassador of Mali to Germany on 31 May 2018, thus ending her mayoral career. On 19 July 2018, she presented her credentials as an ambassador to Frank-Walter Steinmeier at Bellevue Palace. Other than Germany, she is also accredited to Austria, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Poland, Czech Republic, Sweden, Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia.\nShe stepped down from her position as an ambassador of Mali to Germany in 2023 and Cheick Mahamadou Chérif Keïta replaced her.\n\n\n== Post-Diplomatic career ==\nAssimi Goïta appointed Oumou as the member of the steering committee for Inter-Malian dialogue on 31 January 2024.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOumou speaks English and French.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nOumou received the Peace Prize of the Paul Litzer Foundation for fighting against female circumcisions and Initiative Trophy from Airness Group in 2008.\nThe Embassy of the United States of America in Mali awarded Oumou \"Women In Excellence\" in 2010.\nOumou gained a medal from the Crans Montana Forum Foundation for her commitment to the promotion and protection of women, the strengthening of resilience and well-being of women, peace, and reconciliation in Mali.\nIn 2016, Oumou received Mano Dayak Foundation Prize for her commitment to peace in West Africa, especially in Mali.\nOn 27 October 2017, the Tumast Cultural Center awarded Oumou the Peace Prize.\nOumou was honoured as a knight of the National Order of Mali in late 2018.\nOn 20 November 2018, the Government of Navarre awarded her the XVI International Solidarity Prize.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 1997 Thurrock Council election took place on 1 May 1997 to elect the members of Thurrock Council in Essex, England. It took place on the same day as the 1997 general election and other local elections across England.\n\n\n== Election ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nAt the previous borough council election in May 1996, one third (13) of the council's 39 seats were up for contention. The Labour administration led by Andy Smith gained 4 seats, increasing its total share of seats on the council to 38. Two independent councillors lost their seats, as did the Conservative opposition led by Ray Andrews, leaving them with one seat in the council following the election. \nFrom April to September 1996, the Local Government Commission for England reviewed Thurrock's electoral arrangements. The commission recommended that the borough council continue to be elected in thirds, but also recommended that the number of seats in the council increase from 39 to 49, that the number of wards in the council increase from 15 to 20, and that 10 of the existing wards have their boundaries redrawn. This followed the commission's recommendation in 1994 that Thurrock become a unitary authority. The council's leader Andy Smith supported the recommendations. The government issued statutory instruments implementing the commission's recommendations in July 1996 and February 1997. \nAs per government orders, Essex County Council electoral districts in Thurrock would not be contested in the 1997 Essex County Council election, with county councillors from Thurrock continuing to serve until 1 April 1998, when their seats would be abolished and the Thurrock unitary authority established. An all-out election for the unitary authority was scheduled for May 1997 on the same day as other local elections in England, with all 49 seats up for contention. Incumbent borough councillors would retire after this election unless re-elected to the unitary authority. Unitary authority councillors would serve on the borough council until the unitary authority's legal formation in April 1998.\n\n\n==== Ward changes ====\nThe wards of Belhus, Corringham and Fobbing, Ockendon, Stifford and West Thurrock had their boundaries redrawn, with the number of seats in West Thurrock increasing from 2 to 3 while the number of seats in Corringham and Fobbing fell from 3 to 2. Aveley, Chadwell St. Mary, Orsett, East Tilbury and The Homesteads did not undergo boundary changes, though the number of seats in East Tilbury did increase from 1 to 2. The ward of Tilbury was split into Tilbury St. Chads and Tilbury Riverside, Standford-le-Hope was split into Stanford-le-Hope West and Standford-le-Hope East, and Little Thurrock was split into Little Thurrock Blackshots and Little Thurrock Rectory. Grays Thurrock Town and Grays Thurrock North were abolished and replaced by Grays Thurrock and Grays Riverside. The new ward of Corringham West was split from Corringham and Fobbing, while the new ward of Chafford Hundred was formed from parts of West Thurrock, Stifford, Grays Thurrock North and Grays Thurrock Town.\n\n\n=== Results summary ===\n\nThe election took place on 1 May 1997, on the same day as other local elections across England, as well as the 1997 general election. The Labour Party led by Andy Smith won 46 seats in the new council with an overall vote share of 68.7%, while the Conservative Party led by Ray Andrews won 3 seats with an overall vote share of 29.3%. The Liberal Democrats fielded one candidate, Stephen Martine in the Stanford-le-Hope West ward, and did not win any seats with an overall vote share of 0.4%. Two candidates, John and June Everett in the Chafford Hundred ward, stood as Independent Conservative candidates and secured an overall vote share of 0.8%. There was one independent candidate, Marie Bamford-Burst, who stood in Tilbury Riverside and secured an overall vote share of 0.3%. James Calder in the Grays Riverside ward also stood as an Independent Residents Association candidate, securing 0.5% of the overall vote share in the borough.\nThe Labour administration remained in power following the election. Andy Smith and Ray Andrews remained Leader of the Council and Leader of the Opposition respectively after the council became a unitary authority. This was the first and only election since Thurrock Council became a unitary authority where all seats were contested. From the next council election in 1999, seats were contested in thirds every three in four years. From 2025, the council will revert to an all-out electoral system with all seats up for contention in the 2025 council election and beyond.\n\n\n== Ward results ==\n\n\n=== Aveley ===\n\n\n=== Belhus ===\n\n\n=== Chadwell St. Mary ===\n\n\n=== Chafford Hundred ===\n\n\n=== Corringham & Fobbing ===\n\n\n=== Corringham West ===\n\n\n=== East Tilbury ===\n\n\n=== Grays Riverside ===\n\n\n=== Grays Thurrock ===\n\n\n=== Little Thurrock Blackshots ===\n\n\n=== Little Thurrock Rectory ===\n\n\n=== Ockendon ===\n\n\n=== Orsett ===\n\n\n=== Stanford-le-Hope East ===\n\n\n=== Stanford-le-Hope West ===\n\n\n=== Stifford ===\n\n\n=== The Homesteads ===\n\n\n=== Tilbury Riverside ===\n\n\n=== Tilbury St. Chads ===\n\n\n=== West Thurrock ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Francis Demainbray Crowdy (17 September 1857 - 12 February 1939) was an English medical doctor and footballer who played in the 1880 FA Cup final for Oxford University.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nCrowdy was the son of Alfred, a solicitor from Berkshire.  The family moved to Torquay in the mid-1860s.He was educated at Westminster School, an early adopter of association football laws, and appeared in the school's Christmas play (Andria by the Roman comedian Terence) in 1875.  He had an aptitude for athletics, winning the school's high jump contest in 1874 with a clearance of 5', and second in the pole vault with a height of 8'1\".He went up to Oriel College, Oxford in 1877, reading Mechanics and Physics & Chemistry, and took a \"sportsman's\" third.  He became a doctor of medicine in 1885.\n\n\n== Football career ==\nCrowdy first played football for his school in 1873, and one particular highlight was his scoring one of the school's goals in a 2–2 draw with the Wanderers in 1875.He first played for Oxford University as a forward in the 1877 Varsity Match, which Oxford won 1–0.  His first FA Cup match came in the fourth round second replay match with the Royal Engineers in the 1877–78 competition; he scored one of the university's two goals, taking advantage of the ball spilling out of a scrimmage, but the Sappers won 4–2.He did not feature at all in the 1878–79 FA Cup, but was a regular in the 1879–80 FA Cup; it was his shot, in the semi-final against Nottingham Forest, which was parried into the path of George Childs for Childs to score the only goal of the game.  He \"greatly distinguish[ed]\" himself in the final against Clapham Rovers, but Oxford went down 1–0.After leaving university he continued to play football, usually on the left-wing or in the centre of the forward line, for the Old Westminsters.  His last match of any note was in the 3–2 defeat to the Old Carthusians in the 1882–83 FA Cup third round, in which he had the role of captain.\n\n\n== Medical career ==\nDr Crowdy was a member of the British Medical Association for 37 years; he originally practised at St Thomas' Hospital in London, and spent 30 years in practice in Torquay, never mentioning his association football career to his colleagues, and instead enjoying cricket as a recreation.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHe married Florence Saunders on 8 April 1896 at St Mary's Church in Marylebone.  The couple had two sons and two daughters.  Dr Crowdy died in Exeter on 12 February 1939, survived by his widow and three of his children.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Gulaal Gota (Hindi: गुलाल गोटा, lit. 'color ball') is a small, spherical container made from lac, filled with dry Gulal powder, used for celebrating the Hindu festival of Holi. It is a traditional element of Holi celebrations in Jaipur, Rajasthan, India, with a history dating back around 300 or 400 years.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe use of Gulal Gotas can be traced back to the time of the erstwhile Jaipur royal family. According to legends, Gulal Gotas were a favoured way for the royals to play Holi. These handcrafted balls are made by the Muslim artisan community known as Manihars in Jaipur.\nThe Indian government has provided \"artisan cards\" to artisans of Gulaal Gota, granting them access to various benefits under government schemes. There is demand from Gulaal Gota makers who have asked for a Geographical Indication (GI) tag to safeguard their product and promote its unique regional identity.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe lac, a resin secreted by lac insects, is sourced from regions like Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. The artisans begin by boiling the lac in water to make it pliable. This softened lac is then shaped and coloured, with red, yellow, and green being the base colours used for further combinations. Once shaped and coloured, the lac is heated and blown into a small sphere with the help of a special tool called a Phunkni (blower). The final step involves filling these hollow lac spheres with dry gulal powder before sealing them. The production process is entirely manual and requires skilled artisans.\n\n\n== Holi ==\nDuring Holi celebrations, people throw Gulaal Gotas at each other. Upon impact, the lac shell breaks, releasing the coloured powder and creating an explosion of colour. Compared to throwing loose gulaal powder, Gulaal Gotas offer a more controlled and targeted way to play with colours.\nThere are concerns about the continuity of this tradition as younger generations may not be as interested in pursuing this craft.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGulal\nHoli\nLac (resin)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGulaal Gota for holi in Jaipur, aired on DD News in 2014\nJaipur’s Centuries Old Tradition of ‘Gulaal Gota’ Holi",

        "content": "The Glavchev Government is the 103rd cabinet of Bulgaria. It was appointed by President Rumen Radev on 9 April 2024, and sworn in the same day. The Glavchev Caretaker Cabinet was the first Caretaker Cabinet to be selected using the system created by the Constitutional Amendments of December, 2023, and was the first Caretaker Cabinet to be sworn in in the presence of the National Assembly, rather than in the presence of the President.\n\n\n== Cabinet ==\n\n\n== Tenure ==\n\n\n=== Transition of power & initial Civil Service changes ===\nThe Glavchev Caretaker Government was officially sworn in on the 9th of April, in the presence of the National Assembly. \nIn the days following its investiture, Caretaker Ministers made a number of changes within the civil service. Caretaker Finance Minister, Lyudmila Petkova, removed the incumbent head of the Customs Agency, Petya Bankova, who was detained in relation to alleged participation in an organised criminal group, and replaced her with Georgi Dimov. Kalin Stoyanov, Caretaker Minister of Interior, requested the removal of Secretary to the Ministry, Zhivko Kotsev.\n\n\n=== Cabinet reshuffle ===\nOnly a week after the appointment of the cabinet, Prime Minister Glavchev requested the removal of two Ministers: the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Stefan Dimitrov, and the Minister of Foods and Agriculture, Kiril Vutev, both of whom he accused of not properly fulfilling their roles. In their place, he proposed GERB MP, Daniel Mitov, for Minister of Foreign Affairs, and head of the State Fund \"Agriculture\", Georgi Tahov, for Minister of Agriculture.\nThe cabinet reshuffle led to BSP and Revival submitting a dubious in terms of its constitutionality Vote of No Confidence against the Glavchev government.\nOn the 19th of April, Mitov officially confirmed that he refused the position of Caretaker Minister of Foreign Affairs.\nOn the 20th of April, Glavchev announced that he had proposed himself for the position of Caretaker Minister of Foreign Affairs.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "IC 1623 is a galaxy merger in the constellation Cetus. The galaxy lies about 250 million light years away from Earth, which means, given its apparent dimensions, that IC 1623 is approximately 115,000 light years across. It was discovered by Lewis Swift on November 19, 1897.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nIC 1623 consists of two galaxies in the early to mid stages of merger. The nuclei of the two galaxies lie 20 arcseconds apart.  The western component (VV 114W) is bright in ultraviolet and optical light and hosts a large number of optically luminous young star clusters. The eastern component, VV 114E, is invisible at UV wavelengths and has prominent dust lanes that cover much of the diffuse light of the underlying stellar population at optical wavelengths. Beyond 1 μm, VV 114E increasingly becomes the dominant luminosity component of the merger, being the brightest source in mid infrared. The whole galaxy shines bright in infrared and it is characterised as a luminous infrared galaxy, with a total infrared luminosity (LIR) of 5 × 1011 L⊙.\nThe nucleus of the eastern galaxy was observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in mid infrared and it was found that it consists of a northeastern and a southwestern core. According to Evans et al, the mid-IR colors of these cores are consistent with a starburst (NE) and an AGN (SW). Rich et al reached similar conclusions. The spectral lines indicate that there is possibly an intermediate-mass black hole at the southwest nucleus that accretes rapidly material on its way to become a supermassive black hole. JWST also spotted 40 star-formation regions, with a total star formation rate between 0.02 and 6 M☉/year. There is also significant diffuse emission from filaments, mainly attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons heated by the star-forming regions and underlying stellar population.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nIC 1623 on WikiSky: DSS2, SDSS, GALEX, IRAS, Hydrogen α, X-Ray, Astrophoto, Sky Map, Articles and images",

        "content": "Michael Thomas Martin, OFM. Conv. (born 2 December 1961) is an American Catholic prelate who was appointed Bishop of Charlotte in April 2024. A priest of the Order of Friars Minor Conventual, he previously worked as a high school teacher and administrator, a parish priest and pastor, and a college chaplain.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nMartin was born on December 2, 1961, in Baltimore, Maryland, to Beverly Beatty and Donald Martin, and attended high school at Archbishop Curley High School. He entered novitiate for the Conventual Franciscans at Ellicott City, Maryland, in August 1979 and professed his solemn vows on August 2, 1985. In the meantime he earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy from Saint Hyacinth Seminary in Granby, Massachusetts, a Baccalaureate in Sacred Theology from the Pontifical University of St. Bonaventure in Rome, and a master's degree in education from Boston College. He was ordained to the priesthood on June 10, 1989, by Bishop John Huston Ricard at St. Casimir Church, Baltimore.\n\n\n=== Priesthood ===\nAfter ordination, Martin worked as a teacher and coach at Saint Francis High School in Athol Springs, New York, from 1989 to 1994, and then served in similar roles and eventually as principal and president at Archbishop Curley High School from 1994 to 2010, leading a $7 million capital campaign and increasing its enrollment after a decline throughout the 1990s. Because of his work at this school he received the Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice award in 2007.From 2010 to 2022, he served as the director of the Duke University Catholic Center, which serves the approximately 2500 Catholic students studying at the institution.From 2022 to April 2024, he was pastor of St. Philip Benizi Church in Jonesboro, Georgia.\n\n\n=== Episcopacy ===\nOn April 9, 2024, Pope Francis accepted the resignation of Bishop Peter Jugis of Charlotte due to \"chronic but non-life-threatening\" kidney issues, and appointed Martin as his successor.With this appointment, the Conventual Franciscans became the most represented religious community among the active bishops of the United States, the others being John Stowe of the Diocese of Lexington and Gregory Hartmayer of the Archdiocese of Atlanta.Martin's episcopal consecration is scheduled for May 29 at St. Mark Catholic Church in Huntersville, North Carolina.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of Atlanta Official Site",

        "content": "Arsen Kvezerov is an Ossetian politician from the partially recognized Caucasian Republic of South Ossetia, which most of the United Nations recognizes as part of Georgia, occupied by Russia.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nIn 2019 Kvezerov served on a committee denouncing the 1918-1920 Georgian–Ossetian conflict as a genocide of the Ossetian people.\nIn the fall of 2023 South Ossetia saw a massive increase in price for gasoline and other petroleum products. Alan Tekhov claimed that the 261.8% increase in import export rates was not impacting the price of petroleum products, and that the cause of the increase was due to the government enforcing the 20% value-added tax at the South Ossetian-Russian border. Kvezerov retorted that the price of gas was quickly escaping rates that the average South Ossetian can afford, and that this price hike, if not mitigated, could result in a crisis.\nKvezerov is a vocal supporter of South Ossetia agriculture, frequently supporting efforts to support farmers and increase domestic foodstuff production. In February 2024 Kvezerov dissented to a subsidy package for small and medium-sized business, stating that the money would be better allocated for farmers. Kvezerov also advocates for reducing customs and duties imposed on people traveling from Russia to South Ossetia.\nKvezerov was named chairman of the parliamentary the accounting commission. Due to this Kvezerov is frequently involved in committees and negotiations revolving around the state budget and allocation of state resources. In 2023, as Deputy Chairman of the Committee on Economics, Small Business, and Agriculture, Kvezerov went on a state visit to Abkhazia during their Victory Day Parades exchanging gifts with Abkhazian lawmakers. Kvezerov also served on the committee on foreign policy and inter-parliamentary relations, approving a motion to increase coopreation with the Syrian People's Assembly.\nIn 2022 Kvezerov, alongside Robert Ostaev and Harry Muldarov, personally delivered aid to Ossetian fighters on the side of Russia during their invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sir Richard Newdigate, 3rd Baronet (29 April 1668 – 22 July 1727) was an English landowner.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nNewdigate was born on 29 April 1668. He was the eldest of two sons and seven daughters born to Sir Richard Newdigate, 2nd Baronet and Mary Bagot. His father, a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber, served as MP for Warwickshire.\nHis paternal grandparents were Sir Richard Newdigate, 1st Baronet and Juliana Leigh (daughter of Sir Francis Leigh of King's Newnham). His maternal grandparents were Sir Edward Bagot, 2nd Baronet of Blithefield and Mary (née Lambard) Crawley (widow of John Crawley of Someries, Bedfordshire and daughter of William Lambard of Buckingham).\nHe was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, matriculating in November 1685.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nUpon the death of his father on 4 January 1710, with whom he was said to have a terrible relationship (his father described him in his will as \"my most inveterate and implacable enemy\"), he succeeded as the 3rd Baronet Newdigate, of Arbury. He inherited the estates of Arbury and of Harefield in Middlesex together all of his father's considerable debts. Coal was found on the Arbury estate in the early 1700s and he introduced Newcomen atmospheric engines in 1716. His son, the 5th Baronet, later expanded the production greatly.\nIn 1712 he was appointed a trustee of Rugby School.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOn 17 June 1704 Newdigate was married to Elizabeth Twisden (1681–1765) at East Malling, Kent. Elizabeth was a daughter of Sir Roger Twisden, 2nd Baronet, MP for Rochester, and Margaret Marsham (a daughter of Sir John Marsham). Together, they were the parents of at least eleven children, including:\n\nElizabeth Newdigate (1703–1769), who married Hon. John Chichester, second son of Arthur Chichester, 3rd Earl of Donegall and Lady Catherine Forbes (a daughter of the 1st Earl of Granard), in 1726.\nRichard Newdigate (1705–1706), who died young.\nJohn Newdigate (1707–1709), who died young.\nMary Newdigate (1709–1744), who married Charles Palmer of Ladbroke Hall in 1733.\nJuliana Newdigate (1711–1780), who married John Bracebridge Ludford of Ansley Hall, in 1733.\nSir Edward Newdigate, 4th Baronet (1716–1732), who was educated at Westminster School and University College, Oxford before his unexpected death.\nSir Roger Newdigate, 5th Baronet (1719–1806), who married Sophia Conyers, daughter of Edward Conyers, in 1743. After her death, he married Hesther Margaret Munday, a daughter Edward Mundy of Shipley Hall and sister to Edward Miller Mundy, in 1776.\nSir Richard died at Arbury on 22 July 1727 and was buried at St Mary the Virgin Church, Harefield, of which his family was patron. He was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, Edward.  As Edward died without issue in 1732, the baronetcy passed to Richard's second son, Roger, who also died without issue in 1806 at which time the baronetcy became extinct. Arbury Hall and Harefield passed to Francis Parker of Kirk Hallam, Derbyshire, a distant cousin of the 5th Baronet, who then adopted the additional name of Newdigate. Francis moved into Arbury Hall and married Lady Barbara Maria Legge (a daughter of the 3rd Earl of Dartmouth), in 1820.\n\n\n=== Descendants ===\nThrough his daughter Juliana, he was a grandfather of John Newdigate Ludford, who married Elizabeth Boswell (parents of Elizabeth Juliana Bracebridge Ludford, wife of Sir John Newdigate-Ludford-Chetwode, 5th Baronet).\nThrough his daughter Elizabeth, he was a grandfather of Arthur Chichester, 5th Earl of Donegall (created 1st Marquess of Donegall in the Peerage of Ireland in 1791), who married Lady Anne Hamilton (a daughter of the 5th Duke of Hamilton).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ryan Andrew Stawaisz (18 August 1989 – 21 June 2021) was an American Roman Catholic priest in the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nStawaisz was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, on 18 August 1989 to Ray and Susan Stawaisz. He had only one brother, Ross. Despite not being of Scottish descent, he developed a love for the Scottish countryside and traditions, especially the bagpipes. He loved serving at Church, enjoying sports, going hunting, spending time with his family, and was an Eagle Scout.\nHe attended Texas A&M University and studied Petroleum Engineering as a member of the Fightin' Texas Aggie Class of 2011. During his studies, Stawaisz was diagnosed with cancer and spent months fighting the disease after which he eventually recovered. After joining a Catholic retreat (Aggie Awakening Retreat), he began discerning the vocation to priesthood.\nAfter graduating from college, Stawaisz declined employment opportunities in order to fully discern his priestly vocation. He entered Saint Joseph Seminary College in Covington, Louisiana, where he earned a degree in philosophy. He pursued his studies further at Saint Mary's Seminary in Houston, Texas, and shortly before his ordination, he received another cancer diagnosis. Despite his diagnosis, he was ordained to the diaconate and eventually to the priesthood on 1 June 2019.\nHe began his priestly ministry at Prince of Peace Catholic Church as a parochial vicar.  While undergoing medical treats, which, at times, causes him to be confined in hospital facilities, he continued performing his ministries, being passionate about increasing vocational awareness in the diocese and celebrating the sacraments.\nStawaisz died on 21 June 2021, with the reputation for holiness. He was regarded as \"a young priest who touched the hearts of many and embraced God’s will after receiving a life-altering diagnosis.\"\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nA film entitled Love God's Will: The True Story of Fr. Ryan Stawaisz was produced by Palomita Films in memory of Stawaisz. It explores his life witnessed by a number of other people who knew him personally and the possibility of introducing his cause for beatification.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFr.

The magazine is headquartered in Budapest, Hungary.\n\n\n== History and profile ==\nLakáskultúra was established by the Hungarian Architects’ Association in Budapest in 1964. The Association was also one of the sponsors of the magazine. Its publication became regular from 1967. The magazine was part of the Ministry of Domestic Trade between 1964 and 1987. Then it was owned by Pallas until 1989 when Axel Springer Budapest KFT acquired it. The magazine appears monthly.\nDuring the Communist era Lakáskultúra contributed to the state ideology of socialist consumer. It was one of the most read and significant publications in this period. Its popularity was partly because of its content on distinct interior furnishings, room arrangements, decorative inclinations and homes of Hungarian families. Therefore, it hardly ever featured accessories exhibited in trade shows and fairs and professionally designed interiors. The magazine has also published apartment layouts and floor plans.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Amendingen (Swabian: Aumadenga) is a district and parish village of the independent city of Memmingen in Bavaria. The first settlement dates back to before 233. The village was first documented in 1180 and belonged to the rule of the Knights of Eisenburg until 1455. From 1475, the village was divided among various ruling dynasties and monasteries. In 1803 the present parish was established with the Imperial Delegation.\nAmendingen was an independent municipality from 1805 until it was incorporated into Memmingen in 1972. With a population of over 3700, Amendingen is the largest district after Memmingen. The former parish village is best known for its baroque St. Ulrich's Church and the northern industrial park, which is largely located on Amendingen's land.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nThe district of Amendingen in Memmingen is located on the western edge of the Memminger Ach. The village is located north of Memmingen's city center and has grown together with it. Most of the northern industrial area is located in the north of Amendingen.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAmendingen's average annual temperature and precipitation are about average for the temperate climate, with precipitation usually slightly higher and minimum temperatures slightly lower. The Memminger Ach, which flows through the village, and the nearby Weidenbach stream can cause dense fog on the fields and in the village in spring and fall. The coldest month is January with an average daily minimum temperature of -5 °C and an average daily maximum temperature of 2 °C. The warmest months are July and August with an average minimum temperature of 12 °C and an average maximum temperature of 24 °C.\n\n\n=== Geology ===\n\nThe subsoil consists of a layer of loess about one meter thick, under which lies about 20 meters of crushed stone. The valley floor to the east of the community consists of alpine soil and underlying peat deposits, occasionally mixed with gravel and gray-black sand. In particular, the regulated course of the Memminger Ach marks the approximate boundary between alpine soil and gravel. At the edge of the valley, there is a tertiary deposit that favors the abundant occurrence of springs down to Heimertingen.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history (until the 8th century AD) ===\nDuring the Roman Empire, the road from Kempten (Allgäu) (Cambodunum) to Kellmünz (Caelius Mons) probably ran through the Amendingen district. Remains of Roman walls were repeatedly discovered in the town area during several new buildings and renovations. In 1943 and 1954, remains from the 2nd and 3rd century AD were discovered. In the south of the present commune, a retired veteran probably built a manor house, a so-called villa rustica. Archaeological excavations around 1830 and in the early 1960s revealed that the courtyard covered an area of about ninety by ninety meters. It was destroyed by fire and rebuilt at least three times. Craftsmen's houses were probably also connected to the courtyard, as suggested by the discovery of a weaving weight. When the Germanic tribes first overran the Limes north of the Danube in 233, the Roman estate was probably destroyed for the first time.\nThe core of the village of Amendingen, southwest of the church, was probably founded in the course of the Alemannic occupation in the 5th/6th century. An Alemannic settlement route from Heimertingen to Memmingerberg, which followed the course of the Ach, may have been decisive. The old Roman road certainly also played a role in the settlement. As in Memmingen, the place name is composed of a personal name and the suffix -ing. The leader of the tribe was probably called Otmund. Later it became Otmundingen, today Amendingen. The land of the oldest village originally included parts of the Memminger Ach and the fields reclaimed from the Roman estate. During excavations by the Antiquities Society of Memmingen around 1830, a stone slab grave was found, which is now located on the south side of the Memmingen forest cemetery. Due to the lack of grave goods, it is assumed that the grave was built before the year 751, during the Merovingian period. A wall made of tuff, the same material as the burial box, was also excavated. Brick finds showed that the wall and the other finds, except the tombs, date from the Roman period. Further excavations revealed that the pagan inhabitants of Amendingen had built their graves near the destroyed Roman courtyard. The dead lay with their heads facing east. The first church in Amendingen was built around the year 800, probably as a simple wooden structure. The dead were buried in the adjacent cemetery.\n\n\n=== Ottobeuren Abbey and property of secular lords ===\n\nThe Chronicon ottenburanum, a collection of copies of older documents from around 1180, mentions the village of Amendingen with all its possessions (and the people belonging to it) - villam Oumintingen cum pertinentiis suis - as an endowment in the deed of foundation of Ottobeuren Abbey. The copy reproduces the content of a document from 764, which is considered authentic but has been lost. A document from 972 attests to a cession of territory by Ottobeuren Abbey, although its authenticity is disputed. The early 12th century copy mentions Amendingen as oppidum Oumintingen cum vico suo Trunkenesperc. In it, Emperor Otto I enfeoffed the Alemannic Duke Burchard III of Swabia with lands that the Ottobeuren monastery had ceded to the emperor in order to free him from the duties of military service, military duty and court storage. The earliest surviving written mention of Amendingen is in the Vita of St. Ulrich, written by the Augsburg cathedral provost Gerhard in 982/992, who, on his return journey from Upper Swabian Obersulmetingen to Augsburg in May 973, met with monks from the nearby monastery in Amendingen to inform them of the imperial privilege of a free abbacy.\n\nAround 1200, Amendingen passed into the hands of the Knights of Eisenburg, who had taken over the military duties in the area from the Dukes of Swabia and thus became the economic center of this dominion. Ecclesiastically, the village belonged to the Rot an der Rot Abbey since 1341. The last knight of Eisenburg sold his dominion.\n\n\n=== Ownership of Memmingen and the Protestant-Catholic conflict ===\nIn 1455, Amendingen came into the possession of the patrician family Sättelin from Memmingen, and later a large part of the village came into the possession of other Memmingen burghers, who are commemorated by street names (Marquard, Spichel, Waimer, Zehender). In 1580, the village, along with other places, became the property of the neighboring imperial city of Memmingen. From 1586 the city also had high jurisdiction over the village. Twenty-one years later, in 1601, the Ulm citizen and patrician Hans Eitel Neubronner acquired the entire Eisenburg estate. The Sättelins, as citizens of Memmingen, had become Protestant during the Reformation, and the Neubronners, as their successors, had also accepted the new doctrine as citizens of Ulm. Although the lordship was now Protestant, the advocate above the lordship was Catholic. This led to differences that resulted in a treaty in 1586, thirty years after the Peace of Augsburg. Church records show that one hundred and fifty of the six hundred subjects remained Catholic. The treaty stipulated that the lords of Eisenburg could remain Protestant, but the subjects were to remain in the old Catholic religion. If they had adopted the new denomination, they were allowed to keep it for a further eight years. After that, the subjects had to return to the old religion under threat of punishment. The pastor at the time, Gallus Möslin, managed to convert most of them before the deadline expired. However, those who wanted to remain in the new faith moved to the Protestant town of Steinheim or Memmingen.\nDuring the Reformation, the first Jews also settled in Amendingen and other places in the Eisenburg dominion, as the imperial cities did not provide them with housing. Since many of the Jews were involved in trade, there were soon minor disputes and several lawsuits between the city of Memmingen and Sebastian von Berwang as the owner of the Eisenburg dominion. In 1573, 83 craftsmen from Memmingen were listed in the debt register of the Jews of Amendingen. From 1600 there was no more Jewish population in Amendingen, as most of them moved to Fellheim, where they were under the protection of the local lord. When the Neubronner family bought the lordship of Amendingen in 1601, it was agreed in the purchase contract that no more Jews would be accepted. As the new owners of the manor, the Neubronner family sought to establish order through contracts and agreements. They defined the rights and duties of the sacristan and the teacher and made an agreement with the Rot an der Rot Abbey about the tithes in Amendingen.\nDuring the Thirty Years' War, imperial and Swedish troops were quartered here, and the population suffered as a result. The former St. Ottilien Chapel was the site of a clash between the two warring parties. The parish registers show that the dead were buried in front of the chapel.\nThe plague also raged in the Memmingen area in 1635. However, it is not known to what extent Amendingen was affected. The most important consequence of the war was that on July 16, 1642, the Abbey of Rot sold the patronage right with the tithe and other properties in Amendingen to the Buxheim Charterhouse. The church in Amendingen was destroyed in 1655 when the tower collapsed. This event led to the construction of a temporary building, which was consecrated in 1661. In 1671 the property was divided into twelve parts by the heirs of the Neubronner family. Although an administrator was appointed for all twelve parts, disputes soon arose. In 1705 the majority was sold to the Memmingen Unterhospital.\nConstruction of the present church began in 1752, with the chancel facing north instead of east. The building was completed in 1754 and consecrated on October 12, 1755.\n\n\n=== 19th century until the Second World War ===\n\nThe village remained under the rule of Eisenburg until 1805. After the Treaty of Lunéville gave the Electorate of Bavaria sovereignty over the Swabian territories, the Crown of Bavaria officially assumed sovereignty in Amendingen on December 31, 1805, at two o'clock in the afternoon. It became an independent Bavarian community. Since then, Amendingen has also included the land towards Eisenburg and Grünenfurt Castle.\nIn 1866, a catastrophe occurred in Amendingen. It went down in history as The Great Fire of Amendingen. The Memmingen weekly newspaper of October 3, 1866 (No. 79) reported the following:\n\n\"On Sunday, September 23, when the people were in church, and on Tuesday, September 25, when the farmers were working in the fields, a large fire broke out in Amendingen, killing 15 people. The fire is said to have started in the butcher's shop (house no. 17) by children setting fire to it, and to have flared up again on Tuesday despite of the fire watch. Eleven families, including many children, were left homeless.\"\nSince the houses at that time were built almost entirely of wood and had thatched roofs, the fire was able to spread quickly. The size of the fire can be seen from the fact that 20 fire brigades fought it. As a result of the fire, the entire townscape changed. Reconstruction was also carried out to prevent such a disaster in the future. Some farms were moved or relocated to loosen up the buildings. The fact that the relocation required notarized contracts is the only reason we know today that seven farms and houses burned down. There is no information about other houses that burned down.\nJohann Dirr took over the office of mayor from his father in 1904. He managed the affairs of Amendingen for more than 40 years, including during the First and Second World Wars.\nAt the beginning of World War I, Amendingen had about 700 inhabitants. After the war, many workers, civil servants and craftsmen settled in the area due to its proximity to Memmingen. Favored by this influx, two main political currents gradually formed in the village. The larger group was the Christian middle class of the Bavarian People's Party and the Center. This was joined by the socialist left of the working class (Social Democrats and Communists). The Bavarian Peasants' League, as a loose right-wing interest group, was also strongly represented. Because of the conflicting political opinions, there were often disputes within the village. The existence of two sports clubs, the Catholic Journeymen's Club and the Workers' Sports Club, both of which practiced the same sports without competing against each other once every ten years, was indicative of this. Around 1930 there were several big fires in the village, caused by an arsonist who was never identified. In 1923 the new school building, now the kindergarten, was inaugurated.\nBy 1933, the Nazis under Hitler were gaining more and more supporters for their NSDAP in Amendingen. However, with about 20% of the votes, the interest remained relatively low. The reason for this was the Catholic attitude of the majority of the inhabitants and the left-wing workers' parties. It was not until Hitler came to power that a local NSDAP group was formed. At the same time, the old city council and Mayor Dirr were to be dismissed and replaced by party members or supporters. The local NSDAP chairman Göppel was to take over the office of mayor on behalf of the district leadership. Due to Dirr's 30 years of service as mayor and the trust the citizens of Amendingen had in him, Göppel realized that Dirr was the more suitable candidate and therefore asked him to remain in office. However, Dirr had to join the party. Göppel himself became deputy mayor. The local group took on the task of organizing festivities such as May Day, Thanksgiving, and others, as well as promoting sports and Nazi institutions. By the beginning of the war, the number of party members had risen from 10 to 80.\n\n\n=== Amendingen during the Second World War ===\n\nSoldiers from Amendingen were already involved in the invasion of Poland. This was the first casualty of the war. During the Balkan campaign in April 1941, many soldiers from Amendingen were deployed with the mountain troops. Soldiers from Amendingen also fought in the cauldron of Stalingrad.\nFrom the beginning of 1943, Amendingen was threatened by Allied air raids because of the nearby Memmingerberg airbase. In the same year, about 50 refugees, mostly women and children, arrived from the almost destroyed city of Essen. They were soon joined by about ten Silesian families.\nBy March 1945, there were about 4,000 wounded soldiers in the military hospitals of Memmingen. The mayor of Memmingen tried to persuade the local doctor to declare Memmingen a military hospital town, i.e. an open town, given the large number of wounded, and thus to surrender without a fight. This would have meant that Amendingen would not have been defended either. The doctor, however, refused, saying that he was too much of a soldier and had a duty to defend even the last pile of sand.\nThe flow of refugees from the West via Egelsee and Ulm continued to increase. In mid-April, the German army began to retreat from the west. The column moved past Amendingen through the town of Memmingen. The Vlasov armymade up of Soviet prisoners of war and \"willing helpers\" recruited by Heinrich Himmler and stationed at the Heuberg camp on the Swabian Alps, passed through Amendingen on its retreat. Most of the estimated 10,000 men went to the nearby municipal forest to bivouac. A few hundred stayed in the village and spent the night. They broke into various houses and looted them. They soon moved east.\nDuring heavy air raids on the Memmingerberg airbase and railroad facilities in Memmingen on April 20, 1945, about 30 bombs fell on the Amendingen area. Except for the railroad tracks near today's sports field, there was no significant damage.\nOn April 26, 1945, around six o'clock in the morning, the first artillery fire was heard. Heimertingen, seven kilometers away, had already been captured and badly damaged. After the American troops had issued an ultimatum for the surrender of Memmingen on the same day, it was decided to surrender the town and the surrounding villages without a fight - also because of the many wounded in the military hospitals. On the orders of the local NSDAP group leader, the local peasant leader went to the city hall in Memmingen later that day to present a declaration of solidarity for the community of Amendingen and the city of Memmingen to surrender without a fight.\nIn the early afternoon, Mayor Dirr and local group leader Göppel surrendered the village without a fight. Dirr also declared that Amendingen was free of German soldiers and that there would be no shooting. A group of French POWs soon became the spokesmen for the people of Amendingen. Most of them had worked for the farmers in the village for two years or more, and they told the Americans that they had been treated well by the farmers and the rest of the population.\nDuring the capture of the city, there was an incident in the old mill in the so-called New World. There was one fatality when the owner of the mayor's office, located in the Villa Stetter, was unable to open the locked door in time and was hit by shots fired by an American soldier to blow up the castle. Otherwise, the American invasion went off without a hitch. The tanks moved on to occupy the town of Memmingen. The last of the 100 Amendingen prisoners of war did not return until five years later. Of the 350 men called to arms, 64 were killed and 35 were missing.\n\n\n=== Postwar period to the present day ===\n\nThe Americans remained in the village for about 14 days until the German surrender. A small staff was left in the village to maintain peace and order and to enforce the interests of the American military government. The large number of forced laborers, who were free to move about, looted the countryside for several days. The Americans had allowed them to do so, so no one could resist. There were reports of mass thefts and fires in all the surrounding villages. But thanks to the testimony of French prisoners of war, nothing happened in Amendingen, with a few exceptions.\nAfter 41 years of uninterrupted service, Mayor Johann Dirr was removed from office by the Americans because of his party affiliation. Six months later he died of a stroke. Josef Höfelmayer, a mill and sawmill owner, was appointed by the occupying forces as his temporary successor. In February 1946, the first free municipal elections were held and Josef Riedmiller, a farmer, was elected mayor of Amendingen.\n\n290 refugees and displaced persons came to Amendingen from the former German territories in the East, especially from the area of Jägerndorf (Krnov) in the Sudetenland. This was a great burden for the community of 900 inhabitants.\n\nIn 1949 and 1950, the last prisoners of war from Russia and other eastern countries returned home. The housing shortage was still great. In the following years, several social housing projects were built, such as a six-family house on the outskirts of the village in 1950 and ten single-family houses on Stoll-Wespach-Strasse in 1952. During the land consolidation in the winter of 1953/54, the regulation of the Memminger Ach was begun. The previously artificial riverbed was filled in and the Ach was returned to its almost natural course. The community, together with the district, had to invest a lot of money to attract new industries and create jobs. In the end, the Metzeler foam rubber factory and the Cord Ltd. carpet factory settled here and built a large factory.\nThe company preferred to hire workers from Amendingen, which helped reduce the high unemployment rate. The temporary municipal offices in the school had become too small. The council bought a farm. A community center was built on the farmer's land at today's Ulrichsplatz. The new building also housed the post office and the volunteer fire department. In 1956, Mayor Riedmiller did not run in the local elections due to health reasons. Henning von Rom was elected as his successor.\nAmendingen's favorable geographic location was a major attraction. Construction activity for industry and commerce, as well as private housing, increased rapidly, resulting in a rapid rise in tax revenues. Social housing was built for refugee families, alleviating the severe housing shortage.\nThe entire road network was constructed in four phases between 1959 and 1963. In addition to the basic widening of the streets, the installation of curbs and the provision of drainage, the streets were given a new asphalt surface. In October 1964, construction began on a new school, which opened on July 16, 1966. The old school became a kindergarten.\nOn July 1, 1972, Amendingen was incorporated into the city of Memmingen as part of the regional reform. This ended the short period of independence of the town. Today the town hall is used by the city of Memmingen and the volunteer fire brigade of Amendingen. In the 1970s, the B18 was extended to the A96 at the southern edge of the village. This road still runs through the middle of the village and separates the old town from the new settlements, such as the Römerhof settlement, named after the remains of a villa rustica found there.\nOver the years, differences arose between the people of Amendingen and Memmingen, mainly due to the delayed construction of a new mortuary at the cemetery and the drastically deteriorating situation at the Amendingen elementary school. More and more students were being taught in cramped conditions. It was not until 1986, after much discussion, that the expansion of the Amendingen school was undertaken. From June 21 to 23, 1985, the new sports field and the sports house of SV Amendingen were inaugurated. In the same year, on September 27, the music room, which had been added to the kindergarten, was inaugurated.\nThe Amendingen Fountain Festival has been held annually since the inauguration of the fountain in front of the former town hall on June 2, 1991. The northern industrial area, most of which is located in Amendingen, has continued to develop. Today it is the second largest contiguous industrial area in Swabia.\nDue to the lack of space, the risk of accidents and the lack of various functional rooms, an initial cost estimate was commissioned in 1993 for the extension of the old fire station to include a training room and wet rooms. After the space situation proved to be insufficient, a completely new fire station was planned. However, several years passed before the groundbreaking ceremony in March 2017, and a site on Donaustrasse near the northern industrial area was chosen as the new location. The new fire station cost just under 4 million euros. With a floor space of 1,100 square meters, the vehicle hall offers space for up to six fire engines, as well as workshop and storage areas and an administrative area with several training and function rooms. The new fire station will be officially opened on April 13, 2019.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\n\n\n=== Religions ===\nDue to its historical development, the parish is predominantly Catholic. The baroque church of St. Ulrich forms the center. Later, an influx of new residents led to the formation of a Protestant parish, which has been housed in the Amendingen Schlössle since 1998. Another church belongs to the Priestly Society of St. Pius X.\n\n\n=== Population development ===\n\n* Estimate\n\n\n== Politics ==\nThe former municipal council consisted of eight councilors, the mayor, and his deputy. The last mayor was the merchant and owner of Grünenfurt Castle, Henning von Rom. After the local elections in March 2008, there were six councilors and the deputy mayor from Amendingen in the Memmingen city council.\nThe former community leaders and mayors were:\n\n    ? - 1904: Dirr Sr.\n1904-1946: Johann Dirr\n1946-1946: Josef Höfelmayr ( provisional)\n1946-1956: Josef Riedmiller\n1956-1972: Henning von Rom\nOn December 9, 1972, shortly after the incorporation, a citizens' committee was founded on the initiative of the Amendingen citizens Xaver Mang, Heinrich Lacher and Stefan Binzer. The task of the citizens' committee was to monitor the adherence to the written and oral concessions made by the city during the involuntary incorporation into Memmingen in a spirit of objective cooperation. The Citizens' Committee has no rights and can only achieve success through skillful action. It must never give the impression that it wants to build a wall between the city and the district of Amendingen. The committee should support the town councilors responsible for Amendingen to the best of their ability and also work directly with the town. Committee members are elected every three years. All residents of Amendingen over the age of 18 are eligible to vote.\n\n\n== Culture and attractions ==\n\n\n=== Historic buildings ===\n\n\n==== Amendingen Schlössle ====\nThe Amendingen Schlössle was built around 1730. It was originally a coppersmith and wire drawing shop. A second stream bed was dug for the operation of the forge hammer, which was filled in again in 1960. Later, the Schlössle temporarily housed the post office.\n\nBecause it was a listed building, it could not be demolished. As a result, it fell into the hands of several people who let it fall into disrepair due to the high cost of renovation. In 1995, the Protestant Church took over the building and renovated it. In 1998 it was inaugurated as the Protestant Parish Hall.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Church of St. Ulrich ====\n\nThe Roman Catholic parish church of St. Ulrich was built between 1752 and 1755 in the Baroque and Rococo styles. The patron saint's day is celebrated on the 4th of July (Ulrich of Augsburg). The most important works of art in the church are a Madonna by Ivo Strigel and a statue of St. Ottilie (around 1500).\n\n\n==== War memorial ====\nThe war memorial with St. George on horseback on a large pedestal, a work of the sculptor Daumiller from Memmingen, was erected in 1923 by the Veterans' Association on the St. Ulrich square. Most of the costs were covered by the municipality, the rest by donations within the association.\n\n\n==== Hammer mill ====\n\nThe first hammer mill's forge with hammer, bollier and grinder stood at Haienbach bey der segmül. It was first mentioned in 1465 when it was awarded to a Blattner (hammersmith). It was probably moved to the northern end of the village soon afterward. For a very long time, it was owned by Memmingen's Unterhospital as a copper hammer, just like the Schlössle. In the 1930s, the hammers and the waterworks were removed after mainly only bell swings had been forged there. The forge was used until the 1950s. Despite its worthy character, it was demolished in 1975 to make way for residential development. The street name At the hammer mill still commemorates the location.\n\n\n==== Tavern ====\n\nThe tavern, now the Gastwirtschaft zum Adler, a simple saddle-roofed house with a wrought-iron cantilever with stylized vines and flowers from the second half of the 18th century, was both an inn and a manor brewery, which had to supply the lordship of Eisenburg and the surrounding villages with beer. The inn was first mentioned in 1475 when the Sättelin family divided the estate. The first innkeeper was mentioned in 1551. The building belongs to the Memmingen brewery and is still an inn.\n\n\n==== Associations ====\nThe oldest organization in the village is the Amendingen Volunteer Fire Department. It is the second largest fire department in the Memmingen area. After the big fire in Amendingen in 1866, there were already efforts to establish a volunteer fire department. However, it was not founded until twenty-one years later, on June 15, 1887. The largest fire in the history of the fire department occurred in 1977 at the Metzeler production facility. The fire lasted four days and proved so difficult to control that professional fire departments from Munich and Augsburg, as well as a foam fire truck from the Frankfurt airport fire department, had to be called in. However, the fire brigade was not only an association, but also a municipal institution. This dual nature has only been legally clarified since the publication of the Bavarian Fire Brigade Act (BayFwG) in 1985, according to which the fire buff is a municipal institution, but the fire buff association exists alongside it.\nThe fire department's fire engine currently consists of the following vehicles:\n\nTank fire-fighting vehicle 16/25 (Florian Amendingen 21–1)\nLF8-TS fire-fighting vehicle (Florian Amendingen 48–1)\nCrew transport vehicle (Florian Amendingen 14–1)\nP250 powder extinguishing trailer (usually towed by the LF8-TS fire-fighting vehicle, was decommissioned in 2014)\nOil damage trailer (usually towed by the crew transport vehicle)\nTogether with the LF 16-TS of the Steinheim fire brigade, the vehicles form the third fire brigade of the city of Memmingen. They are the first responders for incidents in the northern industrial area and at the Memmingen autobahn intersection. The vehicles and the clubhouse were housed in the old city hall until April 13, 2019. Since then, the Amendingen Volunteer Fire Department has been housed in the new fire station at Donaustrasse 111. There are currently about 45 active firefighters. The fire brigade also has about 40 passive or supporting members. The junior fire brigade prepares 14 young people for the fire brigade. The service area of the fire brigade also includes the northern industrial area with more than 100 companies.\n\nThe second oldest club is the Amendingen Sports Association. It was founded in 1923 as a gymnastics club. After being disbanded during the war, the club was re-established in 1946. The club offers a wide range of sports. The SVA women's fistball team currently plays in the second national league.\nThe Amendingen Music Association was founded on October 1, 1954. It provides the musical framework for various festivals, participates in competitions and takes care of other musical activities. A drama club, a snuff club and smaller music groups have also been formed. The ABS youth band was founded in 2000 with the neighboring bands from Steinheim and Buxheim. The young musicians of the band from Memmingerberg joined later. In 2002, the board of directors decided to establish the Amendingen Youth Music Association to further promote young musicians. Through early musical education, even the youngest children are introduced to instruments. The association is a member of the Allgäu-Swabian Music Association. It currently (2008) has 43 active members and is supported by 202 passive members.\n\n\n=== Regular events ===\nSince the inauguration of the fountain in front of the former City Hall on June 2, 1991, the Fountain Festival has been held there every year. The festival is organized alternately by the Fire Department and the Music Association. On the Sunday after St. Ulrich's Day (July 4), the parish fair is held in and in front of the parish hall and church. The traditional wine festival is usually held on the last weekend in September in the Amendingen school gymnasium. On Bonfire Sunday, the first Sunday after Ash Wednesday, a bonfire is usually lit on the Amendingen field in the direction of Grünenfurt.\n\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Economy ===\nAmendingen was agricultural for a long time and was characterized by farms. The oldest company in the village is the special vehicle manufacturer Goldhofer. It developed from Amendingen's village smithy, which was located next to today's Protestant parish hall. Most of the northern industrial estate, the second largest contiguous industrial estate in Swabia, is located in Amendingen. Many companies are world market leaders in their sector. There are the forwarding companies Dachser, Gebrüder Weiss, Epple and Honold. Buzil, a globally active company for cleaning agents, is also based in the industrial estate, as is Goldhofer Inc. from Amendingen, the world's leading manufacturer of special transportation vehicles. A large retail park with retailers is also located on the edge of the industrial estate.\n\n\n=== Traffic ===\nThe district is connected to the national transportation network via the A 96 highway and the Augsburg-Memmingen federal highway (B 300) and to the public transportation system of Memmingen via two bus lines.\nThe Illertal Railway passes the eastern end of the town without stopping. The construction of a stop near the city is planned as part of the Danube-Iller Regional S-Bahn.\n\n\n=== Education ===\nThe first school building, a small brick building, was located next to today's Sparkasse bank. As the number of students increased, the former one-class school was divided into two levels. The small school with the pupils of the 1st and 2nd grades was temporarily located in the old sacristan's house next to the church. The large school, with students from grades 3 to 7, remained in the old brick building. The first large school in Amendingen was built during the period of inflation. In 1954 a third school hall was added, and a few years later another hall in a barrack-like style.\n\nAfter a long search, a plot of land for a new school building was found on the eastern edge of the village. At a cost of approximately two million marks, a school district was created that housed an eight-grade elementary school with a gymnasium. Construction began in October 1964 and the new building was inaugurated on July 16, 1966. Shortly after its completion, however, the school needed to be expanded, as it had become an association school. As a result, enrollment grew rapidly. After frequent and urgent reports of the lack of school space, the expansion of the school was approved in 1985. The school opened at the beginning of the 1987 school year. In 1996, the building was expanded again with the addition of eight more classrooms and subject rooms on the north side of the first expansion. On August 5, 2008, ground was broken for the gymnasium addition.\nThe school consists of an elementary school and a middle school from grades 1 to 9. There is also a middle school from grade 7 to 10. The current school district includes the primary and secondary schools of the Memmingen districts of Amendingen and Eisenburg as well as the politically independent communities of Buxheim (grades 5–9), Heimertingen, Fellheim and Pleß (grades 7–9). The school currently has 570 students and 49 teachers. In 2011, it will be transformed into a primary and secondary school.\nThe Amendingen Elementary School became nationally known in 1979 when a teacher slapped a student and the Bavarian Supreme Court, citing common law, tolerated it. This ruling led to a change in the law in Bavaria, which finally abolished corporal punishment.\n\n\n== Personalities ==\nThe painter Josef Madlener was born in Amendingen in 1881. A postcard reproduction of his painting The Mountain Spirit served the writer J. R. R. Tolkien as inspiration for the wizard Gandalf in the novel The Lord of the Rings.\nFour-time international footballer Franz \"Bulle\" Roth (* 1946), who played for FC Bayern Munich from 1966 to 1978, is also from Amendingen.\nThe former Bavarian Minister of Agriculture Josef Miller (* 1947) lives in Amendingen and is a councillor in Memmingen.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe district on Memmingen.de\nCitizens' Committee Amendingen\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nJoachim Jahn et al.: Die Geschichte der Stadt Memmingen – Von den Anfängen bis zum Ende der Reichsstadt.

        "content": "Verein KlimaSeniorinnen Schweiz v. Switzerland (2024) was a landmark European Court of Human Rights case in which the court ruled that Switzerland violated the European Convention on Human Rights by failing to adequately address climate change. It is the first climate change litigation in which an international court has ruled that state inaction violates human rights.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Climate change in Switzerland ===\n\nAs part of its effort to fight climate change caused by carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, in 2011 Switzerland passed the Federal Act on the Reduction of CO2 Emissions, more commonly called the CO2 Act, which came into force at the start of 2013. The CO2 Act, as enacted, set a target of a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions over 1990 levels by 2020. Several amendments were since added to the CO2 Act, including in response to the Paris Agreement in 2015, with a future target of 50% reductions in emissions compared to 1990 levels by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050.To achieve this, Switzerland primarily worked with the European Union to engage with the established European Union Emissions Trading System (ETS), using \"cap and trade\" emissions trading; policy makers establish emissions caps for companies based on their industry and size. Companies that exceed their emissions allowances are fined, which is meant as an incentive to drive the company to reduce emissions in the future. Companies that fall under their emissions caps are allowed to trade their unrealized emissions on the ETS for financial profit, with companies that exceed emissions able to buy those credits towards offsetting their own excess. The EU established the ETS for all participating countries within the EU, with the intent to incentivise all emission-generating companies within the EU to participate. The EU ETS system was considered as both a means to reduce emissions under both the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement.As 2020 approached, the effectiveness of the EU ETS came into question, as the reductions achieved by the system were more modest than projected; from 2008 to 2016, emissions reductions only dropped by 3.8% greater than emissions changes without the ETS in place. Issues such as corporate profiteering off emissions allowances, emission volatility, and political factors were seen as working against the goals of achieving higher emission reductions through the ETS. The Swiss government took little action and the target of a 20% reduction by 2020 failed to be met, with an emissions reduction of only 11% realized by 2019.State of the Netherlands v. Urgenda Foundation was a 2019 landmark case before the Supreme Court of the Netherlands that found the Dutch government at fault for failing to reach its targeted 25% reduction in emissions by 2020, and that established that fighting climate change was considered a human right under Articles 2 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), the first such time the ECHR was used in relation to climate change.\n\n\n=== Lower courts ===\nKlimaSeniorinnen Schweiz (Senior Women for Climate Protection) is a group of elderly women in Switzerland, initially formed by a group of 40 in 2016, and having grown to a membership of more than 2,500 as of April 2024. The formation of the group was triggered by concerns that the Swiss government was not taking sufficient action to meet the climate change goals of the CO2 Act, which would lead to warmer temperatures and threaten their health, particularly for their members over 75. They started seeking demands from the Federal Council in late 2016, and with legal backing from Greenpeace, filed lawsuits against the government for their inaction. The lawsuit was dismissed through multiple Swiss courts, including the Federal Supreme Court in 2020, ruling that the women's rights were not impacted and instead they should seek political actions.\n\n\n== European Court of Human Rights ==\nWith the Federal Supreme Court's dismissal of their case, KlimaSeniorinnen Schweiz took their complaints to the European Court of Human Rights, which has jurisdiction across the member states of the Council of Europe, in 2020. The case was accepted by the Court and assigned to the Grand Chamber, which typically is reserved for the most important issues related to human rights under the ECHR. The lawsuit was the first environmental-related case heard by the Court. Eight other countries – Romania, Latvia, Austria, Slovakia, Norway, Italy, Portugal and Ireland – joined Switzerland's side in seeking dismissal of the case with the intent that individual states should determine their own climate policies.The Grand Chamber heard arguments on 29 March 2023. The Court issued its decision on 9 April 2024, ruling in favour of the KlimaSeniorinnen Schweiz. In its decision, the Court stated that Switzerland failed to protect its citizens from climate change \"in good time and in an appropriate and consistent manner\", and required the state to reassess and address its climate change goals, with these efforts to be overseen by government representatives from the Council of Europe.Rosmarie Wydler-Wälti, co-president of the KlimaSeniorinnen, called the ruling \"a victory for all generations\", while a Swiss federal office of justice stated the country will evaluate the decision and determine what actions they can take. The decision is considered the first decision from an international court emphasizing that climate change endangers human rights; the ruling applies to all states within the Council of Europe. While the ruling is not expected to directly impact other countries such as the United States, where multiple environmental lawsuits have been filed directly at companies, \"the idea that climate change impaired fundamental rights resonated throughout these cases\", according to Michael Gerrard, a law professor at Columbia Law School.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\n\n\n=== Domestic ===\nThe current President of the Swiss Confederation, Viola Amherd, expressed surprise in her first reaction to the judgment. The Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications said that it will inspect the judgement together with the Federal Swiss office for justice. This office additionally stressed the environmental protection undertakings of the past years, including the 2023 Climate and Innovation Act, which provides for a complete phase-out of fossil energy by 2050.The judgement was widely commented on in Swiss media, with critical reactions dominating domestically. The paper Neue Zürcher Zeitung described the judgement as \"absurd\" and called for a debate about the \"sense and purpose of the European Convention on Human Rights\". The paper Blick said that while the judgement was a \"sensation\", it criticised it as \"alienating, possibly even counterproductive\". The paper Tages-Anzeiger expressed fears of pressures on democracy if \"courts start to determine the course of climate policies\". The paper Republik said the decision was \"significant\", a worldwide precedent.Reactions from politicians in Switzerland were aligned with the relevant political spectrum. Leftist and green parties, among them the Social Democratic Party and the Green Party, praised the court's decision, calling it \"historic\". Mattea Meyer, co-head of the Social Democratic Party, described the judgement of \"Europe's highest court\" as a \"slap in the face for the lower house of the Swiss Parliament\". The head of the Green Liberal Party, Jürg Grossen, described the judgement as \"not surprising\", as it is apparently known that politics does too little for the climate. The liberal FDP and the right-wing conservative Swiss People's Party (SVP) were critical of the decision. FDP member of parliament Christian Wasserfallen described the court's decision as \"absolutely incomprehensible\". The party itself provided no initial reaction. The SVP echoed its criticism of international treaties such as the ECHR, and even called on Switzerland to withdraw from the Council of Europe.\n\n\n=== International ===\nThe German news show Tagesschau believed in its commentary that \"future generations [will] be thankful\" for this judgement, and that future governments will have to face the possibility of other cases like this. Britain's The Guardian spoke of a groundbreaking decision that would increase pressure on governments so that they would not fill the atmosphere with gases that contribute to extreme weather conditions any more. Austria's Der Standard disclosed in its reporting an Austrian climate change case that is still pending. The judgement against Switzerland seems to be \"of significance for all Europe\".Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg celebrated the court's decision at the European Court of Human Rights building.Richard Ekins of the University of Oxford condemned the judgment as \"inventing new obligations on member states in relation to climate change and proclaiming a new power to superintend environmental policy across Europe\" and predicted that it would reignite the debate about British withdrawal from the ECHR. Former Supreme Court of the United Kingdom justice Lord Sumption said that the European Court of Human Rights \"has become an avowed enemy not just of democratic decision-making but of good government\" as a result of the judgment.\n\n\n== See also ==\nClimate litigation\nLliuya v RWE AG (2015) Case No. 2 O 285/15  duty of power company in tort to compensate for climate damage\nNeubauer v Germany (24 March 2021) 1 BvR 2656/18, duty on state to reduce carbon emissions faster than government required in Act to protect right to life and environment\nMilieudefensie v Royal Dutch Shell (26 May 2021) duty of oil company in tort to cut emissions in line with Paris Agreement and right to life\nMcGaughey and Davies v Universities Superannuation Scheme Ltd [2022] EWHC 1233 (Ch), directors' duties to plan to divest fossil fuels in light of Paris Agreement and right to life\nSmith v Fonterra Co-operative Group Ltd [2024] NZSC 5\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJudgment Verein KlimaSeniorinnen Schweiz and Others v.

Folklistan was launched by Jan Emanuel, a former Social Democratic Party MP, and Sara Skyttedal, an MEP previously with the Christian Democrats, in April 2024. They are also the group's main candidates for the European Parliament elections 2024.\nSara Skyttedal was elected Member of the European Parliament in 2019 for the Christian Democrats, who are grouped with the European People's Party. She left the party in February 2024, but remained in parliament as an independent. In early April 2024, it was noticed that she had registered a new party called Folklistan, and it was later launched in Henrik Jönsson's program on YouTube.\n\n\n== History and background ==\nJan Emanuel has long stated that his relationship with the Social Democrats had become cold. He revealed in 2021 that he no longer votes for them, as according to him, the party has abandoned classical social democracy and abandoned the workers, and that \"they're no longer the party that I joined\". He also stated that he's in internal opposition within the party and that he's a \"conservative leftist\" and doesn't have a party which represents him.\n\n\n== Priorities ==\nFolklistan have set \"Top 10 Priorities\", with the first of the 10 priorities being announced on 9 April being:\n\nScrap the right to asylum\nProvide international protection in the immediate vicinity of conflicts\nSend criminals to jail abroad\nEstablish EU cooperation on prisons so that Sweden can freely procure prison care services in the Union\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Alexander Morton (b. 11 September 1854 New Orleans, d. 27 May 1907, Sandy Bay, Tasmania) was an American-born Australian naturalist and museum curator.\nAlexander Morton was born on 11 September 1854 at New Orleans in Louisiana, his father, Thomas William Morton, was a planter and had emigrated to Queensland to take up the position of manager of the Manchester Queensland Cotton Co.. While in Queensland Thomas invested in a sugar plantation but died before it could realise a return leaving Alexander having to support himself and he went to work as a sailor. He was at sea for 2 years working on vessels moving Melanesians to Queensland to work in the plantations and briefly visiting England and Europe before returning to Australia to study natural sciences.\nIn 1877 Morton was took a position as a curator's assistant at the Australian Museum in Sydney and he joined the explorer Andrew Goldie on his expedition to New Guinea. Morton's specimenss, mostly of birds collected in them forests in the vicinity of Port Moresby and from Yule Island, confirmed his abilities as a naturalist and the Museum  sent him to Palmerston, now Darwin. In 1881 he travelled to the Solomon Islands and in 1882 he was on an expedition to explore the Burdekin and Mary rivers in Queensland and Lord Howe Island. When he resigned from his post at the Australian Museum it kept him on as a field collector.\nIn 1884 he was appointed as curator of the Royal Society of Tasmania's Tasmaniam Museum in Hobart and in 1885 when this became the Tasmanian Museum and Botanical Gardens he was reappointed as its curator, also becoming its secretary. He became the director of the museum and botanical gardens in January 1904 and was the secretary of the Royal Society of Tasmania from 1887 until his death. He also helped to establish the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery in Launceston, Tasmania and was an honorary curator of that institution from 1891 up to 1896. Under Morton's stewardship the Museum expanded, adding art galleries as it grew. Morton also relabelled the exhibits using the classification system devised in the British Museum.\nMorton had a number of other posts in Australian science including general secretary of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science. He continued to participate in expeditions.\nMorton was a member of a Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland congregation and he married Caroline Eliza Mills in 1884 and together they had one son and three daughters, including Gwen Morton Spencer. He died of heart disease on 27 May 1907 at Sandy Bay at Whitminster Lodge private hospital and is interred in Cornelian Bay Cemetery.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nMorton had a number of species of fish named after him by fellow Australian naturalists, William John Macleay named three in 1883, but these have all now been synonymised.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "INSIGHT UK is an organisation of British Hindu and British Indian (BHI) communities in the United Kingdom. It has also been called an advocacy group on behalf of these communities.\n\n\n== Organisation ==\nOn its website, the organisation describes itself as a \"social movement\" for raising awareness and campaigning for causes that concern the British Hindu and  Indian (BHI) communities in Britain.\nIt first came to light in 2021 after conducting a survey on the state of Hinduism in the religious education syllabus in British schools. The study found 98 percent of respondents claimed that the study of Hinduism in religious education was low-quality and deficient.\n\n\n== Selected activities ==\nDuring the 2022 Leicester unrest, the organisation issued tweets and narratives on its website describing the events unfolding in the course of the unrest.\nRutgers University's Network Contagion Research Institute, which studied the cyber-swarming before and during the unrest, treated the organisation's twitter handle as a \"Hindu Twittersphere user\",\nwhile another report by Centre for Democracy, Pluralism and Human Rights, cited some of its tweets in its evidence. After the unrest, the organisation led 180 Hindu groups in writing a letter to the British prime minister urging the British authorities to stop hate crimes against the Hindu community.In 2023, INSIGHT UK campaigned against the use of an Indian goddess on the label of a French beer, calling it highly insensitive and disrespectful. In September, it published a minute-long video of a Ganesh Chaturthi event in Leicester, where it accused the police of using excessive force.\nIn October–November, it was listed among the Indian diaspora organisations that protested in support of Israel against the Hamas terror attack.In 2024, INSIGHT UK carried out a nationwide survey regarding the British media with over 2,000 respondents. It was reported that 59 percent of the respondents claimed having experienced prejudice as a result of the British media reporting; 79 percent said that the media reports resulted in negative perception of British Indians. \nIn February, INSIGHT UK wrote an open letter to BBC, Ofcom and the House of Lords, criticising BBC's coverage of the Ayodhya Ram Mandir consecration.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAn article in the International Socialism magazine characterised INSIGHT UK as a Sangh Parivar organisation. It criticised the organisation's report on Hinduism in school education as giving false appearance of scientific analysis, whereas it represented only the views of the organisation's sympathisers.\nThe Muslim news website 5 Pillars UK accused the organisation of using \"far-right tropes\", and targeting Muslims and other minorities in India.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "How'd a White Boy Get the Blues? is an album by the American musician Popa Chubby, released in 2001. It was his first album for Blind Pig Records. Popa Chubby supported the album with a North American tour. The title track was a minor hit in Europe.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe album was produced by Popa Chubby. He played a signature Gibson Flying V, which he chose in tribute to Albert King, as well as a 1966 Stratocaster. He raps on the opening track, \"Daddy Played the Guitar and Mama Was a Disco Queen\". Popa Chubby played most of the instruments, using samples, sitar, slides, and dobro on the album. He thought that most of the songs described finding sustentation in music. \"It's a Sad Day in New York City When There Ain't No Room for the Blues\" criticizes NYC mayor Rudy Giuliani for making the city a less diverse place.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nBillboard called Popa Chubby \"a postmodern bluesman,\" writing that, \"with Chubby, blues is a distinctly urban, free-association groove.\" The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote that Popa Chubby \"melds pungent acoustic blues, fiery blues-rock, horn-kissed soul, rap and electronic touches into the accompaniment for semiautobiographical songs that soulfully explore his passion for the music and the hardships of being a bluesman in the Big Apple.\"\nThe Ottawa Citizen said that \"Chubby's a slash-and-burn guitar player of the first order.\" The Press of Atlantic City labeled the album \"part Robert Johnson, part Meat Loaf.\" The Red Deer Advocate praised the \"upbeat music and sinister themes.\" The Buffalo News concluded that the album \"erupts from the speakers with all of the visceral power of a present-day Muddy Waters.\"\nAllMusic noted that, \"although he's not entirely successful, Popa Chubby hits enough stylistic bases to make this a listenable and often invigorating album which gets extra points for attempting to push past the stereotypical blues clichés and into more experimental waters.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Üçtepe Höyük, is an ancient Near East archaeological site in Diyarbakır Province, Turkey about 40 kilometers southeast of the modern city of Diyarbakır and about 10 kilometers southwest of modern Bismil. The village of Üçtepe is nearby. It was occupied from the Late Early Bronze Age until the Roman period and is notable as the discovery location of the Kurkh Monoliths. The ancient site of Ziyaret Tepe lies 22 kilometers to the west. Other archaeological sites in the area include Pir Hüseyin, Kenan Tepe, Hirbemerdon Tepe, Salat Tepe, Giricano, and Sahin Tepe (Müslüman Tepe).\n\n\n== Archaeology ==\nÜçtepe Höyük covers an area about 400 meters in diameter with a height of about 44 meters, about 12.5 hectares in total. The main mound is about 200 meters by 189 meters in extent.\nThe site (at that time called Kurkh) was first excavated by John George Taylor in 1861 to 1863 and again in 1866 observing \"a high mound and a cluster of lower heaps about its base, situated at the eastern end of an elevated platform evidently the site of a large town on the right bank of the Tigris\" with the high mound topped by a large Parthian fort \"about a mile in circumference\". In the soil by the fort Taylor found the two Neo-Assyrian period Kurkh Monoliths, dating to the reigns of Ashurnasirpal II (883–859 BC) and his son Shalmaneser III. The site (referred to as Kirkh) was next examined, during an area survey, by Albert T. Olmstead in 1907.\nThe Üçtepe Höyük was excavated between 1988 and 1992 by a joint Diyarbakır Archaeological Museum and Istanbul University team led by Veli Sevin. Using step trench excavation on the east side of the main mound they found that the top 7 to 8 meters of the mound dated to the Roman and Hellenistic periods and the next lowest 4 meter layer dated to the Neo-Assyrian period. One Middle-Assyrian (Stratum 9) grave was found bearing grave goods including eight gold earrings and an engraved cylindrical bone box. In total 12 trenches were excavated on the mound, 3 on the northwest, 1 on the north, 6 on the southeast, 1 on the south, and 1 on the west. The main focus of the excavation was on the Neo-Assyrian period.\nDuring the excavations 23 Classical period coins were found. A cuneiform tablet, from the reign of Shalmaneser I (c. 1273–1244 BC), was also discovered.\n\n\n== History ==\nÜçtepe Höyük was occupied from the Late Early Bronze Age until the Roman Imperial period. The excavators defined 13 stratigraphic layers. Virgin soil was not reached and Chalcolithic (4th millennium BC) pottery sherds were found on the surface. Excavation area of the Early Bronze layers was very small while for the Middle Bronze the area was 17.5 meters by 7.5 meters permitting the identification of monumental construction with 2 meter wide walls and wide corridors.\n\nStratum 13 – Early Bronze Age III\nStratum 12 – Early Bronze Age IV\nStratum 11 – Middle Bronze Age. Monumental building.\nStratum 10 – Late Bronze Age. Domestic occupation only\nStratum 9 – Middle Assyrian. Single building with 2 floor levels.\nStratum 8 – Early Neo-Assyrian\nStratum 7 – Late Neo-Assyrian. Substantial building.\nStratum 5-6 – Hellenistic period\nStratum 1-4 – Roman Imperial\n\n\n=== Ancient name ===\nInitially, in 1865, the Üçtepe Höyük was identified by Henry Rawlinson as the Neo-Assyrian city of Tooskan (Tushhan). The modern excavators of the site supported that identification. At one point the site was proposed to be Tidu, a Neo-Assyrian satellite of Tušḫan and with the Mitanni period Ta’idu. This was later disproved. The Mitanni capitols of Washukanni and Taite hve also been proposed.\nBased on a cuneiform tablet found at the site it has been proposed that Üçtepe Höyük\nwas Šināmum in the Middle Assyrian period and Sinābu in the Neo-Assyrian period.\n One of the few textual references to Šināmum was found in an Old Babylonian period text at Tell Shemshara.\n\n\"... Another matter: the lands of Šinamum and Tušḫum are on a par with Elaḫut itself; but there is no prince (madārum) guiding it, so they are looking to Elaḫut for leadership. If my lord would order it, my messengers should keep on going to these people, so that with 20 manas of silver I could bribe them and make them the enemy of the ruler of Elaḫut in a very short time.   ...\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nCities of the ancient Near East\nChronology of the ancient Near East\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBartl, Peter Vinzenz, \"The Upper Tigris – Cultural Autonomy or Interdependence?

It was mentioned in the Chinese annals of the Tang period (618-907 AD) as a dependency on the trans-Mekong trade route from the ancient city of Chiaochih (jiāo zhǐ 交趾; Giao chỉ; near the present-day Vinh of Vietnam) to India.: 25–72  Wen Dan sent representatives to China in 656 – 661, 717, 753, 771, and 798.Initially, Wen Dan was believed to be either Vientiane, or the capital of the Land Chenla (Po-Lou),: 16   but according to the location given in the annals as well as archaeological evidence, it is supposed to be in Chi River basin, centered in Kantharawichai, with Mueang Fa Daet Song Yang as outer center and Champasri (จัมปาศรี; in present Na Dun district) as the vassal. Several historical evidences supports the connection between Wen Dan and Si Thep in central Thailand.: 91–92 According to the Dvaravati Buddhist boundary stones (Bai sema) dated the 8th century found on Mt. Kulen, Woodward (2003) proposes that Wen Dan once controlled the Angkor region before Jayavarman II proclaimed the independence of the Kambujadesa from Java in 802.: 87–88  Jayavarman II probably either defeated Wen Dan and then moved the capital from Indrapura to Yaśodharapura in the north,: 87  or formed ally with the communities in Mun and Chi watersheds to against Si Thep in the west.: 93 \n\n\n== Records ==\nAfter the Tang Dynasty was defeated by Nanzhao in the trade routes conflicts in 753 and 755, the King of Wen Dan sent his son and 26 generals to China to help the fight.In 766, a Tang army of 70,000, led by General Li Mi from Sichuan, invaded Nanzhao. Vietnamese Governor \"He Lu Guang\" joined Wen Tan in attacking the south, but Ko-lo-Feng, the Nanzhao king, captured General Li and won. Wendan's army returned home. In 771, the prince of Wen Dan went to China and was titled \"Special Highest Local Commander,\" equal to the King of Nanzhao, and was even higher than the Chinese governors in Vietnam and Guangzhou.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n== References ==",

The center of the former Larinsky village council, which also included the village named after Mykola Shchors (now renamed Mikhail Kalinin).

In the same year, in the Kizlyar canton, the committee created the Larinskoye village council, which consisted of two resettlement villages named after Larin and named after Mykola Shchors. 108 families from among the land-poor Mountain Jews were resettled to the village of Larinskoye. The socio-cultural disorder of the village, as well as the lack of water in it, led to the fact that by the beginning of the 40s the village was abandoned. \n\n\n== Literature ==\nThe agrarian question and the resettlement of the highlanders of Dagestan to the plain (1920–1945): Documents and materials.

When the parish responsibilities of the rural church of San Pietro in Neure were transposed inside the medieval walls of the town and into this church, the rededication occurred. A major refurbishment took place in the 18th-century, when it was enlarged to have three aisles, under the designs of Antonio Zannoni. Some of the interior columns derive from the earlier Romanesque church. Iin a survey of 1896, the interior of the church had altarpieces including a Concezione by Ranieri del Pace; a Resurrection and Saints by Santi di Tito; and two marble alatar by Marco Moretti. In the church museum is a Reliquary of Santa Barbara, attributed to Benvenuto Cellini or one of his followers.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Dryopteris villarii, commonly known as the rigid buckler fern, is a perennial leptosporangiate fern native to Central and South East Europe as well as the Western Caucasus. It was first described in 1915.\n\n\n== Description ==\nDryopteris villarii typically reaches heights around 30 to 60 cm. The rigid, leathery fronds are of a matt glaucous to dark green colour, with scaly reddish petioles and rachis. Fronds may present tufted, erect or spreading. The short bipinnate leaflets are slightly dentate and narrowly oblong-lanceolate, attenuating closer to the base, with yellowish aromatic glands on either side. Rhizomes are far creeping and adventitious, horizontal to ascending. Sori between 0.7 mm to 1 mm, usually with glandular indusium and arranged in two rows along the midrib, usually four to six per row. They do not cover the apex.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nDryopteris villarii appears within dolomite and limestone pavements, scree, cliffsides, rocky outcrops, scrub and non-alpine and non-saline grasslands. It is found between 500 m to 2000 m. It is tolerant of any soil type although prefers alkaline.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

She is president of the Sindicato dos Trabalhadores da Actividade Seguradora, a union for people working in the insurance industry, and in the 2024 national election she was elected to be a deputy in the Portuguese Assembly of the Republic, representing the Castelo Branco District as a member of the Portuguese Socialist Party (PS).\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nCaixinha was born on 31 August 1976. She obtained a degree in sociology from ISCTE – University Institute of Lisbon in 1999 and a master's from the same university in the science of work and labour relations in 2022, with a thesis on Trade Unions in the Digital era, an example of which is that collective bargaining and conciliation processes are  being carried out online in Portugal. She has also taken courses in training, parental coaching and neurolinguistics.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 2008, Caixinha became director of the Sindicato dos Trabalhadores da Actividade Seguradora (STAS), a union for insurance workers, based in the Portuguese capital of Lisbon. She is also the proprietor of a company called Growise, which offers life-coaching services.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nIn 2017, she was elected as a member of the parish assembly of Pinhal Novo, a small town in the Palmela municipality, southeast of Lisbon. In the same year she became a member of the Palmela municipal assembly. In the 2024 national election, called by the president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa after the resignation of the prime minister António Costa, leader of the PS, following allegations of corruption against members of his government, Caixinha was included as second on the list of PS candidates for the Castelo Branco constituency. This caused some controversy as she lived in the Lisbon Region, whereas Castelo Branco is in the centre of the country. There were suggestions that she had been imposed on the constituency party by the head office of the PS. Nevertheless, the PS won two of the four seats available in the constituency, and Caixinha was duly elected to the National Assembly.\n\n\n== References ==",

As of 2024, it is a World Athletics Race Walking Tour Gold level meeting – the highest-level circuit of international race walking competitions.\nThe meeting is organized by the Polish Athletic Association, and it is typically held in April or May.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe race is named after Robert Korzeniowski, Olympic champion in racewalking from Poland. The first edition of the race was organized as a fundraiser for Ukrainian athletes in opposition to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Although a 20 km walk was originally planned for 2022, only a 10 km walk for professionals was contested as a 20 km was contested two weeks later on the same course for the Polish Athletics Championships. From 2023 onwards, the featured race distance was 20 km, along with several shorter distances for youth and masters athletes.\n\n\n== Winners ==\n\nBold indicates meeting record\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Notes ==",

        "content": "Michael Fedechko (February 19, 1937 – September 6, 2019) was a Canadian Anglican bishop and pastor in the Reformed Episcopal Church (REC). From 1993 to 2011, he was bishop ordinary of the Diocese of Central and Eastern Canada. \n\n\n== Biography ==\nFedechko was born to Ukrainian immigrant parents in Myrnam, Alberta, and raised on a family farm. He served in the Canadian Armed Forces in the 1950s and then worked several jobs, including as a newspaper publisher and editor, a radio show host and hotel manager. He married Christine Robinson, and they had three daughters. Fedechko entered ordained ministry in the 1970s; he moved to Temiskaming Shores, Ontario, in 1980 and worked as a guidance counselor at the New Liskeard College of Agricultural Technology while serving bivocationally as rector of Trinity Reformed Episcopal Church in Haileybury. \nThe Reformed Episcopal Church had dwindled in Canada to just three parishes by the early 1990s, when it was decided to create two dioceses and pursue reunification with the U.S. branch of the REC. Follows was elected bishop of the newly formed Diocese of Central and Eastern Canada. On August 29, 1993, he was consecrated by Wilbur Lyle, Royal U. Grote Jr., Robert H. Booth, and Kenneth W. Powell. \nIn 2009, Fedechko retired as bishop, and the small Diocese of Central and Eastern Canada was brought under the oversight of the Diocese of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. However, in 2011, Fedechko and a small number of clergy and churches from the diocese left the REC and joined the Independent Anglican Church Canada Synod, a small continuing Anglican jurisdiction. \nFedechko died in 2019 in Temiskaming Shores.\n\n\n== References ==",

Neither is particularly reliable, and neither can be used to establish notability (and in any case two sources wouldn't be enough). DoubleGrazing (talk) 15:31, 9 April 2024 (UTC)\n\nSaint George the Hungarian, in Russian “Георгий Угрин” and in Hungarian “Sandor,” is a Russian Orthodox saint. One of the earliest records of Saint George the Hungarian is the The Legend of Boris and Gleb, is part of the Primary Chronicle documenting the lives of Saints Boris and Gleb written in 1040 to 1118 by various different authors. Saint George the Hungarian was martyred along side the Saints Boris and Gleb in the year of 1015. In the year of 1071 the trio became the first canonised saints in the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nThe Legend of Saint George the Hungarian:\nThe oldest Saint of the Saints Boris and Gleb, Boris, owned a servant who was from Hungary,Saint George. Saint Boris gifted Saint George a golden necklace as “he was loved by Boris beyond  reckoning”. When Sviatopolk tried to kill Boris and Gleb (due to rivalry and wanting to seize the throne), he sent assassins to Boris’ and Gleb’s house were they and Saint George were in the midst of praying. Suddenly the 4 assassins struck on the back on Boris and he was killed on the spot. Saint George grasped the body of Saint Boris’ body and cried out “I will not be left behind, my precious lord! Ere the beauty of thy body begins to wilt, let it be granted that my life may end.” The assassins tore Saint George away and stabbed him, his body was flung out of the tent. After Saint George’s death the assassins noticed the golden necklace and they tried to rip it out of his neck but it failed, so they cut of his head and stole the necklace.\nSaint George the Hungarian’s Legacy:\nThe saint’s story became popular around the 14th century, with countless icons being made on their honour. The most famous of these icons however were from the Church of Saint Boris and Gleb in the Russian City of Kolomna. Due to the popularity of Saint Boris and Gleb in the Russian Orthodox Church the popularity of Saint George waned. Due to that, he is mostly unknown to some people. His feast day is on the 24th July.",

        "content": "Vera Spencer (1926 – 14 January 2021) was a British painter and textile designer, whose work has been described as constructivist and modernist. Her work is exhibited and preserved in several public collections, including the Arts Council, the Tate gallery. Art historian Herta Wescher was a keen collector of her work. \n\n\n== Biography ==\nVera Spencer was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia in 1926 but moved with her family to the United Kingdom in 1936. She attended the Slade School of Fine Art and the Central School of Arts and Crafts between 1946 and 1949. She married the British designer Herbert Spencer, who founded the journal of typography Typographica in 1949 and taught typography at the Central School from 1949 to 1955.  \nSpencer was one of the new, progressive abstract artists and contributed to many groundbreaking exhibitions from the early 1950s. She was associated with several artistic groups at the time, including the Constructionists, the Independent Group, and the Modern Movement.\nHer friendship with Paule Vézelay and links with Groupe Espace in Paris led to her joining the English branch, where she participated in their inaugural exhibition at the Royal Festival Hall in 1955.\nVera Spencer died in west London on 14 January 2021, aged 94.\nAlastair Grieve mentions Saunders in his 2005 book \"Constructed Abstract Art in England After the Second World War: A Neglected Avant-Garde\". She is also named in art historian Alan Fowler's 2006 PhD thesis \"Constructive Art in Britain 1913 – 2005\".\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n\n\n=== Solo ===\n\n\n=== Group ===\n\n\n== Works in Public Collections ==\nArts Council Collection London\nTate Britain\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nConstructivist Art in Britain 1913–2005 by Alan Fowler (2006)\nTate Gallery Collection",

He was among the top scorers in the under-12 division in 2017. In 2019, he helped the club win the U15 league championship. Toves and Kanoa repeated the feat in 2021. When the same league was suspended because of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Toves was tied Kohtaro Goto as the league's top scorer with eight goals in five matches.\nIn 2021, he played for the U17 national team, known as the Teen Ayuyus, in the Marianas Soccer League 1. He remained with the club through 2022. By 2023, Toves had returned Kanoa FC in MSL1.\n\n\n== International career ==\nIn 2022, Toves was part of the squads that competed in 2023 AFC U-17 Asian Cup qualification and 2023 AFC U-20 Asian Cup qualification. In preparation for the latter, he scored in a friendly against Guam as part of a training camp in Dededo. He was called up to the national under-23 team in August 2023 for the Marianas Cup against neighboring Guam. Toves scored two goals in his team's second match of the competition. The 2023 edition of the tournament marked the first-ever win for the Northern Mariana Islands since the cup's founding in 2007. Toves was then named the competition's most valuable player. Later in August, he was named the Northern Mariana Sports Association Male Student Athlete of the month. \nToves was called up to the senior national team in November 2023 for the 2023 Pacific Games. He made his senior debut on 18 November against Fiji in the team's opening match. Later in the competition, he appeared in his country's 4–0 win over American Samoa. The victory was the Northern Mariana Islands' first-ever win in the Pacific Games and first over a full member of the Oceania Football Confederation. Toves scored his first senior international goal against Tuvalu on 30 November in his team's final match of the competition. \nIn February 2024 Toves was nominated as the Northern Mariana Sports Association Male Student Athlete of the Year for 2023 because of his performances in both the Marianas Cup and Pacific Games. In April 2024, he was named to the senior squad again for a pair of 2024 Marianas Cup matches against Guam. In the first match, Toves opened the scoring in the eighth minute of the eventual 2–1 victory.\n\n\n=== International goals ===\nScores and results list Northern Mariana Islands' goal tally first.\n\n\n=== International career statistics ===\nAs of match played 7 April 2024.\n\n\n== Personal ==\nToves is the brother of fellow Northern Mariana Islands international Merrick Toves. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMarkus Toves at National-Football-Teams.com\nMarkus Toves at Global Sports Archive\nMarkus Toves at Soccerway",

        "content": "Microscopical researches into the accordance in the structure and growth of animals and plants is a famous treatise by Theodor Schwann published in 1839 which officially formulated the basis of the cell theory. The original title was Mikroskopische Untersuchungen über die Uebereinstimmung in der Struktur und dem Wachsthum der Thiere und Pflanzen. The book has been called \"a conspicuous milestone in nineteenth century biology\" by Karl Sudhoff and \"epoch making\" By Francis Münzer. The book, originally published in German, was translated to English in 1847 by Henry Spencer Smith in an edition that also contained the treatise Phytogenesis, by Matthias Schleiden.Besides the theoretical work, that Schwann called a \"philosophical\" section of general anatomy, Schwann provided several plates with drawings of cells and tissues and discussions of observations of other microscopists. \n\n\n== Cell theory ==\nSchwann dedicated a chapter of the treatise to explicitly formulate the cell theory, stating that (\"the elementary parts of all tissues are formed of cells” and that “there is one universal principle of development for the elementary parts of organisms... and this principle is in the formation of cells\" (Henry Smith's translation, 1847). His book had the goal to prove via observations  that the cell theory put forth for plants by Matthias Schleiden was equally valid for animals. \n\n\n== Schwann cell ==\nThe book is credited with the first description of what would later be called Schwann cell, a type of glial cell. The description of the cells was evident from passages such as: \nSome, however, appear to remain for a longer period; occasionally, although rarely, a cell-nucleui is here and there seen upon the side of a nerve (the white substance of which is completely developed), lying in the pale border, which surrounds the white substance. Fig. 9,c and d, exhibits them from the nervus vagus of a calf.\nand\n\nPl. 4, fig. 6  represents a portion of the ischiatic, and fig.7, of the brachial nerve of such a foetus. We observe a palish, and very minutely-granulated cord, which, in consequence of certain longitudinal shadings, such as the delineation exhibits, presents the appearance of a coarse fibrous structure. Round or for the most part oval corpuscles, which are immediately recognized as cell-nuclei, and which sometimes also contain one or two nucleoli, are generally seen in the course of these shaded parts,throughout the entire thickness of the cord.\n\n\n== Metabolism ==\nThe book is also credited with the introduction of the term \"metabolism\" for the following quote in the chapter \"Theory of Cells\": \nThe question, then, as to the fundamental power of organised bodies resolves itself into that of the fundamental powers of the individual cells.”… These phenomena may be arranged in two natural groups: first, those which relate to the combination of molecules to form a cell; secondly, those which result from chemical changes either in the component particles of the cell itself or in the surrounding cytoblastema, and may be called metabolic phenomena (implying that which is liable to occasion or suffer change)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Typus Religionis (Model of Religion) is a large allegorical painting that depicts a galleon ship as a representation of faith. It is currently on display in the Hotel de Soubise in Paris. The government of France confiscated the work from the Jesuit College in Billom in 1762 as evidence in a trial of the Billom Jesuits. Of particular importance in the criticism of the painting is its depiction of the Pope and King Henri IV of France being pulled behind the main ship of faith in what is often called the secular ship, suggesting that they rely on Jesuits for a path to salvation. The painting was instrumental in the trial, which led to the expulsion of the Jesuits from France. The prosecution claimed that the painting was blasphemous and showed a lack of respect for the papacy and monarchy, evidence of the Jesuits' arrogance and potential threat to the church and nation.The large painting measures approximately 3 metres by 1.8 metres (10 by 20 feet). The main ship of faith has many Christian figures on it, with St. Ignatius of Loyola, a co-founder of the Jesuit order, at the centre. Other religious orders are also represented on the ship by St. Francis of Assisi (Order of Friars Minor), St. Bruno of Cologne (Order of Carthusians), St. Dominc (Order of Preachers), St. Basil (Eastern monasticism), and St. Anthony (Western monasticism). The ship of faith in the centre of the painting sails toward a golden port of salvation on the left, floating above a sea of sins. Some people on the ship throw rocks at boat full of demons (lower left) and resist attacks from heretics (lower right). As the ship sails, it collects souls and guides other smaller vessels toward the port of salvation.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Civic Democratic Party (Serbian Cyrillic: Грађанска демократска партија, romanized: Građanska Demokratska Partija; abbr. ГДП / GDP) was a Serbian political party that existed from 2023 to 2024. It joined the Serbia Against Violence (SPN) coalition on 3 November 2023 and took part in Serbia's December 2023 elections. Its leader was Dr. Miroslav Ilić.\nThe GDP was closely associated with the Movement of Free Citizens (PSG). All GDP-endorsed candidates who were elected in the 2023 Serbian parliamentary election and the 2023 Belgrade City Assembly election were members of the PSG, and both of the GDP-endorsed candidates elected in the 2023 Vojvodina provincial election later joined the PSG. (The PSG was not a registered political party at the time of the 2023 elections and, from the standpoint of Serbia's electoral law, could not formally endorse its own candidates.)\nThe GDP merged outright into the Movement of Free Citizens after the 2023 elections, giving its party registration to the PSG.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Civic Democratic Party came into existence in late 2023, when Vojvodina's Party (VP) permitted the new party to take its official registration. In October 2023, the GDP entered an alliance with the Movement of Free Citizens and various citizens' groups in Vojvodina. \nWhen the GDP joined the Serbia Against Violence coalition the following month, Novi Sad's Radio 021 observed that the party was not generally known to the public.\n\n\n=== 2023 Serbian parliamentary election ===\nThe GDP received nine places on the SPN's electoral list in the 2023 Serbian parliamentary election. The list won sixty-five seats, and the three GDP-endorsed candidates who appeared in the top sixty-five positions were elected: Anna Oreg (#15), Pavle Grbović (#34), and Vladimir Pajić (#50). All were members of the Movement of Free Citizens.\n\n\n=== 2023 Vojvodina provincial election ===\nThe SPN coalition won thirty seats in the 2023 Vojvodina provincial election. Two GDP-endorsed candidates were elected: party leader Miroslav Ilić (#10) and Svetlana Kozić (#27). Kozić was the leader of the local Kikinda political initiative \"Banat je u pravu\" (Banat Is Right), which was also aligned with the PSG. \nAfter the GDP merged into the Movement of Free Citizens, Ilić became the leader of the PSG's Vojvodina provincial board, and Kozić became the leader of its municipal board in Kikinda.\n\n\n=== 2023 local elections ===\nThe SPN coalition won forty-three seats in the 2023 Belgrade City Assembly election. Three of the coalition's successful candidates were PSG members who held formal endorsements from the GDP: Stefan Simić (#12), Jelena Banjac (#26), and Ivana Mandić (#39).\nCandidates endorsed by the GDP were also elected in other cities.\n\n\n== After the 2023 elections ==\nIn early 2024, the Civic Democratic Party permitted the Movement of Free Citizens to take over its party registration and ceased to exist as a separate organization.\n\n\n== References ==",

Later in 2017, Pathumsriwirot lost the license to a local organizer, Weerasak Phetkaew (วีระศักดิ์ เพชรแก้ว), who organized the first Miss Grand Phatthalung contest on 23 March of that year, and Ratiyaporn Chukaew was announced the winner.\nThe pageant was skipped once; in 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand, the national organizer was unable to organize the national event, and the country representative for the international tournament was appointed instead.\n\nWinner gallery\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Editions ==\nThe following table details Miss Grand Phatthalung's annual editions since 2016.\n\nNotes\n\n\n== National competition ==\nThe following is a list of Phatthalung representatives who competed at the Miss Grand Thailand pageant.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Miss Grand Phatthalung at Wikimedia Commons\nMiss Grand Thailand official website",

He taught logic (rhetoric), ethics and metaphysics at the Serampore College.\nLeechman was born in Glasgow and went to Bristol Baptist Academy (1825-29) under William Ward and then Glasgow University where he studied philosophy under Robert Buchanan and James Mylne. He received an MA in 1832 and was commissioned to the Serampore Mission by Christopher Anderson. He joined the Baptist mission and was posted to Serampore College in India. In 1833 he married Mary, daughter of Rev. George Barclay of Kilwinning. After the death of William Carey, he became a co-pastor with John Mack and Joshua Marshman. He taught logic at the Serampore college and wrote a treatise on the 'Science and Art of Reasoning'. In 1837 he returned home due to his wife's poor health. He succeeded his father-in-law George Barclay as pastor at Irvine (Ayrshire) from 1839, serving later at Hammersmith (London) and Bath. He received an LLD from Glasgow in 1859.\nThe Leechmans on return to Britain were involved in resolving conflicts between the Serampore mission and the home committee. \nLeechman's textbook of Logic included a history from Aristotle to J.S. Mill with critiques of John Locke and Isaac Watts. He also wrote about temperance in The Abstinence Principle (1842) and argued for scriptural guidance against drunkenness.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nElements of Logic (1836)\nLogic: Designed as an Introduction to the Study of Reasoning (1864, 4 ed.)\nBiography",

        "content": "In Islam, the Arabic language is the liturgical language and it is given more importance than any other language, because it is the language of Qur'an and Hadith, which is the main religious sources of Islam, which is called Quranic Arabic.\nClassical Arabic, or Qur'anic Arabic, is the language of the Quran. Muslims believe the Qur'an as divine revelation—it is a sacred and eternal document, and as such it is believed to be the direct word of God. Thus Muslims hold that the Qur'an is only truly the Qur'an if it is precisely as it was revealed—i.e., in Classical Arabic. Translations of the Qur'an into other languages are therefore not treated as the Qur'an itself; rather, they are seen as interpretive texts, which attempt to communicate a translation of the Qur'an's message. Salah and other rituals are also conducted in Classical Arabic for this reason. Scholars of Islam must learn and interpret the Qur'an in classical Arabic. According to the four accepted Sunni schools of jurisprudence, it is a requirement for the khutbah to be delivered completely in classical Arabic.\n\n\n== In the Qur'an ==\nIt is said in the Qur'an, Allah says,\n\n'I have sent down the Qur'an in clear Arabic.'\nIn the explanation of this verse,  Allama Abul Hussain Ahmad bin Fares said,\n\n'Allah has called the Qur'an a clear word.  This means that other languages do not have this feature and the Arabic language is superior to all other languages. As Sahabi fi Fiqhil Lugah: 4/1\n\n\n== In the hadith ==\nMuhammad said,\nمَنْ ‌قَرَأَ ‌حَرْفًا ‌مِنْ ‌كِتَابِ ‌اللَّهِ ‌فَلَهُ ‌بِهِ ‌حَسَنَةٌ، وَالحَسَنَةُ بِعَشْرِ أَمْثَالِهَا، لَا أَقُولُ الم حَرْفٌ، وَلَكِنْ أَلِفٌ حَرْفٌ وَلَامٌ حَرْفٌ وَمِيمٌ حَرْفٌ\n\n‘Whoever recites a letter of the Book of Allah Ta'ala has its reward.  And the reward is tenfold.  I do not say that Alif-Lam-Meem is a letter, but Alif is a letter, Lam is a letter and Meem is a letter.'  [Sunan Tirmidhi, Hadith: 2910]\nMost Muslim scholars agree that the hadith of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad says every letter of the Qur'an brings ten unit of piety (Sawab). For this reason, they emphasize pronouncing the original Islamic Arabic word \"Allah\" (ﷲ),,Nabi\" (نبي), \"Rasul\" (رسول), \"Malaika\" (ملاءكة‎)\"jannah\" (جنّة‎), \"jahannam  \" (جهنم‎) etc., as an argument they say, the word Allah is used in the Qur'an, so when saying the word, ten unit of sawab or neki will be obtained, which cannot be gotten by the pronunciation of Khuda, Creator, Ishwara, God, paygambar, Farishta, Behesht, Duzakh or other non-Quranic and non-Arabic synonyms.\n\n\n== Opinion of Salaf and Scholars ==\nUmar bin Khattab said,\n\nLearn Arabic language. That is part of your deen. Ibn Taymiyyah said,\nArabic language is the symbol of Islam and its people (Muslims). He further said,\nAllah revealed the Qur'an in Arabic andd instructed the  beloved Prophet (PBUH) to  preach the Qur'an-Sunnah in Arabic. The first followers of the religion were Arabic speaking.  Therefore, there is no substitute for mastering this language for deep knowledge of religion. Practicing Arabic is part of religion and a symbol of respect for religion.\nAccording to Islamic scholars, \"The reason for the importance of the Arabic language is that the Arabic language has many advantages and characteristics, but what has given it the greatest importance is its connection with the religion of Islam revealed in this language. The connection of the Arabic language with the revelation of the Qur'an, which came to all mankind.  The rituals of Islam are performed only in the Arabic language. The Arabic language is characterized by sophistication of expression, eloquence in speech and abundance of artistic imagery. According to scholars, to preserve the Arabic language is to preserve the religion of Islam. A complete statement of a written text can only be made in Arabic,  And so the Qur'an was not revealed without it. Constantly speaking Arabic has a positive effect on the mind, religion and morals. Ignorance of Arabic is one of the causes of deviation from the true religion. Arabic is an ancient, stable and historically well-established language.\"\n\n\n=== Reasons for praying Salat in Arabic ===\nScholars claimed reasons for praying in Arabic including Ahmed Hussain Sharif in his book \"Why Pray in Arabic\" (Why is prayer offered in Arabic?)  are:\n\nArabic is a deep and wide language\nA common and universal language for prayer\nConnecting the Islamic brotherhood (via Arabic)\nQuran is the creation of Allah\nIt is impossible to translate the complete and complete Quran\nQuran is the only (divinely) preserved revelation\nQuran has its own rhythm\nThe difference between Dua and Namaz is: Dua is an invitation or supplication, which is optional, so it is relaxed and can be done in any language, and Salat is a prayer, which is obligatory and its principles are strict. Besides, there is an obligation to maintain the social relations of Muslims in the case of obligatory prayers in congregation, therefore, prayers must be read only in Arabic.\nLearning to understand Arabic prayers is not difficult and it is easy.\nFinally he says, \"Thus we see that the sweetness, dignity, beauty and spirituality of the prayer depend on the prayer being recited in the original Arabic; and if the prayer is recited in translation, the literary and artistic value of the Qur'an is bound to be lost; and  by the translated prayer is the first to suffer will be the Islamic brotherhood.\"\n\n\n== Opinions of non-Muslim scholars ==\nElwood Morris Wherry said that the reason of the revelation of Quran in Arabic is as same as the reason of the revelation of Tora in Hebrew. Reciting Quran in original Arabic in prayers is considered a divine command by Muslims. In a question answer about a maulavi who recites quran and other supplications in prayer in Hindustani language, a mufti of madras in 1880 answered: 'According to the Imáms Shafa'i, Málik and Hanbal, it is illegal to use a translation of the Qurán when saying the Namáz (prayers), whether the worshipper is ignorant of Arabic or not. Moreover, from the Quran itself the recital of it in Arabic is proved to be a Divine command (farz). The word Qurán means, too, an Arabic Qurán, for God speaks of it as a revelation in Arabic. The words, Recite so much of the Qurán as may be easy to you' (Súra lxiii. 20), prove the duty of reciting it; while the words, An Arabic Qurán, have we sent it down' (Súra xiii. 2), show that the Qurán to be used is an Arabic, not a Hindustani one. The person alluded to is an infidel, for he tries to make out that the Ulema of all preceding ages, who have instructed the people from the days of the Prophet till now to read Arabic in the Namáz, are sinners. The result of the use of translations as recommended by him, would be that a number of different translations of the Quran would get into circulation, and thus the text, like that of the Christian Scriptures, would become corrupt. Our decision is that the usual salutations should not be made to this person. If he dies he must not be buried in a Musalman cemetery. His marriages are void and his wives are at liberty. All who assist him are infidels. To send children to be taught by him, to purchase newspapers which advocate his views, and to read his translations, are unlawful acts.\" Almost all Muslims believe that the Arabic Quran that they carry today is an exact duplication of the heavenly transcript that Muhammad received by dictation from Allah by way of the angelic messenger Gabriel and found in Heaven at Miraj. For many centuries, Arabic served as the linguistic vehicle through which many of Islamic civilization's religious, cultural, and intellectual achievements were articulated and refined. To Muslims, reciting Quran in prayers other than Arabic such as Persian or any other language is strictly forbidden.\nMuslim tradition qualifies Quranic Arabic as the chastest language, that Muhammad spoke the most undefiled speech among all the Arabs and, consequently, that the language of his people, the Quraysh, was the purest Arabic. It was inevitable that, as a result of the reverence reserved to Qur'anic Arabic, Quranic usage became the linguistic standard and the criterion by which Muslim scholars regulated themselves.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSacred language\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHaq, Ijazul (18 December 2020). \"Islam and the Arabic Language\".

They worship bear for it's power while dog and pig were domesticated for their economic value. These people abandoned their bone carving technology after learning early metal work and spoke Proto indo euorpion language . Later entered eastern Europe from north or north east of black sea  which became known as Scythia, and Balkans and there they spoke language called Paleo-Balkan languages . They also  entered Levant up to cannan and introduced Baal and established Babylon in near about 2000 BC through Caspian sea and Anatolia area and spoke Anatolian languages which was later named Parthian art , also found in Mediaeval Europe and Byzantine art which is also known as Greco-Buddhist art of north India on the other hand entered into central Asia through Volga river and they developed cities east of Caspian sea called Merv on silk road today Mari of Turkmanistan, Kath , Khiva known as Khwarazm and Vahlika Kingdomlater known as Greco-Bactrian Kingdom Bactria of Greeks and Balkh of the mediaval  the whole area known Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex since mid 3rd millennium BC.

From that base, he led military campaigns across Western, South, and Central Asia, the Caucasus, and Southern Russia, defeating in the process the Khans of the Golden Horde, the Mamluks of Egypt and Syria, the emerging Ottoman Empire, as well as the late Delhi Sultanate of India ancestors of Indian ruler known as mughal .\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe people called Wahla were said to be the ancient ruler of a kingdom called Vahlika Kingdom of central Asia existed on and before 600BC till 332BC and later called Bactria (satrapy) by Greeks and the center of Greco bactrian kingdom and known by the name Balkh later on . The roots of this kingdom spread across four directions and across the hindu kush as well . The Athervavida Parisista of ramyana associate Vahlikas with Saka Yavanas and Tushara or Tukhara . Menander Iof Greco bactrian made his base in Sakala and established Indo-Greeks (sources) and used the title Basileus meaning monarch or king of king . Another extension  was vallapuraBahlim called by Athervavida Parisista ancient name of jammu and Kashmir . Pravarasena II thought to be the son of Toramana ruler of Alchon Huns or Walxon Huns established Pravarapura / vallapura probably modern Srinagar summer capital of Kashmir  while Vallapura modern Jammu remain for winter . They were first mentioned as being located at Paropamisus and entered in north west India and Europe at the same time period as Attila . The 6th century Roman historian Procopius of Caesarea wrote in his book 1 chapter 3 related the Hun of Europe with who subjugated Sassanids and invaded north west India , stating that they were of samedentary , white skkinned and possessed \" not ugly \" features   . Ephthalities Hun who are called white huns are of stock of huns but do not mingle with any of huns known to us , there territory immediately north of Persia . They are not nomads like the other hunnic people but they established a better and goodly land for the long period before not near or linked the land of other hunnic people . They followed the lawful constitution and ruled by a King possess white bodies and unlike to their kins man  . They observe right and justice not only with each other but with their neighbours too , in no degree less than Roman or persians . Rajatarangini discussed in his book of kalhana about the various kings of this race . Another seat of extension is Vallabhipurain Indian Surashta later known Gujarat . They were the excellent warrior and horse rider and domesticated world's excellent breed of war horses. \nCornel James Tod discussed about this race in his book annals of Mewar and stated the sun of the thirty six royal races of the world .\nThe second emerge of these people named Yuezhi from Altai mountain splited one migrated westword called Da Yuezhi means greater Yuezhi and established Greco Kushan empire based Bactria and the other called lesser Yuezhi and entered through Tibetan plateo and former known as Kushan Empire and also established Mathura  Malwa and Rashtrakuta  Empire alongside Pushkalavati modern Peshawar . The king Kanishka of this empire used the title Vallabha or prithvi Vallabha and linked themself with Greco-Bactrian Kingdom. The Northern Satraps of Rajuvula , Western Satraps and Indo-Scythians also used the title Basileus or bala. Hun of central  Asia also used the title wals wali means King of king in Tocharian at Kunduz named Hephthalites .  In east establish Balhae and Volhynia Governorate in Russia and marched towards Europe up to Wales .\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe site  map of the daysays that Walha is a proto-Germanic word that means \"foreign\"   . and the dictionaray sansagntstated that  Walh (singular) or Walha (plural) (ᚹᚨᛚᚺᚨ) is an ancient Germanic word, meaning \"foreigner\", \"stranger\" or \"roman\". The site  wordaz states that The Anglo-Saxons called the Romano-British *Walha, meaning 'Romanised foreigner' or 'stranger'. The Welsh continued to call area as Welschland, which has the same etymology as the English Welsh (see Walha). In Germany Welsch and Welschland refer to Italy.  The adjectival form is attested in Old Norse valskr, meaning 'French'; Old High German walhisk, meaning 'Romance'; New High German welsch, used in Switzerland and South Tyrol for Romance speakers; Dutch Waals 'Walloon'; Old English welisċ, wælisċ, wilisċ, meaning 'Brythonic'. The forms of these words imply that they are descended from a Proto-Germanic form *walhiska-. and the economy term . Volcae was a confederation of the tribes created after the raid if combined Gauls  in 277 bc.The Volcae tribes were found in southern Gaul, Moravia, the Ebro valley of the Iberian Peninsula, and Galatia in Anatolia Alternatively, the name Uolcae has been derived by some scholars from the PIE name of the wolf, *wḷkʷos. In the  Old English it has also been described as wealc- ('hawk'), which has no known cognate in other Germanic languages, was most likely borrowed from Old Brittonic *wealkos. In particular, the Gaulish personal name Catu-uolcos has an exact parallel in the Welsh cadwalch ('hero, champion, warrior')\nThe debate prove that these people were invaders thus refered to be \"foreigners\" and had good administrative and military abilities and due to which they were refered as wolf and hawks by some scholars.Walhalla\nWalhalla is the German form of Old Norse Valhöll, which is commonly anglicised as Valhalla. These people also believed in a life after death for the warriors who fell while fighting which is similar to the Norse belief which makes it seem like these people are related or desendants of kurgan cave which built tombs for the dead . In short it seems we are discussing WALHA the ancient Germanic and gothic tribe used this term in historical contexts and books that cover this topic may include works on Germanic and Gothic history such as \"The Goth in the fourth century \" by Peter Heather0\nIn the Gothic language, the Goths were called the *Gut-þiuda ('Gothic people') or *Gutans ('Goths)or jat in India means \"archer\" establish Gothland in Europe also called Jutland .we also found the ancient Gutian rule in Mesopotamia .The Proto-Germanic form of the Gothic name is *Gutōz, which co-existed with an n-stem variant *Gutaniz, attested in Gutones, gutani, or gutniskr. The form *Gutōz is identical to that of the Gutes and closely related to that of the Geats (*Gautōz).\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe actual etymology of Walha/Wahla is from proto indo european Welh(chosen one ).In proto italic waleo in Latin valeo which means to rule or be strong. In proto Germanic waldana which also means to rule or be strong. In pre proto Germanic welhdati and veldeti  which means to possess or govern. In proto Celtic it was known as walatros which translates to ruler. In proto tocharian A it was known as wal which means king. In proto tocharian B it was known as walo which also means king. In proto Celtic it was known as walos meaning prince or chief . The term Walha generally means \"chosen one \" the ruler , world ruler , lord , Master , protector , an excellent warrior or one among all is the endonym . The origin or etymology of english word valour,  valiant , validate and valentine is Latin word valar plural of vala according to vocabulary. Com .\n\n\n== References ==",

It promotes a new vision for Shia Muslims in Lebanon opposing the dominance of Hezbollah and Amal.\n\n\n== History ==\nDays after the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war and the Israel-Hezbollah conflict in October 2023, a social media campaign under the slogan \"Lebanon does not want war, so that the past will not be repeated\" was launched. The campaign gradually expanded and took other forms, and the slogan was spread on social media on a wider scale, including a petition signed by Lebanese citizens expressing their rejection of the war (Consensus among the Lebanese). \nShiites Against War launched a Facebook page in early November, which calls to avoid war and emphasizes that not all Shiites belong to the Shiite duo Hezbollah or Amal Movement. It is believed that Ali Khalifeh, the former candidate for the Shiite seat in the Zahrani district, and activist Hadi Mourad, the founders of Taharror movement, are behind the movement.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nThe movement is advocating about the danger of a war in Lebanon and about the evil force that will drag Lebanon to destruction. It call the Shiites in Lebanon to be loyal to their country, and not to their religious closeness to Iran. The movement also promotes Taharror movement.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nShiites Against War on Twitter\nShiites Against War on Facebook",

        "content": "On 17 June 1995, 23-year-old Thai forklift operator Suk Malasri (Thai: สุข มาลาศรี, 1972 – 17 June 1995) was found bludgeoned to death inside his living quarters at a construction site in Sungei Kadut, Singapore. The police managed to identify and arrest a suspect three days after the murder, and the killer, a welder named Thongbai Naklangdon (Thai: ทองใบ นากลางดอน, 1967 – 30 August 1996), confessed to murdering Suk after the victim threatened to seek revenge over a previous physical assault he suffered from four of his colleagues. Although Thongbai later recanted his confession and also claimed that he killed Suk in self-defence during an alleged fight between the both of them, Thongbai was found guilty of murdering Suk and sentenced to death by the High Court, which rejected his defence. Thongbai's appeal was dismissed, and he was hanged on 30 August 1996.\n\n\n== Murder investigation ==\nOn 17 June 1995, at at a construction site in Singapore's Sungei Kadut, a Thai national was found murdered inside his sleeping quarters at the site.\nThe victim was identified as 23-year-old Suk Malasri, who was a forklift operator employed at the same site where his murder took place. He was found half-naked and clad in his shorts, and with his head bloodied. The police, who happened to arrive at the site to respond to an incident of arson, discovered the death of Suk when they were seeking his assistance in their investigations, given that Suk was a suspect in this unrelated case. Upon this discovery, the death of Suk was classified as murder, and at least 40 construction workers present at the site were rounded up for questioning, although 27 of them were detained in police custody for purpose of investigations.\nIt was revealed that prior to the murder, there had been an alleged dispute between Suk and some other workers over a prostitute, and during an argument in midst of a drinks session, Suk reportedly broke a bottle of strong alcohol and started a fire, which caused one of the other co-workers to get burnt on his left arm, legs and body, and the co-worker, who was the one and only victim in this arson case, was sent to Singapore General Hospital for treatment, and his condition was stabilized as of the time when the police investigators, led by Richard Lim Beng Gee, began to take up the case. Also, it was reported that the Thai workers employed and residing in that area itself would often gather together for drinks on the 16th and/or 17th day of each month, when their monthly salaries were paid to them, and prostitutes would also be engaged regularly during these sessions, which also saw drunken fights occurring between the workers.\nA forensic pathologist conducted an autopsy on Suk, and it was discovered that Suk suffered multiple head injuries that were caused by a blunt object and inflicted about four to five times with great force. The injuries of Suk, based on the pathologist's findings, were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of Suk.\nAfter three days of investigation, the police managed to arrest a suspect behind the murder. The suspect, who was Suk's 27-year-old colleague and welder Thongbai Naklangdon, was charged with murder, and he also brought the police back to the crime scene, where they recovered an iron rod, which was the same murder weapon used by Thongbai, who confessed during investigations that he indeed killed Suk.\n\n\n== Trial of Thongbai Naklangdon ==\nOn 31 October 1995, 28-year-old Thongbai Naklangdon was brought to trial at the High Court for the murder of Suk Malasri four months prior. Two defence lawyers Shashi Nathan and Ismail Hamid were assigned by the state to represent Thongbai during his trial, which was slated to run for five days. The prosecution was led by Lau Wing Yum, and the trial was presided over by Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh.\nThe trial court was told that prior to the murder, there had been a past dispute that led to a physical assault, which also resulted in the murder of Suk Malasri. On the eve of the murder, uk reportedly used a knife to threaten the girlfriend of one of his colleagues, and coerced her into having sex with him. While he was attempting to rape the woman, Suk's attempt was cut short by a colleague who stepped in to prevent it. Suk was filled with vengeance over this failure and thus, during a drinks session among the Thai workers in their workplace later that night, Suk deliberately smashed a bottle of strong liquor and used his lighter to start a fire, which caused one of his co-workers to get burned and even sent to the hospital. This sparked an outrage among the other Thai workers present at the session, and four of them even assaulted Suk to punish him. At the end of the assault, Suk remained defiant and he coldly swore revenge outright to those who assaulted him.\nOne of the prosecution's witnesses was Wilai, a Thai worker who went to tend for Suk, who was injured on the head due to the earlier assault. Wilai testified that at around 4am, while Suk was asleep and Wilai himself remained by his side, Thongbai, who was a good friend of Suk, entered the quarters and he aggressively compelled Wilai to come with him to have more drinks or to go to bed, and Wilai chose to go along with Thongbai to drink. During the next 30 minutes or so during the party, Wilai noticed Thongbai leaving the party twice at irregular points of time before he finally returned and stayed on throughout the rest of the session. Dam, another Thai worker who also appeared as a witness, testified that about 30 minutes after Wilai left the sleeping Suk alone, he went into the quarters to check on Suk, and he discovered that Suk had died, but when Dam told the others about the grisly finding, Thongbai simply asked him to remain silent and ordered that everyone go back to sleep. Two hours later, the police, having interviewed the Thai worker who was hospitalized for his burns, proceeded to the site to bring him in for investigations, but ended up discovering his murder and hence began their investigations into the present case. Based on Thongbai's confession, the prosecution adduced that Thongbai felt threatened by Suk's terrifying vow of revenge, and he thus took an iron pipe and wielded it to batter Suk to death with at least three blows to Suk's head while Suk was still asleep in the quarters, which effectively placed Thongbai at the scene of crime when the murder happened.\nThongbai was later called to give his defence, and he elected to do so. On the stand, Thongbai recanted parts of his confession and he denied that he was the one who killed Suk Malasri. He claimed that he had indeed assaulted Suk but he insisted that prior to this assault, it was the deceased victim Suk who first kicked Thongbai on his groin and wanted to attack Thongbai, which caused Thongbai to swing the pipe at Suk and hit him once or twice, and Suk only fell onto the bed after getting hit. Thongbai claimed that it might have been another person coming into the bedroom after his departure to finish off Suk, and that his actions only constituted as an offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt rather than murder. Aside from this, Thongbai also raised alternative defences to help his case should the court considered him to be the killer of Suk, and he mainly argued that it was a killing done out of self-defense during a sudden fight, and he was also under sudden and grave provocation at the time of the offence.\nOn 17 November 1995, Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh delivered his verdict. In his judgement, Judicial Commissioner Singh found that Thongbai was indeed responsible for murdering Suk Malasri, and it was not likely that another person had entered the sleeping quarters and killed Suk after Thongbai assaulted him and left the scene. The judge thus rejected Thongbai's story, and he also refused to even consider convicting Thongbai of a lesser charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt with a dangerous weapon. With regards to the defences raised by Thongbai, Judicial Commissioner Singh also rejected them on the facts that the accused's testimony totally lacked credibility and they did not hold much weight in the defence's case. The judge additionally ruled that the evidence was inherently clear in proving that Thongbai had intentionally and, with premeditation, inflicted severe head injuries on Suk, such that the injuries were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, and on these grounds, Judicial Commissioner Singh concluded that the prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and there were sufficient grounds to return with a guilty verdict of murder in Thongbai's case.\nAs such, 28-year-old Thongbai Naklangdon was found guilty of murder, and sentenced to death by hanging. Prior to 2013, the death penalty was mandated for murder under Singaporean law.\n\n\n== Appeal ==\nAfter he was sentenced to hang, Thongbai Naklangdon appealed to the Court of Appeal against his murder conviction and death sentence. In the appeal itself, the defence counsel raised the same defences used by Thongbai during his trial for murder, and they also argued that Judicial Commissioner Singh should have given due consideration in Thongbai's statements of striking the victim once or twice instead of unequivocally relying on the forensic pathologist's opinion that four to five blows were inflicted to cause the fatal head injuries on Suk Malasri.\nOn 8 January 1996, Thongbai's appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. The three judges - Chief Justice Yong Pung How, and Judges of Appeal L P Thean (Thean Lip Ping) and M Karthigesu - found that the judicial commissioner was correct to reject Thongbai's testimony and relied on his police statements, and they noted that Thongbai failed to mention the alleged fight preceding the death of Suk in any of his statements, and the original trial judge had the right to draw inferences he saw fit from the evidence he felt should be relied on in spite of the discrepancies. Noting that motive was not a prerequisite to guilt, the appellate court determined that Thongbai had gone to approach Suk with the intent to stop him from wreaking further havoc among the construction workers and his claims of having struck Suk only once or twice was inconsistent with the evidence, which showed that the injuries were intentionally inflicted through four or five blows and they were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. On these findings, the Court of Appeal unanimously turned down Thongbai's appeal and hence confirmed the death penalty in his case.\n\n\n== Execution ==\nThongbai Naklangdon was hanged in Changi Prison at dawn on 30 August 1996. Thongbai, who was 28 years old at the time of his execution, was put to death alongside three other death row prisoners, who all also lost their appeals before they were executed. One of them was also from Thailand like Thongbai, a 24-year-old farmer named Jeerasak Densakul, who was convicted of smuggling 2.2 kg of marijuana in April 1995; the second was 36-year-old prostitute Teo Kim Hong, who was charged with stabbing her Malaysian colleague Ching Bee Ing to death in August 1995; and the third was 29-year-old hotel worker Zainal Abidin Abdul Malik, who was found guilty of murdering a police officer named Boo Tiang Huat in November 1994.\nThongbai was one of the ten people convicted of murder (also including British serial killer John Martin Scripps and the five construction site murderers from Thailand) to be hanged in the year 1996. Coupled with the executions of 40 drug traffickers (also including Malaysian drug traffickers Rozman Jusoh and Razali Mat Zin), a total of 50 death row convicts were executed in Singapore during the year of 1996 itself.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nIn the aftermath, the judgement of Thongbai's appeal, titled Thongbai Naklangdon v Public Prosecutor, was used as a case study by legal professionals in Singapore. In the appeal ruling itself, certain points were brought up in Thongbai's case, where the Court of Appeal ruled that motive was not a prerequisite of guilt, and any trial judge in whichever case is entitled to rely on inconsistent parts of the evidence that he/she found fit to do so and felt could be the truthful facts of the said case. Also, it was also clarified through the Thongbai case and other referred cases that even a retracted confession could also be used as evidence to convict an accused of whichever crime he was charged and tried for, should the court be satisfied that the retracted confession was the truth. The appeal case of Thongbai was referred to by certain court verdicts like the Mohamed Aliff Mohamed Yusoff case, the Nadasan Chandra Secharan case, and the Mohammed Ali Johari case.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCapital punishment in Singapore\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Joyce Debenham Seager MBE born Joyce Debenham Tearne known as Joy Seager (20 September 1899 – 7 September 1991) was a British-born physician, best known for being the only medical practitioner on Kangaroo Island, Australia from 1925. She wrote her biography and it became a TV mini-series.\n\n\n== Life ==\nSeager was born in England's Black Country, in Edgbaston, West Midlands. She was the last of three children born to Maude Mary (born Lee) and her husband Theodore Stephen Tearne. The family emigrated to Australia in 1907. Her father taught music and in 1909 he became the head of the New South Wales Department of Public Instruction music department. She went to Sydney Church of England Girls Grammar and Sydney Girls' High School. Seager went on to graduate in medicine in 1924 from the University of Sydney. She was briefly employed in hospitals but at the beginning of 1925 she became the only doctor, dentist and pharmacist on Kangaroo Island off the coast of South Australia.\nShe married a grazier who had been a Major and at Gallipoli in her first year. She had no vehicle or phone and journeys were made on horseback over dirt tracks. She established a temporary hospital and in 1930 a permanent one was built.\nIn May 1944 she took up a new position as (the only) doctor in Kingston and in the following year her husband had a new farm nearby. She handled an outbreak of diptheria and made early use of penicillin. In 1950 they made their final move to Mount Pleasant.\nIn 1965 she accompanied her husband as he travelled back with other veterans to Gallipoli after 50 years. On board, some of the occupants became ill and Seager cared for them, buying drugs and supplies. In 1966 she was awarded an MBE. Her first husband died in 1976 and in the following year she married Stanley Charles Henniker who was also a grazier.\nIn 1980 she published her biography as Kangaroo Island Doctor. The book was made into an Australian TV series, Shadows of the Heart, that was filmed on Kangaroo Island. The series was nominated in the Best Miniseries or Telefeature category in the 1991 Australian Film Institute Awards, and Josephine Byrnes was nominated for Best Lead Actress in a Television Drama.\nSeager died in Mount Pleasant in 1991.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiography at ADB",

        "content": "NGC 1253 is a spiral galaxy in the constellation Eridanus. The galaxy lies about 70 million light years away from Earth, which means, given its apparent dimensions, that NGC 1253 is approximately 110,000 light years across. It was discovered by William Herschel on September 20, 1784.NGC 1253 is categorised as having a having a bar, however its spiral arms are similar to that of Whirlpool Galaxy. The galaxy has two spiral arms, probably as a result of interaction with its satellite. The spiral arms end in what looks like a ring of hydrogen gas, while the inner area of the galaxy appears to be hydrogen poor. The velocity pattern indicates that the ring lies at the outer Lindblad resonance. The highest hydrogen density is observed at the northwest part of the ring. The largest HII regions of the galaxy lie along that ring. The supermassive black hole located in the centre of the galaxy is estimated to have a mass of 106.99 ± 0.53 (3 − 33 millions) M☉.NGC 1253 forms an interacting pair with NGC 1253A, a Magellanic spiral galaxy which lies 3.7 arcminutes away, which corresponds to a projected distance of 25 kiloparsecs. The two galaxies share a common hydrogen envelope. The hydrogen envelope has an extension at its eastern side to the north that could be a tidal tail. The two galaxies belong in the same galaxy cloud as Messier 77 and its group.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nNGC 1253 on WikiSky: DSS2, SDSS, GALEX, IRAS, Hydrogen α, X-Ray, Astrophoto, Sky Map, Articles and images",

        "content": "Styphelia psiloclada is a species of flowering plant in the heath family Ericaceae and is endemic to a small area of New South Wales. It is an erect to spreading shrub, usually with oblong leaves and light pink to dark crimson-pink flowers. It is only known from two National Parks on the South Coast.\n\n\n== Description ==\nStyphelia psiloclada is an erect to spreading shrub that typically grows to a height of 0.6–1.5 m (2 ft 0 in – 4 ft 11 in). Its leaves are bluish or greyish green, mostly oblong, 8.3–17.4 mm (0.33–0.69 in) and 3.9–7.5 mm (0.15–0.30 in) wide on a petiole up to 1 mm (0.039 in) long. The flowers are arranged singly, sometimes in pairs in upper leaf axils, with broadly egg-shaped bracts 1.0–1.9 mm (0.039–0.075 in) long and 1.5–2.1 mm (0.059–0.083 in) wide and bracteoles 2.6–3.2 mm (0.10–0.13 in) long and 2.3–3.4 mm (0.091–0.134 in) long at the base. The petals are light pink to dark crimson-pink, joined at the base to form a cylindrical tube 13.4–18.1 mm (0.53–0.71 in) long with lobes that are rolled backwards and hairy, 16.1–17.9 mm (0.63–0.70 in) long. The stamens are straight and extend beyond the end of the petal tube. Flowering occurs between January and March.\n\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\nStyphelia psiloclada was first formally described in 1992 by Jocelyn Powell in the journal Telopea from specimens collected in Wadbilliga National Park. The specific epithet (psiloclada) means \"bare\" or \"smooth\" branches, referring to the glabrous stems and branches.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThis species of Styphelia is only known from Wadbilliga and South East Forests National Parks, where it grows in forest on rocky ridges at altitudes between 900 and 1,130 m (2,950 and 3,710 ft).\n\n\n== References ==",

For example in a 2020 academic journal article, the Nigerian widow in Lonely Days is compared with the Zambian widow in  A Cowrie of Hope. The conclusion of the lengthy analysis states, \"Although the two novels are mere fiction, the two writers leave us with no doubt that thousands of widows still suffer in African communities because of the weight of customs and traditions.\"\n\n\n== Reference ==",

        "content": "The Humpty Doo Rice Project, also known as the Humpty Doo Rice Trail was a failed rice growing project in Humpty Doo, and surrounding areas, in the Northern Territory. The company that undertook this project was Territory Rice Limited and it was once billed as \"Australia's rice bowl\".  It is on the lands of the Limilngan and Wulna peoples.Parts of the former site of the Humpty Doo Rice Trail are now the Fogg Dam Conservation Reserve and the Harrison Dam Conservation Reserve.\n\n\n== History ==\nPlanning for the Humpty Doo Rice Project began in 1953 when Harold Holt, the then Minister for Labour and National Service, met with Allen Chase, an American entrepreneur at a party in Los Angeles. Holt told Chase about the Northern Territory's potential for growing rice and the success that Chinese farmers had in the 1800s and 1926 and encouraged him to invest. The Commonwealth Government, through Holt, wanted to further develop the population of North Australia, following World War II; it also knew that Asia would need rice to feed its growing population. Rice had already been grown successfully at the Ivanhoe Station in Kununurra, Western Australia, however as with other areas in Northern Australia the sustained agricultural production of rice failed.\nAfter this meeting Chase visited Humpty Doo, and the 300,000 hectares of sub-coastal plains that had been set aside for the project and was very impressed by them; he said \"[t]his is exactly like the Nile Valley, only it is twice as good!\". He then formed a syndicate of investors that included actors and entertainers Art Linkletter, Robert Cummings and Charles Correll.Together the syndicate began with a $40,000 survey of the area in 1954 and, in November 1955, incorporated as Territory Rice Limited and received the required agricultural leases which spanned from Adelaide River to Arnhem Land.Early development focused on the leases near Humpty Doo, on what was once Humpty Doo Station, which had previously been used for cattle. In order to begin the project they constructed roads, established a workers village, built a rice mills at Coolalinga and built an airfield. In exchange for their investment, the government built a power line from Darwin to the required sites and the Royal Australian Air Force's construction squadron built the Fogg Dam in 1956 and Harrison Dam in 1958. The government also provided additional capital, local administration and research into rice varieties and growing techniques.The dams and the associated irrigation systems they built were essential as the project faced constant issues with water as, in the tropical conditions of the Top End, there was often no rain in the dry season and too much during the wet season. One of the early investors, Art Linkletter, when reflecting on the project in 2000, said that he was told the area received 85 inches (215 cms) of rain each years but that:\nThe question I didn't know to ask was ‘How does the rain come down?’ And I found out it comes down in a week. Which took care of the rice. It went to sea.\nSignificant amounts of money were spent by both Territory Rice Limited and the government and, to save money, much of the infrastructure (including a 100 tonne bulk storage bin) were constructed using steel from Vestey's Meatworks and military equipment 'left over' after World War II.Despite this the project struggled financially from its earliest days and rice farming proved to be more difficult than expected. Facing financial pressures, and in an attempt to see whether the project was worthwhile, American businessman Robert McColloch took over management and invested nearly $2,000,000 over the next three years.Territory Rice Limited entered liquidation, with outstanding debts, in August 1960. Northern Territory politician Jock Nelson called it \"the greatest blunder and bungle perpetrated in 51 years of Commonwealth control over the NT\" and called for an inquiry into what he called the \"rice racket\". Nelson also compared the failures of the project and the high expenditure by the government to the earlier failure of the Batchelor Demonstration Farm which had closed in 1919.Following this liquidation local creditors and farmers formed Adelaide River Limited and Rice Development Proprietary Limited and took control of the assets and debts of the company and hoped to bring their practical experience to the project. These local investors did produce higher rice yields but ceased operations in 1964 due to slow payment for crops, limited government support and not wishing to borrow more money.The Humpty Doo Rice Project struggled due to a variety of factors and magpie geese are often listed as one of the major issues that the project faced after it was reported that when sowing seeds \"[w]ild geese, which swarm in the air, ate the lot\" and that an army unit deployed there to assist had to shoot specially made \"bomb guns\" to scare off the birds. While the geese where an issue many have stated that they were not as much as a concern as they were made out to be and that blaming them was primarily a publicity stunt.Despite its commercial failure the Humpty Doo Rice Project lead to significant population growth in the area due to the infrastructure put in place and the area it once leased is still farmed, in various capacities.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Guido Pagliuca (born 17 February 1976) is an Italian professional football manager and former defender, who is the manager of Serie C Group C club Juve Stabia.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter a modest playing career as a right back that was cut short by an injury, Pagliuca retired at the age of 28 to become a youth coach at amateur club Rosignano. He successively returned at hometown club Cecina, first as a youth coach and then in 2007 as a head coach, providing an attacking footballing style to a Serie D league team. In 2010 he left for Borgo a Buggiano, winning promotion to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione for the first time in the club's history. After that, he signed for fellow Lega Pro Seconda Divisione club Gavorrano, being however sacked in November 2011.\nFor the 2012–13 season, Pagliuca returned to Serie D to coach RapalloBogliasco before being sacked in January 2013. In the following season, he signed for fellow Serie D club Lucchese, guiding them to promotion to the 2014–15 Lega Pro after a last-minute win against rivals Correggese in the final game of the season. After being initially confirmed in charge of the club for the upcoming Lega Pro season, he was sacked in November 2014 due to poor results.\nIn October 2015, Pagliuca took over at Serie D club Imolese.\nAfter not being confirmed in charge of Imolese, in September 2016 he then signed for fellow Serie D club Real Forte Querceta; he was dismissed a year later, in September 2017, due to negative results at the beginning of the new season.\nIn July 2018, Pagliuca took over at Ghivizzano, another Tuscan Serie D club, before being replaced in March 2019.\nIn October 2019, Pagliuca joined Marco Baroni as part of his coaching staff at Serie B club Cremonese, leaving the club following Baroni's dismissal in January 2020.\nIn 2020, he returned to head coaching, this time at the Serie D club Pianese. In April 2021, Pianese announced to have parted ways with Pagliuca due to \"disciplinary reasons\".\nIn July 2021, Pagliuca returned to Lucchese, this time in Serie C, guiding the club to a spot in the promotion playoffs. On 29 June 2022, Pagliuca left Lucchese to sign for fellow Tuscan Serie C club Siena. After guiding Siena to an impressive season despite a number of financial issues that eventually led to the club's exclusion from professional football, Pagliuca was hired by Juve Stabia. On 8 April 2024, Juve Stabia mathematically won promotion to Serie B after being crowned Group C champions.\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\n\n=== Managerial ===\nBorgo a Buggiano\nSerie D: 2010–11 (Group D)\nLucchese\nSerie D: 2013–14 (Group D)\nJuve Stabia\nSerie C: 2023–24 (Group C)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Love in Constant Spectacle is the twelfth solo studio album by English musician Jane Weaver, released on 5 April 2024 through Fire Records. It received acclaim from critics.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nLove in Constant Spectacle received a score of 84 out of 100 on review aggregator Metacritic based on seven critics' reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Mojo found that \"Love in Constant Spectacle is watchful rather than showy, its songs not boxing up one simple mood at a time but sitting with their uncertainty. Nuance might be going out of fashion in the world outside, but in here, Weaver speaks it fluently\". Uncut's Piers Martin called it \"by some distance her most satisfying album\" as it is \"full of surprises and tantalisingly familiar\" and presents a \"head-spinning account of grief and solace\".\nFred Thomas of AllMusic described it as Weaver's \"most emotionally based set of songs to date\", stating that \"her most remarkable material drawing from Krautrock-styled repetition, Stereolab's blithe pop, Broadcast's eerily captivating melodic flare, and Goldfrapp-esque synth grooves\" and finding these to be present throughout the album. Exclaim!'s Eric Hill remarked that the album's \"focus is slightly more inward-facing, but Weaver still finds ways to create distance between intention and expression even when she herself is the topic\".\nReviewing the album for PopMatters, Peter Thomas Webb wrote that it \"retains many of the same textures, although the overall effect is a little gentler and more meditative than her previous album, Flock\". Janne Oinonen of The Line of Best Fit summarised that \"the songs often straddle propulsive organic grooves that coalesce perfectly with Weaver’s dreamy melodies and weightless vocals\". MusicOMH's John Murphy called Love in Constant Spectacle \"beautifully intricate, thoughtful songs [that] sit amid a hypnotic, otherworldly vibe that never settles for playing safe\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll tracks are written and arranged by Jane Weaver.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nMusicians\n\nJane Weaver – lead vocals (all tracks), synthesizer (tracks 1–3, 5–9), guitar (2, 6, 8, 9), keyboards (4, 7), handclaps (6), piano (8), drum machine (10)\nJoel Nicholson – guitar (all tracks), shakers, twelve-string guitar (track 2); synthesizer, handclaps (6)\nAndrew Cheetham – drums (tracks 1–3, 5–10), percussion (10)\nMatt Grayson – bass guitar (tracks 1, 2, 5–10)\nJohn Parish – tambourine (tracks 1, 2, 8), piano (5, 7), handclaps (6)\nJames Trevascus – drum programming (track 10)\nTechnical\n\nJane Weaver – production\nJohn Parish – production\nJason Mitchell – mastering\nJames Trevascus – engineering\nJoe Jones – engineering\nOliver Baldwin – engineering\nVisuals\n\nAndy Votel – artwork\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Demosthenes Ligdopoulos (Greek: Δημοσθένης Λιγδόπουλος; 1898–1920) was Greek socialist activist and newspaper editor who was a founding member of the Communist Party of Greece.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in Athens in 1898 in to a family of humble background, Ligdopoulos entered the University of Athens as a student of mathematics in 1916. In the same year, Ligdopoulos together with his fellow students and friends, founded the \"Socialist Youth of Athens\", which gathered many young people in its ranks, especially after the outbreak of the October Revolution. Ligdopoulos and many of his comrades were arrested by the Greek authorities for publishing left-wing literature but were released with a pardon given by the government of Eleftherios Venizelos because of international outcry.\nLigdopoulos and his comrades from the Socialist Youth of Athens played a leading role in the proceedings of the founding conference of the  Socialist Workers Party of Greece (SEKE), the predecessor of the Communist Party of Greece, which took take place in Piraeus in November 1918. Forming the left of the political trend of the conference together with Nikos Dimitratos, who will be elected secretary of the Central Committee of the SEKE.\nAt the first Session of the National Council of the SEKE (May 1919) a decision was taken to withdraw the party from the Second International and prepare the ground, so that it could join the Third International. The decision was the result of an intense confrontation between two wings. The left led by  Ligdopoulos, Dimitratos and M. Sideris who supported the integration into the Comintern and the opposition group of the right-wing faction of Avraam Benaroia and Aristoteli Sideris.\nIn January 1920, Ligdopoulos represented SEKE at the conference of the Balkan Communist and Socialist Parties in Sofia, where the Balkan Communist Federation was founded. He was then sent as a party representative to Moscow to participate in the 2nd Congress of the Comintern and to include the SEKE in its ranks. Ligdopoulos was chosen for this mission because he spoke French and was an ardent supporter of joining the Comintern.\nAfter the end of the conference, Ligdopoulos together with Alexakis at the end of October 1920 arriveed in Odessa and board a ship to return to Greece. They were murdered during the journey to the Black Sea by Turkish smugglers of Laz origin, and their bodies were dumped near the Bulgarian coast. There is no exact date of their death, although different ones have been written from time to time (October 21 or 25 or 27, 1920).\n\n\n== References ==",

It is India's first-ever military-grade geospatial satellite built entirely by the private sector.\n\nIn November 2023, TASL and Satellogic had inked a pact to develop and integrate an advanced earth observation satellite.\nOnce operational, TSAT-1A is expected to cater primarily to the government and armed forces, offering high-resolution military-grade imagery. According to media reports, although the primary customers will be the government and armed forces, the company will also target commercial customers. TASL intends to establish a constellation of similar satellites in the future, with its manufacturing facility primed to produce up to 25 low earth orbit (LEO) satellites annually.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "A Yard Too Far is the second episode  of the third season of The Ren & Stimpy Show that originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on 20 November 1993.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nRen and Stimpy are staving and homeless again. At the house of Mr. Pipe, Ren and Stimpy are attracted by the smell of hog jowls. To get the jowls, Ren and Stimpy first have to cross the backyard, where they are attacked by a vicious baboon. The baboon keeps the duo out of the backyard. Ren creates a \"sexy\" baboon puppet to distract the baboon. The baboon falls in love with the puppet and proposes marriage to it, which the puppet master Ren is forced to accept. Stimpy plays a minister and marries the baboon to the puppet, which still has Ren's hand struck in it. The baboon goes off to consummate his marriage while Ren and Stimpy eat the jowls.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of Billy West\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nMr. Pipe-voice of Billy West\nThe baboon-voice of Bob Camp]\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe script for A Yard Too Far was written by John Kricfalusi and was intended for the second season. Kricfalusi had planed to direct A Yard Too Far as an exercise in educating his employees at the Spümcø studio about story structure. Kricfaulsi based his story on the 1958 Yogi Bear story Pie Pirates. When the Spümcø studio lost the contract for The Ren & Stimpy Show on 21 September 1992, A Yard Too Far was reassigned by the network to the Games Animation studio. The delivery of stories for the second season was so haphazard and late that A Yard Too Far was held over for the third season. A Yard Too Far was directed by Bob Camp who decided to play the story for laughs and displayed a \"sense of self-restraint\" that kept the \"more repulsive moments appropriately nonchalant\". After Kricfalusi complained about being uncredited, on the second airing of A Yard Too Far on 12 March 1994 the credit \"Written by John Kricfalusi\" was added.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe American journalist Thad Komorowski gave A Yard Too Far three stars out of five,\n\n\n== Books and articles ==\nDobbs, G. Michael (2015). Escape – How Animation Broke into the Mainstream in the 1990s. Orlando: BearManor Media. ISBN 1593931107.\nKomorowski, Thad (2017).

        "content": "The Povcha Upland (Повчанська височина in Ukrainian) is a hill range in Ukraine, forming part of the Volhynian Upland.The Povcha Upland is situated in western Ukraine, between the valleys of the Styr and the Ikva, surrounding and taking its name from the village of Povcha (Ukrainian: Повча; former Polish name: Pełcza), about 105 km from the Polish-Ukrainian border. Its highest peak is at 361 m a.s.l. (358 m according to other sources) compared to the mean maximum altitude of the surrounding plain being about 270–280 m; this is the highest point of the Volhynian Upland.The Povcha Upland is also called a 'range' (Polish: Pasmo Pełczańskie) or even (in older sources) 'mountains' (Polish: Góry Pełczańskie). Sometimes it is treated as the Povcha-Mizoch Range (Polish: Pasmo Pełczańsko-Mizockie) together with its eastern continuation, the Mizoch Range; however, on account of differences in geology and geomorphology, the Povcha Upland and the Mizoch Range are better treated as separate physiographic units. The western continuation of the Povcha Upland is the Sokal Plateau-ridge (Ukrainian: Сокальське пасмо; Polish: Grzęda Sokalska) situated partly in Ukraine and partly in Poland.Natural vegetation of the Povcha Upland consists or consisted of deciduous and mixed forests, with small patches of steppe vegetation on southern slopes of the hills.In the Povcha Upland there are (or used to be) a few outcrops of Devonian rocks. Their scientific importance is due to the fact that these are the only outcrops of this system in an area otherwise devoid of any (namely between the Holy Cross Mountains to the west and the Dniester valley to the east). Middle Devonian fossil fauna, including brachiopods, corals, and conodonts, is known from the environs of Povcha.\n\n\n== Notes ==",

        "content": "To Salve and Salve Not! is the first episode  of the third season of The Ren & Stimpy Show that originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on 20 November 1993.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe Salesman  keeps pushing Stimpy to buy his useless products while Stimpy has no sales resistance. After Stimpy spends a fortune on the Titan 4000 Vacuum Cleaner, Ren becomes angry and tries to stop Stimpy from spending all of his money on the products offered by the Salesman. The Salesman returns at the door to try to sell Stimpy a product called Salve, which Ren stops him from buying. Ren keeps chasing away the Salesman who keeps returning, going so far as to disguise himself as a piece of bread. Ren uses the toilet and discovers that he is out of toilet paper. The Salesman appears and offers to sell Salve, which he assures is an effective substitute for toilet paper. Ren agrees to buy Salve, but finds that Stimpy has already purchased all of the Salve, which he is willing to share with Ren.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of Billy West\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nThe Salesman-voice of Billy West\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe script for To Salve and Salve Not! was written in late 1991 and it was intended that the episode would be part of the second season. The script had been approved by the network, and when the Spümcø studio lost the contract for The Ren & Stimpy Show on 21 September 1992, To Salve and Salve Not! was assigned to the new Games Animation studio. Production on the second season was so erratic and late that To Salve and Salve Not! was held over for the third season. During the Spümcø era, there were two types of stories, the \"psychodramas\" where one of the character would be put through an emotionally wrenching experience, and the \"gag reels\", which were a just collection of gags built loosely around a thin plot.  In January 1993, the network forbade any more \"psychodramas\", and henceforward there would be only \"gag reel\" stories.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe American journalist Thad Komorowski praised the work of Bob Camp as the director, whose \"conscious sense of self-restraint\" kept the more grotesque elements of the plot at bay..    \n\n\n== Books and articles ==\nDobbs, G. Michael (2015). Escape – How Animation Broke into the Mainstream in the 1990s. Orlando: BearManor Media. ISBN 1593931107.\nKomorowski, Thad (2017).

        "content": "\"Somewhere Near Marseilles\" (sometimes written as \"Somewhere Near Marseilles -マルセイユ辺り-\") is a song by Japanese-American singer Hikaru Utada. It appeared as the closing song to the standard version of Utada's eleventh studio album Bad Mode (2022), and a live recording of the song was released as a single on September 16, 2022. On April 3, 2024, Epic Records Japan released the \"Sci-Fi Edit\" version as the third single from Utada's first greatest hits album, Science Fiction (2024). The song was written entirely by Utada and arranged and produced by Utada and Sam Shepherd.\n\"Somewhere Near Marseille\" is a 12-minute house track that incorporates elements of acid house, disco, and Balearic house, as well as ambient noises, synthesisers, and electronic instruments. The Sci-Fi edit is approximately four minutes long and retains many of the original composition elements. Lyrically, the song discusses a long-distance relationship and travelling from London and Paris to Marseille for a rendezvous. The original version was chosen as the commercial theme song for the Japanese distribution of jewellery company Cartier.\n\"Somewhere Near Marseille\" received critical acclaim from music critics, with many citing it as a standout from the parent album. Furthermore, many critics praised the song's composition, production quality, Utada's vocals, and length, with some publications including the track on their year-end lists. Yuichi Kodama directed two music videos for the song, the live recorded version and the Sci-Fi edit, both of which were shot at the Yokohama Hakkeijima Sea Paradise, with the latter featuring re-edited footage from the original.\n\n\n== Background and development ==\nThroughout 2020 and 2021, Utada began working on music for their eleventh studio album, Bad Mode (2022). Throughout the process, Utada released a number of singles and commercial theme songs in Japan to promote the album, confirming that it would be their first bilingual release. Bad Mode was released in various territories on January 19, 2022, and included the song \"Somewhere Near Marseilles\", which served as the album's standard closing track. Utada wrote \"Somewhere Near Marseilles\", and assisted Sam Shepherd in composing and producing it. Utada's vocals were recorded at ABS Recordings and edited by Yuya Saito. The final recording was mixed by Steve Fitzmaurice at Pierce Room and mastered at Sterling Sound Studios in Edgewater, New Jersey.\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\"Somewhere Near Marseille\" is a 12-minute house track that incorporates various musical notes and influences. The song's lyrics describe a long-distance relationship between Utada in London and their lover in Paris. Throughout the lyrics, Utada suggests a \"rendezvous vacay\" for the lover to Marseilles, as mentioned in the song title. Andrew Ryce from Resident Advisor described it as a \"smouldering torch song sung to a distant lover,\" noting that the lyrics are in both English and Japanese. In terms of production, Ryce explained that Utada's \"vocal production sits so perfectly on Floating Points' gentle rhythms that once Utada begins to fade into the track for its extended outro, you barely notice.\"\nMusically, Playy. magazine called it a \"near twelve-minute acid house deep dive,\" emphasising the song's use of synths and ambient noise. Lars Gotrich from NPR Music described it as a \"hypnotic disco train\" with \"soft-panning bongos, 808 kick drums, and funky synths glide\". Pitchfork editor Joshua Minsoo Kim called it a \"lively Balearic house epic with acid squelches, hand percussion, and an irresistible depiction of romance.\" Peter Piatkowski of PopMatters described the song as \"muted house beat and subtle electronic flourishes that frame Utada's sweet croon.\" Ryce described the overall beat as \"laid-back\" and heard elements of acid house in the sound.\nUtada wrote many tracks from Bad Mode during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and stated that the majority of the songs reflected their personality, such as motherhood, personal struggles, and improving relationships with others. Billboard expressed similar feelings about its pandemic influence, describing it as a \"club-like tune that deftly evokes the precarious emotional states people have been thrust into by the pandemic.\" Tsuya-Chan of Tokion first questioned the song's title, pointing out Utada's use of London and Paris in the lyrics, with the former being Utada's home. Tsuya went on to investigate whether the word \"Marseille\" in the lyrics could be used as a \"series of sounds\" for both English and Japanese delivery.\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\n\nEpic and Universal Music Japan first released \"Somewhere Near Marseille\" on January 19, 2022, as part of Bad Mode. In July, the song served as the commercial theme song for Cartier in Japan. Yuichi Kodama directed a special campaign film starring Utada, which included a behind-the-scenes video. Kodama also directed a live music video at Yokohama Hakkeijima Sea Paradise, in which Utada performs the song while various audience members dance and walk around an aquarium. The visual was released in two formats: vertical angle and panorama, and premiered exclusively to Spotify in part of their five-year anniversary celebration of the service launching in Japan. On September 16, the same live recorded version became available for video streaming.\nUtada announced their first greatest hits album, Science Fiction (2022), in January 2024, which features a mix of reworked and original singles from Utada's music discography, and is to commemorate the singer's 25th career anniversary. The Sci-Fi edit of \"Somewhere Near Marseille\" was added to the album's track list and serves as the final song on the second disc. It was later confirmed to be the album's third single and was made available digitally on April 3. Similar versions of the vertical and panorama videos were distributed on Utada's YouTube channel featuring the Sci-Fi edit.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nMusic critics lauded \"Somewhere Near Marseille\". Peter Piatkowski of PopMatters praised Utada's collaboration with Shepherd, calling the song \"excellent\". Andrew Ryce of Resident Advisor praised Utada's collaboration with Shepherd, complimenting Utada's vocal delivery and the song's sound. Ryce went on to describe it as follows: \"It's not quite a dance floor album—it's too subtle and stately for that—but it's somewhere wonderfully in-between, an amorous ballad you can tap your foot to, a track that channels the frenetic energy of acid house something a little more relaxed...\". Similarly, Lars Gotrich of NPR compared it to Shepherd's collaboration with Pharoah Sanders on his album Promises (2021), writing \"even when we depart or disintegrate their transcendent voice, it's implied in the production's undulating shape, still shimmering in awe of Hikaru Utada's presence.\"\nJoshua Minsoo Kim of Pitchfork noted the song's lyricism and overall themes, writing, \"Inspiration can't help but strike in a locale this rich in beauty, so across 12 minutes, Utada conjures up a similarly expansive space overflowing with possibility.\" Playy. magazine described it as a \"feat of a track\" and praised its \"audacious\" blend of house and pop music, writing that \"Somewhere Near Marseilles\" is \"near house-pop perfection. Floating Points crafts an effortlessly laidback landscape for Utada’s voice to make her discotheque, and she practically melts into the scenery like butter.\" Sputnikmusic gave it a positive review, praising Utada's work on the song, but criticised Shepherd's lack of innovation given how long the song is.\nBy the end of 2022, \"Somewhere Near Marseille\" had made several year-end lists and received reviews from various publications. Pitchfork editor Eric Torres described \"Somewhere Near Marseilles\" as a \"jet-setting, showstopping finale frames a Mediterranean tryst in finger snaps and rubbery synths\" and concluded \"Somewhere Near Marseilles\" \"makes falling hard and fast sound like its own euphoric form of escape.\" Ryce from Resident Advisor stated that the song \"unfolds over 11 minutes of exquisitely produced house, bobbing and glimmering in all the right places.\" Slant Magazine writer Paul Attard described the song as \"groovy\" and \"globe-trotting,\" while Jordan Danville from The Fader praised its sound, writing \"all-encompassing delirium is the music of Utada's heart...\".\n\n\n=== Year-end lists ===\n\n\n== Formats and track listing ==\nAlbum version\n\n\"Somewhere Near Marseilles\" – 11:55\nSci-Fi edit\n\n\"Somewhere Near Marseilles\" (Sci-Fi edit) – 4:13\n\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of Bad Mode.\nLocations\n\nRecorded at ABS Studios in Tokyo; mixed at Pierce Room; mastered at Sterling Sound Studios in Edgewater, New Jersey.\nPersonnel\n\nHikaru Utada – arranger, composer, keyboards, instrumentation, producer, programming, songwriter, vocals, background vocals,\nSam Shepherd – arranger, composer, keyboards, producer, programming\nYuya Saito – vocal editing\nSteve Fitzmaurice – recording\nWill Fry – percussion\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Botany Manor is a 2024 video game developed by English independent developer Balloon Studios and published by Whitethorn Games. The game is a puzzle title in which players explore a period English countryside manor to cultivate magical flora. Upon release, Botany Manor received generally positive reviews, with critics praising the game's environmental design, tone and pacing.  \n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nSet in 1890, players assume the role of Arabella Greene, a retired botanist and inheritor of a Somerset manor who is undertaking research on plants in preparation of publishing a book about the world's 'Forgotten Flora'. Players complete point-and-click puzzles across several chapters by growing one or more plants, in turn completing sections of Greene's book. Plants in the game have magical qualities that respond to certain behaviors, such as light or temperature, with the player changing these environmental conditions to allow the plants to bloom. Clues on how to grow plants are dispersed throughout the areas of the manor in each stage and collected in a notebook. When a plant successfully blooms, the notebook will reveal an illustration and more details, and unlock progression to the next stage, often where a key to a new room of the manor is delivered.\n\n\n== Development ==\nBotany Manor was developed by Balloon Studios, a Devon-based team founded by Laure De Mey, who had previously worked with Ustwo Games, the developers of Monument Valley. De Mey stated that the inspiration of the game was to explore a setting for a manor, with the house of naturalist Charles Darwin, Down House and the fictitious manor of Lara Croft in the Tomb Raider series serving as inspiration for the design. The late nineteenth century was pursued as a setting to capture the \"era of great scientific discovery\", and provide a \"feasible\" premise for creating a puzzle game about fantastical botany. Development of the game pursued a \"clear and straightforward\" approach to puzzle design and difficulty with the stated aim of designing a \"nice peaceful setting\" and gameplay that struck a balance between being \"not too challenging, but obviously not too simple\" to minimise \"strain on the player\". Balloon Studios announced the game at a Nintendo Indie World event for the Switch in November 2022, and was published on its announced released date of 9 February 2024 for the Xbox Series, Xbox One, Switch and PC via Steam.\nThe game was localized into German, French, Italian, Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese by the localization collective Warlocs.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nAccording to review aggregator Metacritic, Botany Manor received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics. Reviewers praised the game's execution of its botanic theme and environmental design, with comparisons to botanical games such as Strange Horticulture, or games set in open environments such as The Witness. Larryn Bell of Shacknews described the game's themes as highlighting the \"overall interconnectedness of nature\" and influence of environment on wellbeing, although expressed that plants could have had more utility in the game. Alice Bell of Rock Paper Shotgun commended the game's design of a \"bright\" and \"bouncy\" world, writing that \"the developers have clearly taken pains to make it a nice place to be\". Digitally Downloaded similarly praised the game's \"beautfully crafted\" world, finding the music and sound to \"work harmoniously with the game's visuals\". Saniya Ahmed of IGN described the scenery as \"picturesque\" and \"quaint\", finding the environmental details of the game's various \"pamphlets, bottle labels, (and) advertisements\" as conveying a \"vintage charm\", although finding the manor's space to feel empty. \nMany critics remarked on the game's sedate and relaxing pacing. Kate Gray of Nintendo Life characterised the game as part of a genre of \"cozy and wholesome\" titles focused on \"cultivation and creation\" in opposition to those of \"violence and conflict\" predicated in most genres. Larryn Bell of Shacknews noted the game was \"wholesome\" and \"laid-back\" and allowed players to complete it at their own pace. Digitally Downloaded praised the game as \"cozy\", citing the lack of time limits and the game's ability to \"gently prod you in the right direction\". \nThe game's narrative was mostly praised by reviewers. Larryn Bell of Shacknews considered the \"nuanced storytelling\" through letters, notes and objects to tell a \"thoughtful\" and \"poignant tale\" about overcoming adversity and discrimination in the context of the late nineteenth century. Alice Bell of Rock Paper Shotgun similarly noted the existence of a subtle narrative \"that suggests a full but frustrating life\" but made the conclusion more satisfying for those players paying attention. However, Saniya Ahmed of IGN considered the personal story of the protagonist to be \"one-note\" and \"trail behind\" due to its reliance on notes, writing that these \"fail to dig deep into her emotions\". \nSome critics observed bugs and quality of life issues. Kate Gray of Nintendo Life considered the game may have benefited from the ability to document clues more thoroughly and clearer location of the player on a map of the mansion. Similarly, Digitally Downloaded noted the need for players to \"tediously run all over the place\" to reference clues absent these features. Kieron Verbrugge of Press Start experienced \"visual bugs\" and \"glitched achievements\" throughout gameplay, although noted these were \"small issues\" that had \"little impact on the actual game. However, Digitally Downloaded praised the game for its accessibility features.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Aponogeton satarensis is a species of aquatic herb in the family Aponogetonaceae endemic to the northern Western Ghats (Maharashtra) of India. It is sometimes commonly known as the Satara lace plant. In Marathi it is known as \"y-tura\" (वायतुरा). Another common name is Satara aponogeton.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nAponogeton satarensis is a scapigerous, tuberous herb. It is an annual aquatic plant, typically reaching heights of 10–25 cm. It is dioecious, with root tubers that are globose or ellipsoid, measuring 14–16 mm across. The plant features dioecious spikes, forked and purple in color. Male inflorescences are 5–7 cm long with purple tepals that fade to rose or pale white. Stamens are typically 5-6 and measure 2 mm in length. Female inflorescences are shorter, ranging from 2.5 to 3.5 cm, with purple carpels containing 2 ovules per carpel. Fruiting peduncles can grow up to 12 cm long, bearing 1-2 seeds.\n\n\n== Range ==\nAponogeton satarensis is endemic and native to India. It has been observed in various locations including Mhavashi (the type locality), Kas, Patan ferricretes in Satara district, and Gothane ferricrete in the Western Ghats, which is part of Ratnagiri district. Additionally, it's also been recorded at the Chalkewadi plateau in Satara district, Maharashtra, and is known to inhabit the Amboli area in Maharashtra as well.\n\n\n== Habitat and ecology ==\n\nAponogeton satarensis is typically found in temporary ponds and puddles alongside other hydrophytes such as Eriocaulon, Rotala, Myriophyllum, and Pogostemon. It flowers and fruits between June and August with its inflorescence emerging above the water. It closely resembles A. decaryi Jumelle but differs in several aspects, including similar sexes, longer and narrower lamina, purple tepals, longer fruiting inflorescence, and larger fruits.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nIt is named after Satara district, Maharashtra, where the species is found abundantly.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The car wall is a pile of burnt cars west of the Tkuma in the Gaza envelope, resembling the shape of a wall. Originally, this pile was created by evacuating the burnt cars from Route 232 and other places in the Gaza envelope after the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, in general, and the massacre at the Nova Festival in particular, from where most of the cars came. Later, the wall of burnt cars became a memorial to the massacre that took place at the festival, which was the largest terrorist attack in the history of the State of Israel.\nNext to the wall of burnt cars, there are hundreds of other cars that are out of use, and they too are displayed as a memorial to the massacres committed against their owners.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn the morning of October 7, 2023, the Hamas organizations and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad launched a surprise attack on Israel. Under the cover of launching thousands of rockets, about 3,500 militant from the Gaza Strip infiltrated dozens of Israeli settlements and military facilities in the Gaza envelope area and its surroundings, conducting shooting battles against a few security forces. The militant committed acts of massacre and rape, murdering and killing 1,150 people, including the massacre of 779 civilians, and abducted about 253 people to the Gaza Strip, including women, the elderly, and infants. In the first hours, they fought against the readiness squads, Israeli police officers, Yamam fighters, and IDF soldiers while being numerically inferior. In the battles, about 1,550 militants were killed on Israeli territory, and on the Israeli side, 301 soldiers, 55 police officers, and 10 General Security Service personnel were killed.\n\n\n== The Memorial ==\n\nAfter the massacre at the Nova Festival, which left hundreds of burnt and damaged cars scattered along the sides of Route 232, the cars were evacuated to a car lot located west of the Tkuma settlement and northwest of Netivot, in order to clear Route 232 and to concentrate the cars of the victims for the process of locating and identifying the remains of the bodies. A total of 860 vehicles were evacuated there from the Gaza envelope area, most of them from the Nova Festival. Out of all the vehicles that arrived at the lot, only 62 received approval from the examiners to return to the road, while the rest were marked as having severe safety defects, due to the fact that the militant shot at the engines of the vehicles in order to disable them, and then shot the occupants to death.\nNext to the cars, there is also a pile of motorcycles on which the militants rode.\nIn November 2023, archaeologists arrived at the lot with the aim of finding items from the victims inside the burnt vehicles. Members of ZAKA also arrived at the location in order to find items that could lead to a proper burial in Israel.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nShocking evidence of the massacre: behind the burnt car lot from October 7",

As a member of the Portuguese Socialist Party (PS), she was elected as a deputy in the Portuguese Assembly of the Republic in January 2022, representing Braga, and was re-elected in 2024.\n\n\n== Career ==\nCosta was born on 8 March 1972. She comes from Vizela in the north of Portugal and is married to Jose Carlos Pinto da Costa. She has a degree in social work and from 2004 to 2022 worked for the northern regional health service of Portugal. In 2020 she was elected unanimously as president of the Lions Club of Vizela.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nIn 2017 Costa became a deputy in the Vizela municipal assembly, initially as a supporter of the Vizela Sempre (Always Vizela) movement. In her second term in this role she was elected as a member of the Socialist Party (PS). In the 2022 national election when the PS, under the prime minister António Costa, won an overall majority, she was eleventh on the PS list of candidates for the Braga constituency. The PS won nine seats in the constituency but she joined the national assembly when the head of the list, José Luís Carneiro, was appointed as Minister of Internal Administration and another successful candidate, Elisabete Matos, requested a delay in taking up her duties to enable her to complete her contract as artistic director of the Teatro Nacional de São Carlos in Lisbon. In the 2024 election Costa was fifth on the PS list and was elected when the PS won six of the 19 seats in the constituency.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Frank Raymond Van Hoven (February 5, 1886 – January 11, 1929) was an American stage magician and comic entertainer.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nVan Hoven was born in Sioux City, Iowa; his father was a Dutch immigrant.  He worked in fairgrounds and attempted to become a juggler before being persuaded by Dante the Magician to try his hand at stage magic.   He was an assistant to his uncle, illusionist Paul Kleist, before going solo in shows run by Gus Sun in the Midwest.  He was not immediately successful and was fired by Sun, but moved to New York.  There, he started to develop an act, inspired by English conjurer William J. Hiller, based around his tricks going wrong, occasioning great audience hilarity.    \n\nAs reported by the Indianapolis Times in 1921:Van Hoven bills himself as the “Dippy Mad Magician.” He is more than that—he is the comedy Jester divine of the stage. He works like a whirlwind and he reaps as many laughs as the weatherman puts snowflakes in a 100 per cent blizzard. Van Hoven rushes In on the stage, talking to himself, pulling this would-be trlck, exposing the other trick, forgetting his \"props,\" then rushing through the house to find a \"boy\" and then trotting back with the most \"nonambitious trio\" of boys I have ever seen. Then follows the funniest mixup of boys. Ice, man, a woman's handkerchief, stage property and everything else I have ever seen. Van Hoven, in my humble judgment, Is the funniest man on the stage. He is \"wild,\" and his fun is even more wild.\nHe became known as \"The Man Who Made Ice Famous\" because of an act in which two stooges would be asked to hold large blocks of ice, while Van Hoven would ponder what to do with them, leave the stage only to return with a glass of beer, and then try but fail to perform a trick to make a handkerchief appear inside the ice.  His antics left audiences highly amused and he became well-known, touring widely in both the U.S. and in British music halls in the 1920s.\nHe died from pneumonia at the age of 42, in Birmingham, England, while touring there in 1929.  Those receiving news of his death reportedly thought it was another of his practical jokes.  After his death, some of his props and act were taken on by fellow performer Dell O'Dell.\n\n\n== References ==",

Since 1928 it has stood at the junction of Archerfield Road and Booker Avenue. Prior to this, it originally stood 60 metres away in a field then named The Stone Hey, but was moved due to a housing development.\nRobin Hood's Stone is rectangular and measures about 2 metres high by 0.9 metres wide by 0.4 metres thick. It features cup marks similar to those at the Calderstones.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nRon Cowell: The Calderstones. A Prehistoric Tomb in Liverpool.

        "content": "Albert Fuchs (born 6 August 1858 in Basel; died 15 February 1910 in Dresden; full name: Leonhard Johann Heinrich Albert Fuchs) was a Swiss-German composer, conductor, music educator, and music critic, as well as a collector of historical musical instruments.\n\n\n== Life and work ==\nFuchs was the son of a master bookbinder born in 1806, working in Basel, whose father came from Mannheim, where he was a tobacco manufacturer. Fuchs' mother was born in 1834. Albert Fuchs attended gymnasium in Basel. Even at this time, he received musical training, which he deepened from 1876 to 1879 in Leipzig at the Conservatorium of Music. His final polish was given by the music theorist Salomon Jadassohn and the composer and pianist Carl Reinecke, completing their training with distinction. Reinecke was at that time the director of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra.\nHis first position Fuchs received in 1880 in Trier, which belonged to the Prussian Rhineland, where he conducted oratorio performances and orchestra concerts as a music director.\nJust three years later, he retired to Saxony. In Oberlößnitz outside the gates of the residence city Dresden, he acquired a vineyard for a few years (today known as Haus Steinbach), on which he \"realized his compositional plans\".\nAt the end of the 1880s, Fuchs acquired the Conservatory originally founded by Wilhelm Freudenberg and bankrupt under Otto Taubmann in Wiesbaden and moved from the Saxon Nice on the Elbe to the Nice of the North on the Main. Wiesbaden, soon called the Imperial City, developed at that time following the imperial spa visits into the city with the most millionaire families in Germany. There, he led his own conservatory between 1889 and 1898, \"whose reputation he reaffirmed as a universal music educator together with H. Riemann.\" Riemann joined him in 1890 from the princely conservatory in Sondershausen for the next five years, bringing his student Max Reger with him. With Reger at the harpsichord, Fuchs regularly gave house concerts, in which he tested specimens of his historical instruments, which found their way into his begun Collection of Historical Instruments.\nWith the call to the Royal Conservatory in Dresden in 1898, Fuchs returned to the Elbe. He was appointed there as a teacher for theory and singing and was honored with the title of Royal Professor in 1908. During this Dresden period, Fuchs composed his main works, his oratorios, which he premiered as conductor of the Robert Schumann Singakademie. Furthermore, Fuchs acted as a music critic, writing \"highly regarded\" reviews for the Dresdener Zeitung.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nFuchs's compositional work, including sacred and secular choral works as well as songs and oratorios, has fallen into oblivion today. However, his achievements in the research of historical musical instruments remain. Through the use of specimens acquired for his collection in concerts, he significantly promoted the revival of so-called Early Music from the periods before about 1750.\n\n\n== Honors ==\nFuchs was awarded the title \"Professor\" in 1908. In Dresden, Fuchsstraße is named after him.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n=== Compositions ===\nBlessed are those who die in the Lord. 1906.\nThe Millennial Kingdom. 1908.\nNirvana.

The film was released by Pathé Exchange in July 1918, but had a pre-release screening at New York's Rivoli Theatre in May of that same year.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAs described in film magazines,  wealthy steel-mill owner, Lemuel Deering (Keenan), welcomes his son Harvey (Gilbert) back from college. Not long after Harvey arrives home, bills begin rolling in for all sorts of vices: alcohol, pool, cigars, etc. Thinking his son an upstanding  young citizen, Lemuel is appalled and Harvey denies that he had anything to do with the bills. Eventually, a bill comes in for $25,000. Lemuel refuses to pay and the bank forecloses on his mill.\nHarold, Harvey's friend from college, shows up and admits that he has been forging Harvey's signature because his own father has cut him off. Harold had trusted that Harvey would not turn him in out of loyalty as a fraternity brother.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nFrank Keenan as Lemuel Deering\nJohn Gilbert as Harvey Deering\nIda Lewis as Mrs. Deering\nRoberta Wilson as Miriam Deering\nJoseph J.

        "content": "Tristan Woodfine (born 18 June 1993) is a Canadian long-distance runner who holds a marathon personal best of 2:10:39, set at the 2024 Houston Marathon.\n\n\n== Athletics career ==\nWoodfine began his sporting career as a triathlete at the age of 14. He represented Canada at the 2011 World Junior Championships in Beijing, finishing in 22nd.\nFrom 2013 to 2015, Woodfine competed for the Guelph Gryphons cross country and track and field teams. In fall 2013, he placed second behind Aaron Hendrix at the CIS Cross Country Championships in London. In March 2014, he represented Canada at the World University Cross Country Championships in Entebbe, Uganda, placing seventh as the top Canadian. In 2014, he once again place second at the CIS Cross Country Championships, this time behind Ross Proudfoot. \n\n\n=== Marathoning ===\nOn April 12, 2015, Woodfine made his marathon debut in Rotterdam, running a time of 2:27:55. He wouldn't run another marathon until May 2018 at the Ottawa Marathon. There he would finish 10th as the top Canadian in a personal best of 2:18:55.\nIn January 2019, he ran a three-and-a-half minute personal best at the Houston Marathon, placing 10th in 2:15:19. In June, he won the Canadian Half Marathon Championships in Winnipeg, finishing in a personal best of 1:04:46. In October, he competed at the Canadian Olympic Marathon Trials held at the Toronto Waterfront Marathon. He would finish as 11th overall and as the second Canadian in 2:13:16, only behind Trevor Hofbauer and in front of Canadian record holder Cam Levins.\n\n\n==== Appeal of Olympic Marathon Selection ====\nCompeting at the elite-only 2020 London Marathon, held on October 4, Woodfine ran a lifetime best of 2:10:51, running under the Tokyo Olympic qualifying standard of 2:11:30. Despite hitting the standard, Woodfine would not be selected by Athletics Canada (AC) to represent Canada at the 2020 Olympics, left off the team in favour of Trevor Hofbauer, Cam Levins, and Ben Preisner. Just four days after decision AC's marathon team announcement on June 4, 2021, Woodfine would file an appeal to have AC reconsider the decision. He claimed that \"AC's decision was based on incomplete information, contradictory reasoning and use of results outside of the qualifying window and at non-marathon events\".  He also claimed that selectors were biased in favour of Levins due to his close contact with AC giving him more opportunity to explain away poor performances. Despite Woodfine's allegations, AC Commissioner Frank Fowlie rejected his appeal, confirming AC's previous decisions. This left Woodfine off the team as the alternate. \nAfter a series of disappointing marathons, a 2:23:35 at London 2021 and a 2:21:55 at Ottawa 2022, Preisner returned to form in November 2023 with a half marathon personal best of 1:02:40 to take sixth at the B.A.A. Half Marathon. Two months later in January 2024, he contested the Houston Marathon, running a personal best of 2:10:39.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2021 Social Democratic Party of Lithuania leadership election took place on 3–9 May 2021 to elect the chairperson of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania. It was the third direct leadership election in the party's history.\nThe party's previous chairman, Gintautas Paluckas, resigned on 22 January 2021, after the party's defeat in the 2020 parliamentary election. Member of the European Parliament Vilija Blinkevičiūtė was elected as the party's chairwoman with 56 percent of the vote and became the party's first female leader in its history.\n\n\n== Procedure ==\nAccording to the party statute, the chairperson of the Social Democratic Party is responsible for the party's organization, formulates tasks for the party's branches, leads the party's council and presidium, proposes the party's candidates to the Government of Lithuania and other political posts to the presidium, and, finally, is the face of the party and is expected to be the party's candidate to the office of Prime Minister of Lithuania. They are elected for a two-year term, and can be reelected.\nUntil 2017, the chairperson was elected by a party convention. The first direct chairperson election was held in 2017 and was won by Gintautas Paluckas, defeating Mindaugas Sinkevičius with 51.77% of the vote. The party did not want to be left behind by the Homeland Union and Liberal Movement, both of whom had already held direct party leader elections, and it was lauded by the party's membership as a move towards internal democracy.\n\n\n== Candidates ==\nFour candidates participated in the leadership election, although two withdrew from the race.\n\nVilija Blinkevičiūtė, Minister of Social Security and Labour from 2000 to 2008, Member of the Seimas from 2004 to 2009, Member of the European Parliament since 2009;\nJuozas Olekas, Minister of National Defence from 2008 to 2008 and again from 2012 to 2016, Member of the European Parliament since 2019.\nBlinkevičiūtė's election program, \"All Our Hearts - To the Left\" (Lithuanian: Visų mūsų širdys - kairėje!), raised three goals of her leadership - to strengthen the pride and loyalty of social democracy and refuse to \"give up their position to pretenders\"; to win the 2023 municipal elections; and to pursue social justice and equal opportunities.\nOlekas's election manifesto also focused on making gains in the 2023 municipal elections, but also reform to the party's structure to allow local party branches to formulate tasks for the party centre. According to his manifesto, the party must stand for the weak and self-employed, and its main principles are solidarity, sustainable development, equality and justice. He vowed to stay as chairman for one term and then hand over the reins of the party to younger leaders.\nThe elections were also contested by:\n\nLiutauras Gudžinskas, professor (endorsed Blinkevičiūtė)\nVitalijus Mitrofanovas, mayor of Akmenė District Municipality since 2008 (endorsed Olekas)\nGudžinskas represented the progressive wing of the party. His program vowed to expand the internal democracy of the party by allowing all members of the party to rank candidates to the Seimas, the European Parliament and in local elections, establishing internal party referendums, and the inclusion of more progressive tenets in the party's program, such as economic democracy and further labour rights. Mitrofanovas published a short program, where he stated that the party must represent the interests of working people, seniors and families, that the party has veered too far to the right and lost the trust of the people, and the party should follow \"the fundamental goals of the Social Democrats, such as social welfare for everyone, the rule of law, transparency and pluralism of opinions, respect and political culture, the working and earning person who creates the welfare and wealth of the state, and a solidary society\".\nBranches of the party also nominated Paluckas, Sinkevičius and Orinta Leiputė, but all three of them refused the nomination. Paluckas took responsibility for the party's poor election results and did not want to escalate polarization within the party; Leiputė was content with remaining as one of the vice-chairwomen; and Sinkevičius did not want to risk defeat against experienced members of the party and was considered an ally of Olekas.\n\n\n== Campaign ==\nThe election campaign was considered tense. There were accusations that the party's leadership prefers Olekas and seeks to \"crown\" him as chairman. The party's honorary chairman Vytenis Povilas Andriukaitis published an open letter to the party's members recommending them to vote for Olekas. Outside observers judged that Olekas was more likely to win a party convention, while Blinkevičiūtė was more likely to win a direct election.\nGudžinskas withdrew from the election on 22 April, claiming that he succeeded in his goal of \"fostering democratic debate\", and endorsed Blinkevičiūtė, who he claimed was the closest to social democratic ideology of the remaining candidates. Mitrofanovas withdrew on 28 April, endorsed Olekas and cited his issues with the progressive, socially liberal wing of the party which had supported Gudžinskas. According to the rules of the leadership election, Mitrofanovas's withdrawal (less than a week before the election) was too late and he should have remained on the ballot, but it was accepted by the party leadership.\nOlekas had begun his campaign early, after the 2020 parliamentary election, and had the support of the party's veteran leaders, including Andriukaitis, Julius Sabatauskas and Algirdas Sysas. Blinkevičiūtė was hesitant and her campaign lacked resources, but she was encouraged by Paluckas and many party branches to participate, and she was widely popular among the lower levels of the party. She was notably popular among the party's women members. Olekas was accused of using sexist language during the campaign by claiming that \"leadership of the party during difficult times should be left in the hands of men\".\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== References ==\nIn-line\n\nBibliography\n\nJurkynas, Mindaugas; Unikaitė-Jakuntavičienė, Ingrida (2024). \"Politinės partijos Lietuvoje: rinkimai, lyderiai ir finansavimas: mokslo studija\".

Ahead of the 2008 season the name was changed to FC Arlanda to avoid connotations with Valsta Syrianska. The name was later reverted to Viña del Mar at the behest of club members belonging to the Chilean diaspora, but yet again changed to FC Arlanda ahead of the 2015 season.\nThe men's football team plays in the Division 2, the fifth tier of Swedish football. The club first reached Division 2 in 2021, but were relegated back.\nThe team also reached the first rounds of the Swedish Cup in 2017 and 2022.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nOfficial site\nSvenskfotboll.se",

        "content": "The San Sabá fight was an armed encounter between a heavily outnumbered group of American prospectors led by James Bowie and a band of Tawakoni, Waco and Caddo Indians, which took place on the San Saba River in Spanish Texas, on November 21, 1831.\n\n\n== Background ==\nShortly after settling and marrying in Mexican Texas with an eye to business, James \"Jim\" Bowie became fascinated with the local story of the long abandoned and lost silver mines of Los Almagres, said to be northwest of San Antonio, near the ruin of the Spanish Mission Santa Cruz de San Saba. According to legend, the mine had been operated by local Indians before being seized by the Spanish. After Mexico won independence from Spain, government interest in mining waned. A number of native groups roamed the area, including Comanche, Lipan Apache, Tawakoni, and Tonkawa. Without government troops to keep hostile natives at bay, mining and mineral exploration were impossible. Some believed that the Lipan had taken over the mine after the Mexican citizens left the area. The Indians apparently wished to prevent another influx of miners and adventurers into their hunting grounds — a condition that brought about the fate of the San Saba Mission, when its inmates, the miners, and people there congregated, were displaced by Indians in 1758.\n\n\n== The fight ==\nAfter obtaining permission from the Mexican government to mount an expedition into Indian territory to locate and re-open the silver mines, Bowie, his brother Rezin, and ten others set out for San Saba on November 2, 1831. Organized, equipped and led by the Bowie brothers, the exploring party consisted of Rezin P. and James Bowie, David Buchanan, Robert Armstrong, Jesse Wallace, Matthew Doyle, Thomas McCaslin, C. K. Ham, James Coryell (for whom Coryell county was named), and two servant boys, Charles, a black, and Gonzales, a Mexican.\nSix miles (10 km) from their goal, the group stopped to negotiate with a large raiding party—reportedly more than 120 Tawakoni and Waco, plus another 40 Caddo. The attempts at parley failed, and Bowie and his group fought for their lives for the next 13 hours. When the raiding party finally retreated, Bowie reportedly had lost only one man, while more than 40 Indians had been killed and 30 were wounded. In the meantime, a party of friendly Comanche rode into San Antonio bringing word of the raiding party, which outnumbered the Bowie expedition by 14 to 1. The citizens of San Antonio believed the members of the Bowie expedition must have perished, and Ursula Bowie began wearing widow's weeds.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nTo the town's surprise, the surviving members of the group returned to San Antonio on December 6. James Bowie's report of the expedition, written in Spanish, was printed in several newspapers, further establishing his reputation. He set out again the following month, with a larger force, but returned home empty-handed after 2+1⁄2 months of searching. In 1832 another, better known account of the encounter was published in a Philadelphia paper by Rezin Bowie.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nBrown, John Henry (1893).

Many species can grow on toxic compounds such as arsenate and selenate, and in fact flourish in contaminated sites. The Sulfurospirillum genus contains the only species on the planet that can respire organohalides. No species in the Sulfurospirillum genus have been found to be pathogenic thus far.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Clan Jetties form a residential neighbourhood within the city of George Town in the Malaysian state of Penang. Situated within the city's central business district, it now comprises seven wooden villages lining the coastal road of Weld Quay, each owned by residents of a specific Chinese clan – Ong, Lim, Chew, Tan, Lee, Mixed Clan and Yeoh jetties.\nThe community of Clan Jetties came into existence gradually over a period spanning from the 1880s to the 1960s. In total, nine clan villages were built, but developments post-independence reduced their number to the current seven. After the city centre was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2008, the Clan Jetties became a heritage tourism destination.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nGeorge Town as an entrepôt had attracted waves of immigration from southern China. The Hokkien-speaking immigrants from Fujian, in particular, had settled within the vicinity of the coastline, at areas such as at Tok Aka Lane, Acheen Street, Armenian Street and Stewart Lane.\nIn 1882, land was reclaimed along the former shoreline, creating what is now Weld Quay. This made it possible to build ghats along the reclaimed coastline, which in turn allowed for the construction of landing jetties. The jetties became the main point of arrival for new Chinese immigrants, and were gradually taken over by members of specific clans for the loading and unloading of cargo, as well as for sampan mooring. Rudimentary accommodations were built, which eventually became communal residences for these clans.\nThe Clan Jetties saw constant expansion as the immigrants from Fujian continued to arrive. Clan associations provided the immigrants, who preferred to settle in clan lines, with accommodation, employment and protection. Over time, the clans became segmented by occupation. The Ongs, Lims, Chews and Lees predominantly worked as boatmen, while the Tans, Yeohs and Koays were involved primarily in charcoal and firewood trading.\nBefore Malaya attained independence, the British authorities had promised residents of the Clan Jetties legal recognition of their homes. Following independence however, the residents were only provided with Temporary Occupation Licenses (TOL) that needed to be renewed annually, a status quo that remains to this day. This left residents vulnerable to development pressure as there were no guarantees of compensation if their houses were acquired for development.\n\nThe Clan Jetties were once considered “slums” in the face of \"neoliberal urbanisation\" policies that promoted the city's vertical growth. The Barisan Nasional-led state government at the time sought to demolish the Clan Jetties and relocate its inhabitants to high-rise complexes. The proposed demolition of the Clan Jetties, along with economic development that caused a shift in the workforce away from labour-intensive jobs, caused an exodus of the younger population from the area. The remaining residents of the Clan Jetties and local interest groups protested the redevelopment of the area, partly due to fears of the underlying racial agenda that favoured Malay land ownership under Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and concerns about the potential loss of intangible heritage.\nThe Koay and Peng Aun jetties were eventually destroyed in 2006. The UNESCO listing of the city centre as a World Heritage Site in 2008 prevented further redevelopment of the Clan Jetties, while simultaneously transforming the area into a tourist attraction. The shift towards heritage tourism has since led to additional concerns about liveability and gentrification at the jetties, exacerbated by the ageing population of the area. As part of ongoing efforts to preserve the Clan Jetties, the Penang Island City Council has designated almost all buildings at the Clan Jetties as Category II-protected structures and introduced guidelines to limit the overdependence on tourism.\n\n\n=== Ong Jetty ===\nThe Ong Jetty, the northernmost point of the Clan Jetties, was primarily occupied by the Ong clan from Luanmeishe in Tong'an, Xiamen. The jetty consisted of simple structures that served as resting sheds for the clan's boatmen. The jetty was eventually incorporated into the present-day Raja Tun Uda Ferry Terminal.\n\n\n=== Lim Jetty ===\nThe Lim Jetty is dominated by the Lim clan, who originally hailed from Houcunzhuang in Tong'an, Xiamen. The jetty suffered severe damage during the Japanese invasion in 1941 and was subsequently rebuilt after the war. It is characterised by houses with zinc roofs that are segregated into two distinct areas, with a single row of wooden huts lining the seafront walkway. The Lim Jetty is also home to a few places of worship that are dedicated to Chinese deities such as Mazu, Yama and Shennong, among others.\n\n\n=== Chew Jetty ===\nThe most visited of the Clan Jetties, the Chew Jetty was developed by the Chew clan originating from Xinglinshe in Tong'an, Xiamen. It is the focal point of the annual Jade Emperor’s birthday celebrations falling on the ninth day of the Chinese New Year. The jetty also houses places of worship dedicated to Chinese deities, including Baosheng and Xuantian. Following the inscription of the city centre as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, heritage tourism grew at Chew Jetty, resulting in an estimated 30% of the houses being converted into commercial outlets as of 2017.\n\n\n=== Tan Jetty ===\nThe Tan Jetty is predominantly occupied by the Tan clan from Bingzhoushe in Tong'an, Xiamen. The forefathers of the Tan Jetty community initially settled at Armenian Street before moving to the present-day jetty, where they constructed sheds to serve as rain shelters. The jetty also houses shrines dedicated to Chinese deities Tan Goan-kong and Mazu.\n\n\n=== Lee Jetty ===\nThe Lee Jetty was originally located at the Raja Tun Uda Ferry Terminal. The development of the ferry terminal in the early 1960s forced the Lee clan – who hailed from Duishancun in Tong'an, Xiamen – to relocate to the current Lee Jetty. The jetty has one shrine dedicated to Baosheng.\n\n\n=== Mixed Clan Jetty ===\nAlso known as the 'New Jetty', the Mixed Clan Jetty was built in 1962. Unlike the other jetties that are primarily occupied by separate clans, this jetty accommodates residents of various surnames. Construction of the new jetty followed stricter post-independence planning requirements from the state's Land Office. Two of the houses were demolished to make way for water-carrying submarine pipelines in 1973.\n\n\n=== Yeoh Jetty ===\nThe southernmost point of the Clan Jetties, the Yeoh Jetty was dominated by the Yeoh clan of Xiayangcun in Haicheng. The jetty was damaged during the Japanese invasion, displacing most of its original inhabitants. Following post-independence land reclamation, much of the jetty now sits on dry land.\n\n\n=== Demolished jetties ===\n\n\n==== Koay Jetty ====\nThe Koay Jetty was developed in the 1950s by the Koay clan from Baiqipu in Hui'an County, whose ancestors were Hui Muslim traders from Quanzhou. The Koays who migrated to Penang eventually assimilated with the wider Chinese community and distanced themselves from their original Muslim faith. The Koay Jetty once served as a hub for charcoal trade. After independence, land reclamation led to the jetty being engulfed by mangrove forest. The jetty was destroyed in 2006 to accommodate newer residential developments.\n\n\n==== Peng Aun Jetty ====\nPeng Aun Jetty came into existence in the 1960s and was home to residents with different surnames. It too was demolished along with the Koay Jetty in 2006 to make way for residential developments.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Miguel Joaquim de Almeida Castro (born in Ipueiras, December 4, 1834 – died in Recife, May 6, 1901), also known as Miguel Castro, was a Brazilian politician. He served as the president of the province of Piauí from May 1, 1882, to April 5, 1883.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe was born on the Convento farm, in the then parish of São Gonçalo da Serra dos Cocos (now a district of the municipality of Ipueiras, Ceará), son of Joaquim Felício de Almeida and Castro, a native of Rio Grande do Norte, and Cosma Rodrigues Veras. Through his father, he was a grandnephew of Padre Miguelinho, a participant in the Pernambucan Revolt of 1817, from whom he inherited his name.\nAt just eight months old, he moved with his family to Rio Grande do Norte, settling on the Olho d'Água dos Pinhos farm, now in the municipality of Triunfo Potiguar. There, he learned his first letters. In 1848, he went to the city of Imperatriz (Martins, Rio Grande do Norte) in the same province, where he studied Latin until 1851, when he then moved to Olinda to continue his studies and enroll in the Faculty of Law.\nHe graduated with a degree in law in 1858, in the same class as Tomás Antônio de Paula Pessoa, Ladislau Acrísio de Almeida Fortuna, and Cordolino Barbosa Cordeiro. However, in the fifth year of his course, he was elected provincial deputy for Rio Grande do Norte for the biennium of 1858–1859, after which he was re-elected.\nHe was appointed public prosecutor of the Maioridade district (Martins), by order of March 9, 1859, from Dr. Antônio Marcelino Nunes Gonçalves (later Viscount of São Luís), then president of the province, and by orders of January 6 and August 17 of the same year, public instruction delegate of the said city, and visiting agent of the Literary Circle of Maioridade and Mossoró.\nBy imperial decree of April 10, 1860, he was appointed municipal judge and orphans' judge of the term of Aracati, in Ceará, and police delegate and effective inspector of the classes of the same term, by orders of 5 and 23 of the same month of the year. By imperial decree of August 20, 1864, he was appointed judge of law of the district of Saboeiro, from which he was transferred at his request to that of Teixeira, in Paraíba, by decree of January 27, 1868. As he did not assume the position of the latter, he was declared surplus and ceased to be part of the active judiciary. However, he continued in public service, appointed, by order of March 16 of the same year, literary inspector of the Saboeiro district.\nBy imperial letters of May 18, 1878, and February 25, 1882, he was appointed fifth vice-president of Ceará and president of the province of Piauí, where he stayed for about a year. On May 23, 1883, he was honored with the commendation of the Imperial Order of the Rose.\nHe was elected general deputy, in 1885, for the fifth district of Ceará, as an abolitionist, and, in 1889, for the second district of Rio Grande do Norte. Joining the republican regime, he enlisted in the party led by Pedro Velho and was elected deputy to the Republican Constituent, in 1890.\nHe was the first governor elected by Rio Grande do Norte, in 1891. Having taken office on September 9, he was deposed by the federal public force on November 28, arrested, and taken to the 34th Battalion Barracks. Restored to power with the rise of Floriano Peixoto, he was deposed, retiring to Ceará and, later, to Recife, where he died. He served as a federal deputy until 1893, when he completely withdrew from politics.\nMiguel Castro died at the age of 66, from malaria, at the home of his son-in-law, José Otávio de Freitas. He was married, since 1868, to Rosa Maria Antunes de Oliveira, niece of the Viscount of Mecejana, with whom he had three children:\n\nJoaquim Felício Antunes de Almeida Castro (c. 1871 – May 28, 1897), Bachelor of Law from the Faculty of Recife in 1891;\nMiguel Joaquim Antunes de Almeida Castro (died in Rio de Janeiro, August 16, 1935), married to Maria Magalhães Silva, had children;\nRosa Maria Antunes de Almeida Castro (died in Recife, April 29, 1962), unmarried;\nMaria de Castro Freitas, born Maria Cristina Antunes de Almeida Castro (died in Recife, June 4, 1958), wife of Dr. Otávio de Freitas, with children.\nRosa Maria died at the age of 78, on October 22, 1930.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2012 Wisconsin Fall General Election was held in the U.S. state of Wisconsin on November 6, 2012.  One of Wisconsin's U.S. Senate seats and all of Wisconsin's eight seats in the United States House of Representatives were up for election, as well as sixteen seats in the Wisconsin State Senate and all 99 seats in the Wisconsin State Assembly.  Voters also chose ten electors to represent them in the Electoral College, which then participated in selecting the president of the United States.  The 2012 Fall Partisan Primary was held on August 14, 2012.  In the presidential election, Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan was the Republican nominee for Vice President of the United States.\n2012 also saw the culmination of the recall effort in Wisconsin which had been incited by Governor Scott Walker's 2011 Wisconsin Act 10, which stripped public employee unions of collective bargaining rights.  During 2012, Walker faced a recall election along with four Republican state senators.  These recall elections were all held on June 5, 2012, with a special primary on May 8.  Walker survived the gubernatorial recall, but Democrats gained control of the state Senate.\nIn the Fall general election, the Democratic presidential candidate, incumbent president Barack Obama, won Wisconsin's ten electoral votes and secured a second four-year term.  U.S. Senator Herb Kohl retired and was succeeded by fellow Democrat Tammy Baldwin; there was no change to the partisan makeup of Wisconsin's congressional delegation, remaining at five Republicans and three Democrats.  This was also the first legislative election after a dramatic Republican gerrymander was implemented in 2011; Republicans gained two seats in the Wisconsin Senate, regaining the majority, and maintained their majority in the Wisconsin State Assembly.\nThe 2012 Wisconsin Spring Election was held April 3, 2012.  This election featured a not-yet-settled Republican party presidential nominating contest, and various judicial and local elections, including county executive and mayoral elections in Wisconsin's largest city and county, Milwaukee.  The 2012 Wisconsin Spring Primary was held February 21, 2012.\n\n\n== Federal offices ==\n\n\n=== President ===\n\nIncumbent president Barack Obama sought a second four-year term. In Wisconsin, voters elected Obama's electoral slate.  Obama went on to win the majority of the electoral college.\n\n\n==== Democratic primary ====\n\nIn the 2012 Democratic Party presidential primaries, the Wisconsin Democratic presidential preference primary was held concurrent with the Spring general election, April 3, 2012.  The only candidate for the Democratic nomination was incumbent president Barack Obama, who received about 98% of the vote.\n\n\n==== Republican primary ====\n\nIn the 2012 Republican Party presidential primaries, the Wisconsin Republican presidential preference primary was held concurrent with the Spring general election, April 3, 2012.  As the incumbent president was a Democrat, the Republican presidential nominating contest was open and saw nine candidates enter the race.  By the time of Wisconsin's presidential preference primary, only four candidates remained in the race, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, former U.S. senator Rick Santorum (PA), former Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich (GA), and U.S. Representative Ron Paul (TX).  Other candidates whose names appeared on the ballot included former Ambassador Jon Huntsman Jr. (UT) and U.S. Representative Michele Bachman (MN).  \nMitt Romney won the Wisconsin Republican presidential preference primary with 44%, Santorum received 37% of the votes, Paul received 11%, with 6% going to Gingrich.\n\n\n==== General election ====\nBarack Obama won the presidential election against Mitt Romney and was awarded Wisconsin's ten electoral votes.  \n\n\n=== U.S. Senate ===\n\nA regularly scheduled election was held for Wisconsin's Class 1 U.S. Senate seat at the Fall general election, November 6, 2012.  The incumbent, Herb Kohl, first elected in 1988, retired after 24 years in the U.S. Senate.  The election was won by Democrat Tammy Baldwin, who had previously served 14 years in the U.S. House of Representatives.  Baldwin received 51% of the vote and defeated former Wisconsin governor Tommy Thompson in the general election.  With her election, Baldwin became the first openly gay member of the U.S. Senate and Wisconsin's first female U.S. senator.\n\n\n=== U.S. House ===\nAll 8 of Wisconsin's congressional districts were up for election at the Fall general election, November 6, 2012.  Seven of the eight incumbent representatives ran for reelection, with Tammy Baldwin vacating District 2 to run for U.S. Senate.  Party composition remained unchanged after the general election.\n\n\n== State offices ==\n\n\n=== Executive ===\n\n\n==== Gubernatorial recall ====\n\nWisconsin governor Scott Walker and lieutenant governor Rebecca Kleefisch were subject to recall petitions in the Spring of 2012 and faced recall elections on June 5, 2012.  They both survived the recall elections; Walker received 53% of the vote in a rematch with his 2010 opponent, Milwaukee mayor Tom Barrett.  Kleefisch defeated Fire Fighters union president Mahlon Mitchell.\n\n\n=== Legislative ===\n\n\n==== State Senate recall ====\n\nFour Wisconsin state senators were subjects of a coordinated recall effort to remove them from office in the Spring of 2012.  The four recall elections occurred on June 5, 2012.  One incumbent, Van H. Wanggaard, was defeated in the recall.  One other chose to resign and was replaced by another of the same party.  The net result was that Democrats gained the majority of the state Senate. \n\n\n==== State Senate 33rd district special election ====\nA special election was held December 2, 2012, to fill the 33rd State Senate seat vacated by Rich Zipperer, who resigned to become deputy chief of staff to Governor Scott Walker.  Republican state representative Paul Farrow won the seat without opposition.  \n\n\n==== State Senate ====\n\nThe 16 even-numbered districts out of 33 seats in the Wisconsin Senate were up for election at the Fall general election, November 6, 2012.  Ten of these seats were held by Democrats and six were held by Republicans.  Prior to the election, Democrats controlled the chamber with a 17 to 16 majority.  Republicans flipped two seats in the general election, taking an 18–15 majority going into the 101st Wisconsin Legislature.\n\n\n==== State Assembly ====\n\nAll 99 seats of the Wisconsin State Assembly were up for election at the Fall general election, November 6, 2012.  This was the first election after the redistricting of the legislature in 2011, and 21 seats had no incumbent on the ballot in this election.  Republicans won 60 seats, matching their total from the 2010 election and maintaining their majority going into the 101st Wisconsin Legislature.\n\n\n=== Judicial ===\n\n\n==== State Supreme Court ====\nThere was no election for Wisconsin Supreme Court in 2012.\n\n\n==== State Court of Appeals ====\nFour seats on the Wisconsin Court of Appeals were on the ballot at the Spring general election, April 3, 2012.  None of the elections were contested, one new judge was elected.\n\nIn District I, incumbent judge Ralph Adam Fine was elected to a fifth six-year term, running unopposed.  He was first elected in 1988.\nIn District II, incumbent chief judge Richard S. Brown was elected to a sixth six-year term, running unopposed.  He was first elected in 1978 (to a four-year term).\nIn District III, incumbent judge Mark Mangerson, appointed by Governor Scott Walker in 2011, was elected to his first six-year term, running unopposed.\nIn District IV, assistant state attorney general JoAnne Kloppenburg was elected to a six-year term, running unopposed, to succeed retiring judge Margaret J. Vergeront.\n\n\n==== State Circuit Courts ====\nFifty two of the state's 249 circuit court seats were on the ballot at the Spring general election, April 3, 2012. Twelve of those elections were contested, two incumbents were defeated.\n\n\n== Local offices ==\n\n\n=== Kenosha County ===\n\n\n==== Kenosha mayor ====\nA regularly scheduled mayoral election was held in Kenosha, Wisconsin, at the Spring general election, April 3, 2012.  The incumbent Keith Bosman, first elected in 2008, was elected to a second four-year term, defeating city council president Jesse Downing.  Two other candidates were eliminated in the February primary: video producer Jeff Baas and bar owner Nasser Museitif.\n\n\n=== Marathon County ===\n\n\n==== Wausau mayor ====\nA regularly scheduled mayoral election was held in Wausau, Wisconsin, at the Spring general election, April 3, 2012.  The incumbent Jim Tipple, first elected in 2004, was elected to a third four-year term.\n\n\n=== Milwaukee County ===\n\n\n==== Milwaukee mayor ====\n\nA regularly scheduled mayoral election was held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at the Spring general election, April 3, 2012.

One other candidate was eliminated in the February primary, Ieshuh Griffin.\n\n\n==== Milwaukee County executive ====\nA regularly scheduled county executive election was held in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, at the Spring general election, April 3, 2012.  The incumbent Chris Abele, first elected in a 2011 special election, was elected to his first four-year term without opposition.\n\n\n=== Outagamie County ===\n\n\n==== Appleton mayor ====\nA regularly scheduled mayoral election was held in Appleton, Wisconsin, at the Spring general election, April 3, 2012.

        "content": "Marcus Linday (born 2 June 2003) is a Swedish footballer who plays as a midfielder for Västerås SK in Allsvenskan.\nLinday started his youth career in Pershagens SK. He made his senior debut for Assyriska FF in 2020. The team languished in lower leagues, contesting the 2021 Division 1 but being relegated to the Division 2, the fourth tier. Linday vowed to stay in Assyriska despite offers from other clubs. In 2022 the team had the chance to win promotion via playoff, but failed. In 2023 Linday decided to stay one more season in Assyriska, and the team managed to return to the third tier.\nDuring his time at Assyriska, Linday consistently made lists of the greatest young talents as well as the best overall players in Division 2.\nAs the team Västerås SK won promotion to the 2024 Allsvenskan, reaching that level for the first time since 1997, its first signing during the winter transfer window was Marcus Linday. He had been on trial with Västerås in the summer of 2023. Despite going directly from the fourth to the first tier, Linday impressed in the 2023–24 Svenska Cupen match against Hammarby, which Västerås won 2–1 away. He made his Allsvenskan debut in April 2024 against AIK.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Operation 17 August (Indonesian:Operasi 17 Agustus) was a military operation led by Colonel Ahmad Yani which aimed to crush the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PRRI) movement in West Sumatra, specifically in Padang. This military operation is a joint operation involving the Indonesian Navy, Army and Air Force. \"August 17\" refers to the password used by Colonel Ahmad Yani.\nThe deployment of military force to crush PRRI's power was the largest ever recorded in Indonesian military historyFor three years, there was a civil war between the central army and PRRI troops which resulted in many PRRI casualties. The number of victims resulting from the short PRRI conflict was far greater than the victims of the war with the Dutch during the independence revolution.Apart from that, many were not involved in PRRI but were victims of violence such as torture, robbery, and rape.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nPRRI is a movement carried out by regional governments towards the central government. This movement, which is considered a rebellion, was triggered by the local government's dissatisfaction in several cities in Sumatra regarding the central government's fund allocation policy as well as various disparities in development, especially in areas outside Java.This sense of dissatisfaction was also supported by several military commanders.\nBecause of this, the central government considers that this movement must be resolved immediately by force of arms. President Sukarno gave Ahmad Yani a mandate to carry out military operations to destroy the PRRI in West Sumatra.Ahmad Yani was also given the mandate to lead TNI troops in Padang.\n\n\n== Chronology ==\nApril 17 1958 was the day determined for the initial landing in Padang. At 05.00 – 06.00 WIB, shooting at the landing point was carried out by the Indonesian Navy. Then 25 minutes later, Indonesian Air Force troops using the \"Red Flight\" aircraft carried out shooting, followed by the \"Blue Flight\" aircraft. This shooting attack was aimed at Tabing airport.\nNot long after, Indonesian marine troops landed via Padang Beach. In the afternoon, all joint forces successfully landed in Padang. This occupation operation lasted for one and a half months. As a result, the cities of Padang, Solok, Payakumbuh and Bukittinggi were successfully controlled by the TNI.\n\n\n== Results ==\nOn May 24 1958, 500 PRRI soldiers surrendered. With this, PRRI was successfully crushed.\n\n\n== References ==",

The other list emerged from the GC group, formed by Sardinia 20Twenty and Sardinia in the Centre, obtained 5.5% of the vote and three regional councillors, including Peru.\n\n\n== Leadership ==\nSecretary: Gerolimo Solina (2023–present)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Meskerem Mees (born 15 July 1999) is a Belgian singer and songwriter.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMees was born in Addis Abeba, Ethiopia on 15 July 1999. She came to Merendree near Deinze, Belgium, through adoption when she was ten months old. Her first name means \"new beginning\", which refers to 1 September, the first day of the Ethiopian New Year. After high school in Ghent and MUDA Atheneum for Performing Arts in Evergem, she followed an extra year at Vestjyllands Højskole in Denmark where she developed her creative skills in painting, music, cooking, dance and singing.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 2013, Mees participated in Who will be Junior? and had Brahim as coach, although she did not win the competition. In 2019, she won the Sound Track stage competition. A year later she released the debut single Joe, which ended up at #1 in De Afrekening. She also participated in Humo's Rock Rally 2020, which she also won. In 2021 she won the Montreux Jazz Talent Awards and in 2022 the Music Moves Europe Award (Grand Jury Award). In 2024 she was winner of the Golden Afro Artistic Awards, category Musique. Meskerem Mees is also the name under which the singer-songwriter initially performed with cellist Febe Lazou and later with cellist Frederik Daelemans.\nSince 2023, Mees has been collaborating on the performance Exit Above by theater maker Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker. When the latter goes looking for music for a new performance, she takes a detour to guitarist Jean-Marie Aerts. De Keersmaeker felt that a female voice is missing and she then contacted Mees, who not only wants to sing but also compose (together with Jean-Marie Aerts and Carlos Garbin) and dance with the dancers of Rosas. The starting point for the music is Walking Blues by Robert Johnson and in the performance “walking as a primal movement and the blues as a musical origin come together”. Exit Above had a world premiere on 31 May 2023 at the Théâtre National Wallonie-Bruxelles, and has also been shown at the Volksoper Wien, the Concertgebouw Brugge, the Festival d'Avignon, the Haus der Berliner Festspiele, the Kaaitheater, Opera Ghent, De Singel, Theater Rotterdam, and other theaters in Norway, Sweden, Italy, Germany and France. In 2024, the production is set to travel to the Hasselt Cultural Center, the Netherlands, Germany, France and Spain for various performances.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nJulius (2021)\n\n\n== References ==",

From the Latin “claro montium” which means “clear, illustrious mountain”; “sous-Huy” (downstream of Huy) allows it to be distinguished from other Clermonts.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first Count of Clermont was Lambert, Count of Clermont and Montaigu. The second, Gislebert de Duras, Count of Clermont, was a companion of Godfrey de Bouillon during the crusade of 1096; before his departure, he offered part of his fortune to the Abbaye de Cluny which built the Saints-Pierre-et-Paul church of Saint-Séverin-en-Condroz.\nA successor, Gilles de Clermont, founded the Val-Saint-Lambert Abbey by donation to the nuns of Signy.\nThe family died out in the 12th century.\n\n\n== Archaeological excavations ==\nExcavations led to the discovery of traces of a Gallo-Roman villa from the 1st century at the bottom of Avry (on the plateau), a Roman habitat and a lime kiln which operated in the 3rd century in the valley. The 100 m long villa had a gallery and baths.\nThe castle of the Counts of Clermont was built in Engihoul, on the rocky spur which forms the north of the ancient commune of Éhein. Various texts mention it and indicate that it was besieged in 1095 by the prince-bishop Otbert because he constituted a threat to the control of the Meuse. Having become the property of the prince-bishops, it was attacked by the Hutois in 1300. Later, it constituted a resting place for Adolphe de La Marck who also died there. The liégeoise and Hutoise militias, which emerged victorious from the battle of Vottem in July 1346, led by de Baré de Voroux, consul of Liège, attacked it the following September, burned it and razed it. The castle was never rebuilt again. Ruins were still visible in 1835. Les Chercheurs de la Wallonie found and excavated them in 1975.\n\n\n== Industry ==\nThe Belgian Poudreries de Clermont, which later became the Poudreries Reunites de Belgique then PB Clermont, were founded there in 1850.\n\n\n== Related personalities ==\nHilarion-Christmas of Villenfagne of Ingihoul\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Clermont-sous-Huy at Wikimedia Commons\nPresentation of the villages of the entity (including Engis)",

        "content": "Scheduled castes in Punjab, or Dalits in Punjab are the officially designated groups in Punjab state in India which are most disadvantaged due to the caste system. They were placed in the lowest ranks of the caste system, because of which they suffered and are still suffering from social, political, economic and personal discrimination.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1900,  Punjab Land Alienation Act was passed, which had the unintended consequence of depriving Dalits the right to own land, because they were not officially not considered an 'agricultural caste' by the British government.\nIn June 1926, Ad-Dharm movement was launched by Babu Mangu Ram Mugowalia for the upliftment of the Dalits of Punjab. Ad-Dharam movement's aim was to create a separate religion and identity for the Dalits. The first meeting of the movement was held on 11-12 June 1926 in Hoshiarpur.\nThe movement also created its political organization, called Ad-Dharam Mandal, to fullfill its political ideas. It contested the 1937 elections and won one seat. It was successful in spreading awareness and assertion among Dalits. They also contested 1945-46 elections in alliance with Unionist Party, in which Mangoo Ram got elected. To bring consciousness in the Dalit community, they also started newspapers like Adi Danka and Ujjala.\nOn 21 September 2021, Charanjit Singh Channi became the first person from Dalit community to become the Chief Minister of Punjab. He was appointed as a chief minister by Congress Party after the resignation of Captain Amarinder Singh. He ruled for about 6 months before expiry of his term.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of September 2020, the caste population data foreach Forward caste citizen in Punjab collected in Socio Economic and Caste Census 2011 has not been released to public by Government of India. Scheduled Castes and Other Backward Classes form 63.2% of the total population of Punjab.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, 73.3% SC population predominantly lives in rural areas and 26.6% in urban areas of Punjab. In the state, 60.8% SCs follow Sikhism, 38.8% Hinduism and 0.3% Buddhism.\nBelow is the list of districts according to the percentage of their SC population, according to 2011 census.\n\nScheduled caste (SC) population among different religions in Punjab - Census 2011\n\n\n== Health ==\nAs per National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4, 2015–16), the\ninfant mortality rate was 40 per 1000 live births before the age of one year for scheduled castes, compared to 29 per 1000 births for the state as a whole. The infant mortality rate for other backward castes (OBC) was 21 per 1000 live births and 22 per 1000 for those who are not from SC and OBC classes.\nAlthough the prevalence of anaemia (low levels of haemoglobin in the blood) has been found quite high among all\npopulation groups in Punjab, it was still higher among the SC population than other groups. For the women between the ages of 15 and 49 years, the prevalence of anaemia among SC women was 56.9%, compared to 53.5% for the state as a whole. Among the children between the ages of 6 and 59 months, the rate of anaemia for SC children was 60%, compared to 56.9% for the state as a whole.\nThe table below compares the health status of Scheduled Caste population of Punjab, according to NFHS-3.\n\nThe table below shows the early childhood mortality rates in Punjab by caste, according to NFHS-4 (2015-16).\n\n\n== Education ==\nAccording to the 2011 census, the literacy rate among Scheduled Castes in Punjab was 64.81%, compared to 75.84% for the whole state. The SC literacy rate of females was 58.39% and 70.66% for male SCs.\nThe table below gives the literacy rate of Scheduled castes by district, according to the 2011 census.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nAs of 2023, out of the 117 [[List of constituencies of the Punjab Legislative Assembly\n|legislative assembly constituencies in Punjab]], 34 are reserved for Scheduled Castes.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nDespite comprising 31.94% of the Punjab's population, Dalits own only 3.5% of its total land. About 73.33% of the Dalit population lives in villages and is largely landless and faces housing shortages. According to the Punjab Village Common Lands (Regulation) Act, 1964, 33% of the village commons land (shamlaat) is reserved for the Dalits. But in many cases, they have been denied these rights by big landlords with fraudlent means.\n\n\n== Atrocities ==\nIn 2019, 166 crimes against Dalits were reported in Punjab. This amounted to the rate of 1.9 crimes per 1 Lakh of the Dalit population in the state. This rate was lower than the 22.8 per 1 Lakh Dalit population for the country as a whole.\nThe table below shows the number of recorded crimes against scheduled caste and scheduled tribe people from 2010 to 2018.\n\n\n== See also ==\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes\nDalit\nCaste system in India\nDemographics of Punjab, India\n\n\n== References ==",

It is found in India, Thailand, and Malaysia.\n\n\n== Identification ==\nThe overall colour is brown, the tip of the head extension, which is also known as a cephalic process, is red. The basal 2/3rds of the forewings, also known as the tegmen in Fulgoridae, can be brown to green. It can be distinguished from all similar species except Pyrops pythicus by the colour, and from it by the presence of outlined circles, not unmargined spots, at 2/3rds of the tegmen. Also, P. pythicus is in Indonesia, but P. pyrorhynchus is found on mainland S and SE Asia.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nFrom Greek – πυρ (fire/flame) and ῥύγχος (snout)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Peter Michael Lansdorp (born December 16, 1952) is recognized for his contributions in the fields of hematology, medical genetics and cancer research. He has made significant contributions to the understanding of genome instability, particularly in relation to aging and cancer. His research has focused on the biology of blood-forming stem cells, telomeres and genome analysis. He is also known for the development of techniques including single cell Strand-seq and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques such as Q-FISH and flow FISH.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nPeter Lansdorp grew up in the Netherlands (Den Haag and Wassenaar). He obtained a Medical Degree from the Erasmus University in Rotterdam in 1976. His early career included work on monoclonal antibodies at Sanquin and he obtained a PhD from the University of Amsterdam in 1985. Between 2011 and 2017, he was the Founding Scientific Director of the European Research Institute for the Biology of Aging at the University of Groningen, the Netherlands. He returned to Vancouver in 2017, resuming his role as a Distinguished Scientist at the Terry Fox Laboratory and a professor in Hematology and Medical Genetics at the University of British Columbia.\n\n\n== Research ==\nIn 1984, Lansdorp made a significant contribution to the field of monoclonal antibodies with the discovery of a method to efficiently form bifunctional tetrameric antibody complexes. This method was patented and later licensed to StemCell Technologies in Vancouver. Lansdorp's early work in Vancouver predominantly focused on experimental hematology. He first demonstrated that the functional properties of purified \"candidate\" blood forming stem cells, including their self-renewal properties, change dramatically during development. He subsequently showed that telomere repeats are lost in purified hematopoietic stem cells supporting the concept that blood stem cells do not truly \"self-renew\" but are mortal like most other somatic cells.\nLansdorp also developed a novel fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) method to measure the length of telomere repeats using peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes. He subsequently showed that flow cytometry can be used to measure the average telomere length in individual nucleated blood cells.\nIn 2002 Lansdorp provided compelling evidence for the formation of guanine quadruplex (G4) DNA structures in C. elegans. He proposed that the dog-1 helicase gene is required to unwind G4 DNA structures that occasionally form during DNA synthesis.\n\n\n== References ==",

The plan was to assassinate Zia-ul-Haq during the Pakistan Day parade on March 23, 1980, however the plot was exposed and Malik, his son (Naveed Tajammal) and the other conspirators were arrested and sentenced to rigorous life imprisonment.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1977, Zia ul Haq came to power via the coup against the elected government of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and imposed martial law on the country. He established a semi-Islamist regime in the country. Tajammul Hussain Malik aimed to replace his fake \"Islamist\" regime with a fully theocratic one.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe plot was to assassinate Zia-ul-Haq and launch a coup to depose the government with an Islamic one. The attempted assassination and coup were planned for 23 March 1980, during the annual 23 March Pakistan Day Parade. The masterminds behind the coup were high-ranking military and intelligence officers, and were led by Major General Tajammal Hussain Malik; his son Captain Naveed; and his nephew Major Riaz, a former military intelligence officer.\n\n\n== Failure ==\nThe ISI became aware of this plot but decided against arresting the men outright because they did not know how deep the conspiracy went, and kept them under strict surveillance. As the date of the annual parade approached, the ISI was satisfied that it had identified the major players in the conspiracy and arrested the men along with some high-ranking military officers.\n\n\n== Arrest of coup plotters ==\nMalik, his son (Naveed Tajammal) and the other conspirators were arrested and sentenced to rigorous life imprisonment. Though offered chances of exile, even when the risk of being executed was high, General Malik and his son (Naveed Tajammal) never took the offer to be exiled and preferred their homeland. Malik was released from imprisonment in 1988 following the death of Zia-ul-Haq in a plane crash.\n\n\n== References ==",

In a review for The Austin Chronicle, they gave the single a positive reception and called it a \"recount of her barmaid past.\" In his review, Robert Christgau noted the song as a highlight from One of the Boys along with \"If You Want a Mother\". In an overall negative review for Slant Magazine, Jonathan Keefe negatively called the single derivative and said it \"didn't hold up in the album's company.\"\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\n\"You Don't Have to Go Home\" debuted at number 60 on the US Hot Country Songs chart the week of October 20, 2007. It reached its peak position of number 53 on the chart on November 3, 2007, becoming Wilson's first ever single to miss the top forty.

        "content": "The 6th Mississippi Infantry Regiment was a unit of the Confederate States Army that fought in many battles of the Western theater of the American Civil War. After taking heavy casualties at the Battle of Shiloh, the 6th Regiment fought in the Vicksburg Campaign, operations against anti-Confederate guerillas in Jones County, Mississippi, the Atlanta campaign, and the Franklin-Nashville campaign. \n\n\n== Formation ==\nThe volunteer companies that made up the 6th Mississippi were organized in the spring and summer of 1861, originally for state service, and were then mustered into Confederate service on August 24, 1861 at Grenada, Mississippi, with an original total strength of 601 men and officers. The Regiment was then sent to Kentucky where it joined Patrick Cleburne's brigade. In Kentucky the Regiment suffered from serious outbreaks of disease that reduced the total effective strength at one point to only 150 men. The Regiment was moved to Corinth, Mississippi after the fall of Fort Donelson to US forces in February, 1862.\n\n\n== Shiloh ==\n\nAs part of Cleburne's brigade, in General William J. Hardee's Third Army Corps, the 6th Mississippi took part in the Battle of Shiloh on April 6-7, 1862. On the morning of April 6 the Regiment advanced against the Union lines at Rhea field alongside the 23rd Tennessee Infantry Regiment, but their advance was impeded by a bog and the obstacles of the Federal camp. The regiment took heavy fire from troops of the 53rd Ohio Infantry Regiment and Illinois Light Artillery, suffering severe casualties. The commander of the Regiment, Colonel John J. Thornton was wounded, and \"a quick and bloody repulse was the consequence\" of the Confederate advance, according to brigade commander Cleburne. 60 men of the Regiment reformed ranks for a counterattack led by Captain A.Y. Harper, and the Union forces retreated, but the 6th Mississippi had taken such heavy losses that it needed to be sent to the rear, as Cleburne reported: \"Its terrible loss in the morning, the want of all its field and most of its company officers, had completely disorganized it and unfitted it for further service.\"\nThe 6th Regiment suffered a 76% casualty rate at Shiloh, earning it the nickname of \"The Bloody Sixth\". Cleburne's brigade as a whole suffered close to 1,000 casualties, the highest of any brigade engaged at the battle, Union or Confederate. A monument to the 6th Mississippi was dedicated at Shiloh National Military Park in 2015, located at Rhea field where the troops of the Regiment fell in battle. After Shiloh, the Regiment was sent to camp at Corinth and reorganized. Colonel Thornton resigned, Robert Lowry was elected as the new Colonel, and A.Y. Harper was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel. The Regiment was assigned to General John S. Bowen's brigade in Major General John C. Breckinridge's reserve corps and transferred to a supporting position near Vicksburg, Mississippi in the summer of 1862.\n\n\n== Vicksburg and Knight Company ==\nBowen's brigade, including the 6th Regiment, was assigned to Major General Earl Van Dorn's corps and sent to fight at the Second Battle of Corinth in October. The brigade then acted as Van Dorn's rear guard during the retreat from Corinth, and later returned to the Vicksburg area to prepare for the Union advance on the city.  \nDuring the Vicksburg campaign, the 6th Regiment was assigned to General Lloyd Tilghman's brigade. In April, the 6th was sent to reinforce General Martin E. Green and General Bowen's troops, and on May 1 fought in the Battle of Port Gibson. The 6th Mississippi charged a Union battery during the battle at Port Gibson, taking heavy fire before retreating, and afterwards General Green reported that, \"Colonel Lowry, of the Sixth Mississippi, deserves the highest commendation for his coolness and promptness in executing every order.\"  At the Battle of Champion Hill on May 16, the Regiment engaged in skirmishes with Union troops, and brigade commander General Tilghman was killed by artillery fire.\nThe Regiment was moved within the Vicksburg defensive lines during the siege of the city, where it was captured along with the rest of the Confederate garrison on July 4, 1863. \nAfter being exchanged and reorganized in 1864, the 6th Regiment was reassigned to General Leonidas Polk's Corps. In late March, Polk sent the 6th Regiment under Colonel Lowry's command to southern Mississippi to fight, in the word of Polk's order: \"deserters and disloyal men.\" These men were Newton Knight's band of Unionist guerillas who had disrupted Confederate control of Jones County and the surrounding region. The Confederate troops under Lowry fought skirmishes with the guerillas and summarily executed 9 of Knight's men by hanging. Others who had deserted and were in hiding near their homes in south Mississippi were forced back into the Confederate ranks. Despite these efforts, the Confederate forces did not capture Knight or stop the flow of desertion and Unionist resistance in Mississippi. The 6th Regiment lost 1 killed and 2 wounded in operations against Knight's Company.\n\n\n== 1864-1865 campaigns ==\nIn May 1864, the 6th Regiment was sent to Georgia to join General John Adams' brigade during the Atlanta Campaign. The 6th fought at the Battle of Resaca, Battle of New Hope Church, Battle of Kennesaw Mountain, Battle of Peachtree Creek, and the Battle of Atlanta. \nThe Regiment then joined the Franklin–Nashville campaign, and Colonel Lowry of the 6th Mississippi took command of Adams' brigade after General Adams was killed in the Battle of Franklin on November 30. Lieutenant Colonel Thomas J. Borden took command of the regiment after Lowry's promotion, commanding the regiment at the Battle of Nashville in December. \nDuring the final stages of the war, the 6th was sent to take part in General Joseph E. Johnston's Carolinas campaign, fighting at Kinston, North Carolina and the Battle of Bentonville in March 1865. The Regiment, along with the rest of Johnston's command, surrendered at Durham, North Carolina on April 26.  \n\n\n== Commanders ==\nCommanders of the 6th Mississippi Infantry:\n\nCol. John J. Thornton, wounded at Shiloh, resigned 1862.\nCol. Robert Lowry, promoted to Brigadier General, 1865.\nLt. Col. Enoch R. Bennett\nLt. Col. A.Y. Harper\nLt. Col. Thomas J.

        "content": "Redkey USB Ltd. is a British software company established in April 2018 after a crowfunding campaign on Kickstarter. The company specializes in creating proprietary utilities for secure data erasure. Its main product, the Redkey USB, is designed to securely erase data from a variety of storage devices.\n\n\n== History ==\nRedkey USB Ltd. has engaged in several crowdfunding campaigns on Kickstarter and Indiegogo platforms to fund its developments:\n\nRedkey USB V1: Launched on Kickstarter in March 2018 and later on Indiegogo, raising a total of £11,901 from 304 backers.\nRedkey USB V2: Subsequent campaigns on Kickstarter and Indiegogo from December 2018 to November 2019, raising £92,651 from 1851 backers.\nRedkey USB V3: A 2020 Kickstarter campaign and an Indiegogo continuation in 2021 achieved a combined total of £110,230 from 2,277 backers.\nRedkey USB V4: Launched on Kickstarter in November 2022 and continued on Indiegogo until April 2022, raising £154,561 from 1,702 backers.\nRedkey USB V5: Initiated on Kickstarter in May 2023 and extended on Indiegogo to December 2023, amassing £115,594 from 1113 backers.\nRedkey USB Make/100: A Kickstarter campaign in January 2024 raised £13,817 from 104 backers.\n\n\n== Certifications and awards ==\nThe company's software was accredited by ADISA in 2020, achieving Test Level 1 for HDD & SSD devices, later enhanced in 2023 to include Test Level 2 and Test Level 1 for Apple & Android mobile devices. ADISA certifications are valid for three years.\nIn 2021, Redkey USB was the winner of the Global Business Excellence Awards in the Outstanding Innovation category and runner-up in the Computing Security Awards for Secure Asset Disposal Company of the Year.\nIn 2023, Redkey USB was runner-up in the Computing Security Awards for Secure Asset Disposal Company of the Year and winner for Security Project of the Year.\n\n\n== Products and technology ==\nRedkey USB is a bootable live USB drive utility for secure data erasure, sold effectively as a security dongle requiring software installation by the user. Based on the Linux Debian platform, it integrates various algorithms for internal and external erasure, supporting Intel-based x86-64 PCs and Macs. It uses ATA standards to erase hidden areas, such as the DCO and HPA. Features include secure erasure, reporting, certification support, remote wiping, and various other features across several product versions.\n\n\n=== Developments ===\nV1: Introduced HDD erasure.\nV3: Brought secure erasure, reporting, and Level 1 certification.\nV4: Added remote wiping and an interface redesign.\nV5: Featured automated mobile device erasure and Level 2 certification.\n\n\n=== Product range ===\nRedkey USB's products focus on data erasure tools available in Home, Professional, and Ultimate editions, transitioning from pre-installed software to user-installed versions.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nIn 2022, the company moved from a key-shaped USB design to a dual USB connector style, diverging from its original design convention and leading to user disappointment. The device is limited to erasing one device at a time due to licensing restrictions.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

It is based on the Spanish film of the same name.\n\n\n== Development ==\nThe game was developed by Madrid-based Virtual Toys in partnership with Cinemaware. The game was originally released in Europe in 2003 and later in North America in Summer 2004.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nTal Blevins from IGN said \"It's a slow-paced shooter with shoddy AI, dated graphics and a frustrating design. Even though it's good for a few irreverent laughs, it's not worth paying for, even if you find it hanging out in the bargain bin... or a hot tub\"\nGameSpot said \"Given its lurid subject matter, Torrente, bad as it is, might have been some kind of epic disaster or at least an interesting failure. Instead, its awfulness is entirely, depressingly average. If nothing else, collectors of all things Torrente can buy it, store it, and keep it in mint condition in the box, and not feel as if they've missed anything\"\nThe game sold over 240,000 units in Europe.\n\n\n== References ==",

On her mother's advice, she also studied pop and jazz singing there. In mid-2020, she signed her first record deal with the Canadian label Nettwerk. With her debut EP \"Honeymoon Phase\" (2021), she won the \"Best Sound\" recording studio award at the Amadeus Austrian Music Awards in April 2022. A few months earlier, she had released her debut album \"My world, My love, Paris\". She accompanied, among others, Milow, Tom Odell, Stu Larsen, HAEVN and Matt Simons on tour. In August 2024 she will appear as the opening act for Coldplay in Vienna's Ernst-Happel-Stadion for four days.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOska grew up with her four older siblings in Rastenfeld, Lower Austria (Krems-Land District). The inspiration for her stage name came from her eldest brother \"Oskar\", with whom she also wrote her first song. She taught herself to play the guitar in her youth.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nMy world, My love, Paris (2022)\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\nHoneymoon Phase (2021)\nIt’s Normal to Shiver (2022)\n Live at TV Noir (2023)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n2020: Come Home\n2020: Distant Universe (Live Acoustic Session)\n2020: Honeymoon Phase / Wide Awake & Dreaming\n2021: In the Bleak Midwinter\n2022: Hallucinating (It's Normal to Shiver Version)\n2022: Too Nobody (It's Normal to Shiver Version)\n2022: Misunderstood (It's Normal to Shiver Version)\n2023: pretty by night (from the Amazon Original Motion Picture \"Silver and the Book of Dreams\")\n2024: Like a Song\n\n\n== References ==",

There are over 1.5 million unique designs, which are shipped worldwide.\n\n\n== History ==\nDisplate was founded in 2013 by Karol Banaszkiewicz, Jacek Świgost, and Edward Ruszczyc. They wanted to create a new approach to art with a new way of printing and hanging it. The product was not an instant hit, and the trio had to print their plates in a small tin shed when they first started. However, they raised two million euros from Credo Ventures to expand their business. Displates began to rise in popularity in 2017, when they signed a licensing agreement with The Walt Disney Company, allowing them to use elements from the Star Wars and Marvel Comics franchises. Mid Europa Partners bought a majority stake in the company in 2020.\n\n\n== Products ==\nDisplates come with magnets, which are adhesive and stick to the wall easily. The metal posters are manufactured in two factories in Łódź and Marki. Displate allows artists to sell their works on their products and has collaborated with over 40,000 of them to do so. It also runs limited prints with enhanced versions of the posters with embellishments and varnishes, which sometimes become popular with collectors. In 2023, they introduced LUMINO, which contained small OLED lights that gave the Displate a glowing appearance. Textra posters, with textured surfaces, were first sold in 2024.\n\n\n== References ==",

It forms a white-colored anhydrous and a rose-colored hexahydrate, both of which are hygroscopic. As a perchlorate, it is a strong oxidizing agent.\n\n\n== Production and reactions ==\nThe hexahydrate can be produced by reacting manganese metal or manganese(II) carbonate with perchloric acid, followed by the evaporation of the solution. The hexahydrate does not dehydrate when heating but instead oxidizes to manganese dioxide at 150 °C.To produce the anhydrous form, manganese(II) nitrate is reacted with dichlorine hexoxide at 5 °C:\nMn(NO3)2 + 4 Cl2O6 → NO2Mn(ClO4)3 + NO2ClO4 + 4  ClO2 + O2The resulting nitryl salt is subsequently heated at 105 °C in a vacuum to produce the anhydrous perchlorate.\nNO2Mn(ClO4)3 → Mn(ClO4)2 + NO2ClO4\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe anhydrous form is predicted to be isostructural with cobalt(II) perchlorate, based on the IR spectrum and the Raman spectrum of the compound.The hexahydrate consists of discreet [Mn(H2O)6]2+ octahedrons and perchlorate anions with lattice constants a = 7.85 Å, b = 13.60 Å and c = 5.30 Å. The hexahydrate undergoes phase transitions at low temperatures.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Muhammad ibn al-Sabbagh (fl. 1640), also known as Dan Marina, was a 17th-century Islamic scholar from Katsina. He is regarded as one of the three patron saints of Katsina, alongside Dan Masanih, and Dan Tukum. Even today, Muslims, primarily from Katsina, continue to pilgrimage to his tomb for ziyara. In the1820s, the Sokoto scholar Abd al-Qadir dan Tafa visited his tomb for ziyara while in his 1812 work Infaq al-maysur, Muhammad Bello, first Sultan of the Sokoto Caliphate, described him as al-ustadh ('the teacher'), al-mukashaf ('the one illuminated') and dihliz al-ilm ('the hall-way of learning'). His most well known work is his commentary of the book Ishriniyyat written by Abdul Rahman bn Yakhftan al-Fazazi.: 111 : 145 : 619 \n\n\n== Life ==\nDan Marina's father, an Arab who migrated to Kano from 'the east', was hosted by a dyer named Kayaba. His mother was the daughter of Sarkin Katsina Mahmud.: 31 \nLittle is known about Dan Marina's early life. According to a local legend in Katsina, his mother passed away during childbirth and was interred before his birth. After her burial, he was said to have 'emerged' from the grave. Several nights later, the owner of some dye pits in the area observed the indigo from his splattered around the ground for consecutive nights. Determined to apprehend the perpetrator, he stayed awake for one night and discovered it was a young Dan Marina playing around the pits before slipping away. Following the baby, the dyer found him sleeping beside his mother's grave in the graveyard. The dyer then took him in and raised him as part of his own family.: 57 \nDuring the mid 17th-century, a Muslim intelligentsia (mallamai) formed in Katsina which held considerable influence in Birnin Katsina and other urban centres. Among the influential mallamai was Dan Marina who lived in the Marina quarter of Birnin Katsina.: 27  He was an active scholar and produced a number of works, with his most important being his commentary of the Ishriniyyat of Abdul Rahman bn Yakhftan al-Fazazi. Another important work of his was a poem he composed to celebrate the victory of Bornu under the leadership of Mai Ali against Kwararafa.: 22 : 132  This poem is one of the earliest pieces of Hausa literature composed in Arabic.: 308 \nThe burial site of Dan Marina is one of Katsina state's most prominent graveyards, with many who revere him as a wali (saint) choosing to be buried close to him. Among those interred there are notable figures such as musicians, Islamic scholars, and politicians, including Umaru Yar'Adua, Nigeria's 13th President, alongside his brother General Shehu Yar'Adua, and their father Musa Yar'Adua.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Second Battle of Bolimów was a battle of World War I between the Imperial German Army and Imperial Russian Army. The Germans successfully used poison gases, causing panic in the ranks of the Imperial Russian Army and inflicting huge casualties on it at the cost of negligible casualties of their own.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn the spring of 1915, the German command, after the end of the Battle of Łódź, having seized the strategic initiative, planned to deliver a powerful blow to the troops of the Russian Southwestern Front in the space between the Vistula River and the Carpathian Mountains, break through the front and, continuing the offensive, create a threat to communications and rear areas Russian armies in Poland. Based on the developed plan, by the end of April 1915, the German command concentrated a powerful group of its troops in the direction of the main attack in the Gorlice ledge area and on May 2 began an attack on Russian positions.\nSimultaneously with the large-scale offensive near Gorlice, in other sectors of the Eastern Front, the German command planned a number of smaller offensive operations that pursued their strategic goals and solved their operational problems. One of these areas where the offensive was planned was the Bolimów sector. The “sector” arose in December 1914 – January 1915. Then the German command set a priority task for its troops: to defeat  parts of the 2nd Russian Army in the Warsaw direction in the area of the lower reaches of the Rawka River, and, having entered the operational space, create an immediate threat of the capture of Warsaw, to which no more than 60 kilometers remained from these positions in a straight line. During the bloody and stubborn battles, the Germans failed to break through the front, but they still managed to break into the Russian defense, and, having captured bridgeheads on the right bank of the Rawka River in the Bolimów area, gain a foothold on them, this is how the “Bolimów sector” arose. During the January battles of 1915, the German command used chemical weapons on a large scale for the first time in the “sector,” dropping 18,000 shells filled with the irritating chemical xylyl bromide on Russian positions near Gumin and Wola Szydłowska on January 31, 1915.\nThe strategic importance of the “Bolimów sector” for both warring parties was obvious. From the positions captured by the Germans on the Rawka River, the shortest route to Warsaw opened up. In general, the operational situation that developed in this sector of the front fully corresponded to the strategic plan of the command of the 9th German Army, to conduct a decisive attack on Warsaw here. However, despite all the obvious tactical and operational benefits, it was extremely difficult for German troops to make a breakthrough in the Bolimów sector, because the Russian command, understanding the threat of a breakthrough in this direction, saturated this section of the front with troops, and also during the winter and spring 1915 created and continued to create fortified positions throughout the entire depth of the operational defense, which extended far to the east and ended at Błonie, 15-20 kilometers and at Piaseczno, 5-8 kilometers west and southwest of Warsaw. The task of breaking through the Russian defense in the “Bolimów sector” for the 9th German Army was made even more difficult due to the transfer of reserves from its composition to Gorlice and East Prussia, which weakened the striking power of the army. And yet, the commander of the 9th Army, Prince Leopold of Bavaria, having at his disposal 2 ½ army corps, decided to strike in the “Bolimów sector”, break through the front and, crushing the Russian's defenses, continue the offensive with the goal of capturing Warsaw. The striking power of the missing divisions, according to the commander of the 9th German Army, should have been replaced by chemical weapons - chlorine. However, subsequent events showed that the numerical superiority of the Russians negated the success of the use of poison gases.\nThe deadly power of chlorine was supposed to destroy not only large masses of Russian manpower, but also solve other equally important and primary tasks, namely, to stun and demoralize the Russian imperial army, to suppress its will to resist. Therefore, the command of the 9th German Army believed that it had concentrated sufficient forces in the zone of the upcoming breakthrough that would be able to break into the defense of the 2nd Russian Army, weakened by human losses, after the use of gas.\n\n\n== Preparation for battle ==\nBased on the established concept of the planned operation, at the beginning of May 1915, the German command transferred the 36th Pioneer Regiment to positions near Bolimov. This was a special unit trained to carry out gas attacks. On May 18, 1915, the regiment began installing gas cylinders in forward positions. A total of 12,000 cylinders filled with chlorine with a 5% phosgene composition were delivered. Due to the huge number of cylinders and due to the short preparation time for the attack, soldiers of the infantry regiments helped install the cylinders. The cylinders were placed on a 12-kilometer section of the front in the trenches of the 36th, 35th Infantry and 49th Reserve Divisions of the German Imperial Army, which occupied positions from the confluence of the Sukha River into the Bzura River in the north, where the village of Zakrzew was located, and further south along broken line: Zakrzew –  Borzymów – Gumin – Wola Szydłowiecka – forester's house. Starting from Bzura and further south, the trenches were occupied by the following German units, in the Zakrzew - Gumin sector: 2nd battalion of the 48th reserve infantry regiment, 1st battalion of the 52nd reserve infantry regiment, 175th infantry regiment, 5th Grenadier Regiment, 128th Infantry Regiment, 61st Infantry Regiment, 176th Infantry Regiment. South of Gumin: 226th Reserve Infantry Regiment, 225th Reserve Infantry Regiment, 21st Reserve Rifle Battalion and 228th Reserve Infantry Regiment.\nIn this sector, the 2nd Army held the defense on the Russian side. From Zakrzhev to Gumin these were units of the 14th Siberian Rifle Division from the VI Siberian Corps: from north to south, the positions were occupied by the 55th and 53rd Siberian Rifle Regiments. The remaining two regiments of the division were in reserve: the 56th Siberian Rifle Regiment (divisional reserve), the 54th Siberian Rifle Regiment (army reserve). South of Gumin the defense was held by the 55th Infantry Division from the XXXV Army Corps. From north to south, the 217th Kovrovsky was located there and the 218th Gorbatovsky infantry regiment. To the south of the forester's house, the defense was held by the 220th Skopinsky Infantry Regiment with three militia squads attached to it. During the chemical attack carried out by the Germans on May 31, the squads found themselves, in fact, outside the affected area of the poisonous gases. By May 22, all cylinders filled with chlorine were installed at the forward positions of the German troops and were ready for use. The start of the gas attack was planned for May 23, but the wind did not blow on the positions of the Russian army, and in anticipation of a change in wind direction, the attack was postponed to May 31, 1915.\n\n\n== First battle May 31, 1915 ==\nAt 3:30 a.m. on May 31, 1915, in the German frontline trenches, in which there were 12,000 cylinders of lethal gas, the telephone rang and a voice was heard on the receiver that said only one word: “Wittelsbach”. This was a prearranged signal for the start of the gas attack. At 3:45 am, soldiers of the 36th Pioneer Regiment of the German Army opened the taps in chlorine cylinders. At the same time, shelling of Russian positions began with artillery, machine guns and small arms. The chlorine was carried by the wind to Russian positions, which were defended by units of the 14th Siberian Rifle Division (VIth Siberian Corps) and the 55th Infantry Division (XXXV Army Corps). During the gas attack, the Germans failed to break through the front. Although the Russian units suffered critical losses from chlorine poisoning, they still managed, with the help of arriving reserves, to repel numerous German attacks.\nDuring the chemical attack on May 31, German soldiers were also poisoned with chlorine. In the 225th Reserve Infantry Regiment, when opening the valves, it turned out that some of the cylinders had a technological defect: there was no seal in the connection between the cylinder itself and the socket attached to it. As soon as the soldiers of the 36th Pioneer Regiment began to open the valves of the cylinders to release the chlorine, the gas began to flow from the depressurized joints and quickly spread throughout the trenches. Several cylinders fell, dragging into the trench and spouts from which clouds of chlorine poured out. In total, during the chemical attack on May 31, 1915, 56 German soldiers were poisoned. The Germans' total losses during the battle amounted to 374 men.\nRussian losses were enormous, almost 30 times more than German. 1,474 men died from exposure to gas, 245 men were killed in battle, 9,092 men were wounded and poisoned, 45 were missing. A total of 10,856.\n\n\n== Second battle June 12, 1915 ==\nOn the night of June 12, Prince Leopold of Bavaria ordered a repeat gas attack. Preparations were reduced as Russian troops launched nightly attacks to recapture lost sections of the position, but the number of heavy batteries increased to 24. The release of gas followed an hour's artillery preparation at 3.30. but a changing wind carried the cloud to the German trenches. The launch was cancelled, only 4,500 cylinders were emptied. The infantry attack was launched at 5 o'clock; by 8 o'clock the Russian positions were in the villages: Zakrzhev, Kornelin, Zhilin and Kozlov-Biskupy were captured, the Germans entrenched themselves on the embankment of the Warsaw-Vienna Railway and on June 12–13 held the occupied space, repelling all counterattacks. \n\nThe Germans captured 1,600 prisoners and 8 machine guns; in a 6 km area the breakthrough in depth reached 2–3 km. Despite the supply of German soldiers with protective bandages and decontamination solutions, German losses by poisoning reached 350 men (out of a total loss of 1,100). The 175th Infantry Regiment suffered especially (149 poisoned and 6 dead). Russian troops at the line of attack lost 327 killed, 2,571 missing, 2,923 wounded, that is, again many times more than the attacking Germans. The physical impact of the gases was not as great as during the first attack (50 men died, 19 officers and 2,359 soldiers were poisoned), but the psychological effect exceeded the German's expectations: Russian soldiers abandoned part of the position and fled at the sight of the gas cloud.\n\n\n== Third battle July,6-7 1915 ==\nThe headquarters of the 9th German Army began preparations for a new chemical attack. But this time, Russian troops took countermeasures, striking at night at enemy positions where gas launchers could be located. However, 3,000 gas cylinders were buried in the 8th and 12th Reserve Infantry Regiments' sectors. Unfavorable weather on the nights of June 17 and 19 prevented the Germans from carrying out new chemical attacks. Two sections were planned: from the village of Leonov to the mouth of the Pisya River and at Borzhimov. On July 6, the gases were launched only at Borzhimov; the wind changed from east to north, and the gas cloud not only lingered in the trenches captured by the Germans, but also penetrated the positions of the 5th reserve division, forcing it to retreat to Zakrzhev\nSignificant losses in the regiments that were subjected to a gas attack on the night of July 6–7, as well as the abandonment of their positions by the companies of the 21st Siberian and 218th Gorbatovsky regiments during the passage of the gas wave, forced the command of the 2nd Army to throw not only reserves into the resulting gap from the XXXV Corps, but also parts of neighboring formations. As a result, battalions of the 117th Yaroslavl Infantry and 120th Serpukhov Infantry Regiments from the 30th Infantry Division of the IV Army Corps, which temporarily became subordinate to the XXXV Corps, took part in eliminating the resulting breakthrough, together with the 220th Skopinsky Regiment. Some of the personnel of these regiments also suffered from gas poisoning.\n\nDuring the gas attack carried out by the Germans on the night of July 6–7, 1915, the losses of the Russian army from gas poisoning in absolute numbers amounted to 10,104 men, of which 1,775 men died. With the help of chlorine, the Germans managed to immediately disable more than 10,000 personnel. These were huge losses. In his report on the use of gas by the Germans, the commander of the 21st Siberian Rifle Regiment pointed out this aspect of the use of chemical weapons: “Losses from gases are so colossal that no active actions in the fight against the enemy can entail such a mass of those who are out of action.”\n\n\n== Outcome ==\nThe psychological effect of the use of chemical weapons on the personnel and command of units of the Russian army was enormous. \nThe head of the “Commission to clarify the conditions of the use of asphyxiating gases by the Germans on the night of June 23–24 of this year in the area where the 5th Siberian and 35th Army Corps were located and the results of their use,” Major General Pavlov wrote: “I consider it my duty to report that the highest The commanding staff of the 5th Siberian Corps and the 35th Army Corps verbally and in written explanations, as well as all the officers of the 21st Siberian Rifle and 218th Gorbatov Infantry Regiments, expressed to me and the members of the commission in the most categorical form that\na) moral the effect of poisonous gases on our troops, in the absence of the same measures of influence on our part, is extremely strong; how truly was the stunning impression of defenselessness, the impossibility of either resistance or struggle and the useless death of people - can be illustrated by the fact, certified by the commander of the 21st Siberian Rifle Regiment, the suicide in the trenches of two company commanders: the 14th company of Khlopitsky and the 15th company of Kardopoltsev; the proven courage and valor of the officers of this regiment were known and proven in previous battles, therefore the suicide of such officers can only be explained by unbearable mental and partly physical suffering;\nb) if the sacrifices of thousands of lives made on our part remain unpunished for the Germans and there is no retribution for them with the same weapons and our defenselessness continues, then this could have a detrimental effect on the spirit of our troops and even lead to their demoralization, and\nc) the use of poisonous gases from our side will be accepted with delight by everyone, and even if we have losses from enemy gases, they will be considered the inevitable consequences of battle, as from rifle and machine-gun fire, where both sides use the same weapons; Therefore, our use of gases is extremely necessary, but under the indispensable condition that their quantity and effect are by no means weaker than German gases.”\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hospital of the Transfiguration is a Polish psychological war film from 1978 directed by Edward Żebrowski, based on Stanisław Lem's 1955 novel of the same title. The film's theme revolves around the extermination of patients in a psychiatric hospital shortly after the outbreak of World War II (Aktion T4). The story focuses on the character of Dr. Stefan (played by Piotr Dejmek), who dares to protest against unethical experiments conducted on patients by the hospital staff even before the arrival of the Germans. The film was mostly well received by critics and won multiple awards, including at the Polish Film Festival and the Locarno Film Festival. Its strengths were praised for its aesthetic quality and insightful analysis of the reasons for acquiescence to totalitarianism, while its weakness was seen in deviating from wartime realities in favor of an idiosyncratic stylization.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe action of the film begins in late 1939 when young doctor Stefan arrives at a closed psychiatric hospital to take up a job there. Stefan, who adheres to humanitarian principles but is vague in his views, is accepted by the hospital director, Dr. Pajączkowski. He then gains experience under the supervision of the cynical Dr. Rygier, who does not hide his pro-Nazi views. Stefan disapproves of Rygier's behavior, who subjects patients to humiliating experimental treatment methods, including electroconvulsive therapy. Rygier performs surgery on Andrzej, a brain cancer patient, resulting in the patient almost losing his mental faculties. Stefan also notices the obsessions of other doctors: Dr. Kauters prefers exclusively surgical methods of treatment, while Dr. Marglewski sees mental illness solely as a manifestation of possession.\nSoon, an SS officer named Thiesdorf arrives at the hospital, announcing the liquidation of the psychiatric hospital. Thiesdorf's visit provokes various reactions among the hospital staff. Over time, Stefan rebels more and more against Rygier, but he cannot count on Pajączkowski's support, as Rygier accuses him of having a \"Masonic\" scientific background before the occupation. Pajączkowski admonishes Stefan that he must prioritize not harming the patients over showing them mercy. Meanwhile, the drug-addicted writer Sekułowski, seeking refuge in the hospital, bitterly accuses the young doctor of lacking life experience. Meanwhile, Dr. Nosilewska secretly confesses to Stefan that she fled from Austria after it was occupied by the Nazis. Stefan realizes the futility of his idealism but also witnesses the medical mistakes of his older colleagues: Kauters's failed surgery and Marglewski's charlatanism.\nThe moment of the hospital's liquidation arrives. The helpless director Pajączkowski cannot obtain consent from Rygier, Kauters, and Marglewski for a spontaneous action to save the patients. Only Stefan supports him, distributing the remaining medicines to the patients and, at Sekułowski's request, adding cyanide to his drink; the files are also burned. When the Germans enter the hospital grounds, they arrest part of the staff; Nosilewska is arrested as a Jew, and Pajączkowski shares her fate. Sekułowski, trying to resist arrest, takes cyanide and commits suicide. The SS officers lead the staff and patients of the hospital out of the building to execute them. Stefan, hiding from the Germans, tries to rescue a young boy hidden under hospital gowns, but the boy dies in his arms. Seeing an SS patrol in the forest, Stefan attempts to flee and disappears into the fog, while the execution squad shoots the patients and remaining staff, burying them afterwards.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\nSource: Online Polish Film Database\n\nPiotr Dejmek – Doctor Stefan\nJerzy Bińczycki – engineer Andrzej Nowacki, hospital patient\nHenryk Bista – Doctor Kauters\nEwa Dałkowska – Doctor Nosilewska\nGustaw Holoubek – writer Zygmunt Sekułowski\nZygmunt Hübner – Doctor Pajączkowski, hospital director\nRyszard Kotys – Nurse Józef\nWojciech Pszoniak – Doctor Marglewski\nZbigniew Zapasiewicz – Doctor Rygier\nWładysław Kowalski – hospital patient\nElżbieta Karkoszka – hospital patient\nMarcin Troński – Doctor Kozłowski\n\n\n== Production ==\n\nThe production of the Hospital of the Transfiguration was managed by the Tor Studio under the artistic direction of Krzysztof Zanussi. The film was directed by Edward Żebrowski, who co-wrote the screenplay based on Stanisław Lem's novel of the same title with film critic Michał Komar (this was the first screenplay co-created by the latter). Witold Sobociński was responsible for the cinematography, while Tadeusz Wybult designed the set. The music for the Hospital of the Transfiguration was composed by Stanisław Radwan, and Małgorzata Jaworska was in charge of the sound editing. The film was edited by Urszula Śliwińska.\nEdward Żebrowski aimed his criticism in the film towards the institution of the psychiatric hospital, which employs a system of violence. By focusing on the moral dilemmas of Dr. Stefan, which lead the main character to a heroic act in the name of good, Żebrowski attempted to simultaneously explore the phenomenon of good in a world permeated by evil.\nDuring the film's production, historic interiors and locations of the Tworkowski Hospital near Warsaw were used. Interestingly, this was the only major psychiatric hospital in Poland where the mentally ill were not exterminated by the Germans during the war. The premiere of the Hospital of the Transfiguration took place on 28 March 1979.\n\n\n=== Distribution ===\nIn 2011, the Hospital of the Transfiguration was released together with other films by Żebrowski – Ocalenie (1972) and W biały dzień (1980) – on DVD discs as part of the publishing series Arcydzieła polskiego kina. The release of the Hospital of the Transfiguration was handled by Kino Polska Television, and the distributed version featured Dolby Digital 2.0 sound standard. A digitally reconstructed version of Żebrowski's film was released in 2017 by Tor Studio and Blu Studio, available on both DVD and Blu-ray discs.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nThe Hospital of the Transfiguration was mostly positively received by critics. Krzysztof Kreutzinger, writing for the magazine Film, stated that The Holocaust, although coming from outside, is somehow a consequence of internal relations. There is no significant opposition felt between the perversion within the hospital itself and the impending cruelty. Rafał Marszałek emphasized that Żebrowski discovered the primordial sources of social disease [...] as if beyond Nazism, at least before the extermination planned by the Nazis took place. Marszałek also noted that the film's doctors for a long time feel like masters of life and death of patients, unwittingly laying the groundwork for Nazi extermination. Similarly, Tadeusz Sobolewski wrote that \"Hospital of the Transfiguration\" shows with corrosive irony that the epidemic of fascism spread also on our side. Among the hospital staff are spiritual Nazis. According to Zygmunt Kałużyński from Polityka, Żebrowski's film fulfills a hugely important need: it presents attitudes, provokes clashes of views, engages us in the drama of ideological contradictions.\nMore skeptical about the Hospital of the Transfiguration was Tadeusz Lubelski, accusing the film of having an implausible plot. The film's liquidation of the hospital takes place in the summer of 1940, whereas, as Lubelski claimed, the prototype events took place in Lviv, where Lem began his medical studies in 1940; the Germans could only arrive at the hospital two years after the war began. The author of the literary prototype, Stanisław Lem, accused Żebrowski of departing from the wartime reality: even during World War II, the commander of a German unit could not, just like that, murder anyone. Most likely, the Germans would have killed the patients, but not the doctors, who had a chance of survival. Similar criticism was made by Jerzy Płażewski in Kino, reproaching the director for isolating the hospital story from the broader context of the occupation. Krzysztof Kłopotowski from Literatura stated that \"Hospital of the Transfiguration\" uses schematic simplifications: the supporter of experimenting on people turns out to be a Volksdeutsche at a critical moment. At the time, it was a valid observation, but today it is misleading.\nHowever, the aesthetic merits of the film were not questioned. Krzysztof Teodor Toeplitz from Miesięcznik Literacki wrote: The film is beautifully shot, its images have realism but also style awareness. In terms of staging, it is undoubtedly a great step forward in the development of Edward Żebrowski's talent. Jan Józef Szczepański from Tygodnik Powszechny pointed out the cinematographic craftsmanship responsible for the cinematography, Witold Sobociński: The unexpected transition from color to black and white technique, the quietening of sound, the blurring of image sharpness, contributes to a general change in tonality, creates a different perspective – as if reality is viewed from a different, more objectified point of view. Szczepański summed up the discussion about Żebrowski's film as follows: \"Hospital of the Transfiguration\" is not only a great directorial success of Edward Żebrowski – it is also a film that undoubtedly will represent the most valuable achievements of Polish cinematography\".\n\n\n=== Years later ===\nAndrzej Szpulak approached the criticism of the film's schematic message from a more contemporary perspective. As Szpulak argued: Kauters, Rygier, Marglewski, or the writer Sekułowski are not wax figures representing their ideological attitudes, but fully-fleshed people with multifaceted personalities. According to Szpulak, the film benefited not only from the subtlety with which Żebrowski adapted Lem's prose but also from the cast of actors. It is largely thanks to their use that the director managed to avoid the risk of flattening the message. Szpulak, considering Żebrowski's entire body of work, emphasized the viewer's confrontation with situations that are difficult or even impossible to comprehend and experience at any moment and for every person, a confrontation devoid of the facilitations associated with the use of conventions or illustrative elements related to some worldview concept. In Szpulak's opinion, the portrayal of a borderline situation in a person's life takes on a nuanced form in the Hospital of the Transfiguration: There is no trace of the beauty of decay or the pornography of violence.\nOn the other hand, Robert Birkholc considered Lem's criticisms regarding the depiction of wartime realities in the film as not particularly significant because the Hospital of the Transfiguration is not a faithful reconstruction of the Aktion T4 [...], but a symbolic film presenting a bitter diagnosis of European culture. Birkholc also emphasized that: The excellent acting, biting humor, naturalistic scenery, and feverish (in the most dramatic moments of the story) camera work directed by Witold Sobociński make Żebrowski's work one of the best and most suggestive adaptations of Lem's prose.\n\n\n== Rewards ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGajewska, Agnieszka (2016).

        "content": "Péter Schumann (24 April 1954 – 5 April 2024) was a Hungarian footballer. He played as a midfielder who was most recognized for his career within Dózsa Újpest during the late 1970s, when the club won three honours within the Nemzeti Bajnokság I.\n\n\n== Club career ==\nSchumann began his football career by playing for Vasas Izzó at the age of eight. His uncle Béla Konkoly later scouted and convinced him to play for Dózsa Újpest for the remainder of his youth career. He made his senior debut and first goal for the club on 22 February 1975 in a 4–2 defeat against Pécs. Schumann later played for Pécs on loan for the 1975–76 Nemzeti Bajnokság II before returning to play for Újpest until the 1979–80 Nemzeti Bajnokság I. During his time with Újpest, he oversaw the club winning three titles as well as being runners-up in two editions of the tournament. He then played for Váci Izzó for the 1980–81 Nemzeti Bajnokság II. The final club he played for was Tatabányai Bányász after he was scouted by the club's manager Károly Lakat. Schumann was repeatedly injured during his final season despite only playing in four matches which were his main citation in his retirement. He ended his career in a 4–0 victory over Budapest Honvéd.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nPéter Schumann's father János Schumann was also a professional football player, playing for Dózsa Újpest but the family soon relocated to Budapest after World War II. Despite this though, Péter stated that his father's career was not the primary source of inspiration for him to pick up football as it came from playing the sport with other family members. He was also classmates with fellow footballer György Gálhidi at school.\nFollowing his football career, fellow footballer Lali Buza convinced him to become a parking attendant where he remained employed at various locations for the next fifteen years. Around this time, Schumann was married and had a daughter, but he and his wife were later divorced. Former Újpest footballer Gyula Bánka later gave Schumann another job opportunity at his injection moulding shop in 2000. In 2003, while playing a game of football, he broke his left foot. Initially, he treated the wound but with persistent pain, he eventually checked himself at Újpesti Szakorvosi Rendelőintézet Budapest where he was later diagnosed with severe vasoconstriction and his foot was amputated due to no signs of life within the blood vessels. Schumann continued working with an artificial limb until his other leg also began experiencing similar symptoms. From 2014, Schumann was bound in a wheelchair and would later visit his grandson of one year old. Despite some newspapers describing Schumann as being suicidal over his life circumstances, he denied these claims, maintaining an optimistic outlook. He also maintained a friendship with Ede Dunai who wrote a biographical novel about Schumann titled Egy megcsonkított élet. In 2023, Schumann made a guest appearance at Újpest TV. Prior to his death on 5 April 2024, Schumann was set to meet his newly born granddaughter for the first time according to Dunai.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was founded in 1991 and currently has 144 stores across Taiwan.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn Taiwan in the 1960s and 1970s, the clothing industry was booming, and many garments were manufactured in Taiwan. However, as the volume of garments increased, some garments did not meet the requirements of foreign original manufacturers, or the garments had defects or transportation delays. However, Taiwanese OEMs must face the pressure of inventory accumulation due to returns from foreign original manufacturers. The Housewives Shopping Mall mainly sells ready-made clothing for export. In order to solve the problem of insufficient supply, it began to invest in a business model focusing on self-developed products and designed clothing.In October 1991, Taiwan's first self-created clothing brand NET was established in Housewives Mall.In 1993, Housewives Mall opened its first flagship store on Nanjing East Road, Taipei City.\nIn 1996, the Housewife Shopping Mall was renamed Jia Fang Clothing Co., Ltd. (J-fun Corp.).\nIn 1997, Jia Fang Clothing entered the information industry and established the large-scale information store \"T.T. Station Information Plaza\" on the first floor and first basement floor (Shude Building) of No. 36, Section 1, Zhongxiao West Road, Zhongzheng District, Taipei City.\nIn 2008, Jiafang Fashion was renamed Ju Fu Fashion Development Corp.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLativ\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNet Official Website\nTaiwan Company Information\nNET on Facebook\nNET on Instagram",

        "content": "Red Fraggle is a fictional character in Jim Henson's television series Fraggle Rock, as well as its reboot Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock. She is one of the five main characters from the series, alongside Gobo, Wembley, Mokey, and Boober. She was performed and voiced by Karen Prell in both the original series and its reboot; Barbara Goodson voiced her in the animated series.\nRed is the best friend and roommate of Mokey Fraggle. She is adventurous, fun-loving, cheerful, and athletic. She is a fan of sports and loves to swim in the Fraggle pool. She can be highly competitive with her friends, and has something of a rivalry with her friend Gobo, as well as strongly disliking Gobo's uncle Traveling Matt. She also dislikes Mokey's pet plant Lanford, though she warms up to him later.\nRed has proved to be one of the most popular characters from Fraggle Rock. Karen Prell has made live appearances with Red at various events. Red returned, performed once again by Prell, in the short-form Apple TV+ series Fraggle Rock: Rock On.\n\n\n== Development ==\nRed, along with the other Fraggles, was conceived and developed by series creator Jim Henson. The Red puppet was designed by Michael K. Frith and built by Rollie Krewson. Red's name is a reference to a \"redhead\", another name for an 800w film light.\n\n\n== Appearances ==\nRed appears as one of the five main characters from the original Fraggle Rock series and its reboot Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock. She also appears in the short Apple TV+ series Fraggle Rock: Rock On!. She is also seen, along with the other Fraggles, in the 1987 TV special A Muppet Family Christmas. In between the original series and its reboot, Red made several live appearance at conventions, and she also appeared in promos for The Hub's \"Fraggle Rock-a-Thon\" in 2013.\n\n\n== Behind the scenes ==\nRed is a rod puppet, which means that her arms are controlled by rods attached to the puppet's hands.\nDuring the audition process for the original series, Kathryn Mullen auditioned to play Red, but she was instead cast to play Mokey. Karen Prell was cast as Red, and has portrayed her ever since. Prell returned to play Red on Back to the Rock, where she was also attached as an executive producer.\n\n\n== References ==",

The name \"Ben Attar\" means \"spice seller.\"\nHe learned Torah from the Meshulachim Rabbi Chiya Dayan and Rabbi Elisha Chaim Ashkenazi..He was known for his diligence and he devoted even the short summer nights to Torah study. He used to rise every night and tearfully recite Tikkun Chatzot.He was known for hosting Torah scholars and his house was considered a gathering place for rabbis. \nIn 1705, his brother and business partner Shem Tov ben Attar passed away, so he traveled with his son Rabbi Moshe and his grandson Rabbi Chaim to the city of Meknes, to supervise the business, along with his brother's children. However, according to Rubenstein, the family was forced to flee due to the persecution of the Jews by the local vizier.\nHe remained in Meknes for two and a half years, staying with the Nagid Rabbi Moshe De Avila.\nAmong his students were his grandson, Rabbi Chaim ibn Attar, Shmuel de Avila, the son-in-law of his son Rabbi Moshe, and the son of Rabbi Moshe de Avila, and Shalom Buzaglo.\nSome of his teachings are cited in the writings of Moroccan rabbis. These were collected in the book \"Iggrot Hamasa Lerabbeinu Chaim ibn Attar\".\nHe lived a long time, probably more than a hundred years, and died in the year 1720. Rabbi Moshe Berdugo wrote a sermon that he gave as a eulogy.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mitsuki Nakamura (中村 光毅, Nakamura Mitsuki) (April 7, 1944 – May 16, 2011) was an art director and mecha designer in the Japanese anime industry.\nAfter working for Toei Doga, he joined Tatsunoko Productions, where he drew background art and designed mecha, supporting the first Tatsunoko golden age.\nAfter leaving Tatsunoko, he founded Design Office Mecaman and served as its representative director.\n\n\n== Style ==\nNakamura worked as art director on a number of anime works and has likewise worked as a mechanical designer.\nHe is one of the pioneering mecha designers in the Japanese anime industry and was the first to have his name included in the end credits.\nHis best-known works as a mecha designer include Mach Five from Speed Racer, God Phoenix from Science Ninja Team Gatchaman and Time Mechabuton from Time Bokan.\nMach Five, in particular, is regarded as a masterpiece of the first Tatsunoko golden age for its outstanding design sense, and its design was so perfect that it was used almost unchanged in the 2008 live-action film Speed Racer by The Wachowskis, 40 years later.\nHowever, his speciality was not mecha design, but anime background art.\nBackground art plays a very important role in Japanese-style animation expression techniques. This has become increasingly the case in recent years, and Nakamura's art was one of the factors to move in this direction.\nHis representative works as an art director include Science Ninja Team Gatchaman, Mobile Suit Gundam, and Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter graduating from junior high school, Nakamura joined Toei Doga through the help of his school teacher.\nHe gained experience in various jobs as an assistant and then as a member of the colouring staff, where he developed his knowledge of paints and colours.\nNakamura, who wanted to paint background art, moved to the newly established Tatsunoko Productions in 1964 through an introduction from Toei.\nAfter working on the studio's first TV series Space Ace, his love of cars led him to design cars for the studio's second work, the car racing anime series Speed Racer.\nHe became head of the art section, where he instructs Yoshitaka Amano and Kunio Okawara.\nAt that time, Tatsunoko's art section was not only responsible for art, but also for the design of backgrounds, props, robots and cars, all of which were entrusted to Nakamura, who was trusted by the president, Tatsuo Yoshida.\nThe staff included many aspiring painters who had left art college, some working for a living and some with personalities of their own, and he had to lead them as section head. With the number of animations even increasing, it was impossible for him to do everything on his own.\nHe therefore decided to entrust some of the mechanical design work to Okawara, who had just joined Tatsunoko.\nNakamura and Okawara were credited as mechanical designers for the first time in Japanese animation history in Science Ninja Team Gatchaman, which began airing in 1972.\nAt the end of 1976, he left Tatsunoko Productions and founded Design Office Mecaman with Kunio Okawara.\nInitially, Mecaman was planned to be a mecha design company, as Okawara was also a member of the company. However, he soon became independent and the company specialised in background art.\nNakamura died of oral cancer on May 16, 2011, at the age of 67.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n== Notes and References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== References ===",

It is part of the Bolsheareshevsky rural settlement.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe settlement is located on the bank of the Kuruterek canal, 9 km southeast of the center of the rural settlement - Bolshaya Areshevka and 32 km northeast of the city of Kizlyar.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe village was founded in 1927 to provide land for land-poor peasants from Mountain Jews. The Larinsky village council was created, consisting of two settlers named after Shchors (now renamed Kalinin) and later renamed Larinskoye (currently does not exist). The socio-cultural disorder of the village, as well as the lack of water in it, led to the fact that most of the population subsequently left it. In 1929, Mountain Jews moved to the village of Aglobi, to state farms in the city of Derbent, and 50 Russia Germans families moved into the village. They organized the \"Landbauer\" collective farm in the village.\n\n\n== Population ==\nAccording to the 2010 Russian census, 87 people lived in the village (48 men and 39 women).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===",

The two-night event will begin with the April 26 episode of Friday Night SmackDown (in Cincinnati, Ohio) and will conclude with the April 29 episode of Monday Night Raw (in Kansas City, Missouri), with SmackDown airing on Fox and Raw on the USA Network. This will also be the first draft with WWE under TKO Group Holdings.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nThe WWE Draft is a process used by the American professional wrestling promotion WWE while a brand extension, or brand split, is in effect. The original brand extension occurred from 2002 to 2011, while the second and current brand split began in 2016. During a brand extension, the company divides its roster into what they call brands and wrestlers exclusively perform for each brand's respective television show, albeit with some exceptions. The draft is used to refresh the rosters of the brand divisions, typically between the Raw and SmackDown brands, which are regarded as the main roster. Since 2016, wrestlers from WWE's developmental brand, NXT, have been eligible to be drafted to either Raw or SmackDown. This is will be the first WWE draft were wrestlers from RAW and SmackDown will eligible to be drafted to NXT\nDuring an appearance on WWE wrestler Logan Paul's podcast Impaulsive on April 5, 2024, WWE Chief Content Officer Triple H revealed that the 2024 draft was imminent. Just three days later on April 8, the draft was confirmed for the April 26 and April 29 episodes of Friday Night SmackDown on Fox and Monday Night Raw on the USA Network, respectively.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ourisia caespitosa, or creeping mountain foxglove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Plantaginaceae that is endemic to New Zealand. Joseph Dalton Hooker described O. caespitosa in 1853. Plants of this species of New Zealand foxglove are perennial herbs that are mostly glabrous (hairless), with trilobed or irregularly notched leaves that are tightly packed along a creeping stem. It is listed as Not Threatened.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nOurisia caespitosa Hook.f. is in the plant family Plantaginaceae. Joseph Dalton Hooker described O. caespitosa in Volume II of his Flora Antarctica series, Flora Novae-Zelandiae 1853. It is known as creeping mountain foxglove.\nThe type material was collected by William Colenso in the Ruahine Range of the North Island, and by David Lyall in Milford Sound, South Island, New Zealand. The lectotype was designated by Heidi Meudt and is housed at the herbarium of the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew. Although O. caespitosa var. gracilis was described by Joseph Hooker in 1867, it was considered to be a synonym of O. caespitosa in the latest taxonomic treatment.\nOurisia caespitosa can be distinguished from all other New Zealand species of Ourisia by its mostly glabrous aspect, trilobed or irregularly notched leaves that are tightly packed along the creeping stem.\nOurisia caespitosa is morphologically most similar to another New Zealand species, O. glandulosa. It can be distinguished from that species by its hairless leaves (vs. leaves sparsely to densely hairy on the upper side) and the three lines of yellow hairs inside the corolla tube (vs. glabrous inside the tube).\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nOurisia caespitosa plants are perennial herbs. The stems are creeping, many-branched, and densely packed with repent, opposite leaves. Leaf petioles are 0.8–9.4 mm long. Leaf blades are 1.9–9.4 mm long by 1.1–6.3 mm wide (length: width ratio 1.2–2.0: 1), usually narrowly to broadly ovate or obovate, widest below or above the middle, with a rounded apex, cuneate base, and trilobed or with up to 4 irregular notches or teeth. Leaves mostly glabrous, and on the lower surface densely punctate. Inflorescences are erect, glabrous racemes up to 125 mm long, with 1–3 flowering nodes and up to 6 total flowers per raceme. Each flowering node 1–2 flowers and 2 sessile, clasping bracts that are usually narrowly to broadly ovate or obovate. The lowest bracts are similar to the leaves, 3.1–8.2 mm long and 1.4–6.3 mm wide, and become smaller toward the tip of the raceme. The flowers are borne on a glabrous pedicel up to 32 mm long. The calyx is 4.3–7.4 mm long, irregular, with 3 lobes divided to about one-quarter the length of the calyx and 2 divided to near the base, and usually glabrous. The corolla is 11.3–19.3 mm long (including the 3.9–9.7 mm long corolla tube), white, bilabiate, tubular-funnelform, glabrous on the outside, with 3 lines of yellow hairs on the inside. The corolla lobes are 3.5–10.9 mm long, spreading, and obovate to obcordate. There are 4 stamens up to 8.3 mm long which are didynamous, with two long exserted stamens and 2 short stamens included inside the corolla; a short staminode up to 4 mm long is also present. The style is 4.4–7.6 mm long, exserted, with a capitate stigma. The ovary is 1.8–4.0 mm long and glabrous. Fruits are capsules 4.2–6.8 mm long and 2.6–4.8 mm wide with loculicidal dehiscence and pedicels up to 21.0 mm long. There are about 160 tiny seeds in each capsule, 0.6–1.0 mm long and 0.4–0.6 mm wide, rectangular, linear oblong or narrowly oblong with a two-layered, reticulate seed coat.\n\nOurisia caespitosa flowers from October to March and fruits from December to April. O. caespitosa was one of eight widespread species whose populations at higher elevations flower 3–5 weeks earlier than those at lower elevations in Cupola Basin, Nelson Lakes National Park.\nThe chromosome number of Ourisia caespitosa is 2n=48.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n\nOurisia caespitosa is a New Zealand foxglove that is endemic to the North, South and Stewart Islands of New Zealand. It is widespread and common in most high-elevation areas.\nIn the North Island it is found in the Gisborne, Volcanic Plateau and Southern North Island regions, whereas on the South Island it widespread throughout all regions. On Stewart Island, it is known from Mt Anglem | Hananui.\nIt grows in herbfields, grasslands and scrub above the bush line, often in damp places, on shingle, scree, rocks, crevices, outcrops and cliffs from 540 to 2000 m m above sea level.\n\n\n== Phylogeny ==\nIndividuals of O. caespitosa were included in phylogenetic analyses of all species of the genus Ourisia using standard DNA sequencing markers (two nuclear ribosomal DNA markers and two chloroplast DNA regions) and morphological data. In all analyses, the sampled individuals belonged to the highly supported New Zealand lineage, but in the nuclear ribosomal DNA dataset and combined analyses, only three of the four sampled individuals of O. caespitosa were monophyletic. Relationships between New Zealand species were nevertheless not well resolved.\nIn another phylogenetic study using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), all 49 sampled individuals formed a clade or a significant cluster the analyses, and there were three distinct geographical lineages within this cluster comprising individuals from 1) central North Island, 2) southern South Island and remaining North Island individuals, and 3) Otago, South Island.\n\n\n== Biology ==\nOurisia caespitosa was one of several New Zealand alpine flowering plants used in field experiments to show that flower color influences insect visitation in alpine New Zealand.\nO. caespitosa is one of many alpine species from New Zealand with axillary buds (flower primordia) that form in autumn, but it is also one of a handful of species whos axillary buds are obviously enlarged.\nSeeds of O. caespitosa contain ecdysteroids at 4.5 mg per gram.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nOurisia caespitosa is listed as Not Threatened in the most recent assessment (2017–2018) of the New Zealand Threatened Classification for plants.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Ourisia caespitosa at Wikimedia Commons\nOurisia caespitosa occurrence data from Australasian Virtual Herbarium",

He was a supporter of Maine statehood and served as the state's first Attorney General.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nErastus Foote was born in Waterbury, Connecticut, on September 19, 1777, as the son of Obed and Mary Foote as the fifth of six children. He studied with Samuel Hiockley in Northampton, Massachusetts, and was admitted to the bar in 1800. He opened a law firm in Concord, Massachusetts, but moved to Camden, Maine, when it was still part of Massachusetts, later that year to work as a lawyer. In 1811, he was appointed County Attorney of Lincoln County. He remained in Camden during the War of 1812, and was a given the title of Colonel while serving in the Massachusetts militia.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nIn 1812 he was elected to Massachusetts State Senate as a Jeffersonian Republican.\nIn 1816 he ran for the U.S. House of Representatives for Massachusetts' 16th district, but lost to Federalist Benjamin Orr.\nIn 1819 he was elected to the Massachusetts House.
