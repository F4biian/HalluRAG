        "content": "The Carnot label (French: label Carnot) is an official French label awarded to public research laboratories carrying out scientific research in public–private partnerships. Laboratories that carry the label are also referred to as a Carnot Institute (French: institut Carnot) and form a part of the Carnot network (French: réseau Carnot). Created in 2006, it is awarded by the French Minister of Higher Education and Research, for a renewable five-year period.\nLaboratories holding the Carnot label receive public funding, paid by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche. It is calculated according to the volume and growth, over the duration of the partnership, of research contracts established with companies based on their needs. This funding is in addition to that paid by the companies themselves.\nThe labeling procedure includes a preparatory phase called \"Tremplin Carnot\", designed for laboratories that do not fully meet the required criteria, but receive specific support.\nThe name of the label was chosen in honor of the engineer and physicist Sadi Carnot.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Carnot label was created in 2006, in order to help public-private partnerships for innovation, and supports both SMEs as well as larger corporations.\n\n\n== Organization ==\nThe Carnot network is managed by the Association of Carnot Institutes (AiCarnot), which has a board of directors. Since 2022, Dr. Jean-Denis Muller is the director general.\n\n\n== Laboratories with the Carnot label ==\nAs of March 2024 there are 39 laboratories which have received the Carnot label. A few of them have the term \"Carnot\" in the name but most do not. Some examples of institutes with the Carnot label include:\n\nCarnot Institute ARTS\nInria\nCEA-Leti\nCEA-List\nAP-HP\nCurie Institute\nInstitut du cerveau (ICM), or Paris Brain Institute\nInstitut Carnot Chimie Balard Cirimat\nCALYM\n\n\n== See also ==\nScience and technology in France\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website in English",

        "content": "Mirosław Głos (20 January 1953 – 16 June 2020) was a Polish footballer who played as a midfielder. Głos spent his entire 15-year career playing between MRKS Gdańsk and Lechia Gdańsk.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGłos began his career at MRKS Gdańsk in 1969, the same year as the founding of the MRKS Gdańsk team after a merger between Portowiec Gdańsk and Motława Gdańsk. He spent 4 years with MRKS before joining Lechia Gdańsk, who were playing in the II liga, the second tier of Polish football. However, his first spell with Lechia did not last long, and he was kicked off the team after disciplinary issues during the summer training camp, returning to MRKS.\nAfter a season playing with MRKS, and with Ryszard Kulesza leaving his role as Lechia manager, Głos was given another opportunity with Lechia midway through the following season. He made his Lechia debut in an away match against Warta Poznań, starting the match as Lechia went on to draw 0–0. Głos went on to make 11 league appearances in the second half of the season as he became a starter for the club. Over the following two seasons Głos would go on to make a further 7 league appearances, before moving on in 1977. Over his two and a half year spell with Lechia, he made 19 appearances in all competitions.\nGłos returned to MRKS during the summer of 1977. He spent the next seven seasons with MRKS before retiring. His final appearance before hanging up his boots was to take part in an intra-Lechia friendly, featuring for the Lechia II side. In 2019, Głos played in a friendly celebrating MRKS Gdańsk's 50th birthday. He played for MRKS Gdańsk alongside his son, Dariusz Głos, who also played for Lechia Gdańsk during his career.\nOn 16 June 2020, Głos died aged 67. He was buried in the Nowy Port Cemetery.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "St. Bridget's Church (Finnish: Pyhän Birgitan kirkko, Swedish: Sankta Birgitta kyrka) was a medieval stone church located in the Finnish municipality of Vihti in the Uusimaa region. Built, according to some estimates, between 1500 and 1520, the church now lies in ruins. It served as the main church of the Vihti parish, with Bridget of Sweden as its patron saint.\n\n\n== History and architecture ==\nThe ruins of St. Bridget's Church are located by Lake Hiidenvesi in Vihti. The early 16th-century church was made out of gray stone in a rectangular form with a sacristy attached. The ceiling of St. Bridget's Church had a vault made of wood. Only the sacristy had a stone vaulted ceiling. Both the vaulted ceiling and the inner walls originally featured paintings from 1670. Additionally, a separate bell tower, constructed of timber in 1682, stood on the eastern side of St. Bridget's. It is likely that the stone church was preceded by a wooden church.\nSt. Bridget's Church was constructed on soft, muddy ground, which caused severe problems with its foundation. Large cracks appeared on the walls of the church whenever the ground shifted. In 1656, the entire wall on the western side of St. Bridget's had to be remasoned. The repairs to the cracks and the rebuilding of one wall placed a heavy burden on the parish economy.\nBy 1801, the humidity had caused significant damage to the 16th-century temple, prompting the parish assembly to decide to sell the entire church via auction. Timber and rock from St. Bridget's were utilised as building materials by local farmers, for example, for their new cowsheds. The western wall of the church collapsed during an autumn storm in 1869.\nWhat remains of St. Bridget's Church today is approximately a two-meter-high stone wall, along with a somewhat better-preserved sacristy. Some religious events are held at the church ruin during the summer by the local parish.\nIn 1772, a new church, Vihti Church, was built to replace St. Bridget's.\n\n\n== Images ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

The British ship had been confronting the Swedish frigate repeatedly, after some time the Swedes on Illerim fought back. The battle resulted in British retreat after major damage on their ship. \nThe Swedish frigate named Illerim had before been captured during an ongoing siege after sailing outside of Gibraltar. When the frigate got released in November it was too late for the ship to return home, so it stayed in the Mediterranean over the winter, which also was somewhat good, as Illerim could defend Swedish merchant vessels in the area.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAfter the clash, the Swedish frigate repaired its damage in Málaga. It is also said that the Swedish commander, David Ankarloo, died after injuries.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ellesmere Port Council Offices is a municipal building in Civic Way in Ellesmere Port, a town in Cheshire, in England. The building served as the headquarters of Ellesmere Port and Neston Borough Council but is now disused.\n\n\n== History ==\nFollowing significant population growth, largely associated with the shipping industry, a local board of health was established in the area in 1872. The local board of health was replaced by Wirral Rural District Council in 1894 and by Ellesmere Port and Whitby Urban District Council in 1902. The new council initially established offices at Bank Buildings in Station Street, before opening dedicated offices in 1908. The council then moved to the former home of the Grace family, Whitby Hall, in 1931.After the Second World War, a memorial, in the form of an irregular monolith of stone bearing by a plaque commemorating the lives of veterans involved in the Normandy landings, was unveiled to the west of the council offices at the corner of Stanney Lane and Whitby Road.The area became a municipal borough in 1955 and, in that context, the council found that the Whitby Hall was inadequate and decided to commission a new civic complex. The site they selected was open land on the north side of Stanney Lane. The council offices were the final phase of the development of the new civic complex in the new town centre, following the opening of the Civic Hall in 1955, and a library in 1962.  The new five-storey building was designed under the supervision of the borough engineer and surveyor, Howard Wilson, in the modern style, built in concrete, glass and brick and was completed in 1969. The main frontage was faced with alternating bands of concrete cladding and steel-framed glass and there were brick-clad staircase towers at centre and ends of the structure.The building continued to serve as the local administrative headquarters after the area became part of the new Borough of Ellesmere Port and Neston in 1974. However, council meetings continued to be held at Whitby Hall until the early 1990s, when the council offices were extended. The additions including a new hexagonal shaped structure, containing a purpose-built council chamber, and an underground bunker, intended for use in the event of a nuclear attack. In 2009, the borough became part of Cheshire West and Chester.In 2005, a new civic square was established to the east of the council offices. The centrepiece of the civic square was a new war memorial, in the form of a celtic cross on a cruciform base commemorating the lives of all local service personnel who had died in military conflict, which was unveiled on 11 November 2005.The new council continued to use the building to deliver services until May 2022, when it moved to a new building in the town, The Portal.  Demolition of the building was approved, but was delayed until 2024 due to the need to relocate mobile phone masts from the roof.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Taslim Martin (born 1962) is a British sculptor and designer, creating works that range from public art commissions to domestic-scale items. He has undertaken urban space and park sculpture commissions in the UK and exhibited internationally. He was elected a member of the Royal Society of Sculptors in 2017 and is a Brother of the Art Workers' Guild. Works by Martin are in the permanent collection of the British Museum and of the Horniman Museum. His sister is poet, playwright and activist Ros Martin.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nTaslim Martin was born in 1962 in London, England, to a father originally from Nigeria and a mother from St Lucia. He studied carpentry and joinery at Southend College of Art and Technology, earning a City and Guilds certificate in 1981. He worked as a carpenter for ten years. He went on to attend art schools in Cardiff and then at the Royal College of Art in London (1996–98), awarded the Sir Eduardo Paolozzi Travel Scholarship that enabled him to travel to Nigeria and to undertake research into West African sculpture. After graduating, he spent two years as artist-in-residence at South Hill Park arts centre, Berkshire, which culminated in a solo exhibition in 2000.\nHis work has since been widely shown, both in the United Kingdom and internationally; he has been engaged in gallery exhibitions, public art commissions and teaching, with his output ranging from portrait sculpture to public art and design. He has said: \"From concept to realisation; the designing and making of public art sculptures presents all kinds of interesting challenges, an important part of my job is project management, sourcing materials and services, and presenting to clients, be that a steering group or the local community.\"\nAmong notable exhibitions featuring his work have been Mixed Belongings at the Crafts Council in 2005, Contemporary Primitive at the 198 Gallery in 2007, and Taslim Martin: Disparate Nature in 2010.\nHis sculpture Blue Earth 1807–2007 was installed in the African Worlds Gallery at the Horniman Museum in 2007, in commemoration of the bicentenary of the Slave Trade Act 1807. Among his other public art is Twins, commissioned by Lambeth Council and installed in Brixton in August 2016, as well as a number of sculptures across the UK, including in Bracknell, Tottenham, Birmingham, Cambridge and Milton Keynes.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n1997: Sir Eduardo Paolozzi Travel Scholarship\n1998: Parallel Prize, Parallel Media Group PLC\n2009: The shape of things bursary\n2010: Jerwood Contemporary Makers\n\n\n== Selected exhibitions ==\n1997: Student Showcase, Museum of Mankind, London\n1998: Fish & Chips, British Art and Design Festival, Hamburg\n1998: International Biennial Design Festival, Saint-Etienne\n2000: The Power to Name, South Hill Park Arts Centre, Bracknell, Berkshire (solo show)\n2005: Mixed Belongings, Crafts Council\n2007: Contemporary Primitive, 198 Gallery, London (solo show)\n2008: Mark of Action, the Art House, Lewisham, London\n2009: Made in Africa: portrait of an Ife ruler, The Manchester Museum\n2010: The Global Africa Project, Museum of Art and Design, New York\n2010: The shape of things at Flow, London\n2010: Taslim Martin: Disparate Nature, Touchstones Rochdale (solo show)\n2010: Pan African Craft Exhibition, South Africa\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTaslim Martin website\nTaslim Martin at Art UK.\n\"Taslim Martin - The Shape of Things\" (video), 26 August 2010 .",

His appointment was criticized by some supporters of the club. In 2017, he was appointed manager of Nicaraguan side Juventus FC. He was regarded to have helped the club escape relegation. In 2018, he was appointed manager of Ugandan side Vipers SC. He was also described as \"had no respect for any of his technical staff... often, he would make last gasp changes to the line-up agreed on by the staff... seemed to bench players for no apparent reason\". He was described as \"biggest undoing was the subdued manner in which Vipers got knocked out of the CAF Champions league by Algerian side CS Constantine losing home and away. His sacking may also have been triggered by pressure from the 12th player\". In 2019, he was appointed manager of Rwandan side Rayon Sports FC. He was unbeaten during his first three games in charge of the club.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHe has been married. He has two sons.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Cerro Colorado, popularly known as Minas del Rey Salomón, is a Spanish mining deposit in the province of Huelva, Andalusia, located in the municipalities of Minas de Riotinto and Nerva. Its main mineral reserve is copper with 822,000 proven tonnes, of which 696,500 tonnes are recoverable with the current market and profitability range of the mine. As of 24 June 2021, with 206,297 tonnes already mined, the copper mineral reserve increased to 702,000 proven tonnes. In addition to some 9.4 million ounces of silver.\nThe Cerro Colorado deposit began to be exploited in the late 1960s, after the Riotinto mines had been taken over by Spanish capitalists. It soon became one of the main centres of mining activity in the basin, with the construction of several industrial facilities for the treatment of materials. The extraction work continued until its closure in 2001, due to the low economic profitability of its exploitation. However, since 2015 the deposit has been operational again.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== General description ===\nCerro Colorado is one of the open-pit mines that make up the Minas de Riotinto mining complex, in addition to the Corta Atalaya. It is located within the Iberian Pyrite Belt, in the province of Huelva, about 74 km from Huelva, 65 km from Seville and 500 km from Madrid. Cerro Colorado is one of the largest open pit mines in Europe and has been one of the largest massive sulphide deposits in the world with 500 million tonnes of ore, more than 250 million of which are still unexploited.\n\n\n=== Dimensions and morphology ===\nThe Cerro Colorado deposit currently covers an area of 4.2 km2, has a maximum length of 2020 metres, a width of 850 metres and reaches 230 metres at its deepest point. Cerro Colorado is a complex, irregularly shaped mine, which is divided into three cuts composed of up to four concentrations of massive sulphides: Corta Filón Norte (also known as Cerro Colorado Oeste), Corta Filón Sur, Cerro Salomón and Quebrantahuesos (Corta Cerro Colorado Este). In addition to the latter, to the east are two concentrations called Planes and San Antonio, which Atalaya Mining is studying for exploitation. Another large independent adjacent concentration to the west is Masa San Dionisio, which is the unmined part of Corta Atalaya. In total they host some 71 million sulphides (0.77 million tonnes of copper and 1.18 million tonnes of zinc).\n\n\n=== Resources and reserves ===\nIn 2016, the Cerro Colorado deposit had a total of 258 million tonnes of ore and 1.02 million tonnes of copper.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Original exploitation ===\nThe Spanish Rio Tinto Mining Company took control of the Rio Tinto mining basin in 1954. Within this area there was an unexploited deposit, Cerro Colorado, whose mass consisted of low-grade copper ores and was covered by a gossan overburden. This ferruginous overburden contained significant amounts of gold and silver, while the stockwork mineralisation had a high copper content. In 1966, the Rio Tinto Patiño company was formed to explore and mine Cerro Colorado, with the first work commencing in 1967. From 1968 onwards, a significant part of the basin's mining and mineralogical activities were concentrated at Cerro Colorado, in contrast to the decline of other deposits.\nIn 1978 the management of the mines was taken over by Río Tinto Minera (RTM), a subsidiary of the Explosivos Río Tinto group. Cerro Colorado was, in the early 1980s, one of the main copper mines on the European continent. The mineralurgical process was carried out in an industrial unit that was built in the area to obtain gold and silver through the gossan obtained from Cerro Colorado. Copper and gossan were processed in similar units, albeit separately. The copper concentrate obtained was sent by truck to Huelva. The waste resulting from this operation was condensed in order to recover the water, which in turn was redirected to a nearby dam. Over time, the mineral reserves of the deposit increased with respect to the initial estimates due to the research work carried out in old mines in the area, such as Filón Sur, Quebrantahuesos or Cerro Salomón.\nDuring the 1980s, the mining crisis particularly affected the Riotinto basin, which saw many mines closed. The exception was Cerro Colorado. In 1995 the deposit passed into the hands of the labour corporation Minas de Río Tinto (MRT), which kept it in operation for several years. The cessation of activity was due to the then low price of copper on the international markets, which made its profitability unviable. After several years with losses in the millions of dollars, Cerro Colorado ceased operations in 2001.\n\n\n=== Current stage ===\nThe Cerro Colorado complex was virtually abandoned since 2001, with no maintenance work being carried out, and the deposits were flooded. This situation continued for years. At that time, there were several attempts to restart the exploitation, but none of them were successful.\nIt was not until 2007, due to rising metal prices, that EMED Mining (now known as Atalaya Mining plc) planned to reopen and exploit the site. In 2015, the company was granted a mining permit, and in 2016 it began commercial production and sale of its copper concentrates. The project originally had a 14-year life with reserves of 606,000 tonnes. However, the reserves were subsequently increased to 702,000 tonnes and the project life increased to 16.5 years (13.8 years with the expansion to 15 Mtpa). With the current proven and probable reserves, Cerro Colorado will be 2400 m long, 1250 m wide and have a maximum depth of 335 m when it reaches the end of its life.\n\n\n== Recent production ==\nIn the first phase, throughout 2016, the plant had the capacity to treat between 5 and 7.5 million tonnes of ore per year (37,500 tonnes of concentrate). At the end of that year, phase 2 of maximum production was established, some 45,000 tonnes of concentrate to follow during the first three years of operation (2016–2019). From 2020, production is set at 15 million tonnes of ore and 55,000 tonnes of concentrate.\n\n\n== Mining equipment ==\n\nThe mining stripping equipment consists a fleet composed of:\n\nA total of 53 dump trucks: 4 Komatsu HD605, 10 Komatsu HD465, 40 Komatsu HD785. In addition there is an unspecified number of CAT 777s.\nA total of 15 excavators: 2 Komatsu PC1250, 6 Komatsu PC2000, 1 Hitachi EX1900, 1 Hitachi EX1200, 1 Hitachi ZX890, 3 CAT 6015B and 1 CAT 345b.\nA total of 13 drills: 8 Sandvik Pantera DP1500i, 2 Sandvik Pantera DP1100i, 2 Atlas Copco C50 and Atlas Copco C45.\nOne CAT 993K wheel loader.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRiotinto-Nerva mining basin\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nArenas Posadas, Carlos (2017). \"Riotinto, el declive de un mito minero (1954-2003)\".

        "content": "Enchylium polycarpon, commonly known as the shaly jelly lichen, is a species of foliose lichen in the family Collemataceae. Formerly known as Collema polycarpon, it was renamed in 2013 as part of a taxonomic revision. This lichen has a widespread global distribution, occurring in various regions of North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia.\nE. polycarpon thrives in moderately alkaline or calcareous environments and prefers moderate to high levels of direct sunlight, typically growing on calcareous substrates such as limestone and dolomitic rocks in exposed and periodically wet habitats. Its thallus structure is characterized by an expansive, rosette-like cushion with a deeply lobed morphology, lacking a proper cortex.\nReproductively, E. polycarpon exhibits abundant lecanorine apothecia and immersed pycnidia, indicating both sexual and asexual reproductive strategies. Despite its broad global distribution, the conservation status of this lichen varies significantly across different biogeographic regions, with the species considered rare or threatened in some areas.\nTaxonomically, E. polycarpon was originally described as Collema polycarpon by Georg Franz Hoffmann in 1796, before being transferred to the genus Enchylium in 2013 by Otálora, P.M. Jørg. & Wedin.\nOver time, E. polycarpon has been known by various synonymous names in the scientific literature, such as Collema fasciculare var. polycarpon, Collema melaenum var. polycarpon, Collema multifidum var. polycarpon, Collema plicatum var. polycarpon, and the original Collema polycarpon Hoffm.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nEnchylium polycarpon, commonly referred to as the \"shaly jelly lichen\", derives its name from its taxonomic history and ecological characteristics.\nE. polycarpon was originally described as Collema polycarpon by Georg Franz Hoffmann in 1796 in the publication \"Deutschlands Flora, Zweiter Theil\".\nThe epithet \"polycarpon\" originates from Greek, where \"poly\" means \"many,\" and \"carpon\" refers to \"fruit\" or \"seed,\" alluding to the numerous reproductive structures' characteristic of this species.\n\n\n=== Taxonomic revision ===\nCollema polycarpon was transferred to the genus Enchylium from Collema in 2013 by Otálora, P.M. Jørg. & Wedin, as part of a taxonomic revision published in 2014.\nThe species E. polycarpon (Hoffm.) Otálora, P.M. Jørg. & Wedin belongs to the family Collemataceae.\nE. polycarpon has a subspecies, E. polycarpon subsp. corcyrense (Arnold) Otálora, P.M. Jørg. & Wedin. This subspecies was previously known as Lathagrium orbiculare var. corcyrense Arnold., and has additional synonyms such as Collema polycarpon subsp. corcyrense (Arnold) Pišút and Collema ragusanum Zahlbr.\n\n\n=== Synonymy ===\nEnchylium polycarpon, formerly identified under various synonyms, has undergone taxonomic revisions over time, resulting in a list of historical names used in scientific literature. These synonyms include Collema fasciculare var. polycarpon (Hoffm.) Torss., Collema melaenum var. polycarpon (Hoffm.) Nyl., Collema multifidum var. polycarpon (Hoffm.) Rabenh., Collema plicatum var. polycarpon (Hoffm.) Kremp., and Collema polycarpon Hoffm.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Thallus ===\nEnchylium polycarpon exhibits a distinctive foliose thallus that is gelatinous and thick when hydrated, typically measuring 200–300 μm in depth. This thallus forms expansive rosette-like cushions, ranging from around 3 centimeters up to a maximum of 20 centimetres (7.9 in) in diameter. A key structural feature of the thallus is its deeply lobed morphology, with the lobes radiating outward from the central portion of the cushion.\nThe individual lobes of the corticolous or terricolous thallus themselves are quite elongated, generally 2–4(−6) millimeters in width. Along the margins of these lobes, numerous small, ascending or erect lobules are frequently present, especially towards the interior of the thallus. The lobe tips often exhibit a swollen, plicate (folded) appearance, contributing to a somewhat channeled effect towards the outer extremities of the cushion.\nIn terms of coloration, the upper surface of the thallus can vary from olive-green tones to brownish or even near-black hues. In some specimens, the upper surface may bear granular, isidia-like outgrowths. The lower thallus surface is typically paler than the upper side and is dotted with tufts of white, root-like hapters. Neither an upper nor lower cortex is present on the thallus.\n\n\n=== Apothecia ===\nAscomata in the form of lecanorine apothecia are abundantly produced by Enchylium polycarpon, crowding the central region of the thallus and frequently arising directly from the marginal lobules. These apothecia range from sessile to short-stalked, with a diameter of 1.5–3.5 millimeters. The apothecial disc varies from a reddish-brown to a dark black color, surrounded by a thick, smooth, and persistent thalline margin. Anatomically, the thalline exciple is ecorticate, while the proper exciple is relatively thin and exhibits a euthyplectenchymatous (elongated) to subparaplectenchymatous structure.\n\nThe hymenium is colorless, 65–110 μm in height, and displays a positive iodine reaction (I+ blue). The paraphyses are simple or sparingly branched towards their apices, measuring 2–3 μm in thickness at mid-length and having 4–6.5 μm wide terminal cells. The hypothecium is yellowish to yellowish-brown and also exhibits the iodine-positive blue staining.\nThe asci are 8-spored, cylindrical-clavate in shape, with a strongly thickened apex containing a K/I+ pale blue apical dome and a downwardly projecting K/I+ deep blue tubular structure. The ascospores produced within these asci are (2-)3(−4)-septate, hyaline, and fusiform with acute ends, measuring 15–34 x 6.5–8.5 μm in size.\n\n\n=== Pycnidia ===\nPycnidia are present on the thallus, occurring either on the lamina or along the margins, and are embedded within wart-like structures. These pycnidia are globose in shape and paler in color compared to the surrounding thallus tissue. They give rise to bacilliform (rod-shaped) conidia that are 5–7 x 1-1.5 μm, often with swollen ends.\n\n\n== Chemistry ==\nChemical analysis of the Enchylium polycarpon thallus has shown that it does not contain any lichen substances that can be detected through standard spot tests. All spot tests performed on samples of this lichen have yielded negative results.\nThe fungal component of the E. polycarpon symbiosis does not appear to produce any unique or characteristic secondary metabolites or other products.\nThe absence of specialized lichen substances suggests that E. polycarpon likely relies primarily on the photosynthetic capabilities of its cyanobacterial photobiont, Nostoc, to meet its nutritional and functional needs. Without the production of distinctive metabolites, the lichen may derive its required resources more directly from the photosynthates provided by the Nostoc cyanobacteria.\nE. polycarpon exhibits a preference for substrates with a slightly basic to basic pH, with the species typically occurring on substrata with a pH of 5. This indicates the lichen tolerates and even thrives in environments with somewhat elevated alkalinity, in contrast to many other lichen species that favor more acidic conditions.\nIn terms of solar irradiation, E. polycarpon is adapted to sites with moderate to very high levels of direct sunlight, occupying sun-exposed areas with solar irradiation values ranging from 4 to 5 on the 5-point scale. The lichen is able to avoid the stresses of extreme solar exposure, but nevertheless prefers habitats that receive ample direct sunlight over more shaded environments.\nWith regards to moisture availability, E. polycarpon exhibits a xerophytic to rather xerophytic ecological profile, with an aridity value of 4 on the 5-point scale. This allows the lichen to tolerate and even thrive in moderately dry conditions, in contrast to more hygrophilic species.\nAnalysis of the lichen's response to eutrophication, or elevated nutrient and dust deposition, shows E. polycarpon can occupy sites ranging from those with very low levels of eutrophication (value 1) to those with moderate eutrophication (value 3) on the 5-point scale. However, the lichen does not appear to tolerate environments with high or very high levels of eutrophication, suggesting a sensitivity to excessive anthropogenic enrichment of its substrate.\nIn terms of its response to human disturbance, E. polycarpon is classified as a species that occurs predominantly in natural or semi-natural habitats, with a poleotolerance value of 1 to 2 on the 4-class scale. This indicates the lichen prefers relatively undisturbed environmental conditions and may serve as an indicator of habitat quality and ecological continuity.\nRegarding altitudinal distribution, chemical and distribution analysis exhibits that E. polycarpon is found primarily in the eu-Mediterranean, submediterranean, and montane vegetation belts, with an altitudinal range of 1 to 3 on the 6-point scale. The lichen does not appear to extend its range into the higher-elevation oroboreal, alpine, or nival zones of mountainous regions.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n\n\n=== Collema polycarpon ===\nCollema polycarpon has been documented in localities across Europe, North America, and western Asia over past centuries.\nThe 1800–1899 period saw observations reported from additional Scandinavian regions, with collections made in Öland and Härjedalen provinces of Sweden as well as in Norway. Into the 1900s, documentation expanded across parts of Northern and Central Europe. Repeat localities in Sweden included Gotland, Öland, and Östergötland provinces. The Abisko area of northern Sweden and Raudekfjället in neighboring Norway also hosted C. polycarpon observations.\nRecords since 2000 document observations from the provinces of Ontario and Manitoba in Canada, as well as from sites in central Texas, United States. C. polycarpon continues to be reported from its stronghold areas in Scandinavia as well, with continued observations from sites on Gotland and the Manitoulin and Kawartha Lakes districts of Ontario, Canada.\nFrequent habitats of C. polycarpon included dolomitic and limestone rocks, as well as leaf humus in mixed forests.\n\n\n=== Enchylium polycarpon ===\n\nEnchylium polycarpon has a widespread global distribution, with records spanning across multiple continents. The species is known to occur in various regions of North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia.\nIn North America, E. polycarpon has been documented in several states within the western United States, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The species has also been reported from the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Labrador, Northwest Territories, Ontario, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. Further south, it has been recorded in the Mexican state of Chihuahua.\nAcross the Atlantic, E. polycarpon has a widespread distribution throughout Europe. Within the continent, the species has been reported from numerous countries, including Italy, France, Ireland, and the Czech Republic. In Italy, it has been observed in various regions such as Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Sardinia, Campania, Puglia, Calabria, and Sicily. France and Ireland also host populations of this lichen species. According to the Atlas of Czech Lichens, in the Czech Republic, E. polycarpon is \"linked to karst areas and occurs only locally.\"\nBeyond Europe, Enchylium polycarpon has been documented in parts of northern Africa. The species has also been recorded in eastern and southern Africa, including South Africa. In Asia, the lichen has been found in India.\nRegarding the habitat preferences of E. polycarpon, the species typically grows on hard, usually calcareous rock substrates in exposed and periodically wet microhabitats. While the lichen has been observed on both acidic and basic rock types, it appears to have a preference for calcareous substrates. On rare observations, E. polycarpon has been found on siliceous (sandstone) rocks in Italy, and in volcanic rock at Lake Clark National Park and Preserve in Alaska.\nE. polycarpon is often found in association with other members of the Collemataceae family, such as Enchylium multipartitum.\n\n\n=== Commoness-rarity ===\nEnchylium polycarpon exhibits a varied distribution and commonness across different biogeographic belts and regions in Europe.\nIn the higher elevational zones, the species is reported to be absent from the Alpine and Subalpine belts. Similarly, it is absent from the Oromediterranean belt, which covers the higher mountain areas of the Mediterranean region.\nDescending to the Montane belt, E. polycarpon becomes extremely rare in its occurrence. However, as the elevations decrease further, the species becomes more prevalent, though still considered rare, in the Submediterranean belt.\nWithin the Padanian area, which encompasses the southern side of the Alps and the Po River Valley in northern Italy, the lichen is documented to be very rare.\nIn the Humid Submediterranean and Humid Mediterranean belts, E. polycarpon is reported to be rather rare in its distribution.\nFinally, in the Dry Mediterranean belt, which includes the southern parts of the Mediterranean region, the species is considered rare.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nThe conservation status of Enchylium polycarpon varies significantly across its global and regional distributions. At the global level, the species is listed as GNR, meaning its overall conservation status is unranked by NatureServe.\n\n\n=== North America ===\nIn Canada, E. polycarpon has a national status of N4N5, indicating the species is generally common to very common nationwide. However, the provincial and territorial-level assessments show a more complex picture. In the Northwest Territories and Ontario, the species is considered imperiled to vulnerable, with an S2S3 ranking. The status is slightly better in Alberta, where it is ranked as S3S4, making it vulnerable to apparently secure. Populations in British Columbia are apparently secure (S4), while the Yukon Territory hosts even more secure populations, with an S4S5 status. The status remains unranked (SNR) in Quebec and Saskatchewan, and unresolved (SU) in Labrador.\nAcross the border in the United States, the national status for E. polycarpon is listed as unranked (NNR). At the state level, the species is considered imperiled (S2) in Montana, possibly extirpated (SH) in Iowa and Wisconsin, and unranked (SNR) in Colorado, Georgia, Minnesota, and Wyoming.\nAccording to the Government of Northwest Territories, E. polycarpon is considered a 'Sensitive' species in the territory, meaning inventory is needed to determine its precise status. The species is ranked as S2S3, or potentially imperiled to vulnerable within the territory.\n\n\n=== Europe ===\nMoving to Europe, the conservation assessments are more concerning. In the Czech Republic, E. polycarpon has been evaluated as Vulnerable (VU) on the 2010 Red List and Endangered (C3) on the 2023 Red List. The situation is similar in Finland, where the species is listed as Near Threatened (NT) on the 2019 and 2010 regional Red Lists, having previously been assessed as Least Concern (LC) in 2000. It is also considered a regionally threatened species in several biogeographic regions of Finland.\nIn Great Britain and Ireland, E. polycarpon has been assessed as of Least Concern by Woods & Coppins (2012) but is listed as Nationally Scarce due to the paucity of records, suggesting it may be under-reported in this region.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nNorth American Lichen Checklist, Version (#20) 19 April 2015.\nEnchylium polycarpon in Index Fungorum.\nEnchylium polycarpon in MycoBank.",

        "content": "The Saint Petersburg International Commercial Bank (Russian: Санкт-Петербургский международный коммерческий банк) was a major bank in the Russian Empire, founded in 1869 in Saint Petersburg. By the start of the 20th century it was Russia's second private-sector bank by assets, behind the Volga-Kama Commercial Bank,: 43  and by 1914 it still held that rank behind the Russo-Asiatic Bank.: 722  In late 1917 following the Russian Revolution, like all other commercial banks in Russia, it was absorbed into the State Bank with no compensation to its shareholders.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe bank's charter was approved by Alexander II on 9 June 1869. The bank's fixed capital was initially determined at 5 million rubles and was distributed into 20 thousand shares of 250 rubles each. It was initially backed by German investors, especially the Berlin-based Disconto-Gesellschaft. \nIn 1896, the International Commercial Bank became the largest shareholder of the newly established Russo-Chinese Bank, with 15.3 percent of the initial capital. It had close links with Russia's military-industrial complex and controlled over 50 companies in 1914, including rail carriers, industrial enterprises, and insurance companies.\nThe bank was initially located at 6, Angliyskaya Embankment. In 1898, the bank moved to a new purpose-built head office at 58 Nevsky Prospekt on a design by architect Stanislas A. Brzhozovsky. The latter property was expanded in 1912 with an additional building facing Ekaterininskaya Street.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nVolga-Kama Commercial Bank\nAzov-Don Commercial Bank\nRusso-Asiatic Bank\nRussian Bank for Foreign Trade\nMoscow Merchant Bank\n\n\n== Notes ==",

        "content": "Peter Ogden (died 1852) was the founder of the Grand United Order of Odd Fellows in America. This fraternal order was a Benefit society open to African American men and was heavily involved with the early civil rights movement. Ogden was born in the West Indies and served on the S.S. Patrick Henry as a ship steward.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nNot much is known about Peter Ogden's early life. The official history of the Grand United Order of Odd Fellows in America claims he was born in the West Indies. Other sources specify Jamaica or New York. Ogden was a sailor and then steward on the S.S. Patrick Henry that sailed between Liverpool and New York City. While in Liverpool, Ogden was initiated in Odd Fellowship in Victoria Lodge, No. 448.\n\n\n== The Grand United Order of Odd Fellows in America ==\nThe Philomathean Institute was formed in New York City in 1842 by educated Black men of that city including Patrick H. Reason and James Fields. The Institute petitioned the Independent Order of Odd Fellows for a charter, but they were denied because of their race. Ogden, informed about the rejection, urged the men to instead seek recognition from the Grand United Order of Oddfellows in England in what he thought was a purer form of Odd Fellowship without American racism. Ogden returned to England and petitioned the Victoria Lodge to grant a charter to the institute. In 1843, the Philomathean Lodge, No. 646, was established in New York City with Peter Ogden as the first Grand Master.\nOgden initiated the other men into Odd Fellowship bringing over the ritual and symbolism from England and oversaw the creation of a second lodge in New York, the Hamilton Lodge, No. 710. Unity Lodge, No. 711, was soon established in Philadelphia. Rising Star, No. 713, established in Hartford, Connecticut was the first lodge in Connecticut. Ogden continued to sail in-between New York and England and often carried correspondence, questions, and reports between the leadership in New York and the leadership in England. By Ogden's death in 1852, there were twenty-five lodges in America with over 1500 members.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nPeter Ogden was married though his wife's name is unknown. He died on November 29, 1852, in New York.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Temptation\" is a song by American rapper Joey Badass, sent to urban contemporary radio on June 13, 2017, as the third single from his second studio album All-Amerikkkan Badass (2017). It was produced by 1-900 and Kirk Knight.\n\n\n== Background and composition ==\nIn an interview with GQ, Joey Badass chose \"Temptation\" as a track from All-Amerikkkan Badass that he was particularly proud of, saying \"When I made that song, instantly it was my favorite song ever. Not just out of songs that I have made, literally my favorite song ever.\"\nThe song features excerpts of nine-year-old girl Zianna Oliphant's tearful speech on police brutality to the Charlotte City Council following the killing of Keith Lamont Scott and subsequent protests. Joey stated he saw a video of the speech on Instagram and it \"just really struck a chord in my heart.\" He added, \"When I first saw it I didn't even think I was going to use it in a song, but then when 'TEMPTATION' got near the final stages I just had an idea that the video would go perfectly. I literally put it in GarageBand and mashed it up myself, and it turned out perfect.\"\nJoey Badass includes sung vocals in the song. Lyrically, he describes feeling helpless and being tempted to engage in bad behavior due to the injustices on Black people, also begging \"Tell me Lord can you help me / I said Lord can you help me?\" He addresses his own experiences of being racially discriminated against, advocates for his people to improve themselves through taking action, and chides people who are \"complaining all day but in the same condition\" and mentally \"enslaved by their religion.\"\n\n\n== Music video ==\nAn official music video was released on August 14, 2017. Directed by Joey Badass himself and Nathan Smith, it sees Joey visiting his hometown of Brooklyn, opening with a grainy clip of the city from the Brooklyn Bridge. It then shows the rapper walking through a church and a group of children running home and playing with each other while the police conduct a stop-and-frisk search outside of their brownstone apartment and harass Black men on sidewalks. Badass begins rapping on the stairs of the home as his lyrics depict the lives of people in the household; he watches a mother laying down and a man in another room packing his gun with him before heading to work. Badass accompanies a little girl, taking a stroll through the neighborhood with her as they meet a group of men on the sidewalk who start dancing to the song. After dropping off the girl with her mother, Badass gives an outdoor performance with a band that is shut down by police, and joins others inside a church.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Elizabeth Augusta Russell (née, Sawtell; known in the press as Mrs. E. A. Russell; 1832–1911) was an American philanthropist, reformer, and restaurateur. She served as National Superintendent of coffee house work for the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) and was the founder of the Russell Coffee House in Minneapolis, Minnesota, which, in its day, was the largest coffeehouse in the city.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nElizabeth Augusta Sawtell was born in Mason, New Hampshire, on October 3, 1832. Her father and mother were Yankees, the father from Rindge, New Hampshire, and the mother from Ashburnham, Massachusetts. Her father was a farmer and she was one of a family of ten.\nShe was educated in the common schools of her town and later, paid her own way through school at the New Ipswich Academy in New Ipswich, New Hampshire. She was trained in habits of industry, morals and the severe theologies of the day, after the belief of the Congregationalists.\n\n\n== Career ==\nShe taught in New Hampshire schools for four or five years and in the fall of 1860, went to Florence, Alabama to teach in the Florence Synodical Female College, a large Presbyterian school with a boarding house annex for the resident pupils.\n\n\n=== American Civil War ===\nDuring the Battle of Big Bethel, she returned to her home in the North. After a short stay at home, she went to New York City with the intention of fitting herself by further study for a higher position as a teacher. This did not occur as soldiers wounded in the First Battle of Bull Run were being brought in and needed care. At first, her family took in two soldiers in its home. Then Russell, her mother and her sister began providing care ti the sick and wounded at 194 Broadway, known as the New England Soldiers' Relief Association. On retirement of the matron, sent by Governor Andrews from Massachusetts, Russell was appointed to succeed her. She was 26 years old at the time and remained as matron of the Association until the close of the war. the matron's salary was small and Russell was often at a loss for means to relieve the many cases which appealed to her and for which the government at that time had made no provision. The Association was the first provision made for the wounded soldiers, David's Island and Bedloe's Island being opened later. the wounded came by rail and by boat, from a dozen to 200 or more at a time. Russell wsa resident matron of this place for nearly five years. She was not mustered out until the close of the war, During those years in the hospital, she did not content herself with a superficial knowledge. She visited Washington, D.C. to study hospital methods. After the close of the war, her services were recognized by a pension grant.\n\n\n=== Post-war ===\nAt the close of the war, she was employed as a teacher in New Orleans by the Freedmen's Bureau. She had entire charge of the Colored Orphan Asylum in New Orleans.\nHer next position was that of matron of a soldiers' home at Togus Springs, near Augusta, Maine. Here she remained four years. The building burned during her term of service but there was no loss of life. Russell accompanied 30 of the more helpless of the inmates to Augusta where they found shelter in the town hall until another building could be obtained.\nAfter a brief service in the post office in Boston, she became matron of the Continental Hotel in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, a position she held eight years, including the year of the nation's centennial anniversary. Here she had her first experience in managing a large force of domestic help, making a success of it from the first.\nIn 1879, she left Philadelphia for a year of recreation in Europe. In company with a woman who was an old friend, she visited Naples, Florence, Rome, and London, but before the year was up, she was summoned to take charge of the Grand Union Hotel at Saratoga Springs, New York, and later, had a similar position in A. T. Stewart's Hotel in Park Avenue, New York. She remained here two years, and spent the two following summers as matron of the Oriental Hotel in Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, New York. She next went to the Neil House in Columbus, Ohio, which later she left for the West Hotel in Minneapolis, Minnesota, remaining at the West four years.\nIt was about the year 1888 when, being called to open and manage a coffee house in Minneapolis in the interest of the WCTU, she felt that the opportunity of her life to do good had come. The enterprise was in many ways a success. The place was attractive, the table appointments were dainty, the food was the best obtianable. The attendants were young people, students at high school or college; these, in return for their hours of service, learned the civilities of life and received substantial help in paying their school expenses. On Sundays, the place was closed to the public. Russell made restaurant living not only respectable but popular. Her place had a national reputation. There was nothing really like it in the U.S. Minneapolis was at that time a city of only about 15,000, and the coffee house guests averaged 2,500 a day. For five years, she conducted this establishment, when she reluctantly left it.  \nAt the National WCTU's convention in 1891, she was made National Superintendent of coffeehouse work. In this role, she collected statistics for her report on the coffee houses of the U.S. During the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893, she was in charge of the management of the World's Fair Temperance Hotel, located in Harvey, Illinois. \nOn March 7, 1894, in Minneapolis, at 23 Fourth Street South, she opened the Russell Coffee House, which was conducted along the same lines as the WCTU's Central Coffee House.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nIn Worcester, Massachusetts, on November 24, 1854, she married Dexter Russell (1826–1861). All her married life was spent in Ashburnham, Massachusetts. Her husband and many of her family are buried there.\nIn 1902, Russell was noted to be a proponent of absolute fasting, doing so for three weeks and three days at a time. She fasted for the sole purpose of reducing weight, noting that she found fasting very beneficial in numerous ways.\nFrom 1905, she made her winter residence in Miami, Florida where she sustained a severe fall in the spring of 1910 from which she never recovered. Elizabeth Augusta Russell died January 7, 1911 in Minneapolis.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Works related to Woman of the Century/Elizabeth Augusta S. Russell at Wikisource",

She eventually returned to music, joining The Dapper Dandies and formed the jazz band Tiffany Pollack and Co.  Pollack had been adopted at birth, and at age twenty-five was reunited with her biological family, where she discovered she was first cousins with blues-rock guitarist Eric Johanson who was lead guitarist for Cyril Neville and Terrance Simien, and had released his debut solo album Burn It Down in 2017. The cousins' mothers encouraged the two to work together. The two performed together at various locations, their first public performance was at the Arts Council of Central Louisiana's A-Town Jazz Series. From the recordings of that performance, Nola Blues Records offered them a deal to make an album together.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n== References ==",

In late 1917 following the Russian Revolution, like all other commercial banks in Russia, it was absorbed into the State Bank with no compensation to its shareholders.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe bank was founded in 1866 in Moscow in the form of a stock partnership by 77 local entrepreneurs led by Ivan A. Lyamin, who became its chairman. The bank's charter was approved by Alexander II on 1 June 1866. The initial share capital was 1.26 million rubles. \nThe bank financed mainly textile enterprises in the Central Industrial Region and, in the late 19th century, was for some time the second largest in assets among private-sector banks in Russia. At the start of the 20th century it was still third-largest, and the largest one not headquartered in Saint Petersburg.: 43  \n\n\n== See also ==\nPavel Tretyakov\nSaint Petersburg International Commercial Bank\nAzov-Don Commercial Bank\nRusso-Asiatic Bank\nRussian Bank for Foreign Trade\nVolga-Kama Commercial Bank\n\n\n== Notes ==",

        "content": "The Algiers-Cape Town Rally (or Mediterranean Rally) was an automobile rally competition organised by Les Amis du Sahara et de l'Eurafrique with the assistance of various African Automobile Clubs including the Association sportif de l'automobile club d Algiers, under the post-war control of the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, for cars and trucks.\n\n\n== Prelude (1924) ==\nFrom 1924 Captain Delingette and his wife accompanied by the mechanic Bonnaure (initially driver of the Gradis trans-Saharan raid) crossed the African continent from north to south (Oran - Cape Town, via Nairobi, Elisabethville and Johannesburg), for a \"Trip of study and propaganda, alone and without organisation\" over 23 000 km with a 6-wheel 10HP Renault vehicle.\n\n\n== Gestation (1930) ==\nBrigadier General Octave Meynier designed and organized the first edition of the event, just like twenty years before that of the Mediterranean - Niger Rally (or Trans-Saharan Rally, or Algiers - Gao Rally, known as \"tourist\") between February and March 1930 on more than 6 000 km on the occasion of the centenary of French Algeria, 11 teams each of 4 cars taking the start. The four Cottin & Desgouttes “Sans Secousses” type TA vehicles from 1929 were declared winners.\n\n\n== 1st edition (1951) ==\nThe race took place over 15 000 km in 11 stages from 30 December 1950 to 23 January 1951, including just 700 on asphalt roads, with 32 starting vehicles (75 teammates and 7 nations) for 31 finishers. A French military team on a Delahaye pick-up, belonging to the First Category, that of all-terrain vehicles, won the event on one of the six vehicles of this type entered by the brand, divided into two groups. Captain Monnier and Colonel Henri Debrus were part of the victorious crew. For cars, in class >2L. Veglia won over Willys- Jeep, in class 1.1 to 2L. Lapalu on Land Rover was the winner, and in less than 1.1L. Ms. D'Ieteren became the winner, on Volkswagen. During the same period, André Mercier and Charles de Cortanze (class winner at Liège-Rome-Liège in 1950 on 203) covered -independently- a route opposite to that of the event in less than 17 days only, on a Peugeot 203 between 26 December 1950 and 11 January 1951 (15 020 km). This record was beaten again by the Belgian Henri Loos and the Swiss Henri Maurice Berney, who rode from Cape Town through Algiers to Paris between 16 March and 29 March 1951 on a Ford V8 (15,237 km), in 13 days, 13 hours and 19 minutes.\n\n\n== 2nd edition (1953) ==\nGiven the rally's immediate success, the same route was then taken by the competitors for nearly 16 000 km in February, over 25 days. A specially prepared Fiat 1900 Kontiki type was declared the winner, led by the Turin factory crew Bruno Martignoni, Gilo Rabezzana and Franco Mazzuccheli. It was triumphantly displayed on the Fiat stand at the 1953 Turin Motor Show.\nOn 12 March 1953, Captain Jean Heurtaux and Colonel Marceau Crespin were mandated by the French army to bring back a Delahaye type 235 Coach 6 cylinder 3.6L. of 152CV, using the Hoggar route. This car had just finished tenth of the rally with Commander Pottier, Captain de Courcel and Chief Sergeant Houard. This was done in 10 days, 5 hours and 15 minutes, which constituted at the time a new record for the South-North African distance established between Cape Town and Algiers, established over 14 300 km. Still independently of the event, from 19 December 1953 to 25 January 1954, Michel Bernier and Jacques Duvey made the journey from Cape Town to Algiers over 17 500 km alone aboard a 'a 2CV, before going to classify their vehicle in the Monte-Carlo Rally after a detour through Oslo.\n\n\n== 3rd edition (1956) ==\nIt took place from 11 January to 25 February, on the reverse route from Cape Town to Algiers, in 44 days with six cars over a distance of 13 500 km. Finished tied 1st for the Italian-Swiss crews, Bruno Martignoni -Schwartz on Fiat 1100 TV and Doctor Haldeman (maternal grandfather of Elon Musk) on Ford \"Ranch Wagon \" 5.4L (on the second Stanleyville-Algiers section of 6 812 km Marinai and Martine won over Peugeot 203 (first Martignoni-Schwartz section from Cape Town to Stanleyville, over 6 730 km)).\n\n\n== 4th edition (1959) ==\nAfter 44 days of racing from 7 January to 20 February, the German Karl Kling associated with co-driver Rainer Günzler won the event in an official Mercedes 190D, the Belgian Olivier Gendebien finishing second with his wife on an ID 19. Peugeot won the Marques' Cup thanks to its 203 (with Henriot and the crews Cochard / Laverny, Paysant / Largo and Gain / Gain), as well as the Ladies' Cup with Henriot, Paysant and Largo, all three wives of members of the male crews aforementioned. The trucks category was won by the crew Bachir Rouighi (owner of a trans-Saharan transport company) / Pellerin on UNIC Verdon 6 cylinders of 130HP and 12 tonnes.\n\n\n== 5th edition (1961) ==\nThe road to the new Zairian state being now closed, the event was shortened and then became the Algiers-Bangui-Algiers International Rally, or Algiers-Central Africa Rally and return, over 11 500 km covered in 18 days in January by 15 cars. The race became essentially \"performance\", although The African Route (a \"tourist\" event) was jointly organised over 34 days. Kling and Günzler again became the winners, now on a 220SE model from the Stuttgart firm. Olivier Gendebien this time finished 4th with his compatriot Lucien Bianchi, still on an ID19, while Paul Frère and Jean Vinatier were 3rd. The Ladies' Cup went to Annie Soisbault and her co-pilot Michèle Cancre, on the same model.\n\n\n== Anecdotes ==\nSome fights occurred between competitors in 1951, with one man even being abandoned in the desert by his own teammate because he was considered undesirable.\nIn 1971, automobile designer and record holder Richard Noble completed a raid from London to Cape Town, and back via India.\nIn 1972, the brothers Claude and Bernard Marreau as well as Yvon Garin won a new Trans-African Raid from Cap to Algiers of 15 432 km on a Renault 12 Gordini. Their time achieved for the south–north transcontinental crossing is still not equaled to this day.\nIn 1992, Gilbert Sabine organized the Paris-Sirte-Cape Town rally raid over 11 000 km for the XIV edition of the Dakar Rally. It was won by Hubert Auriol and Philippe Monnet on Mitsubishi Pajero in the car category, by Stéphane Peterhansel in the motorcycle category on Yamaha YZE750T and by Francesco Perlini, Giorgio Albiero and Claudio Vinante in the truck category on Perlini .\n\n\n== Video library ==\nSaharan Algeria Niger Rally 1930 - Cottin Desgouttes (Berliet Foundation) ;\nRenault Le Cap, director Serge de Poligny January 1, 1951 ( INA, 45 min 44 s). Serge de Poligny also directed, in 1951, the documentary Algiers - Le Cap .\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nFrom Oran to Cape Town on six wheels by Commander and Madame Delingette, 1927, draeger in-8 square paperback printed in 100 copies based on 11 original woodcuts executed by Jacques Boullaire in 1925 ASIN: B00185DET0;\nCan 5, in a rally across the Sahara, Marthe Oulié, ed.

        "content": "Resko Przymorskie (German: Kamper See) is a coastal lake of the Baltic Sea on the Trzebiatów Coast, located in the West Pomeranian Voivodeship, within the gminas of Trzebiatów and Kołobrzeg. The surface area of the water body varies, according to various sources, from 55.39 square kilometers to even 66.86 square kilometers.\nAs a coastal lake, the water body serves as a protected natural habitat within the Natura 2000 network (Special Area of Conservation) known as the Trzebiatów-Kołobrzeg Coastal Belt. The lake's waters have been assessed as non-pristine, and the lake itself as vulnerable to environmental degradation.\nThe area of Resko Przymorskie is a breeding ground for waterfowl and a refugium for anseriformes. Thirteen breeding species have been observed around the lake, including four endangered species.\nIn terms of fishery typology, it is a pike-perch lake.\nResko Przymorskie is a shallow, polymictic lake with its bottom located in a cryptodepression.\n\n\n== Location ==\n\nThe lake is located in the eastern part of the Trzebiatów Coast, in the northern part of the West Pomeranian Voivodeship, within the counties of Kołobrzeg and Gryfice. The western part of the lake belongs to the gmina of Trzebiatów, while the eastern part belongs to the gmina of Kołobrzeg.\nThe lake is separated from the Baltic Sea by a narrow strip of spit formed by a coastal dune ridge. The width of the spit varies from 0.3 to 1 km. The dunes on the lake's spit reach heights of up to 16 meters above sea level. Dźwirzyno lies along the northeastern shore of the lake, with a water station and a landing. Rogowo, with two holiday resorts, is situated along the northwestern shore of the lake.\nThe entire area of Resko Przymorskie, along with its surroundings, is located within the Trzebiatów-Kołobrzeg Coastal Belt, designated as a Special Area of Conservation under the Natura 2000 program. The lake is also situated within the Special Protection Area known as the \"Trzebiatów Coast\".\n\n\n== Hydrological information ==\nResko Przymorskie is a natural water reservoir formed as a result of the separation of the bay by a spit from the sea. The surface area of the water mirror varies according to different sources, ranging from 55.39 km2 through 55.9 km2, 57.71 km2, 6.2 km2 up to 66.86 km2. The differences in the reported sizes are significant and result from the variability of the lake's water level, which depends on weather conditions. Due to its free connection to the sea, the water resources in the lake and its surface area depend on the direction and strength of the winds, especially during storm surges. Within a day, the lake's water levels can rise by 0.5 meters, and during prolonged storms, the water level can be higher by up to 1.5 meters above normal, reaching over the embankments surrounding the lake. In 1949, the influx of seawater was so significant that it caused a flood. The water mirror is located at a height of 0.1 m above sea level or 0.3 m above sea level. The average depth of the lake is 1.3 m, while the maximum depth is 2.5 m. In the central-western part of the lake, there is a sandbank with a depth of 1 m.\nThe volume of water in the reservoir is 7703.4 thousand m³. The length of the shoreline at the average water level is estimated at 11.7 km, and this line stands out in comparison to other Polish coastal lakes. The lake bed is mostly sandy and was described as poorly silted in the early 1980s (at that time, the water transparency reached up to 1.5 m).\n\n\n== Drainage basin ==\n\nThe lake's drainage basin consists of the drainage basins of watercourses flowing into it. The Resko Przymorskie drainage basin belongs to the catchment area of the coastal rivers of the Baltic Sea.\nOne of the western bays of the lake is fed by the Old Rega, which is the old bed of the Rega river, flowing into the Baltic Sea west of Resko Przymorskie. Besides the Old Rega, various-sized ditches connect to the lake from the western and southern sides.\nOn the eastern shore, the Łużanka river, which is the lower course of the Dębosznica river, flows into the lake. Further north, waters from the so-called Nowa Błotnica (also Bagienny Rów), a canal (new channel) of the Błotnica river, flow into Resko Przymorskie. The former course of the river, in turn, flows into the lake further north on the eastern shore near Dźwirzyno.\n\nResko Przymorskie is connected to the sea in the northeastern part through a wide channel called Regoujście. The flow of water through the channel is unrestricted. The water level in the lake is variable, depending on the often prevailing sea winds causing surges when seawater enters the lake – hence the fluctuating data on the lake's surface area.\nA small watercourse also flows into the lake from the southern shore, known as the inflow from Gosław.\n\n\n== Nature ==\n\nOn the eastern, southern, and western sides, extensive reed beds intersected by a network of ditches adjoin the lake. More stable ground covered with forest is located on the northern shore.\nThe coastal location of the lake and the free exchange of water between it and the sea are the reasons for the typical occurrence of species of animals that are typically freshwater and marine. Affinity with the Baltic fauna is especially evident near the watercourse connecting the lake to the sea.\nAccording to data from the regional water management authority, the dominant fish species in the waters of Resko Przymorskie are: common bream, white bream, common roach, and northern pike. Other fish species found in the lake include: European eel, European perch, zander, tench, common rudd, ruffe, and common bleak.\nThe lake has inaccessible, heavily reed-covered shores, making it a refuge for many species of waterfowl. On the shores in the northern part of the lake near the outflow of the Regoujście, one of the three sites in Poland of the critically endangered plant species, the dwarf spikerush, was located.\nOver Resko Przymorskie, 13 breeding bird species have been observed, including 4 classified as endangered in at least one scale (international, national, or regional) – the greylag goose, common goldeneye, bearded reedling, and red-backed shrike. Other bird species appear periodically during migrations or sometimes in winter, or they utilize the lake waters throughout the year as foraging grounds, for example, the white-tailed eagle. During migration seasons, they stop quite abundantly, in flocks ranging from tens to hundreds of individuals: grebes, Eurasian coots, common cranes, gulls, geese, and ducks. Among migrating birds, species listed in IUCN Red List, such as the northern pintail and osprey, have also been observed. Rare species in Poland such as common cranes, little gulls, and lesser black-backed gull are also encountered. The lake as a bird paradise was already described by the German ornithologist Artur B.G. Butz in 1933.\nIn 2007, the gmina of Kołobrzeg planned an ecological area in the eastern part of Resko Przymorskie (the western part belongs to the gmina of Trzebiatów). This area is a breeding ground for waterfowl and a refugium for migratory waterfowl, as well as a breeding ground for amphibians, reptiles, and mammals.\n\n\n== Sanitary condition ==\nAs a result of research conducted in 1996 and 2003, the waters of Resko Przymorskie were classified as outside the classification system, and the lake itself was deemed not resistant to external influences. In terms of phosphates and mineral nitrogen content, the water met the requirements of Class I for sanitary condition. The studies showed the lake's richness in organic and mineral substances. The waters exhibited very high concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, chlorophyll, and seston dry mass. Water transparency was described as very low. The main inflow to the lake is the Błotnica River, whose waters are classified as Class III quality. Downstream from the water quality measurement point, Błotnica also receives water from the Dębosznica river, which has Class IV water quality.\nThe lake is heavily eutrophicated, and its water quality does not meet the standards of Class III purity for lake waters. It is a shallow body of water with limited water exchange. Water outflow occurs directly into the sea and is possible when the Baltic Sea level is low in the coastal area. Water quality is determined by strong phytoplankton blooms, as well as high concentrations of biogenic elements and excessive amounts of organic compounds.\nIn Rogowo, sewage was discharged into a military sewage treatment plant, which was technically malfunctioning. Currently, sewage is directed to a sewage treatment plant near Trzebiatów. In 1993, Dźwirzyno was connected to the sewage system, and sewage from the town is directed to a sewage treatment plant in Grzybowo. Previously, one holiday resort had a \"Bioblok\" sewage treatment plant. Sewage from the remaining facilities was removed.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nThe Regional Water Management Board in Szczecin is the administrator of the waters of Resko Przymorskie. It has established a fishing area that includes the waters of Resko Przymorskie along with the waters of watercourses flowing into the lake that do not constitute separate districts, i.e., without the Błotnica and Łużanka rivers. The water body is managed by the \"Mielno\" Fisheries Company, which conducts fisheries management in the lake and charges fees for fishing. Net fishing is hindered by wrecks lying on the lake bottom, remnants from the war.\nNear the mouth of the Old Rega into the lake, there is a private special fishing ground on ponds covering an area of approximately 2.5 hectares, where local tourists engage in fishing.\nAccording to data from the Provincial Inspectorate of Environmental Protection in Szczecin from 2004, common reed is harvested in many places around the lake.\n\n\n=== Tourism resources ===\nResko Przymorskie is a tourist destination during the summer season.\n\nIn Dźwirzyno, at the mouth of the Błotnica river into the lake, a wooden marina with a landing has been built, where pedal boats and yachts are available. This area is used as a base for windsurfing and kiteboarding enthusiasts. The vicinity of the marina is a popular walking spot for holidaymakers.\nAcross the spit of Resko Przymorskie, an international cycling route, the Baltic Sea Cycle Route (R-10), runs along a county road, which is part of the EuroVelo network (EV10). South of the lake, the Coastal Hiking Trail (red, Świnoujście–Żarnowiec) runs through Mrzeżyno, Roby, Karcino, and Dźwirzyno.\nThe Cycling Tourism Association from Kołobrzeg has designated the \"Cycling Trail around Lake Resko Przymorskie\", which is 52 km long. Additionally, a natural and historical cycling route called \"Towards the Sun\" has been established in the eastern part of the lake.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest written records regarding the lake pertain to natural contributions in the form of fish that the inhabitants of the fishing village, established in 1180 by the Premonstratensians and situated by Lake Resko Przymorskie, were supposed to deliver to the monastery.\nPreviously, the Rega river flowed into Resko Przymorskie, and the remnants of its former bed form the Old Rega. There was a port called Regoujście by the lake, and commercial navigation took place on the river. The port was under the administration of Trzebiatów and posed competition to Kołobrzeg. According to some sources, in 1456, the inhabitants of Kołobrzeg attacked Regoujście militarily, sinking ships with a cargo of stones in the port, thus cutting off Trzebiatów from access to the sea. According to others, it was a storm that sank the ships, destroying the port. The following year, the people of Trzebiatów dug a canal, through which the Rega has since flowed into the Baltic Sea at the port in Mrzeżyno. The new port in Mrzeżyno operated until 1497, when storms sank the ships anchored there, rendering the harbor unusable until 1538.\nDuring the pre-war period, an observation post (German: Naturwarte) was established by Artur B.G. Butz by Lake Resko. However, the initiative ended in scandal due to \"stolen literature\", and after intervention by the gendarmes and the Prussian Central Office for the Preservation of Natural Monuments (German: Prussischen Zentralstelle für Naturdenkmalpflege), the facility was discredited.\nUntil 1935, about 0.5 km upstream from the mouth of the Old Rega into the lake, there was a fishing village called Kamp, where cottages covered with thatch stood. In 1936, the construction of a barracks settlement and a maritime airport for the Rogowo garrison began. Resko Przymorskie was utilized by the reconnaissance aviation regiment stationed here, whose seaplanes took off and landed on the lake. A large concrete square remains on the northern shore, from which concrete strips extend toward the sea and the lake.\nIn 1945, Resko Przymorskie was used as a landing site for German Air Force's seaplanes. In early spring (most likely in the last days of March), when the Red Army troops reached the shores of the lake from the east, a German transport aircraft, the Junkers Ju 52, appeared with the intention of landing. When the pilot realized he was right on the front line, he attempted to take off, but the aircraft was hit by Soviet artillery fire. The Junkers crashed into the lake a few dozen meters from the shore held by the Germans, who, despite the shelling, attempted to retrieve the aircraft from Resko. Steel cables were attached to tanks in an attempt to wrap around the cockpit protruding above the surface of the lake. This action failed, and the aircraft sank. German prisoners later testified that the transport aircraft had departed from Kaliningrad and was carrying an extremely valuable cargo. In August 1946, there was an unsuccessful attempt by Soviet soldiers to salvage the aircraft, during which it broke in half. The body of a soldier in a general's uniform with German distinctions emerged from the cockpit.\nYears later, the former commander of the Red Army unit, Colonel I.G. Nowikow, wrote a letter to the head of the Kaliningard group responsible for searching for looted works of art. He described the events related to the sinking of the aircraft in Resko Przymorskie along with a map and suggested that the sunken Junkers may contain crates with the Amber Room. After Nowikow's death, in 1987, the lake bed was examined in an attempt to find it. A Polish-Soviet expedition comprised divers from the Voronezh club \"Rif,\" Polish soldiers, and scouts. The group leader, Boris Waszkiewicz from the Polish Scouting Association, explained that despite using trawls, ejectors, magnetometers, and military equipment, they encountered many difficulties, particularly with visibility and a three-meter layer of silt. After many days of searching, they brought to the surface several small fragments of the front part of the aircraft, as well as part of a silver tableware set, a pendant, and a wedding ring. Documents and food ration cards from the pilot's cabin were also found, confirming that the aircraft had flown from Kaliningrad. However, the divers were unable to reach the second part of the broken aircraft – the cargo hatch.\nThe Polish Press Agency reported that on 18 August 1989, another search for the remains of a German aircraft in Resko Przymorskie began. In contrast to the previous version about the seaplane model, it was stated that the sunken aircraft was a Dornier Do 24.\nAt the beginning of May 2009, during a three-day diving expedition in Lake Resko Przymorskie, divers found elements of a German aircraft from World War II. Mirosław Huryn, the CEO of the Museum-Fort \"Rogowo\" Foundation, stated that many indications suggest that the found parts are fragments of a German seaplane, the Dornier Do 24. This aircraft most likely carried 72 German children and caregivers, who were attempting to evacuate on 5 March 1945, from a nearby airfield to Stralsund, Germany. The plane was hit in the engine by Soviet artillery fire and crashed into the lake, in front of thousands of other children and caregivers gathered at the airfield. No one survived this tragedy. A monument erected in the early 21st century commemorates the victims of the crash.\nUntil 2001, a significant part of Lake Resko Przymorskie and the area of the spit from the bridge over the canal in Dźwirzyno were inaccessible to the civilian population due to military use of the area.\n\n\n=== Hydronimics ===\nLinguist Mikołaj Rudnicki proposed the name Resko to designate the Camp lake (Polish: kęp(a)) when studying the etymology of the name of the Rega river in 1935. He indicated that derivatives of the river's name include Resko (jezioro) ≤ *Režъsko jezero, similar to Łeba and Łebsko.\nThe name of the lake was recorded in 1680 as Campische See and in 1789 as Campsche See.\nThe name \"Resko Przymorskie\" was officially introduced in 1948 when the previous German name of the lake, Kamper See, was changed. The previous name originated from the name of the fishing village Kamp. The current name is related to the Rega river and its coastal location.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nZarząd Portu Morskiego \"Mrzeżyno\". \"Zdjęcie jeziora z lotu ptaka od zachodniej strony\". port.mrzezyno.pl.

        "content": "The Volga-Kama Commercial Bank (sometimes Volzhsko-Kamsky Commercial Bank, Russian: Во́лжско-Ка́мский коммерческий банк), often referred to simply as the Volga-Kama Bank, was a major commercial bank of the Russian Empire. Founded in 1870, it was Russia's largest private-sector bank by total assets at the start of the 20th century.: 43  In late 1917 following the Russian Revolution, like all other commercial banks in Russia, it was absorbed into the State Bank with no compensation to its shareholders. Its name refers to the rivers Volga and Kama.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe bank's charter was approved by Alexander II on 24 February 1870, establishing as a joint-stock company with an initial authorized capital of 6 million rubles. The founders were a group of manufacturers and merchants led by Vasily Kokorev, who became its chairman in 1878.\nFrom 1879 to 1917, the bank was near-continuously led by Alexander F. Mukhin, successively as director, member of the board, and eventually chairman, with only a six-year gap in 1906–1912. From 1907 to 1911 the managing director of the bank was Pyotr Bark, who later became Russian Minister of Finance.\nBy 1899, the Volga-Kama Bank had branches in Astrakhan, Baku, Kazan, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Orenburg, Perm, Rostov-on-Don, Rybinsk, Samara, Saratov, Simbirsk (later Ulyanovsk), Suzdal, Tashkent, Tsaritsin (later Volgograd), Ufa, Vyatka (later Kirov), and Yekaterinburg. By 1914, it had a network of 60 branches in the Empire, the majority in the Volga Region and the Urals. By then, its place  among Russian commercial banks had declined to sixth rank.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSaint Petersburg International Commercial Bank\nAzov-Don Commercial Bank\nRusso-Asiatic Bank\nRussian Bank for Foreign Trade\nMoscow Merchant Bank\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Numerous municipalities and other local bodies in the United States have passed resolutions urging a ceasefire in the Israel–Hamas war. Richmond, California became the first city to pass such a resolution on October 25, eighteen days after the outbreak of hostilities. Resolutions are generally modeled after the Ceasefire Now resolution, introduced in the US Congress by Cori Bush, which also called for release of the hostages. At least 20 cities condemned the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel. Seventy cities had passed resolutions by the end of January 2024. As of March 2024, resolutions have passed in over 100 localities, including the major cities of Atlanta, Chicago, Dayton, Detroit, Minneapolis, Providence, Sacramento, Seattle, St. Paul, St. Louis, San Francisco, and Toledo.\nResolution proponents generally call for greater recognition of Palestinian rights, an immediate end to military hostilities, and the provision of humanitarian aid. The resolutions have been opposed by advocates for Israel who argue that a ceasefire would impede the Israeli military effort to defeat Hamas. In San Francisco, proponents included hundreds of Jews and Muslims opposed to the war.

        "content": "Anders Åkerman (1721 or 1723 – 1778) was a Swedish globe maker. He was the son of a carpenter and a woman who worked as a servant at a manor house. He studied mathematics in Uppsala University and learnt engraving. In 1758 he was engaged by a newly formed cosmographic society to produce terrestrial and celestial globes, with the purpose of propagating geographic knowledge and offering a cheaper alternative to imported globes. He produced a first model pair, consisting of a terrestrial globe and a celestial globe, in 1759–60. A smaller, second model pair was produced from 1762, and a third model pair, larger than the earlier two pairs, in 1766. Despite continuous support from several benefactors, the production never became commercially viable and suffered further setback following a fire which devastated Åkerman's workshop in 1766. He died destitute, though the workshop would continue to exist in changing forms for around a century. Åkerman was the first one to produce terrestrial and celestial globes in Sweden.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe appears to have been born in 1721 (or possibly 1723) on the countryside in present-day Nyköping Municipality. He came from a poor family; his father was a carpenter. His surname possibly derived from the nearby estate Åkerö Manor, where his mother worked as a servant. He married Kristina Österberg in 1753; the couple had a daughter and a son, who also became an engraver.He attended school in Strängnäs 1739–1747, and then enrolled in Uppsala University. He studied mathematics, but apparently he never graduated. In the meantime, he had started learning engraving in 1750, perhaps from Carl Bergqvist. From then on he produced mainly copper engravings for printing various ephemera for the university. He would continue producing engravings throughout his life. He made some portraits, including one of Carl Linnaeus. He also printed a hydrographic map of the Gulf of Finland and an atlas for children in 1768; the latter became a success and new editions appeared in 1774 as well as after Åkerman's death in 1807, 1810, 1813 and 1815. From 1757 he was employed by the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala as their engraver, and from 1758 active as a globe maker. Åkerman started the first production of terrestrial and celestial globes in Sweden, and has therefore been given the epithet the \"father of Swedish globemaking\".Despite receiving substantial aid from several benefactors, Åkerman struggled economically throughout his life. In April 1766, a fire devastated much of the city of Uppsala, and destroyed the workshop of Åkerman. He managed to salvage some material and could relatively quickly resume his work, but appears to have been psychologically broken after the event. He died destitute in Uppsala.Though never commercially viable, the globe workshop he had founded in Uppsala was contextually part of a scientifically very productive time in Sweden, during the second half of the 18th century. The workshop would continue to exist in somewhat changing forms for around a century. Fredrik Akrel, who had studied under Åkerman, was appointed as his successor by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1788.\n\n\n== Globe production ==\n\nIn 1758 a \"cosmographic society\" was formed in Uppsala (Kosmografiska sällskapet i Uppsala), consisting of several learned men, including chemist Torbern Bergman and astronomer Pehr Wilhelm Wargentin (who joined somewhat later). Among their aims was to start a domestic production of both terrestrial and celestial globes, in order to propagate geographic knowledge and offer a cheaper alternative than importing globes from abroad, and possibly even to create globes for an export market. At the time, globes had to be imported to Sweden mainly from the Netherlands, France, or Germany.Åkerman was engaged by the society to produce pairs of terrestrial and celestial globes in three sizes. He began working in 1758 and presented the first terrestrial globe in 1759. It had a diameter of 30 centimetres (12 in), equivalent to one Swedish foot at the time. The following year he had also finalised a model for a celestial globe in the same format. These first globes were not marked with a title or description, but contained a dedication in Latin to Carl Ehrenpreus, chancellor of Uppsala University, and also contained Åkerman's name. In 1760 he could present the pair to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, who expressed their satisfaction and granted Åkerman the privilege of using the title \"globemaker to the Academy\".With approval thus obtained, Åkerman established a workshop in Uppsala to produce the globes with the support of the society (not least the wealthy merchant and landowner John Jennings, who was a member). It employed around six or seven persons, with Åkerman himself probably handling the most delicate and scientific parts of the work. From late 1759, commercial production of the first model of globes was underway.\nSoon afterwards, the society commissioned Åkerman to expand the range, and in 1762 a pair of globes with a diameter of 11 centimetres (4.3 in) entered the market. Only one full set of these globes has been preserved. Of this globe type, one version was also constructed so that the celestial globe could be taken apart and the terrestrial globe fitted inside, a so-called double globe. The 11-cm globes were furthermore accompanied by a brief, printed instruction on the \"use and usefulness\" of globes, written by one of the members of the cosmographic society, astronomer Fredric Mallet. A third model of two globes with the diameter 59 centimetres (23 in) was finalised in 1766. These globes were more luxurious and have been described as Åkerman's most important globes.Contentwise, the terrestrial globes was made using mainly maps available to Åkerman in the collections of Uppsala University Library, including by cartographers Jean-Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville and Jacques-Nicolas Bellin. Information obtained from travelogues of recent voyages by George Anson and Charles Marie de La Condamine were also used as sources. Åkerman's first celestial globes were made with the aid of the star catalogues by John Flamsteed and Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille Åkerman had close contacts with the members of the cosmographic society, not least Mallet, who had a more thorough scientific knowledge and helped Åkerman to produce accurate globes. The globes were made of papier-mâché, which was covered in a layer of gypsum and then polished before engraved strips were applied to form the face of the globe. The larger globes, intended to be placed on the floor, were fitted in stands made in a Rococo style, painted red and decorated with brass details. One pair, made for the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, was fitted to a custom-made stand by the royal cabinetmaker Lars Almgren. The smaller globes were given simpler stands.Åkerman sold globes straight from his workshop; they were also sold through the university in Uppsala, and the office of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. Most were sold on the domestic market. One pair was given as gifts by the Academy of Sciences to the French Academy of Sciences; another three pairs were bought by the Russian Academy of Sciences and shipped to Saint Petersburg in 1771. Globes by Åkerman also found their way to University of Rostock, Märkisches Museum and Forschungsbibliothek Gotha, all in Germany.

        "content": "Louis \"Lou\" Lazarro (January 7, 1935 – May 1, 2000) was an American Modified racing driver.  Equally adept on both dirt and asphalt surfaces, he raced from Daytona to Canada, and is credited with over 250 feature wins in a career that spanned six decades.\n\n\n== Racing career ==\nKnown as \"the Monk\" to his fans, Lou Lazzaro started racing in 1952 at the Columbia Speedway near Utica, New York, when the driver of a Hobby class car he was crewing refused to help fix the car after a wreck.  Lazzaro claimed his first Hobby class feature event win in 1955 at the Brewerton Speedway NY, and by 1959 had joined with 3 other friends to field his signature maroon and white Modified, aptly numbered \"4\".\nThe quartet garnered their first Modified feature win the next year at Victoria Speedway NY.  Lazzaro went on to capture the 1962 and 1964 track championships at the venue, and over his career claimed four championships at the Fonda Speedway NY, three at the Utica-Rome Speedway NY, and one at the Albany-Saratoga Speedway NY.  The Monk also competed successfully at the Daytona International Speedway FL, the Syracuse Mile NY, and the Weedsport Speedway NY.\nLou Lazzaro suffered a stroke while racing at the Fonda Speedway on April 29, 2000, from which he did not recover.  He was inducted into the Eastern Motorsports Press Association Hall of Fame, the New York State Stock Car Association Hall of Fame, and the Northeast Dirt Modified Hall of Fame. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Maglić is a mountain situated in the central region of Montenegro, just 18 km north of the capital, Podgorica. Positioned on the Montenegrin side of the border with Bosnia, it has an altitude of 2,388 meters above sea level, standing 2 meters taller than its counterpart on the Bosnian side of the border.\n\n\n== Trnovačko Lake ==\nThe Montenegrin part of the Maglić massif has given rise to Trnovačko Jezero (Trnovačko Lake), acclaimed as \"one of the most stunning spots in Montenegro.\" Trnovačko Lake is a glacial lake situated at an altitude of 1,517 meters above sea level. It is 700 meters long and 400 meters in width within the heart of a \"vast amphitheater of rocky peaks.\" The lake is drained from the area around the mountains Maglić, Volujak and Bioč. The waters have a greenish-blue coloration. The sources of the river Sutjeska originate in the canyon regions of Maglić. The mountain is encircled by the Sutjeska river to the north and west, Mount Volujak to the southwest, the rivers Drina and Piva to the east, and the Mratinjska Uvala Valley to the south. Ascending Maglić presents a formidable challenge.\n\n\n== Forests ==\nThe rich forests on the mountain side consist of Perućica, a protected area within the Sutjeska National Park, and it is the oldest and one of the last remaining primeval forests in Europe. On the northwestern slope of the mountain, thick coniferous and beech trees grow up to 1,600 meters above sea level, while the slopes are very steep, barren, and rocky in other directions. Pastures are found at heights above 1,600 meters on the plateaus. The summit of the mountain is accessible through the national park and is visited by mountain climbers and nature enthusiasts. Most routes to the top require two days of hiking. Ascending to the peak of Mount Maglić is only possible on the southern side, which has rich vegetation of grass and mountain pine. From the mountaintop, there are scenic views of Volujak, Bioč, Trnovačko Lake, and Durmitor (in Montenegro), as well as over the Bosnian mountains in the northern and northwestern directions.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nThe climate in the area is humid and subtropical. The annual average temperature in the region is 12 °C. The warmest month is July, with an average temperature of 24 °C, and the coldest is December, with 1 °C. The average annual precipitation is 2,587 millimeters. The rainiest month is January, with an average of 347 mm of precipitation, and the driest is August, with 65 mm of precipitation.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Rockabye Baby\" is a song by American rapper Joey Badass, released on April 7, 2017, from his second studio album All-Amerikkkan Badass (2017). It features American rapper Schoolboy Q. Produced by Chuck Strangers and 1-900 with uncredited co-production from Jake Bowman, the song samples \"Is It Him or Me\" by Jackie Jackson and \"Blue Stone\" by Janko Nilović.\n\n\n== Composition and lyrics ==\nThe production features New York style boom bap percussion accompanied with a piano loop, while the lyrics condemn discrimination against Black people, including institutional racism. Joey Badass raps the first verse, in which he compares himself to Muhammad Ali in his prime, before calling for peace among rival gangs such as the Crips and Bloods and revolution. He also takes aim at the President, saying \"Fuck Donald Trump\". The section between artists' verses contains a guitar riff, over which Schoolboy Q begins the next verse. He discusses gang culture in the East Coast such as Brooklyn and inner-city struggles, in addition to reflecting on the history of racism against Blacks in the United States.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThe song received mostly positive reviews. Rebecca Haithcoat of Pitchfork stated, \"In the past, Bada$$ has taken some heat for his affinity for throwback production, but this grimy, driving, unmistakably New York boom-bappy beat serves their well. Q's whipped his style into shape, the whisper of smoke in his voice turning to gravel, the glint of playfulness in his eye going cold and his flow hardening up. It would be refreshing if occasionally Q would relax that tensed fist and allow his old singsong cadences, humorous ad-libs and melodic hooks to breathe, but on a track as flinty as 'ROCKABYE BABY,' doubling down on the edge works especially well. On the other hand, Bada$$ tends toward a looser, more laid-back delivery, but here, he sounds invigorated, ready to pounce. If ever we needed rappers riled up, it's now. May others take note.\" Hypebeast's Davis Huynh described the verses as \"sharp\" and \"witty\" and the production as \"silky\". Clash's Jonathan Hatchman regarded the song as among the \"stronger\" collaborations from All-Amerikkkan Badass, further writing \"although Joey Bada$$'s flow is, once again, superior, the overall aggressive tone ties the verses together\". Eric Diep of HipHopDX called it the \"winner out of his collaborative effort\" , adding \"But more importantly, Joey sounds right at home in Q's dark environment, with their unbounded chemistry setting them up for a bigger fan reaction if they cut another record together.\" Spin's Brian Josephs commented it could have been a bonus track on Blank Face LP. Patrick Taylor of RapReviews described Schoolboy Q's verse as \"fierce\". Jack Doherty of Drowned in Sound was less favorable of the song, describing it as \"surreally sleazy\" and commenting \"Everything seems to be going in slow motion, it’s like you've decided to nibble some DMT at an anti-Trump rally. Everything is a bit confusing, you feel a bit queasy, but deep down you know, despite what the drugs might be telling you, that you're on the right side of the fence.\"\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sybil Eaton (17 February 1897 – 6 September 1989) was a British violinist and violin teacher. Eaton was a performer and coordinator for the Music Travellers, a wartime initiative created by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts.\n\n\n== Life ==\nSybil Evelyn Eaton was born in Stamford, Lincolnshire on 17 February 1897. She was related to Elizabeth Browning on her father's side. She began learning piano aged six, and the violin aged eight. In May, 1914, she attended Leopold Auer's summer school at Loschwitz, and though prevented from continuing to study under him, at home in England she spent six years learning from Editha Knocker. Eaton performed to acclaim in 1917, when she gave three recitals. Soon after, she appeared at the Promenade Concerts and the Royal Albert Hall. The Annual Register of 1917 wrote that \"the arrival of two violinists so capable as Sybil Eaton and Tessie Thomas should assuredly be recorded\".\nBetween 1920 and 1923, ill health caused Eaton to retire from public work.\nEaton also formed a string quartet, which gave fortnightly recitals for schools at the BBC.\nA 1982 profile of Eaton in The Strad wrote that there could be \"few musicians in this country so universally loved by professionals and amateurs alike as Sybil Eaton\". Charles Villiers Stanford, Herbert Howells, Armstrong Gibbs, Pamela Hind O'Malley, and Gerald Finzi all composed pieces for her.\n\n\n== Wartime and The Music Travellers ==\nEaton was involved in the Rural Music School movement founded by Mary Ibberson in 1929, including with the Wiltshire Rural Music School During World War II, the movement helped to inspire the introduction by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts of the \"Music Travellers\" - intended to raise morale among the British population. Under the auspices of the Rural Music Schools, the Music Travellers were led by Eaton. Concerts were arranged in teacher training colleges, and visits by the London Philharmonic and London Symphony Orchestras to smaller towns and industrial areas were organised. A start was made in sending soloists or small groups of instrumentalists to factory canteens.\nThe Music Travellers were described as being \"remarkably successful in... efforts to make music and to help music to be made\". During the first six months of 1940, The Music Travellers started 37 new orchestral groups and 244 new choral groups, as well as helping to organize 254 concerts and festivals, attended by over 40,000 people.\n\nThe Music Travellers were cut significantly in 1943, and disbanded the following year, when they were replaced by regional officers. Eaton wrote of her disappointment at the end of the project:The cut in money for direct concerts is a shattering blow... Now, having created the demand, mobilised the enthusiasts and built up audiences, the cut has come, without warning... It will strain all our loyalty to CEMA to explain the sudden change without causing bitter resentment, and it will take all our courage to go on, refusing people we have taught to ask, breaking promises wholesale, with our dream of taking music to our whole region shattered.In 1945, a concert was held in Eaton's honour, featuring the Menges String Quartet and Margaret Ritchie. Ralph Vaughan Williams and Steuart Wilson spoke in praise of Eaton's work for music during the war.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nIn his 1982 autobiography, composer Christopher le Fleming wrote:For us in Wiltshire, as for so many elsewhere, Sybil Eaton will long be remembered with affection and admiration. The combination of brilliant and eloquent playing, allied to charm of manner, provided the essential vitamins needed to encourage the often difficult task of getting small isolated instrumental groups ‘off the ground.’ Sybil would offer two or three days and, in exchange for transport and hospitality, play to school and village audiences.Sybil Eaton died on 6 September 1989. A memorial service was held at the Savoy Chapel was held in October. A collection of her papers were donated to the Dartington Hall Archive, and are held by the Devon Heritage Centre.\n\n\n== References ==",

He won the gold medal at the first FIS Freestyle World Ski Championships in 1986 and the FIS Junior World Championship 1980 in Chamonix and ended his competitive sports career right after when he became the World Champion at the age of 26. Schabl achieved a total of 12 victories in the World Cup and won the ski ballet Crystal Globe in 1983 and 1984 seasons. He invented the one-handed pole flip and owns a unique world record 22 flips in 60 seconds on a ski deck (a revolving carpet). He is also a two-time European Champion in ski ballet, winning the title in 1981 and 1984.\nUpon his retirement, Schabl began working on ski films as a producer and actor, and later worked as a photographer for various magazines, including Playboy and Maxim. His feature film project about the Kaprun disaster, Smoke in the Tunnel, has been in production for more than 10 years and scheduled to be released on the 25th anniversary of the catastrophe, 11 November 2025.\n\n\n== Freestyle skiing results ==\n\n\n=== World Championships ===\n1 medal – (1 gold)\n\n\n=== World Cup ===\n\n\n==== Season titles ====\n2 titles – (2 ski ballet)\n\n\n==== Season standings ====\n\n\n==== Race podiums ====\n12 victories\n28 podiums\n\n\n== References ==\n\nhttps://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Schabl\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nRichard Schabl at the International Ski and Snowboard Federation",

The last placed two teams in each group would be relegated.  \n\n\n== Group 1 ==\n\n\n=== Teams ===\n\n\n=== Final league table ===\n\n\n== Group 2 ==\n\n\n=== Teams ===\n\n\n=== Final league table ===\n\n\n== Group 3 ==\n\n\n=== Teams ===\n\n\n=== Final league table ===\n\n\n== Promotion play-offs ==\n\n\n=== Qualifying Round ===\n\nYF Juventus win 7–2 on aggregate.\n\nRapperswil-Jona win 8–2 on aggregate.\n\nDelémont win 5–2 on aggregate.\n\nChiasso win 3–1 on aggregate.\n\n\n=== Final round ===\n\nDelémont win 5–3 on aggregate and achieve peomotion.\n\nChiasso win 3–0 on aggregate and achieve peomotion.\nChiasso are declaired 1.

        "content": "The Wildhearts are a British rock band from Newcastle upon Tyne. Formed in 1989, the group originally consisted of vocalist Stuart \"Snake\" Neale, guitarists Ginger (real name David Walls) and C.J. Wildheart (real name Chris Jagdhar), bassist Julien \"Joolz\" Dean, and drummer Andrew \"Stidi\" Stidolph. After several early lineup changes, Ginger took over as lead vocalist and has remained in this role ever since. The current lineup of the Wildhearts also includes bassist \"Random\" Jon Poole (who first joined in 2003, and most recently rejoined in 2024), alongside 2024 additions Ben Marsden on guitar and Pontus Snibb on drums.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1989–1999 ===\nGinger formed the Wild Hearts in August 1989. The original lineup featured vocalist Stuart \"Snake\" Neale, guitarist Chris \"C.J.\" Wildheart, bassist Julien \"Joolz\" Dean and drummer Andrew \"Stidi\" Stidolph. The band went through a number of personnel changes during 1990 and 1991: first, Pat \"Panache\" Walters replaced Stidolph; in the summer of 1990, Neale briefly left and was replaced by Dunken Francis Mullett; in March 1991, Neale left permanently and the group became a four-piece with Ginger on vocals; and in mid-1991, Danny McCormack replaced Dean. By October 1991, Walters had been replaced by Bam Ross, with whom the group recorded Mondo Akimbo a-Go-Go and Don't Be Happy... Just Worry; around the time of the latter's November 1992 release, Ross was replaced by the returning Stidolph.\n\nWith Stidolph back in the band, the Wildhearts released Earth vs the Wildhearts in 1993, before Ritch Battersby took over on drums that October. His first recordings with the band were the 1994 single \"Caffeine Bomb\" and second album Fishing for Luckies. Early the same year, keyboardist Willie Dowling – who had previously performed on Earth vs the Wildhearts – joined the Wildhearts' touring lineup. In July, C.J. was fired from the Wildhearts due to \"personal reasons\", with Ginger claiming: \"We fell out on the last tour and haven't really got on for the last two years.\" In his place, former Vai guitarist Devin Townsend joined as touring guitarist. Dowling played his last show with the Wildhearts at Reading Festival in August 1994, while Townsend remained for a European tour supporting Suicidal Tendencies in September.\nThe Wildhearts returned in early 1995 with temporary touring guitarist Mark Keds, who remained until July when he was fired for failing to turn up for a show. After a short period performing as a trio for the first time, the band introduced Jef Streatfield as C.J.'s permanent replacement in October 1995, who debuted on Endless, Nameless. Upon the album's release in October 1997, Ginger decided to disband the group due to drug addiction problems amongst certain band members. After their breakup, the band reformed on two occasions – first in October 1998 for a short tour of Japan, and again in August 1999 for a one-off show in the country.\n\n\n=== 2001–2022 ===\nAfter Ginger teased a reunion a couple of months earlier, in April 2001 it was announced that the Wildhearts would return for a string of UK shows that June. The lineup was completed with the additions of guitarist C.J. Wildhearts, bassist Danny McCormack and drummer Andrew \"Stidi\" Stidolph, marking a reunion of the Earth vs the Wildhearts incarnation of the group. Early into the first tour, however, McCormack was forced to leave due to ongoing problems with heroin addiction, with Toshi Ogawa temporarily taking his place. By late August, McCormack had returned to the band. Due to the bassist's ongoing struggles, however, Ginger performed bass on the band's next album, 2003's The Wildhearts Must Be Destroyed. During a tour in April 2003, prior to the album's release, McCormack left again to enter rehabilitation, with \"Random\" Jon Poole taking his place.\n\nWith new bassist Poole, the Wildhearts toured until the end of 2004. In early 2005, Ginger briefly joined Brides of Destruction, although assured that the Wildhearts were not breaking up. The band returned in July, with Ginger and C.J. reuniting with McCormack and drummer Ritch Battersby for a one-off performance at In the Castle festival in September. A year-long unofficial hiatus followed, before the band were joined by bassist Scott Sorry in November 2006, with whom Ginger had briefly worked in Brides of Destruction. Sorry performed on 2007's The Wildhearts, 2008's Stop Us If You've Heard This One Before, Vol 1. and 2009's ¡Chutzpah!, before the band went on another hiatus when Ginger joined Michael Monroe's solo touring band. Ahead of a return gig in December 2012, Sorry was replaced by the returning Poole.\nSorry returned in November 2013. Ahead of a P.H.U.Q. anniversary tour in 2015, Poole returned again. After appearing as a guest during some of the band's encores, McCormack rejoined the band in early 2018 for the Britrock Must Be Destroyed tour. The band released Renaissance Men, their first album in ten years, in 2019. This was followed in 2021 by 21st Century Love Songs. By March 2022, the group had disbanded again due to \"ongoing issues within the band\".\n\n\n=== Since 2024 ===\nIn January 2024, the Wildhearts announced that they were returning for a show that June, unveiling a new lineup featuring returning bassist Jon Poole, new guitarist Ben Marsden and new drummer Pontus Snibb.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\n\n\n=== Former ===\n\n\n=== Touring ===\n\n\n== Timeline ==\n\n\n== Lineups ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Wildhearts official website",

        "content": "Gustavo Lino Adrianzén Olaya (born 25 October 1966) is a Peruvian lawyer, politician and diplomat who is currently serving as the Prime Minister of Peru since March 2024. Previously, he served as the 26th Permanent Representative of Peru to the Organization of American States from 2023 to 2024, and as well as the Minister of Justice and Human Rights under former President Ollanta Humalafrom April to October 2015.\n\n\n== Education ==\nHaving graduated in law from the University of Lima, Adrianzén pursued further studies at the University of Alcalá de Henares in Madrid. His academic journey included a focus on Human Rights in various international locations such as Geneva, Strasbourg, San José, and Florence. Additionally, he obtained a master's degree in Public Administration and Management from Madrid's INAP, along with a Diploma in Public Administration from the Complutense University, both located in the Spanish capital.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nAdrianzén began his political career in 2015 when he was appointed Deputy Minister of Justice and Human Rights. Only two weeks later, on 2 April, he was appointed Minister of Justice and Human Rights, replacing Fredy Otárola. In October, then Money Laundering Prosecutor Julia Príncipe claimed that Adrianzén tried to “gag” her by asking for explanations for her statements to the press regarding the investigations involving First Lady Nadine Heredia. Adrianzén was summoned to Congress to account for these allegations but resigned on 20 October to avoid impeachment. Príncipe was also relieved of her position.\nHe was appointed by president Dina Boluarte to the post of permanent representative of Peru to Organization of American States (OAS) on 23 February 2023. As ambassador, he expressed the \"unwavering and unwavering commitment of the government and people of Peru to the values\" of the OAS. He resigned in March 2024 following his appointment as prime minister by President Boluarte. \nOn 6 March 2024, he was sworn in as Prime Minister of Peru, following the resignation of predecessor Alberto Otárola for his controversial involvement in the hiring of Yaziré Pinedo whom he referred to as \"my love\" at the Defense Ministry.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 1941–47 FEF President Cup (Spanish: Copa Presidente de la Federación Española de Fútbol de 1941-1947) was a football competition organized by the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), who donated the trophy and organized the tournament. The tournament was held between 6 April and 4 May 1941, but one last match between Club Atlético-Aviación and Valencia CF, which was decisive for the final classification, was postponed and then various circumstances caused it to be delayed to 14 September 1947. It was won by Atlético, who was thus declared the winner six years after the start of the tournament, which makes the President Cup the longest tournament in the history of Spanish football.\nIt was contested by the champions of the League and the Copa del Rey and the two best teams classified after the champion in the 1940–41 La Liga, being therefore one of the precedents of the Supercopa de España (given its format with four teams, especially the format adopted by it in 2019).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Iberian Tournament ===\nIn the 1940–41 season, the Federations of Spain and Portugal agreed to play annually an international tournament of eight teams, the first four classified teams of the Spanish and Portuguese leagues, which would be called the \"Iberian Tournament\". The dates were established at the end of the respective leagues and, at least in Spain, before the Spanish Championship began, then known as the Copa Generalissimo. As a result, when planning the calendar, the corresponding space was left for this new international tournament between the greatest football teams in the Iberian Peninsula.\nThe international match between Portugal and Spain, held in Lisbon on 12 January 1941, served to clarify the conditions and details of such competition. The first official news was given by the general secretary of the Spanish Federation, Juan Antonio Sánchez Ocaña, through an interview in the Madrid newspaper Gol. In principle, it was agreed that it would be played by the Cup-type qualifying system. Groups would be formed for the first from one country would face the fourth from the other; the second with the third, and so on. In March 1941, the Spanish Federation completely ruled out going to a single eliminatory round, since this did not entail economic correspondence, which would be necessary to delve into the difficult problems of economic compensation in terms of box office and travel; each round would thus be a two-legged affair. The country that was going to host the final had been determined by draw: Lisbon.\nIt was learned that the Portuguese teams, given how their league was going, would be: Benfica and Sporting CP from Lisbon, FC Porto from the city of the same name, and Os Belenenses, also from Lisbon. In Spain, however, it was not so clear because the league was very competitive, but at that time were: Atlético-Aviación, Athletic Bilbao, Real Madrid and Valencia CF. Since RCD Espanyol and FC Barcelona were occupying the seventh and eighth position respectively, the Barcelona press did not even allude to such an \"Iberian Tournament\", but when Barcelona began its comeback in the last stretch of the league, things changed; and when they beat Madrid in Estadio Chamartín by 2–1 and ousted them from fourth place, they began to talk about it in the Mundo Deportivo, probably to the astonishment of their readers at whose eyes appeared a ghostly international tournament of which he had not had the slightest news until that moment.\nIn the return international fixture in Bilbao, however, the Portuguese, without explanation (possibly either due to financial problems by the Portuguese Federation or due to the very severe corrective of the 5–1 that Spain had given to the Lusitanians and that made them fear a bad image in said tournament), never mentioned such an international tournament again.\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nSuch a situation put the Spanish teams in difficulties, as they were going to find themselves with a costly void until those teams entered the Copa del Rey qualifiers. It was the clubs who moved quickly to propose another tournament, only with Spanish clubs, to cover the scheduled dates, but they were unable to reach an agreement due to Athletic Bilbao, who wanted to enjoy in that tournament the same benefits of \"the compensations\" that it enjoyed in the League, which represented no less than 25% of the box office of the venues that Athletic visited (possibly due the limited capacity at San Mamés, which had already led to protests from fans who had not been able to attend the international match with Portugal). The other teams refused such \"tax\" since they wanted everyone to assume their expenses and income, without any other obligation. During all of this, the Spanish Federation remained on the sidelines.\nWhen there was another proposal that it be a tournament of four regional teams, instead of four clubs, the agreement somehow made its way between the teams. In Madrid, it was called \"Tournament of Four\" and in Barcelona: Copa Clasificados, because the champion of the Copa Generalissimo, Valencia CF, and the top three in the league championship took part: Club Atlético-Aviación as champion, Athletic Bilbao as runner-up and FC Barcelona as fourth in the league, because the third-place was Valencia. The teams paid for the trophy to be contested, each contributing the amount of 1,000 pesetas to pay the 4,000 that a cup costs in accordance with the entity of such competition.\nThe Portuguese League finished when this \"President Cup\" was going to start. They also had some empty dates left so they had no choice but to organize a tournament between their aforementioned teams and with the title of \"Easter Cup\".\n\n\n== Tournament ==\nIt was played in a round-trip league format, with a total of twelve games (six per participating team). On the first matchday on 6 April 1941, the tournament already presented two extreme opposites, the thrill of an 8-goal classic between Athletic Bilbao and FC Barcelona and the disappointment of a postponement between Atlético-Aviación and Valencia CF. While the directors were discussing \"whether they were greyhounds or hounds\", Real Madrid and Valencia reached an agreement to hold two friendly matches, one in each city. Madrid went to Valencia the previous Sunday where they won 2–1 and the second leg was to be played on 6 April. Valencia tried to fix the return fixture, but the price demanded was too high since Madrid had already launched, several days before, all the advertising and ticketing; it was more economical to hold the match than to pay all those expenses incurred by Madrid. Valencia came to Madrid, thus postponing its participation in the \"President Cup\", which in Madrid was still called \"Tournament of Four\"; Valencia lost again, this time 3–2, and was now free to join the tournament. Atlético-Aviación tried to cover the date with a trip to compete against Sevilla FC, but was unsuccessful.\nIn the second matchday, the two Atléticos, Madrid and Bilbao, comfortably defeated Barcelona (6–0) and Valencia (3–0) respectively, with Pruden scoring a hat-trick for the former and Unamuno for the latter. On the third matchday, the home teams, Atlético-Aviation and Barcelona had to come from behind to get points, with the latter's being a very violent match that saw two red cards in the first half due to mutual aggression, Jaume Sospedra of Barça and Carlos Iturraspe of Valencia, and another one in the second half, Mundo for an attempted attack on Antonio Anguera. There was a time when the teams were playing with just eight players on the field due to injuries. Two of them, Josep Valle and Poli, did not come out again, while the others, Mariano Martín, Vicente Asensi, and Lelé, spent several minutes on the sideline nursing the wounds, curiously, all to their heads. Naturally, the Competition Committee took action on the matter and financially sanctioned the clubs, the coaches, and the referee, who was suspended for a month; handing out sanctions to Benito (indefinite suspension until the extent of Poli's injury is known), to Sospedra (two-game suspension and a fine of 250 pesetas), and to Iturraspe (three games and a fine of 250 pesetas).\nThe following matchdays were less notorious, except for Bilbao's 6–2 victory over Atlético-Aviación, partly thanks to a hat-trick from Hermenegildo Elices. On the sixth and final matchday, Barcelona, which was already out of reach from the title, defeated Bilbao 3–0 to imprint them the same fate. On the other hand, Valencia defeated Atlético-Aviación 2–0, but both teams could still win the title due to their postponed match.\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== 1947 match ==\nThe end of the scheduled days had been reached without there having been an opportunity to resolve that meeting that had been suspended since the first day, which was decisive for the final classification, with a slight advantage for Valencia, for whom a draw was enough to win the title, but with the disadvantage of having to go to a foreign field. The Copa del Rey began right after the tournament, so the match was postponed to the first stages of the following season, but it ended up not being held. It was only six years later that the new president of the federation, Armando Muñoz Calero, urged for this to end once and for all. The newspapers had to remember and give their readers the clue of said tournament, its results and the importance of that match that had been so separated from its origins.\nThe \"final\" was finally scheduled to serve as the opening match of the 1947–48 season on 14 September. Their six years of competition remain in the history of Spanish competitions as the record for the duration of a tournament, exactly six years and five months from the first match, which was played on 6 April 1941, to the last, on 14 September 1947. Notably, it must be noted that almost everything was new. New Federation, since Saura had started it and Muñoz Calero finished it, leaving in between no less than two presidents, Javier Barroso and Jesús Rivero. One of the teams had started the tournament with the name Atlético-Aviación and ended it by calling itself Atlético Madrid, and the protagonists only had five \"survivors\": Alfonso Aparicio for the people of Madrid, and Juan Ramón, Asensi, Amadeo, and Mundo for the people of Valencia. The initial coaches were Ricardo Zamora and Ramón Encinas, but now they were led by Emilio Vidal and Luis Pasarín.\nAt the time, most players had extra pounds and less shape at the start of the season, and in Valencia, these defects were exacerbated by fatigue from a trip to Morocco from which they had just arrived. Both teams took advantage of the opportunity to test some recently acquired players, with Valencia testing goalkeeper Candi while Atlético tested José Luis Prado and Carlos Basabe. Atlético was better because they were interested in winning the cup; Valencia seemed to have forgotten about such a tournament and was not in a physical condition to generate that interest. The Madrid team thus won by a resounding 4–0 victory, and with a total of eight points, one more than the Valencians, they were declared the winner six years after the start of the tournament. The trophy was presented by Armando Muñoz Calero, the president of the Spanish Football Federation, who handed the cup to Atlético's team captain, Alfonso Aparicio.\n\n\n== Result ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nCopa Federación Centro\nCopa de los Campeones de España\nCopa Eva Duarte\n\n\n== References ==",

Though there were conflicting opinions from Holst's contemporaries about the work's merits, it has since come to be considered an attractive and exciting, if slight, example of Holst's later style.\n\n\n== Scoring ==\nThe Fugal Overture is scored for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets in B♭, bass clarinet, two bassoons, double bassoon, four horns in F, three trumpets in C, three trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion (one or two players), and strings.  There is an arrangement for piccolo, flute, oboe, cor anglais, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, two trombones, and strings; also a two-piano reduction.\n\n\n== Composition and early performances ==\nHolst began to write the Fugal Overture in the summer of 1922, composing for the most part in a soundproof room at St Paul's Girls' School, where he worked as a music teacher.  He initially intended it to develop into a ballet.  The full score was completed on 4 January 1923.\nThe overture was first performed on 14 May 1923 at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, by Eugène Goossens conducting the British National Opera Company Orchestra.  It served to introduce Holst's opera The Perfect Fool, also being premiered on that occasion.  The first concert performance was at one of Henry Wood's Queen's Hall Promenade Concerts on 11 October 1923, the composer conducting the New Queen's Hall Orchestra; it featured in the Proms again in 1949 and 1985.  The BBC broadcast the work for the first time early in 1924, and in 1927 the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Václav Talich performed it in Prague.\nHolst planned to record the work for the Columbia Gramophone Company, but this project came to nothing.  The first recording of it was made by Sir Adrian Boult and the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1967, issued by Lyrita the following year.\n\n\n== Style and structure ==\nThough called fugal by Holst and said by him to be a sonata, the overture is a somewhat unconventional example of both forms.  It was inspired by the counterpoint of J. S. Bach, and can be compared with the neoclassical works of Stravinsky, though, slightly antedating them, it can owe them no debt.\nThe Fugal Overture is divided into three sections.  The first has a precipitate fugal subject in 4/4 time with strong cross-rhythms, the eight quavers falling into a 3 + 3 + 2 pattern.  The second section is much slower, and includes a cello solo reminiscent of the sound world of Holst's later Egdon Heath.  The third section returns to the fugal subject of the first.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Fugal Overture met with a mixed reception in the 1920s and 1930s.  The Musical Times found it \"splendidly amusing\", The Times enjoyed its \"lively rhythms and vivid colour\", but on another occasion compared it unfavourably to the Fugal Concerto, saying it had \"less ideas in it...and such as it has have been better expressed by the composer before\".  R. W. S. Mendl called it \"an exhilarating piece of fun from beginning to end\", but Dyneley Hussey complained that both the Overture and Holst's almost contemporaneous Fugal Concerto were \"[p]erverse exercises in the contrapuntal style, devoid of any warmth and...real vitality\".  \nLater unfavourable judgements came from normally friendly critics.  Holst's daughter Imogen considered it \"unsatisfactory\", finding only in the central section a \"merciful deliverance\" from the \"noise\" of the fugue, which assaulted the ear; and Ralph Vaughan Williams, discussing Holst's music, admitted that it was \"not one of [his] favourite works\".  But there was also much praise.  The Times, reviewing a 1956 performance by Boult, thought he made a cogent case for it as \"an invigorating work that could effectively start any symphony concert\".  William Mann in 1967 thought it \"exhilarating\".  In 1974 Hugh Ottaway, in The Musical Times, wrote that though it was not a major achievement it was a lively piece, \"well worth hearing from time to time in place of some of the more hackneyed 'starters'.\"  In more recent years it has been called \"bracingly exuberant\", and \"a thrilling little piece...which feels like a 1920s equivalent of Short Ride in a Fast Machine.\"\n\n\n== Recordings ==\nLondon Philharmonic Orchestra, cond.

        "content": "The Palazzo dei Congressi, which was inaugurated as the Grand Hotel des Thèrmes in 1901, is a prominent hotel and building located on Viale Giandomenico Romagnosi in Salsomaggiore in the Province of Parma, Italy. The building is decorated in Liberty style and after being acquired by the commune in 1965, the site now hosts both civic entities such as the town library (Biblioteca Comunale Gian Domenico Romagnosi); a hotel management training school (Istituto Superiore G. Magnaghi); as well as serves as a small convention center.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe building was commissioned in 1898 by the Società Magnaghi, who engaged the designs of the architect Luigi Broggi. After the inauguration in 1901, the hotel was purchased by César Ritz and Baron Pfyffer.\nThe five-story building has a central core flanked by advancing wings. Originally built to have 300 rooms. The facade has a decorative brick layout, with horizontal rustication in the base but at the top floor, a lively frieze of floral tiles, designed by Gottardo Valentini.\nAfter the first world war, the hotel was ceded to the Società Anonima Grandi Alberghi Salsomaggiore, which enlarged the hotel and added new elaborate rooms, including the Salone Moresco, the Taverna Rossa, and loggia designed by Ugo Giusti and Galileo Chini. The latter also designed the eclectic decorations in neo-moorish style for the Salone, and of peculiar cariatids in another room. The artist Antonio Veronesi helped decorate the cupola of the Salone Moresco, with stain glass windows from the Chini factory of Borgo San Lorenzo. The sculptor Salvatore Aloisi created the stucco decoration. Finally Franco Spicciani created the lacquered tables and chairs of the Taverna Rossa.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"The Secret Of Master Cornille\" is a short story written by Alphonse Daudet.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nMaster Cornille's mill is the last one left in the region since a steam-powered flour mill was installed nearby. Although no one gives him any more wheat to grind he continues to make his family and the villagers believe that it is still in operation. He runs his mill empty, until the day his secret is discovered. He is disconsolate and believes himself dishonored. By empathy, the villagers decide to bring wheat to the mill. Master Cornille has tears of joy ; thereafter people across the region continue to regularly supply him with bags of grain... but eventually when Master Cornille dies, the last of the windmills fades away with him for ever.\n\n\n== Interpretation ==\nThe author invites us to reflect upon the moral challenges faced by people attached to their traditions in a constantly modernising and industrialised world. It reminds us of the importance of finding a balance between being open to material advantages offered by technology, all the while heeding the spiritual side of our roots and traditional ways of life.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFull text",

        "content": "The Lynn Theatre is a historic former movie theater on Pacific Coast Highway in Laguna Beach, California, United States. Walter J. Saunders of W. J. Saunders & Son designed the original structure. The Lynn opened in 1922 as a replacement for a former venue of the same name. An extensive renovation in 1935 introduced a new Mediterranean Revival style facade designed by James Neil Conway. The Lynn remained in operation under the founding family until the 1970s when Pacific Theatres acquired it. In 1976, the venue's single auditorium was split into two. Edwards Theatres and Regency Theatres later operated the Lynn until its closure in 2015. At the time, it was the only remaining movie theater in Laguna Beach. In 2023, the Lynn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and acquired by car manufacturer Rivian to be converted into a showroom.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1915–1935: Original two venues ===\nThe Aufdenkamp family founded and operated the Lynn Theatre. Fred Aufdenkamp was born in 1876 in Hanover, Germany, before immigrating to Nebraska in the 19th century and eventually the Greater Los Angeles region with his family. Aufdenkamp previously operated various entertainment venues, including a hippodrome in Redondo Beach and a makeshift bowling alley in Laguna Beach.In 1915, Aufdenkamp founded the original Lynn Theatre at 255 Forest Avenue in Laguna Beach, the first movie theater in the city. According to a later account from a former patron, admission was between 5 and 10 cents and the venue hosted approximately three showtimes per week in the summer. Fred's son, Lynndon \"Lynn\" Aufdenkamp, operated the hand-cranked projector that screened silent films. A generator provided electricity and theatergoers sometimes brought portable stoves for warmth on cold nights.In 1921, Fred Aufdenkamp announced his plans for a new 500-seat replacement venue that included a second-floor apartment for the family at a cost of US$10,000. The New Lynn Theatre opened in 1922 with a screening of the Robert Z. Leonard silent film Fascination. The New Lynn was dedicated by Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks. The venue also served as a theatre and vaudeville house, staging monthly productions produced by the Aufdenkamp family.On January 11, 1930, a rainstorm flooded Laguna Beach, causing extensive damage to the New Lynn Theatre. The water, which reached as high as four feet, damaged the organ and the woodworking. Theater owner Fred Aufdenkamp later sued the municipal government for its alleged mismanagement of stormwater diversion, seeking $3,700 in damages. The Orange County Superior Court awarded Aufdenkamp $1,300 in the case.\n\n\n=== 1935–present: Current venue ===\nIn 1932, Aufdenkamp purchased a lot adjacent to the second Lynn's north side, creating speculation that a third venue could be constructed. In 1934, he moved the second venue to a new location at 240 Ocean Avenue, where it would continue operation as the Lynn Ocean Avenue.With the original lot cleared, construction began on a larger venue for $50,000. The new site would include office space for Southern California Edison and a retail unit. It opened on June 26, 1935, with an early screening of the Lewis Seiler film Ginger. In 1937, it was renamed to the South Coast Theatre and came under new management with the Aufdenkamps retaining ownership of the property.In 1959, the Lynn Ocean Avenue was demolished, leaving the newer South Coast Theatre as the sole Aufdenkamp operation in town.Ownership of the venue changed hands for the first time in the 1970s when Pacific Theatres acquired the property. In 1976, the company divided the lone auditorium into two smaller auditoriums. Renovations also included new seats and refurbished bathrooms. In 1982, Edwards Theatres signed a lease to operate the venue.On August 30, 2015, the theater had its last day of operation with two showings each of the Joel Edgerton film The Gift and the Guy Ritchie film The Man from U.N.C.L.E. The operator at the time, Regency Theatres, said that the outdated technology in the venue made screening films expensive and difficult. At the time of closure, it was the only operating movie theater in Laguna Beach.On March 10, 2023, the Lynn Theatre was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The same year, electric vehicle manufacturer Rivian, headquartered in neighboring Irvine, began work on renovating and reopening the theater building as its first car showroom. The space opened on December 8, 2023, and includes a movie screen at the back of the building with programming selected by the Coast Film Foundation.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nWalter J. Saunders of W. J. Saunders & Son designed the second Lynn Theatre building, which opened in 1922. The facade was mostly nondescript with two sets of French doors and balconies on its second floor. Los Angeles–based architect James Neil Conway designed the third and final iteration of the theater, a Mediterranean Revival–style building with a distinctive tower and courtyard. The third building was constructed with concrete, brick, stucco, terra cotta, and ceramic tile.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Orange County, California\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Bassirou Diomaye Diakhar Faye (born 25 March 1980), commonly known mononymously as Diomaye, is a Senegalese politician and former tax inspector who has served as the 5th and current President of Senegal since 2024. He is the general secretary of the banned party PASTEF, who won the 2024 Senegalese presidential election in place of disqualified candidate Ousmane Sonko, whom he later appointed as Prime Minister of Senegal.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nFaye was born on 25 March 1980 in Ndiaganiao, in the western department of M'Bour, Senegal. He is a member of the Serer ethnic group from the noble Faye family. His middle name  \"Diomaye\" mean \"honourable\"  in Serer.  Faye has always claimed his rural origins, and \"imbued himself with educational and social values typical of his land, Ndiaganiao, in Serer country.\" His father, Samba Faye is a long-time member of the Socialist Party of Senegal, is quoted with saying that his son grew up with left-wing ideals. His grandfather fought for France during World War I as a Senegalese Tirailleur, and later was jailed following a dispute with French colonial authorities over his efforts to establish a district high school in Ndianganao which Faye later attended.\n\n\n== Education and early career ==\nHe went to primary school in his village and then undertook middle and high school in M'Bour. In 2000, Faye earned his baccalaureate. He successfully attained a master's degree in law in Dakar's Cheikh Anta Diop University and subsequently cleared both competitive exams, enrolling at the National School of Administration of Senegal (ENA) and the magistracy in 2004. After graduation, Faye opted to become a tax inspector in the Tax and Estates department, where he befriended Ousmane Sonko, a fellow alum from the same school. In 2014, Faye and Sonko's relationship grew closer in the Taxes and Estates Union, created by Sonko, the leader of the newly founded political party PASTEF. During his time at the head of the union, Faye campaigned to facilitate homeownership for tax and property agents.\n\n\n== Political career ==\n\nInitially a guest when PASTEF was founded, Faye swiftly ascended to become one of the most prominent figures within the party. He would go on to become one of the ideologues and designers of Sonko's program for his candidacy in the 2019 Senegalese presidential election. Sonko gained almost 16% of the vote and came third. In February 2021, Faye became the general secretary of PASTEF after Sonko was arrested, being accused of repeated rape by a massage parlor employee. As part of its strategy to win power, Faye attempted to unite the opposition for the 2022 elections, winning 56 seats under the alliance Liberate the People. At the same time, Faye ran unsuccessfully to become mayor of Ndianganao.\n\n\n=== Imprisonment and release ===\nOn 14 April 2023, Faye was apprehended as he exited his tax and property office on Rue de Thiong in Dakar. Subsequently, he was placed under police custody for charges including \"spreading false news, contempt of court, and defamation of a constituted body\" following a social media post he made. In this post, he denounced the perceived injustice within the judicial system, foreseeing a verdict that could potentially disqualify Sonko in a legal dispute between PASTEF and the Minister of Tourism, Mame Mbaye Niang. As the situation progressed, additional charges of \"incitement to insurrection\" and \"undermining state security\" were brought against him, resulting in an indefinite period of detention.\nAfter an attempt by incumbent president Macky Sall in February 2024 to postpone the elections, citing unresolved disputes over who could run, widespread protests erupted and the Constitutional Council of Senegal overturned the postponement. In response to the protests and overturning, Sall said that he would leave office as scheduled on 2 April, setting the election date on 24 March. He also expressed his willingness to release Sonko, Faye and all their supporters as an act of good faith. At the end of February, the government tabled an amnesty bill to calm the social and political unrest. Several hundred political prisoners were released by the government, and on 14 March, days before the election, Sonko and Faye were both released from prison.\n\n\n=== Presidential campaign ===\n\nAfter uncertainty over the possibility of Sonko being a candidate in the presidential election, PASTEF endorsed Faye in November 2023 as its candidate for the 2024 presidential election, despite him being detained. However, PASTEF had been banned several months earlier, meaning he was running as an independent. On 20 January 2024, the Senegalese Constitutional Council published the final list of candidates for the presidential election and Sonko did not appear there after several legal battles. Faye's candidacy was validated because he was never convicted although remaining detained. Sonko quickly announced his support to Faye for the election.\nOn 15 March 2024, a day after Faye's release from jail, he gathered hundreds of supporters at his first public appearance as a presidential contender.  Former president Abdoulaye Wade and his Senegalese Democratic Party (PDS) endorsed Faye on the same day, in a boost to his chances of winning election. The move came after PDS candidate Karim Wade was disqualified from contesting the race because he was a dual citizen at the time he submitted his candidacy. Cheikh Tidiane Dieye, another candidate in the presidential election, withdrew in favor of Faye.\nDuring the presidential campaign, he has promised to create jobs, campaigned strongly against corruption, and vowed to reexamine energy contracts. He ran under the slogan \"Diomaye mooy Ousmane\", which means \"Diomaye is Ousmane\" in Wolof, and expressed hope that Sonko's charisma and popular appeal among Senegal's youth would boost his campaign. Faye's program is similar with Sonko's for 2019. During the campaign, Faye released a declaration of his assets and called on other candidates to follow suit.\n\n\n== Presidency ==\nFaye was elected president after an election campaign that was marred by an attempt by the government to postpone the election, which was ultimately held on 24 March. Faye received over 54% of the vote, making him the first opposition candidate to have won an election in the first round since Senegal's independence in 1960. He was formally inaugurated on 2 April. In his inaugural address, Faye pledged to fight corruption and reform the economy. His first official act was to appoint Ousmane Sonko as Prime Minister of Senegal, who formally presented his government on 5 April.\nOn 3 April, Faye ordered an audit of the mining, oil, and gas sector, but insisted that investors were \"welcome in Senegal.\"\n\n\n== Political positions ==\nFaye says he believes in system change and left-wing pan-Africanism to reclaim Senegal's sovereignty, which some analysts believe is an allusion to intentions to distance the country away from Western powers, especially from the former French colonial empire. He also vowed to fight \"French economic stranglehold\" over Senegal if elected.\n\n\n=== Constitutional reforms ===\nFaye has promised to reduce presidential powers and reintroduce the vice presidency.\n\n\n=== Corruption reform ===\nFaye has claimed to prioritize fighting political corruption if he is elected president, saying: \"No country can develop when corruption and embezzlement of public funds are endemic.\"\n\n\n=== Currency ===\nFaye wants to stop the circulation of the CFA franc in Senegal, remove it as its official currency, and create a new national currency. In his program, he states: \"We will carry out a monetary reform that will allow our country to have its own currency.\" In a press conference, he added: \"There's no sovereignty if there is no monetary sovereignty.\" After concern from foreign investors, in March 2023 he said that \"Senegal will seek to implement a reform of the CFA franc at a regional level first and if that fails, will consider creating a national currency.\"\n\n\n=== Energy ===\nFaye believes in the renegotiation of contracts between the government and corporations in sectors ranging from energy to mining and fishing. He has also pledged to equally distribute profits out of a gasfield that is expected to start production in 2024.\n\n\n=== Military ===\nFaye aims to enhance the reputation and integrity of the defense and security forces through a concerted effort to combat corruption and inefficiency. This initiative seeks to ensure the optimal use of resources by implementing programs aimed at boosting the morale, motivation, and oversight of officers. Additionally, there's a commitment to raise the salaries of lower-ranking personnel. His program pledges to uphold the core identity of the Armed Forces of Senegal by advocating for a return to military principles, preventing their involvement in political affairs. Furthermore, the plan includes bolstering the air capabilities of the army through the procurement of strategic transport aircraft, such as the C-130, to fulfill external commitments effectively.\n\n\n=== Judicial ===\nFaye believes in the separation of powers, so that there should be no ties between the executive and the judiciary. His plan involves transitioning from the Senegalese Constitutional Council to a constitutional court, positioning it as the apex of the judicial structure. Additionally, in a bid to enhance accountability and fortify oversight mechanisms, he proposes abolishing political funds and substituting them with special funds allocated by the National Assembly for critical operations, such as arms procurement and clandestine missions. Furthermore, legislation will be introduced to safeguard whistleblowers, aligning with the principles outlined in the law on transparency in finance management in the public sector.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nFaye is polygamous and has two wives: Marie Khone Faye and Absa Faye. Marie Khone is a close relative of her husband, and together they have had four children: three boys and one girl. He has not had any children with Absa. Faye married Marie in 2009 and Absa in 2023.\nAccording to his declaration of assets that he released during his presidential campaign in 2024, Faye possesses a house in Dakar, as well as land outside the capital and in Ndiaganiao. He also possesses about $6,600 total in his bank accounts.\nFaye and Ousmane Sonko are close friends, Faye has even named one of his sons Ousmane in honor of their friendship. He had a traditional village upbringing and is Muslim. Faye also has a sister.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Bassirou Diomaye Faye at Wikimedia Commons\n Quotations related to Bassirou Diomaye Faye at Wikiquote",

        "content": "The Psalter–Hours of Yolande de Soissons is an illuminated manuscript produced in Amiens between about 1290 and 1297. It is currently kept at the Morgan Library in New York, accession number MS M.729.\n\n\n== Physical attributes ==\nThe Psalter–Hours contains 437 numbered folios of high quality parchment measuring 137 by 179 millimetres (5.4 in × 7.0 in). The text consists of nineteen lines per page in a space of 78 by 107 millimetres (3.1 in × 4.2 in). The script is Gothic textualis.\nThere are 39 full-page illustrations and 64 historiated initials, as well as many smaller miniatures and decorated initials. Many pages have full or partial decorative borders. Where borders incorporate miniatures or historiated initials they are invariably accompanied by roundels bearing coats of arms. There are around 400 such roundels in the manuscript, bearing six different coats of arms, four of which can be identified with those of the counts of Grandpré, Hangest, Moreuil and Soissons.\nThe manuscript was rebound in leather by Marguerite Duprez Lahey in 1927.\n\n\n== Texts ==\nThe Psalter–Hours starts with a calendar and a prayer. A psalter follows, occupying 164 folios (16r–179r), then ten canticles, a litany, twelve prayers, a lesson from the Gospel of John, two more prayers and two miscellaneous Marian texts (one on the Fifteen Joys of the Virgin). Three sets of canonical hours follow, occupying 123 folios (223r–345v). The Hours of the Holy Spirit and the Hours of the Virgin presented in parallel, followed by the Hours of the Cross. Two memorials for Saints Christopher and Claudius are included among the hours. The manuscript ends with the seven penitential psalms, the Office of the Dead, the Psalter of Saint Jerome and an office for Saint Michael.\n\n\n== Provenance ==\nAs its conventional name implies, the manuscript was long thought to have been created for Yolande de Soissons, who was related to all of the families whose coats of arms are found in the decoration. The original owner is represented at prayer in a full-page illustration wearing a cloak covered in one of the coats of arms. Karen Gould speculated that the arms were Yolande's. More recently Alison Stones argues that the coat of arms belonged to Comtesse de la Table, lady of Cœuvres. She was Yolande de Soissons's mother or stepmother.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==",

        "content": "Minimum Vital is a French progressive rock band founded in 1982 by the brothers Thierry and Jean Luc Payssan from Bègles near Bordeaux. \n\n\n== Style ==\nMinimum Vital's musical style is primarily instrumental with influences from jazz rock and folk music, combined with modern elements. The songs contain virtuoso harmonies and rhythms, accompanied by lush vocal textures reminiscent of art rock and Yes. There are also stylistic elements of traditional southern European, medieval and renaissance music, although the band has changed its style over the decades, it has remained true to classic progressive rock styles. Vocal parts are sung partly in French or as a mixture of different languages, some songs contain only words or syllables that fit the music, and a few tracks are sung in English.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1980, the 16 years old brothers Thierry and Jean Luc Payssan made their first amateur recordings of pop songs from the 1960s under the band name Rocking Chair. They later used the recordings to produce the LP Origi Redux under the band name Survival. Together with Eric Rebeyrol (bass guitar) and François Péron (drums), they founded the group Concept in 1982, but Péron left the band at the first concert in September 1983 and was replaced by Antoine Fillon. In 1984, flautist Anne Colas joined the band, with whom they won a competition in Mimizan, the first prize of which was the recording of a single at the Carat recording studio in Bordeaux. Audio engineer Philippe Ravon suggested the recording an entire LP instead of the single, but the studio was unable to find a record label for the album and wasn't able not finance the LP at its own. Instead, the group released the album Envol Triangles a compact cassette in 1995 at an edition of 500 copies. With this release, the group changed its name to Minimum Vital as a band named Concept already existed. After drummer Antoine Fillon and Anne Colas left the group, Christophe Godet followed as drummer.In 1988, Minimum Vital released the LP Les Saisons Marines on Musea Records founded by Bernard Gueffier and Francis Grosse. In 1990 the band released their first Compact disc album Sarabandes, which was recorded in Château-l'Évêque. In 1992 the first two Minimum Vital albums Envol Triangles and Les Saisons Marines were re-released on one CD. in the same year the album La Source was released, in which the Payssan brothers contributed more vocal parts than on earlier albums, they were supported by the singer Jaki Whitren. For their fifth album Esprit d'Amor, singer Jean Baptiste Ferracci joined Minimum Vital in 1996. In 1998, Thierry and Jean Luc Payssan started the side project Vital Duo and released the album Ex Tempore in 2001. Also in 2001 the Passians opened their own recording studio Vital Musique.In 2004 Minimum Viral released their sixth album Atlas. Charly Berna left the band and Didier Ottaviani took over the drums, but practically, the band was already in dissolution at this stage. The Payssan brothers continued to work as Vital Duo. In 2005, Jean Luc Payssan released his solo album Pierrots & Arlequins, and the two brothers and Eric Rebeyrol continued Minimum Vital without a drummer as a trio. in 2009 the album Capitaines was released.As the band members are no full-time musicians, there have been several longer phases in the band's history with no concerts or releases. Thierry is an architect, Jean Luc Payssan is a librarian and Eric Rebeyrol works as a system administrator at a school. In 2011, Thierry Payssan released his solo album Dans la Maison Vide.2016, Minimum Vital released the album Pavanes and in 2018 drummer Charly Berna returned to the band. 2019 the album Air Caravan was released.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n\n1986: Envol Triangles (Compact Cassette)\n1988: Les Saisons Marines\n1990: Sarabandes\n1992: La Source – Huit Chants de Lumière\n1997: Esprit d'Amor\n2004: Atlas\n2009: Capitaines\n2016: Pavanes\n2019: Air caravanLive albums\n\n1998: Au cercle de pierre\n2021: Minnuendö: Live 2021Compilations\n\n1992: Envol Triangles - Les Saisons Marines (RE-release of the first two albums)Singles and EP's\n\n1993: Danse Des VoeuxVideo albums\n\n1995: Les Mondes De Worlds Of Minimum Vital (VHS)\n2012: Chapitre 3\n2013: Au Cercle De Pierre\" & Autres Archives Live\n2016: Connexions\n2024: MINIMUM VITAL au festival Crescendo 2023\n\n\n=== Side projects ===\nVital Duo\n\n2001: Ex tempore\n2002: Le Jardin Hors du Temps (DVD)Jean-Luc Payssan\n\n2005: Pierrots et ArlequinsThierry Payssan\n\n2011: Dans la Maison Vide\n\n\n== Reception ==\nProg Archives highlights, that Minimum Vital has certainly its own individuality on the desk of progressive rock.

        "content": "The 1961 Jabalpur Riots were the first major-scale riot between Hindus and Muslims in post-Partition India, which erupted in the city of Jabalpur in the state of Madhya Pradesh. This riot was linked to the emergence of a small class of successful Muslim entrepreneurs who created a new economic rivalry between the Hindu and Muslim communities.\nThese riots shook Jawaharlal Nehru as he never expected communal riots of such intensity in independent India. Hindu nationalist organizations including ABVP, Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh played a major role in this riot. Officially 55 were killed, though according to unofficial accounts, 200 were killed. Nehru responded by lambasting the Bhopal Congress government which was being headed by Chief Minister Kailash Nath Katju. He angrily noted that Congress leaders were found to be 'sitting inside their houses like purdah ladies' during riots. \nThe Congress had adopted secularism as its main ideology but had admitted, right from the anti-colonial freedom struggle, all sorts of elements. Hardly a handful of few had strong secular convictions. Even among its top leadership, there were Hindu fundamentalist elements with anti-minority proclivities. In the 1960s – A series of riots broke out, particularly in the eastern part of India – Rourkela, Jamshedpur and Ranchi – in 1964, 1965, and 1967, in places where Hindu refugees from the then East Pakistan were being settled. In the later years, post-Nehru saw violent riots including 1969 Gujarat riots, 1970 Bhiwandi Riots. These riots gave political rise to Hindu fundamentalist forces, which played a major role in engineering them and benefitting from religious polarization.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe rioting in Jabalpur has largely been attributed to the emergence in the Muslim community, which had lost its political and business elite in 1947 Partition of India. Hindu industrialists and businessmen, faced with new competition were willing to resort to violence in order to preserve their position. The beedi (cigarette) industry in Jabalpur was dominated by Muslims in the 1960s. \nOn 3rd February 1961, a Hindu girl was raped by two Muslim boys named Maksood and Latif. One of them was the son of a Muslim beedi businessman. The Hindu girl ended up committing suicide. The Muslim boys were arrested that day and presented before the Magistrate. \nThe Yug Dharma, a local Hindi Daily, associated with RSS published the news of the rape incident with communal banner head-lines: “Hindu girl raped by Muslim scoundrel on point of dagger. The helpless student poured kerosene oil and burnt herself.\nAccused son of an industrialist. Sensation and tense atmosphere in the whole city”.\nThis newspaper was distributed in the town in the early hours of the 4th\nFebruary. Other local dailies also published the news but, relatively, not in that sensational strain. \nOn the morning of the 4th February, 1961 about 200 local students\ntook out a procession to condemn the rape incident. The procession was led by a Hindu nationalist organization ABVP. The procession turned violent, for which the Army had to be deployed. The Army brought the situation under control on the 5th. But on the 7th, after the Army had been withdrawn, Hindus attacked the town's Muslim quarters and shops. The violence continued till late night. According to the newspaper New Age, the riot was attributable to alarmist rumours spread by Yug Dharma , that the forces of law and order had been attacked by the Muslims. The premeditated character of the riots could be deduced by the fact that the Hindu houses and shops, situated within the Muslim quarters had been marked beforehand. So, the houses and shops of Hindus were spared, but those of Muslims were burnt and looted. Officially fifty-five people were killed, mostly Muslims. These riots caused huge losses to Muslim businessmen, and they lost their share of control of the beedi industry.\n\n\n== Nehru's reaction to the Riots ==\nIn a letter to chief ministers on 20 February 1961, Nehru referred to the “deplorable communal incidents occurring in Jabalpur and some other towns of Madhya Pradesh”. He referred to the “widespread attack on Muslims and their houses and shops” as being “pre-planned and organised”. He wrote, “Local newspapers fan the flames [and] communal organisations come to the forefront.” \nAfter the 20 February letter, Nehru wrote more comprehensively about the communal issue to chief ministers on 6 March of the same year. In it, he noted that the upsurge of communal violence in some places in Madhya Pradesh shocked him not merely because of the damage done to life and property but “even more so because it uncovered something that was painful to us”. He angrily noted that Congress leaders were found to be 'sitting inside their houses like purdah ladies' during riots. \nNehru formed the National Integration Council in response to the riots. However, the council remained mainly on paper and was not able to control riots in the future.\n\n\n== Congress and Secularism ==\nAfter Independence, many leaders in Congress only showed lip service to secularism and were openly committed to Hindu fundamentalist ideology on matters including temples, religious conversions, cow protection, and language and supporting fundamentalist organizations.\nIn 1948, the by-election was announced for Faizabad constituency. The city of Ayodhya was part of this constituency. Acharya Narendra Deva was running for the elections. He was a hardcore socialist as well as an atheist and had a liberal outlook. Congress fielded a sadhu named Baba Raghav Das against him. Govind Ballabh Pant, CM of U.P, well known for his conservative and Hindu fundamentalist views, went to Ayodhya and declared in his speeches that Narendra Deva didn't believe in the divinity of Lord Rama as proved by the fact that he didn't wear chhot or tuff of hair at back of head displayed by all devout Hindus. Baba Raghav Das distributed tulsi leaves to emphasize the spiritual difference between him and Narendra Deva. Ayodhya overwhelmingly voted for Baba Raghav Das and Congress won the elections by playing the Hindu card. \n\nOn the night of December 22-23, 1949, idols of Lord Rama were placed in Babri Masjid by Mahant Digvijaynath, who was arrested and jailed earlier for inciting the crowd to assassinate Mahatma Gandhi. Jawaharlal Nehru ordered its removal. The pushback to the Prime Minister’s orders came not just from then District Magistrate KK Nair and city Magistrate Guru Dutt Singh, but also from within the Congress in Faizabad. Congress MLA from Faizabad, Baba Raghav Das, was among those who vociferously opposed any move to remove the idol, even threatening to resign if that happened. Finally, the idols remained in the masjid and paved the way for  Ram Janmabhoomi movement\nKM Munshi, leader of Congress from Gujarat, talked about Gujarati Asmita or pride in his novels including Jay Somnath. He talked about Hindu identity and considered Somanath Temple to be part of it. He widely mentioned in his novels about how \"barbarious\" Muslim rulers like Mahmud of Ghazni destroyed it and Hindu identity was lost, which needed to be restored. The Somanath Temple restoration project received support from Sardar Patel. Jawaharlal Nehru requested President Rajendra Prasad to not inaugurate the temple. Nehru was against the idea of secular government associating closely with a temple function. However, still Rajendra Prasad, Sardar Patel, and KM Munshi participated in the temple inauguration. \nKM Munshi later became a founding member of Vishwa Hindu Parishad. His ideas of asmita or pride are widely believed to have influenced Gujarat, much more than Mahatma Gandhi himself.\nIn 1954, the Bharatiya Jana Sangh's launched the \"Anti-Foreign Missionary Week\", to protest against conversions by foreign Christian Missionaries. The agitation was suspended when the Congress government under Kailash Nath Katju set up a commission named Niyogi Committee to investigate religious conversions. In 1968, Madhya Pradesh passed its Dharma Swatantrya Adhiniyam (Religious Freedom Act) in 1968 enforcing \"prohibition of conversion from one religion to another by use of force or allurement, or by fraudulent means, and matters incidental thereto.\"\nGulzarilal Nanda, who served as Interim Prime Minister of India, founded Bharat Sadhu Samaj. The Bharat Sadhu Samaj was established in early 1956 after a meeting between Congress politicians and sadhus (Hindu ascetics) at Birla Mandir in Delhi. The Samaj was instituted on the belief – shared by Congress and Hindu ascetics – that these holy men would help popularize the Five-Year Plans among the country’s devout millions.\nBharat Sadhu Samaj’s first president, Tukdoji Maharaj, one-time Gandhian and singer would end up becoming one of the founders and vice-presidents of the far-right Hindutva group, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad. In the 1950s, several Congress governments enacted bans on cow slaughter in states including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh.\nOn November 7, 1966, Bharat Sadhu Samaj led a crowd of nearly 125,000 in a march from Red Fort to Parliament as part of a nationwide agitation to ban cow slaughter on national level. The marchers soon turned into a mob. Wielding trishuls, swords, and spears, they tried to breach Parliament. When repelled by police, they attacked the homes of Congress politicians and went on a rampage across the city, destroying property. The violence ended with eight dead, 40 seriously injured, and eight hundred arrests. \nGulzarilal Nanda founded the Shri Ram Janmotsav Samiti on Ram Navami in 1983 and became the founder of the Ram Janmabhoomi Movement along with Dau Dayal Khanna. RSS leaders also attended an event hosted by Nanda during this time. On April 7 and 8, 1984, a meeting of the Dharma Sansad of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, an RSS affiliate, was held at the Vigyan Bhawan, a top government-run convention centre in Delhi with support of Indira Gandhi. At this meeting, the organisation saw the announcement about launching a movement for the “liberation” of the Ram Janmabhoomi at Ayodhya, the Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi at Mathura, and the Vishwanath shrine at Varanasi. Gulzarilal Nanda supported the Dharam Sansad. \nIn 1960s, Mumbai had major influence of Communist parties and the frequent strikes and demands by workers had tired Bombay’s entrepreneurs to the core. At the time, the left parties were the only political challenge to the Congress and both its leaders and the businessmen who funded the Congress wished to see the back of the communist trade unions whose domination even the Congress-sponsored trade unions had failed to break. Congress leaders under Chief Minister Vasantrao Naik started supporting organization named Shiv Sena, which was little known at that time. Congress wanted Shiv Sena to cut into the vote bank of Communists by raising the regional and hindutva sentiment against that of workers’ unity. Shiv Sena had major role in religious based violence in 1970 Bhiwandi Riots against Muslims and caste based violence in 1974 Worli Riots against Dalits. It represented Hindu Nationalist ideology which received support from upper castes and Shiv Sena was also known as \"Vasant Sena\" because of the backing it received from Congress CM Vasantrao Naik.\nPurushottam Das Tandon, a Congress leader known for his Hindu nationalist image, openly declared in 1948 that 'the Muslims must stop talking about culture and civilization foreign to our country and accept Indian culture. Urdu symbolizes foreign culture and Hindi alone can be unifying factors for all forces in the country'. He played a major role in making Hindi language as Official Language of India.  Sampurnanand, second CM of UP and several Congress leaders vehemently opposed Urdu.\nCongress leaders, Arya Samaj and Jan Sangh vehemently opposed the demand of Punjabi Suba, a Punjabi-speaking majority state. The Hindu nationalist organizations asked the Hindus of Punjab to disown Punjabi and register Hindi as their mother tongue in the Census of 1961. Before that, Arya Samaj leaders and groups had run the campaign during 1951 Census. In 1955, Golden Temple was raided by the government to quash the movement. In 1966, the Government proposed to idea to create Punjabi Suba which led to clashes between Hindus and Sikhs in Delhi. Finally, on 1 November 1966, Punjab state was create with official language as Punjabi in Gurmukhi script.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was foudn in Kalri Lake, Sind, Pakistan.\n\n\n== Hosts ==\n\nThe life cycle of an acanthocephalan consists of three stages beginning when an infective acanthor (development of an egg) is released from the intestines of the definitive host and then ingested by an arthropod, the intermediate host. Although the intermediate hosts of Paraechinorhynchus are ???. When the acanthor molts, the second stage called the acanthella begins. This stage involves penetrating the wall of the mesenteron or the intestine of the intermediate host and growing. The final stage is the infective cystacanth which is the larval or juvenile state of an Acanthocephalan, differing from the adult only in size and stage of sexual development. The cystacanths within the intermediate hosts are consumed by the definitive host, usually attaching to the walls of the intestines, and as adults they reproduce sexually in the intestines. The acanthor are passed in the feces of the definitive host and the cycle repeats. There may be paratenic hosts (hosts where parasites infest but do not undergo larval development or sexual reproduction) for Paraechinorhynchus.\nP. kalriai parasitizes the rohu (Labeo rohita). There are no reported cases of P. kalriai infesting humans in the English language medical literature.\n\n\tHosts for Paraechinorhynchus kalriai\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ramona Parra Brigade (BRP) is the muralist brigade of the Communist Party of Chile (PCCh). It is named after Ramona Parra, a member of that party who was murdered in the Plaza Bulnes massacre in Santiago on January 28, 1946.\nIt was created in 1968 by resolution of the VI Congress of Communist Youth of Chile (JJ.CC.).\nIts first murals were created after a proposal by Pablo Neruda of Popular Unity (Chile). Later, its murals spread nationwide after Salvador Allende was named candidate for the 1970 Chilean presidential election. Their first murals were very simple, with irregular layouts using only one color and no background.\nThe goal of BRP muralists was to deliver meaningful messages to ordinary passersby. As a result of this, two characteristic aspects were developed: locating their murals in strategic areas, such as emblematic squares or marginal communes; and distinct iconography, such as the spike, the fist, the star, the birds and the workers.\nIn 1971 the artist Roberto Matta and the Ramona Parra Brigade, painted a mural called The first goal of the Chilean people, which is located in the old municipal swimming pool of the commune of La Granja. This mural has dimensions of 25 m long and 4 m high. It was covered in paint after the 1973 Chilean coup d'état, and was rediscovered in 2005 by thesis students from the University of Chile. After a long restoration (and fundraising) process, it was completed in September 2008.\nBecause some of its members were exiled abroad after the 1973 coup, there are several murals painted by the BRP abroad, including murals made in Amsterdam. In October 2018, one mural was discovered during the demolition of a building in the Osdorpplein neighborhood, which dates back to 1983 and refers to the dictatorial era of Chile. Valdivian artist Jorge \"Kata\" Nuñez claims there were around 60 murals painted in the city by members of the Ramona Parra Brigade.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Commemorative Medal of the Fiume Expedition (Italian: Medaglia commemorativa della spedizione di Fiume) was a decoration granted by the Kingdom of Italy to personnel who took part in the Italian seizure and occupation of Fiume (now Rijeka) after World War I. It originated in 1919 as the Commemorative Medal of the Ronchi March (Italian: Medaglia commemorativa della marcia di Ronchi), a decoration of the Italian Regency of Carnaro, and was adopted by the Kingdom of Italy in 1926.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn 26 April 1915, the Kingdom of Italy signed the Treaty of London with France, the Russian Empire, and the United Kingdom, under which Italy agreed to enter World War I on the side of the Allies with the understanding that if the Allies defeated the Central Powers, Italy after the war would gain control of the Austrian Littoral with the exception of Fiume (now Rijeka). Austria-Hungary disintegrated in October 1918, and the war ended in Allied victory in November 1918. At the postwar Paris Peace Conference in 1919, Italy, as promised in 1915, was granted the Austrian Littoral except for Fiume, which was incorporated into the new Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (which in 1929 was renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia).\nConsidering Fiume to be an Italian city and angered by the Kingdom of Italy's agreement to surrender it to foreign control, the Italian nationalist, poet, playwright, orator, journalist, and aristocrat Gabriele D'Annunzio, who had served as an officer and aviator in the Italian Royal Army (Italian: Regio Esercito) during World War I, led 2,600 so-called \"legionaries\" from Ronchi di Monfalcone in Italy to Fiume on 12 September 1919, an event known in Italy as the Impresa di Fiume (\"Fiume endeavor\" or \"Fiume enterprise\"). They succeeded in seizing Fiume the same day, and D'Annunzio immediately announced Italy's annexation of Fiume. (In honor of this achievement Ronchi di Monfalcone was renamed Ronchi dei Legionari in 1925.)\nThe Kingdom of Italy opposed D'Annunzio's actions, demanded that the plotters of the Impresa di Fiume surrender. and instituted a blockade of Fiume to pressure D'Annunzio into relinquishing control of the city. In December 1919, a plebiscite in Fiume decisively approved a modus vivendi Italy had proposed that month under which Italy would recognize Fiume's desire for Italian annexation and consider only the wishes of Fiume's population in future negotiations, but D'Annunzio, not trusting Italy to be able to fulfill its promises and unable to negotiate further Italian concessions, rejected the modus vivendi and instead declared Fiume to be under the control of the Italian Regency of Carnaro (Italian: Reggenza Italiana del Carnaro) with himself as Duce (\"leader\").\nOn 12 November 1920, the Kingdom of Italy and the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes signed the Treaty of Rapallo, which made Fiume an independent state as the Free State of Fiume. Claiming that the Treaty of Rapallo was illegal, D'Annunzio ignored it, and the Italian Regency of Carnaro declared war on Italy. After D'Annunzio refused an Italian ultimatum to surrender, the Italian armed forces attacked Fiume, resulting in the \"Bloody Christmas\" (Croatian: Riječki krvavi božić; Italian: Natale di sangue) clashes of 24–29 December 1920. These resulted in D'Annunzio's surrender and the establishment of the Free State of Fiume. The Free State of Fiume survived until 1924, when the Kingdom of Italy, by then under the fascist government of Benito Mussolini, annexed it and made it the Italian Province of Fiume.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Commemorative Medal of the Fiume Expedition originated as the Commemorative Medal of the Ronchi March, an unofficial decoration of the Italian Regency of Carnaro established by D'Annunzio immediately after the occupation of Fiume on 12 September 1919. Following D'Annunzio's precise instructions, the Italian painter, xylographer, illustrator, and photographer Adolfo De Carolis created a model of the medal. S. Johnson of Milan, Italy, used the model to mint the medals. By a royal decree of 31 January  1926, the medal became an official decoration of the Kingdom of Italy.\nTwo hundred examples of the first edition of the medal were minted and delivered in 1919 and 1920 to the legionaries who entered Fiume with d'Annunzio. A second edition was delivered between 1919 and 1936, and a third between 1937 and 1945. A total of 11,165 medals were produced. After World War II ended in 1945, additional copies of the medal were produced.\nIn 1935, D'Annunzio donated his medal, with three clasps, to the Kingdom of Italy along with other medals and a badge depicting a sword (in gold and silver) bearing the motto COSA FATTA CAPO HA (\"WHAT THE LEADER HAS DONE\"). A gold version of the medal awarded to Arturo Toscanini is preserved at the La Scala Theater Museum in Milan.\n\n\n== Eligibility ==\nEligibility for the medal initially extended to:\n\n\"Legionaries\" who arrived in Fiume in 1919 after taking part in the Ronchi march;\nThe crew of the Italian Regia Marina (\"Royal Navy\") troopship Cortellazzo who arrived in Fiume on 22 September 1919 and thereafter supported D'Annunzio;\nPersonnel who fought in the \"Bloody Christmas\" clashes between 24 and 28 December 1920;\nWell-known personalities who contributed in various ways to the Fiume cause.\nUnder the royal decree of 31 January  1926, the Kingdom of Italy extended eligibility for the medal to members of the Voluntary Militia for National Security (Italian: Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale, or MVSN), commonly called the \"Blackshirts.\" By royal decree of 15 July 1938, members of the Italian Armed Forces also became eligible for the medal.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\n\n=== Medal ===\nThe medal is a bronze disc with a diameter of 39 millimetres (1.5 in) and an inverted U-shaped attachment for the ribbon. On the obverse, the lower part of the medal depicts arms raising daggers with a Roman vexillum in the center supporting an eagle with spread wings in the upper part of the medal. On either side of the vexillum, the medal bears the Latin inscription \"HIC MANEBIMUS OPTIME\" (\"WE'LL BE FINE HERE\"), written on two lines as \"HIC – MANE\" on the upper line and \"BIMUS – OPTIME\" on the lower line, with the vexillum in between the two words in each case. The reverse bears the inscription  \"AI / LIBERATORI / XII-SETTEMBRE/MCMXIX\" (\"TO THE LIBERATORS 12 SEPTEMBER 1919\"), written across four lines, above a laurel wreath. The bottom edge of the reverse bears the insciption \"FIUME D'ITALIA\" (\"FIUME OF ITALY\") on an unrolled parchment. The medal does not bear signatures or brands to indicate its engraver or manufacturer.\nThe first-edition medals were not created with a homogenous minting process, and as a result they varied in weight from 36 to 41.5 grams (1.27 to 1.46 oz). They were minted with a green-black patina to give them the appearance of antiques as soon as they were minted. The second-edition medals were made of dark bronze, were brown or black in color, and varied in weight between 34 and 35 grams (1.2 and 1.2 oz). Third-edition medals also are made of dark bronze, range in color from dark brown almost black, and vary in weight between 30 and 33 grams (1.1 and 1.2 oz). Post-World War II copies of the medal vary in weight between 25 and 29 grams (0.88 and 1.02 oz).\nIn addition to the bronze medals, seven medals were minted in gold and awarded to:\n\nThe pennon of the \"legionaries\" who marched from Ronchi di Monfalconi to Fiume on 12 September 1919.\nGabriele D'Annunzio.\nPilot Captain Ernesto Cabruna, Italian flying ace who supported D'Annunzio's revolt in Fiume against the Kingdom of Italy;\nGiovanni Host-Venturi, Italian irredentist who created the \"Legion of Fiume\" in Fiume in 1919 to defend Fiume against French occupying forces who had taken a pro-Yugoslav stance and later was instrumental in organizing the Impresa di Fiume.\nAntonio Masperi, D'Annunzio's luogotenente (\"lieutenant general\") in Fiume.\nArturo Toscanini, Italian conductor who supported D'Annunzio by conducting the La Scala opera ensemble in Fiume in 1920 in one of its first stops on a marathon tour of Europe and North America.\nGuglielmo Marconi, who visited Fiume in September 1920 to convince D'Annunzio to leave but instead allowed D'Annunzio to board his yacht and broadcast a radio message from it to the world about the Fiume cause.\n\n\n=== Ribbon ===\nThe ribbon has three identical vertical bands of blue, yellow, and carmine, the colors of the coat of arms of the comune (\"commune\") of Fiume.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBrambilla, Alessandro (1997) [1985].

        "content": "Michael Stewart (born 1965) is a British-born Canadian Anglican bishop. He was consecrated in 2024 as bishop suffragan of the Anglican Network in Canada (ANiC) in the Anglican Church in North America, where he serves as area bishop for western Canada. He was previously in parish ministry in Abbotsford, British Columbia, where he participated in the Anglican realignment in the 2000s.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nStewart is a native of the United Kingdom. He studied for the priesthood at St John's College, Nottingham, and was ordained as a deacon in 1989 and a priest in 1990. He began his ordained ministry as curate at St. Paul's Church, Ealing, and then as vicar at St. Cuthbert's, North Wembley, for nine years. In 2002, Stewart and his family immigrated to British Columbia, where he became an associate priest at St. Matthew's Anglican Church in Abbotsford. Stewart is married to Marianne and they have five children.\nAround the time of Stewart's arrival in Canada, St. Matthew's delegates, along with delegates from eight other churches in the Anglican Diocese of New Westminster, walked out of the diocesan synod and asked for alternative episcopal oversight in objection to the synod's approval of same-sex blessings. After the synod, a group of clergy dissenting from the synod's decision sought alternative episcopal oversight. After efforts to establish alternative oversight failed, in May 2008, Stewart and other clergy relinquished their orders in the Anglican Church of Canada, and St. Matthew's sought oversight from the Southern Cone and joined the newly formed ANiC. The church was involved in litigation over the ownership of its property; the Supreme Court of British Columbia (a trial court jurisdiction) in 2009 affirmed that the property belonged to the Diocese of New Westminster. The higher B.C. Court of Appeal affirmed the ruling, and the Supreme Court of Canada declined to hear the case, resulting in St. Matthew's leaving its prior building.\nAfter Trevor Walters was elected to serve as ANiC suffragan bishop for western Canada, Stewart succeeded him as rector of St. Matthew's. Stewart also served as archdeacon for the Fraser Valley area. In 2021, Stewart was one of two finalists in the election for ANiC diocesan bishop; Dan Gifford was elected. Stewart was elected bishop suffragan in ANiC's 2023 election, and he was consecrated by Foley Beach in Abbotsford on March 23, 2024.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nStewart, Mike (2007).

        "content": "The Statesmen, or Statesmen Clan (Lithuanian: \"valstybininkai\", \"valstybininkų\" klanas, generally written with quote marks) is a conspiracy theory which claims that a deep state of unelected officials, based in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the State Security Department of Lithuania (VSD), seeks to influence the actions of elected officials, protect each other in power and take control of Lithuania. The conspiracy theory emerged in 2006, after the death of VSD officer Vytautas Pociūnas in Belarus, who the theory claims was a whistleblower of the clan's activities. The conspiracy theory was promoted by politicians in the Homeland Union (TS-LKD).\nThough primarily connected with investigations from 2006 to 2010, the theory has experienced a revival since 2019, after opponents of the Homeland Union claimed that the \"clan\" remains active and is pressuring the Šimonytė Cabinet.\n\n\n== Content ==\n\nAccording to Valdas Vasiliauskas, editor-in-chief of Lietuvos žinios (later a Member of the Seimas for the Way of Courage party), the Statesmen are \"a clan-like group of persons connected by constant mutual relations, distribution of roles and tasks among group members\", it is a highly organized and hierarchical organization (Vasiliauskas identified Albinas Januška as its leader), has control of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the State Security Department, the President of Lithuania, the military, police, the political sciences faculty of Vilnius University and is connected with the courts, political parties and the media.\nPociūnas was generally described as a whistleblower, a VSD official who was aware of the conspiracy and was killed for attempting to reveal it to the media. The specific information differed. In 2008, Vasiliauskas claimed that Pociūnas investigated the connections between the \"Statesmen\" and the energy company Dujotekana, as well as the company's influence in government institutions. Later, in 2014, he claimed that Pociūnas was aware about the CIA black site in Antaviliai, near Vilnius, and the alleged bribes to VSD officials which allowed its creation.\nIt had been alleged that the \"Statesmen\" were responsible for the fall of Brazauskas Cabinet II and convinced members of the Labour Party to support the formation of the Kirkilas Cabinet. Viktor Uspaskich accused \"statesmen\" of attempting to destroy his political career and his party via Labour's \"dark accounting\" case. Rolandas Paksas, President of Lithuania impeached in 2004, claimed that he opposed the \"statesmen\" during his presidency and was removed for refusing to allow the establishment of the Antaviliai CIA black site. In 2007, he claimed that \"statesmen\" conspired to raise attention towards LGBT rights in Lithuania to distract attention from their case.\nAccording to Rasa Juknevičienė, Member of the Seimas from the Homeland Union, the deep state emerged after the 1998 Russian financial crisis and the 2000 Lithuanian parliamentary election, which spurned a group of individuals to \"take the reins of the state to their hands\" with Russian financial support. Vasiliauskas claimed that the conspiracy formed as early as 1990, within the deputies of the Supreme Council of Lithuania, also known as the Reconstituent Seimas, including members of the former Communist Party of Lithuania. Antanas Valionis claimed that \"TS-LKD campaign against the so-called Statesmen\" could have been motivated by the struggles of business groups in the energy sector in 2000–2006 and VSD investigations into previous unexplained violent acts, such as the Bražuolė bridge bombing in 1994 and the bombing of the editorial office of Lietuvos rytas in 1995. According to the politician, the TS-LKD interpreted this as a conspiracy against them.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Death of Vytautas Pociūnas ===\nThough the pejorative term \"valstybininkas\" (\"Statesman\", meaning an official who belongs to a group of influential figures seeking personal gain) has been used in Lithuanian media since at least 2005, the conspiracy theory emerged after Vytautas Pociūnas, a VSD officer stationed in Brest, Belarus, was found dead after falling out of the window of Hotel Intourist on 23 August 2006. The death was ruled an accident, but it was rumoured that Pociūnas was killed for his alleged investigations into a deep state within the Lithuanian government and institutions, and their anti-state activities. It became more prominent after an investigation into Pociūnas' death by the State Prosecutor's Office was closed in late 2006 after a very quick investigation (including a claim that Pociūnas fell out of a window while urinating, which was interpreted as a smear campaign), and after an Ekstra magazine interview of VSD deputy director Darius Jurgelevičius in September 2006, in which he commented on the public interest in the Pociūnas case:\n\nThere are many nuances and details. And if all this rummaging around in those bones continues, moments that will not add honor to the whole thing will start to emerge. I think someone is trying to make a big show, but the result, I believe, will be disappointing. Unfortunate.\nNumerous protests were held in support of Pociūnas and his surviving family, and the final annual commemoration of his death was held in 2016. The death was also followed by an investigation by the Seimas National Security and Defense Committee (Lithuanian: Lietuvos Respublikos Seimo nacionalinio saugumo ir gynybos komitetas, NSGK) into VSD activity, initiated by Homeland Union Member of the Seimas Rasa Juknevičienė.\n\n\n=== 2006 Seimas investigation ===\nOn 4 December 2006, NSGK published their conclusion on the activities of the State Security Department. 33 active (in December 2006) and 4 former VSD officials, Seimas members Andrius Kubilius, Jurgis Razma, Antanas Valionis, former secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Albinas Januška, former Director General of VSD, ambassador to Spain Mečys Laurinkus, consul general in Grodno Daiva Mockuvienė, television journalist Joana Lapėnienė, Vytautas Pociūnas's wife Liudvika Pociūnienė and brother Algimantas Pociūnas, and signatory of the Act of March 11 Algirdas Endriukaitis testified before the committee.\nThe investigation was controversial. Januška resigned from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, claiming that he is unable to answer public criticism while keeping state secrets, but was immediately reappointed as advisor to Gediminas Kirkilas. NSGK members unsuccessfully demanded certificates from the VSD related to possible corrupt connections of high-ranking officials. Refused, the politicians turned to President Valdas Adamkus hoping to convince him to temporarily suspend the then head of the VSD, Arvydas Pocius, whose decision not to provide information was assessed as a mockery of the Seimas. However, the president refused to meet with members of the Seimas. During the investigation, independent journalists published information regarding the suspects' alleged membership in the KGB and connections with the Russian state energy company Gazprom.\nIn the committee's opinion, Pociūnas was removed from his previous duties within the VSD and assigned to Belarus in order to stop corruption investigations he was conducting in the transport and energy sectors. In addition, the committee stated that\n\ncertain signs identified during the parliamentary investigation allow to assume that some VSD investigations, actions of directors and officials in some cases may have been carried out or their results used for the benefit of certain political groups, in other cases - to influence these political groups or politicians themselves.\nThe committee's opinion statement first coined the term \"statesman\" to refer to individuals allegedly involved, to Albinas Januška, without a negative connotation.\nThe term \"statesmen\" was originally claimed by the accused politicians and civil servants themselves, to express their patriotism. Mečys Laurinkus commented on the existence of a group which \"formulated tasks\" for the State Security Department on 30 October 2007:\n\nIn many democratic states, there is a mechanism for forming tasks for the intelligence service and even reviewing them annually. These are special groups of politicians in the government or presidency. There is no such mechanism in Lithuania, the VSD works according to the Law on the Fundamentals of National Security, like a radar signaling an impending threat.\nIt is effective, but very expensive, and it also duplicates the work of other services. Several influential Lithuanian politicians, who are quite rightly called by the honorable name of \"statesmen\", took the initiative of formulating tasks. Unusual, new, but very necessary work has received distorted evaluations from both inside and outside the institution.\nThis was taken by various politicians in the country to be a confirmation of the existence of the conspiracy, and Member of the Seimas Algimantas Matulevičius (Civic Democracy Party), in charge of a parliamentary investigation into VSD activity, described it as an unconstitutional act. Laurinkus later claimed that he does not remember the existence of such a scandal.\n\n\n=== Renewed criminal investigation ===\nVytautas Pociūnas' widow, Liudvika Pociūnienė, requested the reopening of the terminated investigation in November 2006, claiming that it lacked detail and was not impartial. She was joined by Member of the Seimas Saulius Pečeliūnas (TS-LKD), who formed a nonpartisan civil society organization, Rally of Citizens (Lithuanian: Piliečių santalka), claiming to combat perceived cliques in the government and a \"nomenklatura more powerful than the law\". Both complaints were dismissed by the General Prosecutor's Office in July 2007 on lacking grounds.\nPociūnienė received support throughout the political spectrum. Vytautas Landsbergis, former leader of the Homeland Union, asserted that the conclusions of the prosecutor's office that Pociūnas died in an accident were \"worthless\", and the New Union (Social Liberals) lodged a demand that the General Prosecutor's Office should make the materials of the investigation file public. On 17 August 2007, Prime Minister Gediminas Kirkilas announced the formation of a special work committee which would investigate the circumstances of Pociūnas' death, led by publicist Vytautas Ališauskas and staffed by Seimas and European Parliament members from several political parties. New forensic and medical experts were hired after Pociūnas' widow and the press criticized the negligence of the forensic experts during the initial investigation.\nThe renewed investigation was slow and controversial. It was criticized by President Valdas Adamkus as a threat to the independence of the prosecution system. The committee could only meet in 2008 due to conflicting schedules of the committee members (including two EP members, who worked in Brussels and could only participate on Fridays), and several of the committee's members resigned before the first meeting due to this inactivity. Meanwhile, at the order of court, the General Prosecutor's Office renewed investigation into the case, which doubled the work of the committee. It was shut down in March 2008. An independent investigation commission was organized by Sąjūdis in July 2008.\nOn 24 February 2009, the case was closed again and the General Prosecutor's Office reaffirmed that Pociūnas' death was an accident. Liudvika Pociūnienė once again protested the verdict. On 9 June 2009, the Vilnius District Court ordered the prosecutors to reopen the case a third time. Under court order, the case was also reclassified as a murder case. After investigations into official documents, over 100 witnesses questioned and experiments organized in the Inturist hotel in Brest, the case was closed as an accident again on 1 February 2013. Pociūnienė requested the case to be reopened again, but her request was dismissed.\n\n\n=== 2008 \"List of the Statesmen\" publication ===\nOn 26 March 2008, an article titled \"Lithuania Has Been Taken Over by the Statesmen Clan?\" (Lithuanian: \"Lietuvą užvaldė „valstybininkų\" klanas?\") was published on the newspaper Lietuvos žinios. This article compiled a list of 43 civil servants, diplomats, advisors of then-president Valdas Adamkus, VSD employees, businessmen, political scientists, and members of the Seimas, who were allegedly members of a single hierarchical structured \"clan\" which seeks to take over the state. According to editor-in-chief Valdas Vasiliauskas, it was published under a pseudonym to \"protect the author from possible retaliation\".\nIn the same month, Mečys Laurinkus published an open letter for Vytautas Landsbergis, requesting him to use his authority to end \"the idiotic persecution of some civil servants that has been going on for almost two years now\". Laurinkus also asked the leadership of TS-LKD to mention a single crime committed by the alleged \"statesmen\".\nAn investigation into the circumstances surrounding the formation of the Kirkilas Cabinet was proposed in the Seimas in 2008, but was voted down. Discussion of the \"List of Statesmen\" and the high point of the conspiracy theory coincided with the 2008 Lithuanian parliamentary election, which was seen as an opportunity for \"De-Albinization\". Several parties vowed to destroy the conspiracy's perceived power in their electoral campaigns. Opponents of the perceived \"statesmen\" described themselves as \"patriots\" (Lithuanian: \"pilietininkai\"). Both sides alleged that the other side was influenced or controlled by corporations and foreign interests - \"statesmen\" referred to the holding company MG Baltic and chemical company Achema, while \"patriots\" referred to Dujotekana and the business alliance \"VP Ten\", led by Nerijus Numavičius. Both sides accused the other of collusion with Russia.\nThe election was won by the Homeland Union, which was joined by the Liberal and Centre Union, the National Resurrection Party and the Liberal Movement in a centre-right \"Coalition for Change\" (Lithuanian: Permainų koalicija), which formed the Kubilius Cabinet II.\n\n\n=== \"Hawks\" counter-conspiracy ===\nIn November 2008, VSD director Povilas Malakauskas informed the newly appointed Homeland Union prime minister Andrius Kubilius of the existence of an alleged anti-state group called \"Hawks\" (Lithuanian: \"vanagai\"). \"Hawks\" were journalists and politicians affiliated with the political right who were actively involved in the alleged \"unmasking\" of \"statesmen\" activity. Valdas Vasiliauskas, journalist Tomas Čyvas, Darius Kuolys (later founder of the Lithuanian List), Audrius Bačiulis, Virgis Valentinavičius (advisor of Andrius Kubilius), Vladas Laučius (chief editor of news portal Alfa.lt, previously consultant for MG Baltic Media) and others were alleged as members of this counter-conspiracy. Alleged members of this group claimed that this was a VSD attempt to control the media and influence politicians.\nEdvardas Čiuldė claimed that \"hawks\" represented the interests of large media companies and were financed by the alcohol producer Stumbras, owned by MG Baltic.\n\n\n=== Election of Dalia Grybauskaitė ===\nDalia Grybauskaitė, President of Lithuania from 2009 to 2019, won the 2009 Lithuanian presidential election with an anti-systemic platform and was supported by the Homeland Union. After her inauguration, several state officials implicated in the conspiracy theory were removed from office. In August 2009, in a controversial decree, she fired deputy director of the VSD Darius Jurgelevičius, while Mečys Laurinkus was accused of politicking in diplomatic service and recalled from the Lithuanian embassy in Georgia in late 2009. Valdas Vasiliauskas described it as \"a war between the President and the Statesmen\".\nAlbinas Januška retired from politics in late 2008 to herd sheep in a farm near Zarasai, but continued to unofficially advise politicians on state affairs.\nBy late 2010, the Homeland Union dropped their interest in the \"statesmen\" conspiracy theory and ceased investigations in government institutions such as the VSD, although it was still maintained by independent \"hawk\" journalists, the Civic Democracy Party and the Way of Courage party.\nAccording to declassified VSD information, officials allegedly a part of the \"Statesmen\" group (including Albinas Januška and Raimondas Lopata) attempted to appoint Mindaugas Bastys as Minister of Agriculture in the Butkevičius Cabinet in 2012.\n\n\n=== Revival ===\nIn early 2023, the conspiracy theory was revived after the publication of the book \"The Whistleblower and the President\" (Lithuanian: Pranešėjas ir prezidentas) by Dovydas Pancerovas and Birutė Davidonytė, which described alleged business and VSD involvement in the Gitanas Nausėda campaign during the 2019 Lithuanian presidential election, including illegal collection of personal information. After the publication of the book, MPs of the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union alleged that the book was published to discredit the incumbent president and proposed an investigation into \"statesmen\" activity, but the proposal did not find support even among the opposition.\nIn January 2024, Gitanas Nausėda's chief advisor Frederikas Jansonas claimed that appointments to vacant ambassador positions are delayed due to \"statesmen\" sabotage, and alleged that the conspiracy group is allied with the Šimonytė Cabinet. He identified members of the government, such as Žygimantas Pavilionis, as individuals listed in the 2008 \"List of the Statesmen\". Albinas Januška dismissed the allegations.\n\n\n== Alleged members ==\nProponents of the conspiracy theory generally refer to individuals named in the \"List of the Statesmen\" (Lithuanian: \"valstybininkų\" sąrašas), which lists the alleged deep state's members and supporters. The list was originally published by the newspaper Lietuvos žinios on 26 March 2008:\n\nAlbinas Januška, advisor to Gediminas Kirkilas (Prime Minister of Lithuania from 2006 to 2008), generally alleged to be the leader of the conspiracy;\nMečys Laurinkus, director of the VSD from 1998 to 2004;\nOfficials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs:\nLaimonas Tallat-Kelpša, ministry secretary;\nŽygimantas Pavilionis, ministry secretary;\nVioleta Gaižauskatė, ministry official;\nRimantas Šidlauskas, ambassador to Russia;\nViktoras Baublys, consul general to Kaliningrad;\nEdminas Bagdonas, ambassador to Belarus;\nAlgirdas Kumža, ambassador to Ukraine;\nEgidijus Meilūnas, ambassador to Poland;\nJuozas Bernatonis, ambassador to Estonia, former vice-chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania;\nAdvisors to Valdas Adamkus, President of Lithuania from 1998 to 2003 and from 2004 to 2009:\nValteris Baliukonis, advisor to the President on foreign policy;\nSimonas Šatūnas, advisor to the President on foreign policy;\nLauras Bielinis, advisor to the President on internal policy;\nMindaugas Ladiga, advisor to the President, former VSD officer;\nAušra Rauličkytė, advisor to the President on legal matters;\nMembers of the Institute of International Relations and Political Sciences of Vilnius University, alleged by conspiracy theorists to be a \"Statesmen factory\":\nRaimundas Lopata, director of the institute from 1999 to 2009;\nAudrius Siaurusevičius, journalist, lecturer;\nEgidijus Kūris, justice in the Constitutional Court of Lithuania and its president from 2002 to 2008;\nPovilas Makalauskas, director of the Special Investigation Service from 2004 to 2007;\nValdas Tutkus, commander of the Lithuanian Armed Forces from 2004 to 2009;\nAlgis Vaičeliūnas, general, candidate to director of the VSD in 2007, deputy of Albinas Januška on national defense;\nKęstutis Lančinskas, deputy general commissioner of the Lithuanian Police Force;\nGediminas Kirkilas, leader of the Social Democratic Party and Prime Minister from 2006 to 2008;\nJustinas Karosas, member of the Social Democratic Party, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Seimas;\nAntanas Valionis, member of the Seimas from the New Union (Social Liberals), Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2000 to 2006;\nThe newspaper also claimed that other, unmentioned figures are affiliated with the conspiracy within political parties, in the legal system and in business.\n\n\n== Impact ==\n\n\n=== Political impact ===\nThe Statesmen conspiracy theory was pronounced during the 2008 Lithuanian parliamentary election. In their 2008 election programs, the Civic Democracy Party vowed to \"destroy the \"statesmen clan\"\", and Order and Justice claimed that they \"seek power in order to restore the state to the people, which they were robbed by the \"statesmen\" clan\". The conspiracy was also frequently referred to by politicians of the Homeland Union, such as Rasa Juknevičienė, as well as President Dalia Grybauskaitė, who connected it with Russian influence in the Lithuanian government.\nDuring Kubilius Cabinet II, the death of Vytautas Pociūnas was brought up by Conservative politicians, such as Jurgis Razma, as waving the bloody shirt to support reforms to the State Security Department and the dissolution of the national energy company LEO LT.\nThe Statesmen conspiracy theory emerged at a similar time as the Case of Drąsius Kedys, another controversial legal case which led to public protest against perceived corruption and \"clans\" in the state apparatus. According to controversial journalist and TV presenter Rūta Janutienė, in both cases, \"the victim is turned into the culprit of the accident, labels of alcoholics and drug addicts are attached to the deceased\". Tomas Čyvas claimed that state security services connected to the conspiracy were responsible for separating Drąsius Kedys and his daughter. Similarly, the investigation into the unexplained assassination of VSD officer Juras Abromavičius took place in 2007, and some journalists and conspiracy theorists stated that they were committed by the same \"mafia clan\".\nVytautas Pociūnas' widow, Liudvika Pociūnienė, became a member of TS-LKD and was elected as a Member of the Seimas in the 2020 Lithuanian parliamentary election.\n\n\n=== Foreign assessment ===\nA 2006 November file on the resignation of Albinas Januška by the United States embassy in Lithuania was leaked from a document cache by WikiLeaks. In it, US officials express their surprise at Januška's resignation, mention his influence in the Kirkilas Cabinet and state theories about his resignation by questioned Lithuanian officials, including possible Russian involvement. According to the document,\n\nWhenever a prominent official in Lithuania becomes the victim of a scandal, it is usual to blame Russia. We may never know why this mysterious official resigned. What still confuses us is that A. Januska resigned because of such hard-to-prove and unfounded accusations. For all we know, he could have overcome this situation if he had wanted to. However, we believe that this Svengali of Lithuania will remain active and influential in the circles of Lithuanian domestic and foreign politics in the future.\n\n\n=== In popular culture ===\nA previously unnamed street in the Pilaitė district in Vilnius was named Vytautas Pociūnas Street in 2016.\nThe conspiracy theory was parodied on the Lithuanian political satire TV show Dviračio žinios.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAntaviliai\nBražuolė bridge bombing\nCoup of the Volunteers\nlt:Juras Abromavičius\nVytautas Pociūnas\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Eidsfoss Church (Norwegian: Eidsfoss kirke) is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Holmestrand Municipality in Vestfold county, Norway. It is located in the village of Eidsfoss. It is one of the churches for the \"Hof, Vassås og Eidsfoss\" parish which is part of the Nord-Jarlsberg prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Tunsberg. The white, wooden church was built in a long church design in 1904 using plans drawn up by the architect Holger Sinding-Larsen. The church seats about 200 people.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Eidsfoss ironworks company decided to build a church in the village of Eidsfoss at the turn of the 20th century. The church paid for most of the cost of the building and it was on donated land. Holger Sinding-Larsen designed the church and Andreas A. Kolstad was hired as the lead builder for the project. Construction began in 1903, but unfortunately on 30 November 1903, the unfinished church building caught fire and burned down. After the rubble was cleared, the church was rebuilt on the same site. The new church was completed and consecrated on 20 July 1904 by the Bishop Anton Christian Bang. The timber-framed church is often referred to as a cruciform church, and from the outside it may look like one. However, the pews are arranged as in a long church. The cross arms are actually sacristies with galleries above, rather that part of the main nave, so it is more like a long church than a cruciform church. In 1958, the ironworks company sold gave the church to the parish.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of churches in Tunsberg\n\n\n== References ==",

The house is notable for its interior quadratura and trompe-l'œil decorations by Ferdinando Galli-Bibbiena. Near the villa a small former oratory (Oratorio della Madonna di Loreto) was erected in 1709. The grounds also have fanciful decorative architecture, such as a Baroque-style triumphal arch (Arco del Bargello) and a Triton fountain.

It offers institutional and retail brokerage, currency and commodity trading, mutual funds and bonds. \nFounded in 2010, the company is headquartered in Bengaluru and has a physical presence in many major Indian cities.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe company was founded in August 2010 by two brothers Nithin and Nikhil Kamath. The company's name Zerodha, indicates a combination of words for the company's ideals: Zero and \"Rodha\", the Sanskrit word for \"barrier\".\nAs of 2019, Zerodha was the largest retail stock broker in India by active client base and contributes up to 2% of daily retail volumes on Indian stock exchanges.\nZerodha is also an investor in Kofluence, an AI-driven adtech influencer marketing platform. The company had raised pre-series funding of $4 million as of February 8, 2022\nIn June 2020, Zerodha entered the \"unicorn club\" with a self-valuation of around $1 billion. This valuation was based on the ESOP buyback exercise that the company undertook by valuing each share at more than four times the book value of ₹700 per share.\nIn March 2024, Zerodha reached its fund house to ₹1,000 Crore AUM.\n\n\n== Society ==\nA fixed commission of up to ₹20 is applied to a transaction, regardless of its size, and offers its retail clients a host of purpose-built trading applications.\nZerodha has a base of more than 12 lakh (1.2 million) of active customers.

By keeping the ticket size under $1 million per investment, the fund focused on reducing risk but focused on financing start-ups in new technology and new product development. Some notable investments by Rainmatter are in startups such as Cred, Finception, Smallcase, and Sensibull.\n\n\n=== True Beacon and AMC Mutual Fund ===\nIn 2019, Zerodha started True Beacon, the Alternative Investment Fund focused on providing returns in volatile markets through their defensive investment strategy. The $2 million minimum investment fund was able to generate a return of more than 13% in its first year. In 2020, Zerodha applied for a license to set up an AMC mutual fund in India.\n\n\n== Technical problems and interruptions ==\nThere have been multiple reports of technical issues including glitches, system outages and connectivity issues on Zerodha's Kite platform, especially on days with high market volatility and F&O expiry days.\nIn November 2020, Livemint reported that some Zerodha traders complained of being unable to access its Kite platform due to a technical issue. Several users took to Twitter to report a login issue. Zerodha, in an official statement, admitted the problem.\n\n\n== See also ==\nShare\nBroker\nEToro\nHome banking\nStock broker\nStock market\nRobinhood (azienda)\nSpeculation\n\n\n== References ==\n\n Media related to Zerodha at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Juliana Daudt Brizola (born 3 August 1975) is a Brazilian lawyer and politician. She was a councilwoman in the city of Porto Alegre from 2009 to 2011 and later became a state deputy in the state of Rio Grande do Sul from 2011 to 2023. She is currently affiliated with the Democratic Labour Party (PDT), which she has been affiliated with since she was 18 years old. She is the granddaughter of Leonel Brizola, as well as the sister of fellow politicians Brizola Neto and Leonel Brizola Neto, being the twin sister of the latter.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in Porto Alegre in 1975, Brizola moved to Uruguay at 3 years old as her grandfather Leonel went into exile during the military dictatorship. On her mothers side, she is the granddaughter of aeronautic captain Alfredo Daudt, who was one of the service members who stopped the take-off of FAB jets that were sent to bomb Piratini Palace during the Legality Campaign.\nIn 1982, she moved to Rio de Janeiro as Leonel became the governor of the state. Brizola graduated with a law degree from Universidade Santa Úrsula in Rio de Janeiro. After she finished her studies, she returned to Porto Alegre, where she took specialization courses and later mastered in criminal law at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul.\nIn 2008, she became a councilwoman in Porto Alegre as part of the PDT. She was the most voted for candidate from the PDT.\nBrizola was elected a state deputy in Rio Grande do Sul in 2010, being elected with 61,305 votes, becoming once again the most voted candidate from her party. During her campaign, she emphasized her plan for governance where she emphasized education, following the policies of her grandfather. During her first term, she passed a law in the state assembly that created a constitutional amendment changing the Escola de Tempo Integral project into a state project.\nDuring the 2014 elections, she became a first substitute of the PDT; However, with the mandate of Diogenes Basegio being revoked by the regional election courts, Brizola became a state deputy once again. She was reelected in 2018 with ~43,000 votes, with the largest percentage of her vote share coming from her grandfather's home city of Carazinho. She later would become the leader of the PDT in the state legislative assembly.\nIn 2020, she ran to be the mayor of Porto Alegre with a PDT-led coalition. She came in 4th place with 41,407 votes, thus not advancing to the second round. In 2022, she was elected as a first substitute for federal deputy.\n\n\n== Electoral history ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJuliana Brizola on Twitter",

        "content": "Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus, is a 1991 made-for-television Christmas family drama film directed by Charles Jarrott. The film is based on the story behind the widely reprinted editorial by Francis Pharcellus Church written in response to a letter by eight-year-old Virginia O'Hanlon asking whether Santa Claus was real in 1897. It stars Charles Bronson, Katharine Isabelle, Richard Thomas, and Ed Asner. Produced by Andrew J. Fenady, it premiered on ABC on December 1, 1991.\nThe script was initially taking a direction that was more oriented for children's Saturday morning show before taking a dramatic approach. Action film actor Charles Bronson loved the script and accepted to act against type. Also acting against type is Richard Thomas known for playing sensible characters plays a tough Irish immigrant. \n\n\n== Production ==\nProducer Andrew J. Fenady explained that the project was unusual for him since he is known for tougher projects. On developing the script he said \"I added a lot of the newspaper stuff. The script originally was more like a Saturday children's show\".\nOn the casting of Charles Bronson, he said \"we sent it to him and he loved it, I think he really related to it. It was so against type\". At the time, Bronson had recently lost his wife of 20 years and since in the film, Bronson's character also lost his wife he was asked about it and denied any parallels.\nRichard Thomas known for playing sensible character, had to adapt in order to play an Irish immigrant. Fenady explained that \"we got someone to teach him the manly art of self-defense. He did a lot of the stunts himself\".\nOn casting Katharine Isabelle for the role of Virginia O'Hanlon, Fenady said \"we lined up every 8-year-old in Los Angeles. We had a casting director up in Vancouver where we shot and he asked us to look at a tape. When we saw it we knew we had found Virginia.\nOn shooting a Christmas movie Vancouver during the summer, Fenady said \"we shot in June and July when it was 99 degrees. We had to use $40,000 worth of ice and we literally snowed in Stanley Park and the other places we shot\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\nLinda Renaud of The Hollywood Reporter thought the film was excellent. She said Bronson \"cast totally against type, is thoroughly convincing as the distraught newspaperman\". Her final consensus was \"the dialogue throughout is fresh, comic and memorable. For a telefilm, the production values are exceptional. Many of the exteriors in this exquisite period piece were shot in Vancouver's Gastown. Of special note is the musical score by Charles Bernstein - from ragtime to the Christmas classics it sings throughout. Turn on your VCRs Yes Virginia, There Is a Santa Claus is an instant perennial\".\nSusan Stewart in her review published in The Pittsburgh Press expressed liking the film. She highlighted Thomas performance as impressive and her overall impression was that is was better than most television films.\nIn his review published in The Cincinnati Post, Mark Lorando expressed disliking the film. He thought that Asner was over acting, and Bronson was doing the opposite, while Isabelle couldn't be taken seriously. His final consensus was \"the end result is heartwarming and life-affirming and all that Christmas Jazz — but then so is reading Church’s editorial which takes much less than two hours and won’t keep the kids up late on a school night.\"\nSteve Hall of The Indianapolis Star did not like it. He said \"the TV movie is so relentlessly despondent that even its hopelessly saccharine ending can't save it from giving one the holiday blues\".\nJon Burlingame wrote in the The Times-Mail that while the concept was good the execution was poor due to being too contrived.\nMichael Hill of The Evening Sun  wrote \"it's all done with nice sets, good actors and genuine earnestness, but Yes, Virginia, There Is a Santa Claus has that you've-seen-it-before predictability that often plagues Christmas movies\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Christmas films\n\n\n== References ==",

He and his father-in-law, Andrew III, Baron of Vitré, went on crusade and following the death of his father-in-law, he inherited the barony of Vitré, the viscounty of Rennes, and the lands of Marcillé and Aubigné, through his wife Philippa de Vitré. Guy inherited Laval after his mother's death in 1264.

After his father's death and as the eldest son of Emma of Laval, he took, in accordance with her parents' matrimonial conventions, the name of Guy VII. His mother nevertheless, remained Lady of Laval throughout her life. Guy succeeded his father in an indeterminate part of his lands: an arrangement which he subsequently made in 1247 with his half-brother, Bouchard VI de Montmorency, assured him those of Acquigny in Normandy, of Hérouville, near Pontoise, of Isle Saint-Denys, of Epinolet, Andelys.\nAfter taking the name of Laval, Guy retained the arms of Montmorency, which he loaded with five silver shells on the cross. The name of Montmorency will be taken up in the 18th century by Guy André Pierre de Montmorency-Laval, Marshal of France and Anne Adrien Pierre de Montmorency-Laval, Duke of Laval.\n\n\n== Crusade ==\n\nGuy left in 1248 for the Seventh Crusade with Andrew III, Baron of Vitré, his father-in-law. He participated in the capture of Damietta in 1249.\n\n\n=== Succession of Vitré ===\nGuy's father-in-law died in 1250, leaving a son, who died the following year leaving no issue. Through this, Guy, in the name of his wife, inherited the barony of Vitré, one of the four large baronies of Brittany, the viscounty of Rennes]], attached to this house, as well as the lordships of Aubigné, Marcillé and Châtillon-en-Vendelais. Barely lord of Vitré, Guy had to fulfill a duty concerning the coronation of the bishop of Rennes, which fell to him jointly with the lords of Aubigné, Châteaugiron and de la Guerche.\n\n\n== Death ==\nGuy succeeded his mother in the land of Laval in 1264. He joined Charles I of Anjou, accompanied by his son, in the expedition into Italy, where he died. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Guy VIII of Laval.\n\n\n== Marriages and children ==\nIn 1239, Guy married Philippa de Vitré, the eldest daughter of Andrew III, Baron of Vitré and Catherine of Thouars, sister of the Duchess of Brittany. On 20 August 1253, Guy VII and his wife made the pilgrimage of Rocamadour. On 16 September 1254, his wife died of phthisis. Their children were:\n\nEmmette, married around 1275 to Prigent de Coëtmen, lord of Landegonnet, viscount of Tonquédec.\nGuy VIII of Laval, lord of Laval, Aubigné and Vitré, married firstly, Isabeau of Beaumont-sur-Oise and secondly, Jeanne of Beaumont, Lady of Loué\nCatherine (born c.1240), lady of Laudauran, married on 5 May 1265 to Harvey IV, Viscount of Léon\nGuyonne (born c.1250), married to Patri de Chourses\nThe following year, Guy married Thomass de La Guerche, lady of Mareuil, daughter of William de La Guerche, lord of Pouancé, widow of Andrew III, Baron of Vitré.

It was a catalyst for their first Championship success in the club's history and ended 24 years of dominance by the Prague and Pardubice clubs.\nThe club won a second extraliga in 2007 under the name PK Plzeň and continue to race under that name with the exception of a couple of merged years in 2012 and 2016 when they raced with Divišov and Brezolupy teams.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Euphrosyne (born no later than the end of the 12th century, died on May 23 or 25, earliest in the beginning of the 13th century) was a princess of Racibórz and Opole, and probably also of Kraków between 1210 and 1211, the daughter of Duke Mieszko IV Tanglefoot and Ludmila (most likely from the Přemyslid dynasty).\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nEuphrosyne's father was Duke Mieszko IV Tanglefoot. Presumably, between 1170 and 1180, he married Ludmila, who probably hailed from the Přemyslid dynasty. Researchers most commonly identify her as the daughter of either Otto III Detleb, the Duke of Olomouc, and Durancia, or the son of the aforementioned couple, Włodzimierz, and his (unnamed) spouse. There have also been isolated theories suggesting that Euphrosyne's mother was the daughter of the Bohemian Duke Soběslav I and the Croatian Princess Adelaide, or the child of one of Soběslav's brothers. From the marriage of Mieszko and Ludmila, most likely, five children were born: Kazimierz, Ludmiła, Agnieszka, Euphrosyne, and Ryksa.\nEuphrosyne was born no later than the end of the 12th century. She was the first representative of the Piast dynasty to bear this name. The reason for bestowing this name upon Mieszko Tanglefoot's daughter remains unclear. It is speculated that this name may have appeared in the Piast dynasty through Euphrosyne's maternal grandmother, who probably hailed from the Rurik dynasty. If that grandmother was Durancia, then Euphrosyne's name would allude to Durancia's presumed sister, Euphrosyne of Kiev (the wife of the Hungarian King Géza II). After her, the name was given to her niece, the daughter of Casimir I of Opole, the Duchess of Kujawy.\n\n\n=== Associations with the monastery in Rybnik ===\n\nThe only information about the daughters of Mieszko and Ludmila is found in Nekrolog czarnowąski. Under the dates of January 14, May 9, and May 25, the deaths of three ducal daughters are recorded: Ludmila, Agnieszka, and Euphrosyne, respectively. The source names Ludmila and Agnieszka as heiresses of the convent founded at the initiative of Duchess Ludmila between 1203 and 1207 in Rybnik near Racibórz, later transferred to Czarnowąsy. Nekrolog Czarnowąski does not list Euphrosyne as an heiress of the convent, recording only under May 25: Euphrosina ducissa Mesconis filia (Latin). It is suspected that the princess was not closely associated with the Premonstratensians and, being an adult at the time, resided away from the convent in Rybnik.\n\n\n=== Possible marriage in Germany ===\nAccording to some researchers, Euphrosyne died as a German countess. The basis for this assumption is an entry in the female necrology of the Augustinian convent in Derneburg, currently located in the municipality of Holle in Lower Saxony, placed under the date of May 23: (E)uffrosina polonika et cometissa obiit coma [?] (Latin).\nThis entry was first interpreted in relation to Euphrosyne by 19th-century German historiography. Initially, Polish historiography approached this identification skeptically. However, currently, Polish literature also identifies both Euphrosynes. Researchers point out the coincidence of names, dates of death, and the origin of both women. Probably, the princess became the wife of one of the Saxon counts. At that time, the greatest benefactors of the Derneburg monastery were the counts of Wöltingerode and Woldenberg. However, the first of these families had its own monastery in Wöltingerode, so it is assumed that Euphrosyne's husband was a count from Woldenberg.\nAccording to historians, Euphrosyne from Opole died on May 23 or 25 in an unknown year in the 13th century.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDąbrowski, Dariusz (2008).

        "content": "Roselit Bone is a multi-instrumental and vocal ensemble based in Portland, Oregon, consisting of eight members, with occasional variations in size. The band's musical style is characterized by a blend of Gothic Country, Punk Rock, Ranchera, and cinematic Western influences.\n\n\n== History ==\nEstablished in 2013, Roselit Bone initially began as a duo featuring Charlotte McCaslin and Ben Dahmes. Their collaboration was initiated when Dahmes, working as a sound engineer, crossed paths with McCaslin during one of her performances with a prior band at a local venue. Roselit Bone then expanded into a trio with the addition of Victor Franco as the bassist. Subsequently, the band's decision to incorporate a bassist led to the recruitment of additional members, including violinists, trumpeters, keyboardists, synth players, drummers, and multiple guitarists. Later, Victor shifted from bass to guitar. This expansion was driven by the evolving songwriting needs of McCaslin, requiring a more diverse range of instrumental accompaniment.\n\nThe band's name, Roselit Bone, originated when McCaslin, drew inspiration from a novel.  \"There is a Cormac McCarthy novel where he describes a woman’s skin being like roselit bone, lit from within, but pale. I won’t say what book because I like it when people find the line in the book and then tell me about it.\"\nThroughout the band's existence, they have engaged in extensive touring, predominantly within the United States. During the initial years of touring, the band traversed the country aboard a school bus.\n\n\n== Writing style ==\nMcCaslin, as the primary songwriter, ensures each piece is suitable for solo performances or duets and imbues them with a folk essence. This approach prioritizes adaptability and emphasizes the song's quality before considering arrangements or introducing it to the larger band. After introducing the song to the band, a full arrangement is typically developed, followed by extensive workshopping with various band members to ensure accuracy and cohesion in the live band setting.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCharlotte McCaslin – Lead vocals, guitar\nVictor Franco – Guitar, backing vocals, percussion\nFaith Grossnicklaus – Violin\nBrian Crace – Guitar, backing vocals\nAmelie Diaz – Trumpet, percussion, backing vocals\nJohn England-Fisher – Trumpet, piano, backing vocals, percussion\nChris Costalupes – Bass\nJoe Benassi – Drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nBlacken & Curl (2014)\nBlister Steel (2017)\nCrisis Actor (2019)\nOffrenda (2023)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Dreamless Sleep\" (2017)\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\n\"Live at Ella Street Social Club\" (2017 cassette)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Indian physical culture is the form of physical culture practiced in India.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient era ===\n\nPhysical fitness was prized in traditional Hindu thought, with cultivation of the body (dehvada) seen as one path to full self-realization. Buddhist universities such as Nalanda taught various forms of physical culture, such as swimming and archery, with Buddha himself having been well-acquainted with martial activities prior to his enlightenment. Gurukulas focused significantly on physical education alongside academics, with Hindu epics such as the Ramayana often depicting kings marrying off their daughters to men who excelled in athletic events.\nA variety of ball games and war-training activities were present in ancient India, with both men and women participating. The traditional Indian physical culture generally used little to no equipment. Ayurvedic medical treatises such as the Charaka Samhita and the Sushruta Samhita emphasized exercise as a way of avoiding conditions such as diabetes, and prescribed exercise in accordance with the seasons. Some specialist communities were known for their acrobatic performances, such as dancing on bamboo.\nHunting for recreation was common through Indian history, and was partaken in by royals; it was done for a variety of reasons, such as proving manliness, for religious purposes, or simply for thrill-seeking purposes. The emphasis on hunting coincided with an overall view of the forest as being an area to be conquered and used by the state, which resulted in conflict between kingdoms and forest-dwellers. Though Hindu scriptures warned against excessive hunting of animals, by the end of the colonial era, some animal species had been hunted to extinction, such as cheetahs. Other exercises done with animals included provoking intoxicated elephants for the purpose of building strength by maneuvering around them and escaping their wrath.\n\n\n=== Medieval era ===\nWrestling was common in Mughal India, with even the loser of a wrestling bout being awarded some money in order to avoid discouragement. Pehlwani emerged as a fusion of Persian and native Indian wrestling traditions during this time. \n\n\n=== Colonial era ===\n\nDuring the colonial era, Indians felt emasculated by the British,  who had disarmed and demilitarized Indian society throughout the 19th century. The poverty and starvation of the era reduced Indians' ability to participate in physical exercise. Bengalis became particularly involved in seeking to combat British stereotypes of effeteness by pursuing physical culture and martial arts, with organizations such as the Hindu Mela contributing.\nInfluences from Western physical culture became prevalent in India, as mediated through influences from groups such as the YMCA, as Indians sought to benefit from the scientific nature and European nationalistic vigor present in Western schools of thought surrounding physical culture at the time. The British sought to impose their standards of physical discipline onto Indians, while discouraging traditional Indian games and negatively depicting Indian physiques. The British also used hunting as a way to establish imperial dominance and protect Indians from attacks by wild animals.\nIndians used victory in sport as a method of proving themselves against the colonizer. Indians also sought to standardize and revitalize their native physical culture during this time period, with institutions such as the akharas and vyayamshalas playing a role.\n\n\n=== Post-colonial era ===\n\nCricket, a British sport introduced into India during the colonial era, has emerged as a major aspect of modern-day India, with success in World Cups and the emergence of the Indian Premier League influencing society.\n\n\n== Relationship with various movements ==\n\n\n=== Hindu nationalism ===\n\nThe Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has encouraged loyalty to India as a Hindu country in its followers through the practice of traditional Indian physical culture.\n\n\n=== Militancy ===\n\nIn the colonial era, gyms and other physical culture institutions helped freedom fighters build their strength towards anti-colonial resistance. In the modern era, some communal violence has been linked to Hindu movements that use physical culture to become more organized and strong.\n\n\n== Influence on the world ==\n\nYoga and Indian clubs are among the most globally widespread elements of physical culture originating from India.\n\n\n== Combat sports ==\n\n\n=== Archery ===\n\n\n=== Wrestling ===\n\n\n== Physical exercises ==\n\n\n=== Dand ===\n\n\n=== Baithak ===\nA baithak, also known as a Hindu squat or a deep knee bend on toes, is performed without additional weight and body weight placed on the forefeet and toes with the heels raised throughout; during the movement, the knees track far past the toes. The baithak was a staple exercise of ancient Indian wrestlers. It was also used by Bruce Lee in his training regime. It may also be performed with the hands resting on an upturned club or the back of a chair.\n\n\n=== Yoga ===\n\n\n== Exercise equipment ==\n\n\n=== Gada ===\n\n\n=== Indian club ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nWhite, David Gordon (2011). \"Yoga, Brief History of an Idea\" (PDF).

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The Battle of Kaliabor, also known as Battle of Kaliabar, marked a pivotal naval military confrontation between the Mughal Empire, under the command of its general Mir Jumla II, and the Ahom dynasty, led by Bargohain, on March 3, 1662, near the location known as Kaliabor, situated in modern-day Assam. \nDuring the Mughal war of succession, the Ahoms seized the opportunity to invade the Mughal territory of Kamrup. After Aurangzeb ascended to the Mughal throne, he appointed one of his generals, Mir Jumla II who had aided him in the war as the Governor of Bengal. Subsequently, he dispatched this general to launch a campaign against the Ahom dynasty of Assam in order to reclaim lost territories. As the Mughal forces advanced towards the Ahom capital, they encountered an attack from the Ahoms near Kaliabar, where the Ahoms were numerically superior to the Mughals. Despite the numerical disadvantage, the Mughals emerged victorious, capturing a significant number of Ahoms as prisoners of war.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nIn the northeast of the Mughal Empire, Bengal's expanding export economy and the presence of Muslim settlers created a potential area for aggressive military campaigns. The Mughal control remained relatively weak in this region. When Shah Shuja's governorship of Bengal was disrupted by the succession war due to the death of Shah Jahan, local landlords like Prem Narayan, the ruler of Kuch Bihar, rebelled. Concurrently, Jayadhwaj Sinha, the Ahom king, dispatched an army to invade and annex Kamrup, the Mughal border district along the Brahmaputra River.\n\nAfter being defeated by Aurangzeb, Shah Shuja sought refuge in Arakan. In acknowledgment of Mir Jumla's commendable service over the past sixteen months despite facing numerous challenges, Aurangzeb decided to appoint him as the permanent Governor of Bengal. In mid-1660, Aurangzeb, determined to re-establish control over the northeast region, appointed Muhammad Said Mir Jumla, his ally from the Deccan, as the governor of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa. During his initial year in office, Mir Jumla overhauled the provincial administration, revived revenue collection, and effectively enforced Mughal authority across all three regions. He relocated the provincial capital from Rajmahal to Dhaka, aligning with the eastward shift in Bengal's population and economy. Additionally, he made significant investments in various trading ventures, collaborating with both his own agents and European trading companies. \nInitially, Mir Jumla annexed Kuch Bihar to the Mughal Empire, demonstrating both vigor and conciliation in his administration. He ordered the call to prayer, known as azan, to be recited from the royal palace terrace. War materials captured were confiscated for the imperial government and sent to Dhaka. Some goods belonging to the King of Koch Bihar were reviewed by Muhammad Abid, the escheat officer. The name Kuch Bihar was changed to Alamgirnagar. Until the appointment of Askar Khan as the permanent faujdar by the Emperor, upon the General's recommendation, Isfandiyar Beg (now titled Khan), son of Allah Yar Khan, served as the acting faujdar of the region. He was supported by Qazi Samui Shujai as diwan and Mir Abdur Razzaq and Khwajah Kish or Das Mansabdar as amirs. \nSimilar to the Bhuiyas of Bengal, the Maghs, and the Feringhis, the Ahoms posed a significant threat to the security of the Mughals in Bengal, particularly along the northeastern frontier. By November 1661, Mir Jumla was ready to embark on a campaign described as \"a holy war with the infidels of Assam,\" as reported by his official news correspondent.\n\n\n== Preparations and initial conflicts ==\n\n\n=== The Ahom forces ===\nThe exact number of war-boats possessed by the Ahoms remains uncertain. The historian Fathiya suggests a remarkably high figure exceeding 32,000. Whereas Talish mentions estimates derived from reports of the \"Waqiahnavis\" of Gauhati, indicating that by 1662, no fewer than 32,000 boats had arrived. Considering those engaged for the army and those belonging to the Assamese, it is plausible that more than half belonged to the Assamese. It's reasonable to estimate that the Ahoms deployed around 1000 war-boats against Mir Jumla, outnumbering his naval strength by more than threefold. However, little is known about the naval organization of the Ahoms and the personnel of such a large flotilla. Only a few Ahom officers' names are recorded, such as the Naubaicha, who oversaw 1000 men for manning royal boats, and the Nausalia Phukan, tasked with one thousand carpenters for boat construction and repair.\n\nAccording to Wade, the Ahom mariners lacked proficiency compared to the Mughals when navigating the open sea. They also lacked the essential skills for artillery use. Additionally, bridges over rivers were occasionally built by workers brought in from Bengal, as the local population lacked the required expertise.\n\nThe Ahom naval soldiers mostly use bows, and arrows and matchlocks but do not come up in courage to the Muhammadan soldiers .\n\n\n=== The Mughal forces ===\nThe Mughal governor Mir Jumla gathered a formidable force consisting of 12,000 cavalry, 30,000 foot soldiers, and a flotilla comprising several hundred-armed vessels. Among these vessels were ten ghurabs, or floating batteries, each carrying fourteen guns and towed by four rowing boats. Additionally, the son of the King of Koch Bihar, recently converted to Islam, allied with the Mughals in their campaign against the Ahoms.\n\n\n=== Capturing Ahom forts ===\nThe Mughals advanced towards Gharaghat on the right bank of the Karatoya river and reached the Brahmaputra five days later. The army and fleet were instructed to march in close coordination. Dilir Khan led the vanguard, Mir Murtaza was responsible for communication, and the fleet was commanded by admiral Ibn Husain, with assistance from subordinate admirals Jamal Khan and Manawar Khan. Successively, forts of the Ahoms fell into the hands of the Mughals. Strategic posts like Jogigopa at the mouth of the Manas river (opposite Goalpara), Saraighat at the mouth of Bar Nadi, and Pandu and Kajali at the mouth of the Kallang river were evacuated by the Ahoms. Despite the strength and number parity between the Ahom and Mughal fleets, the Ahom fleet did not engage with the imperial fleet until it reached Kajali, which appears peculiar. \n\n\n== The Battle ==\nThe Mughal army reached a location called Kaliabar in the Nowgong district, where a significant naval battle took place on March 3, 1662. Due to the presence of hills along the Brahmaputra River from this point onward, the imperial army had to move away from the riverbank, becoming disconnected from their fleet. This temporary separation of the invading army from the navy provided the Ahoms with the opportunity they desired to launch a vigorous attack. The isolation of the Mughal fleet, coupled with the accidental absence of its admiral Ibn Husain (along with some ships) from the main fleet, emboldened the Ahoms to destroy the imperial fleet.\n\nOn the night of March 3, 1662, as the imperial fleet had recently anchored above Kaliabar, an Ahom armada of 700-800 ships under the command of its admiral Bargohain launched a sudden and vigorous assault on the Mughal fleet. Glanius reports that the enemy's fleet consisted of 600 ships. Meanwhile, upon hearing the night-long cannonade, Mir Jumla dispatched Muhammad Mumin Beg Ekkataz Khan to assist the beleaguered fleet, particularly the English, Dutch, and Portuguese ships in the Mughal army, which were erroneously reported by a Moorish informer to have been lost. Due to the lack of habitable areas, unstable ground, dense jungles, and muddy terrain, Muhammad Mumin was unable to reach the fleet during the night. However, he arrived early the next morning accompanied by 10 or 12 horsemen and ordered the trumpets to be blown. \nThis turn of events decisively determined the outcome of the stubborn contest. Encouraged by Muhammad Mumin's arrival, the Mughals intensified their efforts, while the demoralized Ahoms fled, some by boat and others on land. The Mughals captured around 300 or 400 ships, each armed with \"big guns,\" in addition to powder and lead. Since even the smallest ship accommodated 70 men, it is estimated that at least 21,000 men were taken as prisoners of war. Many were slain by the pursuing Mughal columns, who were instructed not to show mercy. The 50 Ahoms who managed to escape were sentenced by their king to undergo severe punishment. Although the Ahom admiral was captured despite his disguise, he was released at the request of some of Mir Jumla's senior officers. The remaining 300 Ahom vessels anchored about a mile away from Mir Jumla's camp, where they were sunk the following day by artillery fire. Those that fled to the other bank were pursued and some were captured. The effectiveness of the Assamese navy was completely annihilated as a result. This was the most decisive victory of Mir Jumla along his campaign against Ahoms.[14] \nThe reasons behind the Ahom navy's defeat are evident. Despite their overwhelming numerical superiority and the advantage of the upstream current, they failed to capitalize on these factors. While it initially seemed that the Mughal fleet would be overwhelmed by the sheer force of the Ahom fleet, the heavy Ahom \"bacharis\" manned by 60 or 70 men each were less maneuverable compared to the lighter and swifter Mughal \"kosas.\" Additionally, the Ahom cannons, although planted on their boats, were smaller and had limited range, as demonstrated by their inability to significantly damage the Mughal boats even at close range. The failure of the Ahom fleet to capture the hard-pressed Dutch vessels, which were temporarily separated from the main Mughal fleet, highlights the ineffectiveness of the Ahom navy. However, the close cooperation between the Mughal and European admirals, along with their determined fighting, enabled the Mughal fleet to withstand the crisis. The timely dispatch of Muhammad Mumin Beg by Mir Jumla to assist the imperiled imperial fleet ultimately tipped the scales in favor of the Mughals.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\nBy March 1662, the Mughal army proceeded inland, leaving the fleet behind, aiming to capture Garghaon, the capital from which the Ahom ruler and his court had fled. The spoils of war were substantial, including treasure, stored rice, weapons, and armed riverboats. With the onset of the rainy season, Mir Jumla stationed his forces near the capital, while the Ahoms severed the line of Mughal outposts leading back to the Brahmaputra fleet. From May to October, the Mughal army in the capital and the river fleet at Lakhau endured famine, disease, continuous Ahom assaults, and desertions.\nAs the rains ceased and supplies and reinforcements arrived, the Mughal army was able to confront the Ahoms once more. Ultimately, in early 1663, the Swargadeo (Heavenly King) and his nobles sought peace. The Ahom ruler agreed to become a Mughal vassal, send a daughter with a dowry for marriage to the imperial court, surrender significant treasure and elephants, and cede extensive territories in Darrang and western districts. Mir Jumla began organizing a phased withdrawal and the administration of the newly acquired districts, but he fell seriously ill and passed away in March 1663.\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nRoy, Atul Chandra (1972).

        "content": "An icaroscope is a telescope-like nonlinear optical device that enables viewing of both very bright and dark objects in the same image simultaneously. The problem the icaroscope was designed to solve was observing enemy aircraft approaching with the sun behind them, when the bright sun in a clear sky dazzles the observer and masks aircraft near the sun's disc. In the icaroscope, the scene is not viewed directly; instead it is briefly projected onto a screen coated with a special phosphor, and this screen is then shown to the viewer. The specific silver-activated zinc-cadmium sulphide phosphor has a short afterglow even in areas saturated by the full brightness of the sun. By rapidly exposing the phosphor, allowing it to decay for around 5 ms, and showing it to the viewer, the effect is to attenuate the brightness of the sun's disc by about 500 times, allowing details near it to be clearly seen. The icaroscope repeats this process at a rate of 90 Hz, permitting continuous observation.\nDevelopment of the icaroscope was carried out during the Second World War at the Institute of Optics by Brian O'Brien, Franz Urbach, and other researchers. The device is named for Icarus, the mythological figure known for flying too close to the sun.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Eberhard Aurich (born 10 December 1946) is a former German politician and high-ranking functionary of the Free German Youth (FDJ).\nIn the German Democratic Republic, he served as the First Secretary of the FDJ from 1983 to 1989. He was the last First Secretary before the Peaceful Revolution.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nEberhard Aurich was active as a child in the Ernst Thälmann Pioneer Organization and became a member of the FDJ in 1960. After attending the EOS Karl Marx in Karl-Marx-Stadt and completing vocational training with a high school diploma as a concrete specialist, he studied from 1965 to 1969 at the Pedagogical University of Zwickau, graduating as a certified teacher for German and Staatsbürgerkunde, civics designed to indoctrinate children to support the GDR's political system and the SED.\nAurich never worked as teacher, being immediately recruited into FDJ.\n\n\n=== Early FDJ career ===\n\nIn 1967, at the age of 21, he became a member of the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED).\nFrom 1969 onwards, he worked full-time for the FDJ, initially at the Bezirk leadership in Karl-Marx-Stadt, becoming a Secretary in 1971. From 1972 to 1977, he served as the deputy head of the student department of the Central Council of the FDJ.\nAurich returned to the Bezirk Karl-Marx-Stadt FDJ in 1977 as First Secretary. As such, he also served as statutory member of the Bezirk Karl-Marx-Stadt SED leadership. In 1979, he became a member of the Bureau of the Central Council. Here he became its Second Secretary in 1980 after incumbent Erich Postler joined the Bezirk Schwerin SED as Second Secretary.\nAurich was elected as a full member of the Central Committee of the SED in April 1981 (X. Party Congress), serving until its resignation in November 1989. He later described the Central Committee's work as rubber-stamping. He additionally became member of the Volkskammer in 1981.\n\n\n=== FDJ First Secretary ===\n\nIn December 1983, Aurich rose to the position of the First Secretary of the Central Council of the FDJ, succeeding Egon Krenz, who joined the Politburo and Secretariat of the Central Committee of the SED. Aurich also joined the State Council, the GDR's collective head of state, in 1986.\nDuring his leadership, the FDJ became more open. The FDJ organized concerts with Western artists such as Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen and was more open towards the LGBT community. In a 1988 letter, Aurich himself stated that \"I can assure you that the FDJ will continue to give great attention toward the complete equality of homosexual youth and other citizens in its diverse forms of political and ideological work.\"\nDuring his tenure, Aurich met future German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, then deputy chair of the Jusos, twice; in January 1984 alongside Egon Krenz and Herbert Häber and at a disarmament rally of the FDJ in Wittenberg in September 1987.\nAurich was awarded the Medal of Merit of the GDR and the Patriotic Order of Merit in Gold in 1981 and 1984.\n\n\n=== Peaceful Revolution ===\nDuring the Wende, on 24 November 1989, Aurich was deposed as the First Secretary and replaced by Bezirk Dresden FDJ First Secretary Frank Türkowsky, who held this position until the end of January 1990. The FDJ, the SED having lost power, lost almost all of its members and soon faded into obscurity.\nAurich resigned from the Volkskammer and the moribund State Council in late January 1990.\n\n\n=== Reunified Germany ===\nIn 1991, he left the SED's successor party, the PDS.\nAfter initially being unemployed, Aurich soon started working in video production. From 1990 until the end of 2011, Aurich was the managing director of trainmedia GmbH, a publishing house that produces the magazine \"Wortspiegel\" and books for children with reading and spelling difficulties.\nAurich has since distanced himself from the GDR. In 2014, he described the GDR in an interview with the Berliner Morgenpost as being gleichgeschaltet and Stalinist. He especially criticized his former superior and predecessor Egon Krenz.\nAurich lives in Berlin and is married for the second time. He volunteers in the Allende district of Berlin for the socially disadvantaged, elderly people, and refugees.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Dea Dardanica is an archaeological artifact found in Kosovo that represents an ancient deity associated with the Dardania region, located in the central-western Balkans, which encompasses parts of modern Kosovo and western North Macedonia.  \n\n\n== Overview ==\nDea Dardanica holds significance within the historical and cultural context of the Dardania region. While the exact nature of her worship and beliefs surrounding her vary, she is generally understood to have been revered by the indigenous Dardanian people. Dea Dardanica is often associated with themes such as protection, fertility, and possibly solar symbolism, although the exact nature of her attributes remains subject to interpretation. Imagery found on archaeological artifacts offers clues to these associations.\nOur understanding of Dea Dardanica primarily comes from archaeological discoveries, including inscriptions and votive altars, scattered throughout the Dardania region. These artifacts provide valuable evidence of her cult and shed light on the religious practices of the ancient inhabitants. With the establishment of Roman rule in the Balkans, the worship of Dea Dardanica likely underwent changes as local traditions intersected with Roman religious practices. Inscriptions and votive monuments from this period provide insights into how indigenous beliefs were interpreted within the framework of Roman culture.\nOverall, Dea Dardanica represents an intriguing aspect of the cultural and religious landscape of the Balkans during antiquity, reflecting the interplay between local traditions and external influences such as Roman rule.\n\n\n== See also ==\nKingdom of Dardania\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Manuel Ricardo González Guerra (April 25, 1914 – April 18, 1997) was a Cuban baseball executive and president of the International Baseball Federation (then known as the Asociación Internacional de Béisbol Amateur, or AINBA) from 1976 to 1980. He was the first president of the organization elected after the splinter group FEMBA rejoined in 1976.González, a boxer and amateur baseball player in his youth, was president of the Cuban amateur baseball league from 1950 to 1961. After the Cuban Revolution, he established the Cuban Baseball Federation as part of the INDER, the new sports ministry.González was also president of the Cuban Olympic Committee. His election to the AINBA presidency in 1976 was partly due to his ties with the International Olympic Committee (IOC), as AINBA sought to gain recognition for baseball as an Olympic sport. He was considered a close friend of Juan Antonio Samaranch, who became IOC president in 1980. After his tenure as AINBA president ended, González was present at the IOC meeting on 13 October 1986 where baseball was voted into the Olympic programme, starting at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona.González was arrested several times for his opposition to the dictatorships of Gerardo Machado and Fulgencio Batista; he joined Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement in 1957. As head of the Castro-era Cuban Olympic Committee, he was a staunch critic of the United States, leading Cuba's boycott of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles (despite the landmark inclusion of baseball as a demonstration sport) and alleging that the 1987 Pan American Games were awarded to Indianapolis over Havana due to pressure from the American State Department. However, he also described American baseball owner Peter O'Malley as \"his friend.\"His son, also Manuel González, was an Olympic fencer at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nRiccardo Schiroli (2019).

        "content": "Colette Bonzo (19 August 1916, Saron-sur-Aube — 14 January 1967, Paris) was a self-taught French painter. After marrying the Greek physician Élie Bontsolakis in 1939, she lived in Paris. She turned to painting after the Second World War, exhibiting frequently in Paris. In 1957, together with her husband she bought the Château du Pin in Ardèche where her brightly illuminated Impressionistic works were inspired by the sun and the surrounding countryside. Hundreds of her works including portraits, still lifes, large rose garden scenes and sketches are now exhibited there. Others can be seen in the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Bordeaux and in the Château de Tournon.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn on 10 August 1917 in the village of Saron-sur-Aube in the Marne department, Colette Bonzo studied French literature at the Sorbonne. In 1939, she married the Greek physician Élie Bontzolakis and lived with him in central Paris.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBonzo had shown an interest in art since her childhood but had no formal training. Encouraged by her husband, during the Second World War, she took up painting, producing large, brightly coloured canvasses inspired by Impressionism. Her early works drew on social, political and religious themes but also included still lifes. After the end of the war, she regularly exhibited her works in Paris where they received considerable acclaim.\nIn 1957, she and her husband bought the 16th-century Château du Pin in the Cévennes district of the Ardèche. Bonzo's painting took a new turn as she produced works full of light and colour depicting the surroundings and the local inhabitants. Le Bal au bois de PaÏolive (1964), exhibited in the château is typical of the works she created there. L'Ours et le Lion, a landscape depicting the nearby Paîolive rocks, is also exhibited,\nBonzo suffered from poor health over the years, including tuberculosis for two years from 1949 and cancer in 1962 which slowly led to her death. Even when ill, she continued to paint with enthusiasm. She participated in exhibitions every year until 1966 at the Salon des Femmes Peintres.\nColette Bonzo died in Paris on 14 January 1967 and was buried in the cemetery at Fabras. In addition to the Château du Pin, many of her works have also been presented at the Château-Musée de Tournon-sur-Rhône.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Aniana Ondina Vargas Jáquez (13 March 1930 – 16 December 2002) was a Dominican democracy and environmental activist. After a period in exile in the United States during the regime of Rafael Trujillo, Vargas returned to the Dominican Republic following his assassination in 1961 where, following the 1963 coup d'état that ousted Trujillo's democratically elected successor, Juan Bosch, she became one of the most prominent female members of the constitutionalist June 14th Revolutionary Movement during the subsequent civil war in 1965. Later in her life, Vargas became known as an environmental activist and land defender, earning the nickname La Madre de las Aguas (\"the mother of the waters\") due to her work on the preservation of the Yuma River.\n\n\n== Early life and exile ==\nVargas was born in Bonao, Monseñor Nouel, Dominican Republic, to Marcelino Antonio Vargas García and Eugenia Elicia Jáquez Abreu. By 1956, she was a prominent anti-Trujillo activist in Bonao, though in 1959, she fled the country following threats and harassments she and her family experienced from Trujillo's security forces, including the Servicio de Inteligenica Militar. Vargas settled in New York City in the United States, where she continued to support Manolo Tavárez Justo, a revolutionary who had been married to Minerva Mirabal Reyes, one of the Mirabal sisters who were murdered at Trujillo's orders in 1960.\n\n\n== Anti-triumvirate activism and civil war ==\nTrujillo was assassinated in May 1961; while he had been succeeded by his son Ramfis Trujillo, by November the Trujillo family were pressured into exile, leaving for France, and Vargas returned to the Dominican Republic that same year. Vargas was a supporter of Juan Bosch, who became the country's first democratically elected president in February 1963. By November, a coup d'état by the Dominican Army had ousted Bosch and replaced him with a military junta under a triumvirate model.\nFollowing the coup, Justo reformed his anti-Trujillo group into the June 14th Revolutionary Movement; from 1963 until 1964, Vargas took part in resistance activities against the triumvirate, operating underground to avoid persecution. On 24 April 1965, Vargas participated in the April Revolution, which saw a second coup d'état which ousted the militarily installed president, Donald Reid Cabral, triggering the Dominican Civil War.\nDuring the war, which lasted from April to September 1965, Vargas initially was assigned to a command on Calle Juan de Morfa in Santo Domingo, which saw significant fighting between the pro-military loyalist and the constitutionalist factions. Vargas gained recognition as a prominent female member of the constitutionalist movement, and, alongside Roberto Duvergé, established the Academia 24 de Abril, a combatant training facility in Eugenio María de Hostos Park. Vargas subsequently commanded revolutionary activities in the Padres Las Casas, Azula, and in the rural communities of Puerto Plata.\nIn June 1965, Vargas was among six female resistance members who were sent to China to receive further training. She subsequently experienced the Cultural Revolution during her time in the country. While Vargas was abroad, the loyalists won the civil war, with a ceasefire and new elections being agreed. She returned to the Dominican Republic in 1968.\n\n\n== Subsequent environmental activism ==\nDuring the 1980s, Vargas was the leader of the Manolo Tavárez Justo Foundation and was a vocal critic of the economic stabilisation programme agreed by the International Monetary Fund and the government of Salvador Jorge Blanco, which saw mandated price increases in 1984.\nBy the end of the decades, Vargas had re-emerged as an environmental activist and land defender in her home province of Monseñor Nouel. She led a successful campaign against Falconbridge Dominicana, a ferronickel mining company that sought to operate in Bonao. The campaign led to Vargas establishing the Federation of Farmers Towards Progress (Spanish: Federación de Campesinos hacia el Progreso), which advocated for the rights of farmers and people living in rural areas of the Dominican Republic, including by fighting land evictions and encouraging the preservation and protection of natural ecosystems by their local communities, including the Yuna River basin.\nVargas became a regular contributor for El Nacional, where she wrote columns primarily focused on issues facing the environment, as well as farmers and rural communities.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nVargas died on 16 December 2002 in Bonao, of natural causes at the age of 72. She was later buried in the town.\nThe Dominican government named the Aniana Vargas National Park after her. Located primarily in her home province, it includes within it the Hatillo Dam, the largest freshwater reservoir in the Caribbean, and is also a noted location of prehistoric cave paintings. The Yuna River, which Vargas spent the last decades of her life defending, runs through the park.\nA street named after Vargas exists in her hometown of Bonao.\nA documentary about Vargas, entitled Aniana Vargas: la mariposa entre hortensias (\"Aniana Vargas: The Butterfly between Hydrangeas) and directed by Max Garcia, premiered in 2012.\n\n\n== References ==",

They are found in tree species primarily in bark, needles, xylem, of the family of Cupressaceae like the Cupressus, Thuja, Juniperus and Thujopsis. The thujaplicinols are structurally equivalent to the thujaplicins with an additional hydroxyl group. They belong to the class of natural terpenoids having two free hydroxyl groups at C3 and C5 position.\nThe thujaplicinols are highly volatile compounds. It is known that the presence of such tropolones, including alpha-tropolone and its isopropyl derivatives, result in the high natural durability of wood species, such as western red cedar, juniper and cypress.\n\n\n== Uses ==\nAlpha-thujaplicinol, an isomer of thujaplicinol, is often encountered in the Asian species of Thujopsis dolabrata, and exhibits high antibacterial and antifungal activities. It has been found to be effective against Enterococcus faecalis and Legionella pneumophila, even at low inhibitory concentrations (1.56 to 50 mg/ml).\nIn a 2004 study, α-thujaplicinol showed to have high cytotoxic effects upon several cancer cell lines, such as human stomach cancer and murine lymphocytic leukemia.\nThe other isomer of the compound is called β-thujaplicinol. A recent study found out that it inhibited the development of hepatocellular carcinoma cells because it triggered the autophagic cell death and a subsequent apoptosis.\nEarlier studies have shown that β-thujaplicinol can addiotionally suppress estrogen-dependent breast cancer by regulating the estrogen receptor signaling.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Reform UK–TUV alliance is an electoral pact for the next United Kingdom general election in Northern Ireland between the right-wing populist, Reform UK party and the British unionist and national conservative, Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV). The two parties will stand mutually agreed candidates in up to 18 constituencies in Northern Ireland.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe alliance between the two parties was born following the decision of Northern Ireland's largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), to re-enter devolved power sharing government at Stormont, ending their boycott over the Northern Ireland Protocol on 3 February 2024. This led the TUV to label the DUP as \"Protocol implementers.\" Former Reform UK MEP, Ben Habib, had previously launched a legal challenge against the NI Protocol alongside TUV leader Jim Allister in February 2021. \n\n\n== Platform ==\nThe electoral pact was announced at the TUV party conference on 16 March 2024, accompanied with a speech from Reform UK leader Richard Tice. The leaders of both parties signed a \"Memorandum of Understanding\" which outlined a common platform: \n\nupholding and strengthening the Union between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, including the full restoration of Art 6 of the Act(s) of Union;\nequal rights for all citizens within the United Kingdom;\nrejection of the Irish Sea border and the subjection of Northern Ireland to EU law and the ECJ;\nthe completion of a full Brexit so that the United Kingdom in all its parts enjoys full independence and economic freedom;\nrobust immigration system and controls;\na taxation system, both personal and commercial, which rewards effort.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nIt has been speculated that the alliance could lead to a splitting of the unionist vote and ultimately mean fewer DUP MPs are elected, due to the first-past-the-post electoral system used for Westminster elections. The DUP MP for East Antrim, Sammy Wilson, highlighted this in a critical statement following the formation of the alliance, which he slammed as \"absurd\" and \"self-destructive.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

During this period, more of 20 schools conducted regular Korean language classes and 25 schools conducted Korean hobby classes. Since the revised National Education Policy of India introduced Korean as one of the elective subjects for a second language, the acceptance of Korean language classes in schools in India has been steadily increasing.\n\n\n== Current status ==\nAs of April 2023, about 2,500 students enrolled in Korean language learning, including 21 regular classes and 17 hobby classes.\nIn general schools, Korean language classes are usually available for grades 6-8.

        "content": "Calamur Chandrasekhara Sastri (1854–1887), sometimes Sastry or Sastriyar, was the first Principal and Professor of English and Sanskrit of the Maharajah's College at Vizianagaram from his appointment in 1875, developing it from a secondary school with four teachers into a graduate institution before his death at the age of 32 in 1887, with the support of the contemporaneously reigning Maharajas of Vizianagaram, Pusapati Vijayarama Gajapathi Raju III and Pusapati Ananda Gajapati Raju. He was the first Indian principal of any South Indian college at the time.\nSastri was born to C. Sivarama Sastri and his wife Lakshmi, into the Calamur dynasty; his nephew C. Sivaramamurti dedicated his Chitrasūtra of the Vishṇudharmottara to him and credited him with raising his father, C. Sundara Sastri. He was also maternal uncle to N. Subrahmanyam and Bharati Krishna Tirtha, and namesake to his cousin Rao Saheb Calamur Chandrasekhara Iyer, Sub-Registrar of Madras and Assistant Registrar of the High Court.\nAfter the death of a young Gurajada Apparao's father, Sastri took him in, covering his expenses and fees; Apparao would revere him as a father-figure thereafter. Apparao's ability to speak English was substantially owed to Sastri.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Patrick Joseph Rooney (1848 – 28 March 1892), often referred to as Pat Rooney Sr. or Pat Rooney the Elder, was an English-born Irish American actor, comedian, songwriter, dancer, and vaudeville performer. He should not be confused with his son Pat Rooney (1880–1962), known variously as Pat Rooney Jr. and Pat Rooney Sr., or his grandson Pat Rooney (1909–1975), also an actor and dancer known as Pat Rooney Jr.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\n\nBorn into an Irish family in Birmingham, England in 1848, Rooney grew up in Bolton and began his career performing in British music halls. There are conflicting reports over when he immigrated to the United States. Most scholars give stronger credence to an account that he arrived in New York City in 1867 at the age of 19 and made his American debut at the Bowery Theatre three years later in 1870. However, another account states he first arrived in Philadelphia in 1871 and made his American debut that year at Fox's Theatre in that city.\nRooney gained a reputation as a gifted comedian and dancer on the vaudeville stage from the 1870s until his death in 1892. He wrote his own songs, and became famous for his clog dancing which he often did to his original tunes. Some of his more successful songs that gained popularity among the American public of his day included, \"Is that Mr. Reilly?\", \"Pretty Peggy\", and \"The Day I Played Baseball\".\nRooney was married to Josie Granger Rooney with whom he had one son, Pat Rooney Jr. and four daughters: Kate, Mattie, Josie, and Julia. His children performed with him on the vaudeville stage as The Rooneys in a family act, and several of them had careers in entertainment, with his son being the most successful.\nPat Rooney died of pneumonia on 28 March 1892 in New York City.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nMaloney, Paul (2016).

        "content": "The Kansas, Oklahoma Central and Southwestern Railway (“KOC&S”) was a railroad which in 1899 built tracks from a point near Caney, Kansas to what became Owasso, Oklahoma.  After foreclosure in 1900, it was absorbed into the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (“AT&SF”).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Kansas, Oklahoma Central and Southwestern Railway Company was incorporated under the laws of both the Territory of Oklahoma on June 14, 1893, and the State of Kansas on August 17, 1894.  The railroad had big plans: in order to tap the growing cattle industry, it would run from its headquarters in Cherryvale, Kansas generally southwest through Bartlesville, Oklahoma (then in Indian Territory), on through Guthrie, Oklahoma (then in Oklahoma Territory), and terminate in Vernon, Texas.  The KOC&S obtained the necessary authorizations from Congress dated December 21, 1893, February 15, 1897, and the last in February 1899, allowing its main line to run through Bartlesville, Pawhuska, Pawnee, Stillwater, Guthrie and El Reno, and even allowing a separate branch line starting from near Bartlesville to run south through Collinsville, Okmulgee, Wewoka, and Tishomingo to Sherman, Texas.\nAgainst that backdrop, the company did preliminary location and grading work running south from the Kansas-Oklahoma border near Caney through to Collinsville.  But in February 1899, agreement was reached for ownership of the railroad to be turned over to the AT&SF.  All work after that point was actually done by the AT&SF, which choose to have some of the congressionally-authorized trackage assembled by other AT&SF affiliates, an example being the Guthrie through Stillwater to Pawnee section constructed by the Eastern Oklahoma Railway.  The line built in 1899 under the KOC&S name was a single standard-gauge track, leased to and operated by the AT&SF, which started from the Kansas-Oklahoma border just south of Caney, Kansas, and specifically from a point on that border known as Owen, Oklahoma.  It proceeded south, passing through Bartlesville, Oklahoma which had eagerly awaited a railroad since the very-productive Nellie Johnstone No. 1 oil well had been completed in 1897 but had to be capped while awaiting a way to move the production to more lucrative markets.  The line continued to just west of Collinsville (to avoid crossing an additional creek in route to the town), causing the town to move its wooden buildings on rollers to the new location next to the tracks.  The line dead-ended further south at a depot about one mile from a man-made lake.  This locale was just far enough south to reach cattle drives from ranches along Bird Creek, but was about three miles northwest of the nearest town, which was called Elm Creek.  The completed line aggregated 56.85 miles.  Referring to the end of the railroad, that area became known unofficially by the Osage or possibly Cherokee name of  “Owasso,” meaning “end of the trail” or “the turn around.”  Businesses and residences from Elm Creek began moving to the depot site, causing the original Elm Creek settlement to be essentially abandoned.  The official postal designation for the relocated town was changed from Elm Creek to Owasso on January 24, 1900.\nThe railroad was sold at foreclosure June 29, 1900, ending up being absorbed into the AT&SF on July 2, 1900.  In subsequent history, the AT&SF extended the tracks into Tulsa in 1905.  After further changes in ownership over time, the route continues to be run today, now operated by the South Kansas and Oklahoma Railroad.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Manuel Francisco dos Anjos Ferreira, also known as Manuel dos Anjos Ferreira or Manuel Balaio (1784–1841), was a straw basket (or balaio) maker that became one of the main leaders of the Balaiada, a revolt against the Brazilian monarchy that occurred between 1838 to 1841 in the state of Maranhão. His nickname came from the balaios that he would sell in places like his hometown of Coroatá and in Itapecuru Mirim. It is unknown what led him to take arms; it has been said that it was vengeance due to a soldier raping his daughter, while others posit that it was to avoid his children being recruited by force.\nMany people in Maranhão, including enslaved people, free Black people, farmers, and vaqueiros, became the main groups of people involved in the Balaiada, which began in Maranhão, but later spread to the states of Piauí and Ceará. They were excluded from political life, with much of the population living in slavery. Together with the dire living conditions in the state, while also being forced to serve in the military, they rebelled in 1838 against the conservative elite, represented by large-scale property owners and military personnel. They fought against the troops of the Brazilian Empire for four years.\nAfter Manuel Balaio's death during the rebellion and when co-leader Raimundo Gomes' men were defeated by Luis Alves de Lima e Silva, the future Duke of Caxias, Cosme Bento (a formerly enslaved man and a quilombo leader who was one of the other main leaders of the \"balaios\") assumed leadership of the movement. The strength of the \"balaios\" began to diminish as, in 1840, a large number of the rebels surrendered due to a concession deal being made. Shortly afterwards, the rest of the army surrendered. After he was captured, Cosme Bento was sentenced to death by hanging.\n\n\n== References ==",

The team race at the Markéta Stadium.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nFollowing the end of World War II, the Czechoslovak military began forming sports teams and regional and national competitions. In 1953, a law (following the Soviet model) determined that all clubs should be voluntary sports societies, with athletes being allocated to clubs according to their civic occupation. The speedway team and stadium was closely associated with the Czechoslovak police force and the speedway team started life known as Rudá Hvězda Praha (Red Star Prague). It was not until the fall of Real socialism in the Eastern Bloc countries, that the club changed its name to Olymp Praha. On 9 July 1990, the company called Autoklub Markéta at PSK Olymp Praha was established.\nThe team were champions of the former Czechoslovakia on 26 occasions, winning the first seven editions of the competition and then winning a further 19 times until the Dissolution of Czechoslovakia. The dominance of Prague speedway was such that the club ran two teams in the top division (Olymp Praha A and Olmyp Praha B) and another called Markéta in 1.Liga. The origins of the name Markéta is unknown.\nContinuing its connection with the police, the team raced as PSK (Policejní sportovní klub) Olymp Praha (and then Olymp Praha again) competing in the Extraliga. They won the Extraliga eight times from 1992 until 2003.\nIn 2015, the club became known solely as AK Markéta Praha and in 2023 became champions of the country for the fourth time with the prefix Markéta. \n\n\n== See also ==\nPrague Speedway\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Palazzo Tarasconi, also known as Palazzo Soragna Tarasconi, is a Renaissance-style aristocratic palace located on Strada Luigi Carlo Farini #37 in the historical centre of Parma, Italy.\n\n\n== History and description ==\nThe palace was built atop the foundations of medieval structures, commissioned in the late 16th century by brothers Scipione and Alessandro Tarasconi, and likely designed by Giovanni Francesco Testa, although some work may have been modified or completed by Giovanni Battista Magnani.\nThe brick facade we see today was left unfinished in 16th century. In 1858, it was inherited by marchese Luigi Lupo Meli Lupi di Soragna. Presently owned by Corrado Galloni, the palace hosts contemporary art exhibitions and cultural events.\nThe palace is notable for the Renaissance-era frescoes in the entrance stairs and in the piano nobile. Some are attributed to Cesare Baglione or some of his followers Girolamo Curti, Angelo Michele Colonna, and Giovanni Maria Conti della Camera.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sinéad Kelly was an Irish prostitute who was murdered in an alleged contract killing in Dublin City on 22 June 1998. As of 2024, her murder remains unsolved.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSinéad Kelly was 21 years old at the time of her death. She was from Santry and working as a prostitute in order to earn money to fund her heroin addiction. Despite her addiction, the toxicology tests performed following her death determined she only had prescription drugs in her system at the time of her death. \nShe had successfully overcome addiction once before following treatment. However, she relapsed into addiction and returned to prostitution following a stabbing and rape which occurred on a night out with a friend.\n\n\n== Death ==\nAt 12:30am on 22 June 1998, at Herbert Place on the banks of the Grand Canal, a witness heard a woman scream \"God someone help, someone please, please help me\". Gardaí were called and Sinéad Kelly was found deceased. It was later determined that she had died after being stabbed 18 times to her head, neck, chest, and back. The same witness reported seeing a man jog away from the scene. He was reported to be a well-built man wearing a tight black leather jacket which had a buckle on the left shoulder. He also wore dark jeans and a knitted wool hat.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nGardaí believe Kelly was lured to her death and that the murder may be linked to a drug debt she owed to a heroin dealer. Rosie Lakes, a heroin addict and prostitute, alleged that she was given heroin from her and Kelly's dealer in exchange for pointing Kelly out to this dealer's associates. Lakes was the state's only witness in Kelly's murder and the DPP recommendation that these men be charged was dropped following the death of Rosie Lakes from tainted heroin.\nTwo men were arrested early into the investigation, including one man reportedly linked to a Crumlin-based crime family, but both were released without charge. A man from Dublin was also questioned about her murder in Kensington, London.\nGardaí linked the murder to another attack on a prostitute which took place in September 1998 in Dublin. During this attack, a 28-year-old woman was stabbed with a Stanley knife on Benburb Street, a noted area for prostitution in Dublin at the time. Gardaí believe the same drug dealing gang that killed Kelly targeted this woman as she could potentially help Gardaí investigate her murder.\nIn 2017, a Garda informant implicated an unnamed suspect in Sinéad Kelly's murder in the disappearance of Trevor Deely in Dublin in December 2000.\n\n\n== Media reaction ==\nFollowing her murder and the subsequent attack on the unnamed 28-year-old woman, media in Ireland were said to have \"label[led]\" Kelly. The Irish Independent wrote about the sex trade following the murder, describing prostitutes in the area of the attack as 'junkies'. The Sunday World referred to Sinéad Kelly as a 'teen hooker' despite her being 21-years-old at the time of her murder.\n\n\n== Impact ==\nFollowing the murder, there was criticism of some aspects of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993. The act, which prohibited solicitation or importuning for purposes of prostitution as well as loitering for purposes of prostitution, was criticised in the March 1999 issue of the Workers Solidarity Movement's newspaper, Workers Solidarity, which stated that the anti-soliciting laws had made Sinéad Kelly \"an easy target\".\nWriting in the Irish Independent, journalist Bruce Arnold discussed Kelly's murder and described the 1993 act as \"draconian\" while calling on the Irish government to better protect prostitutes.\nIn 2017, Ireland passed the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 which decriminalises prostitution but criminalises the purchases of sex, following the Nordic model approach to prostitution.\n\n\n== References ==",

With Ranglin's Below the Baseline, Yard Movement was the first album from Island Records' Island Jamaica Jazz label. The album peaked at No. 25 on the Official Jazz & Blues Albums Chart. Alexander subsequently formed a band he named Yard Movement.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThree songs were recorded at the 1995 Montreux Jazz Festival. \"Exodus\" is a combination of the \"Theme of Exodus\" with Bob Marley's \"Exodus\". Lennox \"Boogsie\" Sharpe played steelpan on \"Crying\". \"Regulator\" was inspired by Nat Adderley's \"Work Song\". Ernest Ranglin played lead guitar on Yard Movement.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe St. Louis Post-Dispatch wrote that \"a technical bravado and engaging emotionalism mark the eight compositions of Yard Movement, Alexander favoring ripening glissandos to achieve his notable effects.\" The Guardian determined that Yard Movement \"does capture much of the infectious appeal of his live shows, shows how effectively his improvising can avoid repetition when he's hot, and presents a crisp and energetic band.\" The South Wales Evening Post noted that the album \"demonstrates his early musical influences and social experiences.\" The Houston Chronicle opined that Alexander \"sounds like an herbally fortified cocktail pianist gone mad,\" and listed the album among the best of 1996.\nAllMusic wrote: \"Essentially smooth bop laid in over heavy reggae basslines, the tracks on Yard Movement ... work surprisingly well, grooving and shifting directions with a deceptive ease, and Ranglin's bright, bubbly guitar is a continual delight throughout.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Cinderella\" is a song by American rapper Future, American record producer Metro Boomin, and fellow American rapper and singer Travis Scott. It was released through Freebandz (under the business name Wilburn Holding Co.), Boominati Worldwide, Epic Records, and Republic Records as the ninth track from Future and Metro's collaborative studio album, We Don't Trust You, on March 22, 2024. The three artists wrote the song together and it was produced by Metro himself, Allen Ritter, and Dre Moon.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSnippets of the song (also referred to as \"Family Forever\") were leaked to various platforms such as X and YouTube in late 2023, with unfinished portions completed using artificial intelligence. The song was initially believed to be an outtake from Travis Scott's Utopia. One unofficial uploading of the song (titled \"Utopia Cinderella\"), has amassed almost 3 million plays on Spotify, while another version of the song on YouTube has amassed over one million views.\nOn March 18, 2024, Future and Metro headlined the Rolling Loud music festival in California where they, alongside Scott, performed the song.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nMichael Saponara of Billboard ranked \"Cinderella\" as the sixth best song on We Don't Trust You. Saponara remarked that \"La Flame gets the best of Pluto in this round, with a woozy assist.\" He also wrote, \"It’s always great when a snippet lives up to the hype.\"\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ellen Mary Ibberson (13 December 1892 – 6 May 1979) was a British musician and teacher, who founded the first Rural Music School. She was the Founder-Director of the Rural Music Schools Association, which she led for 33 years.\n\n\n== Life ==\nEllen Mary Ibberson was born on 13 December 1892 in Hunstanton, Norfolk.\nIbberson took courses in German and piano in Dresden in 1911. She returned to England in 1913 to the new Garden City at Letchworth in Hertfordshire. Ibberson took part in activities including folk dancing and the Girl Guides, as well as becoming involved in campaigns for women's suffrage.\nIbberson worked at the Settlement in Letchworth Garden City, an adult education organization which was founded in 1920, initially as a tutor. Ibberson was the sub-warden, and ran a music appreciation course there before founding her Rural Music School.\n\n\n== Rural Music Schools ==\nIn 1929, Ibberson founded the first Rural Music School in Hitchin, Hertfordshire. According to Ibberson, the idea grew from the activities of the Educational Settlements Association for promoting adult education, \"filling leisure with pursuits of the mind,\" as well as directly from the request of two young men wanting to play the violin.\nIbberson's original school sought to make music teaching available to adults, who had not had access to it in their youth. Ibberson emphasised that the goal of the rural music schools was not concerts and performance, but to learn music, and to bring together musicians, professional and amateur, to learn from one another. It was not, she said, \"what we shall do with music so much as what we shall be as a result of it that really matters\". Also in 1929, Ibberson founded the Hitchin Symphony Orchestra (originally the Hitchin Concert Orchestra), run for many years as an evening class at North Hertfordshire College, before becoming the Hitchin Symphony Orchestra in 1997.\n\nIbberson's stated aim was \"to make good teaching available to amateurs of all ages, not in the large centres of professional music but in country towns and villages\". The 1930 prospectus for the Rural Music School established its \"primary concern\" as being:to promote musical endeavour in its social forms. Students are encouraged to become useful members of choirs, orchestras, quartets and music-clubs. A desire to learn and willingness to work are the only qualifications needed for membership.By 1935, the Federation of Rural Music Schools had been formed, with Ibberson as the organizing secretary. In 1929 there had been one school, two teachers, four classes, and 40 students; in 1937, there were 4 schools and 1,700 students; by 1950, there were 9 schools, 200 teachers, 700 classes and 7,000 students.\nMargery Spring Rice established the Suffolk Rural Music School, in memory of her son Stephen. Although the school no longer exists, much of its work is continued by Britten Pears Arts. Barbara Stephen also founded two rural music schools, serving on the Hampshire committee of rural music schools, and later becoming vice-chair of the Central Council of Rural Music Schools.\nIn 1953, the Rural Music Schools Association moved to new premises in Hitchin - a house, garden, and cottage bequeathed by Esther Seebohm, \"to be used in perpetuity for the support of music-making\". The building contained a memorial to Editha Knocker, a violin teacher and co-founder of an instrument loan programme, who had been a significant supporter of the Rural Music Schools. Ibberson wrote that \"she backed it with generosity and enthusiasm. She enlisted the support of eminent musicians of the day, she gave her own time and skill freely in rehearsing and teaching, and she backed appeals for money by personal example\".\nIn 1955, Ibberson was awarded the OBE for services to music.\n\n\n== Retirement and death ==\nOn her retirement in 1962, a special concert was held at the Royal College of Music in Ibberson's honour. The concert was conducted by Adrian Boult, with a programme which included a specially composed work by Imogen Holst, and performances by many of Ibberson's former students and colleagues. Ibberson was succeeded by Helen Wright, who worked for the Association since 1941, first as secretary and later as assistant director.\nIn 1977, Ibberson published For Joy That We Are Here: Rural Music Schools 1929-50. In a 1976 interview, Bernard Shore described Ibberson \"one of the most wonderful women I’ve ever met because she had vision (though she never thought the organisation would grow as it has), and was always striving for standards in the amateur music world\".\nMary Ibberson died in Dorset on 6 May 1979.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Dhruva Harsh is an Indian film director, filmmaker and writer who is predominantly known for his work in Hindi cinema. He has directed numerous Hindi films, including Honourable Mention (2015), Harshit (2018), Do I Exist: A Riddle (2019), The Last Sketch (2020), and Elham (2023).\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHe is originally from the Gonda district of Uttar Pradesh, India. Dhruva completed his master's degree, followed by a PhD in English in 2017 from the University of Allahabad. He is an alumnus of Ewing Christian College, Allahabad. He was trained in the nuances of dramaturgy under the aegis of stalwarts such as Prof Sachin Tewari and Pravin Shekhar.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 2015, he wrote and directed Honourable Mention, a film based on a short story from the collection Song Without End and Other Stories by Neelum Saran Gour. The film received positive acclaim, winning the Best Screenplay award at the Rolling Reels International Film Festival in Hyderabad.\nIn 2018, Dhruva Harsh wrote and directed the short film Harshit, starring Satyajeet Dubey, inspired by William Shakespeare's Hamlet. He later entered the OTT space with the release of his film Harshit on Amazon Prime in 2019  and Disney+ Hotstar in 2020. The film garnered selection in various film festivals and earned him the Best Director award at the International Short Film Festival in Pune.\nA year later, in 2019, he directed the short film Do I Exist: A Riddle, which screened at the Pondicherry International Film Festival and the International Film Festival of Shimla. It was also an official selection at the 5th Panorama International Film Festival in Tunisia and the Jaipur International Film Festival. In 2020, he directed The Last Sketch, a feature documentary centered on hand-rickshaw pullers in Kolkata.\nIn 2023, he directed the feature film Elham, which was selected as the only children's film from India at the 24th Rainbow International Film Festival in London. The film also premiered at the 21st Dhaka International Film Festival in Bangladesh in January 2023. In February 2023, Dhruva Harsh directed and wrote his second feature film, Parable, based on Plato's allegory, exploring the academic world and its politics.\nBefore venturing into film direction, he authored plays, starting with his 2012 debut, The Burning Instinct, followed by Che – A Romantic Revolutionary in 2013 and Cigarette and Shakespeare in 2014. He also released a collection of Hindi poetry under the title Aye Zindagi Tu Ret To Nahi.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nIn September 2019, Dhruva Harsh declined to accept his PhD degree and boycotted the convocation ceremony of  Allahabad University in protest against Nobel laureate Kailash Satyarthi, the chief guest, alleging selective degree distribution due to time constraints. Harsh raised concerns that Satyarthi would only present medals, leaving degree conferral to someone else, deeming it disrespectful to PhD recipients.\nHe also criticized the university's decision to award an honorary degree to O. P. Singh, then Director General of the Uttar Pradesh Police. Following his protest, on the day before the scheduled program, DGP Singh refused to accept the honorary degree from Allahabad University.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDhruva Harsh at IMDb",

        "content": "Evelyn Waddington (5 July 1857 – 25 August 1928) was a Welsh footballer and cricketer, who played in the 1877 FA Cup final for Oxford University.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nWaddington was the sixth son of Alexander Joseph Waddington of Llanllowell.  He was educated at Westminster School, an early adopter of association laws, on an open scholarship.  He represented the school at football and cricket.\n\n\n== Football career ==\nWaddington first represented his school against external opposition in November 1873, striking a post in the 1–0 win over the Gitanos.  His first goal came with a \"beautiful kick\" later in the month against the 1st Surrey Rifles; the school won 4–1.\nHe remained a regular for the school until the end of the 1875–76 season, by which time he was regularly playing as full-back or, more usually, half-back.\nIn 1876, he went up to Oriel College, Oxford.  He made his debut for the Dark Blues in a 1–0 win over the Wanderers in the Parks in November, playing as half-back.  He was not a regular player; he only played in three such matches (including another win over the Wanderers), and as one of the two full-backs in Oxford's 1–0 win over Cambridge University in the Varsity match.\nIn the 1876–77 FA Cup he did not make an appearance until the last 5 stage, as half-back in the university's draw with Upton Park at the Kennington Oval.  He played in the replay and with the last kick of the game cleared an Upton Park corner to clinch the tie for the university.\nOxford had a bye into the final and Waddington \"scored\" the opening goal against the Wanderers, when a corner fell to him, and his hard shot pushed goalkeeper Arthur Kinnaird over the line with the ball; the decision to give the goal \"seemed to be quite correct, and fully confirmed by the spectators in the vicinity of the Wanderers' goal\".  Oxford could not hold on to the lead and the Wanderers took the Cup in extra time.\nIn the 1877–78 FA Cup, he proved adept at the new law on throw-ins, a skill first exploited in the fourth round tie against the Royal Engineers.  In the Varsity that season, he played as half-back; this time however the Cantabs won 5–1.  He continued playing for the university until 1889, captaining the side against Darwen in the 1878-79 FA Cup and Great Marlow in the following season, and his final match for the university was in a draw against the Old Etonians in November 1879.  He finished his football career with a handful of old boy matches for the Old Westminsters, his last recorded match being a 4–1 defeat against the Old Wykehamists in December 1882, which he played in goal.\n\n\n== Post-university ==\nBetween 1882 and 1886, he played a handful of matches for Monmouthshire County Cricket Club.\nHe married Lucy Jane Gustard in Llanbadoc on 18 January 1894, and the couple had a son and a daughter.\nWaddington became a solicitor, and was clerk to the bench of magistrates in Usk.  He died at his home, Beech House in Usk, on 25 August 1928, leaving his estate to his widow.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Facundo Nazareno Saxe (January 22, 1981) is an Argentinian literature professor and researcher.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSaxe was born in Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina. He obtained his degree at the National University of La Plata in 2009, and went on to become a Doctor of Letters in 2014. Since then he is a researcher at the CInIG (Interdisciplinary Center of Gender Studies) within CONICET and teaches German literature at the same university. His fields of research include German literature, comparative literature, queer theory and comics studies.\n\n\n=== Attacks by the far right ===\nThe rise of the far right in Argentina since 2019 led to an attack on state-funded science. CONICET researchers were accused of being \"ñoquis\" in traditional and social media and there were calls for the defunding or outright closure of the institution. Within this context, Saxe was chosen by prominent personalities such as vicepresident Villarruel and journalist Eduardo Feinmann as a prime example of the \"uselessness\" of all state-funded science. Some of his works were cherry-picked for their provocative titles to spark outrage in society, most notably one which mentioned \"anal comics\". This was taken literally to claim that all Argentinian scientists do is \"waste their time researching Batman's anus\". Saxe receives ongoing harrassment amounting to death threats as a consequence.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\nSaxe, Facundo.  Disidencias sexuales.

        "content": "Birthday Girl is a 2023 Danish thriller film directed by Michael Noer. The film follows a mother (Trine Dyrholm) and daughter (Flora Ofelia Hoffmann Lindahl) who grapple with the aftermath of a sexual assault while on a cruise ship. \n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nBirthday Girl is a psychological thriller/drama that takes place over 3 days on a cruise ship bound for the Caribbean. 42-year-old Nanna takes her daughter Cille and Cille's best friend on the cruise to celebrate her daughter's 18th birthday. On the first night, Nanna and Cille get into a fight and Nanna goes off on her own, leaving the girls at the ship's nightclub. Early in the morning, Nanna is woken by the ship's crew who inform her that her daughter has been found sleeping on the deck of the ship. Cille informs her mother that she has no memory of the night before but that she believes she has been sexually assaulted.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nTrine Dyrholm as Nanna\nFlora Ofelia Hoffmann Lindahl as Cille\nHerman Tømmeraas\nMaja Ida Thiele as Lea\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe script for Birthday Girl was written by Jesper Fink and Michael Noer, with the latter directing the film. Noer was inspired by an article he read about the number of cases of sexual assault occurring on cruise ships, where they are in international waters. The film was produced by Matilda Appelin and René Ezra of the Nordisk Film Production. Birthday Girl, which was produced for a budget of €3.5m, received financial backing from the Danish Film Institute, the Norwegian Film Institute and Nordisk Film & TV Fond. The director of photography was Adam Wallensten and the editor was Jacob Thuesen.\nBirthday Girl was filmed in Estonia, receiving the Film Estonia cash rebate programme. The film was shot at Tallinn Harbour, using the ships that were docked in the harbour due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some scenes were shot at the Tallink Spa & Conference hotel and the Black Box Studio in Viimsi. Beginning on 16 March 2022, filming occurred over 24 days and wrapped in April 2022. The film employed more than 600 extras, with a 100-member production team on location.\n\n\n== Release ==\nIn November 2022, TrustNordisk sold the rights in Germany, Austria and Switzerland to Plaion and in Benelux to Cherry Pickers. Birthday Girl had its world premiere at the 2023 Zürich Film Festival. The film was screened at the Gothenburg Film Festival in January 2024. It had its United States premiere at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival the following month. The film is due to be released in Denmark on April 4, 2024.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film was praised in a review by Tobias Åkesson of the Gothenburg Film Festival, who complimented the performances by Dyrholm and Hoffmann Lindahl.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBirthday Girl at IMDb",

        "content": "Mohammed Raheem (born 10 August 2003) is a Fijian footballer who currently plays for Fiji Premier League club Ba and the Fiji national team.\n\n\n== Club career ==\nRaheem began his career in the youth setup of his local club Seaqaqa F.C. in 2015. That year he was named the best player of the U12 league semi-finals as Seaqaqa defeated Nagroda to advance to the championship. He progressed through the club's ranks, eventually making his Fiji Premier League debut with the senior team. In 2022, he was a key player for Seaqaqa first-team as it advanced deep into the Inter-District Championship (IDC). \nIn February 2023, Raheem transferred to perennial league contenders Ba. He scored the game-winning goal against Labasa to qualify for the semi-finals of the 2023 IDC. In the next match, Raheem scored a hat-trick in the semis en route to Ba eventually winning the championship. He went on to win the tournament's golden boot award as top scorer in the competition. In January 2024, the player confirmed his commitment to the club and announced he would be remaining part of the squad for the 2024 season.\n\n\n== International career ==\nRaheem represented Fiji at the youth level in the 2022 OFC U-19 Championship. He scored against Tonga in a 3–0 victory that propelled Fiji to the knockout rounds. Fiji ultimately won the silver medal in the tournament, falling to New Zealand in the final. Raheem was included in Fiji's squad for the 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup held in Argentina. He went on to appear in all three of his country's matches in the tournament. In preparation for the competition, Raheem was part of the squad that competed in the 2023 PSSI U-20 Mini Tournament in Indonesia in which Fiji would compete against Guatemala, New Zealand and the hosts. In August of that year, Raheem was part of Fiji's national under-23 team that competed in the 2023 OFC Men's Olympic Qualifying Tournament.\nIn October 2023, Raheem was added to the Fiji senior national team squad for the 2023 Pacific Games after an impressive club season. However, he was not part of the final roster because it was too late to make additions to the squad. He went on to make his senior international debut on 18 March 2024 in a friendly away at the Solomon Islands. He scored his first senior international goal in the match, an eventual 1–2 defeat. Three days later, he scored again against the same opponents, this time in a 2–0 victory.\n\n\n=== international goals ===\nScores and results list Tahiti's's goal tally first.\n\n\n=== International statistics ===\nAs of match played 21 March 2024\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMohammed Raheem at National-Football-Teams.com\nMohammed Raheem at Global Sports Archive\nMohammed Raheem at Soccerway",

        "content": "Compañía Española de Minas de Río Tinto (CEMRT) was a Spanish company that operated between 1954 and 1970, mainly in the province of Huelva. Dedicated to mining activities in the Rio Tinto-Nerva basin, over the years the company diversified its business into other sectors. After consolidating its position, in 1970 it merged with another company, giving rise to the Unión Explosivos Río Tinto (ERT) group.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins and creation ===\nSince 1873, the Rio Tinto mines had been under the control of a British-owned company, the Rio Tinto Company Limited (RTC), under whose management they had experienced a great mining and industrial boom. However, from the end of the 1920s, RTC's business declined due to the economic situation of the time, especially after the crash of 1929 and the subsequent arrival of the Second Republic. Some managers began to look to the mines in Africa, especially Rhodesia, which offered much more favourable prospects. After the Civil War, the company's situation in Spain was very complex, due to the hostility of Franco's authorities, the difficulties arising from the Second World War and the plummeting profits. Faced with this situation, the Riotinto mines were considered to be separated from the RTC business. Between 1945 and 1947 there were reunions with the Cros company, but these were not fruitful.\n\nIn June 1954, the Rio Tinto Company Limited began negotiations that would lead to the sale of its assets in Spain in exchange for £7.6 million of pounds and a stake in the new company. Banco Español de Crédito, Banco Hispano Americano and Banco de España were involved in the purchase. Franco's government approved the acquisition shortly afterwards, on 14 August, for which a new company was set up. The acquisition became highly symbolic at the time. For more than eighty years, British control of the Rio Tinto mines had been seen by many as a symbol of the weakness of Spanish capitalism, so the \"Spanishisation\" of the mines by CEMRT was a symbol reflecting the new situation. For the Rio Tinto Company it also had important consequences, as it would mean further diversification of its business in other parts of the world.\nThe Compañía Española de Minas de Río Tinto was officially incorporated on 28 October 1954, with its registered office in Madrid. The businessman Joaquín Benjumea was appointed chairman of the Board of Directors of CEMRT, while General Antonio Torres Espinosa was appointed General Manager.\n\n\n=== Expansion phase ===\nThe new company took over the management of the deposits on 1 January 1955. CEMRT came to control all the installations in Huelva, the railway line, the pier, the country estates and the mining concessions held by RTC throughout Spain. However, the British maintained their presence in Huelva through their technical consultancy services and by developing the commercial activities carried out by CEMRT abroad. After a period of business consolidation, which included a reduction in the workforce, modernisation of machinery and improved productivity, from 1962 onwards the company implemented an expansion strategy that included an industrialisation plan in the Huelva area. In the Riotinto mining basin it had already started the construction of new facilities, such as an ore crushing plant located in the Zarandas-Naya area or a sulfuric acid plant located near Nerva. From 1964 onwards, the company played an important role in the development of the Huelva Chemical Pole, where it installed an electrolytic plant to obtain pure copper.\nAlthough historically Riotinto's ores had been destined for international export, under CEMRT they began to be destined for domestic consumption. During the period between 1954 and 1971, the company was the second largest seller of pyrites in Spain after Compañía de Azufre y Cobre de Tharsis Limitada, with 38.5% of the market share. By then, a large number of mining operations in the province of Huelva had been closed down, so Riotinto was one of the main ones still in operation. Among the company's most important customers were companies such as Cros, Sefanitro, Repesa, Empresa Nacional Calvo Sotelo, Energía e Industrias Aragonesas, Industrial Química de Zaragoza, Abonos Sevilla, etc. CEMRT was also closely linked to the Sociedad Española de Construcciones Electromecánicas, in Córdoba, to which it supplied copper.\n\nFrom 1963, under the presidency of Javier Benjumea Puigcerver, CEMRT embarked on a more expansive strategy, taking advantage of both a favourable economic situation and a privileged situation of aid and tax exemptions from the Franco regime. In line with the company's diversification policy, from 1964 onwards it held talks with foreign copper suppliers in order to meet its new chemical-industrial activities. In 1966, the company Rio Tinto Patiño (RTP) was founded by CEMRT, Rio Tinto-Zinc (RTZ) and the Patiño group. Under the agreement, while RTZ and Patiño undertook to supply copper, CEMRT ceded to RTP the exploitation of the copper porphyry deposits at Cerro Colorado.\nCEMRT was also behind the construction of the La Rábida petrochemical complex, inaugurated in 1967, which was built in collaboration with Gulf Oil.\nThe company maintained its pyrite mining activity in the Riotinto basin, seeking new national customers for this mineral. As a result of this strategy, in 1970, CEMRT merged with Unión Española de Explosivos and became Unión Explosivos Río Tinto.\n\n\n== Archive collections ==\nAt present, the company's documentary collections are in the custody of the Historical Mining Archive of the Río Tinto Foundation.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nArenas Posadas, Carlos (2017). \"Riotinto, el declive de un mito minero (1954-2003)\".

        "earliest_creation_date": "2006-04-05 08:39:53",
        "content": "Turku metropolitan area or Turku region (Finnish: Turun seutu, Swedish: Åbo region) is the metropolitan area around the city of Turku in Finland. The joint municipal authority of the Turku city region (Finnish: Turun kaupunkiseutu, Swedish: Åbo stadsregion) consists of six municipalities: Turku, Kaarina, Lieto, Naantali, Raisio and Rusko. The Turku metropolitan area forms a compact, urban-like regional growth centre where people commute from a relatively large area of the Southwest Finland region.\nThe Turku metropolitan area has a population of about 311,000, making it the third largest region in Finland after Helsinki and Tampere. The terms Turku metropolitan area, Turku region, Turku city region, Greater Turku and the other terms used are not fixed and may vary in different contexts.\nTurku metropolitan area differs from the Turku sub-region (Finnish: Turun seutukunta), which also includes the municipalities of Masku, Mynämäki, Nousiainen, Paimio and Sauvo. The Turku sub-region is used for statistical purposes. It is based on cooperation between municipalities and the commuting area. The sub-region has a population of about 347,000.\nTurku metropolitan area has two universities and three universities of applied sciences. Finland's largest bio-industrial cluster of research and companies is located in Turku. There are also ICT concentrations in the cities of Turku and Salo. The Turku metropolitan area is located on the Baltic Sea coast with its logistical activities. The region's two seaports, the Port of Turku and the Port of Naantali, and the shipbuilding industry are major employers in the area. Turku Airport has logistics industries for sea, air, rail and road freight.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Turku region is located in the southwestern corner of Finland around the city of Turku. It is part of the region of Southwest Finland and Western Finland. It is bordered by the Salo sub-region to the east, the Loimaa sub-region to the northeast, Vakka-Suomi to the north and Åboland to the southwest. The Turku region has part of the Archipelago Sea with its various islands to the southwest.\nThe Turku city region consists of four major cities. Turku in the centre, Naantali and Raisio in the west and Kaarina in the east. The coastline is occupied by two seaports, one of Naantali and one of Turku. All four cities are connected to the Turku Ring Road and the Kaarinantie road. There are also connections to the E18 and E63 motorways and national roads 1, 8, 9 and 10. Turku Airport is located north of the city and the ring road, and its area is partly shared between Rusko and Turku. Northeast of the airport, the city region ends and the Finnish interior with its forests and countryside begins.\nAs a large part of the region lies in the Archipelago Sea, there are several islands in the area and some of the municipalities, such as Rymättylä, are entirely on islands. The Turku city region has some of the most notable islands in the Archipelago Sea, such as Luonnonmaa in Naantali, Hirvensalo, Kakskerta and Ruissalo in Turku, and Kuusisto in Kaarina. The islands are not very populated, except for Hirvensalo in Turku, which is very close to the city centre. Most of the islands are covered by forests, but there are also fields close to the mainland.\n\nMost of the water in the Turku region is concentrated in the Archipelago Sea, but there are also several lakes and reservoirs, some of which are located on the islands. The sea is mostly narrow straits between islands. Most of the water is quite shallow, but the main sea routes can be used by the world's largest cruise ships, some of which are built at the Turku shipyard.\nThe mainland is full of small hills, valleys and river valleys. The hills are often rocky, like the islands of the archipelago, and in fact these hills used to be part of the archipelago just after the Ice Age, but they rose from the sea and were connected to the mainland. Some of the hills were used as watchtowers in the days of the Vikings, who raided villages along the Baltic Sea. When the sentries spotted the Vikings, they would light an alarm fire on the top of the hill so that other sentry hills in the row would see it and light their own fire. One of these hills is Vartiovuori in Turku, which actually means \"Guardian Hill\". The river valleys have always been places of settlement, safe from the open sea and yet close and connected to it. When the valleys aren't inhabited, they are usually occupied by grain fields.\n\n\n== Urbanization ==\n\nThe majority of the population of the Turku metropolitan area lives within the ring roads. The population density is quite high. Outside the city region, the population density drops sharply and urbanisation is more concentrated and surrounded by the countryside. Although the Turku metropolitan area as a whole has a low population density, it is worth noting that there are large unpopulated areas within the city limits, where activity and population are actually more concentrated. These more densely populated areas do not only exist in Turku, but also in four cities from Naantali to Kaarina. \nThe heart of the region is the Market Square in the centre of Turku. The city centre is quite small and concentrated, comprising only 4 to 5 km2 blocks. Small and sprawling neighbourhoods surrounding the city centre were built around the 50s and 60s, along with more modern buildings. Further away from the city centre (about 5 to 10 km) are the larger suburbs and neighbourhoods, which may have their own centres. There are also several large shopping centres.\nThe bus network is the only form of public transport in the Turku city region, although there have been discussions and preliminary decisions about reinstating a light rail system in the 2030s.\n\n\n== Municipalities ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nHelsinki metropolitan area\nTampere metropolitan area\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTurun seutu",

        "content": "The Korps Pandoeren, or Corps Pandoeren, was a light infantry unit raised  in the Cape Colony from the Khoekhoe and mixed population to aid in the colony's defence. The unite was raised in 1793 following France's declaration of war with the Netherlands at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. The unit was disbanded by the British following the capture of the Cape Colony in 1806. The unit saw action during the Invasion of the Cape Colony in 1795 and the Battle of Blaauwberg in 1806.  The corps was noted for its skill in fighting unconventional actions.  \nDuring the British administration of the Cape Colony the unit would be reconstituted into a British line regiment, the Cape Corps, initially based at Rietvlei just outside of Cape Town, disbanded in 1870 then reformed in 1915 until disbandment again in 1991.\nThe name \"Pandoeren\" was derived from the Hungarian “pandur” light infantry founded 46 years before.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is best known for the title track, which the group initially recorded and released as a single (Mira 207) in late 1965. Not satisfied with the sound, the group recorded a second version in early 1966. After Bobby Arlin replaced original guitarist Bill Rinehart, the group recorded and released a third version as a single (Mira 222) in May 1966.  This is the widely-recognized version of the song.\nThe Leaves recording of \"Hey Joe\" was the first version of the song to have mainstream success. The song gained further notoriety when the Jimi Hendrix Experience recorded it as their first single in the fall of 1966. The Leaves' version was also part of the 1972 compilation album Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965–1968.\nThe original album was issued in both mono and stereo. It was reissued on CD, first in 1993 on One Way Records (with five bonus tracks) and again in 2000 on the Sundazed label (with seven bonus tracks).\nThe \"Hey Joe\" single (Mira 222) lists Dino Valenti as the composer, while the LP label credits Chester Powers (Valenti's given name).\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n=== Side 1 ===\n\"Dr. Stone\" (Beck, Pons) - 2:20\n\"Just A Memory\" (Arlin) - 2:17\n\"Get Out of My Life, Woman\" (Allen Toussaint) - 2:45\n\"Girl From The East\" (R.P.

        "content": "The Governor's House (Ukrainian: Будинок губернатора, romanized: Budynok hubernatora) is a 19th century historical building in the city of Dnipro, Ukraine. The name \"Governor's House\" originated when the central treasury bought the building at the intersection of Voskresenska Street and Ekaterininsky Prospekt in order to move the governor of Yekaterinoslav and his office there in 1887. It is home to the Museum of Dnipro City History since 2020.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe structure is a two-story building with a mezzanine in the center, and was designed using neo-Gothic architectural features inside and out. The L-shaped home is primarily two stories with a centrally expanded three stories made of brick and plaster. The second floor's windows are pointed, while the first floor's windows are ring-shaped. Iron castings, fireplaces, and marble finishes have all been retained within.There was a yard on the side of the road within the estate. Along the avenue, a sizable garden was constructed; the area was used as a park until the late 1970s. The major was given permission to build a stone fence and add on to the house's stone wing in March 1860. A one-story service building was constructed in 1901 on Voskresenska Street to house the governor's guard.The building's second-floor stained glass window, cornice profiles, and décor was restored during the 2021 rebuild. The building's original painting's hues and missing décor pieces will also be restored. The building's renovated facade will be lit up.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt is one of the earliest homes in Dnipropetrovsk was constructed in 1830 (although some sources place the year of construction at 1850), as the house of Major Grigory Ivanovich Shcherbakov. He was in charge of the provincial excise administration and had the funds to construct a two-story structure. Despite this, the building was leased to the English Club for a while in 1850. The leasing rate of the buildings has grown from 4.5 thousand to 5.5 thousand rubles per year in tandem with the expansion of the English Club. Additionally, the governor started to view the housing issue as an important matter.The approval of the Katerynoslav Governor's petition to buy the building was given, and on 26 May 1887, Emperor Alexander III approved the decision to buy a home was granted; it now belonged to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The parcel of land with the buildings cost 65 thousand rubles, and an extra 60 thousand had to be paid for repairs and building new space. It should be remembered that the development and repair plans were not carried out in their entirety. Thirteen governors presented their work at the Governor's House.The subject of whether a new facility is necessary was brought up by the province's bureaucratic apparatus's unceasing expansion. Simultaneously, there were plans to sell the residence. The Governor's House with a piece of land and auxiliary buildings cost 408,094 rubles in 1914. However, the start of World War I caused some revisions, and the decision to sell and construct a new structure was put off. There were many developments throughout the tumultuous following years. Here was the interim regional commissar's office, and then the German military command.\nThis building had a slew of renamings following the October Revolution, with different owners taking it for over fifty years. It was known as Ekaterinoslav Smolny during the revolution since here was the location of the Council of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies in December 1917. Because of this, the structure was placed under governmental protection as a historical monument. The provincial executive committee held this position from 1919 to 1934, when it was replaced by the Teacher's House, the House of Pioneers, the DOSAAF committee, the statistics department, the organization of young ensembles and discos, and the design institute.The House of Enlightenment occupied the building in 1926; in 1929, it was home to the House of Scientists, the House of Education Workers, the Consulting Reference Bureau, and the police district reserve for horses. The House of Education Workers was founded there in 1931, followed by the House of Scientists of Workers and Dnipromyskkomundivision in 1932.The building later housed the Dnipropetrovsk City House of Pioneers on 1 May 1934. The home turned become a popular destination for citywide schoolchildren. This place was home to several kid-focused amateur art and technological creative organizations. A two-story addition was built on the right side of the avenue to accommodate the House of Pioneers, but was demolished in the early 1980s.During the Great Patriotic War, the building came under shelling in August and September of 1941. Repairs to restore it started in January 1942 and finished in March of the same year. The residence has served a visiting house since 1942. The buildings on the site's northwest and south-western borders were demolished during the fighting for the city's liberation. The main building and the one-story structure that is linked to it on the street side did not sustain any serious damages. 1950 saw improvements made to the area and repairs made to the buildings.A proposal to rebuild the park and complete a new structure was planned in 1962. A three-story structure at the end of Leninska Street was placed into use in August 1964. Concurrently, the 1901 erected one-story building was demolished while under the guardianship of the governor. The organization has been known as the Zoe Kosmodemyanska Schoolchildren and Pioneers Palace since 1965. The land on which the new Victory movie theater was to be built was suggested in 1968, but the project was never carried out. The building housed the Central Design Bureau of Local Industry of the USSR, the Design Department II, the Palace of Pioneers, the Method Cabinet of the City Department of Public Education, and several others in 1971.The structure was designated as a republican-significant architectural monument in 1979. The home was abandoned from 1983 to 1997, without anyone living there, without lights or heat, and, worst of all, without locks. After a considerable amount of time, the municipal authorities could no longer stand the presence of rats and illnesses in the city center and soon started discussing the necessity of demolishing the structure. However, luckily, the building's historical significance was preserved by the intellectuals in the area.The building saw new plans by the end of 1990. Subsequently, Dnepropetrovsk utilities took responsibility for the building since it was intended to house a Museum of Communal Services. But this proposal never materialized, and the home lay abandoned for a while until PrivatBank took an interest in it in 1997. They completed restoration of the building in 1998, and changed to its previous name, the Governor's House.The building's front is scheduled to be rebuilt for 16 million hryvnias, and architects have already finished developing the concept. This announcement was made on 27 August 2021 with work expected to begin at the end of September 2021. The Governor's House hosted the creation of the first phase of the Museum of Dnipro City History's exhibition in 2020, and second phase in 2021. The museum introduced interactive exhibit covers a wide range of topics, including the sociocultural life of the city, the history of commerce and banking in the area, and the origins and growth of the city in the 18th and 20th centuries.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

It is one of the predecessors of today's University of Tokyo.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nTraditionally, astronomical studies and revision of the calendar were carried out by the Onmyo-no-tsukasa (陰陽寮), which was established by Emperor Tenmu in the 7th century. The institute was established in 1684 when the Tokugawa Shogunate decided to switch from the Senmyō calendar, which had been in use for 823 years and had thus accumulated significant errors, to the newly invented Jōkyō calendar. The inventor of the calendar, Harumi Shibukawa, was appointed as the head of the institute.\nThe institute was also responsible for surveying, chorography, and translating European academic books and papers. The translation department (蛮書和解御用, Bansho Wagegoyo) eventually spun off to form the Bansho Shirabesho, one of the predecessors of humanities studies at the University of Tokyo.\n\nThe eighth shogun Yoshimune invested heavily in this institute to absorb European modern natural science, resulting in an accumulation of distinguished scholars, imported materials and equipments. The Kansei Calendar was developed by Yoshitoki Takahashi in 1798, which took into account the elliptical orbits of the sun and moon. His student Tadataka Ino and he completed the first comprehensive modern map of Japan in 1821.\nThe office of chief astronomer was officially hereditary, but often, outstanding astronomers were adopted, making it meritocratic in practice.\nAfter the Meiji Restoration, it became one of the direct predecessors of sciences studies at the University of Tokyo.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was intended for \"Ögonen\" to be a song that was \"sexy, from a mature woman's perspective\". The final version of the lyrics was about the intimacy and sensuality of a couple which related to Frida's relationship with her husband Heinrich Ruzzo Prinz Reuss von Plauen.\nThe single was released in October 1996, with two remixes: one was the \"Ögonen (Lemon Mix)\" by John Amatiello and Martin Pihl and another, titled \"Ögonen (Version)\" by Glenmark. Glenmark had originally asked Soundfactory to produce remixes for the songs on the album but due to their unavailability, this resulted in Glenmark producing the latter remix. \"Ögonen\" spent one week in the Swedish charts, reaching No. 24.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nCD single\n\n\"Ögonen (Album)\" - 4:18\n\"Ögonen (Lemon mix)\" - 4:34\n\"Ögonen (Version)\" - 4:23\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

The temple commemorates their meeting and represents themes of duty, valor, and familial bonds in the lore of Hanuman.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe temple architecture embodies typical elements of Gujarati design but is notably simplistic, focusing on the sanctity of the idols rather than ornate embellishment.\n\n\n== Pilgrimage ==\nHanuman Dandi Temple is a significant pilgrimage site, attracting devotees who come to pay homage to Hanuman and explore the unique father-son relationship depicted between Hanuman and Makardhwaj.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nDwarkadhish Temple\nBet Dwarka\nShivrajpur beach\nSudarshan Setu",

        "content": "Grigor Khaghbakian (died in 1220–1223) was a Prince of the Armenian Khaghbakian family in the province of Zakarid Armenia, Kingdom of Georgia. Together with his wife Zaz, he built the Surp Stepanos church at Aghjots Vank in 1217.\nGrigor Khaghbakian is also known for a 1233 khatchkar with a sacred image, now in Etchmiadzin Cathedral, where it was brought from Imirzek.\nThe 13th century Armenian historian Kirakos Gandzaketsi reports that some time after a 1220 Mongol incursion under Subutai, the Kipchaks came to the Armenian city of Gandzak between 1220 and 1223, where they encountered the troops of King Lasha of Georgia and his atabeg Ivane. Although the Georgians ultimately prevailed, Grigor Khaghbakian was captured and tortured to death by the Kipchak Turks:\n\n[The Qipchags] seized, among others, Grigor (son of Haghbak, brother of brave Vasak) and his brother's son Papak'; for Vasak had three sons: Papak', Mkdem, and Hasan (called Prhosh), brave and distinguished men who had caused all the Tachik troops to quake with fear. They killed Papak' in battle. As for Grigor, they arrested him and tormented him with numerous tortures to make him deny Christ, but he did not do so. On the contrary, he insulted their deceiving law-giver Mahmet and their loathsome faith even more. [Grigor's captors] grew angry and dragged him naked over the earth and lacerated his entire body with thorns and so tortured him that he gave up the ghost because of the beatings, receiving a martyr's crown from Christ. These men were from Xach'en district of a prominent family, Christians, orthodox, and of Armenian nationality. The impious Iranians oppressed many other captives with various tortures, keeping them hungry, thirsty, and \nnaked.\nGrigor Khaghbakian was son of Haghbak, brother of Vasak Khaghbakian, and uncle of Prosh Khaghbakian, founder of the Proshyan dynasty.\nThe Khachqar cross dedicated by Grigor Khaghbakian in 1233, now located near Etchmiadzin Cathedral, is considered as one of the finest, with its detailed and refined openwork sculpture. A fine Deesis decorated the entablature, and the donator appears on horse at the bottom, a rare occurrence as such crosses are not often decorated with human depictions. \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Florence Mills Brown  CBE (28 November 1898 – 6 March 1981) was Lord Mayor of Bristol in 1963–64. Brown was the first woman to be Lord Mayor of Bristol.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nFlorence Mills Burgess was born in Bristol in 1898, the daughter of Frank & Florence Burgess. Brown was a tobacco stripper at the Wills tobacco factory in Bedminster, where she was also shop steward.\n\n\n== Councillor, Alderman and Lord Mayor ==\nBrown was a Labour candidate in St Augustine Ward in November 1936, narrowly losing to the incumbent Citizen candidate, Robert Lyne. She stood again in a by-election in Ss Philip and Jacob South Ward in February 1937.\nBrown was elected unopposed for Ss Philip and Jacob South Ward in November 1937. She became an Alderman in 1955. She was Lord Mayor in 1963–64. She returned to being a councillor, retiring when she lost her seat on Cabot Ward in 1973.\nShe was awarded the CBE in 1966.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBrown married Frederick Hanson Brown (1897–1975) at St Augustine the Less, Bristol in 1923. She died in 1981, aged 82.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nFlorence Brown Special Needs School in Knowle West was named after her; it existed from 1969 to 2010. The school was named for her as Brown was active in disabled charities: she was the chair of Bristol Action Research for the Crippled Child.\nIn 2022 it was announced that a road would be named after Brown on the Imperial Park development in Bishopsworth on the former Imperial Tobacco site. It had originally been proposed to call the road Navy Cut, after an Imperial Tobacco product, but Marvin Rees, the elected Mayor of Bristol, vetoed the proposal.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The ancien séminaire Saint-Sulpice is a building in Paris, France. It is listed as a monument historique, located on Place Saint-Sulpice in the 6th arrondissement of Paris. It was constructed from 1820 to 1838 for the Seminary of Saint-Sulpice, which occupied it until 1906. Since 1922 is has been used by the French Ministry of Finance.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nA new seminary financed two-thirds by the State, one-third by the city, was rebuilt to the south of the square from 1820 to 1838 on the plans of the City architect Étienne-Hippolyte Godde for the Society of the Priests of Saint Sulpicereestablished by Louis XVIII on April 3, 1816. This building was built partly on land belonging to the former seminary enlarged by the expropriation of houses on rue du Pot-de-Fer, current rue Bonaparte and rue Férou.\nThe 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State led to the evacuation in December 1906 of the seminary which was assigned to the Fine Arts administration to create a museum of living artists which was not built. The building, used to accommodate victims of the 1910 Great Flood of Paris and then to accommodate refugees and soldiers on leave from World War I, was assigned in 1922 to the Ministry of Finance. A project of restitution to the Company of Priests of Saint-Sulpice was abandoned in 1924.: 347 \n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe building includes four buildings, ground floor and three floors, inspired by Italian palaces, with a massive and austere appearance, around an interior courtyard forming a cloister. A chapel dedicated to the Virgin with stained glass windows and a coffered ceiling, located perpendicular to the southern body of the building (opposite the facade on the square), is an administrative premises that is not accessible.: 347 \n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of monuments historiques in Paris\nJean-Jacques Olier\nSaint-Sulpice Seminary (France)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nCarbon, Jean-Louis (1999).

It is yellowish-white. It contains six whorls. The protoconch consists of one whorl. The immersed apex is convex, quite smooth, and ends abruptly in an oblique retrocurrent scar. The whorls of the spire are roundly shouldered immediately below the suture, then convexly sloping. The suture is deeply narrowly channelled. The body whorl is roundly-obliquely cylindrical. The aperture is obliquely arcuately  pyriform. The outer lip is simple, smooth inside, finely-crinkled outside and very slightly compressed above its centre. The basal lip is well-rounded, its inner half distinctly everted. The columella has a wide, simple oblique fold just below the base of the body whorl, over which the thin inner lip is applied to join the labrum at the suture.  The umbilicus is small.\nThere are six spiral incisions in the penultimate whorl, forty in the body whorl, extending to the columella, where they become crowded and fine. Very delicate, close-set, axial striae cross the incisions, which they punctate, climb, and crenulate their sides, and traverse the intervening fiat spiral bands. \n\n\n== Distribution ==\n\nThis marine species is endemic to Australia and lives in offshore waters off South Australia Tasmania and Victoria at depths between 150 m and 200 m.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nCotton, B.C. & Godfrey, F.K. 1932.

It is endemic to northeastern Vietnam and to China's Guizhou, Guangxi, and Guangdong. It also lives in the mountains on Hainan Island. This frog has been observed between 630 and 710 meters above sea level.\nThis frog lives in evergreen forests, bamboo forests, mixed forests, and scrubby areas. This frog breeds through larval development in shallow pools.\nScientists classify this frog as at least concern of extinction because of its large range. However, it does face some threat from deforestation associated with small farms. This frog is occasionally harvested as food and as a component in traditional medicines.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Abantennarius is a genus of marine ray-finned fishes belonging to the family Antennariidae, the frogfishes. The fishes in the genus are found in the Indian, Pacific and, one species, in the Western Atlantic Oceans.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nAbantennarius was first proposed as a genus in 1957 by the American ichthyologist Leonard Peter Schultz with Antennarius duescus designated as the type species.A. duescus has originally been described in 1904 by John Otterbein Snyder with its type locality given as between Maui and Lanai in the Hawaiian Islands. This genus has been regarded as a synonym of Antennarius, but is now regarded as valid genus. Some authorities classify this genus in the subfamily Antennariinae within the family Antennariidae. However, the 5th edition of Fishes of the World does not recognise subfamilies within the Antennariidae, classifying the family within the suborder Antennarioidei within the order Lophiiformes, the anglerfishes.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nAbantennarius prefixes ab, meaning \"away from\", onto antennarius, a fish of the family Antennaridae. This is an allusion to the gill opening being positioned away from the base of the pectoral fin, which is typically where it is located in frogfishes.\n\n\n== Species ==\nAbantennarius contains the following recognised species:\n\nAbantennarius analis (Schultz, 1957) (Tailjet frogfish)\nAbantennarius bermudensis (Schultz, 1957) (Island frogfish)\nAbantennarius coccineus (Lesson, 1831) (Scarlet frogfish)\nAbantennarius dorehensis (Bleeker, 1859) (New Guinean frogfish)\nAbantennarius drombus (D. S. Jordan & Evermann, 1903) (Freckled frogfish)\nAbantennarius duescus (Snyder, 1904) (Side-jet frogfish)\nAbantennarius nummifer (Cuvier, 1817) (Spotfin frogfish)\nAbantennarius rosaceus (H. M. Smith & Radcliffe, 1912) (Spint-tufted frogfish)\nAbantennarius sanguineus (Gill, 1863) (Bloody frogfish)\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nAbantennarius frogfishes have round, nearly globular bodies that are to some degree compressed. They do not have spines on the illicium and the esca is very small or absent. The second dorsa spinenis not connected to the head by a membrane while the third dorsal spine may be flexible or immobile. The mouth is upward pointing and is very large. The pectoral fins have developed to resemble limbs and have an \"elbow\", the fin is widely linked to the body. The gill opening is small and round, under and to the rear of the base of the pectoral fin. There is no caudal peduncle and the rear edges of the dorsal fin and anal fin are connected to the caudal fin by membranes. The rays in the caudal fin may be branched. The body is covered in thick skin which is covered in dense, closely set spinules, They typically have a dark blotch covering part of the upper body and the base of the dorsal fin. The smallest species in the genus is A. duescus, with a maximum published standard length of 3 cm (1.2 in), while the largest is A. dorehensis with a maximum published total length is 14 cm (5.5 in).\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nAbantennarius frogfishes are found in the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean from the eastern coasts of Africa east to the western coasts of the Americas, with one species A. bermudensis in the western Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Canada–India diplomatic row refers to the diplomatic dispute in the Canada–India relations caused in September 2023. India's alleged role in the assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June 2023 created a diplomatic crisis between Canada and India. While the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations that the Indian government was involved in the assassination of Nijjar triggered this diplomatic row, the tensions between India and Canada have been largely fuelled by disagreements over the Sikh separatist Khalistan movement and its active supporters.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nCanada has the largest Sikh population outside India.\nIn March 2023, Canada's High Commissioner was summoned by India to \"convey strong concern\" over Sikh protesters in Canada and the security breach of India's diplomatic mission and consulates.\nIn September 2023, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in New Delhi, the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi conveyed concerns about the protests in Canada to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\nIn 2023, Canada paused talks on a proposed trade treaty with India. In September 2023, Canada announced it has postponed an October trade mission to India.\nOn 18 September 2023, Prime Minister Trudeau addressing the House of Commons said that \"Over the past number of weeks, Canadian security agencies have been actively pursuing credible allegations of a potential link between agents of the government of India and the killing of a Canadian citizen, Hardeep Singh Nijjar\". Trudeau stated that he had presented the accusations directly to Prime Minister Modi \"in no uncertain terms\" during the G20 summit in New Delhi. Trudeau further added that \"Any involvement of a foreign government in the killing of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil is an unacceptable violation of our sovereignty\" while urging the Indian government to cooperate in the ongoing investigation.\nIndian Ministry of External Affairs rejected Trudeau's allegations in a statement saying that claims of India's \"involvement in any act of violence in Canada are absurd and motivated\". It added that similar accusations made earlier by Trudeau to Prime Minister Modi had been \"completely rejected\". The statement further said that \"Such unsubstantiated allegations seek to shift the focus from Khalistani terrorists and extremists, who have been provided shelter in Canada and continue to threaten India's sovereignty and territorial integrity\". India urged Canada \"to take prompt and effective legal action against all anti-India elements operating from their soil\". It said that Canada's inaction has been \"a long-standing and continuing concern\".\n\n\n== Diplomatic row ==\nOn 18 September 2023, Canadian foreign affairs minister Melanie Joly announced that Canada had expelled 'Pavan Kumar Rai' — a \"senior Indian diplomat\". According to Joly, Pavan Kumar Rai was the head of the Canada station of India's foreign intelligence agency — the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW). The High Commission of India in Ottawa lists Rai as the minister responsible for \"eco, coordination, community affairs\".\nIn her statement, Joly said that Canada \"will not tolerate any form of foreign interference\". She added that such action \"is not only troubling but it is completely unacceptable\". She further said that India's involvement if proven true would be \"a great violation of our sovereignty and of the most basic rule of how countries deal with each other\".\nOn 19 September 2023, India expelled a top diplomat of Canada with five days' notice to leave the country amid \"growing concern at the interference of Canadian diplomats\" in India's \"internal matters and their involvement in anti-India activities\", according to a statement from Indian Ministry of External Affairs.\nOn 20 September 2023, India warned its citizens due to \"growing anti-India activities and politically-condoned hate crimes and criminal violence\" to \"exercise utmost caution\" in Canada. Dominic LeBlanc, Canadian public safety minister, responded to the travel alert saying \"Canada is a safe country\".\nOn 21 September 2023, Indian external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi announced that India has suspended \"temporarily the issuance of visas or providing visa services\" for all Canadian nationals in all categories, including e-visas and for Canadian citizens applying from third countries, due to \"security threats\" against its diplomats.\nOn 24 September 2023, Canada updated its travel advisory for India, advising its citizens there to \"remain vigilant and exercise caution\" due to \"calls for protests and some negative sentiment towards Canada on social media\". It urges travellers to \"exercise a high degree of caution in India due to the threat of terrorist attacks throughout the country\".\nIn early October, India asked Canada to withdraw 41 of its 62 diplomats from the country and threatened to revoke the diplomatic immunity of diplomats who would remain after a certain date. On 18 October 2023, 41 Canadian diplomats along with 42 of their family members left India. Mélanie Joly, the Canadian foreign minister, said that Canada will temporarily close three consulates in India and concentrate services at its high commission in Delhi, with 21 diplomats remaining in India. Canada's immigration minister, Marc Miller said that the situation would cause delays in the immigration applications and processing of visas for people in India.\nOn 20 October 2023, India's Ministry of External Affairs issued a statement stating that \"Their continued interference in our internal affairs warrant a parity in mutual diplomatic presence in New Delhi and Ottawa\".\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nA spokesperson for Australia's Foreign Minister, Penny Wong, stated that “Australia is deeply concerned by these allegations and notes ongoing investigations into this matter. Australia believes all countries should respect sovereignty and the rule of law”.\nA spokesperson for the United Kingdom's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said that they \"do not agree with the decisions taken by the Indian government that have resulted in a number of Canadian diplomats departing India\". The statement added that they \"continue to encourage India to engage with Canada on its independent investigation into the death of Hardeep Singh Nijjar\".\nThe United States Department of State spokesperson Matthew Miller said that they \"urged the Indian government not to insist upon a reduction in Canada's diplomatic presence and to cooperate in the ongoing Canadian investigation\".\nThe New Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed concern in a statement saying “Now seems the time for more diplomacy, not less,” adding that it expects \"all states to uphold their obligations under the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, including in relation to the privileges and immunities of accredited staff”.\nAccording to Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center think-tank, \"this may be the lowest level to which this relationship has sunk. It won't be easy to return to the old normal anytime soon\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nAssassination of Kim Jong-nam\nAssassination of Jamal Khashoggi\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"PM Trudeau | 'Credible allegations' that India was involved in killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar\".

        "content": "Elizabeth Bunnell Read (pen name, Lizzie B. Read; 1832–1909) was an American journalist and woman suffragist. Between 1861 and 1865, in Indiana, Read published The Mayflower, the only suffrage paper published during the American Civil War. She served as President of the Iowa Woman's Suffrage Society.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nElizabeth Currence Bunnell was born on a farm in Dewitt township, near Syracuse, New York, on December 24, 1834, the fifth child in a family of four boys and five girls. Her father, Edmund Harger Bunnell, was born in Connecticut, the son of Nathan Bunnell and Currence Twitchell, his wife. Her mother was Betsey Ann Ashley, daughter of Dr. John Ashley, of Catskill, New York, and his wife Elizabeth Johnstone, of the Johnstones of colonial era. Her paternal grandfather was a soldier of the War of 1812, and his father participated in the American Revolutionary War. One of her brothers, Nathan Bunnell, a soldier in the Union Army died in 1862 during the civil war. When Elizabeth was fourteen years old, her parents removed from New York to Indiana, where, within six weeks after their arrival, her mother died. Business ventures proved unfortunate, and the family circle was soon broken.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBefore she was 16, Miss Bunnell began to teach school.\nShe began writing for the press when about 20, and continued as a contributor to several different journals. Having an opportunity to learn the printing business, she did so, and found the occupation pleasant, though it required a lot of effort. She served an apprenticeship of two years, and then accepted the position of foreman of a weekly paper and job office in Peru, Indiana, filling the ost for four years.\nAt the end of that time, in January 1861, she began publishing a semi-monthly journal called The Mayflower, devoted to literature, temperance and equal rights. That paper had a subscription list reaching into all the U.S. States and Territories.\nOn March 4, 1863, she married Dr. Samuel George Alexander Read (1814–1893). In 1865, the couple removed to Algona, Iowa. There she published 37 issues of a weekly county paper, The Upper Des Moines, representing the interests of the upper Des Moines valley, which at that time had no other newspaper.\n\nA series of articles in the Northwestern Christian Advocate in 1872, on the status of women in the Methodist Episcopal Church (MEC), led to their more just recognition in subsequent episcopal addresses.\nBy 1893, with Carrie Chapman Catt and Evelyn M. Russell, Read served as co-editor of the Woman's Standard, of Des Moines, Iowa, a monthly newspaper produced by the Iowa Woman Suffrage Association devoted to equal rights, temperance and literature. She was vice-president of the Indiana State Woman Suffrage Society, while residing there, and later served as president of the Iowa Woman's Suffrage Society. In May 1897, from Elkins, Arkansas, Read wrote a letter to the suffragists who gathered in Algona, Iowa giving her support for a campaign to bring the woman's suffrage to the State.\nRead was deeply interested in all social and moral problems. The unfortunate and criminal classes enlisted her sympathy and attention. She was one of the original members and promoters of the Woman's Congress. She lectured occasionally on temperance, education and suffrage. She was generally known in literature as Mrs. Lizzie B. Read.\nIn church membership, Read was Methodist. In 1899, Read donated US$500 to the newly built Methodist Episcopal Church in Algona, noting that one of the big windows was to be made into a memorial for her husband. He was the first president of the trustees of the first church, and for over a year, all the Methodist meetings were held in their home. The Methodist church and The Upper Des Moines newspaper were both housed at their home at the same time.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn June 1885, Read went to Salt Lake City, Utah to recuperate from over-work.\nFor some years before the turn of the century, she made her home in the Ozarks of Arkansas. Elizabeth Bunnell Read died in Fayetteville, Arkansas, May 22, 1909, and is interred in Riverview Cemetery in Algona, Iowa.\n\nA note in the May 26, 1909 edition of the Upper Des Moines Republican stated:— \"She was an ardent advocate of the ballot for woman at a time when the notion was much more unpopular than it is now. While not apparently a woman of a wide range of sympathies, she was a woman of intellectual vigor and was fearless and aggressive.\"\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nIowa State Honor Roll of the National League of Women Voters\n2022, \"Votes For Women\" historical marker erected in Peru, Indiana, honoring Lizzie Bunnell\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Works related to Woman of the Century/Elizabeth C.

        "content": "Fighter is the soundtrack album, composed by Vishal-Shekhar to the 2024 Hindi film of the same name, directed by Siddharth Anand that casts Hrithik Roshan, Deepika Padukone and Anil Kapoor in lead roles. The original score to the film was written by Sanchit Balhara and Ankit Balhara. The film was produced by Viacom18 Studios and Marflix Pictures.\nThe soundtrack album has two distinct sounds - one featured group of pilots in the air force whereas the other brings the theme of patriotism, heartbreak, loss, beauty and courage of the fighter pilots. The tracks \"Sher Khul Gaye\", \"Ishq Jaisa Kuch\" and \"Heer Aasmani\" served as the lead singles. Majority of the tunes for the original songs were composed within a week's time. The song \"Bekaar Dil\" was available for digital downloads after the theatrical release of the film as it was removed by the CFBC, India.\nThe music received mixed reviews, critics pointing out their awkward placement in the film run, unusual lyrics and the original score lacking cinematic appeal, However, they praised the tracks, calling it energetic, pacy and romantic. The track \"Sher Khul Gaye\", a party number and created the record for reaching 50 million views, within 24 hours of its release on YouTube. The music album consists of six original songs, with lyrics written by Kumaar. \"Fighter Theme\" and \"Spirit of Fighter\" are theme songs whereas Vande Mataram was alluded as the film's anthem song. The track \"Spirit of Fighter\" was featured in the film's teaser. The song \"Mitti\" has a version sung by Suresh Wadkar.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAs per Vishal Dadlani majority of the tunes were composed within a week of the film script narration. He cited that the project's 'natural energy' added to their creative process. In an interview Asian Variety TV Network, after Fighter's narration, they started making music on the spot. Knowing the Roshan would be starring in the film, they subconsciously started to design dance tunes. In an interview with DNA India Shekhar Ravjiani said that they kept music of Fighter quite edgy - a combination of electro and dance but the tunes as desi and floaty as possible. In an interview with Asian Sunday, Dadlani said the soundtrack has two distinct types of sound, one, the music of camaraderie of the group of pilots in the air force academy, in the air, initially while training. The rest are based on depth - emotions of patriotism, heartbreak, loss, beauty and courage, truth of the fighter pilots.\"Sher Khul Gaye\", is a party track which was featured on group of pilots who were celebrating a milestone. As per Dadlani and Ravjiani, the track instills the spirit of pilots being 'the kings (metaphorically, tigers) of the world'. Director Siddharth Anand acknowledged that the notes, scanning and progressions of \"Sher Khul Gaye\" were similar to 1977 single Stayin' Alive, neither inspired nor plagiarized. While writing two deep soul tracks (\"Mitti\" and \"Dil Banaane Waaleya\"), singer KK was the first choice for the vocals. However, they could not record him due to his untimely demise.In an interview with Hindustan Times, Anand cited that the theme of \"Heer Aasmani\" is an air force pilot expressing their unconditional love for the skies. He went on to add that it was modern in presentation and features guitar riffs and rustic vocals by singer B Praak. The track was dedicated to the special squad of Air Dragons coming together. It showcases the crew bonding, both during briefing and training sessions as well as during their downtime. The track \"Mitti\" was a patriotic, featured at a point in the film where the team of fighters suffer a loss.The track \"Spirit of Fighter\" was written for the background score of the film and had been featured in the teaser. The songs \"Ishq Jaisa Kuch\" and \"Bekaar Dil\" were removed from the film footage as they were deemed 'explicit' for Indian audience. However, the former one was added in the end credits of Indian theatrical prints whereas both the tracks were present in the international prints.\n\n\n== Music videos ==\nThe song \"Sher Khul Gaye\" was released as the first single from the film on December 15, 2023. The song was a party number and created the record for reaching 50 million views, within 24 hours on YouTube. It drew comparisons with song \"Stayin' Alive\" by Bee Gees and \"Dynamite\" by BTS. Padukone wears a polka dotted black dress and matches to the dance steps by Roshan. Anil Kapoor makes a grand entry. The song was choreographed by Bosco and Caesar. The second single from the soundtrack was \"Ishq Jaisa Kuch\" that was released on December 22, 2023. The song begins with Roshan walking from sea bare-chested with Padukone donning a black monokini. Later in the song, the leading duo wore beach and party-ready fits, Padukone in a gold and silver embellished mini skirt and bralette-style top by Paco Rabanne. The third single was \"Heer Aasmani\" that was released on January 15, 2024. The crew filmed the song in snowy regions of Jammu and Kashmir. The characters were facing difficulty in syncing lip movements under freezing temperatures.\n\n\n== Critical response ==\nReviewing for The Guardian, Phuong Lee criticized the tracks and their picturization, calling out: \"Racy musical interludes – item songs – are haphazardly inserted throughout; at one point, a flight mission awkwardly cuts to an out-of-place daydream in which the two scantily clad stars groove to a sizzling tune in some distant seaside resort\". Simon Abrams of RogerEbert.com stated that: A representatively energetic, but unexceptional musical number features lyrics like, “The lions are on the prowl tonight\", and the music numbers as pretty romantic. Sakshi Thirani of Common Sense Media said: \"The music and dance sequences, such a staple in Bollywood cinema, feel random and irritating instead of entertaining\".Umesh Punwani of Koimoi stated: \"Songs appearing out of nowhere in between an important mission are as intruding as you’d expect them to be\". The Indian Express reviewed the track \"Ishq Jaisa Kuch\" stating: \"The song might grow on the audience but the initial impact left by Deepika and Hrithik is simply unmissable.\" The Livemint quoted: \" Sanchit and Ankit Balhara’s score is as earwormy as their work on Pathaan.\" Critics at the board of Bollywood Hungama stated that music doesn't work as intended and is forgettable.\" They called 'Sher Khul Gaye' as catchy whereas 'Heer Aasmani' and 'Dil Banaane Waaleya' are woven into the narrative. The background score was praised as 'a big-screen cinematic appeal'. In his review for Times Internet, Aman Kumar noted: \"Though the music of Fighter didn’t catch much attention, “Mitti” and “Heer Aasmani” will surely stay with you for a while.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nThe music of the film was released on January 23, 2024. The original soundtrack consists of six songs out of which the first three in that order were released as singles. The two theme tracks were released as \"Fighter - Single\" on December 1, 2023. Post the film release, track \"Mitti\" was released as a single with vocals by Suresh Wadkar. Also, the film's anthem song \"Vande Mataram\" was released on January 25, 2024.\n\n\n=== Standard Edition ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n \nNotes\n\n\"Dil Chah Raha\" Hai is alternately referred as \"Bekaar Dil\" on music download platform.\n\n\n== Album Credits ==\nAll credits adapted from the liner notes of the album.\nKumaar - Lyrics (All tracks)\nMellow D - Lyrics (Track 1, 2), vocals (Track 2)\nAbhijit Nalani - Record producer (All tracks)\nKaran Kanchan - Additional music producer (Track 2)\nEric Pillai - Audio mixing (All tracks)\nGanesh Gangadharan - Sound design (All tracks)\nPritam Das - Sound design (All tracks)\nDipesh Verma - Low rhythm (Track 1)\nIqbal Azad - Dhol (Track 1)\nRhythm Shaw - Guitars (Track 1, 2, 4), bass guitars (Track 2, 4)\nWarren Mendonsa - Guitars (Track 3)\nAatur Soni - Drums (Track 4)\nLeo Olavio Velho - Cello (Track 5)\nSujan Chettri - Cello (Track 5)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVishal & Shekhar discography at Discogs\nFighter at IMDb",

        "content": "Mustafa Pehlivanoğlu (March 3, 1958 - October 7, 1980), was a Turkish ultranationalist militant. He was tried on August 10, 1978, allegedly for shooting four coffee lounges, killing 5 people and injuring 12, and was sentenced to death on October 18, 1979.\n\n\n== Background ==\nMustafa Pehlivanoğlu was born in Ayaş on March 3, 1958, and was involved in ultranationalist circles. During the Balgat massacre, on August 10, 1978, at around 21.00 in the Balgat district of Ankara, three coffee lounges, usually full of left-wingers, and two coffee lounges, usually full of Idealists, were the target of a drive-by shooting. Five people died, twelve people were injured as a result. In the investigation, it was determined that Pehlivanoğlu and Haydar Şahin, were the ones who carried out the attacks.\n\n\n== Trial, escape, and execution ==\nOn December 18, 1978, in Ankara, his trial started at the High Criminal Court. In addition to the Balgat Massacre, Mustafa Pehlivanoğlu was also tried for robbing a truck driver for an American factory in Balgat. The prosecutor demanded that he'd be charged with extortion, armed robbery, and murder. Emin Metin, a witness in the incident, said that a week before the massacre, Pehlivanoğlu was the coffee lounge where he was beaten by multiple leftists, and that Pehlivanoğlu said, \"I will make this place your graves.\" He was sentenced to death, and his death file was sent to the Turkish Grand National Assembly. Meanwhile, he escaped from the Mamak Military Prison, despite being heavily guarded. Necati Gültekin, Secretary General of the Nationalist Movement Party, said that he \"did not know about the incident and could not comment\". Atilla Sav, President of the Union of Turkish Bar Associations, said, \"you catch him, you punish him, and then he runs away. When this is the case, the situation that deters the crime disappears.\" The Prison Director was fired from his job. He was caught in Kütahya on August 16, 1980. In the interrogation, he said that he escaped from prison by digging his way out of the ceiling and wearing civilian clothes he bought. Pehlivanoğlu was sentenced to execution, and after the 1980 Turkish coup d'état when martial law was declared, he was hanged on October 7, 1980, in Mamak Prison.\nIdealist sources claim that Pehlivanoğlu was a victim of false accusation, and did not commit the shootings.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Minguel Fernandes (29 September 1889 – c. 1964), known professionally as Khadda Minguel (transl. Bearded Minguel), was an Indian playwright, composer, and singer known for his work in khell productions.\n\n\n== Career ==\nFernandes, also known as Kudd'ddo Minguel (Blind Mingel), was a figure in the realm of khells, a form of street theater, and held the title of \"Khellancho Raza\" (King of Khells). Known as a mestri, Fernandes showcased prowess as a playwright, composer, and singer. His compositions, encompassing both lyrics and melodies, were hailed for their artistic merit. Among his achievements was the creation of the fell (or khell) production titled Estrella, featuring cantos (songs). Fernandes exhibited skill in crafting the lyrics and melodies that graced these cantos, exemplifying his creative abilities. Despite his limited formal education and absence of professional music training, he displayed a talent for self-taught mastery of the violin and clarinet. While earning a livelihood as a toddy tapper, Fernandes composed songs during his ascents and descents of coconut trees. His original compositions, characterized by their ingenuity, were memorized and imparted to his khellgodde (khell actors). His contributions played a pivotal role in proliferating the reach and influence of khells, traditional folk dramas, throughout the state of Goa. Fernandes was recognized as a devout proponent and practitioner of the art form of khells. In the 2018 publication Konkani Khell Tiatr, writer and historian Wilson Mazarello commends Fernandes as one of the popular khell xikoupis (khell teachers) or mestris.\nFernandes served as a khellam mestri for a span of 30 years. Throughout his career, Fernandes crafted several zomnivoile fell or partio (Acts), with a particular emphasis on addressing pertinent social issues of the time. Often found engrossed in his creative process, he would pen these plays while seated in his bolcao (porch). Fernandes's influence extended beyond the realm of writing, as he dedicated himself to training aspiring youth from various localities, including Velim, Durga (Chinchinim), Benaulim, Varca, Carmona, Cuncolim, Assolna, Mobor, and Goa Velha. Leaving the comfort of his home in Durga, Chinchinim, he embarked on arduous journeys, spanning several weeks, to impart his knowledge and showcase zomnivoile khells through such performances. In return for his work, Fernandes received hospitality, as his fervent admirers and well-wishers delighted in treating him to meals and ensuring his relaxation. The impact of Fernandes's work resonated within the Goan theater community, inspiring a young playwright named Santiago Pereira from Cottombi, Quepem. Pereira, at the tender age of 17, heeded the call to train village boys in khells for the Carnival in Goa, spurred by the creative spirit kindled by Fernandes. In the twilight years of his life, Fernandes faced the loss of his eyesight. Nevertheless, this setback failed to deter his attachment for performance. Despite his condition, he continued to entertain audiences with his own khells and actively participated in the productions of fellow mestris. During this period, he came to be known as Kudd'ddo Minguel. Acknowledging his significant contributions, the 2018 publication Konkani Khell Tiatr by writer and historian Wilson Mazarello, featured a comprehensive list of popular khellam mestri of bygone eras. Among the mentioned names, Fernandes secured a place. The term \"khellam mestri\" denoted the artists involved in teaching and staging khells.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn observance of the accomplishments and legacies of deceased tiatr artistes who were born in September, the Tiatr Academy of Goa has consistently organized special programs to honor their contributions to the development of tiatr, encompassing its music, songs, and overall artistic landscape. Events were held on 27 September 2012, at Ravindra Bhavan in Margao, 5 September 2013, at the Black Box of Ravindra Bhavan in Margao, 24 September 2018, at the Conference Hall of Tiatr Academy in Panaji, and 30 September 2019, at the Black Box of Ravindra Bhavan in Margao. During these commemorative occasions, the Tiatr Academy of Goa paid tribute to a select group of individuals among whom Fernandes consistently featured. \nAlongside Fernandes, other artists such as Prem Kumar, Philomena Braz, Remmie Colaço, Seby Coutinho, Peter D'Costa, Rosalia Rodrigues, Star of Arossim, Inacio Rosario Luis (Jal), and Arnaldo Da Costa were also remembered for their significant contributions to tiatr. The events provided a platform to acknowledge and highlight the artistic achievements of these individuals, thereby preserving their artistic legacy within the tiatr community and beyond. By organizing these special programs, the Tiatr Academy of Goa not only paid homage to the artistes but also ensured that their contributions and artistic endeavors continued to be recognized and appreciated by the tiatr community and the wider public.\n\n\n== Selected stage works ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Southern Baptist traditionalism, also called Traditional Southern Baptist soteriology, Traditionalism or Provisionism are terms used to refer to the view of salvation commonly held within the Southern Baptist Convention. This view aligns neither with Classical Arminianism or Calvinism as it is distinguished from Arminianism by denying the Arminian doctrine of prevenient grace and the plausibility of losing one's salvation by teaching eternal security, while it differs from Calvinism by affirming libertarian free will and due to a denial of unconditional election. The view thus teaches that every man is able to respond positively to God's provision for mankind without a necessary internal change of man's nature happening prior to conversion, viewing the work of the Spirit through the preaching of the gospel as sufficient to enable a person to respond to positively to God.\nThe terminology of it being \"Traditional\" Southern Baptist soteriology has been criticized due to there already being Calvinist influences within the Southern Baptist Convention early on within its development. However, advocates of the view such as David L. Allen have argued that even though  there has always been a Calvinist presence within the SBC, the majority have historically rejected it.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Vahevala\" is a song that has been recorded by a multitude of artists over the years. It was originally a single by Loggins and Messina which became a hit for the duo in 1972.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe song was written by Dan Loggins and his friend Dann Lottermoser. It would have been a solo song for Kenny Loggins but Columbia Records head Clive Davis had his say about it and it was credited to the duo Loggins and Messina to continue their success. It appears on the duo's first album Sittin' In. The song is about an Island In Jamaica. There is no such island in reality, it is a made up place.  According a 1979 review for a recording of the song by a group called Sugar Cane by music trade magazine Radio & Record News, the song is an old favorite that keeps popping up from time to time under different guises.\nThere are differences on the spelling of the title. One example is by Sugar Cane who kept with the Jamaican tropical theme when they followed up their on hit \"Montego Bay\" with their version of this song, with the spelling of the title as \"Valhevala\".\n\n\n== Loggins & Messina version ==\n\nDan Loggins who composed the song is the older brother of Kenny Loggins. \n\nCreation\nWhile the song was being created, Loggins wanted the Jamaican feel to come out. To get the right atmosphere on the final making of it in the studio, they used steel drums and recorders. And to emphasize the narrative by Loggins, reverb was added to the bridge vocals. For the steel drums, Tommy Reynolds of Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds was brought in to help Jim Messina with capturing that feel. Messina knew that Reynolds had grown up in Jamaica. Reynolds said that they would need three drums including a lead drum to make it a full band. He made the drums for them and showed them how to play them. Messina told Reynolds that he thought Michael Omartian could handle it and from his memory, Omaritan, \"being the virtuoso he is, was able to pick up the sticks, and within a few hours, had it down.\" He also recalled that Omaritan played lead and Jon Clarke and Al Garth played the other steel drums. The result was that the song was taken to a place that it wouldn't have been able to go otherwise.\n\n\n=== Reception ===\nThe song was reviewed in the February 5 issue of Record World. The reviewer said that it was in essence a sea shanty type of song with the harmonies being of a CSN&Y flavor and that it couldn't help but grow on you (referring to radio DJs) and listeners.\nThe song was a Top 20 Spotlight in the February 12 issue of Billboard. Referring to it as a dynamite number, the reviewer said that it should prove to be a giant. It was also mispelt as Valevella.\n\n\n=== Airplay ===\nCanada\nIn Canada it was on the playlist of CKXL in Calgary for the week of April 22.\n\nUnited States\nThe February 12 issue of Billbord noted that Bobby Cole of FM station, KSAN in San Francisco, California reported that Loggins & Messina cuts \"Nobody But You\" and  \"Vahevella\" were seeing action. The following week the magazine noted that Ed Sciaky of WMMR-FM in Philadelphia had reported action on three songs from the Sittin' In album, \"Nobody But You,\" \"Vahevella Back to Georgia\", and Hauseat Pooh Corner\". Also in the same issue Ron Berger of WHCN-FM in Hartford reported action on the album cuts  \"Trilogy\", \"Nobody But You\", \"Back To Georgia\" and \"Vahevella\". \nOn the week of March 4, Billboard noted that Dex Bott of WLSU, (Louisiana State University) reported play on \"Vahevella\". Also in the same issue there was action on the cuts \"Danny's Song,\" \"Vahevella,\" \"Lovin' Me,\" \"Back to Georgia\" on stations WCBS-FM and WKTK-FM.\nIt was noted by Record World in the March 25 issue that the song was on the playlist of WCFL in Chicago.\n\n\n=== Charts ===\nIt entered the Record World 101 150 Singles chart at no. 136 on the week of March 18, staying in the chart with the last entry of 107 on April 14 before debuting in the Singles chart (Top 100) the following week at no. 95. It peaked at no. 87 on the week of May 20 which was its final week in the chart.\nOn the week of March 18, the single made its debut at no. 113 in the Billboard Bubbling Under The Hot 100 chart.

        "content": "Bhakti Vilas, also known as Bhakti Vilasom was a state palace in Travancore, located at Vazhuthacaud, in the capital Trivandrum, built at the end of the 19th century. It was formally the secondary official residence of the Diwan of Travancore outside of the royal fort complex; the primary official residence being Padma Vilas, but widely preferred by most Diwans. The style, that of a bungalow, hybridized traditional Malayali kovilakam architecture with western elements: the palace featured a traditional nadumuttam, or interior courtyard, but one spatially differing from the classical atrium of a Nālukettu. Bhakti Vilas further accented its semicircular arches with pilasters of a modified Ionic order. During the premiership of Sir C.P. Ramaswami Iyer, Bhakti Vilas was placed at his disposal as one of his official residences, although he extraordinarily also enjoyed Kanakakunnu Palace as his primary official residence.\nIn 1952, Travancore Radio became All India Radio Trivandrum and its office shifted from Palayam to Bhakti Vilas Palace.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Alaíde Costa Silveira Mondin Gomide, known as Alaíde Costa (born 8 December 1935), is a Brazilian singer-songwriter.\n\n\n== Life ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nAlaíde Costa was born in Rio de Janeiro, in the neighborhood of Méier. Her brother enrolled her in a local children's singing competition,  and as a 13-year-old she was hosted by Rádio Tupi in the program Sequência G3 winning a singing competition, and the following year in Rádio Nacional's Arraia miúda, both broadcasts for young talents. Later, she appeared in Pescando estrelas, a radio show hosted by Ary Barroso for Rádio Clube do Brasil.\n\n\n=== Artistic career ===\nShe debuted as a professional singer in 1957 at the Avenida club, in Rio de Janeiro, the same venue where two other musical stars, Elizeth Cardoso and Ângela Maria began their careers. Two years later she was in the recording studio for two 78rpm records. The first featured the songs Conselhos and Domingo de amor, the second, entitled Tarde demais, was awarded revelation of the year. Despite having a bolero musical background, in 1959 Alaíde Costa was won over to bossa nova by João Gilberto and recorded her first album titled Gosto de você, in which the singer took up compositions by some of the major authors of the new genre: among them Dolores Duran, João Donato, Carlos Lyra , Ronaldo Bôscoli, Oldemar Magalhães, Paulo Tito, Tom Jobim, Vinícius de Moraes, as well as Gilberto himself. That year Alaíde Costa participated in a performance held at the Faculty of Architecture in Rio along with many young musician names and captivated the audience with her rendition of Chora tua tristeza, composed by Oscar Castro-Neves and Fiorini, becoming the most acclaimed artist along with Sylvia Telles. Two months later she was on stage in another bossa nova composers' performance  organized by Bôscoli, and in December with other artists in the Rádio Globo concert hall.  At the end of the year, Costa reunited with another bossa nova musicians  in a gathering  brought together by the magazine O Cruzeiro; among them were Gilberto, Luiz Bonfá, Bôscoli, Lyra, Roberto Menescal, Telles, Nara Leão, Oscar and Iko Castro-Neves, Luiz Eça, Chico Feitosa, Nana Caymmi and others, along with Ary Barroso who, as a representative of the older musical generation, conceptually passed the baton with his presence.\nShe released another LP of bossa nova hits  in 1960 under the title Alaíde canta suavemente; many of the previously mentioned composers were joined by Oscar Castro-Neves, Maria Cecília, Aloysio de Oliveira, Luiz Bandeira, Roberto Menescal and Newton Mendonça; that year the singer participated in bossa nova concerts in Rio de Janeiro. The following year, she released the LP Alaíde jóia moderna; in this work, in addition to using compositions by other artists such as Baden Powell and Billy Blanco, she starred as a songwriter with the song Canção de amor sem fim , written in collaboration with Geraldo Vandré. In 1962 the singer got married and moved from Rio de Janeiro to São Paulo. – where, hired by Odeon, Costa had been kept away from the recording studio, a conduct that the singer accused as a form of racism by the record company.\nThe LP Afinal..., released in 1963, took its title from the title track composed by Alaíde Costa, who in this work also recorded songs by other composers including Paulinho Nogueira. The following year was one of successful live performances. At the Teatro Paramount  in São Paulo she was one among many leading figures in the show O fino da bossa, with a rich lineup of musicians, some from Rio de Janeiro - Nara Leão, Jorge Ben, Wanda Sá, Rosinha de Valença, Os Cariocas, Marcos Valle - and other Paulistas born or raised, such as Walter Wanderley, Paulinho Nogueira, Claudette Soares and the Zimbo Trio;  and on that occasion Alaíde Costa achieved great public and critical success with the song Onde está você. At the Teatro Santa Rosa in Rio she was on stage together with Castro-Neves, back in São Paulo she took part in the 1st University Festival of the TV Tupi station, and performed at the Teatro Municipal in Alaíde alaúde, a recital of Renaissance music. 1965 saw the release of the LP Alaíde Costa, which included compositions by Valle, Castro-Neves and Chico Buarque and featured Tudo o que é meu, written by the singer in collaboration with Vinícius de Moraes.\nDue to health problems, the singer retired from the stage until 1972, when she participated in the LP Clube da Esquina with the inclusion, in the company of Milton Nascimento, of the song Me deixa em paz. From the same year is the maxi single that includes Diz, Enlouqueci, Ansiedade and E a gente sonhando. Another LP, produced by Aloysio de Oliveira, was released the following year, Alaíde Costa e Oscar Castro Neves, containing a composition by the singer, Amigo amado, co-written with Vinícius, and other songs by Carlos Lyra, Vinícius de Moraes, and Oscar Castro-Neves. 1974 saw her in the recording studio for an LP, Alaíde Costa, and a maxi single with four tracks. She participated alongside Johnny Alf and Lúcio Alves in the Bossa Nova installment of the MPB-100 radio series, from which eight albums were made. She also released the single Onde está você, re-recorded by the singer. The following year the album Coração was released, with a song of her own composition, and in 1982 she included compositions by Hermínio Bello de Carvalho reproduced on the LP Águas vivas: Alaíde Costa canta Hermínio Bello de Carvalho. In 1988 she recorded Amiga de verdade, featuring, in addition to Costa, Paulinho da Viola, Egberto Gismonti and Milton Nascimento. Three years later, in São Paulo, she performed with Nogueira in the show Coração violão and in another show titled Alaíde canta Tom Jobim. São Paulo's Municipal Theater welcomes her back in a show in which she sang Jobim's songs, to great success.\nIn 2000 she released the CD Falando de amor  and performed as a featured artist in Rio de Janeiro's Mistura Fina and Vinicius Piano Bar venues. Three years later she performed with Johnny Alf at Queen Elizabeth Hall participating in the London Jazz Festival, and in 2005 she released the CD Tudo que o tempo me deixou, where Costa was backed by a quintet. That same year, in Paris, she participated in the Brasil Brasileiro festival with Elza Soares and Jair Rodrigues. In 2011 the box set 100 anos de Música Popular Brasileira was released, four CDs that include songs by many Brazilian artists and in which Alaíde Costa sings Desafinado and Eu não existo sem você, by Jobim and Mendonça, Garota de Ipanema by Jobim and Vinícius, and Lobo bobo by Carlos Lyra and Ronaldo Bôscoli. Three years later she published Canção de Alaíde, containing bossa nova classics composed by the singer together with other musicians. From the same year came Ricardo Santhiago's book Alaíde Costa: faria tudo de novo, a biography tracing the singer's artistic career. To celebrate the artist's 80th birthday, a show tracing her work was presented. In the same year, also as part of the celebrations, Alaíde Costa released the album Alegria é guardada em cofres, catedrais, together with guitarist Toninho Horta. In 2022 she released the CD O que meus calos dizem sobre mim. In 2023 she presented at Carnegie Hall, in the show “Bossa Nova: The Greatest Night,  60 years after the 1962 first international bossa nova concert in the same venue, in which she did not perform.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== LP ===\n1959 – Gosto de você • RCA Victor • LP\n1960 – Alaíde canta suavemente • RCA Victor\n1961 – Alaíde, jóia moderna • RCA Victor • LP\n1963 – Afinal...  • Audio Fidelity\n1965 – Alaíde Costa • Som Maior\n1972 – Clube da Esquina • EMI-Odeon\n1973 – Alaide Costa & Oscar Castro Neves • Odeon\n1975 – Alaíde Costa • Coronado/Odeon\n1976 – Coração • EMI/Odeon • LP\n1982 – Águas vivas • Vento de Raio\n1988 – Amiga de verdade • Independente\n\n\n=== CD ===\n1993 – No Tom da Mangueira • Saci • CD\n1995 – Alaíde Costa & João Carlos Assis Brasil • Movieplay • CD\n1996 – Songbook Tom Jobim • Lumiar Discos • CD\n1997 – Pouco pra mim • Dabliú Discos • CD\n1998 – Milton Nascimento-Sua vida, sua música • Reader's Digest • CD\n2000 – Falando de amor • CID • CD\n2005 – Tudo que o tempo me deixou • CD\n2011 – 100 Anos de Música Popular Brasileira (various artists) – participation – Instituto Cultural Cravo Albin/Discobertas – Box con 4 CD\n2014 – Canções de Alaíde • Selo Nova estação • CD\n2015 – Alegria é Guardada em Cofres, Catedrais - Com Toninho Horta • Independent • CD\n2022 - O que meus calos dizem sobre mim\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n1957 – Conselhos/Domingo de amor • 78\n1957 – Tarde demais • 78\n1972 – Diz/Ansiedade/Enlouqueci/E a gente sonhando • Maxi single\n1972 – Diariamente/Antes e depois • single\n1973 – Alaíde Costa • Odeon • single\n1974 – Calvário/Avenida fechada/Primavera/O rei da França na ilha da assombração • Maxi single\n1975 – Alaide Costa • Odeon • single\n1975 – Onde está você • single\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nCastro, Ruy (2005).

        "content": "Hadjo Djibo is a community leader from Niger known for her proactive efforts in addressing water quality issues and advocating for gender equality in local governance. In a community where residents were consuming poor-quality water from a severely damaged well, Hadjo Djibo took decisive action. She collected a sample of the contaminated water and presented it to the mayor, prompting immediate repairs to the well. This initiative led to the commune prioritizing access to clean drinking water for all villagers, significantly improving public health and well-being. Hadjo Djibo attributes her success in community development to the training she received from CARE, an international humanitarian organization. She fondly refers to CARE as her \"unforgettable school,\" acknowledging the organization's role in equipping her with the necessary skills and knowledge to effect positive change in her community. Despite her achievements, Hadjo remains committed to furthering her efforts. She emphasizes the need for increased female representation in local governance, highlighting the fact that out of fourteen councilors in her commune, only two are women. Hadjo believes that gender equality in decision-making processes is essential for inclusive and sustainable development. Through her leadership and advocacy, Hadjo Djibo continues to inspire others and drive positive change in her community and beyond.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Larry Holmes vs. Tim Witherspoon, billed as The Crown Affair, was a professional boxing match contested on 20 May 1983, for the WBC and The Ring heavyweight championship.\n\n\n== Background ==\nHaving made 14 consecutive defences of his heavyweight title, the longest uninterrupted heavyweight reign since Joe Louis, Larry Holmes having fought once already in 1983 (a one sided win against former European champion Lucien Rodriguez) agreed to face the undefeated Tim Witherspoon.\nThe event was billed as the world's first ever Heavyweight championship double header, with Michael Dokes making the first defence of his WBA belt in a rematch with Mike Weaver, after their first bout ended in a controversial first round stoppage.\nHolmes, who was a 6 to 1 on favourite with bookies, predicted he would knock out the underdog, saying that he \"wasn't qualified to be in the same ring with me\".\n\n\n== The fights ==\n\n\n=== Undercard ===\nOn the undercard Greg Page defeated Renaldo Snipes in a WBC Heavyweight Title Eliminator, and Ossie Ocasio successfully defended his WBA cruiserweight title.\n\n\n=== Dokes vs Weaver II ===\n\nIn the co-feature for the WBA championship, Dokes and Weaver engaged in an entertaining slugfest that went the full 15 rounds. When the scorecards for this bout were read, judge Jerry Roth had the fight 145-141 for Dokes, but judges Larry Hazzard and Harold Lederman scored the bout a draw at 144-144 and 143-143, respectively, resulting in a majority draw and Dokes retaining the title. It was the first time in 69 years, dating back to the contest between Jack Johnson and Battling Jim Johnson in December 1913, that a world Heavyweight championship contest resulted in a draw.\n\n\n=== Main Event ===\nWitherspoon appeared to land a greater number of hard shots than the champion. In the ninth round, a right hand to the side of the head early, had Holmes in trouble. A left hook-right hand combination sent the champion into the ropes, where Witherspoon launched a barrage of punches in an attempt to finish the fight but Holmes was able to survive the round.\nAt the end of 12 rounds, judge Herb Santos scored the bout 115–114 for Witherspoon, while Chuck Hassett scored it 118–111 and Chuck Minker had it 115–113 both in favour of the champion, giving Holmes a split decision. The AP scored it for Holmes 115–113, while KO Magazine had it 114–114.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe crowd booed the decision, many clearing feeling with Witherspoon deserved the victory. Witherspoon himself would say post match \"I definitely thought I won. He's a great champion, but I think I'm better. I know I am.\" Holmes acknowledged it was a tougher fight than he was expecting, saying \"Witherspoon had more than I thought he did. Or maybe I'm just going down a little bit. A couple of fights ago, the man wouldn't have worn my socks.\"\n\n\n== Undercard ==\nConfirmed bouts:\n\n\n== Broadcasting ==\n\n\n== References ==",

The play premiered on Broadway as part of the Manhattan Theatre Club's 2023–2024 season.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe play takes the audiences inside Jaja's bustling hair braiding salon in Harlem where every day, a lively and eclectic group of West African immigrant hair braiders are creating masterpieces on the heads of neighborhood women. During one sweltering summer day, love will blossom, dreams will flourish and secrets will be revealed. The uncertainty of their circumstances simmers below the surface of their lives and when it boils over, it forces this tight-knit community to confront what it means to be an outsider on the edge of the place they call home.\n\n\n== Original cast and characters ==\n\n\n== Production history ==\nThe play premiered on Broadway at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre on October 3, 2023, with previews starting September 12. The play closed on November 19, 2023, after 56 performances. The show extended twice from its original end date and offered live streams of the show for the final week of performances. The play was directed by Whitney White and was commissioned by the Williamstown Theatre Festival in 2018. Among the producers of the show are LaChanze and Taraji P. Henson.\nFollowing the Broadway production, the show is set to tour, beginning in September at Arena Stage in Washington D.C., Berkeley Repertory Theatre in November, and Chicago Shakespeare Theater in January 2025. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n​Jaja's African Hair Braiding​ at the Internet Broadway Database\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Jeremy van Mullem (born 18 March 1999) is a Dutch professional footballer who plays as a defensive midfielder for Eerste Divisie club Cambuur.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nVan Mullem began his youth career at VV Zwaluwen and later moved to Feyenoord's academy, where he signed his first professional contract in 2018.\nAfter one season with Jong Feyenoord, his contract expired in 2019, and he left on a free transfer to SSV Jeddeloh in Germany, competing in Regionalliga Nord. He made his debut for Jeddeloh on 21 July 2019, in a 1–1 draw at home against VfB Oldenburg in the Lower Saxony Cup. As the match ended in a draw, a penalty shootout ensued, resulting in Jeddeloh's elimination. A week later, on 27 July, he played his first league match, a 3–1 loss to VfB Lübeck. Van Mullem would go on to make a total of 21 appearances in the Regionalliga Nord before the league was indefinitely suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n=== Sparta Rotterdam ===\nIn 2020, Van Mullem joined Jong Sparta Rotterdam on an amateur contract, where he made his first appearance in the Tweede Divisie on 5 September 2020, against Jong Volendam. After six matches, the Tweede Divisie was cancelled due to COVID-19, and Van Mullem did not feature for Jong Sparta again.\nTowards the end of the 2020–21 season, he was included in the first-team squad of Sparta Rotterdam for several matches. He made his debut for Sparta in the last game of the regular season, a 2–1 away victory against SC Heerenveen in the Eredivisie, coming on as a substitute for Wouter Burger in the 74th minute. In May 2022, Van Mullem extended his contract with Sparta for two more seasons.\n\n\n=== Cambuur ===\nOn 1 September 2023, Van Mullem signed a two-year contract with an option for an additional season with recently relegated Eerste Divisie club Cambuur. He made his competitive debut for the club on 9 September, starting in a 3–1 league win over Den Bosch. On 6 November, he scored his first goal for Cambuur in a dominant 8–1 away victory against TOP Oss; the latter's most significant home defeat ever.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\nAs of match played 15 March 2024\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJeremy van Mullem at Soccerway",

        "content": "Sugar Cane was a Eurodisco group with Latin disco and Caribbean musical style. They had several singles released in the late 1970s. They found greater success with their version of the Bobby Bloom hit \"Montego Bay\" which is what the group is more likely to be remembered for.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe lineup included Reggie Tsiboe and Linda Taylor. Tsiboe was already a recording artist and had composed both sides of his 1974 single, \"Please Don't Bring Your Sister\" which was credited to Reggie Seeboe and released on Cube Records. The single was actually reviewed by Ron McCreight for the April 27, 1974 issue of Record World. Calling it a most interesting single for many weeks, he also said that it deserved to be a world-wide smash. Taylor, a former housewife had been in a funk band called Sox for a period of time.Carroll Thompson auditioned for the group at one stage and was a backing singer. In an interview for the Record Collector magazine, Thompson said that frank Farian had put the group together. At the audtion she met a girl who turned out to be the neice of the legendary Jamaican producer, Leonard Chin.Visually in performance and on record covers, the group was composed of three males and two females.The group had good success with \"Montego Bay\" and followed up with their Caribbean-disco version of the Loggins and Messina song \"Valhevala\". This was also the first success that Linda Taylor encountered in her career.\n\n\n== Career ==\nA single \"\tCoconut-Party\" bw \"Chilly Chilly Boo Boo\" credited to the group was released on EMI 006-32 426 in October 1977. Both sides were composed by Ben Juris and Benny Lux. Juris handled the arrangements of both sides.\n\"Montego Bay\"The group recorded their version of the Bobby Bloom hit, \"Montego Bay\". It was produced by P. Bellotte and released on Ariola 7716. John Wishart  gave the song a very good review in the August 12 issue of Record Mirror with Wishart saying that \"Montego Bay\" was such a good song that it could withstand any treatment. He said that in some ways it was an improvement on Bobby Bloom's 1970 hit and it was nice to hear men and women sharing vocals for a change. Their single was also reviewed in the August 19 issue of Record World. A Single Pick, the Latin disco element was called a perfect fit and the fitting together of the harmony vocals with the smooth instrumentation were noted. The August 19 issue of Music Week showed that the single was an ad on at Radio Orwell in Ipswich and Pat Gibson of Radio Blackburn had it as a hit pick.According to the September 2 issue of Music Week, the single was now a breaker. It was also an add on at Beacon Radio in Wolverhampton. It was getting played in the US. It was shown by Cash Box in the September 9 issue that it was an add on at KDKO in Denver.Sugar Cane appeared on Top of the Pops which was aired on 28 September. Other acts to appear on that same episode included Third World with \"Now That We've Found Love\", Lindisfarne with \"Juke Box Gypsy\" and Frankie Miller with \"Darlin’\".Now in the charts and a hit, it had moved from no. 43 to no. 32 on the UK Disco Top 90 for the week of September 30, 1978. On the week of October 13 it debuted at no. 75 in the Radio & Record News National Top Singles chart. It also did the same in the Independent Record National Top 100 Singles chart. It was also on the Swansea Sound 257 playlist, the 208 Top 40 playlist, the Big L Disco Dozen playlist, the Radio Tees playlist, the Capital Radio 194  playlist, the Piccadilly 261 playlist, the Radio Clyde playlist, the Radio Trent playlist, and the 194 Radio Forth playlst. The following week it had dropped down to no 77 on both the Radio & Record News National Top Singles and Independent Record National Top 100 Singles charts.It peaked at no. 13 on the Music Week Disco Top 40 chart on the week of October 21. It would spend five weeks on the main UK chart, peaking at no. 54. It was still in the Music Week Disco Top 40 chart at no. 36 on the week of November 18.\nThe single had also been released in Italy on Dig It DG 1182. It became a dance hit for them there and for the week of February 17, 1979, it was at no. 19.\nFurther activitiesThey recorded the Loggins & Messina song \"Vahevala\" but the single was mis-spelt as \"Valhevala\".  Backed with the Geoff Bastow, Keith Forsey, Pete Bellotte composition \"Too Bad It Ain't Good\", it was released on Ariola AHA 533 on February 2, 1979. It was reviewed in the March 9 issue of Radio & Record News. The song had been covered by many artists but had never been a hit and it kept popping up from time to time. The reviewer said it could do the same as the previous record, but was guarded in predicting success.  There was to be expected interest following their previous hit. Tony Jasper commented in the February 24 issue of Music Week that the Caribbean disco number with its light and bright feel with the vocals and instrumentation, it should do well on afternoon programs and there could be a brief chart outing.It was reported by Music Week that \"Valhevala\" was added to the playlist of Radio Victory in Portsmouth. Their single was now doing well on air. It was reported in the February 24, 1979 issue of Music Week that it was a hit pick on Radio Forth in Edinburgh, Swansea Sound in Swansea, BBC Scotland The record had been released in Australia that month on RCA Victor 103247.As of September, 1979, the group was still on the Ariola / Hansa artist roster.\n\n\n== Later years ==\nLinda Taylor would become a member of the disco group  Gonzales,  and record as a solo artist having hits with \"You and Me Just Started\" and \"Every Waking Hour\".\nReggie Tsiboe would later join Boney M in 1982. Later he would find work as an actor.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDiscogs - Sugar Cane\nDJ Pete Pop channel, Feb 14, 2024 - Sugar Cane - Montego Bay (Stereo) (Ariola) 1978 (audio)\nsimon taylor channel, Nov 19, 2013 - Sugar Cane Montego Bay TOTP 28 9 78 (video)\nDJ Roland Vinyl channel, Jul 4, 2020 - Sugar Cane - Valhevala (audio)\nDJ Roland Vinyl channel, Nov 17, 2021 - Sugar Cane - Too Bad It Ain't Good",

        "content": "\"Too Sweet\"  is a song by Irish singer-songwriter Hozier. It was released on 22 March 2024, through Rubyworks Records, Island Records and Columbia Records, as the first track from his fifth EP Unheard and was released as a single on 29 March 2024. The song has topped the charts in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, becoming Hozier's first number-one single in all four countries. It has also peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming his second top-10 single in the United States.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn 14 March 2024, Hozier announced his fifth EP Unheard that features four previously unreleased tracks taken from sessions for his third studio album Unreal Unearth (2023). The singer clarified that the songs \"could not make the original release\" for various reasons, but still fit the themes of \"gluttony, limbo, violence and the outward 'ascent'\". He first teased the song the same day on TikTok in a clip that features him drawing a sketch of a skeleton. \"Too Sweet\" was surprise-released as the opening track to the project on 22 March.\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\"Too Sweet\" sees Hozier meeting the \"rhythm of a true night owl\", sipping whiskey and drinking black coffee. Additionally, it shows the facets and multitudes of a relationship, as the singer talks to his significant other. While she prefers to lead a healthy lifestyle, he makes use of the various \"pleasures\" of life. The singer favours the rawness because his partner is \"already too sweet\". The song further explores the theme of how differences can evolve during a relationship.\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\n\"Too Sweet\" debuted at number 8 on the UK Singles Chart on 29 March 2024, earning Hozier his first top-ten single in the United Kingdom since \"Take Me to Church\" in 2014 and second overall. It rose to number 4 on 5 April 2024. On 12 April 2024, it reached the summit of the chart with 61,000 chart units and 6.7 million streams, becoming Hozier's first UK number one single.\nIt also debuted at number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 on the week of 6 April 2024, earning Hozier his first top-ten single since \"Take Me to Church\", his second overall, and his first overall to debut within the top 10. Two weeks later the song reached a peak of number two, becoming Hozier's highest-charting song to date.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

The EP features seven tracks in total, including the lead single, \"I'm Not Over You\".\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter enlisting for his mandatory military service on October 11, 2016, Ryeowook was discharged on July 10, 2018. He joined Super Junior's fifth world tour Super Show 7 starting from November 2018's Bangkok stop, and his vocals was featured in their first extended play, One More Time.\nOn November 27, Label SJ announced that Ryeowook will release his second mini album on December 10, this marked Ryeowook's solo release in two years. Pre-release single \"One and Only\" was released alongside the announcement.\nHowever, the date of the EP's release was pushed back to January 2, 2019, after Ryeowook was diagnosed with Influenza A after returning from Bangkok.\nOn January 2, 2019, the EP was officially released alongside the music video of its lead single, \"I'm Not Over You\".\n\n\n== Composition ==\nDrunk on Love has a variety of genres in each song. Ballad tracks were present in lead single \"I'm Not Over You\", which features a gentle piano melody and melancholic strings in the buildup for its orchestral climax, and the last track, \"The 2nd Story\". \"One and Only\" leans toward lounge music. \"Something Good\", and \"Sugar\" have noticeable jazz flavors with their own respective identities. \"Without You\" has an R&B-esque sound with Latin pop melody.\nIn an interview with The Korea Times, Ryeowook recounted that he spent a lot of time thinking what musical genre of path he's going to pursue for the album during his conscription. He also stated that he would try writing and composing more songs by himself for his solo work and expressed his wishes for Drunk on Love to serve as the turning point for his solo career.\n\n\n== Promotions ==\nRyeowook promoted the EP with a performance of \"I'm Not Over You\" in Music Bank on January 4.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nWriting for the South China Morning Post, Chris Gillett praised Ryeowook's vocals and the variety of genre available but criticized the album as \"too safe\" instead of trying to stand out.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Battle of Jabobshavn (Danish: Søslaget ved Jakobshavn, Dutch: slag bij maklykout, Greenlandic: Ilulissani qaleruaq eqqaani) also referred to as the Battle of Ilulissat, was a battle between Danish and Dutch ships over the control of Ilulissat (Then Jakobshavn) on 6 June 1739. It has been the only naval battle fought over the rights of Greenland. The battle is sometimes also been mentioned as the Battle of Maklykout, referring to the Dutch name of the trading post.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nSince the missions of Hans Egede, the Dano-Norwegians were recolonizing Greenland. Frederick IV of Denmark allowed for the establishment of the Bergen Greenland Company, which was charged with the administration and trade on Greenland. Yet Frederick refused to grant the company a monopoly on the island in fear of antagonizing Dutch whalers in the area. During the first decades of the company it witnessed bankruptcy, diseases like smallpox and scurvy, and constant Dutch raids.\n\n\n=== Whaling rivalry ===\n\nDutch whalers had been active in Greenland since the 17th century. This resulted in constant conflict over the monopol to the whaling industry and the trade with Inuit between Danes and Dutchmen. Denmark claimed their historic rights to the island and pointed to the Norse settlements in Greenland, but also to the expeditions to Greenland by Christian IV and Frederick III, The latter included the Greenlandic Polar Bear on his personal arms as a sign of Danish sovereignty over the island. \nOn the other hand, the Dutch claimed the island on the basis of their expeditions and trade companies operating in the area.\nBecause of the Bergen Company's early failure, Jacob Severin convinced the new King, Christian VI, and his council to grant the company a full monopoly over trade on Greenland in 1734. Severin received the right to fly the Danebrog in order to fend off foreign ships. He also expanded Danish presence on the west coast, establishing the settlements of Christianshaab (1734), Jakobshavn (1741) and Frederikshaab (1742.) This unsatisfued the Dutch whalers in the area and the opposing sides came in combat at Jakobshavn in 1739.\n\n\n== Battle ==\n\nA Dutch fortilla of four ships were moored in their habour of Maklykout (Which later got named Jakobshavn in honor of Jakob Severin) outside of Disko Bay. The Dutch had started trading with the local Greenlanders when they were caught by three Danish ships commanded by Jacob Severin. The Danes fired warning shots at the Dutch fortilla, yet the Dutch refused to leave the habour. Severin, in response, attacked the fortilla and the insued battle lasted about an hour, during which the Dutch suffered significant damage, before they lowered their flags, surrendered and conceded their four ships to the Danes. This battle led to the consolidation of Danish presence on the island, and would be the only major naval battle fought over the rights of Greenland.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSouth Greenland – Danish inspectorate\nDutch colonial empire – Overseas territories controlled by the Dutch Republic and the Netherlands\nBattle of Öland – Naval battle between an allied Danish-Dutch fleet and the Swedish navy in the Baltic Sea\nNuuk – Capital and largest city of Greenland\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Calvagh O'More (Irish: An Calbhach Ó Mórdha) (1540 - 27 March 1618), also known as Callagh, The Calough or Charles, was an Irish-born loyalist of noble ancestry.\nHe was raised in England. Upon returning to Ireland in his early thirties, he was granted an estate in Balyna by the Crown, which was owned by his descendants until 1960.\nHis brother and father were Irish chiefs - the Lord of Laois - and his son Rory O'Moore was a leader of the Irish Rebellion of 1641.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nCalvagh O'More was born in 1540 in Portlaoise, Laois. His father was Rory Caoch O'More, Irish chief and Lord of Laois. His mother was Margaret Butler, granddaughter of Piers Butler, 8th Earl of Ormond.\nUpon Rory's death at the hands of his brother Giolla Pádraig, it seems that Margaret removed Calvagh and his siblings from Laois.\n\n\n== Time in England ==\nO'More was brought up in England, and was called 'The Calough' by the English. As he describes himself as of Gray's Inn in 1568, he may be the John Callow who entered there in 1567.\nHis loyalist tendencies were in stark contrast to his brother Rory Oge O'More, a staunch rebel who became Lord of Laois in 1557, and returned to Ireland in the early 1560s to lead his clan against the Tudor army.\n\n\n== Return to Ireland ==\nIn 1571, Ormond petitioned for Calvagh O'More's return. Soon afterwards he came back to Ireland, and in 1574, was granted an estate at Balyna, near Moyvalley, County Kildare. The estate was granted by Elizabeth I in an attempt to stop the ongoing violence between the Tudors and O'More's brother Rory.\nIn 1582, O'More was thought to be a sufficiently strong adherent to the English to receive a grant of land in Laois. He also possessed part of the ancestral property of Owen Roe O'Neill in County Armagh, and received grants of land in Meath and Dublin.\nIn 1585, Sir Thomas FitzGerald of Laccagh posted bond for O'More, referencing his \"good conduct [and] appearance when called for.\"\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nO'More married Margaret Scurlock. Their son Rory was born about 1600, either in Laois, or more likely at the Balyna estate. Another son was named Lewis.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nOn 27 March 1618, O'More died in Balyna. His son Lewis inherited his Balyna estate, and it remained in the ownership of the O'More family until it was sold in 1960.\nO'More's son Rory went on to become one of the principal organisers of the Irish Rebellion of 1641. Through Rory, O'More is a direct ancestor of Diana, Princess of Wales and, by extension, her son William. James Moore Sr., governor of Carolina, claimed descent from Calvagh through Rory.\n\n\n== Family tree ==\n\nSources\n\nAnnals of the Four Masters\nDictionary of Irish Biography (October 2009)\nÓ Raghallaigh, Eoghan (2010). \"A poem to Rudhraighe Caoch Ó Mórdha, lord of Laois 1542-7\" (PDF).

        "content": "Lissanthe rubicunda is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae and is endemic to the south of Western Australia. It is a slender, erect to spreading shrub with few branches and sharply-pointed linear leaves and short spikes or racemes of red, tube-shaped flowers.\n\n\n== Description ==\nLissanthe rubicunda is a slender, erect to spreading shrub with few branches that typically grows to a height of up to 1 m (3 ft 3 in). Its leaves are sharply-pointed, and mostly about 6.5 mm (0.26 in) long and furrowed on the lower surface. The flowers are borne in short spikes or racemes on the ends of the branches, each flower on a pedicel about 1 mm (0.039 in) long with smaller bracts and bracteoles at the base. The sepals are broadly egg-shaped and about 1 mm (0.039 in) long and the petal are red, joined at the base, forming a tube about 6.5 mm (0.26 in) long with lobes more than 2 mm (0.079 in) long and bearded near the ends.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThis species was first formally described in 1864 by Ferdinand von Mueller who gave it the name Cyathodes rubicunda in his Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae from specimens collected by George Maxwell. In 1867, Mueller transferred the species to Styphelia as S. rubicunda in a later edition of the Fragmenta.\nIn 2005, Jocelyn Marie Powell, Crayn and Elizabeth Brown transferred the species to Lissanthe as L. rubicunda in Australian Systematic Botany. The specific epithet (rubicunda) means \"red\" or \"ruddy\".\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nLissanthe rubicunda grows in sandy and clay soils, spongolite, limestone and laterite on planis, slopes, watercourses, swamp edges and winter-wet places in the Coolgardie, Esperance Plains and Mallee bioregions of southern Western Australia.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Augusto José de Matos Sobral Cid (1941–2019), better known as Augusto Cid was a Portuguese cartoonist, caricaturist, illustrator, and sculptor.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nCid was the son of Fernando Augusto de Resende Sobral Cid and Maria Manuela Bicker Correia Ribeiro. He was born in Horta on Faial Island in the Azores when his father, an army lieutenant, was posted there and his wife accompanied him. Cid completed secondary studies at the Colégio Infante de Sagres and Colégio Moderno in Lisbon, and then studied in the US. Later, he attended a sculpture course at the Lisbon School of Fine Arts, after serving in Angola at a time when Portuguese men were conscripted to oppose independence movements in the Portuguese colonies.\n\n\n== Career as a cartoonist ==\nCid tried several jobs but his career as a caricaturist and a cartoonist only took off after the Carnation Revolution of 25 April 1974 when the censorship imposed by the Estado Novo dictatorship was lifted. His first published cartoons were with Povo Livre, the official organ of the then Democratic People's Party (PPD), a right-of-centre party. He also designed the PPD's logo. Later he published in newspapers such as O Diabo, O Independente, Grande Reportagem and Semanário, a weekly journal founded by, among others, the present president of Portugal, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. His controversial cartoons often attacked extreme left politicians such as the Communist Party leader Álvaro Cunhal. Despite the lifting of censorship, two of his books, O Superman and Eanito, el Estático, both poking fun at António Ramalho Eanes who was the president between 1976 and 1986, were seized as a result of court orders.\nIn addition to his artistic work, he was noted for his commitment to identifying the causes of the 1980 Camarate plane crash in which the president, Francisco de Sá Carneiro and Adelino Amaro da Costa, the first civilian defence minister after the revolution, were killed. Cid was convinced that the plane had crashed as a result of a bomb and it was largely due to him that the idea that it was not an accident emerged. The actual cause has never been satisfactorily resolved.\n\n\n== Sculpture ==\nIn September 2012 Cid announced his retirement from cartooning, to dedicate himself exclusively to sculpture. Nevertheless, at the end of 2015, he resumed his activity as a cartoonist, in the weekly newspaper Sol, using bullfighting analogies. As a sculptor, he sculpted a tribute to the victims of the September 11 attacks in New York City in 2001, which is to be found in Lisbon at the intersection of the Avenida de Roma and the Avenida dos Estados Unidos da América; a statue in honour of Nuno Álvares Pereira a 14th-century Portuguese general, who played a major role in ensuring the independence of Portugal from Spain; and a statue in Funchal, Madeira of João Gonçalves Zarco, an early explorer.\n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\nOn June 9, 1994, Cid was made Commander of the Portuguese Order of Prince Henry. Among other distinctions, he received the First Prize for Humorous Drawing at the National Caricature Salon (1987), the Grand Prize of the National Caricature Exhibition (1990 and 1994), the National Press Humour Award (1996), the Stuart Comic Strip Award (Prémio Stuart de Tira Cómica – 2005) and the Porto Cartoon World Festival Grand Prize (2008).\nA retrospective of his work was held at the Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro Museum in Lisbon in 1990 and Augusto Cid - O Cavaleiro do Cartoon was put on at the National Press Museum in Porto in 2004, which was accompanied by a catalogue written by Cid. A retrospective exhibition of his cartoons and caricatures was presented in 2023–24 at Casa Sommer in Cascais, entitled History(s) of Portugal in Cartoon: Augusto Cid: 1941–2019. Cid left his intellectual estate to the Cascais Municipal Historical Archive in 2019, with the purpose of ensuring its preservation and public enjoyment.\n\n\n== Death ==\nCid died on 14 March 2019, after a long illness. He is buried at the Alto de São João Cemetery in Lisbon.\n\n\n== Publications ==\n\nMore than 30 books of Cid's work, or including his work, have been published.\n\nQue se passa na frente\nPREC - Processo Revolucionário Eventualmente Chocante\nPREC II\nO Superman\nEanito, el Estático\nO Último Tarzan\nO fim do PREC\nDemito-me uma Ova\nBicas e Bocas\nCamarate (1984)\nCamarate: Como, Porquê e Quem (1987)\nAgarra, Mas Não Abuses\nAlto Cão Traste\nO Produto Interno Brito\nCão Traste\nSeguros Cartoon Book\nDesculpe o Mau Jeito...\nSoares é Fish\nCartoons do Ano 1999\n25 dos 4\nCartoons do Ano 2000\nCartoons do Ano 2002\nCartoons do Ano 2003\nCartoons do Ano 2004\nAugusto Cid: O Cavaleiro do Cartoon\nO Fenómeno\nCartoons do Ano 2005\nCartoons do Ano 2006\nCartoons do Ano 2007\nCartoons do Ano 2008\nPorreiro, Pá!\nCartoons do Ano 2009\nCartoons do Ano 2010\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nA Day with Augusto Cid, programme on RTP television\n Media related to Augusto Cid at Wikimedia Commons",

Stretching from Bank Road at Khayaban-e-Iqbal to Khyaban-e-Saadi, the channel is linked with the sea, connecting through Boat Basin.\nThe water flow of Nehr-e-Khayyam is bidirectionally: during low tide, water moves from the ground to the sea, while during high tide, it reverses course, flowing from the sea back to the ground.\n\n\n== Development ==\nDespite its original purpose of draining rainwater into the sea, and first plans as a 'recreational zone' in the 1970s, Nehr-e-Khayyam has, over the decades, become a focal point of urban interest for environmental reasons. The channel is plagued by heavy pollution, filled with garbage and sewage, a stark contrast to its location in the densely populated and upscale neighbourhood of Clifton.\nNumerous efforts have been made to address the pollution and enhance the aesthetic appeal of the area.\nHowever, these endeavors have been marred by challenges such as broken contracts, unclear responsibilities, and financial discrepancies, resulting in unresolved legal disputes awaiting adjudication in courts.\nBeyond issues of pollution and degraded water quality, scientific studies have highlighted the pervasive presence of bacteria within the channel, all which eventually flow through the Chinna Creek into the Arabian Sea.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of water supply and sanitation\nSanitation",

        "content": "Matti Kuusela (born 12 June 1956) is a retired Finnish journalist. He worked for Aamulehti for nearly 40 years. Kuusela received many journalism awards in his career. In 2024, Kuusela revealed in his autobiography, that he has written self-invented material in his articles.\n\n\n== Career ==\nKuusela started his career in 1981 and worked as a regular journalist for Aamulehti from 1983 to 2020, when he retired. After this, Kuusela worked as an occasional assistant for Iltalehti. Kuusela worked as a sports reporter, editor of the Sunday pages and from 2000 as a culture journalist.\nFor the majority of his career, Kuusela has worked with narrative journalism and reportages, travelogues, personal interviews and columns, among other things. He has received several important awards during his career, such as the Tiedonjulkistamisen valtionpalkinto, Lumilapio-award for investigative journalism, Best newspaper story of the year award by Sanomalehtien Liitto  and Bonnier's best newspaper story award. Kuusela was especially known for his reportage trips aboard, which he made to Asia, Middle East, Russia and Ukraine. Kuusela worked as a Beijing correspondent for six months in 2004.\nKuusela lives in Nokia with his wife. They have 2 adult kids.\n\n\n== Disclosure of fictitious interviews ==\nIn March 2024, it was revealed that Kuusela had written fabrication in some of his interviews with Aamulehti. He admitted in his biography Journalisti – Toisenlainen toimittaja that he used fiction in some of his articles. After the book was published, Aamulehti removed 551 articles written by Kuusela and launched an internal investigation. The investigation stated that Kuusela had used fiction in several articles made at different times. Determing the total amount is difficult.\nKuusela denies that he distorted the statements of the interviewees. He says that he used exaggeration, sarcasm and amusement as stylistic devices. According to Kuusela, readers should understand that not all articles are completely true. A complaint has been made to the Council for Mass Media in Finland.\nMatti Apunen was the editor-in-chief of Aamulehti between 1998 and 2010. He has defended Kuusela's experimental style and has said he understand the context in which the stories have been published. Apunen says that there should be room for experimentation and play in journalism, as long as the context is clear. According to Apunen, the limits are absolute in news articles, but an experimental body text is a different matter.\nIn May 2023, Iltalehti had to remove 33 articles about the Russian invasion of Ukraine from its website. The magazine's investigation raised unethical concerns in the assistants activities, such as the misuse of images at different times and places. This also raised doubts about the truthfulness of the information in other stories.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hermann Anthony Cornelius Weber (born December 17, 1822, in Hamburg; † September 9, 1886 in Othmarschen near Altona) was a Hamburg senator and mayor.\n\n\n== Family ==\nWeber's family originally came from Bielefeld. His father, David Friedrich Weber, together with Carl Woermann's father, founded the business Woermann und Weber in Bielefeld in 1811, which dealt with the linen trade.

        "content": "\"Who I Am\" is song by Norwegian music producer and DJ Alan Walker, Norwegian singer Peder Elias and Indonesian singer Putri Ariani, released as a single on 4 January 2020\n4 through MER.\n\n\n== Background ==\nPutri Ariani is an Indonesian singer-songwriter, who won Indonesia's Got Talent and finished 4th place on America's Got Talent. She also performed the song \"Not You\" live with Alan Walker (which was popular in Indonesia). Inspired by her story, Walker decided she would be ideal for the song he was working on, about his own journey as an artist.\nThe song was released, with Peder Elias and Putri Ariani also joining a Discord podcast. The main drop samples a song from the 1955 Norwegian film Karius og Baktus, written by Christian Hartmann (which also has songwriting credits). It uses a similar style to On My Way, also featuring orchestral elements.\nWalker has this to say about the song: \"When I first started releasing music, I kept it mostly to myself. I found sharing my songs with others intimidating and I feared not \"fitting in the crowd\" with my style of music. Mom and Dad always taught me to be true to myself and follow my heart. Even if that meant going against the current sometimes.. Together with some amazing people, I decided to write a song about this.\" He continued, “'Who I Am' is a song about being true to yourself and following your heart. A little over 10 years ago, my heart was with music. And I'm so glad I found the courage to pursue it. Hope you do the same.\"\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nOldTimeMusic.com said that Who I Am is about \"Breaking free from social expectations,\" and Kumparan said that Who I Am had \"motivating lyrics.\"\n\n\n== Music Video ==\nThe music video was released on January 20, two weeks after the song's release. Set in Walkerworld, the AVI-8 drone will show moments in Walker's life from his childhood to his current career. Video submissions from fans will also be solicited, some of which can be viewed. The music video has been viewed more than 20 million times as of March 2024.\n\n\n== Restrung version ==\nOn 29 February 20204, Walker published an restrung version of the song called \"Who I Am (Restrung Performance Version)\". The song retains the build-up elements of the original, but Walker removes them to create a galloping folk-like rhythm enhanced by the string section and vocal choir.\nThe Restrung version of the video, uploaded by Walker's YouTube account on February 24, has been viewed over 9 million times as of March 2024, with over 500,000 likes and more than 40,000 comments. In this music video, Alan Walker, Putri Ariani, and Peder Elias sing against the backdrop of Norway's Andalsnes Mountains, accompanied by other musicians. Walker says in a statement about the video: \"It almost feels surreal that just 10 days ago, we were standing on the mountain tops in Norway to shoot this video. I was prepared for the Norwegian winter, but the gusts of wind on the first day of filming were intense! Poor Putri came from 35 degrees in Indonesia. Fortunately, it calmed down, and we ended up with an incredibly beautiful product, and not least and amazing experience.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Miladin Ivanović (Serbian Cyrillic: Миладин Ивановић; 23 December 1941–13 March 1999), known as Mile, was a Serbian medical doctor, politician, and administrator. During the 1990s, he was the mayor of Peć, the leader of the Peć District, and a member of Serbian and Yugoslavian parliaments. Ivanović was a member of the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) and an ally of Slobodan Milošević. \n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nIvanović was born to a Kosovo Serb family in Peć during World War II, in what was then the Italian Zone of Occupation in Kosovo, part of the larger Italian protectorate of Albania. After the war, he was raised in the Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija in the People's Republic of Serbia, Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. He graduated from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Medicine and practiced as a radiologist.\nMatthew McAllester's Beyond the Mountains of the Damned (2003) includes an assertion that Ivanović was known in Peć even before the start of his political career for refusing to treat Kosovo Albanian patients, and quotes an Albanian resident of the city describing him as \"a bigot and a nationalist.\"\n\n\n== Politician ==\nBeyond the Mountains of the Damned describes Ivanović as having been the most powerful politician in Peć during the 1990s, a political boss who derived his local authority from his alliance with Milošević. A 1992 article in Der Spiegel described him as presiding over a harsh system of justice directed at the Albanian community, and the same article referred to him as \"a pleasure-lover, a conversation partner with exquisite politeness and an ardent patriot, but also a man of power and a chauvinist when it comes to the big things - history and future of the Serbian people.\"\n\n\n=== Administrator of the Peć District ===\nThere is conflicting information online as to when Ivanović served as administrator of the Peć District, but he at least held the position in the years immediately after the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was established, from 1992 to 1994. He was a member of the Socialist Party's central committee in the same period.\n\n\n=== Parliamentarian (1993–99) ===\nIvanović appeared in the fourth position on the Socialist Party's electoral list for Priština in the 1992 Serbian parliamentary election. From 1992 to 2000, Serbia's electoral law stipulated that one-third of parliamentary mandates would be assigned to candidates on successful lists in numerical order, with the remaining two-thirds distributed to other candidates at the discretion of the sponsoring parties or coalitions. Ivanović was automatically elected to the national assembly when the Socialists won thirteen out of twenty-four seats in the division. In the term that followed, he was a member of the health committee and the committee on relations with Serbs outside of Serbia. He was also appointed as one of the Serbian parliament's twenty representatives to the Chamber of Republics in the Yugoslavian parliament.\nThe SPS formed a minority government after the 1992 Serbian election and was dependent on informal parliamentary support from the far-right Serbian Radical Party (SRS). The alliance between these parties broke down in mid-1993, and a new Serbian parliamentary election was held in December of that year. Ivanović was given the fifth position on the SPS's list for Priština and was re-elected when the list won a landslide victory with twenty-one of twenty-four seats. The SPS emerged from the election in a stronger position overall and led a stable government in the term that followed. Ivanović held the same committee assignments as before, although in this term the Health Committee was renamed as the Committee on Health, Demographic Policy, and Family. He was not reappointed to the Yugoslavian parliament.\nSerbia's electoral divisions were restructured prior to the 1997 parliamentary election. Ivanović led the SPS's list for Peć and was elected to a third term in the national assembly when the list won twelve out of fourteen seats. The SPS formed a new coalition government with the Radical Party and the Yugoslav Left (JUL) after the election, and Ivanović continued to serve as a government supporter. (Before the coalition government was formed, Radical Party delegate Dragan Todorović accused Ivanović of using strong-arm tactics to ensure the Socialist Party's victory in Peć and suggested that he deserved a prison sentence for his actions.)\n\n\n=== Mayor of Peć ===\nThe Socialist Party won an overwhelming victory in Peć in the 1996 Serbian local elections, with most SPS candidates winning election unopposed. Ivanović served as the community's mayor after the election. His term in office coincided with the early stages of the 1998–99 Kosovo War. In December 1998, Kosovo Verification Mission leader William G. Walker sent Ivanović a message of condolence after six Serbs were killed by masked gunmen in a Peć café.\nIvanović closed the independent radio station BKTV on 6 May 1997, after the station rejected his demand to stop broadcasting news content.\n\n\n== Death ==\nIvanović died of natural causes on 13 March 1999, just before the beginning of the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Cancer diagnosis in the British royal family in 2024, marked the cancer diagnosis of Catherine, Princess of Wales and Charles III.\nIn February 2024, the Buckingham palace confirmed that Charles III, King of the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms had cancer. After recovering from major abdominal surgery, the princess of Wales Revealed She had cancer.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\n\n=== Catherine's diagnosis ===\nIn January 2024, Kensington Palace announced that, Catherine had been admitted at the London Clinic and had  undergone planned abdominal surgery.\nAfter recovering from the surgery, Catherine, Princess of Wales announced through a personal video message, that her post operation diagnosis confirmed that she had cancer and that she had begun preventative chemotherapy.\n\n\n==== Statement ====\nI wanted to take this opportunity to say thank you, personally, for all the wonderful messages of support and for your understanding whilst I have been recovering from surgery.\nIt has been an incredibly tough couple of months for our entire family, but I've had a fantastic medical team who have taken great care of me, for which I am so grateful.\nIn January, I underwent major abdominal surgery in London and at the time, it was thought that my condition was non-cancerous. The surgery was successful. However, tests after the operation found cancer had been present. My medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventative chemotherapy and I am now in the early stages of that treatment.\nThis of course came as a huge shock, and William and I have been doing everything we can to process and manage this privately for the sake of our young family.\nAs you can imagine, this has taken time. It has taken me time to recover from major surgery in order to start my treatment. But, most importantly, it has taken us time to explain everything to George, Charlotte and Louis in a way that is appropriate for them, and to reassure them that I am going to be ok.\nAs I have said to them; I am well and getting stronger every day by focusing on the things that will help me heal, in my mind, body and spirits.\nHaving William by my side is a great source of comfort and reassurance too. As is the love, support and kindness that has been shown by so many of you. It means so much to us both.\nWe hope that you will understand that, as a family, we now need some time, space and privacy while I complete my treatment. My work has always brought me a deep sense of joy and I look forward to being back when I am able, but for now I must focus on making a full recovery.\n\nAt this time, I am also thinking of all those whose lives have been affected by cancer. For everyone facing this disease, in whatever form, please do not lose faith or hope You are not alone.\n\n\n=== Charles III's diagnosis ===\n\n\n== Reaction on Cancer diagnosis ==\n\nFollowing the cancer diagnosis of Charles III, the reactions came all over the world. British prime minister, Rishi Sunak wished the Monarch a \" full and speedy recovery\".\nFollowing the diagnosis, Charles's younger son Prince Harry returned to london to visit his father. Harry following the visit said that, \"I jumped on a plane and went to go see him as soon as I could\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Od Čega Sam Ja\" (English: What Am I Made Of) is a song by Croatian pop singer Jelena Rozga. The song was written and produced by Ivan Huljić while the arrangement was finalized together with Leo Škaro and Darko Dimitrov. The song had its premiere  on 22 March 2024 when it was released as a single. It is a ballad which discusses the female protagonist's strengths and weaknesses, both of which seem to amaze her. \nA music video for the song, directed by Miloš Šarović and released on the same day as the song, portrays Rozga, dressed in black, in several artistic scenes, including holding a burning newspaper, performing a choreography backed by dancing singers and in various rooms while singing the song. As of April 2022, the video has more than 650.000 views on the video streaming platform YouTube. For the week ending 25 March 2024, \"Od čega sam ja\" debuted at number 9 on the Croatian HR Top 40.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn 22 March 2024, Rozga released the single \"Od čega Sam Ja\", written and produced by Ivan Huljić while arranged by him and Leo Škaro and Darko Dimitrov. Lyrically, the song discusses both the strengths and the weaknesses of a wounded woman who seems to be amazed at the fact that she can overcome the obstacles on her path. The song marks Rozga's first fast-tempo song in the streak of songs released.\nRozga first teased the song to her fans on 19 March along with a shot from its music video posted on her official Instagram account. In the video's description, she shared the song's lyrics \"Sve puca, a ja cijela ostala\" (English: Everything is falling apart and I am still whole). Upon the release, the excerpt video received numerous positive comments from her fanbase. Afterwards, she announced it would be released on 22 March 2024 again, alongside excerpts. \nAlongside the release, Rozga wrote the following passage about the song's conception: \"It is always good to work with someone, who, one could say you know to the soul and that they know how important it is to stay faithful to yourself. I enjoyed in the entire process of making this song, from the first recorded melodies to the end of the filming of the music video which I find to be a real visual dessert and I cannot wait to hear the reactions of my fanbase\".\n\n\n== Music video ==\nA music video for the song premiered on 22 March, directed by Miloš Šarović. NN media served as the production company led by producer Aleksandar Pejčić. It features artistic shots of Rozga singing the song to the camera including her in front of a beam of light in a dark foggy room, surrounded by dancers, her in a  space surrounded by red flower leaves and singing the song to the camera while holding a burning newspaper in her hands which features the headline \"Od Čega Sam\". In other scenes, she is also seen lying on the floor together with numerous backing dancers with several flowers in their arms. In most scenes, she is seen dressed in black with a black hat on her head. A naked male model can be also seen in the clip as Rozga is seen approaching him during some scenes. Towards the bridge and final chorus, Rozga sings the song while completely surrounded by flames. As of April 2024, the video has more than 650.000 views on YouTube.\n\n\n== Charts ==\nFor the week ending 25 March 2024, \"Od čega sam ja\" debuted at number 9 on the Croatian HR Top 40, which also marked the highest entry on the chart for that week.\n\n\n== Credits ==\nCredits for \"Od čega sam ja\" are adopted from the official music video's YouTube description.\n\nSong credits\nMusic: Ivan Huljić\nLyrics: Ivan Huljić\nMusic arrangement: Leo Škaro, Darko Dimitrov, Ivan Huljić\nMix: Leo Škaro\nMastering: Goran Martinac\nVideo credits\nDirector: Miloš Šarović\nDOP: Nemanja Novaković\nProducer: Aleksandar Pejčić\nProduction: NN media\nOrganizer: Sofija Petković\n1st AD: Rale Obrenov\nEditor: Marija Šarac\nVfx: Andrija Grkić\nScenography: Orjen Djurić\nColor correction: Nikola Marinković\nFocus puller: Miodrag Todorović\nGaffer: Miloš Vučenović\nGrips: Ivan Leković Garac\nChoreographer: Jelena Bulatović\nDancers: Jelena Bulatović, Tamara Pjević, Andrea Dobrić, Natalija Djikanovic\nModel: Marko Kraljević\nStylist (Jelena Rozga): Miloš Oks\nMUA (Jelena Rozga): Saša Joković\nMUA (models): Irena Miletić\nHair stylist (Jelena Rozga): Maja Stanišić\nHair stylist (models): Maja Stanišić\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Han Xin code (汉信码 in Chinese, Chinese-sensible code) is two-dimensional (2D) matrix barcode symbology invented in 2007 by Chinese company The Article Numbering Center of China (中国物品编码中心 in Chinese) to break monopoly of QR code. As QR code, Han Xin code consists of black squares and white square spaces arranged in a square grid on a white background. It has four finder patterns and other markers which allow to recognize it with camera-based readers. Han Xin code contains Reed–Solomon error correction with ability to read corrupted images. At this time, it is issued as ISO/IEC 20830:2021.The main advantage (and invention requirement), comparable to QR code, is an embedded ability to natively encode Chinese characters instead of Japanese in QR code. Han Xin code in maximal 84 version (189×189 size) allows to encode 7827 numeric characters, 4350 English text characters, 3261 bytes and 1044–2174 Chinese characters (it depends on Unicode region). Han Xin code encodes full ISO/IEC 646 Latin characters instead of restricted amount Latin characters which is supported by QR code. It makes Han Xin code more suitable for English text encoding or GS1 Application Identifiers data encoding.\nAdditionally, Han Xin code can encode Unicode characters from other languages with special Unicode mode,: 5.4.12  which has embedded lossless compression for UTF-8 characters set and Extended Channel Interpretation support. Han Xin code has special compactification mode for URI encoding and can reduce barcode size which encodes links to web pages.\n\n\n== History and standards ==\nChinese company The Article Numbering Center of China (中国物品编码中心 in Chinese) during 10-th Five-year plans of China started research of own QR code replacement to remove Japanese monopoly in 2D barcodes. In 2007, the new barcodes standard, at this time known as Han Xin code, published as GB/T 21049-2007 with the name Chinese-sensible code.\nIn 2011, USA company Association for Automatic Identification and Mobility (AIM) brought out ISS Han Xin Code symbology as official encoding standard and published it in the own store.In 2015, group of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 31 started implementation of Han Xin code as international standard and published it as ISO/IEC 20830:2021 in 2021.\nIn 2022 Chinese-sensible code standard was reviewed as GB/T 21049-2022 and renamed as Han Xin code to be compliant with ISO standard.\nSet of patents is registered in United States Patent and Trademark Office related with Han Xin code encoding and decoding:\n\nEuropean Patent Office EP3330887B1 by Fujian Landi Commercial Equipment Co Ltd  \"Chinese-sensitive code feature pattern detection method and system\"\nUnited States Patent US10095903B2 by Ingenico Fujian Technology Co Ltd  \"Block decoding method and system for two-dimensional code\"\nUnited States Patent US10528781B2 by Ingenico Fujian Technology Co Ltd  \"Detection method and system for characteristic patterns of Han Xin codes\"\n\n\n== Application ==\nHan Xin code can be used in the same way as QR code. At this time Han Xin code is used mostly in China, because it has embedded encoding ability to encode Chinese characters. However, most of barcode printers and barcode scanners support Han Xin code. Han Xin code can be scanned on iOS and Android mobile devices and many barcode libraries support reading and writing Han Xin code.\nMain advantages of Han Xin code are:\n\nability to encode Chinese characters with embedded methods;\nExtended Channel Interpretation support;\nembedded method for compact UTF-8 encoding with embedded lossless compression;\nembedded method for URI compact encoding;\ncompact GS1 Application Identifiers data encoding comparable to QR code;\nfull ISO/IEC 646 support for compact numeric and text encoding.\n\n\n== Barcode design ==\nHan Xin code represents data in black and white square modules, where dark module is a binary one and a light module is a zero. Additionally, Han Xin code can be encoded in inverse colors,: 4.1.2  but this option in many barcode readers is disabled by default. Black and white modules are arranged into square region with sizes from 23 × 23 modules (Version 1) to 189 × 189 modules (Version 84). As QR code, Han Xin code does not have rectangular versions like DataMatrix has and this restricts usage of Han Xin code in some cases. Han Xin code version size can be calculated with the following formula:\nSize=23+(Version−1)∗2{\\displaystyle Size=23+(Version-1)*2}\nHan Xin code symbol is constructed from the following elements:: 4.2 \nQuiet Zone – is surrounding the symbol on all four sides with at least 3X size;\nFinder Pattern – consists from 4 Position Detection Patterns which is placed on all four corners of symbol and used to detect symbol position and area;\nAlignment Patterns and Assistant Alignment Patterns – is started from Version 4 and helps with the decoding of distorted code;\nStructural Information Regions – is surrounding all four Finder Patterns and used to encode symbol parameters like version, mask and error correction mode;\nData Regions – masked binary data encoded in black and white modules.\n\n\n=== Finder pattern ===\nFinder Pattern: 4.2.3  consists from four Position Detection Patterns located at the four corners of the barcode. The size of Position Detection Pattern is 7×7 modules and it is constructed from 5 elements: dark 7 × 7 modules, light 6 × 6 modules, dark 5 × 5 modules, light 4 × 4 modules, dark 3 × 3 modules respectively.\nThe scanning ratio of each Position Detection Pattern is 1:1:1:1:3 or 3:1:1:1:1 (depends on scanning direction). The four patterns orientation allows to detect unambiguously the barcode location and orientation.\nEvery pattern has Position Detection Pattern separator: 4.2.4  with Structural Information Region aligned to it.\n\n\n=== Alignment pattern ===\nThe Alignment Patterns: 4.2.5  are added to the Han Xin code from Version 4 (Versions 1–3 do not have alignment patterns) and used to precise cell position in the distorted barcodes. Alignment Patterns in Han Xin code are split into:\n\nAlignment Pattern – set of step-wise alignment lines;\nAssistant Alignment Pattern - 6 modules, including 5 light modules and 1 dark module.The Alignment Pattern is made up of a dark line and a downside adjacent light line which are one module wide. Assistant Alignment Pattern consisting from 5 light modules and 1 dark module indicates edge of region block with its dark module.\nBelow you can see examples of Han Xin code with different Alignment pattern placement.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Structural information ===\nHan Xin code Structural Information Region: 4.2.7  is a one module wide region surrounding the four Position Detection Patterns. Han Xin code has two Structural Information identical arrays, which are made from 34 data modules. Every Structural Information array is split on 17 modules which are placed around each Position Detection Pattern.\nStructural Information Region encodes the following data:: Annex E \nVersion + 20 (bits 0–7);\nError correction level (bits 8–9);\nMask index (bits 10–11);\nError correction Reed–Solomon error correction data (bits 12–27);\nBits 28–33 are ignored and can be any (sometimes they can be filled with white, black sequence).Metadata bits from 0–11 are split into 4 bits tetrads(m2, m1, m0) and supplemented with four error correction tetrads (r3, r2, r1, r0).\n\n\n=== Data masking ===\nTo make Han Xin code dark and light modules amount to be closely to 1:1 in the symbol, masking algorithm: 5.8.4  is used. Masking sequence is applied to Data Region through the XOR operation. Finder Pattern, Alignment Patterns and Structural Information Regions are excluded from masking operation. The following table shows mask pattern algorithms (which is placed to Structural Information Region).\n\ni - Row index of the symbol.\nj - Column index of the symbol.\nBoth i and j start from (1,1), the top left corner module of the symbol. When the masking solution condition is true, the resulting mask bit is 1.\n\n\n=== Error correction ===\nHan Xin code uses Reed–Solomon error correction. Encoded data is represented as byte (8-bit) array. Data array divided into blocks: Annex B  and error correction codewords sequence is generated for each block which is added to the end of the error correction block. After this, all blocks are merged sequentially into byte stream.\nThe polynomial arithmetic for Han Xin Code uses finite field generation polynomial: x^8 + x^6 + x^5 + x (355 or 101100011b): 5.5  with initial root = 1.\nThe amount of error correction codewords depends on symbol version and error correction level and can be from 16% to 60%, which allows to correct from 8% to 30% damage.: 5.6.2 \n\n\n=== Data region ===\nHan Xin code data is encoded as byte array. Data byte array is split into error correction blocks, where error correction codewords (bytes) are added. Error correction blocks are united into one codewords array:: 5.8.3 (Encoded byte array) => (Error correction block 1) + ... + (Error correction block N) => (Codewords array)\nAs an example, this can be demonstrated on Han Xin code version 5 with error correction level L4. It has 27 encoded codewords and 2 error correction blocks with each block size of data codewords and error correction codewords: (14, 20), (13, 22):\n(D1...D14, D15...D27) => (D1...D14, E1.1...1.20) + (D15...D27, E2.1...2.22) => (D1...D14, E1.1...1.20, D15...D27, E2.1...2.22) => (C1...C69)\nD(x) - Data codewords.\nE(b.x) - error codeword, where b is block number and x position in block.\nC(x) - resulted codewords.\nAs the next operation, resulted codewords array C(x) is split into blocks with size of 13 bytes which connects codewords in the same position of each block and form new codewords array. The result is byte array of the same size but mixed by position of 13.\n(С1...С13, С14...С26, Сn...Cn+12) => (С1, C14, Cn...С13, С26, Cn+12) => (CM1...CMn+12)\nCM(x) – mixed by position of 13 array of codewords (bytes).\nAfter the upper operations the resulted codewords are placed into data region row by row from left to right and from up to down. Horizontal line damage would affect fewer codewords, vertical line damage would affect more codewords.\n\n\n== Encoding ==\nHan Xin code can encode 7827 numeric characters, 4350 English text characters, 3261 bytes and 1044–2174 Chinese characters in the maximal version 84 version.: Annex C  Additionally, it supports special Unicode and industrial modes. All modes can be mixed to obtain best compactification level for the data. The following table demonstrates abilities to encode data with different barcode version and error correction level.\n\n\n=== Encoding modes ===\nAll encoding modes can be split into the following groups:: 5.3.1 \nNumeric mode which includes digits encoding: 0–9;\nText mode which supports full ISO/IEC 646 characters set;\nBinary (Byte) mode which encodes bytes values 0–255;\nChinese Characters modes which encodes 1587600 different Chinese characters from GB 18030 codepage in 4 modes;\nUnicode encoding with Extended Channel Interpretation(ECI) mode;\nUnicode with Unicode adaptive mode which encodes UTF-8 encoding with embedded lossless compression;\nGS1 mode which encodes GS1 Application Identifiers data;\nURI mode which encodes URI links in compact encoding.\n\n\n=== Numeric mode ===\nThe input data string in Numeric mode: 5.4.4  is divided into blocks of three digits (the last block can be less than three) and encoded in 10 bits (0000000000b - 1111100111b). The mode data is prefixed with mode indicator 0001b and terminates with mode terminator which also indicates number of digits in last group.\n\nAs an example, we need to encode digits sequence 12700402:\nPrefix => 0001b\n127 => 0001111111\n004 => 0000000100\n02 => 0000000010\nTerminator => 1111111110b\n\n\n=== Text mode ===\nText mode encodes data characters set from ISO/IEC 646. Each character is represented by 6 bits.: 5.4.5  All characters are divided into two subsets: Text1 sub-mode and Text2 sub-mode. 11110b value is used to switch between text sub-modes, 111111b is a mode terminator. Text mode starts from Text1 sub-mode.\n\n\n=== Binary byte mode ===\nBinary mode encodes bytes array [0 – 255] in any form. Binary mode: 5.4.6  consists from binary mode indicator 0011b, 13-bit binary counter and bytes data which are converted to 8-bit sequence. None mode terminator is required.\n\n\n=== Chinese Characters modes ===\nChinese Characters modes is a set of 4 modes which encodes Chinese characters from GB 18030 codepage.\n\n\n=== Unicode mode ===\nUnicode mode: 5.4.12  encodes UTF-8 charset with embedded lossless compression. In the Unicode mode, the input data is analysed by using self-adaptive algorithm. Firstly, input data is divided and combined into the 1, 2, 3, or 4 byte pattern preencoding sub-sequences, and secondly a run-length data compression algorithm is applied to encode each sub-sequences of the input data.\nShortly, the Unicode mode searches characters sub-pages which can have the same prefix sequence for all of characters of the same language (Cyrillic, Greek, French, German... languages) and encodes only differences from prefix bytes sequence.\n\n\n=== GS1 mode ===\nHan Xin code GS1 mode: 5.4.13  is an indicator that the represented data is defined by GS1 General Specification. GS1 mode encodes data in Numeric and Text modes. Other modes may be used but GS1 mode must be first\nmode in the symbol and encoded data must be returned with GS1 flag. <FNC1> (if required) must be encoded as 1111101000b in Numeric mode (Numeric mode encodes only three digits, so 1111101000b => 1000 value is counted as special character). In case <FNC1> identifier must be inserted and encoder is in any mode different from Numeric, the mode must be terminated and Numeric mode must be started. GS1 mode indicator is 11100001b and GS1 mode terminator is 11111111b.\nThe data in GS1 mode is split into GS1 Application Identifiers chinks and then compacted with the best modes. As an example, the following data can be encoded:\n(10)123456ABC<FNC1>(240)DATA\nThe data is encoded in the following way:\n<11100001b> <Numeric 10123456> <Text ABC> <Numeric mode selector> <1111101000b> <Numeric 240> <Text DATA> <11111111b>\n\n\n=== URI mode ===\nHan Xin code URI mode: 5.4.14  encodes URI links in compact encoding. URI mode indicator is 11100010b and URI mode terminator is 111b. URI mode can encode data in three charsets: URI-A, URI-B, URI-C: Annex M  with own sub-mode terminators. URI mode can encode %XX data in special Percent-Encoding sub-mode, where three symbols is encoded in 8 bits.\n\nPercent-Encoding sub-mode encodes %XX data in 8 bits sequence. The mode does not require any terminator. To encode URI %XX data in this mode, sub-mode indicator (100b) must be added, then 8-bit indicator of sub-mode 8 bits sequence must be added (counter = Length of %XX / 3) and after this sequence, where %FF, or %ff, or %00, must be added as xFF or x00 bytes.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAutomated identification and data capture (AIDC)\nBarcode\nExtended Channel Interpretation\nGB National Standard\nGS1\nQR code\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFree Han Xin code generator\nFree Han Xin code reader\nHan Xin code description",

        "content": "The Karkaraly (Kazakh: Қарқаралы; Russian: Каркаралинка) is a river in Karkaraly District, Karaganda Region, Kazakhstan. It is 63 kilometres (39 mi) long and has a basin of 676 km2 (261 sq mi).\nThe Karkaraly is one of the longest rivers of the Karasor Basin. The main settlements near its banks are the city of Karkaraly and Akzhol village.\n\n\n== Course ==\nThe Karkaraly has its sources in the southeastern slopes of the Karkaraly Range, central Kazakh Uplands. It is formed at the feet of the range in the confluence of the Big Karkaraly (Ulken Karkaraly) and Little Karkaraly (Kishi Karkaraly) rivers. It heads roughly northwards leaving the mountains to the west. A certain distance north of Akzhol it makes a wide bend heading first northwestwards and then westwards. In its lower reaches it divides into branches and flows among small lakes and clayey areas encrusted with salt. Finally the Karkaraly  enters a bay located on the southern shore of lake Karasor.\nThe valley is wide and the river channel is steep in the upper course, becoming flat in the final stretch, where it flows among meadows and willow thickets. The Karkaraly river is fed by snow and groundwater. Usually it is at its highest level in mid April, with the melting of the snows. The Karkaraly stays frozen between November and early to mid April.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of rivers of Kazakhstan\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Pambattam (transl. Snake dance) is a 2024 Indian Tamil-language horror thriller film directed by V. C. Vadivudaiyan and starring himself, Jeevan, Mallika Sherawat, Rittika Sen, and Saipriya Deva. The film was released after a four-year delay to highly negative reviews. The film was dubbed in Hindi as Naagmati which had a direct television release on Zee Cinema prior to the release of Tamil version on 21 September 2023.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film began production in January of 2020 and Jeevan accepted the film after listening to three of V. C. Vadivudaiyan's scripts. This film marked his comeback to films after a five-year gap. The film was planned as a multilingual film with the Hindi version titled as Naagmati. Mallika Sherawat plays a queen in the film, which marks her return to Tamil cinema after a twelve-year gap. Sherawat joined the sets in February 2021 during the second schedule and shot some of her dialogues in Hindi. A dungeon set was made at Binny Mills in Chennai. The stunts were choreographed by Super Subbarayan. Jeevan sustained several injuries including burns from torches falling in a narrow passage and a hairline muscle tear from falling through gaps between beds while rolling sideways on the ground. At the film's trailer launch, Saipriya Deva said that she signed the film as a heroine but lamented about how her name was disregarded from promotional material.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nA critic from The Times of India rated the film 1+1⁄2 out of 5 and wrote that \"The overall vibe of Pambattam is jaded and even comical. The scenes that are supposed to be pretty serious, like a marriage by abduction and even the death of one of the important characters, just don't make you feel any kind of emotion\". A critic from Dinakaran wrote that the director delivered the film in the old formula of telling a historical story and then combining it with a social story. A critic from Zee Tamil wrote that since it is a small budget film, they did not spend much on CG scenes, and it would have turned out to be a better film if only a little attention had been paid to it.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPambattam at IMDb",

The name, although referring to both cities, was often applied by geographers to either one in isolation. The cities were Tabas al-Tamr ('Tabas of the Dates'), also known as Tabas Gilaki after a famous governor of the city who had pacified the region, and Tabas al-Unnab ('Tabas of the Jujube') or Tabas Masinan. Alternatively, the term might refer to Tabas al-Tamr and the nearby village of Kuri or Kurin, which was fortified and is called \"one of the two fortresses of Taban\" by the 9th-century geographer al-Baladhuri.\nThe district was strategically important, being located immediately east of the Great Salt Desert; Tabas al-Tamr was called the 'Gate of Khurasan' by al-Baladhuri.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nLe Strange, Guy (1905).

        "content": "Benedict Lombe is a writer of Congolese-British heritage. She is based in London and was born in Kinshasa.\nShe is the writer of two acclaimed plays, Lava and Shifters, both of which received their premieres at the Bush Theatre. Lava, a one-woman play starring Ronkẹ Adékoluẹjo and directed by Anthony Simpson-Pike, opened at the Bush in 2021. It went on to win the 2022 Susan Smith Blackburn Prize - the oldest and largest prize honouring women+ playwrights writing for English-speaking theatre. Lombe thus became one of the first playwrights to win the prize for a debut play. Lava also won prizes at the Black British Theatre Awards and the 2022 Offies, and it was nominated for the Alfred Fagon Award for Best New Play of the Year. Lombe's next play Shifters, a two-hander romance starring Tosin Cole and Heather Agyepong, directed by Lynette Linton, opened in 2024 to widespread acclaim from UK theatre press.\nAmong Lombe's writing influences are Lynn Nottage, debbie tucker green and Paula Vogel.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sadun Artsruni, also Sadun of Mankaberd (Georgian: სადუნ მანკაბერდელი; Armenian: Սադուն Բ Արծրունի) of the House of the Artsrunids, was an Armenian prince, Prince of Haghbat and Mankaberd. He was a court official and became Atabeg (Governor General) and Amirspasalar (Commander-in-Chief of the army) of the Kingdom of Eastern Georgia, and later chamberlain of Avag's daughter Khoshak. He was concurrently \"Prime Minister\" of the Mongol Il-Khan Abaqa.\nSadun was a great-grandson of Amir K'urd (Abulasan), governor of Tbilisi during Queen Tamar's reign in Georgia. In 1258, Sadun won a wrestling match in front of the Mongol ruler Hulegu, who gave him the title of t'arkhan. Sadun then accompanied Hulegu in his military campaigns in Syria in 1259, in the conquest of Sasun, and in the capture of the citadel of Aleppo. He was then awarded the district of Sasun from Hulegu.\nThroughout the 13th century, the high offices Atabeg (Governor General) and Amirspasalar (Commander-in-Chief of the Georgian army) had been held by the Zakarids, but following the Mongol invasions of Georgia the Mongol victors gave these offices to the \"renegade\" Sadun of Mankaberd in 1272. When Abaqa became the new Mongol ruler, Sadun received from him the title of Atabeg Amirspasalar for the Georgian Bagratid Kingdom. He was said to be close to the Mongols, and had been promoted by them: \"Sadun Artsruni was appointed as atabeg of Georgia by Abaqa Khan\". In his position, he especially controlled the policies of Eastern Georgia, which, while being ruled by Demetre II, remained pro-Mongol throughout. Sadun was also awarded control of the royal domains of T'elavi, Belakani and Kars, and acquired Dmanisi from Dimitri II. His estate in Georgian Armenia was next to that of the Zakarids.\nThe rise of Sadun examplifies the way the Mongol maintained control over the Georgian territory, by maintaining the original kingship within the original Bagratid family, through the offices of the atabegi and the amir-spasarali, given to those who were collaborating with them.\nHe was an acquaintance of Shams al-Din Juvayni, a vizier in the service of the Mongols, and organized his marriage with Khoshak, daughter of Avag Zakarian, whom he had had under his supervision.\nSadun married the daughter of Xoja Aziz, a powerful Persian official active in the administration of Georgia.\nSadun died in 1282, and his title of Amirspasalar was transmitted to his son Khutlu-Bugha. However, Demetrius II of Georgia blocked Sadun's son Khutlubuga from getting the office of atabeg, and instead promoted Tarsaich Orbelian of the Orbelians.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nKitagawa, Sei-ichi'.

It was spun off as an independent firm after Y Combinator China was closed. It is one of the largest startup accelerators in China.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 2018, Y Combinator (YC) established a unit in China known as YC China. It was led by Lu Qi, a former executive who had worked at Microsoft and Baidu.\nIn November 2019 affected by the China–United States trade war, YC announced that it would be closing YC China. It stated it would revert to its original strategy of supporting companies from its Silicon Valley headquarters.\nLu and the members of YC China then established MiraclePlus as an independent firm. It had already start fundraising six months prior to YCs formal announcement when it was still part of YC and had opened its first startup incubation program in China. The format was similar to YC but had a more localized operation.\nIn Spring 2020, MiraclePlus held its second incubation program which differed from its first one as it was run under the MiraclePlus brand rather than YC. The program also asked startups to stipulate \"Why now?\" in their pitches which was different from the approach at YC. According to Lu, it had 20% more applicants than the first one.\nMiraclePlus' first fund had received $55 million in funding at the end of October 2019 according to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. After MiraclePlus became independent it continued to acquire funding with its investors including Sequoia Capital, University of Michigan and Liu Qiangdong.\nAccording to Lu, the aims of the incubation program is to accelerate product-market fit and to help startup companies survive longer.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "The House-Museum of Dmytro Yavornytsky (Ukrainian: Меморіальний будинок-музей Дмитра Яворницького) is a historic house museum of the academician Dmytro Yavornytsky in the city of Dnipro, Ukraine. The building is one of the Dmytro Yavornytsky National Historical Museum of Dnipro's collection. Additionally, it is the only historic Katerynoslav (present day Dnipro) residential estate still standing.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe mezzanine, living room, dining room, study, foyer, and hall of Yavornytsky's home were all furnished exactly as they were when he lived there in the 1930s. Poplar and pine trees Yavornytsky planted, still stands in front of the home.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the present-day Taras Shevchenko Park, it was constructed in 1905 in accordance with the design of architect Leonid Brodnytsky across from the Potemkin Palace. For thirty-five years, Yavornytsky, a well-known Ukrainian archaeologist, historian, and public personality, lived and worked in this red brick home featuring a carved wooden veranda and a belvedere.\nYavornytskyi cleared new ground in every facet of Ukrainian culture throughout his lifetime. Following his passing, his second wife Serafima Dmitrivna wrote to the municipal executive committee requesting that a museum be established in his home. However, this was not feasible since the Second World War broke out, and the house was taken over by German occupiers\nAt the war's conclusion, the decision to establish a memorial museum was reiterated; yet, the home served as the historical museum's funding source up to the 1960s. The house was closed for repairs in the 1970s because it was in poor condition. In addition, the decision was made in 1982 to establish a Dmytro Ivanovych Evarnytsky memorial museum. 3 November 1988 marked the opening of the memorial house.\nThe museum hosts exhibits, concerts, scientific conferences, master seminars on ornamental and practical art, themed excursions, creative encounters with notable individuals from the city and Ukraine in general. Since 2007, the house has featured an exhibition area where guests may learn about themed displays pertaining to Yavornytsky's life and accomplishments.\nOn 17 July 2023, the museum offers an array of enriching master classes tailored for schoolchildren, covering a range of activities including embroidery, straw-weaving, Petrykivka painting, papercutting, penmanship, beadwork, and more. The master classes are available throughout the year. On 8 April, the National Museum-Preserve \"Battle for Kyiv in 1943\" hosted a sizable event to commemorate the anniversary of the territory's liberation at the house, with several items from the Russian Invasion of Ukraine, including Battle of Irpin, was among the event exhibitions.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nNumerous memorabilia are on display at the show, including student notebooks from his time spent studying in the Kharkiv gymnasium, workbooks that included his personal belongings, papers, letters, photos, and paintings. Among personal items are spectacles, a stick, an embroidered blouse, and many more.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVirtual tour of the house",

In 1926 the sister company Ilektriki Etaireia Metaforon or H.E.M., also part of Power Group, took over the 1,000 mm (3 ft 3+3⁄8 in) metre gauge Lavrion Square-Strofyli railway. This line was eventually converted to standard gauge, double track and became an extension of the existing line, reaching Attiki in 1948 and Kifissia in 1958.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Benjamin Gooch (1707-8 – February 1776) was an English physician and surgeon. Gooch's splint is named after him.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGooch was probably the son of Benjamin Gooch (d. 1728), rector of Ashwellthorpe, Norfolk, and his wife Anne Phyllis (d. 1701). He practised chiefly at Shotesham in Norfolk. He was appointed surgeon to the infirmary there by the founder, William Fellowes. In 1758 he published ‘Cases and Practical Remarks in Surgery,’ 8vo, London; re-issued as ‘A Practical Treatise on Wounds and other Chirurgical Subjects; to which is prefixed a short Historical Account of … Surgery and Anatomy,’ 2 vols. 8vo, Norwich, 1767. An appendix was called ‘Medical and Chirurgical Observations,’ 8vo, Lond., 1773. A collective edition of his works appeared in 3 vols. 8vo, Lond., 1792. Before 1759, at the request of Thomas Hayter, bishop of Norwich, Gooch visited all the great hospitals in London in order to observe their working, and his reports were of great service to the committee of the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital, which opened in 1771. On 9 October 1771, Gooch was chosen consulting surgeon to the hospital. Some surgical cases communicated by him to the Royal Society are in the ‘Philosophical Transactions’ (vols. lix. lxv.).\n\n\n== References ==\nSpecific\n\nGeneral\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Goodwin, Gordon (1890). \"Gooch, Benjamin\".

        "content": "Albert Augustus Gore  (1840 – 10 March 1901) was an Irish surgeon-general.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGore born at Limerick in 1840, was eldest son of William Ringrose Gore, M.D., by his wife, Mary Jeners Wilson. He was educated in London, Paris, and Dublin, taking honours in science and medicine at Queen's College, Cork, in 1858, graduating M.D. at the Queen's University, Ireland, and being admitted L.R.C.S., Ireland, in 1860. He joined the army medical staff in 1861, and was appointed assistant surgeon to the 16th lancers. When the regimental service was reduced he volunteered for service in West Africa, and took part in the bombardment and destruction of the Timni town of Massougha, on the Sierra Leone river, on 10 December 1861, the attack on Madoukia on 27 December, and the storming and capture of the stockaded fetish town of Rohea on 28 December. He was mentioned in general orders for his services and for bravery in bringing in a wounded officer. In 1868, he was recommended for promotion on account of services rendered during an epidemic of yellow fever at Sierra Leone. He acted as sanitary officer to the quartermaster-general's staff during the Ashanti war in 1873, and was severely wounded in the action of 3 November near Dunquah, and again at Quarman on 17 November. After six years' service at various base hospitals and as principal medical officer of the army of occupation in Egypt (1882), Gore was appointed principal medical officer north-west district, Mhow division, central India, and afterwards in a similar position to the forces in India. In this capacity he was responsible for the medical arrangements of the Chitral and North-West Frontier campaigns of 1896 and 1897. He retired from the army in 1898, was made C.B. in 1899, and was granted a distinguished service pension.\nHe died at his residence, Dodington Lodge, Whitchurch, Shropshire, on 10 March 1901. He married in 1866 Rebecca, daughter of John White, by whom he had two sons and two daughters.\nGore was author of: \n\n‘A Medical History of our West African Campaigns,’ 1876.\n‘The Story of our Service under the Crown,’ 1879.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Power, D'Arcy (1912). \"Gore, Albert Augustus\".

        "content": "Richard Griffith (1635? – September 1691) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGriffith was born about 1635, was educated at Eton, though not on the foundation. On the recommendation of Cromwell and the council of state, he was appointed by the parliamentary visitors to a fellowship at University College, Oxford, on 1 September 1654 (Register, Camd. Soc. p. 399). He graduated B.A. 7 July 1657, M.A. 3 May 1660, and had thoughts of becoming a preacher, but ‘being not minded to conform he left the college, and applied his mind to the study of physic’ (Wood, Fasti Oxon., ed. Bliss, ii. 198, 224). He took the degree of M.D. at Caen in Normandy on 12 June 1664, was admitted an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in the following December, and having been created a fellow by the charter of James II, was admitted as such on 12 April 1687. He was censor in 1688 and 1690, and registrar for 1690. For some years he practised at Richmond, Surrey, but died in the parish of St. Nicholas Acons, London, in September 1691 (Probate Act Book, P.C.C.1691,f.152), and was buried in the church of Datchet, Buckinghamshire, near his deceased wife and child. In his will, dated on 4 Sept. 1691, and proved on the 8th (P.C.C. 138, Vere), he mentions property at various places in Surrey and houses in Old Street, St. Luke's, London. He married, first by license dated 18 Jan. 1678–9, Miss Jane Wheeler of Datchet (Chester, London Marriage Licences, ed. Foster, col. 591). By her, who died in 1680 (Letters of Administration, P.C.C., 7 June 1680), he had a son Richard, baptised at Richmond on 13 March 1679-80 (parish register), and buried with his mother at Datchet. His second wife, Mary, daughter of Richard Blackman, apparently of Punchins, near Stoke-next-Guildford, Surrey, survived him without issue. Griffith was the author of a somewhat venomous treatise entitled ‘A-la-Mode Phlebotomy no good fashion; or the copy of a Letter to Dr. [Francis] Hungerford [of Reading], complaining of…the phantastick behaviour and unfair dealing of some London physitians… Whereupon a fit occasion is taken to discourse of the profuse way of Blood-Letting,’ &c, 8vo, London, 1681. The immediate cause of Griffith's wrath was the supercilious treatment recommended by a London physician (formerly a 'journeyman' to Dr. Willis), who on being summoned to see an aged lady patient of his at Richmond, insisted on her being let blood, which no doubt accelerated her death. Wood (loc. cit.), followed by Harwood (Alumni Eton. p. 229), confuses Griffith with another Richard Griffith, a native of Abinger, Surrey, who passed from Eton to King's College, Cambridge, in 1629, and died in college at the close of 1642 (cf. Addit. (Cole) MS. 5816, ff. 121, 174).\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Goodwin, Gordon (1890). \"Griffith, Richard (1635?-1691)\".

        "content": "Multiclavula mucida is a globally distributed species of basidiolichen belonging to the family Hydnaceae. Since its initial classification by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon in 1797, the species has been described under various synonyms and associated with multiple genera. Persoon described its fruiting bodies as gregarious (i.e. growing in groups but separate at the base), varying from simple to branching structures, predominantly whitish in colour with yellow to brownish tips. He also noted its frequent appearance in autumn on decaying, moist wood, often covered with a greenish crust necessary for its growth.\nThe cosmopolitan distribution of Multiclavula mucida and its variability in appearance have led to a complex nomenclature and historical confusion with other species and genera. Though widespread, it is considered rare in Europe and faces threats in many countries. It can be distinguished from similar species such as Multiclavula petricola, M. vernalis, M. coronilla, and Clavicorona taxophila by differences in basidiospore size, growth substrate, fruiting body structure, and microscopic features, despite similarities in colour and general form.\n\n\n== Systematics ==\n\n\n=== Historical taxonomy ===\nThe fungus was first formally described by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon in 1797, as Clavaria mucida. Persoon characterised the fungus as gregarious, small, and either simple or branching. He noted its autumnal appearance on decaying, moist tree trunks covered with a crust or green powder, sometimes extending over a wide area. He described each specimen of the species as small and slender, occurring in both simple and more frequently in branched forms. The initial growth stage is marked by a thickened, wrinkled, and slightly curved apex. In branched specimens, the structure divides into thin, diverging, sharp branches originating from the middle or base. Persoon described the flesh as fleshy but not very tenacious, primarily whitish with the tip of the fungus being more intensely ochre in simpler forms, growing on a thin, whitish substrate or tomentum. He questioned the unique nature of the greenish crust common to this species, noting that it seemed necessary for its growth but disappeared when dried. Additionally, Persoon considered whether what he considered related species, Ramaria ornithopodoides and Clavaria albida, due to their significant size and branching nature, should be classified together with Clavaria mucida or recognised as distinct species.\nThe fungus has acquired several synonyms as a result of having been transferred to different genera in its taxonomic history. After its initial placement in Clavaria, it has been proposed for transfer to Typhula (by Elias Fries in 1827), Calocera (Richard Wettstein, 1886), Pistillaria (Julien Noël Costantin and Léon Marie Dufour, 1891), Lentaria (E. J. H. Corner, 1950), and Stichoclavaria (Eckehard Paechnatz, 1987). American mycologist Ron Petersen, in a 1967 publication transferred the taxon to the newly circumscribed genus Multiclavula in 1967. Before Corner's 1950 monograph on clavarioid fungi, little attention was given to hyphal structure and morphology in their taxonomy. Despite Corner's extensive literature compilation, he couldn't inspect many type specimens, leading to reliance on past reports for species reclassification. During Petersen's study of Clavulinopsis and comparing it to species in Lentaria's subgenus Lentariopsis as defined by Corner, it became clear that several species across both genera could be congeneric. Corner himself was uncertain about the internal relationships within Lentaria, particularly about the evolutionary connections between its species and those in the Ramaria stricta series. This ambiguity led Petersen to reevaluate the genera housing these fungi.\n\n\n=== Current classification ===\nThe reclassification of Multiclavula mucida was influenced by comparative analyses with other genera of lichen-forming fungi. While Clavulinopsis species are mostly terrestrial, characterised by white, thin- to slightly thick-walled spores and monomitic hyphae (a type of fungal tissue composed of uniformly structured hyphae), M. mucida has distinctive traits. Similarly, Lentaria, particularly exemplified by L. surculus, contrasts with M. mucida due to its predominantly lignicolous nature and thicker-walled hyphae. Despite these differences, the species within Lentaria have been subdivided into two distinct groups, neither of which aligns with Corner's subgenera, which indicated the necessity for a new genus classification.\nThis reevaluation, spurred by inconsistencies and the unique characteristics of the C. mucida group, led to significant taxonomic revisions. Historical classifications that placed C. mucida within various genera were reexamined. Petersen's review of relevant type specimens, particularly those related to Lentariopsis, concluded that the subgenus should be amalgamated with Lentaria. This consolidation and the unique aspects of C. mucida facilitated the establishment of Multiclavula as a distinct genus, addressing both phylogenetic and morphological disparities.\n\n\n=== Etymology and vernacular names ===\nThe species epithet mucida is from the Latin word mucidum, meaning \"mouldy\" or \"slimy\"; the genus name Multiclavula means \"many clubs\". In North American literature, this fungus is known by several vernacular names, including \"scum lover\", \"common club mushroom lichen\", \"frail bones\", and \"club lichen\", the last of which is also used to refer to the entire genus.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nIn the thallus of M. mucida, the algae are not merely scattered. Instead, they are organised into small, closely situated globules embedded in a gelatinous matrix on moist, rotting wood. This Botrydina-type thallus structure, common in basidiolichens, serves multiple functions. It protects the algae from UV light and desiccation, while ensuring close contact through a hyphal network that provides a continuous water and minerals supply. The fruiting bodies (basidiocarps) are typically simple to lobed and can reach up to 2 cm (0.8 in) in height. They are waxy-tough but can become slimy, transitioning from white or creamy colour to grey or pale tan as they mature. These structures often dry to show a pure white tip. The fruiting bodies' stickiness often causes debris to adhere to their surfaces. The algal partners are encapsulated in tiny pockets of fungal tissue, yet they retain a loose, unstructured form, manifesting as a green granular crust where the fungus produces its fruiting bodies. Despite their mutualistic relationship, both the algae and the fungus maintain their individual morphology. The relationship between coccomyxoid green algae and M. mucida was documented by Geitler in 1955, noting that the algae are larger within the lichen than when free-living. He suggested in 1956 that this size difference could be due to a decrease in algal division frequency induced by the fungal partner, the mycobiont. Using electron microscopy, Hiroshi Masumoto identified the photobiont partner of M. mucida as Elliptochloris subsphaerica.\nThe fungus's internal structure features thin to slightly thick-walled hyphae. These threads are generally parallel, interlocking, and often merged, showing many branching and connecting points (anastomoses). These hyphae also feature clamp connections, which are small bridge-like structures connecting the cells, and can be up to 200 µm long.\nBelow the surface layer, thinner, more twisted hyphae form the basidia as side branches. Basidia are typically short and narrow, with four to six outgrowths (sterigmata) from which spores are released. They measure 15–25 by 4–6 µm. The spores themselves are ovoid to ellipsoid, smooth, and can contain one or two oil droplets (guttulate), appearing white in spore prints and measuring 4.5–7.7 by 1.8–3.2 µm. M. mucida does not react with any of the standard chemical spot tests and is not known to contain any secondary metabolites (lichen products).\nDavid Arora, in his popular field guide Mushrooms Demystified, describes the edibility of these tiny and temporary fruit bodies as \"utterly inconsequential\".\n\n\n=== Similar species ===\n\nMulticlavula mucida shares similarities with the Japanese species Multiclavula petricola. They resemble each other in the colour and general structure of their fruiting bodies, which are typically white and primarily unbranched. However, the two species differ significantly in the size of their basidiospores: those of M. mucida measure 4.5–7.7 µm in length, which are shorter than the 7.3–9.5 µm-basidiospores of M. petricola. Additionally, while M. mucida typically grows on decaying wood, M. petricola prefers rocky substrates. Multiclavula vernalis, while somewhat similar in appearance to M. mucida, is distinguished by its orange colour, its preference for growing on soil, and the presence of cystidia. Multiclavula coronilla, which grows on similar substrates, bears resemblance but can be differentiated by its shorter and simpler (unbranched) fruiting bodies, which are up to 1 cm tall, and its by its basidia, which have 6 to 8 sterigmata. Differentiating these two species typically requires microscopic examination.\nAnother species resembling M. mucida is Clavicorona taxophila. This small, whitish species, characterised by a broadened, flattened tip, typically grows on twigs, needles, and other types of debris, rather than amidst scum on rotting wood. In the Neotropics, M. mucida closely resembles Sulzbacheromyces leucodontium in appearance. However, their ecological preferences differ; M. mucida mainly grows on decaying logs, while S. leucodontium typically inhabits terrestrial environments in lowland and sub-lowland forests. Additionally, Multiclavula species are more commonly found in mountainous regions.\n\n\n== Habitat and distribution ==\n\nThis species is commonly found on decomposing wood, often in the presence of algae. It thrives on a wide variety of substrates, including bamboo, beech, cedar, poplar, and oak. In Central Europe, coniferous wood is a particularly favoured substrate. M. mucida is widely distributed, found in Asia, Europe, North and South America, and possibly Australia, with its North American range extending as far north as Alaska.\nThe discovery of M. mucida at unusually low elevations, specifically around 130 to 135 m (427 to 443 ft) above sea level in the Bienwald area of Rhineland-Palatinate, has prompted a reevaluation of its distribution and naming inconsistencies across different scientific literatures. Unlike other members of its genus, which prefer sandy soils, this species predominantly relies on rotting wood in moist environments. Lothar Geitler first identified this species as an extratropical lichen in 1955, challenging the then-prevailing view that basidiolichens were exclusively tropical.\nPreviously considered native to Northern Europe and the mountains of Central Europe, M. mucida has been increasingly observed across most European countries and globally. This expansion in its geographical range could be attributed to the establishment and maintenance of natural forest reserves, environments that foster the decay of thick logs and provide suitable habitats for the fungus. In addition to its growing presence in traditional locales, the species has been documented in regions as far-reaching as Australia, including Tasmania, and New Zealand.\nHistorically, however, the species has faced declines due to intensive forestry and environmental pollution, such as soil acidification from sulfur dioxide emissions, which damage its natural habitats.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nMulticlavula mucida has been categorised differently in mycological and lichenological circles, leading to its varying status in conservation lists. In Germany, for example, it has been listed under different categories in the Red List of endangered plants and macrofungi, reflecting a disparity in its assessment between being recognised as a fungus and as a lichen. In Finland's Regional Red List, it is classified as endangered, with a population size of less than 2,500 individuals and a continual decline. In Lithuania, it is considered very rare, being limited to only 1–3 known localities, and in Estonia, it is categorised as vulnerable. In the latter country, it is considered an indicator of old-growth forest. These primeval forests, where the lichen is found, are increasingly rare in Europe and are mainly preserved in nature reserves. Because of its small size and seasonal appearance, M. mucida has been described as inconspicuous and easy to overlook.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Ararkis Sandstorm is a limited-production electric supercar designed and manufactured by Ararkis Automobili, a United Kingdom-based company.\n\n\n== Performance and construction ==\nArarkis claims that the car is able to acceleration from 0 to 100 kilometres per hour (62 mph) in 1.5 seconds. If achieved, this would potentially place the Sandstorm among the fastest accelerating electric hypercars in the world. Additionally, the 115 kWh battery is estimated to provide a maximum range of 500 kilometres (310 mi) on a single charge.\nThe Ararkis Sandstorm features an electric powertrain. It utilizes a pair of permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs). The front and rear have custom, individual, motors. The specific power outputs or control details of the motors have not been publicly disclosed.\nThe Sandstorm uses carbon fiber and recycled materials in the body construction, which aim to reduce the vehicle's overall environmental impact. As an electric vehicle, the Sandstorm produces zero tailpipe emissions during operation.\nThe Sandstorm has two seats made of magnesium-aluminum alloy, Alcantara, and CFRP. A central touchscreen and wireless features are included.\n\n\n== Production ==\nReportedly, only 20 Ararkis Sandstorms are planned to be produced, with a starting price of $2 million.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024 New Holland Canadian Junior Curling Championships were held from March 24 to 31 at the Suncor Community Leisure Centre and the Oilsands Curling Club in Fort McMurray, Alberta. The winners earned the right to represent Canada at the 2025 World Junior Curling Championships.\nThis was the second time Fort McMurray played host to the Canadian Junior Curling Championships. The city previously held the 2013 championship which was won by Manitoba's Matt Dunstone and British Columbia's Corryn Brown. Fort McMurray was also supposed to host the 2021 championship before it was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, being replaced by the 2021 World Junior Qualification Event.\nThe event featured eighteen teams on both the men's and women's sides, each split into two pools of nine.

        "content": "Montague Gosset (1 July 1792 – 21 October 1854) was an English surgeon.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGosset born on 1 July 1792, was the second son of Daniel Gosset of Langhedge Hall, Tanner's End, Edmonton. He was educated at a school at Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, conducted by a clergyman named Jones. Although he wished to adopt a learned profession, his father determined that he should join the navy. He was accordingly entered in November 1806 on board H.M.S. Curlew, commanded by Captain Thomas Young. He remained with Young until July 1807, when he was transferred to the Guerrier, and subsequently to the Snake sloop of war, in which he narrowly escaped shipwreck. After serving nearly three years he was invalided from the West Indies with a broken leg and shattered health. On his recovery he resolved to quit the navy and study surgery. He was apprenticed to Mr. Stocker of Guy's Hospital in 1809, and obtained his diploma in May 1814. He passed through the hospital with considerable distinction, being a favoured pupil of Sir Astley Cooper. By Cooper he was recommended to the Marquis of Bute, who was then suffering from an eye complaint. In 1815 he went to Scotland for two years, after which he returned to Guy's Hospital, and again devoted himself to study until 1819, when he commenced practice as a consulting surgeon in Great George Street, Westminster. Thence he removed to the city, where he practised for thirty-four years, first in George Street and lastly in Broad Street Buildings. Gosset was among the first to detect and describe in February 1827 a peculiar accident to the elbow-joint, namely dislocation of the ulna backwards and inwards. The case is mentioned in Sir Astley Cooper's ‘Treatise on Dislocations,’ ed. B. B. Cooper, 1842, pp. 451–2. In 1829 Gosset communicated the only case of renal aneurism then detected, the preparation of which was placed in the museum of Guy's Hospital. In 1834 he directed attention to the use of the gilt-wire suture, which he employed in a case of vesico-vaginal fistula of eleven years' standing. Sir Astley Cooper had previously treated the case unsuccessfully with the ordinary appliances. In 1835 he published a description of an improved tonsil iron, which facilitated the application of ligatures for the removal of enlarged tonsils. Having successfully applied nitric acid for the destruction of nævi for twenty years, he published in 1844 a paper showing the efficacy of that remedy. During the same year he detailed a simple yet effective mode of stopping hæmorrhage from leech-bites. He also reported an important case of the dislocation of the os malæ which occurred in 1824; of this a description likewise appeared in Sir Astley Cooper's ‘Treatise on Dislocations,’ pp. 347–8. He assisted too in introducing two instruments for dividing strictures of the urethra. The first was used at Guy's Hospital as early as 1818. Gosset was made an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1843; but, though warmly supported by many of the fellows and the whole medical press, he was never admitted to the membership of the council, on account of his not being attached to the staff of a public hospital. Upon his rejection he issued a manly protest to the profession. He died somewhat suddenly at Broad Street Buildings on 21 October 1854, never having recovered from an attack of erysipelas incurred during a post-mortem examination. He was buried in the family vault at All Saints' Church, Edmonton. He had married early, and of a numerous family eight children survived him.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Goodwin, Gordon (1890). \"Gosset, Montague\".

        "content": "Meaning Maker is a conceptual, social practice art project by Kent Manske and Nanette Wylde. The project consists of ten questionnaires on a range of topics. It was initiated in 2006 by PreNeo Press. Meaning Maker has been exhibited in galleries, published in journals, is included in the RISD artists' book collection, and has been unofficially distributed and placed at numerous art events.\n\n\n== Description ==\nMeaning Maker takes form as a series of fill-out-form pamphlets. Each pamphlet is an \"edition\" which focuses on a single subject. The Meaning Makers are: Academic Conference, American Citizenship, Art Viewing Experience, Control, Family Gathering, Food, Higher Education, Periodic Personal Evaluation, Relationship to Nature, and U.S. Presidential Elections. This project exists in the physical world and on the Internet. The pamphlets are distributed in public places, most often art galleries and museums, and at art or academic conferences. They are also distributed online as pdfs. The project appears to be open ended, with the most recent edition being published in 2015.It is expansive and precise, as claims curator Jan Rindfleisch, who writes about Meaning Maker, “For viewing art and the art world, try Meaning Maker, a guided interactive tool to foster understanding and evaluation of specific experiences.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nJason Urban describes the project, \"Physically, Meaning Maker is modest: a multi-colored series of letter-sized tri-folds. It would look at home in any Kinko’s or a Human Resources office but it is only a spoof of corporate aesthetics. A closer look would reveal Meaning Maker to be a subversive tool for conceptual intervention.”Discussing Meaning Maker, Carolyn Guertin writes, \"The point of such a conceptual art project is that since it is infinitely renewable, it functions as a social critique of the expected norms of particular kinds of experiences.” Aimee Le Duc claims, \"Participants were encouraged to download copies, reuse the questionnaires and become the type of person most palatable in each of the pamphlets. The language is innocuous and satirical, but unsettling in the striking ease in which we all employ these assimilating tactics in our daily lives.\"Stephanie Ellis reviews Meaning Maker for Stretcher, \"Meaning Maker offered free low-tech transparent envelopes stuffed with a set of questionnaires, a nifty blue pencil, and a small pin with a plump “!” shadowed by a “?.” (Packets were discreetly labeled “this is art.”) The questionnaires (sans agenda) cover a series of occasions that often trigger zombie behavior such as an academic conference or a family reunion. In the latter, under “how I fit in?” you may choose among: the clown, the boss, at odds, the peacekeeper and so on. There was also a chance to check off the TV show that best represented your family. Hooked? The sweetly sincere self-reflective tools can be downloaded from their Web site. You might be inspired to write your own.\"\n\n\n== Publications ==\nMeaning Maker has been included in the follow print publications, FLAT (published by Karol Shumaker, Chicago ) and Visual Communication Quarterly (CSU Fullerton),  and Join + Cast Guide to Contemporary Art (Phoenix, Arizona, 2011).\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nMeaning Maker has officially exhibited at the following art venues: The Euphrat Museum of Art in Cupertino, California; The Schneider Museum of Art in Ashland, Oregon; The Lab in San Francisco, California, among others.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website",

        "content": "Plug and Play Tech Center (\"Plug and Play\") is an American early stage venture capital firm headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. According to CB Insights from 2020 to 2022, it was the most active startup accelerator in the world with an average deal count of 929 per year.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSaeed Amidi came from a family of Iranian immigrants who came to the U.S. in 1979 to escape the Iranian Revolution and established the Amidi Group, a manufacturing business which also had real estate holdings. In 1988, it acquired 165 University Avenue, a small office building in Palo Alto, California used to rent out spaces for companies.During the Dot-com bubble, Amidi and his business partner, Pejman Nozad  invested in some of the tenants in 165 University Avenue during their early stages. These included Google, PayPal, Logitech and Danger which gave Amidi multimillion-dollar payouts.In 2006, Amidi used the returns from his investments to fund the Plug and Play Tech Center in Sunnyvale, California. It was based in a three-story 150,000-square-foot building that would rent space and provide other amenities such as gyms and cafeterias to startup companies. It would also provide them with ready access to data centers and telecommunications infrastructure. Amidi and Nozad would use their positions as landlords to look at their tenants before deciding which ones to invest in. Plug and Play would also host events for entrepreneurs to meet. In September 2007, it housed 108 companies.From 2020 to 2022, 41% of the firm's investments were in the U.S., 30% in Europe and 17% in Asia.Outside the U.S., Plug and Play has expanded to various regions where it has set up local offices. In 2017, it partnered with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group to open an office in Tokyo to invest in Japanese ventures. In June 2023, it was in talks with Jada under the Public Investment Fund to raise $100 million to invest in Saudi Arabia technology startups.\n\n\n== Notable investments ==\nNotable companies that Plug and Play invested in include PayPal, LendingClub and Dropbox.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

It typically contains various additives, including oxygenates like ethanol or methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), to improve octane rating and reduce air pollution.\n\n\n== Refining ==\nRBOB is refined from crude oil and about half of the crude oil is refined into RBOB gasoline, therefore RBOB tracks the price of WTI crude closely.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCommodity market\nGasoline\nFuel taxes in the United States\nNew York Mercantile Exchange\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mount Evans is a 2,250-metre (7,382-foot) glaciated summit in British Columbia, Canada.\n\n\n== Description ==\nMount Evans is located in the Coast Mountains immediately north of the head of Bute Inlet and 4.5 kilometres (2.8 mi) south-southwest of Teaquahan Mountain, which is the nearest higher neighbor. Precipitation runoff and glacial meltwater from this mountain drains to Bute Inlet via the Homathko River and Teaquahan River. Mount Evans is more notable for its rise above local terrain than for its absolute elevation as topographic relief is significant with the summit rising 2,230 metres (7,316 ft) above the Homathko River Valley in five kilometres (3.1 mi). The mountain's toponym and current location were officially adopted January 15, 1987, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada, although the name was published in 1867 as labelled on British Admiralty chart 580. The mountain's name origin/significance is not recorded.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nBased on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Evans is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Winter temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. This climate supports two unnamed glaciers on the slopes of the peak. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Mount Evans.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGeography of British Columbia\nGeology of British Columbia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWeather: Mount Evans",

        "content": "Between the 16th and 18th centuries, Alsace and Lorraine, territories of the Holy Roman Empire located between the Meuse and Rhine rivers, were annexed by the Kingdom of France. Part of these same territories (confusingly referred to as \"Alsace-Lorraine\" as a whole) were annexed by the German Empire in the 19th century, then by the Third Reich in the 20th century, before returning to French rule at the end of World War II.\n\n\n== Historical context ==\nThe fragmentation of the territories of the Holy Roman Empire, corresponding today to the historical regions of Lorraine and Alsace, made it relatively easy for the Kingdom of France to pursue a policy of annexation based on a \"natural\" frontier, the Rhine. The territories of the Three Bishoprics, Strasbourg the cities of the Décapole, and the Duchy of Lorraine were annexed to France. \nFrom 1871 to 1918, and then from 1940 to 1945, part of these territories, considered Germanic, were annexed by the newly created German Empire and by the Third Reich.\n\n\n== French annexations (16th–18th centuries) ==\n\n\n=== Austrasian March ===\nThe fragmentation of the territories of the Holy Roman Empire, corresponding today to the historical regions of Lorraine and Alsace, made it relatively easy for the Kingdom of France to pursue a policy of annexation based on a \"natural\" frontier, the Rhine. The territories of the Three Bishoprics, Strasbourg , and the cities of the Décapole, then those of the Duchy of Bar and the Duchy of Lorraine were annexed to France. \n\n\n=== Annexation of Alsace (1648–1697) ===\nOn October 24, 1648, the rivalry between the House of Austria and the Bourbons led to the Treaty of Westphalia, which ended the Thirty Years' War. France, the great victor of this long conflict, expanded its territory eastward: Metz, Toul, and Verdun were recognized as de jure French after a century of de facto protectorate. \nFrance annexed part of Alsace, in particular the Landgraviate of Upper Alsace (formerly the County of Sundgau) and the cities of the Alsatian Décapole.\nIn 1675, the Battle of Turckheim, lost by the Imperials, allowed France to annex new territories in Alsace.\nBy creating Chambres de Reunion in Metz, Besançon, and Brisach, Louis XIV was able to annex new territories without fighting: this was the Politique des Réunions. Thus, by a decree of March 22, 1680, the Council of Alsace annexed to the Kingdom of France the bailiwicks of Kutzenhausen, Bergzabern, Annweiler, Guttemberg, Gossersweiler, Vogelbourg, Otbourg, Cleebourg, Falkenbourg, the villages of Rechtenbach, half of the village of Dambach, and the castle and village of Riedseltz. \nBy decree of August 9, 1680, the Council of Alsace united the Counties of Hanau-Lichtenberg and Oberbrunn, the Barony of Fleckenstein, the bailiwicks of Gressenstein, Wafslen, Barr, Illkirch, Marlem, Bischwiller and Reichshoffen, and the bailiwicks of Sulz, Guebwiller, Rouffach, Marckolsheim and Marmoutier, the county of Dagsbourg (Linange-Dabo), the principality of La Petite-Pierre and Murbach, the county of Horbourg, the seigneury of Riquewihr, the Ban de la Roche, the lands and seigneuries of the bishopric of Strasbourg and Saint-Hippolyte. \nIn September 1697, with the signing of the Treaty of Ryswick, Louis XIV definitively annexed four-fifths of Alsace to France, including Strasbourg and the towns of the Décapole.\n\n\n=== Annexation of Lorraine (1552–1766) ===\nIn 1301, because of his opposition to the King of France, the Count of Bar was forced to pay tribute to the French sovereign for the part of his county on the left bank of the Meuse, henceforth known as the Barrois mouvants. The eastern part of the County of Bar and the Duchy of Lorraine remained part of the Holy Roman Empire. \nAs an integral part of the Holy Roman Empire, the free cities of Metz, Toul, and Verdun and the adjoining episcopal principalities were de facto annexed to France in April 1552 by King Henry II of France, who was allied with the German Protestants. \nHenri II also imposed a francophone regent on the young Duke of Lorraine and Bar, Charles III, who was subsequently elevated to the French court. In 1633, despite an earlier commitment to respect the particular customs of the Messins, Toulois, and Verdunois, the Kingdom of France established a parliament in Metz with jurisdiction over the Three Bishoprics. \nIn 1648, the Treaty of Westphalia annexed the bishoprics and imperial cities de jure.\nIn February 1661, with the Treaty of Vincennes, the King of France returned the Duchy of Bar to the Duke of Lorraine in exchange for several villages in Lorraine, to create a passage that would allow him to reach Alsace directly without passing through a foreign country. The capital and the duchy were occupied again from 1670 to 1697.\nThe annexationist policy of the Réunions continued in Lorraine. \nThe Chamber of Metz successively united:\n\nBy a decree of April 12, 1680, the castle and county of Veldenz.\nBy a first decree of April 15, 1680, the lands and castellanies of Condé-sur-Moselle and Conflans-en-Jarnisy.\nBy a second decree of April 15, 1680, the town, castle, and land of Commercy.\nBy a decree of April 30, 1680, the county of Vaudémont, the county of Chaligny, and the castellany of Turquestein-Blancrupt.\nBy a first decree of May 6, 1680, the town and castle of Épinal.\nBy a second decree of May 6, 1680, the town and castellany of Sarrebourg.\nBy a decree of May 10, 1680, the castle, town, and seigneury of Nomeny and the land and ban of Delme.\nBy a first decree of May 20, 1680, the castle and town of Hombourg and the town of Saint-Avold.\nBy a second decree of May 20, 1680, the town, castle, castellany, and seigneury of Albe (Sarralbe).\nBy a decree of May 23, 1680, the town, lands, and seigneury of Marsal.\nBy a first decree of May 29, 1680, the castle and seigneury of Sampigny.\nBy a second decree of May 29, 1680, the castle, town, castellany and provostry of Hattonchâtel.\nBy a decree of June 6, 1680, the lands and seigneuries of Salm and Pierre-Percée.\nBy decree of June 12, 1680, the town, castle, and barony of Apremont.\nBy decree of June 13, 1680, the land and seigneury of Mars-la-Tour.\nBy decree of June 14, 1680, the town of Blâmont and the lands and seigneuries of Mandres-aux-Quatre-Tours, Deneuvre, and Amermont.\nBy decree of June 21, 1680, the castle of Lutzelbourg.\nBy a decree of June 27, 1680, the land and seigneury of Briey.\nBy a first decree of June 28, 1680, the county of Deux-Ponts.\nBy a second decree of June 28, 1680, the castle, county, and seigneury of Castres.\nBy a decree of July 4, 1680, the town and seigneury of Dieuze.\nBy a decree of July 8, 1680, the castle, town and county of Sarrebruck.\nBy a first decree of July 11, 1680, the county of Sarrewerden and Bouquenom.\nBy a second decree of July 11, 1680, the town, land and seigneury of Ottwiller.\nBy a first decree of July 15, 1680, the land and seigneury of Bousseviller.\nBy a second decree of July 15, 1680, the lands and seigneuries of La Marck, Marmonstier and Ochsenstein.\nBy a third decree of July 15, 1680, the castle and seigneury of Trognon.\nBy a decree of August 16, 1680, the seigneury of Sierck and the town of Port (Saint-Nicolas).\nBy a decree of September 16, 1680, the castle, land and seigneury of Créhange.\nBy a first decree of October 24, 1680, the town, land and seigneury of Virton.\nBy a second decree of October 24, 1680, the castle, land, and manor of Bitche.\nBy a first decree of November 7, 1680, the castle, land, and manor of Oberstein.\nBy a second decree of November 7, 1680, the castle, land and seigneury of Rembercourt-aux-Pots.\nBy a decree of November 28, 1680, the castle and town of Mussey.\nBy decree of December 5, 1680, the castle, land and manor of Réchicourt.\nBy decree of December 9, 1680, the town of Étain.\nBy decree of December 12, 1680, the county of Morhange.\nBy decree of December 23, 1680, the land and seigneury of Domèvre.\nBy decree of December 26, 1680, the town and seigneury of Gondreville.\nBy decree of March 6, 1681, the town and seigneury of Neufcastle.\nBy decree of March 10, 1681, the towns and seigneuries of Arrancy and Pierrevillers.\nBy decree of April 21, 1681, the county of Chiny.\nBy decree of May 16, 1683, the county of Vaudémont.\nBy decree of June 2, 1683, the lordships, provostships and castellanies of Pont-à-Mousson, Saint-Mihiel, and others.The Treaty of Ryswick gave the Barrois and Lorraine their independence and their rightful sovereign, Leopold I. The young Duke, the Emperor's nephew, married a niece of Louis XIV, Elisabeth Charlotte d'Orléans, who paradoxically became the driving force behind resistance to French annexation.\nIn 1702, the War of the Spanish Succession was the pretext for a fourth French occupation of the duchies of Bar and Lorraine. In 1733, the War of the Polish Succession had the same effect.\nTo facilitate his marriage and election as head of the Holy Roman Empire, Duke François III of Lorraine agreed, despite his mother's objections, to exchange his patrimonial duchies for Tuscany. The Duchy of Bar and the Duchy of Lorraine were given for life to Stanislas Leszczynski, father-in-law of Louis XV, the dethroned King of Poland. It was agreed that upon the death of the sovereign, Barrois and Lorraine would become French. Stanislas left the administration of the duchy to his son-in-law and he died in 1766.\n\n\n=== Annexations of principalities and enclaves (1766–1814) ===\nFrom 1769 to 1786, a series of treaties between France and the princes of the Empire gradually regularized the border. In many places, watercourses marked the boundary; many enclaves on either side disappeared, but the border still did not consist of a single boundary.\nDuring the French Revolution, the following territories became part of France (year of annexation in parentheses):\n\nCounty of Kriechingen (1793).\nCounty of Dagsburg (1793).\nCounty of Saarwerden (1793).\nObersteinbach, part of the Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt (1793).\nCounty of Montbéliard (1793).\nPrincipality of Salm-Salm (1793).\nLordship of Lixing (1795).\nAustrian enclave of Manderen (1795).\nHoly Roman Enclave of Zetting-Dieding (1795 or 1797).\nHoly Roman Enclave of Hundling (1797).\nEnclave du Saint-Empire de Rouhling (1797 or 1798).\nRepublic of Mulhouseallied with the Swiss cantons (1798).\n\n\n== German annexations (19th–20th centuries) ==\n\n\n=== Treaties of Paris (1814 and 1815) ===\n\nIn Lorraine, under the Treaty of Paris (1814), Moselle lost several communes and hamlets to Prussia, including the Canton of Tholey and seven communes in the Canton of Sierck-les-Bains.In 1815, part of the Moselle cantons of Relling and Sarrelouis and all of the cantons of Saarbrücken and Saint-Jean became Prussian. Certain communes and hamlets in these cantons later returned to French territory under the demarcation treaty of October 23, 1829.In Alsace, the Bas-Rhin lost all its territories north of the Lauter in 1815. Some of these territories had been gained first by the Treaty of Paris in 1814. This included the 4 cantons of Bergzabern, Candel, Dahn, and Landau.\n\n\n=== German annexation of Alsace-Moselle (1871–1919) ===\n\nIn 1871, following the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, part of these territories, corresponding to the modern departments of Bas-Rhin, Haut-Rhin , and Moselle, became part of the German Empire. These territories, considered strategic by the Germans as they extended the border beyond the Rhine and included the strongholds of Metz and Strasbourg, were ceded in two stages.\n\nIn a letter justifying the decision to annex these territories to a unified Germany, Emperor William explained to Empress Eugenie that the real motivation was strictly military, using the annexed territories as a military glacis to keep the French border away from the Rhine and Meuse rivers. Thus, the Welches valleys of Alsace and the Metz region, not following the linguistic border, found themselves \"imperial territory\" under the official name of \"Alsace-Lorraine\" and the direct administration of Emperor William.\nThe preliminary peace treaty of February 26, 1871, put an end to the fighting between France and Germany. The Treaty of Frankfurt (May 10, 1871) established the terms of peace. In addition to a substantial indemnity, France had to cede part of its territory to the Reich. In Alsace, the departments of Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin became German, except for the arrondissement of Belfort. In Lorraine, the former department of Moselle, except for Briey,the arrondissements of Château-Salins and Sarrebourg, which belonged to the former department of Meurthe, and the cantons of Saales and Schirmeck became German.\nUntil the adoption of the Constitution of 1911, Alsace-Moselle was governed directly by the Emperor and there were many tensions, the most famous of which was the Zabern Affair, which revealed the tensions between the inhabitants and the central power. From November 1918 until the signing of the Treaty of Versailles on June 28, 1919, the region was occupied by France in the application of the provisions of the Armistice of November 11, 1918, before becoming an integral part of the French nation again under article 27 of the Peace Treaty.\n\n\n=== De facto annexation of Alsace-Moselle (1940–1945) ===\nAfter the defeat of the French armies and the withdrawal of the British troops, the signing of the Armistice on June 22, 1940 provided for the occupation of northern France by the armies of the Third Reich. \nThe Nazi regime seized the opportunity to occupy Alsace and Moselle, despite the inviolability of the French borders, as stipulated in the armistice. Germany therefore expelled French citizens who were too demonstrative in their refusal, and foreigners whom they considered to be German citizens. They proceeded to conscript young Alsatians-Mosellans under the Nazi flag, leading to the tragedy of the Malgré-nous. The victory of the Allies and the liberation of France at the end of 1944 and the beginning of 1945 put an end to this last annexation.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nParisot, Robert (1922).

        "content": "James Hamilton (1749 – 27 October 1835) was a Scottish physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHamilton was the son of Robert Hamilton, professor of divinity at Edinburgh. He was born at Edinburgh in 1749, and studied medicine there and on the continent. He early became physician to the Royal Infirmary, to George Heriot's Hospital, and other hospitals in Edinburgh, and had a large practice. He died at Edinburgh on 27 October 1835. For many years he was a picturesque figure in the city, retaining very old-fashioned manners and dress; he is said to have been the last person who wore the three-cornered cocked hat. He was most noted for his work entitled 'Observations on the Utility and Administration of Purgative Medicines,' 1805; 8th edit. 1826. Numerous American editions were also published, and it was translated into Italian, German, and French. Hamilton was thoroughly old-fashioned in his treatment, believing in free blood-letting and profuse purging, and in strong mercurial treatment for syphilis. He was very jocular, kind-hearted, and athletic. There are amusing accounts of him in the 'Lives' of Sir Astley Cooper and Sir Robert Christison, and in John Kay's 'Edinburgh Portraits.' The works of three James Hamiltons were previously  catalogued as by one man in the 'British Museum Catalogue:' (1) the above-mentioned, always known as James Hamilton, senior; (2) James Hamilton, junior, who lived next door to him in St. Andrew's Square, Edinburgh; and (3) James Hamilton, M.D. (1740–1827), successively of Dunbar, Edinburgh, Leeds, and London, a friend of John Wesley, who is depicted with him in a well-known print by Kay.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Bettany, George Thomas (1890). \"Hamilton, James (1749-1835)\".

        "content": "Portrait of Charles de Solier, Sieur de Morette is an oil on oak painting completed in around 1534–1535 by German painter and printmaker, Hans Holbein the Younger, now at the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister, Dresden. It depicts the French diplomat, Charles de Solier (1480–1552), Francis I's ambassador to England.\nCharles de Solier replaced Jean de Dinteville as resident ambassador, arriving in London on 3 April 1534 where he remained until 26 July 1535, during which time his portrait was commissioned.\n\n\n== Description ==\nDescribed as \"[o]ne of the greatest of all Holbein's individual portraits\" by art historian Susan Foister, this painting is extraordinary for the simplicity of its composition. The subject stands before a curtain of sea-green damask, represented life-size and half-length, facing the viewer. He wears a doublet of black satin, the sleeves of which are slashed with white silk; the gold buttons are adorned with an ornamental motif of two M's. His surcoat is of the same black material, with a heavy collar and lining of fur. Both sleeves and black cap are decorated with gold tags, and on the cap he wears a circular gold cap-badge with a figure of John the Baptist with an inscription: DOCE ME FACERE VOLVNTATEM. A design by Holbein for a cap-badge with John the Baptist survives in the British Museum. Around his neck is a gold chain from which hangs a medallion or watchcase of openwork. The attitude, the glove on the left hand and the half-covered medallion on the chain are reminiscent of Titian’s L'Homme au Gant in the Louvre. In his right hand he holds a glove, and his left, which is gloved, grasps the gilt and elaborately chased sheath of a dagger, suspended from his girdle by a chain with a large tassel, such as the one worn by Jean de Dinteville in The Ambassadors (1533). His long, reddish beard is streaked with grey.\nFranny Moyle observes that the imposing figure of Charles de Solier is \"unquestionably regal\" and there seems little doubt this portrait is a \"prototype for his next cycle of work – his portraits of Henry VIII.\" \n\n\n== Indentification ==\nThe preliminary drawing of the head is in the Kupferstich-Kabinett, Dresden; an engraving by Wenceslas Hollar appears to have been made from the drawing and gives in addition to the date, 1647, the name “Mr. Morett”, ex collectiane Arundeliana. The painting came into the possession of Duke Francesco I of Modena, after the Earl of Arundel tried in vain to buy it. In 1657 the Microcosmo della Pittura by Francesco Scanelli still mentioned Holbein's picture though the name of the man portrayed was no longer known. Subsequently, the name of the artist was also forgotten and the painting entered the gallery of August III, King of Poland and Elector of Saxony as \"portrait of Ludovico il Moro, Duke of Milan, by Leonardo da Vinci\".\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nIn the 19th century Carl Friedrich von Rumohr recognised it as a work by Holbein and Johann Gottlob von Quandt identified the man as the goldsmith Hubert Morett, who had worked at the same time as Holbein at the court of Henry VIII. In 1881, after the Holbein exhibition at Dresden, Norwegian art collector, Sophus Larpent's study, Sur le portrait de Morett dans la galerie de Dresde, proved that the life-size painting represented the French diplomat. Conclusive proof was provided by the discovery, in 1903, of a boxwood model of a contemporary medallion by Christoph Weiditz, now at the Victoria and Albert Museum, which represents Morette full face, aged about 50, with his name and titles in full; on the back his device of a seaport, a horse, and a dolphin.\n\n\n== Provenance ==\nMarchese Massimiliano Montecuccoli, Estense ambassador at Parma and Rome, gave it to Duke Francesco I of Modena (1629–1658); thence by descent, Duke Francesco III of Modena (1737–1780), who sold it, together with other important paintings, in 1746, to August III, King of Poland and Elector of Saxony, as \"Portrait of Ludovico Sforza by Leonardo da Vinci\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of paintings by Hans Holbein the Younger\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nPortrait of Charles de Solier, Sieur de Morette at the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister, Dresden\nCharles de Solier, Lord of Morette, Medal Victoria and Albert Museum, London",

Satellite-to-ground laser ranging as well as intersatellite microwave ranging techniques will also be tested.\nThe Tiandu satellites' mission is to inform the design of China's proposed Queqiao lunar navigation and communication array. Supporting services for lunar surface operations would be provided by such system. Line-of-sight communications limits affect uncrewed and crewed operations on the Moon, especially at the lunar south pole, an area of great interest, or the lunar far side.\nThe 61 kg (134 lb) Tiandu-1 carries a Ka dual-band integrated communication payload, a laser retroreflector, a space router and other payloads. The 15 kg (33 lb) Tiandu-2 carries a communication payload and navigation devices.\n\n\n== Mission ==\nThe mission was launched together as a single probe with Queqiao 2 in 2024 on a Long March 8 rocket.\nAfter launch, the two satellites (while being  attached to each other) underwent lunar orbit insertion on 24 March 2024 at 17:43 UTC and entered a large elliptical orbit around the Moon. In that large elliptical orbit around the Moon, they separated on 3 April 2024 and later satellite-to-ground laser ranging are inter-satellite microwave ranging are to be carried out by these satellites via high-precision lunar orbit determination technology.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Alexander Henry Haliday (1728? – 28 April 1802) was an Irish physician and politician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHaliday was the son of Samuel Haliday, the nonsubscribing divine, was born at Belfast about 1728. He was educated at Glasgow as a physician, and practised with great repute at Belfast, where for nearly half a century he was one of the most influential of public men. On 23 December 1770 Belfast was invaded by some twelve hundred insurgents belonging to the society known as ‘Hearts of Steel,’ who marched from Templepatrick, co. Antrim, to rescue one David Douglas, imprisoned on a charge of maiming cattle. The ‘Hearts of Steel’ were animated by agrarian discontent, and their immediate grievance was that Belfast capitalists had purchased leases from the Marquis of Donegall over the tenants' heads. Haliday's prompt interposition between the rioters and the authorities saved the town from destruction by fire. His house in Castle Street was the headquarters of James Caulfeild, earl of Charlemont, on his annual visits to Belfast from 1782 in connection with the volunteer conventions. His correspondence with Charlemont (of which some specimens are given in Benn) lasted till the earl's death, and is full of information on the politics of the north of Ireland, enlivened by strokes of humour. He died at Belfast on 28 April 1802. ‘Three nights before he died,’ writes Mrs. Mattear to William Drennan, ‘Bruce and I played cards with him, and the very night that was his last he played out the rubber. “Now,” said he, “the game is finished, and the last act near a close.”’ He was buried in the Clifton Street cemetery, then newly laid out. His will leaves to his wife (an Edmonstone of Red Hall) ‘a legacy of 100l. by way of atonement for the many unmerciful scolds I have thrown away upon her at the whist table,’ also ‘the sum of 500l. in gratitude for her never having given on any other occasion from her early youth till this hour any just cause to rebuke or complain of her,’ and ‘a further sum of 100l.’ for her goodness in amusing him with ‘a game of picket’ when his eyesight had decayed. His fine library, rich in classics, was sold after his death; part of it was later the property of the First Presbyterian Church, Belfast. Haliday wrote, but did not publish, a tragedy, submitted to Charlemont, and many satirical verses. His grandson and namesake published anonymously a volume of original hymns, Belfast, 1844, 16mo.\nHis great-nephew was the entomologist Alexander Henry Haliday.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Henderson, Thomas Finlayson (1886). \"Blackadder, William\".

The Razorbacks are led by ninth-year head coach Courtney Deifel and play their home games at Bogle Park in Fayetteville, Arkansas.\n\n\n== Previous season ==\nAfter a 38–16 regular-season campaign in 2023, the Razorbacks fell in their first game of the SEC tournament, which was hosted at Bogle Park, to Alabama by a one-run margin. Arkansas was selected to host an NCAA regional for the third consecutive season as the No. 11 national seed. They were paired with Oregon, Notre Dame, and Harvard; After a defeat of Harvard, the Razorbacks fell to Oregon, putting them in the consolation bracket. A win to eliminate Notre Dame put them in the regional final, needing two wins against Oregon to advance to the super regional,  but a nine-run defeat to the Ducks ended Arkansas' season. The team finished with a record of 40–19.\n\n\n== Schedule and results ==\n\n\n== Record vs. conference opponents ==\nDate m/dd is for last scheduled game of series. Blank are not scheduled. Blue are home games, otherwise away.\n\nUpdated for all games through Apr 15,2024. \n\n\n== Rankings ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n2024 Arkansas Razorbacks baseball team\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Military Historical Journal (Russian: Вое́нно-истори́ческий журна́л, romanized: Voyenno-Istoricheskii Zhurnal) is a monthly Russian magazine focussed on military history. Initially published by the People's Commissariat of Defense of the Soviet Union (later: Soviet Ministry of Defense) between 1939 and 1941, publication was resumed in 1959 and has carried on since. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, publication was taken over by the Russian Ministry of Defense.\nIn English-language publications, the abbreviation used for the Military Historical Journal is VIZh.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Military Historical Journal was initially issued on 29 August 1939 as an organ of the People's Commissariat of Defense of the Soviet Union, with Boris Shaposhnikov as the first editor-in-chief.\nThe Military Historical Journal was re-founded in 1959 and used intensively by the Soviet Armed Forces for a theoretical reevaluation of military theory and tactics; a large number of articles covered the performance of the Soviet Union during World War II, and the Red Army in particular. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Military Historical Journal passed to the Ministry of Defense of the newly independent Russian Federation, which also made the previously more secluded journal face a much broader public audience. By its own definition, the journals aims to cover \"military policy of the Russian state\", \"historical experience of national security\", and \"activities of outstanding Russian and Soviet army and naval leaders\".\nThe archive broadly follows a pro-Russian and pro-Soviet agenda; for example, the suffering of the Polish victims of the 1940 Katyn massacre, perpetrated by the Soviet NKVD, was explicitly equivocated with the suffering of Soviet prisoners of the 1920 Polish–Soviet War. The analysis and documentation in this and other pieces of coverage has been criticized by historian David R. Stone as insufficiently balanced.\nIn 2012, the journal had a circulation of 4,200 copies. The editorial board is staffed by Russian intellectuals as well as by officers of the Russian Armed Forces.\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Военно-исторический журнал: Издание Министерства обороны России\" [Military Historical Journal: Publication of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation].\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Codices of San Andrés Tetepilco are Aztec codices made during the 1500s by Tlacuilos or Aztec scribes. It details the Founding of Tetepilco (now the borough of Iztapalapa), the inventory of an unnamed Church at Tetepilco and the transition and Conquest of the Aztec led by Hernán Cortés. Codices were acquired from a family who resided in Culhuacan and Iztapalapa.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nFirst documented in 2009, by University of Seville historian María Castañeda de Paz in Coyoacán, the corpus belonged to an anonymous family, who are deemed traditional stewards for the cultural history of Culhuacán and Iztapalapa. After years of coordination and negotiations on behalf of the Mexican government, through INAH, the family was paid 9.5 million pesos ($500,000 USD equivalent).\n\n\n== Contents ==\nThere are three codices, much of which are heavily damaged and all are incomplete:\nThe Map of the Founding of Tetepilco is a map of Tetepilco, that provides the information on the founding of Pueblo San Andrés Tetepilco, with markers for Colhuacan, Tetepilco, Tepanohuayan, Cohuatlinchan, Xaltocan, and Azcapotzalco.\nThe Inventory of the Church of San Andrés Tetepilco is a heavily damaged map of the church of San Andrés Tetepilco consisting of two extant pages.\nThe Tira of San Andrés Tetepilco is a pictographic history to the style of and familial strain of the Codex Boturini, the Aubin Codex, and MS.40 and MS.85 of Paris. Tira of San Andrés Tetepilco consists of 20 folded sheets depicting the history of Tenochtitlan, with a founding date of 1300, with the conquest of Tetepilco by Itzcoatl and Moctezuma I between 1427-1440. The history extends itself past the Spanish conquest, with Cortés depicted as a Roman soldier, extending to the year 1611.\nThey are a bilingual text, written in both Spanish and Romanized Nahuatl, and the texts itself are written on amate, with its dyes and inks composing of various plants, charcoal, and indigo, which make up its red, yellow ocre, black and blue.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe acquisition and documentation of the codices has been praised by INAH as the most significant authentication event of Mesoamerican text since the Maya Codex of Mexico. The three documents presents an addition to over a total of 200 Mesoamerican codices now in the collection of the Biblioteca Nacional de Antropología e Historia.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Alfred Hurst (November 19, 1846 – March 25, 1915) was an English-born American politician and businessman. A Democrat, he served in the Iowa Senate from 1892 to 1900, representing the 23rd district. He was also the founder of a large and successful lime business.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHurst was born on November 19, 1846, in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England. In 1852, he and his family immigrated to the United States, first landing at New Orleans, then settling in Davenport, Iowa. His father died in 1856, when he was nine years old. As a teenager, he enlisted in the Union Army during the Civil War, and fought at the battles of Paducah, Shiloh and Fort Donelson. He was captured by Confederate forces at Fort Donelson and escaped during the Second Battle of Memphis.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHurst moved to St. Louis following the war, where he engaged in steamboating. He discontinued this in 1866 and returned to Davenport with the intention of becoming a stonemason. He worked in Davenport until 1870, when he came to the Maquoketa area to inspect the limestone formations along the Maquoketa River. In 1871, he founded his lime company, A. Hurst & Company Lime Works, and built four kilns, which at their peak could produce 8,000 barrels of lime a day. He soon began selling to most states in the nation, becoming a major component of the lime industry in Iowa. He also founded the company-run town of Hurstville, now a ghost town north of Maquoketa, which consisted of two mansions, living quarters for workers, a school, a general store, a post office and various shops, among other things. The company employed around fifty people.\nIn 1886, he was elected to the board of supervisors of Jackson County, on which he served five years. In 1888, he organized the Maquoketa, Hurstville and Dubuque Railway Company and built a railroad connecting Maquoketa to Hurstville for the shipping of goods. In 1891, he was elected to the Iowa Senate from district 23, which constituted Jackson County. He assumed office on January 11, 1892, and was reelected in 1895, leaving office on January 7, 1900, after serving two terms. He was a member of the Appropriations, Highways, Military, Pharmacy, Printing, Public Buildings, Railways, Retrenchment, Senatorial and Representative Districts and Ways and Means committees. He also founded Maquoketa's fire department.\nA. Hurst & Co. began declining in the early 20th century as the popularity of portland cement increased, and effectively shut down by 1920. It was officially shut down in 1930 when William Hurst, Alfred's brother, died.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHurst married Sarah Lary, a Virginia native, on December 12, 1873, and had six children. He also had a brother, William K. Hurst, who assisted him in his business ventures. Hurst became ill on a trip to Chicago in 1915 and died on March 25 of that year at the age of 74. He was a Freemason, as well as a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and the Knights of Pythias.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Compound formation in Arabic represents a linguistic occurrence whereby two or more lexemes merge to create a singular word conveying a particular significance. This process of compounding is a fundamental aspect of Arabic morphology and plays a crucial role in lexical expansion and semantic enrichment. \nArabic compounds denote significant groupings of words that can construct either a full sentence or an incomplete expression referred to as a phrase. The construction of compounds in Arabic follows certain structural and semantic principles, reflecting the unique features of the language. Arabic compound formation exemplifies the intricate interplay between morphology, semantics, and syntax within the Arabic language, making it a rich area of study in linguistics.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nIn Arabic grammar, the foundation lies in the classification of linguistic units. A single word is known as mufrad مُفْرَد, encompasses a spectrum of parts of speech, including nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and others. When two or more words combine to form a compound, it's termed murakkab مُرَكَّب. Phrases are called d͡ʒumla ɣajru mufiːda جُمْلَة غَيْرُمُفِيْدَة or simply murakkab مُرَكَّب, while sentences are d͡ʒumla mufiːda جُمْلَة مُفِيْدَة or d͡ʒumla جُمْلَة. Further delving into the nuances, compounds in Arabic bear classifications denoting their completeness. The term almurakkabu nnaːqis اَلْمُرَكَّبُ النَّاقِص designates an incomplete compound, while almurakkabu attaːm اَلْمُرَكَّبُ التَّام signifies a complete one. This distinction underscores the importance of understanding the structural integrity of compounds within Arabic grammar.\nIn dissecting the anatomy of compounds, Arabic compounds typically consist of a head (the primary component conveying the main semantic content) and one or more modifiers (additional components modifying or specifying the meaning of the head). The order of elements in a compound can vary, but generally, the head precedes the modifier(s). In Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), compounds can be classified into four types. Concerning the primary element (head) within compounds, it's proposed that N + N compounds, apart from Specific General Constructions (SGC), Adj + Adj compounds, and reduplicated compounds, can exhibit either semantic dual-head structure or lack a clear head altogether. This complexity further enriches the understanding of Arabic compound formations, underlining the intricate tapestry of the Arabic language.\n\n\n=== Syntactic classification ===\nThese compounds can be formed through various morphological processes, including:\n\nNoun-Noun Compounds: This type of compound involves two nouns, where one noun serves as the head and the other as the modifier. For example, \"معلمو+الفيزياء\" (muʕallim-uu + l-fiizyaaʔ) meaning \"the physics teachers.\"\nVerb-Noun Compounds: These compounds combine a verb with a noun, where the verb typically functions as the modifier specifying the action or quality associated with the noun. For instance, \"شجرة+مثمرة\" (ʃaj.ra + muθ.mɪ.ra) meaning \"fruit-bearing tree.\"\nAdjective-Noun Compounds: Adjective-noun compounds involve the combination of an adjective and a noun, where the adjective modifies the noun, specifying its quality or characteristic. An example is \"سماء+زرقاء\" (sa.maʔ + zar.qaːʔ) meaning \"blue sky.\"\nVerb-Verb Compounds: In addition to noun-based compounds, Arabic, particularly Jordanian Arabic (JA), includes compounds created by joining two verbs. The verbs can either denote simultaneous actions, sequential actions, or actions that complement each other to convey a particular concept. An example of this type of compound in JA is \"قام+وقف\" (ga:m + waggaf),: 54  meaning \"rose and stood up.\"\n\n\n== Semantic Functions ==\nArabic compounds serve various semantic functions, including:\n\nSpecification: Compounds provide a more specific description of entities or concepts by combining lexical elements that complement each other semantically.\nModification: Compounds modify the meaning of the head noun by adding information about its attributes, features, or functions.\nDenotation: Compounds can denote complex concepts or objects that require multiple lexical components to convey their meaning effectively.\n\n\n== Linguistic Significance ==\nThe study of Arabic compounds holds significant importance in linguistics for several reasons:\n\nLexical Enrichment: Compounding contributes to the enrichment of the Arabic lexicon by generating new words through the combination of existing morphemes.\nSemantic Analysis: Analyzing compounds provides insights into the semantic relationships between lexical elements and the cognitive processes involved in word formation.\nCross-Linguistic Comparison: Studying Arabic compounds allows for comparisons with compound formation in other languages, shedding light on universal principles of morphology and word formation.\nThe study of Arabic compounds offers valuable insights into the structure and function of the language. While Arabic compounds share all conceptual relations with English compounds, they differ in head direction. Additionally, unique conceptual relations in Arabic compounds were identified, suggesting that Relational Morphology can reconcile various types of compounds, including lexicalized and novel ones. This sheds light on the complexity and versatility of Arabic morphology, enriching our understanding of linguistic systems and paving the way for further research in this field.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==",

        "content": "The Dnipro State Circus (Ukrainian: Дніпровський державний цирк, romanized: Dniprovsʹkyy derzhavnyy tsyrk) is a 20th century circus in the city of Dnipro, Ukraine. The venue hosted activities for the New Year, animal-filled circus acts, clown performances, and other forms of entertainment. It is the only circus in the country with a rehearsal and staged arena.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe building's original dome arch pattern, which produces acoustic and readily attaches equipment for artists to suspend, is what sets it apart. The circus was built using a tent covering made up of 12 prefabricated petals of reinforced concrete pieces, a first for domestic building. The most up to date lighting and audio equipment is installed in the hall. The only circus in Ukraine having a rehearsal and production venue is Dnipro State Circus. The auditorium can accommodate 1914 people.\nThe 92 kilometres (57 mi) metal rail improved the auditorium's acoustics and allowed performers to easily attach their equipment. There is a single installed original cross-grate with many winches positioned at different angles. The circus dome's highest point is 19 metres (62 ft) above the ground. Electrical workers installed 97 kilometres of wires in various areas all around the structure.\nRight on the Dnieper's river bank, adjacent to of the circus structure, the White Swan light and music fountain draws attention. The fountain appears to be flapping wings as it revolves, owing to the advancements in laser technology. The core jet reaches a height of 50 metres (160 ft). \n\n\n== History ==\nMobile circuses with deterrent tents, or open air, were a popular form of entertainment for locals in Katerynoslav throughout the 1800s. However, a permanent circus structure was constructed in Kachelnaya Square in 1885. It persisted until 1929. However, the circus and the ancient mansion were eventually relocated to Ozerna Square. The circus once more attracted the public to performances in February 1911. Back then, Gigetto Truzzi, Vladimir Durov, and the court Japanese circus Mikado made a successful tour in this area.\nThis circus operated out of a home that Gigetto Truzzi constructed and remained until 1929. A circus-chapito that was destroyed during Great Patriotic War had been operational since 1932. The circus was evacuated during the Second World War and the Nazi occupation from 1941 to 1943. The Theater of Illusions was the moniker given to the last few artists. All were deported to Germany in 1943, and it is unknown what became to them after that.\nThe Ozerna Square circus premises were reconstructed following the war. However, it presented its final show on 13 September 1959, and a new circus structure was constructed in June 1960 in accordance with the design of V.A. Zhukova, an architect from Kyiv. However, the lack of heating in the space meant that performances could only take place there during the warm season, which made the plan less successful.\nIn 1980, it relocated to a house designed in accordance with Pavlo Nirinberg's proposal, on the embankment in the city center. The circus building's grand opening was held on 24 December 1980. In the inaugural Carnival Goes Around The World Event at the new circus, artists welcomed the circus's construction workers.\nShabatko V.

        "content": "James Arthur Hanbury  (13 January 1832 – 2 June 1908) was an Irish surgeon-general.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHanbury born at Somerstoun House, parish of Laracor, near Trim, co. Meath, on 13 Jan. 1832, was one of the fourteen children of Samuel Hanbury, a large landowner, by his wife Louisa, daughter of Charles Ingham, rector of Kilmessan and Kilcool, Co. Meath. A brother, William, also in the army medical service, was with the 24th regiment when it was annihilated at the Battle of Chillianwala in 1849, assisted Florence Nightingale in establishing the hospital at Scutari, and was in charge of Netley Hospital until his death. Another brother. Fleet-surgeon Ingham Hanbury, R.N., after distinguishing himself at Tel-el-Kebir (mentioned in despatches and the bronze decoration and C.B.), died on his way to India in 1884.\nHanbury graduated M.B. from Trinity College, Dublin, in 1853. He entered the army medical service as an assistant surgeon on 30 September 1853; was promoted surgeon on 20 February 1863; surgeon-major on 1 March 1873; brigade surgeon on 27 November 1879; deputy surgeon-general on 5 May 1881; surgeon major-general on 14 June 1887, and retired from the service on 13 January 1892. He was elected an honorary F.R.C.S. Ireland on 19 July 1883 and F.R.C.S. England, on 14 April 1887 (his diploma of membership being dated 23 February 1859).\nHanbury was quartered for some years at Halifax, Nova Scotia, before he was sent to China and thence to India. He served with the Bazar valley expedition in the Afghan war of 1878–9, and was present during the march from Kabul to the relief of Kandahar. He was under fire in the battle of 1 September in that campaign, was mentioned in despatches, received the medal and clasp, the bronze decoration, and the C.B. (1881). He was principal medical officer under Lord Wolseley during the Egyptian campaign of 1882, when he was present at the battle of Tel-el-Kebir, and for the first time caused wounds to be dressed on the battlefield. Twice mentioned in despatches, he was made K.C.B. He served as principal medical officer at the Horse Guards and at Gibraltar (1887–8), and was surgeon-general of the forces in Madras (1888–92). In 1905 he received the reward for distinguished service. Tall (6 feet 1 inch in height), alert, and handsome, of great independence and energy, Hanbury was a popular master of hounds at Ootacamund. He died at Bournemouth on 2 June 1908. He married in 1876 Hannah Emily, daughter of James Anderson of Coxlodge Hall, Northumberland, and widow of Colonel Carter, C.B.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Henderson, Thomas Finlayson (1886). \"Blackadder, William\".

After a conflict within Shkoder, Gjergj retreated to a Kulla in Luma. There he made friends with the leader of the Kolosije tribe and married his daughter. As a result, he converted to Islam and took the name Dervish.  He settled in the Bicaj neighborhood of Luma, and raised a family of three boys. His grandson through his eldest son Hasan, would become Lumali Recep Pasha and settle in Kalkandelen (modern-day Tetovo). Lumali once served as a vali in Thessaloniki and was killed on the front of Iran.  \n\n\n== Pashalik of Kalkandelen ==\n\nWhile in Kalkandelen, and after the beginning of the decline of the Bushatli's Pashalik of Scutari, Recep would make regional reforms and expand his influence. He showed very good leadership skills by expanding his territory. Koca Recep, from the beginning of his administration, was committed to the territorial expansion of his domain. In order to include Gostivar, Koca Recep, sent his army under the command of Islam Aga Pipunca and defeated Delibaş Topal Bey, taking full control of the Polog region. He expanded further and administered the region of Kalkandelen, Üsküb and Kyustendil. He would be given the title of mirmiran and establish the Pashalik of Kalkandelen.\nRecep Pasha made an extraordinary contribution to the construction of many religious and protective buildings in Kalkandelen. The most important monuments in Tetovo are the works or initiatives of Recep Pasha. He is known as the main initiator for the construction of the Bektashi complex Arabati Baba Teḱe, as well as the construction of the Baltepe Fortress. \nThe Church of Saint Athanasius in Lešok was also rebuilt. Currently, the portrait of Recep Pasha and his son Abdurrahman Pasha can be found in the Monastery.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nRecep Pasha allocated a part of his wealth for humanitarian purposes. During his reign of Pashalik, inns, bridges, bakeries, workshops for the production of tobacco, taps and fountains of the city were built. His sons would rule over different Kazas of region; Abdurrahman Pasha of Kalkandelen, Havzi Pasha of Üsküb and Hasan Pasha of Kyustendil.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Erin J. Murphy is an American politician and educator who has served as an at-large member of the Boston City Council since December 2021. Murphy is a Democrat, and is considered one of the more politically moderate members of the council. She is running in the 2024 election for the clerkship of the Supreme Judicial Court of Suffolk County.\n\n\n== Early life, family, and early career ==\nMurphy was born and raised in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston. In her adulthood, she has continued to live in the same neighborhood, where she raised her four children. Murphy is a single mother.For twenty years, Murphy worked as a Boston Public Schools teacher in Dorchester. Much of her work was with kindergarten and special needs students. For several years before joining the Boston City Council, she worked as a special education coordinator.Murphy has completed philanthropic and advocacy work on the matter of substance abuse. She ran the Boston Marathon in three consecutive years to raise more than $50,000 for the Gavin Foundation. In 2016, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh recognized Murphy with the \"EXTRAordinary\" award. In 2017, the Massachusetts Commission on the Status of Women gave her their \"Unsung Heroine Award\" for her work.Murphy's grandfather, Richard Murphy, founded the Dorchester United Neighborhood Association and has a public school in Boston named for him. Her sister, Darragh Murphy, is notable for founding People United Means Action (PUMA) to oppose the nomination of Barack Obama as the Democratic Party nominee in the 2008 United States presidential election.\n\n\n== City council ==\nElected in 2021, Murphy serves as a member of the Boston City Council. While the council's elections are nonpartisan, Murphy identifies herself as being a member of the Democratic Party.\n\n\n=== Unsuccessful 2019 campaign ===\nIn 2019, Murphy ran in the election for the four at-large seats on the Boston City Council. Murphy finished the election in sixth-place in the general election, thereby losing.\n\n\n=== 2021 election and partial term ===\nAlongside Ruthzee Louijeune, Murphy was one of two new council members elected to an at-large seat. Incumbents Michael F. Flaherty and Julia Mejia had won reelection, while Michelle Wu and Annissa Essaibi George had each forgone reelection to the city council in order to seek election that year to the mayoralty.Michelle Wu won the coinciding mayoral election. Under the Boston City Charter, a mayoral vacancy sees a new mayor sworn in as soon as is possible after the next mayoral election. Boston's previous permanent mayor, Marty Walsh, had resigned earlier that year to become U.S. secretary of labor, meaning Wu's assumption of office took place in November 2021, earlier than is typical for a mayor and earlier than the expiration of her at-large city council term. The Boston City Charter also specifies that a vacant at-large Boston City Council will be filled by the highest-performing runner-up who accepts the position. The first runner-up (fifth-place finisher) of the 2019 at-large city council election had been Alejandra St. Guillen, who considered serving the remainder of Wu's term before declining the opportunity. Since Murphy had been the next runner-up (the sixth-place finisher), she was given the opportunity to finish Wu's unexpired city council term. She accepted, and was sworn in December 1 to serve the final month of Wu's unexpired at-large City Council term.\n\n\n=== 2022–2023 ===\nMurphy began her first full term city council term on January 3, 2022.\nDuring this term, Murphy joined councilors Frank Baker, Michael F. Flaherty, and Ed Flynn in functioning often as a centrist voting bloc. In September 2023, this bloc signed onto a letter urging that the Boston Public Health Commission hold a vote at their next meeting declaring the situation at Mass & Cass to be a public health emergency. In February 2023, the bloc was joined by Brian Worrell in voting against advancing a home rule petition to make the Boston School Committee a publicly elected school board. Despite their opposition, the ordinance passed 7–5; but it was vetoed by Mayor Wu, who had argued that it was an inopportune moment to make such a transition due to the need to stabilize the state of the city's schools.\nThe informal bloc of Murphy, Baker, Flaherty, and Flynn were the sole votes against the council's redistricting map that was initially approved by the City Council after the 2020 United States Census and which and Mayor Wu passed into law in November 2022. The redistricting process was contentious. The map would have shifted three voting precincts that have historically been predominantly Irish American into a ward that is Black-majority. While noting the Murphy acted civilly in expressing her objections, Yawu Miller of the Bay State Banner characterized the objections as being grounded in \"white grievance politics\". During this dispute, it was noted by Michael Jonas of Commonwealth Magazine that the bloc was not only politically moderate, but also entirely White. After a lawsuit, the map was prohibited by preliminary injunction from being used in the 2023 Boston City Council election after a ruling by Federal Judge Patti Saris, and an interim map was approved by the council and signed into law by Mayor Wu.Murphy voted against a home rule petition that would seek state approval for Boston to extend voting participation in municipal elections to non-citizen residents with legal status.Murphy and Councilor Baker were the sole votes against the rent control home rule petition championed by Mayor Wu.\n\n\n=== 2024–present ===\nMurphy was reelected in 2023, finishing second in the at-large election.Murphy is chair of the council's Strong Women, Families and Communities Committee.Murphy and Councilor Flynn proposed a resolution urging for the city to expand eligibility for Mayor Wu's pilot program providing free admission to museums for Boston Public Schools students and their families, proposing opening up to students who do not attend the city's public schools. Councilor Sharon Durkan had the resolution sent to committee for further consideration, rather than put to an immediate vote, noting that the existing program was still in a pilot phase and arguing that further discussion should be had before voting on the resolution.\n\n\n== 2024 campaign for clerk of the Suffolk Supreme Judicial Court ==\nIn March 2024, Murphy announced that she will in the 2024 election for the court clerkship of the Supreme Judicial Court of Suffolk County. Incumbent clerk Maura Doyle is not seeking reelection.\n\n\n== Electoral history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

In 2021, the comedy series categories were re-arranged into Best Edited Single-Camera Comedy Series  and Best Edited Multi-Camera Comedy Series.\n\n\n== Winners and nominees ==\n† – indicates the winner of a Primetime Emmy Award.\n‡ – indicates a nomination for a Primetime Emmy Award.\n\n\n=== 1990s ===\n\n\n=== 2000s ===\n\n\n=== 2010s ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nAmerican Cinema Editors Award for Best Edited Drama Series\nAmerican Cinema Editors Award for Best Edited Comedy Series for Commercial Television (2017–2020)\nAmerican Cinema Editors Award for Best Edited Comedy Series for Non-Commercial Television (2017–2020)\nAmerican Cinema Editors Award for Best Edited Single-Camera Comedy Series (2021–present)\nAmerican Cinema Editors Award for Best Edited Multi-Camera Comedy Series (2021–present)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

The film is about pigeon racing in Nagercoil, The film was released on 23 February 2024 to highly positive reviews from critics and audience but couldn't perform well at the box office.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film is based on John Glady's short film of the same name that he made for Naalaya Iyakkunar. Locals from Nagercoil played supporting roles.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nA critic from The Times of India rated the film three out of five stars and wrote that \"It is this world building that is the biggest strength of Byri, which has the rootedness of Vetri Maaran's Aadukalam and Vada Chennai (AV Vasantha Kumar's realistic visuals help here), a bunch of raw actors like in Angamaly Diaries, and the energy of City Of God\". A critic from Times Now gave the film the same rating and wrote that \"might get off to a slow start but it certainly does end with a flourish\". A critic from Cinema Express rated the film 2+1⁄2 out of 5 stars and wrote that \"While the majority of the film is fairly engaging, it also unfortunately has some problematic elements that turn out to be major roadblocks. The film, despite revolving around pigeon racing, lacks a genuine love between the men and their birds\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nByri at IMDb",

        "content": "The 1939–40 Athletic-Aviation Club season was one of the most successful seasons in the history of Atlético Madrid. Atlético, who merged with Club Aviación Nacional at the start of the season, on 4 October 1939, won three titles within the next 12 months, the 1939 Campeonato Mancomunado Centro in November, the 1939–40 La Liga in April, and the 1940 Spanish Super Cup in September, although the latter was won in the following season.\n\n\n== Summary ==\n1 April: By the end of the Spanish Civil War, Atlético Madrid found itself in a difficult situation because they were lacking a suitable playing field since the Metropolitano had been completely destroyed by the war, lacking players because its squad had been decimated (including the club's star, Monchín Triana, who was shot down), and it accumulated an economic deficit that envisaged a dark future in its sporting and financial horizon. However, the club managed to save itself from an almost certain disappearance by merging with Club Aviación Nacional, a club that had been founded by three aviation officers.\n4 October: After reaching a pre-agreement in September 1939, the representatives of both sides signed the absorption agreements on 4 October, and appointed the first Board of Directors with Commander Francisco Vives as president of the now Athletic-Aviation Club. Ricardo Zamora was appointed coach of Athletic Aviación, later to become Atlético Aviación.\n5 October: Atlético Aviación played its very first match, the opening fixture of the 1939 Campeonato Mancomunado Centro, which ended in a 1–2 loss to AD Ferroviaria; Julio Elícegui was the author of the team's first goal. Atlético only won one of its first four matches, beating Real Valladolid, but drawing with Imperio CF and losing to Real Madrid CF.\n19 November: Despite this rocky start, however, the team soon found its rhythm and style under the leadership of Zamora, and went on to win each of the remaining six Mancomunado matches, scoring a total of 24 goals for an average of four goals per game while only conceding three, keeping a clean-sheet against both Ferroviaria and Madrid, beating the later on the last matchday on 19 November as they finished level on points, but hedge out Madrid on goal difference, thus winning their first-ever title.\n26 November: At that time, Real Oviedo also had its field destroyed by the war, so it was decided to give up its place to another team, and that final spot was contested by Atlético and CA Osasuna, in a match held in Valencia on 26 November, which Atlético Aviación won with a score of 3–1, with two goals from Enrique and one from Juan Vázquez, thus achieving promotion to La Liga.\n3 December: Atlético Aviación defeated Athletic Bilbao 3–1 in their opening fixture of the 1939–40 La Liga, courtesy of a hat-trick from Enrique, which marked their first-ever win over the Basques in eleven meetings.\nMid-December: After just over two months as the president of the club, Francisco Vives was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Luis Navarro Garnica; José Maria Fernández as vice president, Cesáreo Galíndez as secretary, Paco Campos as technical secretary, José Bosmediano Toril as treasurer, and Juan Touzón as an accountant.\n31 March 1940: The club then reached new heights, surprising everyone by winning their first La Liga title in 1940, just one point ahead of the second-placed Sevilla FC. The league's deciding match was, therefore, the return fixture between these two sides on 31 March, in which Atlético Aviación, who had lost in Seville 1–4, achieved their revenge with a 4–2 victory, courtesy of Paco Campos, Enrique, and Ramón Gabilondo (2).\n28 April: The club officially confirmed the 1940 La Liga title with a 2–0 victory over Valencia CF, with goals from Campos and Elícegui.\n28 May: In the 1940 Copa del Generalísimo, Atlético Aviación received a bye to the round of 16 in which they were set to face Real Zaragoza. As both legs ended in a draw, a tiebreaker was played on 28 May at a neutral ground, the Camp de Les Corts in Barcelona, which ended in a 2–4 loss.\n\n\n== Squad ==\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules. Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\nSource:\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n=== Campeonato Mancomunado Centro ===\n\n\n=== Promotion playoff ===\n\n\n=== La Liga ===\n\n\n=== Copa del Generalísimo ===\n\n\n== Statistics ==\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nIn the following season, in 1940–41, Atlético Aviación won two more titles, the 1940 Spanish Super Cup in September, in which they beat RCD Espanyol 10–4 on aggregate, and the Copa Presidente Federación Castellana, in which they beat Real Madrid 3–1 on aggregate.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Robert Hamilton (6 December 1721 – 9 November 1793) was a Scottish physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHamilton of Lynn, was born at Edinburgh 6 December 1721, and educated at the high school. He was apprenticed to William Edmonston, surgeon-apothecary of Leith, and attended the medical lectures. In 1741 he entered the navy as surgeon's mate, and remained in the service until 1748, occasionally attending the lectures of William Hunter and of William Smellie in London. Having settled at King's Lynn, he acquired a good practice, and was consulted by patients from a distance. He was a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians at Edinburgh, and a member of several other learned societies. In 1773 he sent to the Royal Society of Edinburgh a paper on mumps (printed in vol. ii. of the 'Transactions,' 1790). Another paper, on a case of tapping the bladder per rectum, is printed in the 'Philosophical Transactions,' lxvi. (1776). His longest essay is 'Observations on Scrophulous Affections, with remarks on Schirrus (sic) Cancer and Rachitis,' communicated to the Medical Society of London, but published by himself, London, 1791. He died 9 November 1793. Two works bearing his name were published posthumously, 'Observations on the Marsh Remittent Fever, on Water Canker and Leprosy, with Memoir of the Author's Life' London, 1801, and 'Letters on the Cause and Treatment of the Gout,' Lynn, 1806. In most works of reference he is confused and combined with his contemporary of the same name who practised at Ipswich.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Creighton, Charles (1890). \"Hamilton, Robert (1721-1793)\".

According to the Handbook of Texas, the community had a population of 55 in 2000.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area in what is known as Springdale today was said to be settled in the late 1840s and was originally named Forest Home. A post office was established at Springdale in January 1850 and remained in operation until 1938. John W. Moore served as postmaster. It experienced an interruption after the American Civil War through May 1877. The post office changed its name from Springdale to Forest Home three times throughout the decade, until it ultimately settled on Springdale upon its closure. The heavily wooded community had 75 residents and three sawmills in 1884. The population ranged from 50 to 75 through the 1960s. The settlement had 30 residents served by a church, a cemetery, and two small businesses in 1983 and remained at that level in 1990. The number of residents went up to 55 in 2000.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nSpringdale is located on Farm to Market Road 2327, 5 mi (8.0 km) northeast of Queen City, 9 mi (14 km) northeast of Atlanta, 24 mi (39 km) northeast of Linden, and 16 mi (26 km) southwest of Texarkana in  northeastern Cass County.\n\n\n== Education ==\nToday, the community is served by the Queen City Independent School District.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Bolivar Female Academy was a former women's school in  Bolivar, Hardeman County, Tennessee. \n\n\n== History ==\nThe Bolivar Male Academy opened in 1826 in Bolivar, Tennessee. This first school in town was started by Dr. John Rogers; however, he left Boliver soon after. Its counterpart, he Bolivar Female Academy, opened on the other side of town in 1832. Both schools were supported by tution fees. In December 1840, Levi Joy was president of the Bolivar Female Academy; Mrs. R. C. Berry was hired as its principal, with Mrs. Frances Attwood as her assistant. Rev. L. Jansen was the principal of the Bolivar Female Academy in 1852. \nDuring the Civil War, the town of Bolivar was under military law from 1862 to May 1864. In 1862, the Boliver Female Academy was used as a hospital established by General Stephen A. Hurlbut’s army.\nAfter the war, Rev. W. C. Gray of the local Episcopal church served as the academy's principal. He was replaced by Mary A. Galloway by January 1867. Professor J. W. Graham of Nashville was the principal of the academy in 1872, followed by Mrs. L. W. Cralli in February 1874, E. W. Prince in 1975, and  Mrs. M. J. Thompson in February 1876.\nIn the late 1880s, Bolivar had six private schools, as well as a public school. By 1892, there was community support for a tax for secondary public schools. A new public school was constructed that included four classrooms and a chapel. In the fall of 1896, Professor J. T. Hill was the Bolivar Female Academy's principal. He began a marketing campaign to seek more students, including distributing pamphlets and catalogs.\nHowever, this effort failed and the school closed. Its building was used as a public school. In March and April 1901, a bill was introduced and passed in the Tennessee General Assembly to allow the sale of the school. In August 1901, the Bolivar Board of Education announced the sale of the former Bolivar School for Females. After it was sold, the building was used as a residence. \n\n\n== Campus ==\nBolivar Female Academy was located at the south end of Main Street in Bolivar, Tennessee. Its building was constructed for the school. Initially, Bolivar Female Academy lacked dormitories; T. B. Adams operated a boarding house in Bolivar for the out-of-town students who attended the school.\n\n\n== Academics ==\nBolivar Female Academy was non-sectarian and was not affiliated with a specific church. The school was divided into classes for beginning and intermediate students. Its curriculum included arithmetic, English, French geography, grammar, history, Latin, reading, and spelling. Other classes included drawing, embroidery, painting, and music, including guitar and piano. \n\n\n== Student activities ==\nThe students presented musical entertainment for the community. In June 1866, the students held a strawberry festival that raised $90 for the Monumental Association, an organization formed to erect a Confederate memorial in Bolivar. \nThe academy was home to a Delta Gamma sorority chapter from 1878 to 1881. The students also had field trips, such as a picnic to Dunlap Springs.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Robert Hamilton (1749 – 29 May 1830) was an Irish physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHamilton of Ipswich, was born at Coleraine, co. Londonderry, in 1749, and educated to medicine at Edinburgh. He entered the army as surgeon, and joined the 10th regiment of foot. In 1780 he proceeded M.D. at Edinburgh (thesis 'De Nicotians viribus in Medicina') and probably left the army about the same time. His tract 'Description of the Influenza,' dedicated 28 May 1782 to the colonel of the 10th regiment, shows him to have been then in practice in and near Luton, Bedfordshire. (Munk says he practised first at Dorchester.) He joined the College of Physicians in 1784. In 1785 he was practising at Ipswich, where he resided until his death, on 29 May 1830. His practice came to an end in 1795, owing to total blindness following a rheumatic affection. He is best known as the author of 'Duties of a Regimental Surgeon,' London, 1788, based on his experience in the 10th regiment. It was the first systematic treatise of the kind, and was used by E. B. G. Hebenstreit as the basis of his 'Handbuch' on the same subject, Leipzig, 1790. It was republished in 1798, 2 vols., London, along with his tract on influenza and further remarks on the same epidemic at Luton. His other writings are: \n\n'On the Establishment of a Regimental Fund for the Relief of the Sick . . . Wives of Private Soldiers,' Lincoln, 1783.\n'On the Means of Obviating the Fatal Effects of the Bite of a Mad Dog,' &c., Ipswich, 1785; 2nd edit. 2 vols., London, 1798.\n'Opium as a Poison,' Ipswich, 1791.\n'Rules for Recovering Persons recently Drowned,' London, 1795. A work on the vital statistics of Suffolk, announced in 1800, was not published.\nHe was a warm supporter of civil and religious liberty, and an advocate of the abolition of the slave trade.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Creighton, Charles (1890). \"Hamilton, Robert (1749-1830)\".

        "content": "Nicolaus de Mirabilibus (Italian: Niccolò de' Mirabili; died 1495) was a Transylvanian Dominican preacher and theologian.\n\n\n== Life ==\nNicolaus (or Nicholas) was born into a Florentine expatriate family in Kolozsvár (Cluj), then part of the Kingdom of Hungary. He referred to himself as ex Sepetm Castris, \"from Transylvania\". He joined the Dominicans in Kolozsvár, later transferring to the convent of Košice (Kassa). He moved to Buda in 1478 and later to Italy to continue his studies. He received bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Padua in 1481 and 1483, respectively. He was theologically a Thomist and philosophically a well trained Aristotelian. His writings bear the stamp of a scholasticism out of step with the latest humanist currents.\nNicolaus was named regent successively of the university of Siena (1484), the Dominican studium of Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome (1488) and the studium of Santa Maria Novella in Florence (1488–1489). On 23 June 1489, a public debate between the Franciscans and Dominicans was held in Duomo of Florence on the question of whether or not the sin of Adam was the greatest of sins. On 30 June, Lorenzo de' Medici invited Nicolaus and the Bosnian Franciscan Juraj Dragišić to a banquet in the Palazzo Vecchio to continue the debate. Both philosophers published accounts of the second encounter.\nNicolaus returned to Hungary in 1489. King Matthias Corvinus received a glowing letter of recommendation from Marsilio Ficino on his behalf, in which Ficino calls him Thomas Aquinas reborn: \"Either Thomas has been reborn in Nicolaus, as a Platonist might think, or Thomas at least looks on him with favour from on high and inspires his speech\". He served in 1489 as regent of his alma mater, the studium of Buda. In 1490, he was a preacher at the court of Corvinus. In 1493, he received permission to lecture at the court of King Vladislaus II. In 1493, he became the vicar general of the Franciscan province of Hungary and prior of Buda. He served as an inquisitor for all Hungary from at least September 1493. He died early in 1495, according to a letter of Gioacchino Torriani.\n\n\n== Works ==\nNicolaus wrote three known works:\n\nA Small Book on Conscience (Italian Libello de conscientia), based on a sermon delivered to the nuns of San Pietro Martire in 1488 and written down at their request a few months later. He argues that synderesis (the natural inclination to do good), conscience (the judgement immediately preceding action) cannot err, but that reasoning may err, not in universal matters, but in particular. So:For example reason says: \"no act of adultery is legitimate\". On the other hand it says: \"every act of adultery is enjoyable\". In those common and universal notions reason judges without error. . . But when reason is weaker than sensuality, then it allows itself to be defeated. . . and defeated by sense it will say: \"let us go then to that person\". Reason now will follow the conclusions derived from that true notion: \"every adultery is enjoyable\"; every enjoyable matter is good; and thus going to that woman is good in so far as it is enjoyable.\nA Debate Which Took Place Recently in the House of Lorenzo de' Medici the Great (Latin Disputatio nuper facta in domo Magnifici Laurentii Medices), an account of his debates with Dragišić, printed at Florence on 27 July 1489. Dragišić later wrote his own account, which partially responds to Nicolaus' Disputatio. Nicolaus accused his opponent of heresy.\nOn Predestination (Latin De praedestinatione), also called On Providence (De providentia), based on a sermon preached before Vladislaus II on 23 June 1493. The single manuscript contains a dedicatory letter to Johann von Schellenberg, chancellor of Bohemia, dated September 1493. Nicolaus argues against determinism that humans are free agents who do not act under compulsion, but that God knows in advance how they will freely act:God right from the very outset created man and left him in the hands of his counsels. . . From this it seems easy how the error of the Stoics should be utterly condemned; since they held that everything originates from some necessity according to some indomitable sequence of causes, which the Greeks call \"destiny\".\nHe planned to write a treatise On True Happiness, but it appears it was never written.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBlack-and-white scan from De praedestinatione",

        "content": "John Proudfoot Stratton (2 July 1830 – 8 August 1895) was a Scottish physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nStratton son of David Stratton, a solicitor in practice at Perth, was born in the parish of Caputh, near Dunkeld, on 2 July 1830. He was educated in his native town and afterwards at North Shields, where he was apprenticed about 1840 to Dr. Ingham. He was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1851, bachelor of medicine of the university of Aberdeen in 1852, and M.D. in 1855. At Aberdeen University he gained the medal or a first-class in every subject of study.\nIn May 1852 he gained, by competitive examination, a nomination offered to the university of Aberdeen by the chairman of the East India Company. After holding various posts in the Indian medical service (Bombay) from 1852 onwards, he was appointed in December 1854 residency surgeon in Baroda, where he took an active part in founding the gaekwar's hospital and in vaccinating the native population. In May 1857 he was, in addition to the medical charge, appointed to act as assistant resident. He performed the duties with ability during the trying years of the mutiny, and received the thanks of the resident, Sir Richmond Campbell Shakespear. On the latter's departure for England, Stratton acted as resident until the arrival of Col. (Sir) R. Wallace. In 1859 he was selected to take political charge of Bundelkhand, a district embracing several minor states at that time disordered by bands of mutineers and rebels. His services were again acknowledged by the government, while the company marked its sense of their importance by a special grant of extra pay. He was appointed in 1862 commissioner and sessions judge for Bundelkhand and Baghelkhand, and he was promoted in June 1864 from political assistant to be political agent; while from May to July 1876 he was officiating resident. On 4 March 1881 he was appointed officiating resident in Mewar. In July he was posted to the western states of Rajputana, and on 27 January 1882 to Jeypur in the eastern states. He retired from the service under the fifty-five years age rule in 1885 with the rank of brigade-surgeon. He died at 51 Nevern Square, South Kensington, on 8 August 1895, and is buried in Brookwood cemetery. He married, on 12 April 1859, Georgina Anderson, by whom he had six children.\nStratton did excellent service in his capacity of political agent. He obtained from the native chiefs free remission of transit duties; he personally laid out hill roads; he established the Bundelkhand Rajkumar College for sons of chiefs, and instituted vaccination in Central India.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Power, D'Arcy (1898). \"Stratton, John Proudfoot\".

The province he administered was Corsica and Sardinia. After having been in vain a candidate for consul several times, he was elected consul in 184 BC together with Publius Claudius Pulcher as his colleague. Both consuls waged war against the Ligurians, accomplishing not much of note. During the war, Licinus vowed to Venus that he would build her a temple, which his son (or brother) dedicated in Rome in 181 BC, the Temple of Venus Erycina at the Porta Collina.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Yuhuan City Library (formerly known as Yuhuan County Library, also known as Yuhuan Library) is a county-level public library located in Yuhuan, Zhejiang Province, China, established in August 1978. The old location is at Guangling Road No. 69, Yucheng, Yuhuan, while the new library located in the South Zone of Yuhuan Economic Development Zone is under construction. As of the end of 2016, the total collection of the Yuhuan Library exceeds 300,000 volumes. Currently, Yuhuan City Library is managed by the Bureau of Culture, Radio, Film, Television, Press, and Publication of Yuhuan and is designated as a national first-grade library by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism.\n\n\n== History ==\nDuring the period of the Republic of China, the collection and reading work of Yuhuan County's books was undertaken by the Yuhuan County People's Education Hall. In August 1949, the Yuhuan County People's Cultural Center took over the books of the county's People's Education Hall and opened a 36-square-meter reading room. \nIn August 1978, the Yuhuan County Library was established based on this reading room, and it became independent in 1985. In March 1986, the library established an information service department to provide economic and technical information for townships, enterprises, rural professionals, key households, and rural economic cooperatives in Yuhuan. \nBy 1988, it had established regular data exchange relationships with more than 100 research institutions, colleges, and libraries nationwide, collecting a total of 5,780 internal materials from collaborating units. In 1993, the library moved to its current location on Guangling Road. In October 1999, it was designated as a national second-grade library by the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China.\nIn 2017, with the conversion of Yuhuan County to a city, Yuhuan County Library was renamed Yuhuan City Library. On June 28, 2017, the Yuhuan City Library Council was officially established. On August 13, 2018, it was designated as a national first-grade library by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism.\n\n\n== Building ==\n\n\n=== Guangling Road ===\n\nThe current building located at No. 69 Guangling Road, Yucheng Subdistrict, was built in 1993. The library has four floors: The first floor houses the lending room (with service desk) that provides lending and reading services, an electronic reading room for network queries, and the acquisitions and cataloging department responsible for book procurement and classification. \nThe second floor houses a newspaper and periodical reading room where visitors can freely access publications, a government information disclosure inquiry center, and training classrooms for various training activities. It also accommodates the Information Technology Service Department responsible for technical operations, as well as the office of the library director and secretary. \nThe north side of the third floor is dedicated to a children's reading room, and a reference reading room containing tool books, local literature, and various precious newspapers, including the Siku Quanshu. \nThe fourth floor houses the local literature data department containing Yuhuan Yearbooks, local chronicles, and other local literature, as well as a room for party member activities. Additionally, on the left side of the main entrance, there is an audio-visual material lending room where various audio-visual materials can be freely accessed and borrowed for a fee. The library also features a 24-hour self-service library, an integrity culture learning base, and a reading base for people with disabilities.\n\n\n=== New building ===\nThe new building of the Yuhuan Library is located in the Yuhuan Economic Development Zone (Yuhuan New Town) by the Yuhuan Lake. With a construction area of nearly 10,500 square meters, it consists of a basement and two floors above ground, featuring a frame-shear structure, divided into three venues. The total investment for this project is nearly 58 million yuan. In July 2018, the main construction work of the new library was completed.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nThe Yuhuan Library houses over 800 categories and more than 1800 volumes of local literature related to Yuhuan, such as \"Yuhuan County Annals\", \"Yuhuan Historical and Cultural Artifacts\" and \"Yuhuan Yearbook\". These materials are valuable resources for researching the local history of Yuhuan. In 2002, the library initiated the \"Interlibrary Loan Service\" among public libraries in Zhejiang Province.\nIn 2016, the Yuhuan  Library added over 70,000 new books to its collection. As of the end of 2016, the total collection of the library exceeded 300,000 volumes.\n\n\n== Services ==\n\n\n=== Overview ===\nIn 2016, the total number of book loans and returns in the entire library exceeded 260,000, with a circulation of over 500,000 books, an increase of 8.6% compared to 2015. The financial settlement for 2017 amounted to 21.8746 million yuan. Currently, the Yuhuan Library is under the administration of the Bureau of Culture, Radio, Film, Television, Press, and Publication of Yuhuan, with a total of 19 staff members.\n\n\n=== Digital services ===\nThe Yuhuan Library has launched a network reader service platform, where readers can conduct online catalog searches, book borrowing, and view borrowing history. The library has also established reader communication QQ groups and official Weibo accounts, through which staff members can release relevant information about the library and answer questions.\nIn November 2012, the library introduced the Bokan Humanities and Social Sciences Periodical Database Service. Starting from 2014, efforts have been made to enhance functionality, including converting the old reading room into a 3D movie screening room, purchasing a 3D printer, and acquiring 3D picture books. Currently, services such as borrowing have been automated.\n\n\n=== Various activities ===\nThe Yuhuan Library has conducted 15 book donation activities to rural areas, distributing a total of 7,612 books. In May 2015, the Children's Activity Room was officially opened to the public, and the library, in collaboration with the Yuhuan City Women's Federation, launched the \"Yueyue\" parent-child public welfare class, inviting child experts to give lectures. In September 2016, the \"Dancing with Spirits, Loving Green Taizhou\" photography exhibition \"Little Cui's Story\" was exhibited on the first floor of the library, lasting until October 18, showcasing various photographic works about the blue birds. \nAround the Chinese New Year in 2017, the library also organized a series of activities themed \"Happy New Year, Reader Life\", including parent-child interactive games, film and television cultural salons, New Year's papercutting art lectures, crossword puzzles, exhibitions, and so on. On July 15, 2018, the \"Reading Sound\" reading pavilion located in the Yuhuan Library was officially put into use. Covering an area of about 1 square meter, it has a shape similar to a phone booth. Upon entering the reading pavilion, one can scan the QR code to start reading.\n\n\n== Branches ==\nOn November 5, 2012, the first branch library of Yuhuan City, the Chumen Library, was officially opened to the public, jointly built by the Chumen Town Government and the Bureau of Culture, Radio, Film, Television, Press, and Publication of Chumen County (now the Bureau of Culture, Radio, Film, Television, Press, and Publication of Yuhuan). The Chumen Library is located on the second floor of the Wenling Book Academy in Chumen, with a collection of 10,000 books. It is divided into three parts: the book lending area, the 24-hour self-service book borrowing and returning area, and the children's digital browsing area, with a total area of about 300 square meters. It is managed according to unified standards with the Yuhuan Library and shares books and various digital resources.\nCurrently, the Yuhuan Library has established branches in Qinggang, Chumen, Shamen, Damaiyu Subdistrict, and Kanmen Subdistrict in Yuhuan. On August 31, 2017, a branch was opened at the Chengguan Central Primary School, becoming the first library-school branch in Yuhuan. On May 30, 2018, the Public Security Branch Library was officially established in the Yuhuan Public Security Bureau. As of December 2019, Yuhuan has built 8 township library branches, 9 Hehe Book Bars, and 4 school branches.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\tGallery of photos of the Yuhuan Library\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "William Harty (1781 – 30 March 1854) was an Irish physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHarty was born in 1781, became a scholar of Trinity College, Dublin, in 1799, proceeded B.A. in 1801, M.B. in 1804, and M.D. in 1830 (thesis on the Dublin bills of mortality). In 1805 he published ‘Dysentery and its Combinations,’ a work which shows thoroughness and scholarship, and illustrates philosophically the doctrine of the correlation of dysentery and typhus. A new and recast edition was issued in 1847. In 1808 he was candidate for the chair of botany in Trinity College. He was appointed physician to the prisons of Dublin, and was consulted at Westminster on the Prisons Bill of 1825. In 1820 he published ‘An Historic Sketch of the Contagious Fever Epidemic in Ireland in 1817–1819,’ one of the best works on the causes and circumstances of Irish typhus, with tables and reports for many parts of the country, and a comparison with the great typhus epidemic of 1741. He became a fellow of the King's and Queen's College of Physicians in 1824, censor in 1826, but resigned his fellowship in 1827, to the regret of the college. In 1836 he drew up a petition to the House of Lords on the Irish Church Bill, which he published in 1837, on the advice of the Bishop of Exeter, with notes and an appendix; his contention was that the Protestant reformation had failed in Ireland on account of the poverty of the people and the insufficient endowment of the church establishment. He died on 30 March 1854.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Creighton, Charles (1891). \"Harty, William\".

Plane Jane wins the episode's Tammy Faye Messner-inspired mini-challenge, and Sapphira Cristál becomes the show's first and only contestant to win three consecutive main challenges. Dawn is eliminated from the comepetition after placing in the bottom two and losing a lip-sync against Morphine Love Dion to  \"Body\" by Megan Thee Stallion.\n\n\n== Episode ==\n\n\n=== Mini-challenge ===\n\nThe contestants re-enter the Werk Room following the elimination of Mhi'ya Iman Le'Paige. Morphine Love Dion reads the message  Mhi'ya Iman Le'Paige wrote on the mirror, and the contestants discuss the results of the previous episode's main challenge.\nOn a new day, RuPaul greets the contestants in the Werk Room. RuPaul talks about Tammy Faye Messner and the \"I ran into Tammy Faye at the mall\" T-shirt design, and tasks the contestants with re-creating this look for the mini-challenge. Norvina from Anastasia Beverly Hills makes a guest appearance and invites the Pit Crew to assist. The contestants smear their cosmetics on the T-shirts worn by Pit Crew members. Norvina names Plane Jane the winner, then leaves the Werk Rooom.\n\n\n=== Main challenge and runway ===\nRuPaul introduces the main challenge, which has contestants star in a design show Bathroom Hunties. In pairs, contestants have to build a model bathroom for an \"eclectic\" couple. RuPaul says the space should be gender-inclusive and entertaining. The pairs are Plane Jane and Sapphira Cristál, Dawn and Nymphia Wind, and Morphine Love Dion and Q.\nThe pairs brainstorm in the Werk Room. Morphine Love Dion and Q  consider a \"heaven and hell\" theme, and Plane Jane and Sapphira Cristál like the idea of a speakeasy. The contestants start creating their bathrooms in a backstage area, then return to the Werk Room to prepare for the runway. The group discuss some of their experiences using the bathroom in and out of drag, as well as gendered restrooms in general.\n\nOn the main stage, RuPaul welcomes fellow judges Michelle Visage and Carson Kressley, as well as guest judge Mayan Lopez. The runway category is \"Chain Reaction\". On the runway, Morphine Love Dion's hair is made of chains, and Q's outfit has red chains. Dawn has a draped dress, and Nymphia Wind carries a whip. Plane Jane describes her looks as \"alien sex cyborg\", and Sapphira Cristál presents a BDSM-inspired look. The judges watch Bathroom Hunties, which has three scenes with Kressley and Visage: \"Naughty Potty\" (Morphine Love Dion and Q), which has a tickle torture station; \"F.ART Museum\" (Dawn and Nymphia Wind), which is based on a fine art museum and offers finger painting; and \"Bootylickers Speakeasy\" (Plane Jane and Sapphira Cristál).\nThe judges deliver critiques, then excuse the contestants from the main stage during deliberations. The contestants return, and RuPaul names Plane Jane and Sapphira Cristál the winners of the main challenge. Nymphia Wind and Q are deemed safe. Dawn and Morphine Love Dion place in the bottom and face off in a lip-sync to \"Body\" (2020) by Megan Thee Stallion. Morphine Love Dion wins the lip-sync and Dawn is eliminated from the competition.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Edmund Hollings (1556? – 26 March 1612) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHollings was born in Yorkshire in or about 1556, matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford, in 1573, when he was aged 17, and was admitted B.A. on 7 February 1574–5 (Oxf. Univ. Reg., Oxf. Hist. Soc., II. ii. 56, iii. 49). Renouncing Protestantism, he withdrew to France, and was, 14 May 1579, received into the English College of Douay, then temporarily removed to Rheims. On 21 August of the same year he left the college to proceed on foot to Rome, in company with five other students, who were admitted into the English College there in the following October. Hollings, however, does not appear to have become a member of the college, though he certainly resided there for several years, and became an intimate friend of John Pitts the biographer. An English spy, in his report to the government, stated that Hollings was one of the pope's scholars in the college in 1581 (Records of the English Catholics, i. 358). From Rome he proceeded to Ingolstadt in Bavaria, when he was created M.D. and appointed professor of medicine. He was ‘highly venerated for his great knowledge, and the success he obtained in that faculty’ (Wood, Athenæ Oxon. ed. Bliss, ii. 114). He died at Ingolstadt on 26 March 1612.\nHis works, all of which were printed at Ingolstadt, are:\n\n‘De Chylosi Disputatio,’ 1592, 8vo.\n‘De Salubri Studiosorum Victu,’ 1602, 8vo.\n‘Theses de Medicina.’\n‘Poemata Varia,’ 8vo.\n‘Orationes et Epistolæ,’ 8vo.\n‘Medicamentorum Œconomia nova, seu Nova Medicamentorum in classes distribuendor. ratio,’ 1610 and 1615, 8vo.\n‘Ad Epistolam quandam à Martino Rulando, Medico Cæsario, de Lapide Bezoar; et Fomite Luis Ungariæ,’ 1611, 8vo.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Cooper, Thompson (1891). \"Hollings, Edmund\".

        "content": "Katowicka Street is a street in Warsaw located in Saska Kępa, running from the intersection with Zwycięzców Street to the intersection with Walecznych Street. The name of the street refers to Katowice, the capital of the then youngest Silesian Voivodeship, which fits into the nomenclature of many other streets in Saska Kępa, referring to the new political order after World War I. It is mainly lined with residential buildings, including those from the interwar period, thirteen of which are listed in the heritage register. Several buildings were designed by architects associated with the Praesens group. Katowicka Street also bears traces of an urban experiment from the late 1940s.\n\n\n== Mileage and traffic ==\nKatowicka Street runs parallel to the Vistula river. It is located in the northwestern part of Saska Kępa, between Wał Miedzeszyński and Francuska Street. It begins at the intersection with Zwycięzców Street, then intersects with Obrońców Street, and ends by intersecting with Walecznych Street. The street is one-way, allowing traffic only in the northward direction. There are no public transportation routes or bike lanes running through it.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe history of Katowicka Street dates back to the 1920s when the land in Saska Kępa was drained and divided into plots. The completion of the Poniatowski Bridge also spurred residential development in the area. The name of the street was officially given by the Warsaw City Council on 27 September 1926. The oldest part of the architecture, known as Kolonia Łaskiego, dates back to 1926. From 1928, single-family houses, including those inspired by the latest global architectural trends influenced by designers such as Le Corbusier, began to appear on the street.\nAfter World War II, the villas on Katowicka Street were converted into multi-room apartments, forcibly accommodating tenants in the pre-war owners' residences. Moreover, a section of the street between Zwycięzców and Obrońców (approximately 250 meters) was selected for reconstruction by the Capital Reconstruction Office. The experiment aimed to transform it into a showcase street (\"Street of Warsaw's Future\") by removing fences, introducing greenery, and decorating it with street furniture. According to press reports, the initiative was well-received by residents. The team of architects responsible for the reconstruction, led by Bohdan Lachert, also collaborated with a group of sculptors, mainly residents of Saska Kępa, who worked on their projects voluntarily under the direction of Professor Tadeusz Breyer. The best-preserved decoration from that period is the bas-relief Plon from 1947, which was restored in 2011. Other remnants of the post-war reconstruction of the street include remnants of benches, the external decoration of the staircase in house number 8A, and a few surviving house marks from the Capital Reconstruction Office (plates marking buildings rebuilt with the help of Capital Reconstruction Office). The former layout of the square in front of Plon became an inspiration for one of the projects submitted in 2014 to the participatory budget.\n\nKatowicka Street was also home to the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany, through which around 6,000 citizens of the East Germany attempted to escape to the West in the summer and autumn of 1989. These events were commemorated in 2010 with a monument titled Through Warsaw to Freedom (Polish: Przez Warszawę ku Wolności).\nThe architecture and history of the street are utilized and showcased by public institutions and private companies, including during the organization of urban games.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nMost of the buildings on Katowicka Street are residential houses. An exception is the building of School Complex No. 77, located at the corner of Katowicka and Zwycięzców Streets. The design of the building was created before the onset of socialist realism in Poland (1949) and is the work of Barbara and Hieronim Karpowicz. The facade is covered with characteristic brick decoration (1953–1954). On the wall facing Katowicka Street, there is a bas-relief depicting the Mermaid of Warsaw, created by Wojciech Czerwosz.\n\n\n=== Residential houses ===\nHouse at 2 Katowicka Street – a villa of the Avenarius family from 1937, designed by Stanisław Barylski.\nHouse at 4 Katowicka Street – until 1964, it was the headquarters of the Blood Donation Station.\nHouse at 5 Katowicka Street – a rowhouse from 1937, designed by Stanisław Barylski.\nHouse at 7 Katowicka Street – a house from around 1930, which housed the headquarters of the Capital Reconstruction Office. The building is listed as a historic monument.\nHouse at 7A Katowicka Street – a house belonging to the Avenarius family from 1930, originally designed by Stanisław Barylski, but redesigned by Bohdan Lachert and Józef Szanajca in 1938. During the renovation, a glass staircase was added, which is the first example of using béton brut motif in Poland. The tower wall (bearing traces of WWII bombardment) is topped with a perforated roof. Notable residents included Lech Niemojewski. An illustration of the house at 7A Katowicka Street was featured on the cover of the book Saska Kępa by Hanna Faryna-Paszkiewicz. The building is listed as a historic monument.\n\n\t7A Katowicka Street\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nHouse segment at 8 Katowicka Street – a house from around 1930, listed as a historic monument.\nHouse segment at 8A Katowicka Street – Toeplitz tenement house – from around 1930, designed by Henryk Oderfeld. The facade retains details from the period of reconstruction by the Capital Reconstruction Office – an openwork made by Jerzy Jarnuszkiewicz. The building is listed as a historic monument.\n\n\t8A Katowicka Street\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nHouse segment at 8B Katowicka Street – a house from around 1938 designed by Roman Sołtyński for himself. The building is listed as a historic monument.\nVilla at 9/11/11A Katowicka Street – a triplex designed by Bohdan Lachert and Józef Szanajca from 1928–1929. The villa is one of the first examples in Poland to apply Le Corbusier's five principles of modern architecture. The skeletal structure allowed for flexible interior and facade design. The partially open ground floor was supported by columns. Narrow strip windows were used on the street side, while the rear was glazed, connecting the interior with the garden. Part of the building at number 9 was inhabited by Bohdan Lachert himself, and currently serves as the seat of the Dom Holenderski Foundation. The building is listed as a historic monument.\nHouse at 10 Katowicka Street – a villa designed by Marian Lalewicz from the 1930s. The building lacks historical details, but is distinguished by a glazed, semi-circular living room, with the facade divided by vertical elements. The building is listed as a historic monument.\nHouse at 16 Katowicka Street – a house from the 1920s–1930s, listed as a historic monument.\nSingle-family houses from 17 to 23 Katowicka Street – part of the Łaski Colony from 1926, designed by Włodzimierz Gall. These are rowhouses with common load-bearing walls, forming a cohesive row. On the facade of each is a pediment. Each house has a small porch and gardens. Balconies with wrought iron railings were added to the side facades of corner houses. According to one version, building materials from the dismantled Alexander Nevsky Cathedral were used for construction. The project was reported in Kurier Warszawski in 1930: The entire Łaski Colony looks beautiful and picturesque, especially Obrońców Street, opening up a straight perspective towards Wawer, illuminated by arc lamps, creating a positive impression and providing a foretaste of a future villa district, similar to Poznań's Sołacz.\nHouse at 17 Katowicka Street – a house from around 1930, listed as a historic monument.\nHouse segment at 19 Katowicka Street – a house from around 1930, listed as a historic monument.\nHouse segment at 21 Katowicka Street – a house from around 1930, listed as a historic monument.\nHouse segment at 23 Katowicka Street – a house from around 1930, listed as a historic monument.\nVilla at 26 Katowicka Street – a villa designed by Szymon Syrkus and Helena Syrkus from around 1936 for the Kiltynowicz family. A distinctive feature of the house is the side facade (disturbed by a later-built garage) and the concrete staircase detail from Katowicka Street. Also visible is the typical element of the architectural projects of the Syrkus couple – clinker brick on the plinth with a wide horizontal joint and narrow vertical one. The building is listed as a historic monument.\nHouse at 31 Katowicka Street.\nVilla at 10 Obrońców Street (corner of Katowicka) – villa of the Brzeziński family, designed by Piotr Kwieka from the period after 1935. It is considered one of the most extravagant villas in Saska Kępa. Its characteristic elements include a rooftop terrace (with a canopy with a round opening), portholes, thin columns, and undulating facade lines.\nVilla at 25 Obrońców Street (corner of Katowicka) – villa of Felicja Trębicka, designed by Stanisław Nowicki, completed in 1934. It is an example of Art Deco style with elements (e.g., a tower) referring to defensive architecture. Currently, the building serves as office space. During the Warsaw Uprising, it housed a field hospital.\n\n\tZwycięzców 11/ Corner of Katowicka\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Sculptural decoration and street furniture ===\n\nAlthough the changes introduced on Katowicka Street in the late 1940s were significant, little remains of them today, especially the decorative elements introduced at that time. The fate of the sculptures located there is unknown. They likely fell victim to devastation over the years, or possibly were stolen. Among the missing works are the Bear Playing with a Fish (a fountain made by Jerzy Jarnuszkiewicz), Stanisław Sikora's Bear, Stefan Momot's Boy with a Sailboat, and Józef Trenarowski's Badger. New elements included concrete benches (on stone walls) and park lanterns placed on both sides of the street, lower than the common lanterns (pastorałki) in Warsaw at that time. Remnants from this period include the decoration on the facade of the house at 8A Katowicka Street and the Plon bas-relief (both works by Jerzy Jarnuszkiewicz). Due to the poor condition of the bas-relief, the local community initiated the Around Plon project, which led to its restoration in 2011. Further actions planned under the project include restoring benches and organizing the square at the corner of Katowicka and Zwycięzców Streets. Bench construction began in September 2014, followed by planting greenery. In 2016, the bas-relief and square were awarded the Bohdan Lachert and Józef Szanajca Award for Best Architecture of Saska Kępa in the Public Space and Greenery category.\nPost-war changes on Katowicka Street are viewed differently. Initially, they were heavily criticized, including by Jerzy Baurski in Architektura magazine. Advocates for the changes included Bohdan Lachert, who wrote that the glaring contrasts of snobbery, profit motives, bad taste, shoddiness, and cheap labor were mitigated by composing space between buildings, adopting a common plan for front gardens, introducing greenery, removing fences, and placing decorative sculptures. However, all elements of the new concept did not violate the original assumptions of the architecture represented by pre-war buildings. According to Hanna Faryna-Paszkiewicz, this may have been an attempt to implement such changes to meet demands for democratizing space without violating examples of interwar architecture.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nFaryna-Paszkiewicz, Hanna (2001).

        "content": "Calcha \"K\" is a locality in the Potosí Department in the highlands of the South American Andean state of Bolivia.\n\n\n== Location ==\nCalcha \"K\" is the central place of the Kanton Calcha \"K\" and is located in the Municipio Colcha \"K\" in the Nor Lípez Province at an elevation of 3,697 m (12,129 ft), thirty kilometers south of the salt lake Salar de Uyuni.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nCalcha \"K\" is situated on the Bolivian Altiplano between the Andean mountain ranges of the Cordillera Occidental in the west and the Cordillera de Lípez in the southeast. The region's climate is a typical Tageszeitenklima, where the fluctuation of daily temperatures is more significant than the average seasonal variation of temperatures.\nThe annual average temperature of the region is about 8 °C (46 °F), with monthly average temperatures fluctuating slightly between 4 °C (39 °F) in July and 10 °C (50 °F) in December (see climate diagram Colcha \"K\"). The annual precipitation is just under 100 mm (3.9 in), with notable monthly precipitation of a few centimeters only occurring from December to March; the rest of the year is almost precipitation-free.\nAccording to the climate classification, the climate of Calcha \"K\" is dry and cold (BWk).\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nCalcha \"K\" is located 340 road kilometers southwest of Potosí, the capital of the same-named department.\nFrom Potosí, the paved National Road Ruta 5 leads southwest for 198 kilometers to Uyuni, from there the partially unpaved Ruta 701 continues southwest and reaches the bridge over the Río Grande de Uyuni after 61 kilometers. Behind the bridge, a country road branches off northwest and reaches Julaca after 66 kilometers along the railway line. From there, an unpaved country road leads northwest, reaching Calcha \"K\" after another 15 kilometers.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe population of the locality has increased by about a third in the last decade of the 20th century:\n\nDuring the 2012 census, both the Kanton Calcha \"K\" and the locality of Calcha \"K\" were not listed in the statistics, and it remains to be seen if both will be noted in the upcoming 2024 census.\n\n\n== External links ==\nRelief map of the Cerro Araral Region 1:250,000 (PDF; 9.85 MB)\nMunicipio Colcha \"K\" – Detailed map and population data (PDF; 2.99 MB) (Spanish)\nMunicipio Colcha \"K\" – Overview maps No. 50901\nINE: Archived  at ine.gob.bo \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Ronchamp coal mines adit is a large drainage channel with brick walls. It was used to drain the mine water between 1783 and 1840. It has a section of 70 × 50 cm and is 1.3 km long. It was supplied by the Henri IV shaft and the Clocher adit.\n\nOther mines were opened in the area around 1950. \nIn 1997, the historical mining circuit of the outcrops was created and the exit of the channel was included as a point of interest, together with a more recent dewatering adit. At the beginning of the 21st century, the site was redesigned and a nearby adit that was discovered at the time was restored.\n\n\n== History ==\nWhen coal deposits were discovered in Ronchamp in the middle of the 18th century, concessions were granted and the first adits were opened in the hills above the villages of Ronchamp and Champagney. \nAs the mines were inundated with water and had to be drained, the large drainage channel was dug by the operators from east to west to perform this function, making the extraction work easier and more energy-intensive. \nIt was in use from 1783 to 1840 (when it was abandoned after the end of coal mining in the local adits). When mining moved south of the channel, pumps had to be used to bring the water up to the channel. First with simple wooden buckets, then with primitive pumps made from tree trunks.\n\nAfter World War II, new mines were opened near the channel.\nIn 1952, the Samson shaft was dug near the old shaft of the same name.\nAn unnamed adit was dug next to the large channel.\nA dewatering adit (which quickly sank to a depth of 30 meters) equipped with an electric pump proved inadequate during the flood of December 1950.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe adit has a section of 70 × 50 cm, a length of 1.3 km, and brick walls. It follows a path that crosses the hamlet of La Houillère from east to west, starting under the Chevanel hill, just below the site of the future shaft n°3 on the Champagney territory. The water is discharged into the Fourchie pond in the Etançon forest, near the old Samson shaft.\nIn 1816, a water wheel was installed at the Clocher adit, using a stream from the valley. An artificial pond was built to alleviate the problem of the stream drying up. The Henri IV shaft dumped its effluent into the pond, which was then drawn from the adits by hand pumps and then by ox-drawn pumps operating at a rate of twelve to fifteen pulses per minute, with a flow rate of 1.5 liters per piston stroke. Finally, other hand pumps were used to transfer the water to the channel.\n\n\n== Vestiges ==\nIn 1997, the historic mining circuit of the outcrops was created. The outlet of the channel and the dewatering adit from the 1950s were included as sites of interest.\nThe large drainage channel flowed into the Fourchie Pond, which still existed at the beginning of the 21st century. This pond (now a marsh) was red because it was still filled with water from the pyrite-rich mines. \nAt the end of 2012, the commune of Ronchamp undertook restoration work on the south side of the municipal landfill, which had been converted into a civic amenity site, to bring it up to standard. The people in charge of the work and the members of the Mining Museum Association discovered on the site the remains of mine pipes and an old adit that had been flooded when the land was excavated and that was connected to the outlet of the large drainage channel. There was no trace of masonry in the adit, which was larger than the engineers reported. Research revealed that it was an unnamed post-nationalization adit (1946). After dewatering and draining the mine water, the adit was renovated in the spring of 2013 to make a few meters of it accessible. \nThe woodwork is made of oak planks and boards. Also, it can be seen a pick and an axe, two tools symbolizing the miners, at the entrance.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nMining in France\nRonchamp coal mines\nHamlet of La Houillère\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nParietti, Jean-Jacques (2001).

It is one of six acts enacted by the Energy Security Act of 1980. \nIt addresses geothermal energy legislation by means of the following: \n\nDomestic geothermal reserves could be developed into regionally significant energy sources promoting the economic health as well as the national security of the United States.\nHowever, there were institutional and economic barriers to the commercialization of geothermal technology; and\nFederal agencies should consider the use of geothermal energy for government buildings.\n\n\n== Finance and insurance issues ==\nThe majority of the subsections of the GEA address the financial and insurance issues of geothermal energy production by means of the following:\n\nLoans for geothermal reservoir confirmation,\nThe study, establishment, and implementation of an insurance program, and\nThe establishment of assistance programs.\nPrior to this legislation was the Federal Geothermal Research, Development and Demonstration Act of 1974.\n\n\n== References ==",

The column \"Decl'ns\" below indicates how many war declarations were made in each of those five, totaling eleven.\nThe report cites sources for some of its data with 157 footnotes, as indicated in the \"Footnotes\" column below (mostly for deployments after 2013).\nThe report explains, \"The instances vary greatly in size of operation, [duration,] legal authorization, and significance. ... [I]nclusion in this list does not connote either the legality or the level of significance of the instance described. ... Because of differing judgments ..., other lists may include more or fewer instances.\" Footnote 1 of the report cites three sources of alternative lists, as well as a source for a discussion of the evolution of such lists.\nThe CRS report is updated approximately annually. The data in this article are from version 41, published on June 7, 2023.\n\n\n== List of deployments ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nUnited States military deployments\nList of listings of US military actions\nMilitary history of the United States\nUnited States militarism\nList of revisions and sources of 'Instances of Use of United States Armed Forces Abroad', which is the report that the data in this article are from.\n\n\n== References ==",

P. hubbyi was previously considered a subtype of Phacelia cicutaria but was set apart as a separate species in 2009. Phacelia hubbyi is distinguished by \"a more robust habit, denser inflorescences, absence of mottled marks on the corollas, and longer stamens and styles.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Botne Church (Norwegian: Botne kirke) is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Holmestrand Municipality in Vestfold county, Norway. It is located in the village of Botne. It is one of the churches for the Botne parish which is part of the Nord-Jarlsberg prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Tunsberg. The white, stone church was built in a long church design around the year 1200 using plans drawn up by an unknown architect. The church seats about 240 people.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1398, but the church was not built that year. The stone church was likely built around the year 1200. This stone church originally only consisted of a nave and chancel, probably with a few small windows only on the south side. In 1699 a new church porch was built, and repairs were also made in 1713. In 1865, a major rebuilding of the church was carried out. The nave was extended to the east across its entire width by approximately 4 metres (13 ft), and the choir was extended into the sacristy. The nave's north wall was given a larger second floor seating gallery, and a new gallery was set up on the west wall. The roof was lowered, and a flat ceiling was added (which was removed in 1947). The stone floor was replaced with a wooden plank floor, and the walls were given a new layer of lime plaster. The church previously had 200 seats, and this was expanded to 230 in the nave and 70 in the galleries, for a total of 300 seats (today, the church limits it to 240 seats). A square tower with a church porch and bell tower was also built to replace a smaller tower on the nave roof. Towards the end of the 19th century, the 15th-century frescoes painted on the north wall were covered over with lime plaster. The baptismal font and the pulpit were painted over. The church was restored in 1941–47 (somewhat delayed due to World War II), when, among other things, the frescoes were uncovered once again and the second floor seating gallery on the north wall.\n\n\n== Media gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of churches in Tunsberg\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Richard Hobson (1795 – 29 November 1868) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHobson was born at Whitehaven, Cumberland, in 1795. After school education he was sent to study medicine at St. George's Hospital, London. He became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and finally deciding to become a physician, went to Queens' College, Cambridge, and there graduated M.B. in 1825, M.D. in 1830. In 1831 he settled in practice in Leeds, and on 30 September 1833 was elected physician to the infirmary there, a post which he resigned in 1843. During this period he published in the ‘Medical Gazette’ some notes on diabetes, and on the external use of croton oil. His tastes led him to frequent the turf. He belonged to the Harewood coursing club, bred racehorses, and hunted with the Bramham hunt. For a short time he kept a pack of harriers. He had some knowledge of natural history, and in 1836 became acquainted with Charles Waterton, the naturalist, who lived at Walton Hall, about twelve miles from Leeds. Here Hobson became a frequent visitor and physician to the family. Waterton often wrote to him. Their intercourse ceased a few years before Waterton's death. While it lasted Hobson states that he showed Waterton a memoir which he had written of the naturalist. This statement was not believed at Walton Hall, and the book, ‘Charles Waterton; his Home, Habits, and Handiwork,’ which Hobson published in 1866, contains abundant internal evidence that the statement about Waterton's approval of the manuscript is untrue. Many of the stories in the book are false, the letters given have been altered, and the only faithful parts of the work are the engravings of Walton Hall, some of them drawn from photographs taken by Hobson himself. A fall from his carriage made him an invalid, and while confined to the house he broke his thigh-bone, and died 29 November 1868. His wife, a daughter of Peter Rhodes of Leeds, did not long survive him. He had no children.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1891). \"Hobson, Richard\". In Lee, Sidney (ed.).

It was commissioned by the city of Zürich, and is now held in the Kunsthaus Zürich. There are also several sketches and studies preserved in various museums around the world.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThis canvas is a history painting that illustrates the moment of the Grütli oath, where the delegates of the Swiss cantons of Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden swear to free themselves from the domination of the Habsburgs, on the Grütli  or Rütli meadow, in 1307, creating the Old Swiss Confederacy. The three men are represented with their hands in the center, one above the other, while they look towards the sky raising the other arm. The three characters wear armor and the figure in the center is brandishing a sword. Behind them a ray of light illuminates the cloudy sky.\nThe figures are seen from below and appear elongated, while at the top in the center a supernatural light emerges from the clouds. Fuseli had made a trip to Italy in that period, where he was able to study the works of the mannerists, in particular the works of Parmigianino, Pontormo and Rosso Fiorentino. The work differs from the artistic canons of the late Baroque art, which were the basis for Neoclassical art, then nascent. Fuseli did not outline precise contours for the figures, he used brushstrokes wide and left the background fairly vague. The work is often compared with another famous work of that time, the Oath of the Horatii (1784), by French painter Jacques-Louis David, as both works depict an oath taken by three warriors. However, if the Davidian canvas belongs to the neoclassical style, the work of the Swiss artist is closer to a style that seeks the sublime.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On 18 March 2022, amid the battle for the city of Mykolaiv, during the Russian invansion on Ukraine, Russian Army forces launched an attack on Ukrainian military quarters located at the northern suburbs of Mykolaiv. The quarters were inhabited by servicemen from the 137th Independent Marine Batalion and the 36th Marine Brigade.\n\n\n== Attack ==\nOn 18 March, two Russian Kalibr missiles, fired from either nearby Kherson or Crimea, struck a Ukrainian army barracks of the 36th Separate Marine Brigade (headquartered in Mykolaiv), used to train local soldiers, located in the northern suburbs of Mykolaiv. The attack occurred during the night, while the soldiers were asleep in their bunks. Not enough time was available to sound the alarm, as the missiles were fired from too close, from the vicinity of Kherson.\n\n\n== Casualties ==\nThe Belgian newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws reported that the city morgue and the Ukrainian army stated that at least 80 Ukrainian soldiers were killed, and their bodies recovered. However, the BBC reported that out of the 200 soldiers in the barracks, only one man was pulled from out of the rubble 30 hours after the attack. Another 50 were wounded.\n\n\n== Known Victims ==\nBoyko Andrii Mykhailovych\nMaksim Aleksandrovych Ivanov\nDmytro Ihorovych Darmoroz\nVolodymyr Valentinovych Kryvenko\nShynkaryuk Oleg Petrovych\nMykola Mykolayovych Bolokan\nZadorozhnyi Ivan Volodymyrovych\nEvenko Boris Yuriyovych\nPerejod Eduard Mykhailovych\nAntonenko Evgeny Leonidovych\nVitaly Bargilevich\nIvan Bykov\nYuri Nerubaysky\nNikolai Dudka\nEduard Valentinovych Lavrynenko\nMerkuryev Oleksandr Viktorovych\nOleksiy Mykolayovych Levchenko\nPavlo Gonchar\nMykola Volodymyrovych Korniychuk\nArtur Anatoliyovych Morgun\nLeonid Igorovich Chebotar\nIvan Vasyliovych Lipskyi\nIvanov Valery Serhiyovych\nAnton Rotar\nNakonechny Serhiy Anatoliyovych \nSerhii Olegovich Shyshkovsky\nEvgeny Viktorovych Shpichka\nOleksandr Dyachenko\nKorsya Vyacheslav Vasyliovych\nValentin Volodymyrovych Bagnyuk\nMykhailo Volodymyrovych Skuba\nMykhailo Mykolayovych Kravchuk\nOleksandr Viktorovych Sydorchuk\nVitaliy Yuriyovych Volodko\nDmytro Sergeyevich Uvarov\nIhor Oleksandrovych Shapovalov\nAnton Kostyantynovich\nOleksiy Lunyov \nEvgeny Avramenko\nVarzar Oleksandr\nOleksandr Andreyovych Kholyavko\nVolodymyr Volodymyrovych Galushko\nViktor Grigoriev\nSerhii Mykhailovych Luchko\nDmytro Ihorovych Tsigol\nRotarian Anton\nOganezov Serhiy Serhiyovych\nBlazhko Viktor Viktorovych\nOleksandr Evgenovich Goryachko\nMaxim Melnyk\nOsadchy Teodor Valentinovych\nKravets Vladyslav Vasyliovych\nValery Mykhailovych Samofalov\nPavlo Borysovych Hamyk\nIvan Diskalenko\nDmitry Kiritsa\nAndriy Palamarchuk\n\n\n== See also ==\nYavoriv military base attack - Another attack five days prior\nDesna barracks airstrike - Another deadly attack on Ukrainian quarters\nZarichne barracks airstrike - Another attack on Zaporizhzhia Oblast\nMakiivka military quarters shelling - Deadly attack on Russian forces on New year eve\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Holmestrand Church (Norwegian: Holmestrand kirke) is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Holmestrand Municipality in Vestfold county, Norway. It is located in the town of Holmestrand. It is one of the churches for the Botne parish which is part of the Nord-Jarlsberg prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Tunsberg. The white, wooden church was built in a Y-shaped design in 1674 using plans drawn up by the architect Christian Heinrich Grosch. The church seats about 300 people.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1663, Holmestrand became a small port under the authority of the town of Tønsberg. Soon after, the people of Holmestrand began asking for their own church. Permission was not granted by King Frederick III, but people kept trying. After the king died in 1670, the people asked for a church once again, and the new King Christian V granted permission. The new church was built in 1674. The new church was given a Y-shaped design. The Y-shape was an alternative to the traditional cruciform design where it could sometimes be difficult to look around the corner of the cross arms to see the altar. The Y-shaped design helped solve the problem, although they were very rare in Norway. It was also built during a time when men and women traditionally sat on opposite sides of the church. In this church, the women sat in the north wing and the men in the south wing, while the chancel was in the east wing. Originally, there was a small bell tower built on the center of the roof. The church remained unpainted until 1764, when it received external cladding and paint as well as a new bell tower at the southwestern entrance.\nIn 1814, this church served as an election church (Norwegian: valgkirke). Together with more than 300 other parish churches across Norway, it was a polling station for elections to the 1814 Norwegian Constituent Assembly which wrote the Constitution of Norway. This was Norway's first national elections. Each church parish was a constituency that elected people called \"electors\" who later met together in each county to elect the representatives for the assembly that was to meet in Eidsvoll later that year.\nIn 1829, the church was in such poor condition that it was uncertain whether to repair it or build a new church. Because of poor financial times, however, the parish could not afford a new building, so a major repair was carried out. The church received new windows and doors, a new church porch, and a new sacristy behind the altar. The church also got a new altarpiece and pulpit.\n\n\n== Media gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of churches in Tunsberg\n\n\n== References ==",

Best known for their synth-pop melodies, the original line-up consisted of Alain Seghir (vocals, bass, synthesizer, guitar), Brigitte Balian (vocals, synthesizer, guitar, bass) and Catherine Loy (vocals). Although  Seghir remained the main songwriter the line-up changed with additions including the classically trained musician Beverly Jane Crew (clarinet, saxophone, synthesizer).\nThe band released three critically acclaimed albums; \"Just Because (Facteurs d’Ambiance)\" (1984), \"Sleep Is A Luxury\" (1985) and \"Hot Paradox\" (1987). They broke up in 1988 but steadily developed a cult following over the following decades, and have been sampled by Kanye West, Tricky and Madlib. They reformed in 2022 and toured  the following year.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nJust Because (1984)\nSleep Is A Luxury (1985)\nHot Paradox (1987)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Your Passion\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVideo for \"Love On My Side\", Minimal Wave Records\nMartin Dupon, Bandcamp page",

Edward Hawkins and brother of Cæsar Henry Hawkins and of Edward Hawkins, D.D. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School (1805–12) and St. John's College, Oxford, where he obtained a fellowship. He gained the Newdigate prize in 1813, and in 1816 took a double second class in classics and mathematics. He graduated B.A. 1816, B.C.L. 1819, M.B. 1820, and M.D. 16 April 1823. He was admitted inceptor candidate of the Royal College of Physicians 16 April 1821, candidate 30 September 1823, and fellow 30 September 1824. He became physician to the Middlesex Hospital in 1824, and in 1831, on the foundation of the medical faculty of King's College, London, he was elected the first professor of medicine there. This chair he resigned in 1836, and in 1858 his hospital appointment. He was physician to the royal household in the reign of William IV, and also in the reign of Queen Victoria up to his death.\nHawkins was for many years connected with the College of Physicians, in which he held various offices, and gave the Gulstonian (1826), Croonian (1827–8–9), and Lumleian (1832–4–40–1) lectures, as well as the Harveian oration (1848). But his most important services to the college were rendered as registrar, which office he held for twenty-nine years from 30 September 1829, only resigning it to become registrar of the General Medical Council on its foundation in 1858, in which capacity he remained till 1876. In each of these offices he was very highly esteemed as a good administrator and a courteous gentleman, and in each instance a special vote of thanks, accompanied by a liberal honorarium, was presented to him on resigning office. He died, 13 December 1877, in London. His portrait was in the Middlesex Hospital.\nHawkins was twice married. By his first wife, a daughter of Sir John Vaughan, he left three sons and one daughter.\nHawkins was an accomplished physician, whose genial temperament made him very popular in professional circles, and as a good scholar he was a worthy representative of the old school of university physicians. His Harveian oration in 1848 was admired for its Latin style. He wrote also ‘Lectures on Rheumatism and some Diseases of the Heart and other Internal Organs,’ London, 1826, 8vo.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Payne, Joseph Frank (1891). \"Hawkins, Francis (1794-1877)\".

The 12 episodes of its only series were released on Netflix in March 2023.\n\n\n== Game play ==\nEach episode features four contestants who are asked a series of trivia questions. Contestants can answer them or choose, by subtly pressing a button, to be given the correct answer to say – to cheat. After each question, the other contestants can accuse the answerer of cheating. At the end of the first round, the cheaters are revealed, and the contestant best at detecting cheating gets to eliminate one of the others.\nAfter another round of questions – with cheaters exposed immediately after an accusation this time – the best cheat detector again eliminates another contestant. The remaining two compete in a final round that ends with either the first wrong answer or the first accusation of cheating. If correct, the accuser wins; if wrong, the accused wins.\nEach correct answer added £1,000 to the prize pot, for a maximum potential cash prize of £50,000.\n\n\n== Response ==\nThe show received mixed to negative reviews, with Anita Singh of The Telegraph calling it a \"torturously boring and confusing...Whoever commissioned Cheat was a right mug.\" Joel Keller of Decider rated it a \"Stream It\" (as opposed to \"Skip It\"), but criticised its \"simple premise that's bogged down by complex gameplay...things get way more complicated than they need to be.\" Ally Ross of The Sun wrote that \"if Cheat serves any wider purpose it's to remind us that, despite its veneer of quality, Netflix is, with the odd comedy exception, just row after row of programmes nobody needs to pay for or watch.\"\nThe show was cancelled by Netflix after only one series.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCheat on Netflix\nCheat at IMDb",

        "content": "Corina Yoris Villasana (born 17 March 1944) is a Venezuelan philosopher, professor and politician, who was the Unitary Platform candidate in the 2024 Venezuelan presidential election, as the replacement for María Corina Machado, who was politically disqualified. Yoris was unable to register as a candidate and was temporarily replaced by Edmundo González Urrutia.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Academic career ===\nYoris was born in Caracas and graduated in Letters and Philosophy from the Universidad Católica Andrés Bello (UCAB) in 1980 and 1981, respectively, where she also obtained her PhD in history in 1999. She holds a master's degree in Latin American Literature from Universidad Simón Bolívar (USB) in 1993 and another in Logic and Philosophy of Science from Universidad de Salamanca, Spain. Her final master's thesis, entitled \"Analogy and argumentative force\", was awarded the \"Federico Riu Award for Philosophical Research\" in the category of Short Essay.Yoris held the position of director of the School of Philosophy at UCAB between 1992 and 1998, director of the Philosophy graduate program from 1997 and of the Humanities and Education Area at the UCAB graduate program between 2007 and 2011. She has also been a columnist for El Nacional and a professor at the Universidad Metropolitana.At the institutional level, she has played several roles in both national and international institutions. She was president of the Venezuelan Society of Philosophy and the Venezuelan Society of Logic, member of the Mexican Academy of Logic, member of the Inter-American Society of Philosophy, member of the International Étienne Gilson Society and vice-president for South America of the Ibero-American Philosophy Network (Red Iberoamericana de Filosofía). On 19 March 2024, she was appointed as a full member of the Venezuelan Academy of Language.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nOn 9 November 2022, she was appointed by the Unitary Platform as a principal member of the National Primary Commission, whose function was to organize the primary elections of the opposition coalition ahead of the 2024 presidential election that is scheduled for 28 July.\nMaría Corina Machado, an opposition candidate who was disqualified by the Comptroller General, announced on 22 March 2024 that Yoris would be the presidential candidate for both Unitary Platform and A New Era, the only political organizations authorized by the electoral body to participate in the elections, as well as other sectors of the Venezuelan opposition grouped in the Gran Alianza Nacional (GANA). Yoris, unlike other opposition leaders, has not held public administration positions and is politically qualified according to the National Electoral Council's system. Yoris was unable to register as a presidential candidate and was replaced by temporary candidate Edmundo González Urrutia.\n\n\n=== Political views ===\nYoris is opposed to socialism and communism; she says that the free market regulates prices, that communism was responsible for the death of millions and that the ideology resulted with Venezuela becoming divided.\n\n\n== Academic publications ==\nYoris, Corina (2005).

        "content": "A Great Day in Hip Hop is a black-and-white photograph of 177 hip hop artists and producers in Harlem, New York, taken by photographer Gordon Parks for XXL magazine #7 on September 29, 1998, as a homage to Art Kane's A Great Day in Harlem, photographed in 1958.It was also followed by XXL's \"The Greatest Day in Hip Hop\" in the issue, with the photoshoot having occurred the same day as what was considered a significant release day in hip hop, with Jay-Z, A Tribe Called Quest, OutKast, Brand Nubian, and Black Star, all releasing albums.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1995, Life Magazine commissioned a retake of A Great Day in Harlem gathered ten of the surviving musicians from the photograph, with Parks photographing where they stood. American writer Michael A. Gonzales wrote about the photograph, “As a Harlem boy born a few blocks away from the brownstone where Kane shot the ensemble of jazz musicians, I knew firsthand how much the community had changed in the 40 years since the original picture was taken. That neighborhood had seen it all—from riots and blackouts to heroin and the crack years.”Three years after the photograph, 177 participants were assembled, including rappers, producers, and influencers, on the stoop of brownstone number 17. The photograph would represent the following generation, giving a new touch to the 1958 photograph. Various rappers including the Beastie Boys, Big Pun, Public Enemy, KRS-One, and most members of the Wu-Tang Clan were invited to attend, but did not attend or cancelled the invitation.\n\n\n== Musicians in the photograph ==\nAll musicians are linked from XXL #7 page 110\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nA Great Day in Hip Hop received national attention through the XXL magazine, paving the way for many shoots in various cities including Atlanta, Los Angeles, Detroit, and Houston, the following years.The following year, West Coast rappers gathered together for a photo shoot known as A Day in the West in Los Angeles, with rappers including Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Cypress Hill, Warren G, DJ Quik, King T, and more present.In 2005, MTV would organize an event for Atlanta's most notable rappers including Ludacris, T.I., Young Jeezy, Killer Mike, and DJ Drama.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Richard Haydock (fl. 1605) was an English physician. He had the first recorded use of the term \"cowlick\" when he used it in his translation of Gian Paolo Lomazzo: \"The lockes or plaine feakes of haire called cow-lickes, are made turning upwards.\"\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHaydock was born at Grewel in Hampshire. He was educated at Winchester College, and on 12 July 1588 matriculated at New College, Oxford, of which he was elected a fellow in 1590; he graduated B.A. 16 January 1592, proceeded M.A. 31 October 1595, and M.B. 14 June 1601 (Oxford Univ. Reg. vol. ii. pt. ii. p. 165, pt. iii. p. 169, Oxford Hist. Soc.) He travelled for some time on the continent, whence he returned to Oxford to study physic. In 1605 he left the university and settled in Salisbury, where he practised as a physician for many years. Arthur Wilson (Hist. of Great Britain, ed. 1653, p. 111) says that Haydock used to see visions in the night; that he would select a text in his sleep, and discourse on it in spite of pinchings, generally denouncing the pope and high church practices. He was summoned to court to exhibit his powers before the king, when he acknowledged himself an impostor, and, after a public recantation, was pardoned by the king, who offered him preferment in the church. Haydock did not, however, take orders, ‘but lived always a physician of good repute at Salisbury, and, retiring for a time to London, died, and was buried there, a little before the grand rebellion broke out’ (Wood).\nHaydock's only publication is ‘A Tracte containing the Artes of curious Paintinge, Carvinge, and Buildinge, written first in Italian by Gian Paolo Lomazzo, painter of Milan, and Englished by R. H., student in Physik,’ Oxford, 1598, fol. It is dedicated to Thomas Bodley, esq., the founder of Oxford's ‘Pambiblion, or Temple to all the Muses.’\n\n\n== References ==\nSpecific\n\nGeneral\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Jacob, Thomas Evan (1891). \"Haydock, Richard (fl.1605)\".
