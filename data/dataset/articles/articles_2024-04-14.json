        "content": "The Warsaw Half Marathon (Polish: Półmaraton Warszawski) is an annual road-based half marathon hosted by Warsaw, Poland, since 2006.  The marathon is a World Athletics Label Road Race and a member of the Association of International Marathons and Distance Races.  A 5K race is also held on the same day, before the half marathon.\nThe half marathon is the second-largest footrace in Poland by number of finishers, after the Polish Independence Run in Warsaw.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe inaugural event was held on 26 March 2006.  Nearly 1,100 people took part in the half marathon, which was won by Kenyan runner Michael Karonei and Polish runner Małgorzata Jamróz, with finish times of 1:04:12 and 1:14:47, respectively.\n\n\n== Course ==\n\nThe half marathon runs on a point-to-point course that begins and ends outside Stadion Narodowy.  The course starts at the eastern end of Poniatowski Bridge south of the stadium, and ends near the Warszawa Stadion railway station north of the stadium.\nRunners first head west to cross the bridge over the Vistula River.  The course then heads north, past Castle Square, up to the northern border of the neighbourhood of Marymont, around where the halfway point is crossed.  Runners then head back south and pass the Warsaw Citadel before crossing the Vistula again, at Gdańsk Bridge.  The course then continues south, passing the Warsaw Zoo before finishing outside the stadium.\n\n\n== See also ==\nWarsaw Marathon\nWarsaw Marathon (Orlen)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site",

        "content": "The 3dom Factor is an album by drummer Barry Altschul on which he is joined by saxophonist Jon Irabagon and double bassist Joe Fonda. The trio's inaugural release, and Altschul's first session as a leader following a hiatus of roughly 25 years, it was recorded on June 15, 2012, at Sear Sound Studios in New York City, and was issued on CD in 2013 by TUM Records.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nIn a review for The New York Times, Nate Chinen wrote: \"these musicians cohere mightily, swinging fast or free. The compositions, all but one by Mr. Altschul, suggest compact studies in durable melody... Mr. Altschul sounds acutely engaged, the force of his attention giving the album much of its power.\"\nWNYC's Patrick Jarenwattananon noted that the musicians \"straddle the lines between uptempo bebop and free improvisation with authority,\" and stated: \"The 3dom Factor is ultimately Altschul's showcase,which he uses to demonstrate a wide range of styles... It's his music, too: The band reinterprets original compositions from throughout his discography... They're tuneful and worth paying attention to.\"\nA reviewer for NPR's Fresh Air commented: \"Altschul is great at mixing opposites: abstract melodic concepts with parade beats, open improvising and percolating swing. The album is the sort of comeback that reminds you how much good music the artist made the first time around.\"\nJohn Garratt of PopMatters called the album \"a combination of [Altschul]'s past and present,\" and remarked: \"The new tunes are brand new and the old ones get young treatment... Altschul, Irabagon and... Fonda keep the train going full steam ahead.\"\nWriting for Point of Departure, Brian Morton noted that it is \"pretty clear that the Altschul of 2012 is a different fellow to the Altschul of 1972 or 1982... The exciting thing about this recording and some of its predecessors is how much Altschul has changed... it's possible to argue that Altschul is the great outsider of modern jazz; but he's just outside, he's in the courtyard or listening through the wall rather than off in some howling waste, crying over his marginalization. It's very affectionate music, this. Very clever and sly.\"\nIn an article for All About Jazz, Mark Corroto wrote: \"The trio spins a mixture of inside and outside playing... Where another drummer would surrender time to free jazz, Altschul keeps the music rooted between post-bop and free.\" AAJ's Troy Collins described the album as \"a compelling overview summarizing his entire career,\" and stated: \"Bolstered by the laudable contributions of his sidemen, the record is both a modern masterpiece and a singular highlight in an impressive discography.\" AAJ writer Eyal Hareuveni called the album \"highly enjoyable and inspiring,\" and highlighted Altschul's notable qualities: \"The instant, authoritative, assertion of pulse and form, the ability to color it with wise and subtle usage of cymbals and rubbed drum heads, instinctual communication and emphatic rapport with musical partners and boundless energy.\" Reviewer Glenn Astarita commented: \"With torrid flows, unanticipated detours and gobs of group-centric synergy, the trio looms as a tightly wound machine, and loosens it all up via spurious improvisational segments and fluid trajectories amid a consortium of cleverly articulated counter-maneuvers.\"\nKen Waxman of Jazz Word remarked: \"this first-rate CD... proves that when it comes to the creative musician, age is just a number... it's accord and experience which account for the sympathetic interaction here... Cooperative fluency is apparent throughout... A sophisticated and conscientious drum stylist matched with a sympathetic band, the only noise associated with this session will be the huzzahs from satisfied listeners.\"\nThe Free Jazz Collective's Paul Acquaro wrote: \"Altschul's playing is direct, driving and sets a new expectation of how percussionist can interact with the players mediating between pulse, melody and texture... it seems that Altschul is quite active again, and 3Dom Factor is a joyful statement and a nice entry in his discography.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Ictus\" was composed by Carla Bley. Remaining tracks were composed by Barry Altschul.\n\n\"The 3dom Factor\" – 5:17\n\"Martin's Stew\" – 5:59\n\"Irina\" – 6:11\n\"Papa's Funkish Dance\" – 4:52\n\"Be Out S'Cool\" – 5:53\n\"Oops\" – 5:46\n\"Just a Simple Song\" – 5:50\n\"Ictus\" – 2:24\n\"Natal Chart\" – 4:43\n\"A Drummer's Song\" – 3:22\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nBarry Altschul – drums, percussion\nJon Irabagon – tenor saxophone\nJoe Fonda – double bass\n\n\n== References ==",

His primary field is multiculturalism in post-communist countries, including the former Yugoslav republics.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nAdam Khaze was born in Iran. He immigrated to Australia in 1988 as part of the Government's immigration program for members of the Baháʼí Faith. He holds a law degree from the Australian National University in Canberra and an economics degree from Curtin University in Perth. He completed his postgraduate studies in immigration law at Victoria University in Melbourne.Khaze built his career as a legal and economic advisor. Over time, he started helping his compatriots, as well as others, to legally immigrate to Australia. Today, he mainly deals with so-called \"complex migrations.\"In his works, Khaze analyzes the consequences of the White Australia policy, the official Australian immigration policy from 1901 until the years after the Second World War. According to Khaze, immigrants from Asia and the former Yugoslavia formed two defining waves that changed Australian regulations and paved the way for changing the composition of the population, contributing to the multicultural society.He is the founder of the Sydney-based company Solve Migration.In 2024, Adam Khaze is included in the Encyclopedia of the National Diaspora, edited by chronicler Ivan Kalauzović Ivanus.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nFleeing Communism – Yugoslav and Vietnamese Post-War Migration to Australia and Changes to Immigration Policy (Springer Singapore, 2020)\nComplex Migrations (Impressions Publishing, 2024)\n\n\n== References ==",

Originally inaugurated in 1578, it has since been retouched and serves as the square's main feature, itself featuring a statue of Pheme, one of the gods of Ancient Greece.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first fountain built in the square was ordered to be built by Viceroy Francisco de Toledo and was inaugurated on October 21, 1578. It consisted of a baluster and a bowl, and in it eight masks with their pipes through which the water fell into the largest cup. On top of the cup there was a ball, which released all the water to fall on the cup. Above the ball was a figure of Pheme with a shield on one side with the arms of the city. In its hand was a flag and the arms of Viceroy Toledo was sculpted on it. The finishing of the overcup was made by the silversmiths Miguel Morcillo and Juan Ruiz. An unpublished record of the Cabildo of Lima corresponding to the year 1630 states that in addition to the coats of arms of Lima and Toledo, the fountain had the coat of arms of Spain and that of Francisco Pizarro.\nThis pool was replaced by another commissioned by the Viceroy Count of Salvatierra, and inaugurated on September 8, 1651, which, with some renovations, remains to this day. Its design is due to the sculptor Pedro de Noguera.\nIn 1900, Federico Elguera, then mayor of Lima, had the square renovated, including the fountain. During these works, the angel fell and broke, eventually disappearing. As a result, a replica replaced it in 1997.\nRestoration works took place in 2015 after complaints regating the fountain's state.\nIn 2018, the fountain was filled with Pisco to commemorate its national day, which was served to all visitors to the square on that date. Up to 1,500 litres were used in the fountain.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPlaza Mayor, Lima\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Holy Trinity Church is an Anglican church in Barkston Ash, a village in North Yorkshire, in England.\nUntil the mid 19th century, the village did not have a place of worship, but instead fell into the parish of All Saints' Church, Sherburn in Elmet.  In 1869, the vicar of Sherburn was licensed to officiate in a house in the village, but he was unable to administer the sacraments there, and so a dedicated chapel-of-ease was constructed, to a design by William Bakewell.  The foundation stone was laid on 13 October 1873, with more land acquired the following year.  The building was completed in about 1880.  A pipe organ was installed in 1907, and electricity came to the church in 1939.\nIn 1974, the chapel was consecrated as a church, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, although it remained in the parish of Sherburn.\n\n\n== References ==",

Originally a spring, it serves the headquarters of SEDAPAL, the city's water treatment company that also services Callao.\n\n\n== History ==\nLa Atarjea was originally a spring located in the eastern outskirts of the city of Lima, behind Presbítero Maestro Cemetery. People from Lima drank their water straight from the Rímac River until 1552, when local authorities began looking for alternate sources. An acqueduct was built in 1563 to supply the fountain at the Plaza Mayor and the city's convents.\nOn December 24, 1953, a freight train of the Ferrocarril Central Andino headed for Lima derailed next to the area, killing seven people.\nIn 1955, the government of Manuel A. Odría signed a contract with Degrémont in order to construct a proper treatment plant in an 11-month period with a capacity of 5 m3/s, the largest of its time. In the following decade, its capacity was increased to 7.5 m3/s.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSEDAPAL\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "All Saints' Church is the parish church of Brompton, a village near Scarborough, North Yorkshire in England.\nThe church is most famous as the location where, in 1802, William Wordsworth married Mary Hutchinson.  In 2002, a festival celebrated the 200th anniversary of the wedding.\nThere was a church on the site by the 12th century.  The oldest parts of the current building are the tower and nave, which date from the 14th century, although some fragments of the earlier building are incorporated into it.  The arcade, south aisle and chancel were added in the 15th century.  The church was restored in 1878, and the south porch was added in 1895.  The building was grade I listed in 1967.\nThe church is built of sandstone with a slate roof.  The steeple has a tower with three stages, large diagonal buttresses, a northeast stair turret, and bell openings with ogee-headed lights and pointed hood moulds.  On the tower is an octagonal broach spire with lucarnes and a weathervane.  There are embattled parapets on the porch, the aisles and the chapel, and in the nave and south wall of the chancel are three-light Perpendicular windows. The walls of the church contain re-set Norman fragments, notably including two figures of women, one seated, who may represent the Virgin Mary.  Inside, the gallery and organ case date from 1893 and were designed by Temple Moore.  The font is circular and is 13th century.  There are several monuments, including a tablet of 1580, and a wall brass from 1688.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGrade I listed buildings in North Yorkshire\nListed buildings in Brompton, east North Yorkshire\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ramsay Hill (born Cyril Seys Ramsay-Hill; November 30, 1889–February 3, 1976) was a British radio and film actor, and a former British and Egyptian army officer, whose military experience and multilingual proficiency helped make him a much-in-demand technical advisor and dialogue coach in Hollywood.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nBorn in Georgetown, Guyana, Ramsay Hill was the child of John Ramsay-Hill and Rosalie Vansolsman. He obtained a degree in Chemistry from Brighton Technical School in 1909, and served with the Royal Buckinghamshire Hussars in World War I.Speaking more than two decades after his death, actor Parley Baer—who had appeared with Ramsay Hall at least once on one of the most popular old-time radio anthology series—recalled that his late colleague was \"a good actor who put a lot of imagination into the parts he was given.\" Regarding his performance as John, Prince of England in Cecil B. DeMille's The Crusades, Pittsburgh Sun Telegraph critic George Seibel wrote that, amidst the film's many romantic episodes and spectacular combat sequences, the \"best acting of the spectacle\" is done by Ramsay Hill and Joseph Schildkraut—as the Marquis of Montferrat—while playing a game of chess.In contrast to his film career, consisting primarily of small, often uncredited roles overshadowed by his crucial and relatively well-publicized contributions as a technical consultant, Ramsay-Hill had a lengthy radio acting career including many substantial roles, some of the most notable being Roderick Usher (from Poe's \"The Fall of the House of Usher\"), Godfrey Ablewhite (in Wilkie Collins's The Moonstone), Merlin in Mark Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, and the title character in the NBC University Theatre production of Eric Knight's short story \"The Old General.\"\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nRamsay-Hill became a naturalized United States citizen on May 23, 1952, at the age of 62. He was married at least four times, the second being to Edith Mary Agnes Hughes (née Maude), beginning on November 22, 1924, and continuing until their divorce on Jun 18, 1928. The third marriage, commencing on December 17, 1930, was to Patsey Morris (daughter of writer Gouverneur Morris), with whom Ramsay-Hill had one son, John, and to whom he remained married at least until February 1949, at which time it was reported that the couple resided on Foothill Boulevard in Pasadena. The younger Ramsay-Hall had a brief career as a child actor on radio before committing suicide in 1957 at age 19, reportedly due to a failed love affair. By that point, Ramsay-Hill and Morris had evidently divorced, as the Los Angeles Mirror lists the deceased's parents as Cyril Ramsay-Hill and Patsy Splane.On February 3, 1976, having fallen seriously ill more than two months prior, Ramsay-Hill died of undisclosed causes at the Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys, survived by his wife Polly Ramsay-Hill. His remains are interred at Valhalla Memorial Park in North Hollywood.\n\n\n== Radio ==\n\n\n== Film and television ==\n\n\n=== Acting ===\n\n\n=== Additional crew ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"When Patsy and the Lonely Major Were Marooned on the Island of Love\".

        "content": "Harvey Kronberg (born 1950) is a Texas journalist who owns and edits the Quorum Report an online publication covering Texas politics. In 2005, Texas Monthly named Kronberg as one of the 25 most powerful people in Texas politics.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nKronberg is from Houston and graduated from Bellaire High School in 1968, then went to the University of Texas at Austin, graduating in 1972.  After graduation, he worked for several years as a licensed auctioneer and by his own account he \"worked really hard at being a hippie,\" reading Marx, and peddling clothes at flea markets.  However, within a few years he had become a committed businessman, with a strong interest in politics. He and his wife Michele have been together since 1975.\n\n\n== The Quorum Report ==\nKronberg began his Texas politics career as a contract writer for the Quorum Report in 1989. Founded in 1983, the publication is Texas' oldest political insiders newsletter. In 1998, Kronberg acquired the Quorum Report, converting into an exclusively online subscriber based publication covering Texas politics and government, targeted to the political professional.  By 2005, Texas Monthly declared Kronberg one of the 25 most powerful people in Texas politics and dubbed him the \"Capitol's scribe\", stating that the Quorum Report had \"become required reading for Austin politicos\". \nThe publication has long been the \"go-to\" publication of insider Texas politics, and Kronberg the insider's insider.\nHarvey Kronberg and his team at the Quorum Report were early Internet news pioneers. Within a year of purchasing The Quorum Report, then a print-only political newsletter, they had turned it into a successful all-web news operation.  Although much of the online content was given away for free, Kronberg kept much of the \"good stuff\" behind a limited paywall, inducing political junkies to subscribe.\nThe Quorum Report has been quoted in publications such as Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Dallas Morning News, The Houston Chronicle, Congressional Quarterly, Christian Science Monitor, among others.\n\n\n== Professional life ==\nIn addition to owning and operating the Quorum Report, Kronberg launched a sister site, The Texas Energy Report, an online publication focused on politics and Texas's energy industry.\n\nKronberg is also a political analyst for Spectrum News. Kronberg makes regular appearances on the channel's Capital Tonight program and also appeared on the weekly political commentary show, \"On the Agenda,\" when the network was owned by TimeWarner.\nKronberg conducts the annual auction for the Wine and Food Foundation of Texas and serves on their board.  He also conducts auctions for the Heartgift Foundation and the Austin Lyric Opera. He and his wife, Michele, started the Austin Flag and Flagpole company in 1986. It is the largest full service flagpole company in Central Texas.\n\n\n== External links ==\nQuorum Report Official Website – https://www.quorumreport.com/\n\n\n== References ==",

It is a place of passage for many hikers who cross it via the GR6, Mont Gaussier was very early used as a habitat by protohistoric populations, before seeing a medieval castle at its summit, which has now disappeared.\n\n\n== Geology ==\nMont Gaussier is made up of crystalline, white, hard limestone. Traces of numerous fossils can be found in the ground. This type of summit is characteristic of the Alpilles, particularly on the north face.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first traces of human habitation on Mont Gaussier can be traced back to ancient times. In 1996, at least three habitation sites dating from Protohistory and Late Antiquity were discovered at the summit and on the slopes. This is what is revealed by the study of rubble stones, tiles, ceramics and amphora shards found on the site. In addition, the base of a wall was identified at the summit.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Lima Drinking Water and Sewer Service (Spanish: Servicio de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado de Lima), also known by its acronym SEDAPAL, is a Peruvian state-owned enterprise created in 1962. It manages the drinking water supply of the metropolitan area of Lima and Callao. The water it supplies is treated in La Atarjea in El Agustino, and supplies more than nine million inhabitants of Lima.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nOn December 21, 1578, water reached the fountain in the Plaza Mayor for the first time. From then on, the waters of the La Atarjea springs were used. The population of Lima was supplied with pylons.\nIn 1855, a group of Peruvian businessmen, with the support of President Ramón Castilla, organized a commercial entity that changed clay pipes for cast iron pipes in Lima. Later, this entity was transformed into the Drinking Water Company (Spanish: Empresa de Agua Potable), which administered the service until 1913. That year, the Superior Council of Drinking Water of Lima (Spanish: Consejo Superior de Agua Potable de Lima) was formed, later called the Municipal Board of Drinking Water of Lima (Spanish: Junta Municipal de Agua Potable de Lima).\nIn 1918, this institution undertook the construction of the La Menacho (El Agustino) reservoir with the application of alumina to the water and the expansion of the distribution network.\nIn 1920, the Lima Drinking Water Board (Spanish: Junta de Agua Potable de Lima) was established and in that same year, the Municipality of Lima handed over the administration of the water service to The Foundation Company, later passing it to the Public Works Directorate of the Ministry of Public Works.\nIn 1930, the Superintendency of Drinking Water of Lima (Spanish: Superintendencia de Agua Potable de Lima) was formed, as a dependency of the Ministry of Public Works and Development. The first Water Treatment Plant was also built, which came into operation on July 28, 1956.\n\n\n=== Later years ===\nOn June 8, 1962, the Lima Sanitation Corporation (Spanish: Corporación de Saneamiento de Lima, Cosal) was formed. This is the date on which the company celebrates its anniversary, when the first public sanitation company with administrative and financial autonomy was formed.\nSeven years later, on March 21, 1969, Cosal was restructured and the Lima Sanitation Company (Spanish: Empresa de Saneamiento de Lima, ESAL) was formed as a decentralized public body of the Ministry of Housing.\nOn June 12, 1981, the National Service for Drinking Water Supply and Sewerage (Spanish: Servicio Nacional de Abastecimiento de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado, SENAPA) was created, modifying the structure and function of ESAL, establishing the Service for Drinking Water and Sewerage of Lima (Sedapal) as a subsidiary company of Senapa. During those years it absorbed the municipal water companies of Callao and Ventanilla.\nIn 1992, Sedapal became dependent on the Ministry of the Presidency as a state-owned company, under private law with technical, administrative, economic and financial autonomy. In 2002, after the ministry was deactivated, Sedapal became dependent on the reactivated Ministry of Housing, Construction and Sanitation.\n\n\n=== Recent history ===\nIn recent years, Sedapal carried out important works that improved the water supply for all the residents of Lima and Callao: Inlet No. 2 was built, the second stage of the Drinking Water Treatment Plant No. 2, the regulating pond No. 2, 12 sand traps, the Induced Recharge of the Rímac Aquifer and the new treated water reservoir with a capacity of 52,000 cubic meters.\nIn addition, other works were carried out to improve the water service in Lima: Mark III, Use of the Surface and Underground Waters of the Chillón River, the installation of ten large matrix networks to improve the water supply.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRímac River\n\n\n== References ==",

The framework functions with a Rust back-end and a JavaScript front-end WebView using rendering libraries like Tao and Wry. Tauri was released as a less bulky alternative to similar existing frameworks such as Electron.\nTauri 1.0 was released in June 2020. In 2024, Tauri v2 Beta was released, which includes mobile support for iOS and Android systems.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nCentral to Tauri's architecture are core components such as the Tauri crate, which serves as a hub for managing various functionalities like runtimes, macros, utilities, and APIs. The toolkit also includes essential tooling such as bundlers, CLI interfaces, and scaffolding kits, to streamline the development and deployment processes. Tauri supports cross-platform application window creation (TAO) and WebView rendering (WRY), which allows compatibility across macOS, Linux and Windows platforms.\nTauri is built using Rust, which is known for its speed and security due to its memory safety features. It also allows users the function to switch individual APIs on and off, and provides an isolation pattern to prevent untrusted scripts from accessing the back-end from a WebView.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Macinka accused the Pirate-led coalition in the city of bullying of drivers and called them \"green fanatics\".\nMotorists gained 540,209 votes, reaching 2.29% of the total vote, thus missing on the 5% electoral threshold and winning zero seats in the Prague City Assembly.\n\n\n=== 2024 European Parliament election ===\nFor the 2024 European Parliament election, the party was firstly considering a joint electoral list together with Svobodní. However, the party later announced a coalition with the Přísaha movement, with their joint list being led by a former automobile racer Filip Turek. The coalition wants to reverse the European Green Deal and the ban on sale of patrol and diesel cars starting from 2035.

        "revision_id": 1219483971,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Moses ben Abraham (fl. 1244) was a French Jewish author and translator.\nHis only known work, the Chroniques de la Bible, is an Old French historical and prophetic compilation based Hebrew sources. It contains a partial translation of the Sefer Yosippon. Based on this and biblical sources, it gives an overview of ancient history down to 8 BC. Its prophetic section is based on the Bible and Moses' own interpretations. He predicts the coming of the Messianic age in 1290–1335.\nThe Chroniques is known from a single illuminated manuscript of the late thirteenth century.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMoses is known solely from the single manuscript of his Chroniques. He refers to himself as \"moyses fils abraham, le rous le yuif\", \"Moses, the son of Abraham, the redhead and Jew\". He gives the date of his writing as 1244.Moses was triliterate. The Chroniques is an original composition in Old French that contains extensive translation from Hebrew. In a few places Moses quotes from the Latin Psalter before providing a translation and gloss, indicating that he had knowledge of Latin also. Although a few passages have a \"Christian ring\", there is no evidence that Moses was a convert.Moses is depicted in the manner of a philosopher in a historiated initial at the start of his work. His face and hands are partially erased, perhaps by rubbing. He is wearing a pink bonnet and a white rouelle (roundel) on his robe, both indicators of his Jewishness. The rouelle is a distinctly French badge introduced by Bishop Eudes de Sully.\n\n\n== Chroniques ==\n\n\n=== Patronage ===\nThe prologue begins by naming the patron who commissioned the work:\n\nThe count of Auvergne in 1244 was William X (r. 1222–1247), who is generally taken to have commissioned the work. Maria Theresa Rachetta, however, suggests that the Chroniques is \"too eccentric for a layman of modest means who lived most of his life on a restricted territorial allowance\" and proposes that the word \"quens\" (count) is an interpolation. In her view, the original patron was William of Auvergne, bishop of Paris.\n\n\n=== Content ===\nThe title Chroniques de la Bible is found in a colophon. The explicit labels the text \"la bible en franchois\" ('the Bible in French'). An addition made to the manuscript in lettre bâtarde in the fifteenth century describes it as \"la descricion veritable de Josephus par forme de chroniques\" ('the true description of Josephus in the form of chronicles'). Moses, in the prologue and in a few other places, refers to his work only as the Livre, 'book', which is the title adopted by Maria Theresa Rachetta.The purpose of the Chroniques is given in the prologue. Moses' patron wanted \"to know the beginning and the unfolding of the lineages since the creation of the world, as well as the battles which were fought in ancient times.\" To this Moses has added much speculation on the future of the world. Chronologically, the work begins with the generations of Noah and ends in 8 BC during the reign of Herod the Great.According to Moses, Francion, the founder of the Frankish nation, was a son of Gomer, son of Japheth. This contradicts the then popular legend of the Franks' Trojan origins. Moses then discusses the histories of the ancient Babylonian and Persian empires, drawing mainly from the biblical books of Daniel and Esther. He follows this with a description of 27 books of the \"donated testament\" (i.e., the Jewish Bible), a brief description of Christianity based on the books of the New Testament and a brief irenic description of Islam. He claims that the 38 books of the Hebrew Bible are accepted as truth by not just Jews and Christians, but Muslims, Albigensians and Mongols.The first historical section is followed by a long exposition of the visions of Daniel. Moses' interpretation of the four beasts follows Jerome's Commentary on Daniel. Interpreting the prophecy of seventy weeks, he predicts the dawn of the Messianic age in 1290, coming to fruition in 1335. The year 1290 is also found in the prediction of his contemporary, Abraham Abulafia, although there is no evidence that he knew of it.The final two thirds of the text covers the reign of Alexander the Great and his successors down to Herod. Moses occasionally suppresses information in his source that he regards as legendary, such as Alexander's being the son of Pharaoh Nectanebo II. The Chroniques ends abruptly with the story of King Archelaus of Cappadocia reconciling Herod to his son Alexander.\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nMoses identifies his sources as the Bible, the writings of Josephus (which he calls \"la verite de Josephe\", 'the truth of Josephus') and the legends of Alexander the Great. Although Moses' material goes back to Josephus' Jewish Antiquities and Jewish Wars, they were not his direct source. He relied upon the Hebrew Sefer Yosippon, which was regarded as an authentic work of Josephus in his time. It was in fact produced in the tenth century from Latin translations of Josephus' Greek writings, including that known as Pseudo-Hegesippus.The first section dealing with the generations of Noah and history down to the time of the Persian empire is derived from the Sefer Yosippon, as is the long final section covering the period from Alexander to Herod. The middle sections are derived from the Bible and perhaps from \"prophetic compendia or commentaries\". The material translated and heavily abridged from the Sefer Yosippon represents \"the sole pre-modern version ... in a European vernacular.\"\n\n\n=== Manuscript ===\nThe Chroniques is preserved in a single deluxe illuminated manuscript of the late thirteenth century, now in The Hague, Royal Library of the Netherlands, 131 A 3. It was produced in northeastern France or in Flanders. It contains 123 folios. The scribe appears to have worked quickly, resulting in a text riddled with errors. He may have been copying from the \"unrevised\" or \"unfinished\" autograph.The script style is littera textualis. The text is written in the Latin alphabet, whereas most Jewish texts in French were written in the Hebrew alphabet. Only two other medieval French texts of Jewish origin are known that were written in the Latin alphabet: Hagin le Juif's translation of Abraham ibn Ezra for Henry Bate of Mechelen (1273) and a translation of the Hebrew Alexander legend Sefer Alexandros Mokdon (fourteenth century).The text is divided into paragraphs marked by decorated initials. The section on Daniel's visions contains high quality illustrations designed for the text. The text occasionally refers to the illustrations, which follow it faithfully even where it diverges from the Vulgate Bible. Some illustrations have French captions, some Latin.The illustrator may have been the Meliacin Master, who was active between about 1280 and 1310. This puts the copying of the text in or shortly before the period 1290–1335, identified in the text as the start of the Messianic age. The patron or commissioner of the manuscript is unknown, but may have been related to the patron of the text. Margaret Alison Stones suggests one of William X's nephews, Archbishop Guy of Vienne or Bishop-elect William of Liège, or else his younger son, Bishop Guy of Tournai, brother of the ruling counts William XI and Robert VI.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==",

        "content": "Lucky Saint is a brand of low-alcohol pale lager, launched in the United Kingdom in 2018 and produced in Germany by Not Another Beer Co Ltd.\n\n\n== History ==\nLucky Saint was developed by Luke Boase in collaboration with an established brewery in the German state of Bavaria, after two years of collaborating with several breweries across Europe to develop a new low-alcohol beer. Unlike previous attempts, this beer was left unfiltered. Lucky Saint is brewed in Germany for the UK market, because UK law requires that if it were produced domestically it would have to contain no more than 0.05% alcohol in order to be labelled \"alcohol-free\", however this does not apply to products produced in the EU where the limit is only 0.5%.\nThe Lucky Saint brand was officially launched in the UK in October 2018. In January 2020, Lucky Saint launched on draught, and by January 2024 was available on tap in over 1,000 pubs across the UK. In December 2023 a \"Hazy IPA\" variety was introduced, also at 0.5%.\nLucky Saint is currently brewed in Germany for UK-based Not Another Beer Co Ltd, a private limited company incorporated in August 2017.\n\n\n=== Name ===\nThe name \"Lucky Saint\" is an acknowledgement of the luck required to get the idea for the brand off the ground, and the saintly virtuousness of abstaining from alcohol. The brand's logo is a golden ladybird, a traditional symbol of good luck.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Transitional Presidential Council (TPC) (French: Conseil présidentiel de transition) is a collegial head of state constituted on 12 April 2024 to exercise the powers and duties of President of Haiti until new elections for that office can be held and a winner inaugurated, or until 7 February 2026, whichever occurs first.  \nUnder the terms of the enabling decree, the council is to have nine members, two of whom will be non-voting. As of 13 April 2024, it had yet to be established through appointment of its members and is not operative.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe gradual disintegration of Haitian state institutions during the Haitian crisis led to calls for Prime Minister Ariel Henry to step aside and surrender the de facto head of state functions.  On 11 March 2024 Henry announced that he would resign and that a transitional council (whose membership would be determined in Jamaica at an emergency CARICOM meeting) would select an interim prime minister.\nOn 3 April 2024, the transitional presidential council set up at the Caricom meeting on 11 March had finalized its provisional list of representatives, who were appointed by the Council of Ministers on 16 April.\n\nAdded to these seven members are two observers (Frinel Joseph and Régine Abraham).\n\nAfter weeks of negotiation, a deal was sent to CARICOM on 7 April for a temporary government whose mandate will end on 7 February 2026. One of the council's tasks is to elect a prime minister, who cannot already be a member of the transitional council or the provisional government. The transitional council was officially created by a governmental decree published in Le Moniteur on 12 April 2024. The names of the representatives of the seven parties were published on 16 April 2024.\n\n\n=== Reactions and reception ===\n\n\n==== Domestic reaction ====\nThe drafters of the agreement rejected the governmental decree on 13 April and called upon the members of the resigning government to publish the original agreement without modification.\nReactions within Haiti to the announcement of the TPC were mixed, with some Haitians questioning its constitutional legitimacy.\n\nShortly after the council's announcement, Jacky Lumarque, rector of Université Quisqueya, described the council as not being a \"Haitian-led\" solution, calling it a \"snake of seven heads\". He called for a judge of the Court of Cassation to be empowered as unitary acting president, instead.\nJean Saint-Vil, a Haitian activist resident in Canada, decried the proposed council as a body imposed on Haiti by foreign powers and said \"Haiti is a nation held hostage\". Saint-Vil specifically expressed opposition to a requirement added in the decree that council members must accept a multinational security force in Haiti as a condition of appointment.\nCamille LeBlanc, former Haitian minister of justice, said he welcomed the creation of the council but doubted the ability of such a body to resolve Haiti's political impasse.\nJimmy \"Barbecue\" Chérizier, a former police officer who allegedly heads an extralegal armed group in Haiti, said his forces would attack any person who accepted appointment to the council. Chérizier also invoked a traditional Haitian battle cry to describe the fate that would befall councilors: \"Cut off their heads and burn down their houses\". Barbecue earlier objected to the lack of input his federation, the Revolutionary Forces of the G9 Family and Allies, had had in governance transition talks. He also entered into an alliance with another federation of gangs, G-Pèp, to organize plans for armed resistance to any entry of foreign peacekeepers into the country as part of a future transitional arrangement.\n\n\n==== Foreign reaction ====\n\nIn an official statement, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said he \"welcomed\" the creation of the Transitional Presidential Council and urged \"all Haitian stakeholders to continue making progress in putting in place transitional governance arrangements\". \nThe Caribbean Community welcomed the creation of the TPC saying it was a \"Haitian owned formula for governance that will take the troubled country through elections to the restoration of the lapsed state institutions and constitutional government\".\nMatthew Miller, spokesman for the United States Department of State, issued a written statement that said the United States commended \"Haitian leaders for making tough compromises to move toward democratic governance via free and fair elections\" and that the U.S. \"welcomes\" the creation of the TPC.\nIn an 13 April post to social media platform X, President of Kenya William Ruto welcomed the creation of the TPC, saying that \"Kenya expresses confidence that the new political leadership will lay a strong foundation for resolution of the crisis in Haiti, restoration of security, afford the Haitian people a political transition and usher in sustainable peace and development\".\nIn a press release issued 14 April, Louise Mushikiwabo of l'Organisation internationale de la Francophonie \"commended\" the creation of the Transitional Presidential Council.\nOn 15 April, the European Union, through the European External Action Service, said it was \"crucial that the TPC is formally appointed without further delay by the outgoing government of Prime Minister Ariel Henry\".\n\n\n== Authority and mandate ==\nUnder the terms of the decree of 12 April, the Transitional Presidential Council will exercise functions of the office of president until such time as a new president is elected and inaugurated. Its mandate to act concludes on 7 February 2026. The TPC's authority extends to the appointment of a prime minister and government and Henry has agreed to resign from the office of prime minister at such time as the TPC designates someone else to hold the office.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nUnder the terms of the decree of 12 April 2024, the Transitional Presidential Council consists of seven voting and two non-voting members. The voting members include one representative from each of four political party coalitions (Accord du 30 aout 2021, Accord du 21 décembre 2022, Collectif des Partis politiques, and Compromis Historique/RED/EDE), two political parties (Fanmi Lavalas and Platfòm Pitit Desalin), and \"the private sector\". The non-voting members include one representative from civil society and one representative from \"the interfaith community\". On 16 April, the Primature confirmed the appointment of the nine members nominated by the Transitional Presidential Council in Kingston.\n\n\n=== Qualifications ===\nMembers of the TPC must meet the requirements for holding the office of president as established under Article 135 of the Constitution of Haiti and are disqualified from standing for the presidency in the next election. Differences introduced in the decree include that individuals are ineligible for appointment to the Council if they have been sanctioned by the United Nations, if they are under criminal indictment or have been found guilty of a crime in any jurisdiction, or if they oppose the introduction of the Multinational Security Support Mission in Haiti.  Similarly, the government added in article 5 that all members must pursue the accelerated deployment of the international security force.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Council of Government (Uruguay) – former collegial executive of Uruguay\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\"Décret pourtant création du conseil présidentiel de transition\" (PDF).

Although according to Law 31520 of 2022, the dependency is annulled because the institution was refounded as an autonomous entity with a legal nature of internal public law.\n\n\n== History ==\nCreated in 2014 with the promulgation of University Law No. 30220 (Article 12). Replaces the National Assembly of Rectors (ANR). Prior to its creation, it was called the National Superintendency of the Peruvian University (Spanish: Superintendencia Nacional de la Universidad Peruana), established in Chapter III of the aforementioned law.\nSUNEDU became (as of January 5, 2015) responsible for licensing to offer the university higher educational service. In addition, SUNEDU assumes the function of managing the National Registry of Degrees and Titles.\n\n\n== List of superintendants ==\nLorena Masías Quiroga (2015–2017)\nFlor Luna Victoria Mori (2018)\nMartín Benavides Abanto (2018–2020)\nOswaldo Zegarra Rojas (2020–2023)\nManuel Castillo Venegas (2023–present)\n\n\n== See also ==\nHigher education in Peru\n\n\n== References ==",

A severed human leg was found in a nearby park later that day, and subsequently determined by preliminary DNA testing to belong to Robinson. Other body parts were found in different locations later, and the search for remains continues. \nA suspect was charged on April 12 with first-degree intentional homicide, mutilating a corpse, and arson. Before Robinson's death, she and the suspect were seen going on a date at a seafood restaurant where he used to work. The suspect has a lengthy criminal record which includes domestic abuse, drunk driving, and disorderly conduct. When police searched the suspect's home, they reportedly found blood on the walls and a sex dungeon in the basement.\nOn April 18, a passerby walking along a Lake Michigan beach found a torso and arm which are believed to be Robinson's.\n\n\n== Responses ==\nThe assistant district attorney described the killing and dismemberment of Robinson as \"the highest level of violence imaginable\".\nSeveral dozen members of the community held a \"pink-out\" event on the front lawn of the suspect, converting it into a makeshift memorial to Robinson with balloons, posters, flowers, and stuffed animals.\nThe father of the suspect also expressed condolences and sympathy for the Robinson family.\n\n\n== References ==",

He was first given a contract up until the winter break. After playing the 2021 season with Faroese club NSÍ Runavík, Trenskow moved back to Denmark proper and joined second-tier club HB Køge. It took a while before he established himself as a starting player. In the 2022-23 Danish 1st Division, however, Trenskow started 29 of the 30 games he played, scoring 7 goals.\nIn the summer of 2023, he rejected a contract offer from Køge, and joined Kalmar FF in the middle of the 2023 Allsvenskan season. Trenskow was praised for his 2024 pre-season, which included three goals in the 2023-24 Svenska Cupen. He scored his first Kalmar goal on 8 April 2024 against Sirius.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sandra Benčić (born 28 January 1978) is a Croatian politician and civil rights and gender equality activist who is serving as a Member of Parliament since 2020. She is a member of the green-left political platform We Can! since its foundation and has been serving as one of its two coordinators since 2023, together with Tomislav Tomašević.\n\n\n== Career ==\nShe graduated from the Zagreb Faculty of Law in 2014.She is a member of the Centre for Peace Studies (CMS), where she worked until 2018, mostly on the topics of inequality and migration. She also has experience dealing with regional development and EU funds, as a consultant and a co-founder of one of the first consulting companies for EU funds in Croatia – \"Razbor\", where she worked until 2010.Benčić is one of the founders of the human rights \"Solidarna\" foundation. She was a member of the Commission for Handling Complaints in the Ministry of Interior and the Council for the Development of Civil Society.She was elected to Sabor as one of the leading candidates of the Green–Left Coalition in the 2020 Croatian parliamentary election. A representative of the I Electoral district, she is serving as Chairwoman of Parliament's  Environment and Nature Conservation Committee.Ahead of the 2024 Croatian parliamentary election, on September 16, 2023, she was chosen uniformly by the members of party council of the political party We can! as a candidate for the position of the Croatian Prime Minister. In her first public address, Benčić placed emphasis on social and economic equality of all Croatian citizens, the safety and certainty of the work of public institutions as well as equality of all citizens under the law. Furthermore, she placed emphasis on green transition, stating that Croatia needs to be \"..one of the most successful countries in green transition which does not create losers of transitions, but instead creates a more just society...\".   \nIn February of 2024, after the controversial appointment of the judge Ivan Turudić to the position of State Attorney of Croatia by a Prime Minister Andrej Plenković, Sandra Benčić, together with other parliamentarians belonging to left wing We can! party, protested in front of Croatian Sabor the whole day and night before the official voting in the parliament where Turudić was voted in by a majority held by Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ). Following the vote, Benčić announced organization of large protest against the appointment \"on next Saturday\" alongside 11 political parties from the left wing and center of political spectrum. The protest managed to gather more than 5,000 people in the heart of Zagreb Upper Town. During the protest, Sandra Benčić spoke about Croatian emigration problem and called out corruption scandals by the governing party HDZ, and expressed her wishes that \"Croatia becomes a country from which people do not leave so that they can live, but instead a country where people come to lead good lives.\" In 2024 Croatian parliamentary election, Sandra Benčić is the first candidate for the We can! political party in the first electoral district. After the surprise announcement that the current President of Croatia, Zoran Milanović will be a Prime Minister candidate for the Rivers of Justice coalition, Benčić announced that the course of plans for the election campaign for We Can! will remain unchanged and that they will still seek an arrangement with Social Democratic Party of Croatia (SDP) for a coalition in the electoral districts where the right-wing political parties are typically stronger. She also criticized the move and expressed that, if she were in Milanović place, she would have abdicated from the position of President before joining the campaign. However, the two parties were unable to reach an agreement for a \"spotted coalition\" and have decided to have separate candidacy lists in the electoral districts that are more right leaning. Despite that, both Sandra Benčić and Arsen Bauk from SDP have expressed hope that this strategy would lead to more electoral seats as well as wish for future cooperation to remove the HDZ from the goverment. During Benčić visit in earthquake stricken Petrinja, her speech was interrupted by a local heckler who accused her of incompetence because \"she cannot lead a trade and she studied for 18 years\". Benčić dismissed these charges as a typical attack from the supporters of Croatian Democratic Union and Andrej Plenković, who use these arguments instead, because of \"a lack of any political sustenance\".\n\n\n== Private life ==\nShe is married to Miroslav Petrović. The couple has two sons.Her role models in politics are Ivica Račan and Sanna Marin.Benčić revealed that she regularly attends Let 3, TBF and Hladno pivo concerts.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSandra Benčić at 10th Croatian Parliament\nBiography at mozemo.hr",

        "content": "Old Wolverton Road Bridge (bridge number 171D) caries the West Coast Main Line over Old Wolverton Road just north of Wolverton Works in Buckinghamshire, southern England. It was designed by Robert Stephenson for the London and Birmingham Railway and opened with the line in 1838. It is a Grade II listed building.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe bridge has a single arch over the road. It was originally built in English bond-style red brick with dressings in red sandstone, though repairs have been undertaken in blue engineering brick. The arch rests on substantial imposts. The bridge is heavily skewed—the railway continues in a straight line while the road passes underneath—giving it elongated wing walls, particularly on its west side. These curve away from the bridge and terminate in stone piers with pyramidical caps. On the east side, the northern retaining wall abuts the railway embankment which was the site of the original Wolverton railway station, since demolished and now occupied by the Royal Train Shed.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe bridge was built from 1837 to 1838 and opened with the London and Birmingham Railway's (L&BR) line in 1838. It was designed by the railway's chief engineer, Robert Stephenson. It was widened in the 1880s by the L&BR's successor, the London and North Western Railway, when the line was quadruple-tracked. The extension was built in blue engineering brick, which was also used for repairs to the original structure to the point that it now overwhelms the red brick and little of the 1830s brickwork is visible.The bridge was designated a Grade II listed building in 2001 in recognition of its historical and architectural significance. Listed building status provides legal protection from demolition or unsympathetic alteration. Wolverton was home to L&BR's engineering works and multiple structures associated with the L&BR survive, including the original bridge over the canal (which now only serves the works), the Blue Bridge, and Wolverton Viaduct to the north.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Reginald Thomas Heygate (7 January 1858 - 1 March 1947) was an association footballer and Church of England vicar, who played in the 1880 FA Cup final.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHe was the fifth son of William and Maria Elizabeth Heygate; William was the assistant curate of Leigh-on-Sea.He was educated at Lancing College, one of the first schools to teach association football, and was captain of the school side against former pupils in 1876.  He went up to Keble College, Oxford in 1877, and graduated in 1881.\n\n\n== Football career ==\nHe quickly made the Oxford University first XI, making his debut in the 1877–78 FA Cup first round win over Herts Rangers at the Parks.  His first goal for the university came in a defeat to the Wanderers at the Kennington Oval in a friendly in December that year, and his first in competitive football came at the same venue in the third round win over Clapham Rovers.  He was however injured for the semi-final against the Royal Engineers, which went to two replays before the Sappers won through.\nHe did not represent the university at all in 1878–79, although he did represent his college side, and was considered a substitute when included in the XI for the first round replay against Great Marlow in the 1879–80 FA Cup, which Oxford won 1–0.  However he kept his place, scoring in the second round against the Birmingham Club, and creating the winning goal against Maidenhead in the third round thanks to his throw-in causing defensive chaos, a tie for which he was captain.  He retained the captaincy for the remainder of the competition, including the final, in which Clapham Rovers got revenge for its defeat in 1877–78, beating Oxford with a late winner.He captained the Oxford side in the Varsity match against Cambridge University in 1880 and 1881, but was on the losing side both times.  He also came close to representing England, being one of the reserves for the 1881 international match against Scotland.However, his final association match was for the university against the Old Westminsters in March 1881, as he did not keep his association football career going after graduation.  Instead he turned to the rugby union code, playing as a forward for Leeds Parish Church from 1882 to 1884, and even played in a trial match to select players for the Yorkshire representative side in October 1883.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHe became the curate of Leeds in 1882, and after holding ecclesiastical positions (including a spell in St John's, Newfoundland), was made vicar of Honley, near Huddersfield, in 1893.  He was twice offered colonial bishopris (in Colombo and Bermuda).In the 20th century, he moved to Lincolnshire, holding a vicarage in Boston from 1905 to 1916, before becoming Rector of Tetbury from 1916 to 1923, when he retired to Staunton in Herefordshire.  He was also made a canon of Lincoln Cathedral in 1909.He married Mary Archibald, the daughter of Sir Adams Archibald, the governor of Nova Scotia, on 29 July 1890 in Carshalton.  The couple did not have children.  Heygate died on 1 March 1947, survived by Mary, leaving her an estate of £4,184.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Gracixalus yunnanensis, the Yunnan bush frog, is a species of frog in the family Rhacophoridae. It is native to Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and China's Yunnan Province.\nThe adult male frog measures 26.0–34.2 mm in snout-vent length. The skin of the dorsum is yellow-brown or red-brown in color. The iris is bronze in color.  The male frog has a vocal sac and conical tubercles on its back.\nThis frog has been observed on vegetation in evergreen forests, where it has been observed between 1678 and 2166 meters above sea level.  Scientists believe this frog lays eggs in pools, like its congeners.\nScientists classify this frog as being at least concern of extinction because of its large range. This range includes at least one protected park: Pu Mat National Park in Vietnam.\n\n\n== References ==",

Named after the olive trees located there since their introduction in 1560, it is part of the cultural heritage of Peru.\n\n\n== History ==\nOriginally part of the Guática territory, under the Spanish authorities it became part of the El Rosario hacienda, belonging to the Dominican Order until 1539. Martín de Porres was one of the people who planted olive trees in the area during the 17th century. Once property of the Count of San Isidro, it was declared a National Monument in 1959 and a Monumental Zone in 1998.\nThe park is the location of the House of Culture (and former Municipal Palaca), the El Olivar Cultural Centre, which houses the Municipal Library, the Chamber Theater, the Children's Library, the Multipurpose Room and the Art Gallery; and the Marina Núñez del Prado Museum. There are also many buildings designed by architects such as Ricardo de Jaxa Malachowski, Emilio Harth-Terré and José Álvarez Calderón.\nThe neighbourhood, which consists of the park's surroundings, houses a number of historical buildings, among them the embassies of Colombia (residence), Finland, France, and Morocco.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nSan Isidro District, Lima\n\n\n== References ==",

It was inaugurated on July 4, 2021.\n\n\n== Design ==\nAbout the outlook of the tower Gehry wrote: \"We wanted to evoke the local, from Vincent van Gogh's painting Starry Night to the soaring rock clusters you find in the Camargue region. Its central drum echoes the circular plan of the Roman amphitheatre\".\nThe building is 56 meters tall and has 12 floors (10 stories). It sits on a rotunda, \"the Drum\" of 54 metres in diameter and height 16 to 18 meters. The interior surface area is 15,000 sq.m., of which 2,000 sq.m. is dedicated for exhibitions and 1,4000 sq.m. for other purposes. It is covered with 11,000 angled reflective stainless steel panels.\nThe building includes exhibition spaces, workshops, a library, an auditorium with 150 seats, and a café.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first project for LUMA Arles was presented by Maja Hoffmann and Frank Gehry in July 2008 to the city of Arles. It was rejected for being too tall. Only the third attempt was accepted in December 2012. Construction started in 2014.\n\n\n== References ==",

Furthermore, a sector of the Justicialist Party led by Juan Luis Manzur decided not to join the new bloc, among them is Manzur himself, the national senator Sandra Mendoza, the deputies Pablo Yedlin and Carlos Aníbal Cisneros.\n\n\n== References ==",

Leguía, as part of an urban program to modernize the city. President Leguía attended its inauguration on July 27, 1922.\nIt has three bronze plaques made by the Peruvian sculptor Luis Felipe Agurto that represent the stages of the Battle of San Juan and Chorrillos which disappeared in 2007 as a result of vandalism and abandonment until 2018, when they were replaced thanks to a donation from the Peruvian Astronomy Association, whose headquarters are located in the Morro Solar Planetarium, a few meters from the monument.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMorro Solar\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Wiebe Boer is a businessman and philanthropist who served as the 12th president of Calvin University in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n\n\n== Career ==\nOn 28 March 2022, Calvin University announced that it had appointed Boer as the 12th president of the university. On 26 October 2022, Boer was officially inaugurated as president, after beginning his tenure in July of the same year.\n\n\n=== Resignation from Calvin University ===\nOn 26 February 2024, Calvin University's board of trustees announced that Boer had resigned as president after they received a report alleging that Boer had engaged in inappropriate communications with a non-student, non-faculty member of the community. Boer has denied any allegations of misconduct, with his resignation only occurring after the board already decided that he could no longer serve as president of the university.\n\n\n=== Lawsuit against Calvin University ===\nOn 12 April 2024, Boer and his wife Joanna filed a lawsuit against Calvin University alleging breach of contract, discrimination, and defamation. The lawsuit alleges that Boer was first made aware that a complaint of inappropriate communications had been issued against him after being called to a meeting with the board of trustees on 22 February 2024. During this meeting, Boer claims he acknowledged having communications with the complainant, but denies that the communication was inappropriate. Boer also claims the board told him to limit communication to only family and a trusted advisor or he would face termination.\nOn 24 February 2024, the lawsuit states Boer was given a 15-minute meeting with the board to defend himself. After the meeting, the board told him they had the votes to fire him and was given a 7 pm deadline to decide if he would resign. This deadline was later moved up to 5 pm by the board's chair. At 4:55 pm, Boer agreed to resign as president. Following his resignation, the board released a statement that the lawsuit alleges to contain several statements that defame Boer with mentions of the Title IX due process, despite the process never being afforded to him.\nFollowing his resignation, Boer claims he was told they had until 15 April to move out of their home, the DeWit Manor. Boer attempted to negotiate an extension to this, however, no deal was made between him and the university. On 2 April 2024, the suit claims that Calvin officials entered the home and changed all the locks to prevent the Boer family from reentry. On 7 April, the Boer family returned from a family vacation where they claimed they were greeted by Calvin security personnel who would only allow one family member to enter the house at a time accompanied by a member of security to collect their belongings.\nFollowing the issuing of the lawsuit, Calvin University's board of trustees issued a statement denying any wrongdoing and claimed the lawsuit contained several misrepresentations of the events.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Rick and Morty Go to Hell is a limited series graphic novel written by Ryan Ferrier, illustrated by Constanza Orozo, and colored by Sarah Stern, which was published in five parts in 2020 by Oni Press as an epilogue to The Rickoning, the twelfth and final volume of the first ongoing comic series based on the franchise by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon. Tonally described as \"Dante's Inferno meets Office Space\", Part One was released on April 29; Part Two was released on May 27; Part Three was released on June 24; Part Four was released on September 23; and Part Five was released on October 21 (all in 2020).\nReceiving a positive critical reception, the series was republished in April 2023 as the first volume of Rick and Morty Deluxe Double Features, an omnibus with Rick and Morty Ever After. The series' demonic visions of Rick and Morty were later made available as playable characters in the free-to-play role-playing video game Pocket Mortys.\n\n\n== Premise ==\nBased on the same multiple timeline concept as described in the Rick and Morty first season episode \"Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind\", Rick and Morty Go to Hell follows the alternate universe Smith family from The Rickoning as they descend into Hell after the destruction of their parallel universe at the hands of the Rickluminati's universe-destroying bomb, with no memory of their deaths. As the family separately explore the realm, Summer attempts to find true love, Jerry unwittingly inspires a revolution, and Rick remains in denial as Morty attempts to reach and make a deal with the Devil, Lucifer Morningstar / Lucius Needful (from \"Something Ricked This Way Comes\"), to return to life.\n\n\n== Development ==\nAfter Oni Press' original contract to publish an ongoing comic book series based on the animated series Rick and Morty expired after five years with the conclusion of The Rickoning in March 2020, initially announced as the conclusion of the series and brand as a whole, Oni Press signed a new contract for a succession of limited-run series from different writer/illustrator teams, beginning with Rick and Morty Go to Hell, an epilogue series to The Rickoning following its alternate reality Rick, Morty, and Smith family as they find themselves in Hell following their deaths (and the destruction of their universe) at the end of The Rickoning.\nAnnounced in January 2020, to be written by Ryan Ferrier and illustrated by Constanza Oroza, with a premise of \"Dante's Inferno meets Office Space\", Ferrier described the series as \"some of the best comedy I've [ever] written. And I’ve always had a propensity for writing comedy, and especially satire. I think it's really fun [to bring] a ridiculous amount of laughs [to] the realm of fire and brimstone\", further elaborating on \"wreak[ing] havoc in the Rick and Morty sandbox [as] a total thrill\", describing his collaboration with Oroza as forming a \"phenomenal, equally twisted team [to make] weird, irreverent, and most importantly, funny comics,\" finally summarising the affair as \"Mad science fiction and devil business are two of my favorite things, and we're taking extreme joy in throwing these characters into the figurative and literal fires. Rick and Morty are going to Hell, and we're taking you down with us!\".\nTo promote the series, two different covers drawn by Brian Smith were made available, along with an \"insane\" variant cover limited to 1,000 copies by Zé Burnay made available through Oni's website in the \"Exclusive Editions\" section of their store.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n== Collected editions ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRick and Morty Go to Hell at Oni Press",

        "content": "Mission Lindsay was a World War II Office of Strategic Services (OSS) military expedition to Yugoslav Partisans in Slovenia, sent in May 1944. The group was led by Major Franklin Lindsay and included Lieutenant Gordon Bush, Lieutenant Schraeder - the weather officer, and Corporal James Fisher - the radio operator.  It was a part of the wider, Maclean Mission, which arrived in September 1943.  The mission left Brindisi airfield in a RAF Halifax bomber and together with cargo of guns, explosives, radios and medical supplies parachuted in Dolenjska, near the village of Semič on 14 May 1944.  The fifth member, Corporal Edward Welles, was left behind in Italy in order to assemble the additional equipment that the group would ask for, once they had arrived to Slovenia.  Eventually, he joined them in mid-August.\nThe primary purpose of the mission was to disrupt railway transport between Northern Italy, Austria (still part of the Third Reich), Hungary and the Balkans.  Reducing the movement of troops, weapons, fuel and raw materials (such as oil, bauxite, copper, zinc, lead and chrome) would damage German military ambitions and its war industry.  They were to execute this via sabotage and demolition - blowing-up railroads, bridges and viaducts throughout their assigned area.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAs the Allies continued their advancement in southern Italy, it became an imperative to reduce German reinforcements and resupplies coming from Eastern and South-Eastern Europe.  The Slovenian Alps were an ideal natural barrier to these movements, with Ljubljana Gap making a narrow strait.  At the heart of it was Zidani Most, a railway junction where three key branches of the railroad met, linking Germany with Port of Trieste and the Italian front as well as Hungary, Romania, Serbia and Greece.  Any disruption here was bound to harm the Third Reich's military might.\n\n\"Our immediate mission was to cut the rail lines that run through the Southeastern Alps, in order to block the transfer of German reinforcements from Austria, Hungary and the Balkans to the Italian front, as the Allied armies approached Rome and pushed further north.  With their advance, the blocking of those same lines would later become a key to helping bottle up German divisions in the Balkans.\nSchraeder was sent to set up a weather observation station near the local airfield used by Luftwaffe.  This was to provide the Allied air forces with a better picture of the weather over German-occupied Europe in order to assign next targets to their bombers.  It would also enable Allied meteorologists to compare the observations with the encrypted German ones taken at the same time and location, thus help break the German military weather codes.\n\n\"This would make it possible to read all of the German weather reports from occupied Europe as soon as they were sent, a feat I later heard was ultimately accomplished.\n\n\n== Arrival ==\nThe quartet landed safely, together with their equipment and were picked up by the local Partisans, who escorted them to their headquarters.  There they met Captain James Goodwin, an American head of the Allied Liaison Mission, and Lieutenant George Wuchinich, a Serbian-American OSS officer.  They agreed with the local commanders that they would progress further north into Styria, which was officially still part of the Third Reich and get closer to the key railroads.  They were accompanied by a young Partisan lieutenant, Vlado Valenčak, as an interpreter and link with the locals, and a British Lieutenant Dan Gatoni, who was searching for a Major McNeff of MI-6 who had gone to the region previously but was not heard from.   \nThey passed the village of Maravce, and after a short rest reached a farm near Gornji Grad on 6 June.  There they met local commander, Viktor Avbelj \"Rudi\" and secured a parachute drop location before moving to Pohorje, into safer, higher and less populated mountainous area.  Here they found Major McNeff, as well as Vuchko Vuchkovic who was sent by the Special Operations Executive (SOE) during the previous winter and had not been heard from since.  In the meantime, Lieutenant Bush went on a separate expedition further south to try and damage the mainline railway link between Zagreb and Ljubljana.   \n\n\n== Blowing up the railroads and first reviews ==\nUpon reaching the regional HQ, the team joined local Partisan commanders in poring over the maps and choosing the most suitable targets for their operation.  They chose the key dual-track line that linked Austria with Italy, as well as its single-track western branch.  If they were successful that would leave only one, single-track connection to Treviso, the line that was already full to capacity.  The targets were: a 350-foot stone viaduct near Mislinje, a 700-foot tunnel at Lipoglav and two bridges, one at Zbelovo, the other at Tremerje.  They also received a \"four bombers\" worth of drop of explosives and tools. \nPartisans wanted their own demolitions unit, consisting of former miners experienced in handling explosives, to lay down the charges.  Mislinje viaduct was patrolled by the German troops, who had 1,700 men in the 6 miles radius - most of whom could reach it within 30 minutes.  This night they were surprised not to have encountered guards on the viaduct.  They dug up holes next to the three of the seven massive stone columns that held it up.  They buried 650kg explosives into them, and used further 200kg at the arched top of the nearby tunnel, wired it up and detonated it.\nAs soon as the explosion was heard, the Partisans opened fire onto the nearby garrison to prevent the Germans from counter-attack.  Once the dust had settled, they noticed that the three columns were damaged but remained standing.  Still under German cross-fire, they were able to reload the remaining 250kg of explosives and detonate it an hour later.  This finally toppled them and the railway was no longer usable or easily repairable.\nThe other three targets were even more challenging.  They were heavily guarded, and required the removal of the German troops prior to the intervention.  The bridge at Zbelovo remained standing as the 150kg charge did not explode but merely burned out.  The one at Tremerje was also standing as the brigade was \"too weak and poorly armed to overcome the garrison\".  Finally, with the tunnel at Lipoglav, the Partisans were more successful and were able to execute two smaller explosions, one at each end and put it out of use for a few weeks.\nIt soon became obvious that the actions were not as effective as they should have been and that a huge risk and loses in being in position to lay down the explosives, were not followed by a good demolition work.  In its report, the local Partisans reported\n\n\"The entire operation was well conceived, yet badly executed.  The preparations themselves were poor.  The demolition job was completely overlooked.  No calculations were made as to the amount of explosives needed for the demolition of specific objectives...  It also became clear that the miners are still incapable of executing such works, that they are not trained sufficiently for it, and that demolition of such targets is still beyond their powers.\"\nDespite this, the Partisans were able to completely block the railroad for five weeks at the height of the summer 1944 war.  Meanwhile, Lieutenant Bush returned and confirmed that his group had managed to block the southern mainline for a week by \"filling deep cuts with rock blown down by explosive charges from either side\".\n\n\n== First liberated area ==\nThe following weeks were spent on the move, actively escaping German expeditions and encirclements, which made it difficult to organise further air-drops.  Eventually they ended up in Upper Savinja Valley and by 3 July managed to get a drop from a single aircraft at Mozirska.  Corporal Welles finally arrived in mid-August, together with a British SOE officer - Major Roberts who was a part of Lieutenant Colonel Peter Wilkinson's group intended for infiltration into Austria.\nIn time, Lindsay got an opportunity to understand the Partisan movement and meet some of its key political and military leaders, including Mile Kilibarda, Jože Borštnar, Alojz Kolman Marok, Dragomir Benčič Brkin and Franc Primožič. They were mainly part of the 14th Division, which was now strengthening the Partisan presence in Styria.  Once, he asked Aleš Bebler, a prominent local leader, how they gained the confidence and support of the local population.  His response was that it took at least six months to \"prepare the people politically before any armed units could be sent\".\n\n\"Preparing the people politically meant sending in clandestine workers who would recruit civilians into the Liberation Front, hold small secret meetings, recruit informers in the local police and military units, and gradually build a supportive underground structure.  It also meant creating a secret counterintelligence organization to uncover and eliminate enemy penetrations into the Partisans' own organization.\"\nEncouraged by their successes, the division commanders decided to attack German garrisons in Luče, Ljubno and Gornji Grad on 30 July.  In order to prevent German reinforcements, they blockaded and mined roads, bridges and the local railroad, and launched a diversionary attack on the Litija garrison, some twenty miles south.  The attacks were successful and had created the very first liberated territory inside the Third Reich itself.  On 13 August, they attacked and destroyed the German garrison at Rimske Toplice and cut-off an important railroad.\nOn 19 August, the mission received instructions from Brigadier Fitzroy Maclean, which was in fact Marshall Tito's order to be forwarded to the local Partisan commanders, concerning Operation Ratweek – a co-ordinated all-out attack on the rail and road communications across the Balkan.  The order was sent via SOE channels in order to prevent it from being intercepted by the Germans.  The objective was to ensure that the 24 remaining German divisions south of Slovenia are unable to withdraw towards Germany and aid the resistance to Soviet and Anglo-American troops attacking from the East, South and West of the Third Reich.\nThe mission agreed the key local targets with the Partisans for the operation scheduled to start on 1 September.  These included a bridge and rock cuts on the main Vienna line, and five kilometres of track they would remove and destroy. They were still very short of explosives, with Lindsay constantly reminding the supplier - \"Unless you get explosives to Fourteenth Div their action will be minor.  They plan to attack again tunnel and bridge but can't do it with bare hands\".  In the end, the explosive had been delayed and the operation was limited - some tracks were cut, retaining walls destroyed and three smaller bridges were blown.  After the June's intervention - tunnels and bridges were much better guarded.  Finally, Lindsay arranged for the Allied air-attacks to destroy key bridges at Maribor and Zidani Most.\nOn 11 and 12 September, the Partisans launched a successful attack on Mozirje and two other nearby garrisons expanding the liberated the whole valley.  In late October, large German troops entered the valley, and torched the houses and stole the livestock.  Upon their retreat, those that Partisans were able to capture were sent to their barracks stripped of their clothing and boots.\n\n\n== Attempt to expand into Austria ==\nBeing well inside the Reich's territory the mission was an excellent launch pad for penetrating into Austria and Hungary.  It was with this in mind that Lt Col Peter Wilkinson and Major Alfgar Hesketh-Prichard procured Tito's approval for the new destination.  In May 1944, Lt Col Charles Villiers was dropped to the area and together with others, worked with the local Koroska Odred to make contact with the Austrians.  Additionally, Captain Charles Fisher arrived with twelve men in September the same year in order to strengthen the link, together with the senior local Partisan commander Franc Leskošek Luka. After many attempts, no Allies-friendly group in Austria could be identified or contacted and the attempt failed.\n\n\n== Strained relationship ==\nAs the 1944 was nearing the end and both Anglo-American and Soviet troops were making great progress towards Berlin, it became likely that the Partisans would want to expand their territory not only to the pre-1941 border, but also incorporating nearby areas of Austria and Italy with significant Slovene and Croatian population.  This was in direct conflict with the allied plans for the two countries.  While the mission was mainly interested in reporting on German large troop and materiel movements able to impact situation on the Western or Italian fronts, the Partisans were living day-by-day focusing on the small incursion and local German troops that were causing them the most danger. Additionally, the Partisans were aware of the American military missions to their royalist Chetnik troops and were concerned about the information going back to their enemies via this route.\nFinally, a mixture of ideological differences, wartime distrust, fear of espionage, poor weather and difficult communication and logistic channels led to disagreements and misunderstandings.  This was explained in one of the Force 399 memos:\n\n\"The following are the principal snags which have hindered us supporting Frank [Lindsay]:\n(a) Weather - Stajerska [Styria] is a notoriously bad weather area;\n\n(b) Range - 60 Group has been unable to reach Stajerska from Brindisi and 267 Squadron is normally committed elsewhere.  The squadron has no bomb racks [to carry rifles and machine gun containers] and they cannot be fitted without withdrawing aircraft from service for 120 hours.\"\n\n\n== The German defector ==\nOn 24 October Lindsay received the instruction to prepare to a high-secrecy mission to Zagreb and arrange the surrender of the German Lt General Edmund Glaise von Horstenau, their military plenipotentiary there.  The mission had been agreed with Lt Col Howard Chapin and Col Ellery Huntington and approved by Tito.  His current tasks would be handed over to a British officer, Captain Douglas Owen.  On 6 December, in the mist of a German offensive, Lindsay, Ed Welles and Jim Fisher started their perilous overland journey to Zagreb.  After a few days of snow covered paths they crossed the river Sava and reached Trebnje, after which they continued onto Slovenian HQ at Semič.  \nTheir they met other Maclean Mission representatives - Captain Jim Goodwin and Lt Col Peter Moore who debriefed on the state of play in the local area.  They also pointed out that the Partisans' approach towards them was deteriorating.  Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, had been liberated two months prior with the aid of the Soviet Red Army, and the communist leaders of the movement became more vocal in their support.\nOn 18 December, they continued their journey crossing into Croatia and eventually reaching the town of Glina, where they were picked up by an American representative who drove them to the Croatian HQ at Topusko to join OSS Lt Col Lanning \"Packy\" McFarland whose jeep was delivered via a C-47 landing few days before.  They also met the local Partisan commanders, Ivan Gošnjak and Vladimir Bakarić, who had informed him that General Glaise had been arrested by the Gestapo two weeks earlier and is no longer contactable.    \nLyndsey spent the following couple of months with the British Mission at Topusko, headed by Major Randolph Churchill:  \n\n\"The Partisans were flattered to have the prime minister's son with them but they were put off when he told them what he thought of them, which was seldom flattering.  He was one of the most aggressively rude men I ever met.  He once told me that whenever anyone was rude to him he was immediately three times as rude in return.  He was sure to win out.  No one could possibly best him.\"    \nOn 19 February 1945, Lyndsey was flown out to the Allied HQ at Caserta, Italy and told that his new post would be to replace Lieutenant Colonel Charles Thayer as head of the American military mission in the recently liberated Belgrade.  \n\n\n== Belgrade Mission ==\nLindsay arrived to war-torn Belgrade and met his mission commander, Brigadier MacLean, for the first time, noticing that the British officers had \"many close school and family ties\".  He also realised that the alliance with the Partisan hosts had further deteriorated and became formal, and there were \"no longer close and friendly relations that had existed in the early days in the forest\".\nOn one occasion, he participated in a luncheon given by the US General Ira Eaker, where he met the head of the Soviet military mission Major General A F Kiselev, Tito's chief of staff, Arso Jovanović as well as Tito himself.  General Eaker also brought Thornton Wilder, as a cultural adviser for the Partisan's production of Wilder's play \"Our Town\".\nBy now the local US military mission provided much of political, economic and order of battle reporting.  It consisted of Navy Lieutenant Robert Miner, Captain Eugene O'Meara, academics and local language experts Michael Petrovich and Alex Vucinich, as well as Sergeant Yeiser and Captain William Cary.  From there, they observed and reported on the establishment of the new Yugoslavia and its interim government. \n\n\n== Trieste crisis ==\nAs the end of the war was in sight, the Partisans made it clear that they considered large part of the former Austro-Hungarian province of Venezia Giulia populated with significant Slovene and Croatian population an inalienable part of the future Yugoslavia.  Additionally, some saw their claim to the territory as the winning side of the Second World War, analogous to its annexation by the Italians after the First World War.  The area, in their view, covered Istrian peninsula, and the cities of Rijeka, Pula, Gorizia, Trieste and Monfalcone.\nIn late February 1945 Field Marshall Harold Alexander visited Tito in Belgrade and agreed the future demarcation line between the two armies and understanding that the Port of Trieste, and all the northbound rail and road communications would be under his control and disposal.  This was crucial to the Allied advancement into Austria and Germany.\nNevertheless, Yugoslav Fourth Army entered the territory and established itself on the left bank of the river Soča all the way down to its estuary, taking over all the key cities.  In order to avoid significant conflict, Alexander sent his chief of staff Lieutenant General William Morgan and Brigadier General A L Hamblen to Belgrade to ask the demarcation follow the rail/road line between Trieste and Austria with the Yugoslavs withdrawing their troops two to ten miles to the east of it.  Their newly formed civilian authorities to the west would remain in administrative power.  The talks were also attended by Air Vice Marshall A S G Lee, who had replaced Fitzroy Maclean as head of the British military mission.  Lindsey drafted the common agreed conclusions signed by both sides.  The agreement established the Morgan Line.\nThe situation was complex, as Yugoslavs demanded the full political and military control of the Venezia Giulia province, including Trieste. Their arguments were numerous.  In their view, they had liberated the territory from the Germans, suffered tremendous losses at the hands of the Italian and German occupation forces, there was a significant Slovene and Croat population in the area and Italy had only held it by the right of conquest at the end of the First World War.  On the international level, they had compared it to the Allies' rights to occupy or annex parts of Germany.  They had also believed that Stalin and the Soviet Union would support them, which turned out not to be the case.  Stalin had bigger issues on the demarcation line between the US and Soviet forces inside Germany as well as his assistance to the Italian Communist Party, which had a wide support and could possibly win the elections.  Eventually, the territory was split between the two countries, with Italy retaining Trieste with its surroundings and Yugoslavia incorporating the remaining area.\nIn June 1945, the US Military Mission in Belgrade closed and Lindsey was appointed political adviser to General John Harding, the military governor of the Trieste territory, at the castle of Duino. He continued there until moving to Paris to work for Averell Harriman, the European head of the Marshall Plan.\n\n\n== Epilogue ==\nEver since leaving Styria on 6 December 1944, Lindsay was anxious to find out what happened to those he left behind.  Eventually he was able to meet up with Robert Plan, one of the survivors and locate Captain Owen's radio messages.\nGerman attack on the Partisan units was carried out by the notorious 13th SS Mountain Division on 4 December in an attempt to reclaim the area which they had lost in August.  Three days later they had taken Mozirje, and Rečica landing strip the following day.  The Partisans had dispersed into the higher levels of the mountains with only one remote drop area at Mala still under their control.  On 15 December Owen signalled that they were on emergency schedule at Menina Mountains.  By then, the whole Savinja valley was recaptured by the Germans who pretended to offer an amnesty to those who surrender.  Those who did were locked up in Luce and summarily executed shortly afterwards. \nMajor Matthews, Lieutenant Edward Parks, Captain Charles Fisher and his radio operator Robert Plan, Owen and his radio operator Campbell were still there.  Germans had used 15,000 battle-hardened troops, while Partisan numbers fell under 2,000 fighters.  The situation was getting desperate with mixture of constant movement, deep snow and bad weather conditions which meant that the first aid with radios, batteries, clothing and food was dropped on 20 February 1945 - more than two months after the offensive had started.  During that time, Matthews, Parks, Fisher, Hesketh-Prichard, Rosenfeld and Knoth were all killed, the latter two as wounded in Partisan hidden hospital in Mozirske Planine - a unit of the 14th SS Division discovered it and set it alight with the wounded still inside. Eventually, Partisans were able to regain the initiative and return.  \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nDjilas, Milovan (1980). Wartime.

        "content": "José Castro Mendivil Digital Planetarium (Spanish: Planetario Digital José Castro Mendivil), also known simply as the Morro Solar Planetarium (Spanish: Planetario del Morro Solar), is a planetarium and site museum dedicated to astronomy in the Morro Solar of Chorrillos District, Lima, Peru. It is named after the engineer who designed it.\nIt is administered by the Peruvian Astronomy Association (Spanish: Asociación Peruana de Astronomía, APA), founded on August 15, 1946, and then headed by Peruvian astronomer Víctor Estremadoyro Robles. Besides its 360° theatre, it also features remnants of the Battle of San Juan during the War of the Pacific.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first stone was placed at 1 p.m. by Peruvian astronomer and head of the Peruvian Astronomy Association, Víctor Estremadoyro Robles, during a ceremony that took place on February 19, 1954, three years after the Peruvian government granted the terrain for the building's construction. It was formally inaugurated on April 23, 1960.\nIn 1968, construction of an observatory began, with the Astronomical League of the United States donating a Schmidt–Cassegrain telescope. The building's iron dome was designed by the industrial service of the Peruvian Navy, with the entire complex having a cost of US$ 62,800.\nIn 2013, a digital projector was added to the planetarium.\nIn 2018, the APA donated three bronze plaques to replace the ones stolen at the nearby Monument to the Unknown Soldier.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMorro Solar\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Revolução sem sangue (lit. Revolution without blood) is a 2024 Portuguese film directed by Rui Pedro Sousa. The film, the director's debut feature, was released on April 11, 2024, in Portugal so as to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Carnation Revolution, which it depicts. Despite that revolution being largely considered a \"bloodless\" one, the film focuses on five persons whom were killed during the events. That is why the title, after being shown as Revolução sem sangue in the opening credits is stylised Revolução sem sangue (Revolution without blood) in the end credits (which is rendered as Revolução (sem) sangue in certain media).\nThe film is based on real events that took place on April 24–26, 1974, in Lisbon.\n\n\n== Premise ==\nJoão Arruda is an Azorean student at the University of Lisbon and is interested in Marxism and political philosophy. Fernando Giesteira works as a bartender, in the hope of studying later. Fernando Reis is a soldier, coming home to Lisbon for a few days.The path of the three young men, hoping for more freedom in the country, leads them in front of the seat of the PIDE, in Lisbon, on April 25, 1974. There, António Lage works as a civil servant, but his scruples become unbearable when he witnesses a young woman (Inês) being tortured, and he decides to quit his position. As the radio reports that a growing gathering of the population supported by the army is happening in the city, the director of the PIDE decides to have compromising documents burnt and let Inês be released in the morning. But in the evening she comes back among the crowd, accompanied by her young daughter, to join the demonstrations and shout her anger before the seat of the PIDE. She, João Arruda and Fernando Giesteira are shot by the PIDE from the windows of the building, while Fernando Reis is accidentally shot by another soldier while trying to catch Lage, who had surrendered but is also shot as he is running away.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nLucas Dutra as Fernando Giesteira\nRafael Paes as João Arruda\nDiogo Fernandes as Fernando Reis\nManuel Nabais as António Lage\nTeresa Vieira as Inês\nHelena Caldeira as Rita, Fernando Giesteira's girlfriend\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was shot on location in Lisbon. It was produced with the help of familiars of the victims.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nPúblico found the film sincere but as surprising in its good as in its bad aspects. Another review praised the intentions of the film.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRevolução sem sangue at IMDb",

        "content": "Dawn D. Bennett-Alexander (born 1951) is a lawyer, academic, author and consultant who created the first course in employment law addressing workplace discrimination for colleges of business and led in the development of what is now known as Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DEIB).\nWorking in the employment law field for more than 40 years, she is an expert in legal studies, inclusion, diversity, and sexual harassment. She published works about gender, race, sexual orientation, and particularly within the context of employment law.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBorn January 2, 1951 in Washington, D.C., Dawn D. Bennett is the daughter of Ann Pearl Frances Liles Bennett and William H. Bennett, who served in the military during World War II. After the war and university, William was a clerk at the National Bureau of Standards and Harry Diamond Laboratories. Beginning in 1955, and for 22 years,  her father was a pastor at Galilee Baptist Church in Washington D.C. Bennett-Alexander had four siblings, Jean, Gale, Brenda, and William, who is a pastor. Bennett-Alexander's mother, Ann, died in 1971. When William married Pearl Thompson, Bennett-Alexander acquired two stepsisters Roberta and Rosalyn and a step brother, Donnell Thompson.\nWhen she was age two, her family moved into an all-white neighborhood in Washington, D.C., feeling that her family were at least as good as their neighbors.  Bennett-Alexander adapted well, with discernment about who she wanted as friends, who could be trusted, and who moved out of the neighborhood.\n\nBennett-Alexander was 12 when she attended the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and heard Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech (August 28, 1963). She said \"he took not only the country to a new place as regards to race, but he totally changed the expectations that we have now come to take for granted as to how people should be treated.\"\nBennett-Alexander attended Defiance College from 1968 to 1970 and she earned her B.A. from Federal City College (now the University of the District of Columbia) in 1972. She earned her J.D. from the Howard University School of Law in 1975.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Lawyer, consultant, and educator ===\nBennett-Alexander was a law clerk to Honorable Julia Cooper Mack at the District of Columbia Court of Appeals from 1975 to 1976. Mack was the first African American female appointed under the District of Columbia's new Home Rule Act of 1973 to the highest court in D.C., the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. The Honorable Julia Cooper Mack was the first African American female appointed to a court of last resort in the United States.\nFrom there, Bennett-Alexander was assistant to associate director and counsel at the White House Domestic Policy Council until 1977. She was then a law clerk at the Federal Trade Commission from 1977 to 1978. Bennett-Alexander began her teaching career at the Antioch School of Law (now the University of the District of Columbia David A. Clarke School of Law) from 1979 to 1980. After that, she was an advisor and attorney at the Federal Labor Relations Authority from 1981 to 1982, when she was hired at the University of North Florida as an associate professor of business and employment law. In 1984, she received a fellowship from the McKnight Foundation, Florida Endowment Fund, and McKnight Jr. Faculty Award.\nBennett-Alexander taught Employment Law at colleges of business based on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. At the University of Georgia's Terry College of Business since 1988, she was the school's first African American female professor and she has been the only tenure-track African American female professor. Even though there have been improvements since the civil rights era, there has not been a lot of integration of social events. Bennett-Alexander has encouraged her students to go to events that might make them uncomfortable, like a white student going to \"step shows\" at black fraternities and sororities. The dance grew out of the slave era.\nBennett-Alexander was awarded the Fulbright Scholar fellowship and researched and taught at the Ghana School of Law from October 2000 - August 2001. Her project was \"Race and Gender as Factors in Employment in a 'Homogeneous' Society\". \nShe presented \"Practical diversity: taking inclusion from theory to practice\" in a TEDx talk panel discussion on March 27, 2015. Bennett-Alexander consulted with organizations and companies about equity and inclusion after the racially motivated killings of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and George Floyd. The purpose of her work with them was to identify ways in which they may have fallen short in the past and what they can do now to be more equitable and inclusive. Stunned by emotional toll that the deaths have had on blacks, and Americans as a whole, Bennett-Alexander prepared a Osher Lifelong Learning Institute (OLLI) course at the University of Georgia entitled Diversity and Inclusion in a Post-COVID World: Does it Still Matter. She entered the field of teaching to help people and of her intentions to be kind, nonjudgmental, and live according to principles and beliefs formed over one's life. She learned these principles since she was a child. When young, she felt ashamed after she played a prank on a fellow schoolmate and instantly regretted it. It was a teaching moment for her. Bennett-Alexander has applied these principles to the work that she does with her consulting firm Practical Diversity. In the OLLI course, she seeks to build a common understanding about racial relations with assigned reading and open-minded discussions, and to understand the tolls that systemic policies and laws play in perpetuating dissension. \nBennett-Alexander noted that the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal brought unprecedented levels of detail to the discussion of sexual scandals and harassment, so that some people feel freer to share their own experiences.\nBennett-Alexander retired from University of Georgia in 2020. Bennett-Alexander taught the Anti-Racist Courtroom course at the National Judicial College and became a member of its faculty.\n\n\n=== Writer ===\nBennett-Alexander met Laura Hartman at an Academy of Legal Studies in Business conference in the 1990s and they since then they co-authored college text books, beginning with Employment Law for Business, the first Employment Law textbook for colleges of business. Linda P. Hartman, has been the associate vice-president for academic affairs at DePaul University. Other important publications are: \"Sexual Harassment in the Office\", in Personnel Administrator in 1988; \"The State of Affirmative Action in Employment: A Post Stotts Retrospective\" in the American Business Law Journal in 1990, \"Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment: A Clearer View\" in the Labor Law Journal in 1991; and The Legal, Ethical & Regulatory Environment of Business, published in 1996. \nBennett-Alexander, author of \"Reflections on being an out African American lesbian on a Southern campus\" in Lesbians in academia (1997), has published about affinity orientation, including her experiences as an out faculty member, stating that \"I think it benefits me and my colleagues and the students\". In 2011, Bennett-Alexander co-authored the The Legal, Ethical and Regulatory Environment of Business in a Diverse Society. Bennett-Alexander wrote My Hair Is Not Like Yours: Workplace Hair Grooming Policies for African American Women as Racial Stereotyping in Violation of Title VII in 2016 with Linda F. Harrison.\n\nLike their mother, Bennett-Alexander's three daughters contributed to the book Children of the Dream : our own stories of growing up Black in America. They are Jennifer Dawn Bennett-Alexander, Anne Alexis Bennett-Alexander, and Tess Alexander Bennett-Harrison. Related to this, Bennett-Alexander, who is driven by the men and women who walked and struggled before her, researched her family's history to share the stories with her daughters. She learned that her enslaved great-grandmother bore a lifetime scar she received when fighting off being raped by the landowner. Bennett-Alexander states that her ancestors created the opportunities that led to her success today. She has been inspired by the photograph of The Boss, taken by Prentice (P. H.) Polk. Dressed in slave clothing, the woman in the photograph \"has more dignity and more common sense than many people whose wealth or academic degrees indicate in their stature\".\n\n\n=== Foster tolerance and acceptance ===\nTo teach her students the \"reality besides their own\", Bennett-Alexander has studied the Holocaust and the ways in which Americans have treated African Americans during the years of slavery and Native Americans during their forced displacement, such as the Trail of Tears.\nIn 2016, Bennett-Alexander and Cas Mudde, both professors at the University of Georgia spoke at the viewing of Hate: A Film by Israeli Nadav Eyal at the school. About Islamophobia, particularly in northern Europe, the hatred against Muslims is also intertwined with anti-Semitism. Mudde has an interest in extremism and Bennett-Alexander teaches her students how to \"operationalize diversity.\"\n\n\n=== Membership ===\nBennett-Alexander was the president of the Southeastern Academy of Legal Studies in Business from 1992 to 1993. She was a co-chair of the Employment Law Section of the organization from 1992 to 1994. Bennett-Alexander has been a member of National Council of Negro Women and National Organization for Women since the 1980s, and also joined legal, political action committee, and theater organizations. She served as a board member for the Girls Clubs of Jacksonville, Inc., Consumer Credit Counseling Services of Northeast Florida, and the Friends of Athens Creative Theater.\n\n\n=== Awards and scholarship ===\nShe received the National Elizabeth Hurlock Beckman Excellence in Teaching Award and President's Martin Luther King Jr. Fulfilling the Dream Award at the University of Georgia. She has received other awards for research and teaching excellence and multi-party dispute resolution. \nAn annual award was created in her name, the Dawn D. Bennett-Alexander Inclusive Community Award, for faculty members at the University of Georgia. She founded the Dawn D. Bennett-Alexander Building Bridges Scholarship for qualified students who pursue diversity and inclusiveness in their studies. She started the scholarship fund with a $25,000 award that she received with the National Elizabeth Hurlock Beckman Excellence in Teaching Award.\n\n\n== Publications ==\n\n\n=== Legal books ===\nEmployment Law for Business (10th ed.).

        "content": "Jiuhou Nü (Chinese: 九侯女; pinyin: Jiǔhóu Nǚ; lit. 'Daughter of Jiuhou'; c. ? — ?) was a consort of King Zhou of Shang during the Shang dynasty. She was of the Mi surname and came from the ruling family of Guifang, a region located in present-day northwestern Shaanxi, and western Inner Mongolia. Her father, Jiuhou, was a vassal ruler of the Shang dynasty and also the chief of Guifang.\n\n\n== Historical accounts ==\nAccording to the Shiji (史記; Records of the Grand Historian), Jiuhou Nü was offered to King Zhou as part of a marriage alliance between the Guifang and the Shang Dynasty. However, she was not favored by King Zhou and was subsequently executed on the false charge of 'not liking lust.' Her father, Jiuhou, was also executed by being chopped into pieces. The deaths of Jiuhou Nü and her father were major turning points in the history of the Shang dynasty. It is often cited as an example of King Zhou's cruelty and tyranny, leading to the alienation of the Guifang, who had been one of the Shang's most important allies. Additionally, it contributed to the growing resentment of King Zhou's rule, which eventually led to his overthrow.There are different opinions on the cause of the death of Jiuhou Nü. The mainstream views are based on two accounts: one from the Records of the Grand Historian which states \"Jiuhou Nü was not lewd\", and the other from the Lüshi Chunqiu (呂氏春秋, The Annals of Lü Buwei) which records \"King Zhou listened to the slander of Daji and executed Jiuhou Nü and her father\".According to Correction of Qianfu's Commentary (夫論箋校正), Marquess Jiuhou presented his daughter to King Zhou of Shang. The king was overjoyed and believed her to be the most beautiful woman in the world. He asked Daji for her opinion. Daji, fearing that the king would favor the new concubine and neglect her, feigned tears and exclaimed, \"Your Majesty, are you losing your eyesight with age? How could you call such an ugly woman beautiful?\" The king agreed with Daji's assessment that the Marquess's daughter was unattractive. Daji was also afraid that other marquesses and dukes would send their beautiful daughters to the king, so she told him, \"Marquess Jiuhou is unrighteous. He wants to use his daughter to bewitch you. If you don't punish him, how can you deter others?\". King Zhou was furious and had the Marquess's daughter boiled to death and fed to her father. Following this incident, all the beautiful women in the world remained secluded in their chambers during the day, fearing the king's attention.Queen Jiang, a character and fictional queen consort of King Zhou from Fengshen Yanyi, a 16th-century Chinese novel, was based on the life of Jiuhou Nü.The tomb of Jiuhou Nü is located in present-day Qixian County, Hebi City, Henan Province, along the banks of the Qi River.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Manchester, Robertson & Allison (colloquially often abbreviated as MRA's) was a large department store in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada. Founded in 1866 by James Manchester, James F. Robertson and Joseph Allison, the store, which contained several departments, was in business until closing in 1973 and being replaced by the Brunswick Square.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1866, Manchester Roberson Allison Ltd. was founded in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, being named after the surnames of the three founders: James Manchester, James F. Robertson and Joseph Allison. Their first store, located on Prince William Street, was opened on April 3, 1866, initially selling general merchandise and dry goods. They additionally hired a clerk and two boys. As the business grew, they would move into a larger place in Market Square the following year. They would start becoming known as MRA's, and expanded the business on to King Street by 1873, selling dry goods, clothing and a variety of furniture in different departments. According to New Brunswick history author David Goss, MRA's was the location of \"Santa's first store appearance in Canada\" in 1887, and \"his arrival caused such an uproar the police had to be called to disperse the crowd.\" Manchester, Robertson & Allison would use buildings they purchased on Prince William Street in 1916 as warehouse facilities. Founding member Robertson would serve as president until his death in 1921. The business would also advertise the Port of Saint John in newspapers, where they self-proclaimed themselves as \"The Maritimes' Largest Dry Goods House\". They would also transition from being private to becoming a corporation in 1928, as well as quit wholesaling.\nIn 1941, the business would incorporate M.R.A. Holdings Ltd., serving as a holding company for Manchester Robertson Allison Ltd.'s capital stock. By 1948, the store in Saint John featured 45 departments as well as 135,000 square feet (12,500 m2) of floor space on King and Germain Streets. Around the following year, the store was acquired by English chain owner Harry Brooks who implemented a credit policy resulting in controversy among competitor businesses. M.R.A. Holdings Ltd., which additionally own a couple of furniture companies by this point, was purchased by the Saint-John based Eastern Securities Company in 1958. Four years later, the holding company amalgamated New Way Furniture Company into Manchester Robertson Allison Limited. Among Manchester Robertson Allison Ltd.'s serving directors included Philip Oland, who also served as CEO of Moosehead Breweries.\nIn 1973, after 107 years of business, Manchester, Robertson & Allison closed. Later claimed by The Bangor Daily News as being the last independent department store in the country, The location of the business was set to be demolished in preparation for a $42 million urban renewal development, replacing the store with the Brunswick Square building complex, featuring retail space, an office tower as well as a hotel. M.R.A. Holdings Ltd. was among the sponsors for this project. At the time of its closure, the business employed 200 people full-time, as well as an additional 300 part-time.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Cine Gibi is a Brazilian franchise of animated films and magazines based on the Monica and friends comics by Mauricio de Sousa. The films revolve around a Franklin machine that reproduces comic books in movie format. The first, Cine Gibi, was released in 2004 after the appreciation of cinema in Brazil and was the only one in the series to be released in cinemas. In all, there are nine films in the franchise, and some films have spawned magazines with stories based on them. In general, Cine Gibi had a mixed reception.\n\n\n== General information ==\nThe films in the Cine Gibi series center on a giant blender-shaped machine created by the character Franklin. This machine projects comic book stories in movie format, in a cinema session where the main characters, such as Monica,Maggy, Smudge and Jimmy Five, are present. The stories are adapted from the Monica and Friends comics.\n\n\n=== Cast ===\nThe main voice actors in the Cine Gibi franchise are listed below.\n\nMarli Bortoletto – Monica\nAngélica Santos – Jimmy Five\nPaulo Cavalcante – Smudge\nElza Gonçalves – Maggy\nSibele Toledo – Franklin\nDirceu de Oliveira – Chuck Billy\n\n\n== History ==\n The first Cine Gibi was made possible by the \"valorization of national production\"; Mauricio hadn't created any films for years. With a budget of 5 million reais and made \"in a hurry\" to coincide with the school vacation period, it was released in theaters on July 9, 2004. In October, it was released on DVD, the first with a sign language option. The sequel, Cine Gibi 2, was distinguished by the presence of the character Chuck Billy, who did not appear in the first film. Unlike the first, it was not released in cinemas, but directly on physical media on September 7, 2005. Forty thousand DVD units went on sale, promoted by Blockbuster and Nissin, and the film was also released on VHS. The stories from the movie were republished in Cine Gibi 2 - The Magazine (PT: A Revista), released in the same month by Editora Globo.On December 5, 2008, the sequel to Cine Gibi 2 was released on DVD, Cine Gibi 3 - Foolproof plan (PT: Planos Infalíveis), focusing on stories about Jimmy Five. From October 2, 2009, Cine Gibi 4 - Boys and Girls (PT: Meninos e Meninas) began to be distributed on DVD. It was also reported that the first three DVDs in the series were available for purchase in a collector's case. In March of the following year, a magazine of the same name was launched based on the stories in the movie. Six months later, on the 28th, the sequel Cine Gibi 5 - Lights, Camera, Action! (PT: Luz, Camera, Ação!) was released and, in February 2011, it spawned a magazine of the same name. Cine Gibi 6 - Bath time (PT: Hora do Banho), focusing on the character Smudge, was released in 2013. The following year, Cine Gibi 7 - Animal Mess (PT: Bagunça Animal)  was launched. In 2015, Cine Gibi 8 - Are you kidding? (PT: Tá Brincando?) was released. The last film in the series so far is Cine Gibi 9 - Let's Pretend! (PT: Vamos Fazer de Conta!) , released in 2016.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe first Cine Gibi, the only one to be released in theaters, attracted 31,658 spectators on the weekend of July 9-11, 2004. According to the Blockbuster Network, its DVD was the third best-seller for the week of January 3-10, 2005. Film critics analyzed only the first two films in the franchise, and generally had a mixed reception. For example, while CineClick called the stories in the first film \"entertaining\", Cineplayers said they were \"no fun at all\" and gave it a score of 3/10. Omelete and CineClick praised the technical quality, but UOL Cinema said it was \"technically inferior to the cartoons of the 80s\". There were two reviews of the second film: one from Folha de S.Paulo, with a rating of one star out of three, commenting that it wasn't as good as the first, and another from UOL Cinema, which gave it a rating of two stars out of five and said that the animation was \"cleaner, but also more simplistic\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nMonica and Friends\nMonica and Friends (TV Series)\nThe New Adventures of Monica and Friends\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Touchardia sandwicensis is a species of flowering plant in the nettle family, Urticaceae. It is a tree native to the Hawaiian Islands, where it is commonly known as ōpuhe, hōpue, or hona.\nIt is a medium-sized evergreen tree growing to 35 ft (10.7 m) tall on the island of Hawaii, and a shrub or small tree on the other islands. It has a straight trunk up to 1 foot in diameter, and grey, smooth, fibrous bark. Leaves are large, alternate, and oblong or narrowly elliptical, 15–36 centimetres (5.9–14.2 in) long by 4–12 centimetres (1.6–4.7 in) wide, on a leaf stalk 3–5 centimetres (1.2–2.0 in) long. They are pointed at the apex and blunt at the base, with wavy teeth along the margins. Plants are dioecious, and flowers grow in clusters (cymes) of numerous tiny flowers along twigs and at the base of leaves. Fruits are rounded and about 3 millimetres (0.12 in) in diameter, containing a single seed.\nIt is widespread in moist forests throughout the islands, growing from 150–1,680 metres (490–5,510 ft) elevation on Hawaii.\nThe species was first described as Urera sandwicensis by Hugh Algernon Weddell in 1854. It is known by several synonyms, including Urera glabra. A phylogenetic analysis published in 2021 revealed that U. sandwicensis is more closely related to Touchardia latifolia, another Hawaiian endemic, than to the other species in genus Urera, and the species was placed in genus Touchardia as T. sandwicensis.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Marlon Brando: Hollywood Rebel, written by Burt Kearns and published on 2 April 2024 by Applause Theatre & Cinema Books, is a nonfiction book that reveals the continuing cultural influence of the actor and activist Marlon Brando.\n\n\n== Details ==\nThe book, released the day before Marlon Brando's centenary (and twenty years after his death), shows “how the greatest actor of the twentieth century helped lead the world into the twenty-first,” and continues to have an influence on popular culture that goes beyond acting to include activism, environmentalism, the civil rights movement, music, fashion, art, rock 'n' roll culture, youth culture, gay culture, \"biker flicks,\" sexuality, and psychotherapy, as well as on cultural figures including Paul Newman, James Dean, Johnny Depp, Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Kenneth Anger, Tom of Finland, Andy Warhol, Robert Mapplethorpe, and the Ramones.Donald Liebenson wrote in The Saturday Evening Post that \"Kearns is usually drawn to cultural figures who fly under the radar (his last book was Lawrence Tierney: Hollywood’s Real Life Tough Guy). That’s not Brando, about whom much has been written. But Kearns is also drawn to cultural outliers, and Brando profoundly changed the art of acting (even if he was dismissive in interviews about his own profession). The challenge, Kearns told The Saturday Evening Post, was to find a fresh angle on this much chronicled artist enshrined in myth and legend. Marlon Brando: Hollywood Rebel is not another biography, but more an examination of Brando’s enduring influence 100 years after his birth and 20 years after his death.”Writing in the Los Angeles Times, Chris Vognar called the book “a worthy addition to the Brando bookshelf, largely because the author picks an idea and never loses sight of it, even as he fans across multiple disciplines to explore the idea. This is a book about how one facet of one man captured in one image from one film can send ripples through the world.” Library Journal called the book “an entertaining and enlightening study of Brando’s impressive influence.”\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Roland Crappé's raids on Portuguese colonies (Danish; Roland Crappés plyndringer på portugisiske kolonier: Portuguese; Os ataques de Roland Crappé às colónias portuguesas) refers to a series of raids by Dutchman in Danish service, Roland Crappé, on Portuguese Ceylon and India. The raids were partially unsuccessful, in that Crappé's ship, Øresund (meaning the Sound), catched fire and sank.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1611, after the Portuguese captured Kandy and set fire to the city, King Senerat of Kandy urgently dispatched courier, Marchells Michielsz Boschouver, to Europe in hopes of negotiating an alliance-treaty with the Dutch East India Company. Despite his efforts, the mission was unsuccessful and Boschouver ended up in Denmark, where he signed an un-ratified treaty with Christian IV of Denmark. Denmark then sent five vessels and 300 soldiers, led by Ove Gjedde, to Ceylon to fulfill the terms of the treaty. Along with Gjedde, Dutchman and experienced seafarer, Roland Crappé was sent too. Because of his earlier experiences, Crappé was sent to India two months before Gjedde.\n\n\n== Battle and raids ==\n\nCrappé arrived on board of Øresund, as the first representative of the Danish expedition, on Ceylon in January 1619. Crappé's task was to prepare for Ove Giedde's arrival. Crappé met with the raja, Senarat of Kandy, and mentioned Boshouwer's mission, which the raja seems to have knowledge about. Senarat encouraged Crappé to attack the Portuguese, which was an encouragement that demanded careful consideration; to conduct privateering against a European Great Power was a dubious affair, which could end in destruction.\nThough, Crappé wanted to make a good impression on the raja, and attacked the Portuguese on the Coromandel Coast. He hijacked five Portuguese sampans and attacked Jaffna, Nagapattinam and other coastal Portuguese outposts. Despite Portuguese irritation, they didn't want to politicize the situation. Instead they retaliated by attacking Øresund of Karaikal.\nNear the fishing village of Karaikal, seven smaller Portuguese vessels tried to recapture the five sampans. Under fire, Øresund catched fire and sank. Crappé recalls the event:\n\n...I found myself surrounded by some drawn sabers, and they dragged me by the throat through a quarter where I thought they were going to murder us...\n27 of the ship's crew, including Crappé, were imprisoned. Crappé was brought over to the lifeguard's house to sleep. Next morning he witnessed 4 of his comrades heads on spikes.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nRoland Crappé, to his luck, got in contact with a senior official of the local Thanjavur kingdom. And after a month 14 healthy or wounded Dano-Norwegians were rescued out of Portuguese imprisonment. Together with Crappé, the 15 men went out to the city of Thanjavur, and through friends, Crappé managed to get into audience with the king, Raghunatha. Raghunatha got five additional Dano-Norwegians out of Nagapattinam, and fined Portugal for the loss of Øresund.\nRaghunatha could see the idea in forging ties with another European power in the hope of decreasing the influence of the Portuguese in his kingdom. That is why in 1620, the Danes established themselves at Tranquebar.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCattle War – Conflict between Danish India and the Thanjavur Maratha kingdom\nOve Gjedde – Danish nobleman and Admiral of the Realm\nPortuguese conquest of the Jaffna kingdom – Portuguese conquest of the Jaffna kingdom in Sri Lanka (1560-1621)\nDannemarksnagore – City/town in West Bengal, IndiaPages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback\nConquest of Koneswaram Temple – Colonial controntation between the Portuguese and the Danish\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Vitaly Nikolayevich Goryaev (1 [14] April 1910 – 12 April 1982) was a Soviet and Russian painter, graphic illustrator, caricaturist. He was People's Artist of the USSR (1981) and winner of the USSR State Prize (1967).\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nVitaly Goryaev was born on 1 (14) April 1910 in the family of a bank manager in Kurgan, Tobolsk Governorate (now the administrative centre of the Kurgan Oblast).\nIn 1921, he relocated with his family to Chita, where he began his creative journey. He received guidance from the local artist, Ivan Sverkunov, and accompanied him on study trips. He drew caricatures for the school newspaper in the style of popular magazines such as Smekhach and Prozhektor, and attempted to create illustrations in the style of Vladimir Lebedev. As a schoolboy, he started contributing to Zabaikalsky Rabochiy. Initially, he cut out other people's drawings on linoleum, but later he began creating his own.\nThe artist-to-be had other interests besides drawing. At 17, he experimented with circus and operetta, but ultimately designed sets, posters, and programs for productions. He also wrote poems in the style of V. Mayakovsky, which were eagerly printed by Chita newspapers. He made acquaintances with local poets and was accepted into the Chita Association of Proletarian Writers. However, in his later life, poems played a less significant role than the drawings he used to illustrate his own manuscripts.\nIn 1929, after graduating from high school, he enrolled in the Moscow Higher Technical School with the intention of studying bridge design. It was during this time that he had a fateful encounter with the poet V. Mayakovsky. The artist recounted the details of this meeting in various ways. According to Soviet sources, a student from a technical school approached the Moscow Association of Proletarian Writers to have a collection of Chita poets reviewed. However, he was unable to obtain a response or a manuscript. V. Mayakovsky assisted him in obtaining the manuscripts and agreed to assess his poems. Later, Mayakovsky's attention was drawn to a folder of drawings that the young man was carrying with him. During the modern period, the artist's family claims that he met V. Mayakovsky while playing billiards. They struck up a conversation and the artist challenged the famous poet to a game, which he won. As a result, the artist asked Mayakovsky to evaluate his manuscripts, which included illustrations of his own work in addition to poems. Although Mayakovsky was not interested in the poems, he was impressed by the drawings and convinced the artist to pursue a career in art instead of his technical speciality. V. Mayakovsky himself retrieved his documents from the school and went to the rector of the Higher Art and Technical Institute (VKhUTEIN), Pavel Novitsky, with Goryaev, to persuade Novitsky to hold an exam for the young man, despite the admission tests having already ended. As a result, Goryaev was admitted as a student of the Higher Art and Technical Institute.\nAcquaintance with V. Mayakovsky changed the poet's life and developed into a friendship and creative collaboration. Mayakovsky entrusted him with the design of his exhibitions, including the exhibition 20 Years of Mayakovsky's Work in 1930, shortly before his death. In his book I Saw Them..., cartoonist Joseph Igin cites a story that his friend from the institute, V. Goryaev, told him in 1970s. During his cooperation with V. Mayakovsky, V. Goryaev was experiencing financial difficulties. Upon learning of this, the poet assisted him in securing a job as a costume designer at the Bolshoi Theatre. Due to his good physical condition, V. Goryaev was able to perform on stage as part of the corps de ballet in the production Footballer.\n\n\n=== Studies ===\nIn his second year at VKhUTEIN, he joined the poster and lithographic department led by Dmitry Moor. Later, he enrolled at the Polygraphic Institute (now the Moscow State University of Printing Arts), which was formed by merging Moscow and Leningrad VKhUTEIN. There, he studied under Alexandr Deyneka, Sergey Gerasimov, Pavel Pavlinov, Konstantin Istomin, Lev Bruni, and Vladimir Favorsky.\nFrom 1931, he was a member of the Young October Art Association, and from 1932, he joined the newly formed Union of Artists of the USSR. At the insistence of D. Moore, while still a student, he began to participate in exhibitions and work for newspapers and magazines such as Bezbozhnik, Smena, Pioneer, and Propagandist. In 1934, he graduated from the institute, but, according to his son, was left without a diploma due to his difficult character.\nHis institute acquaintance Sergey Urusevsky recalled how in 1936, together with artist Viktor Vakidin they decided to sketch Vsevolod Meyerhold's productions. To gain access to the theatre, they created a petition on behalf of the institute. They reviewed and observed numerous productions, and this experience had a lasting impact on their future work. Goryaev spoke with Vs. Meyerhold, who suggested that he draw what was happening behind the scenes of the theatre instead of the events on stage. V. Goryaev was fascinated and created many drawings of backstage life, but unfortunately, they were lost in a fire during the war.\n\n\n== Creative work ==\n\n\n=== Magazine graphics ===\nAfter graduating, he was assigned to the publishing house Izobrazitelnoye Iskusstvo, where he worked until the spring of 1935. During this time, he created several posters that were awarded competitive prizes. Following this, he accepted an invitation from the People's Commissariat of the River Fleet to become an artist on the propaganda steamer Propagandist. He travelled along the Volga and Kama rivers until the autumn of 1936, working at the wharves. At each new stop, the artist and the propaganda steamer's management learned about the state of local affairs, identified achievements and problems. The artist then worked on cartoons, slogans, and caustic caricatures. One individual who took issue with his drawing filed a complaint with the editorial office, alleging that he was impersonating a staff member of the magazine Krokodil. The magazine took notice and requested a meeting with the artist to discuss the matter. After clarifying the situation, the editorial board expressed appreciation for the artist's work and commissioned him to create a full-page drawing featuring water transport. Since then, he has frequently collaborated with Krokodil. His colleagues at the publication, including Leonid Soifertis, Yuliy Ganf, and Ivan Semyonov, became his good friends, and Lev Brodaty also became his teacher. He also collaborated with other illustrated publications, such as Smena and Tridtsat Dney. His cooperation with the magazine Yunost was particularly long, where he was a member of the editorial board from 1955 to 1981. The artist's cartoons published in the magazines were also published in independent collections.\n\n\n=== Working as a war correspondent ===\nHis initial war writings date back to the autumn of 1939 when he was sent as a war correspondent to the territories of Western Ukraine and Western Belarus, which were annexed to the USSR as a result of the Polish campaign of the Red Army. He signed most of the sheets as Western Ukraine. During this trip, he created numerous genre drawings and watercolours, which were exhibited in Moscow in 1940. He also visited the annexed Baltic states.\nDuring the early stages of the war between the USSR and Germany, he was employed at Okna TASS. In under six months, he produced 80 posters with the primary objective of exposing the 'new order' imposed by the Nazis in Western Europe. At the end of 1941, he led the Kuibyshev branch of Okna TASS for a period of time. Together with Nikolai Sokolov of the Kukryniksy team, he created several iconic posters, including the well-known caricature poster of Adolf Hitler and his entourage, Crows in Peacock Feathers.\nIn January 1942, the artist was suspended from work on Okna TASS after being denounced by a fellow graphic artist. The following month, he was drafted into the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army by the Soviet district military commissariat of Moscow. He was sent to the Western Front to serve as an art director and executive secretary of the military satirical magazine Frontovoy Yumor. This magazine was published in the format of unfolded sheets under the size of an officer's tablet and contained feuilletons, journalistic notes from the front line, poems and caustic caricatures of the enemy, designed to maintain the army's morale. Poets Alexey Surkov and Mikhail Matusovsky wrote to the magazine. Graphic artists Orest Goncharov, Yevgeny Yevgan, Andrey Goncharov, Boris Yefimov, Ivan Semyonov and Kukryniksy, painters Alexander Bubnov, Pavel Sokolov-Skalya and Pyotr Shukhmin collaborated under the guidance of the artist. Frontovoy Yumor was printed in city printing houses near the front line and in dugouts. After the liberation of Smolensk, the editorial office had a topography train. The magazine was edited by P. Bannik, M. Kogan, T. Mironov, M. Slobodskoy, and L. Shapiro. Between 1941 and 1945, the publication frequency of the magazine varied: 4 issues were published in 1941, 17 in 1942, 12 in 1943, 12 in 1944, and 6 in 1945. Between 1941 and 1945. The editorial office of Krasnoarmeyskaya Pravda, where the artist's drawings were also published, was located near Frontovoy Yumor, and the artist formed a strong friendship with its chief editor, Aleksandr Tvardovsky.\n\nMy father did not like to talk about the war and did not give any details to his family. But once I heard a television interview in which he told a story of how he had gone to the front line with Tvardovsky. How afraid he was, but he tried not to show it, because looking like a coward in Alexander Trifonovich's eyes was even scarier...\nFor each issue of Frontovoy Yumor, he drew one or two cartoons. During the war, he created genre drawings based on real-life experiences and fresh impressions, depicting scenes from the front and the work of the home front. Several caricatures from the series New Order in Western Europe were exhibited at the Great Patriotic War exhibition in Moscow in 1943. The works comprising the On the Roads of War series were created through lithography. In 1944, they were exhibited alongside other war works by graphic artists Lev Brodaty and Aminadav Kanevsky. The artist finished the war in Königsberg with the rank of captain and was awarded the Order of the Red Star, as well as the medals \"For Bravery\", \"For Battle Merit\", \"For the Capture of Koenigsberg\", and \"For the Victory over Germany in the Great Patriotic War 1941–1945.\"\n\n\n=== Creative trips ===\n\nDuring the 1950s, the artist travelled extensively throughout the Soviet Union and abroad during the Khrushchev Thaw. He visited the Kakhovka Dam construction site twice in 1953–1954, where he created a series of genre drawings and watercolours. In 1956, he presented these works, along with post-war illustrations, at a joint exhibition with Konstantin Dorokhov, Sulamifi Zaslavskaya, Sarra Lebedeva, Andrei Goncharov, and Ilya Slonim in Moscow. It was, in fact, six separate expositions under a common roof, which became the artists' first large solo exhibitions.\nIn 1958, he was among the first Soviet intellectuals to visit the United States after the war. He travelled with the artist Ivan Semyonov, invited by the editorial office of Krokodil to attend the congress held in Indianapolis by the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists. Following the event, he missed his flight due to unforeseen circumstances. As flights between the countries were infrequent, the American side offered to extend his visa. In May–June 1958, he visited Indianapolis, New York, Washington, D.C., and Boston, and had the opportunity to meet with President Dwight Eisenhower. During the trip, he earned money through his drawings. He arranged for publications in the New-York Tribune, and during the famous Indianapolis races, he drew illustrations for the hourly rush issues of newspapers. His sketches and observations formed the basis of a series of 40 drawings titled 'Americans at Home', which were exhibited and appreciated in both the USSR and the USA. For instance, the Moskovsky Khudozhnik newspaper for 1959 published a letter by the American artist Rockwell Kent in No. 6-7:\n\nDear Mr Editor!\nThis letter, believe me, is not so much an occasion to thank you for the small, friendly article about me in No. 11 of your magazine for 1958, as it is an opportunity to express my admiration, which I think all Americans should feel when looking at the most beautiful satirical drawings of Vitaly Goryaev. Robert Burns wrote:\nOh who could give us the power / To see ourselves through the eyes of others.\n\nThe magazine \"Culture and Life\", publishing drawings by V. Goryaev, has given us such a power. The Soviet artist's drawings, sharp, full of friendly humour, will help us to see ourselves from the outside and will contribute to the establishment of friendship between our two peoples.\nDuring the summer of 1959, the artist took a creative trip to Palanga in the Lithuanian SSR, where he produced approximately 60 genre drawings and compositions. In the autumn, he travelled to France with a group of journalists and writers, where he had the opportunity to meet with Pablo Picasso, Nadia Léger, and Jean Effel. During this trip, the artist produced over 100 drawings from life, which was a departure from his usual method of collecting impressions and sketches during the day and reproducing them in the evening. In the same year, his French works were presented in a group exhibition. Additionally, personal exhibitions featuring works from various journeys taken between 1958 and 1959 were held in Vilnius and Kaunas in March and April 1960. The artist travelled to Finland, Bulgaria, the GDR, Romania, France, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Ceylon. Each trip resulted in a new series of drawings. Additionally, the artist revisited the US, where acquaintances attempted to arrange a meeting with Ernest Hemingway due to their similar appearance, but it was not realised.\n\n\n=== Illustrations ===\nThe artist began illustrating fiction in the late 1930s, but only revealed himself in this capacity after the war. His early works include illustrations for several stories published in magazines, as well as the books Diary of a Provincial in St Petersburg, The Tashkenters Clique by Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin, and My Street by Sergey Mikhalkov.\nThe artist created illustrations for Mark Twain's The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn twice - first in 1948 and then in 1960 after his trip to the United States. The illustrations created in 1948 were well-received and bought by both the Russian Museum and the State Tretyakov Gallery. Tom Sawyer was reprinted multiple times, while only some of the illustrations for Huckleberry Finn were published. Additionally, he produced illustrations for several other Mark Twain stories, including The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg, Senator Dilworthy, and How I Edited an Agricultural Newspaper.\nAgniya Barto practically granted him a monopoly on illustrating her works. His drawings were published in Swings (1946), The House Has Moved (1947 and 1949), Poems for Children, Petya Draws, The Redskins, and About the Big and the Small (1959). The artist is credited with the first illustrations for Yury Olesha's The Three Fat Men, which became a reference point for the style chosen by the authors of the 1966 film adaptation. His illustrations were used to illustrate several works, including 'About the Tsar and the Shoemaker' and 'A True Story' by Samuil Marshak, 'The White Sail is Lonely' by Valentin Kataev, 'What is Good and What is Bad' by Vladimir Mayakovsky, Little Pete Stories by Leila Berg (1956), and 'Old Man Hottabych' by Lazar Lagin. He illustrated several works including O. Henry's short stories, Theodore Dreiser's An American Tragedy, Hans Scherfig's The Scorpion, and Martti Larni's pamphlet novel The Fourth Vertebra.\nIllustrations for classic Russian literature, including works by Alexander Pushkin, Nikolai Gogol, and Fyodor Dostoevsky, held a special place in the artist's work. The illustrations for Gogol's Petersburg Tales, which the artist worked on from the late 1950s to the mid-1960s, were awarded the USSR State Prize in 1967. In 1971, F. Dostoevsky's The Idiot was published with illustrations by the artist. Four years later, the illustrations earned him a gold medal at the Leipzig Book Fair. However, in the USSR, the illustrations were met with a scathing review in the magazine Communist due to their artistic avant-garde. In 1974, a two-volume book of Pushkin's Poems and Tales with drawings by the artist was published, and in 1979 - Dead Souls by N. Gogol. His last major work in this direction was The Adolescent  by F. Dostoevsky, published after the artist's death.\n\n\n=== Painting ===\nThe artist's interest in painting began in 1929 after he was introduced to the work of Paul Cézanne through a small painting titled Morning on the Marne. He continued to paint for the rest of his life, but did not achieve fame as a painter. His works, which stylistically followed the post-impressionists and avant-gardists of the 1920s and were close to cubism and miriskusniki, were unexpected for their time and did not align with the ideals of socialist realism. The artist received harsh criticism from Vladimir Kemenov, vice-president of the USSR Academy of Arts, for being avant-garde. Despite being a famous artist and winner of the State Prize, he was denied admission to the academy more than 10 times, which is an exceptional case. In 1980, the only lifetime exhibition of the artist's paintings took place, coinciding with his 70th birthday. Recently, in 2012, a major exhibition of the artist's work was held at the Central House of Artists, where the paintings were presented to the general public for the first time since the exhibition in 1980. The artist executed approximately 100 paintings, with only a small number acquired by major museums.\n\n\n== Public activity ==\nMember of the VKP(b) since 1951.\nHe was involved in public life, frequently communicating with colleagues and art enthusiasts, and had a significant impact on the younger generation of Soviet artists. He participated in the activities of the Board of the Moscow Organization of the Union of Artists (MOSKh) and the Secretariat of the Union of Artists of the USSR, and served on many juries and commissions. The artist headed the commission responsible for allowing works by avant-garde artists of the New Reality studio to be exhibited at the 30 Years of the Moscow Artists' Union exhibition in the Moscow Manege in 1962. During Nikita Khrushchev's visit to the exhibition, he was infuriated by the non-conformist art, and as a result, the artist responsible for the exhibition was disgraced and had his contracts cancelled. They resumed working with him in 1964, only after Khrushchev had resigned as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.\nVitaly Nikolayevich Goryaev died on 12 April 1982 in Moscow. He is buried in Vagankovskoye cemetery (plot 24).\n\n\n== Creative method ==\n\nAccording to family members, the artist was highly productive. He began each morning by creating a few illustrations for urgent orders, and then proceeded to paint an easel work every day, whether it be a portrait, still life, or landscape. Colleagues noted that the artist worked in various locations, including at home, in the studio, on the street, and on the road. He was constantly sketching future works in his diaries and recording observations during meetings and appointments. In contrast, his illustrations for literary works required years of meticulous effort. For each book, he created approximately one hundred original illustrations and numerous preliminary drawings to develop the mise-en-scene and characters. He began with a blank book of the necessary format, planning the arrangement of illustrations and text to ensure a consistent unfolding of the story from page to page. The process of preparing the illustrations was complex. The artist created a pencil drawing, which was then transferred to photographic paper. A chemist adjusted the contrast according to instructions, and the final result was finished with ink and whites to ensure high-quality printing within the limited possibilities of printing.\nThe authorial style of the artist developed and crystallised over time. In the 1930s, the artist incorporated means and methods into his graphic works for magazines that were atypical for this art form. For example, he used thin lines in an Impressionist manner to convey the material flesh of things. During his time at Frontovoy Yumor, the artist's visual language became clearer and more concise due to difficult working conditions, tight deadlines, scarce printing resources, and the need to convey ideas to a wide audience. His works during this period for the magazine were not limited to caricatures, but also included genre works depicting military life. The satirical element was often conveyed through the use of sharp captions.\nThe artist's main method for genre drawing was not to work directly from nature, but to fixate impressions in memory or create quick sketches and reproduce what he saw in the studio. The artist did not aim to reproduce reality faithfully, but rather to reveal and emphasise the most important details. This approach resulted in works that were even more natural and truthful than the artist's own sketches. The artist developed his own system of studying people, focusing on how their character and social status are reflected in their postures, habits, gestures, and behaviour in different surroundings. He reduced the variety of human states to a few basic plastic positions, which he recorded on paper for many years by cultivating his powers of observation.\n\nThere is a tendency that guides me in choosing what I paint. It is my understanding of the world, my connection to it. A tendency is the desire of my people, my party, which has become my desire, dictating my choice and determining my attitude to what I want to paint. A trend gives rise to the artist's vision and method. It determines the strength and direction of his work.\nIn life drawings I am interested in contrasts: the meeting of dark with light, soft with hard, big with small, a stone city with a mountain or water, violence with passivity, prickly with soft, and so on. This search for contrasts allows me to operate freely with elements of nature and develop a compositional vision. I used to draw from life with little or no plastic connection between individual parts, objects and figures. Now I try to extract the truth of the artistic image from the elements of nature. What I have drawn is not documentary, but characteristic. Often, building the composition of the sheet, I put in the drawing figures, details, objects not in the place they occupy in nature, but from this depicted scenes do not lose their vitality, on the contrary, they become more convincing.\n\nIn order for me to start drawing from life, apart from a substantial and interesting subject, it is important for me to have what I call a \"constructive stimulus\", i.e. to be interested in some unexpected turn, combination of forms, construction and design of figures, movement. These constructive features best and most fully express both the psychology and character of a person and his actions - that is, habits, movements, postures.\n\n\n=== Family ===\nFirst wife – Valentina Pavlovna Deopik (1907–1990).\nSon – Dega Vitalievich Deopik (born 1932), Doctor of Historical Sciences, professor, orientalist.\nSecond wife – Taisia Borisovna Lobach-Zhuchenko (1920–2017).\nSon – Sergey Vitalievich Goryaev (1958–2013), People's Artist of the Russian Federation, professor.\nDaughter – Lyubov Vitalievna Goryaeva (born 1946), candidate of philological sciences, researcher and translator of ancient Malay manuscripts.\n\n\n== Awards and titles ==\n\n\n=== Titles ===\nHonored Artist of the RSFSR (1966)\nPeople's Artist of the RSFSR (1976)\nPeople's Artist of the RSFSR (1981)\n\n\n=== State awards ===\nUSSR State Prize (1967) - for illustrations for Dostoevsky's Petersburg Tales\nOrder of the Red Star (1945)\nMedal \"For Courage\" (1943)\nMedal \"For Battle Merit\"\nJubilee Medal \"In Commemoration of the 100th Anniversary of the Birth of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin\" (1970)\nMedal \"For the Capture of Königsberg\"\nMedal \"For the Victory over Germany in the Great Patriotic War 1941–1945\"\nJubilee Medal \"Twenty Years of Victory in the Great Patriotic War 1941–1945\"\nJubilee Medal \"Thirty Years of Victory in the Great Patriotic War 1941–1945\"\nJubilee Medal \"50 Years of the Armed Forces of the USSR\"\nJubilee Medal \"60 Years of the Armed Forces of the USSR\"\nOrder of Friendship (1974, Czechoslovakia)\n\n\n=== Creative Awards ===\nFirst degree diploma of the All-Union contest The Best Books (1962) – for illustrations to Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain\nFirst degree diploma of the All-Union contest The Best Books (1965) for illustrations to Petersburg Tales by Nikolai Gogol\nSecond degree diploma of the International Book Exhibition in Bratislava (1967) – for illustrations to Petersburg Tales by Nikolai Gogol\nGold Medal of the Czechoslovak Union of International Relations (1969) for services in the development of friendship and co-operation with Czechoslovakia\nHonorary plaquette Golden Apple (1975) - for participation in the organisation and holding of the International Biennale of Children's Books (BIB) in Bratislava\nGold Medal of the International Exhibition of Book Art in Leipzig (1975) - for a series of illustrations for Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel The Idiot\n\n\n== Exhibitions and publications ==\n\n\n=== Exhibitions ===\n\n\n=== Books ===\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nGoryaev's works are featured in several prestigious collections, including the Tretyakov Gallery, the Russian Museum, the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, the State Literary Museum, the Museum of Russian Art in Harbin, and various art galleries in Odesa, Perm, Yekaterinburg, Kursk, and other cities.

Goryaev Sr. purchased the flat from the 1st Artists' Co-operative Society in 1957 and lived there until his passing. The studio he occupied from 1970 is also part of the museum. In the 1990s, the artist's son inherited his workshop and subsequently organised an exposition, which led to the opening of a museum in 1996. In 2012, he also initiated the installation of a memorial plaque on the house. The museum's collection comprises paintings, sketches, book graphics, archives, and the artist's personal art collection. Notably, it includes works by Pyotr Miturich, Dmitry Mitrohin, Mikhail Kupriyanov, Aleksandr Sokolov, Vladimir Konashevich, and a lithograph hand-painted in watercolour gifted by Pablo Picasso.\n\n\n== Memory ==\nOn 7 May 1985, Chernoozernaya Street, located in the Northern settlement of Kurgan, was named after the artist.\nA memorial plaque by N. B. Nikoghosyan was erected in 2012 on the house located at 7/9 Begovaya St. in Moscow, where V. N. Goryaev lived and worked from 1957 to 1982.\nA festival was held in the Kurgan region from March to June 2010 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Vitaly Nikolayevich Goryaev, a People's Artist of the USSR.\nIn 2010–2012, several anniversary exhibitions were held in Moscow, Kurgan, Samara, and Abramtsevo to commemorate Goryaev.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"The Press: Russians in Wall Street\".

        "content": "Timothy Jack McCoy (May 14, 1955 – January 3, 1972) was an American murder victim from Omaha, Nebraska. He is the first known victim of American serial killer and sex offender John Wayne Gacy, who murdered, raped and tortured at least 33 young men and boys between 1972 and 1978. He was murdered by Gacy on January 3, 1972, in Chicago, Illinois, and was buried in the crawl space of his home. McCoy's corpse was not found for nearly seven years until December 1978, where his body along with several others were recovered and was conclusively identified on May 9, 1986, via dental records, 14 years after his death.\nPrior to his identification, McCoy was known as the Greyhound Bus Boy, which was in reference to the Greyhound Bus Terminal in Chicago, Illinois, where he first encountered Gacy and eventually disappeared. After his identification, his remains (which were buried under an unmarked gravestone) were returned to his family in Glenwood, Iowa.\n\n\n== Background ==\nTimothy Jack McCoy was born on May 14, 1955, in Council Bluffs, Iowa. McCoy had travelled the country for the majority of his life, living in the states of Iowa, Nebraska, Florida and California. McCoy was a fan of rock music, with his favorite album being Cosmo's Factory by Creedence Clearwater Revival. He had numerous cousins on his mother's side in various parts of the country, with one of his cousins, Jeffrey Billings, describing McCoy as \"one of them guys that, when you were around him, he was happy, he'd make you laugh\" and adding that \"He always had something to say.\" McCoy had also apparently worked as a forklift operator at Blue Star Foods Inc. nearby Council Bluffs. His parents, Jack McCoy and Susie Study split in the early 1970s.\n\nFor Christmas 1971, McCoy (along with one of his aunt's sons) visited his cousins in Michigan and spent the Christmas holidays there. A few days later, his cousins and their parents dropped him off at the Capital Area Multimodal Gateway in East Lansing, with McCoy promising to call back once he returned to his aunt's house in Omaha. This is the last time McCoy's family would hear from him.\n\n\n== Disappearance and murder ==\nMcCoy arrived in Chicago, Illinois, on January 2, 1972. His bus to Iowa was not scheduled to depart until noon of the next day, which gave him some time to spend in Chicago. He then stumbled upon a man named John Wayne Gacy, who offered to drive him around the city and give him a sightseeing tour after McCoy told him his bus wasn't due for some hours, which he obliged to. According to Gacy's account, after their trip, Gacy drove McCoy to 8213 West Summerdale Avenue in Norwood Park Township, which was where his ranch-style house was located, with Gacy promising McCoy that he could spend the night at his house and be driven to the bus station in the morning so he could catch his bus. Gacy said that him and McCoy drank alcohol together and he also claimed that the two performed oral sex on each other, despite the fact that McCoy was straight, but it remains truly unknown whether this had actually happened or whether this was consensual. Afterwards, Gacy said he felt tired and they both went to sleep separately.\nIn the early hours of January 3, 1972, Gacy claimed to have awoken to find McCoy holding a kitchen knife walking towards his bed. According to Gacy, he jumped from his bed and charged at McCoy, trying to grab the knife. McCoy held up the knife to protect himself as Gacy reached for his wrist, which accidentally cut Gacy's arm. He said that after his arm was slashed, he was \"no longer the sick individual who was physically weak\" and \"I felt ten times stronger than I ever was before.\" Gacy said he grabbed McCoy and threw him against the wall, which was followed by McCoy kicking Gacy in the stomach, which doubled him over. Gacy remembered saying: \"Motherfucker. I'll kill you.\" Gacy then wrestled McCoy to the floor and stabbed McCoy several times in the chest. As McCoy lay dying, Gacy washed the bloody knife in the bathroom and headed into the kitchen, where he saw McCoy's supposed making of breakfast; he had set the table for two and intended to walk into Gacy's room to wake him while absentmindedly carrying the knife. McCoy eventually died of his stab wounds; he was 16 years old.\n\n\n=== Aftermath ===\n\nAfter his death, McCoy's body was placed in the crawl space of Gacy's home and because Gacy's mother was visiting later that same day, he walked around his house checking for blood stains he may have missed. He later dug a shallow grave in the crawl space and buried McCoy's remains there, later covering his grave with a layer of concrete. Between 1974 and 1978, Gacy would go on to murder at least 32 more victims and buried 25 of the victims in the crawl space along with McCoy's body; he was Gacy's first known victim. He evaded capture from the police for six years until his arrest in December 1978.\nOn January 3, 1972, the same day McCoy was killed, his aunt went to the bus depot in Omaha to pick him up only to see no sign of him, despite the fact the bus had arrived on schedule from Chicago. As the year went on, McCoy's family began growing increasingly concerned as they had not heard anything from him at all. Therefore, his father, Jack, hired a private investigator in Chicago. McCoy's disappearance was mysterious to his family, as he'd never been known to run away from home. In March 1973, McCoy's grandfather had also passed away in Iowa. When McCoy failed to show up to the funeral, his family lost all hope that he would ever return.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\n\nMcCoy's body remained undiscovered for nearly seven years. However, after a 15-year-old boy named Robert Piest disappeared in December 1978, the Des Plaines Police did a check of John Wayne Gacy's criminal background and found out that Gacy had an outstanding battery charge in Chicago and had previously been imprisoned in 1968 in the state of Iowa for the sodomy of a then 15-year-old boy named Donald Voorhees Jr., son of Donald E. Voorhees, in 1967, five years before Gacy murdered McCoy. As police suspected Gacy may be holding Piest hostage in the same house McCoy died in years prior, the Des Plaines Police obtained a search warrant on December 13, 1978, to no avail, but they did find suspicious items, leading them to confiscate Gacy's vehicles and put Gacy under surveillance.\nOn December 15, Des Plaines investigators obtained further details of Gacy's battery charge, learning Jeffrey Rignall had reported that Gacy had lured him into his car, then chloroformed, raped and tortured him before dumping him in Lincoln Park months ago. In an interview with Gacy's former wife the same day, they learned of John Butkovich's disappearance; he was killed by Gacy in 1975. Four days later, on December 19, investigators began compiling evidence for a second search warrant for Gacy's house. The same day, Gacy's lawyers filed a $750,000 lawsuit against the Des Plaines police; the hearing for the suit was scheduled to take place on December 22. On December 21, the Des Plaines Police were granted a second search warrant. After police informed Gacy of their intentions to search his crawl space for the body of Piest, Gacy denied the teenager was buried there, but confessed to having killed in self-defense a young man whose body was buried under his garage, whom he would later identify as Butkovich. Gacy was arrested the very same day, and McCoy's body along with the 25 other victims stored in his crawl space were unearthed over the next week, with three others also being unearthed elsewhere on his property.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nMcCoy was the ninth victim of Gacy's to be recovered; he had several stab wounds to the ribs and sternum, suggesting he was Gacy's first victim. He was the only victim to have been stabbed; all of the other victims were strangled. A Model A belt buckle was also recovered from McCoy's body. Gacy was brought to trial on February 6, 1980. On March 13, Gacy was found guilty of 33 counts of murder, indecent liberties with a child and deviate sexual assault. He was sentenced to death and was transferred to the Menard Correctional Center, where he was on death row for 14 years before being executed by lethal injection at the Stateville Correctional Center on May 10, 1994, aged 52.\n\n\n=== Funeral ===\nOn June 12, 1981, the unidentified remains of McCoy as well as eight other unidentified victims of Gacy (three of whom have since been since identified) were all buried in separate cemeteries, with inscriptions upon their unmarked tombstones that read: \"We Remembered.\" Tom Moriarty, the executive secretary of the Funeral Directors Services Association, stated that the burial sites would not be revealed in order to prevent them from becoming tourist attractions.\nIn February 1986, Beverly Billings Howe, one of McCoy's cousins located in Lansing, Michigan, read an excerpt of Tim Cahill's book Buried Dreams: Inside the Mind of a Serial Killer, which was soon due to be released and covered Gacy's life and story. She had read about Gacy's first victim, who had been killed in Chiacgo shortly after New Year's Day 1972. The victim, who was unidentified, was referred to as the \"Greyhound Bus Boy\" in the book, and was stabbed to death in Gacy's home. McCoy's relatives had previously suspected Gacy's possible involvement of his disappearance after their last interaction with him in January 1972 and they had heard nothing from McCoy ever since. She proceeded to show the excerpt she had read to her sister, who was also surprised upon reading it.\nThe family was sure that McCoy was one of the nine unidentified victims and they made calls to people in Chicago to find out more information, which led to them eventually getting ahold of Tim Cahill, the author of the book, and Cahill soon interviewed Beverly and her family. She had recalled in the interview how she had given McCoy a Model A belt buckle which he loved. The same belt buckle was recovered from his body when it was discovered in 1978. This detail interested Cahill and from there, he and journalist Russ Ewing tried to find McCoy's dental records, which were successfully located in Florida, where the McCoy family had previously lived and were passed on to the Cook County Medical Examiner.\n\n\n== Identification ==\nAfter three months of investigating, Timothy Jack McCoy's identity as one of the nine unidentified victims of Gacy was confirmed on May 9, 1986, eight years after his body was recovered and 14 years after his murder. This now left only eight of the victims unidentified (three of whom have since been identified). After McCoy was identified, his family had learned that one of his aunts, who went by Aunt Tiny, who was supposed to send off McCoy's dental records to Chicago in 1979 hadn't actually done so, as she didn't want to upset the family if it was revealed that McCoy had died.\nDr. John Pavlik, an Olympia Fields orthodontist and chief of forensic science for the Cook County Sheriff's police who made the identification of McCoy possible, stated that McCoy's fillings were \"very unique\" and his fillings were something only 2-3% of the population had. He also said that McCoy had \"certain unique teeth\", which helped reduce the percentage of error to the point that he could conclude that McCoy was likely Gacy's first victim.\n\n\n=== Second funeral ===\nSoon after his identification, McCoy's remains were returned to his family, who were living in Glenwood, Iowa. A funeral for McCoy was planned, but as his family were tight on money, the cost was picked up a funeral director and an airline. A week and a half after what would have been McCoy's 31st birthday, he was buried at the Westlawn-Hillcrest Funeral Home and Memorial Park in Omaha, Nebraska. He was laid to rest beside his father, Jack McCoy, who also passed away in 1983. One of McCoy's siblings, Linda McCoy, stated that Timothy's disappearance \"hurt his father the most\" and was glad he passed away before his son was identified so he \"never had to know\". Linda was unable to make the funeral as she was pregnant with a son who was about to be born, but as soon as she could, she travelled to Omaha and stood beside Jack and Timothy's tombstones. McCoy's tombstone reads: \"Our Beloved Son And Brother. Timothy Jack McCoy.\" On his tombstone, McCoy's name is seen under a golden mountain.\nAfter McCoy's identification, no developments would be made to identify the other remaining eight victims for 25 years until October 2011, where the Cook County Sheriff Thomas Dart announced that the Cook County Police would be renewing their efforts to identify the remaining victims of Gacy. Three victims, William George Bundy (19, identified in November 2011), James Byron Haakenson (16, identified in July 2017) and Francis Wayne Alexander (21, identified in October 2021) have since been identified. Five victims still remain unidentified.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCrime in Illinois\nJohn Wayne Gacy\nList of murdered American children\nList of solved missing person cases: pre-2000\nUnidentified decedent\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Cited works and further reading ==\nAmirante, Sam L.; Broderick, Danny (2011).

        "content": "Ragna Róbertsdóttir (born 1945 in Reykjavík) is an Icelandic artist. She was educated in Iceland and Sweden.\n\n\n== Life and education ==\nRagna Róbertsdóttir studied at the Icelandic College of Art and Crafts in the 1960s during the time of Kurt Zier and Hörður Ágústsson. The school at the time still placed a lot of emphasis on drawing, although students there were taught the basic principles in applying different techniques and media. After finishing graduate school at Konstfack in Stockholm between the years of 1970–1971, Ragna participated in an awakening that emerged in women's art in the 1970s.\n\n\n== Career ==\nRagna, together with 11 other women, founded Gallerí Langbrók. The gallery's last exhibition was held in 1985. Then, in the early 1980s, Ragna began to make the art that she is known for today. At that time, natural materials became the dominant medium in her work, much of it consisting of sod and lava rock. In Ragna's art, sod is placed together in large rolls that form variously sized installations. She also uses lava rock that has been sawed down into little pieces, which are arranged and laid over the installations. She has mainly exhibited her work in Iceland, but also in other countries like France, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and Norway.\n\n\n== Notable works ==\nThe Akureyri Art Museum in 2013: On Guðrúnar Einarsdóttir and Ragna Róbertsdóttir's exhibitions by Margrét Ólafsdóttir\ni8 Gallery, January 17, 2013: Ragna Róbertsdóttir\nNational Gallery of Iceland 2003: Á mörkum málverksins (\"On the Limits of Art\")\nAkademie Schloss Solitude 1999: Two landscapes\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Kevin M. Sullivan (born February 2, 1955) is an American history and true crime author whose works include seven books about serial killer Ted Bundy, along with several other crime books. He lives in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\n\n== Career ==\nA retired minister, Sullivan has written 18 books, seven of which are about serial killer Ted Bundy, including Ted Bundy's Murderous Mysteries: The Many Victims of America's Most Infamous Serial Killer and The Bundy Murders:  A Comprehensive History. He also teamed with New York Times bestselling crime author Gregg Olsen to write Unnatural Causes, along with three other co-authored titles with Olsen.\nKatherine Ramsland, author of The Human Predator, in 2016 wrote about Sullivan's book The Trail of Ted Bundy in Psychology Today, noting, \"Even if you think you already know everything there is to know about Ted Bundy, you’ll probably learn something new from this companion book. If you don’t know much about this poster boy for American serial killers, Sullivan’s renderings offer a solid and chilling portrait.\" In 2023, Ramsland listed and analyzed, in a Psychology Today article, five myths about Bundy gleaned from Sullivan's book Ted Bundy: The Yearly Journal.\nThe Book Authority included Sullivan's The Bundy Murders on its list of \"20 Best Murder Biography Books of All Time.\"\nPortions of Sullivan's biography of Bundy are included in the college textbook Abnormal Psychology: Clinical Perspectives on Psychological Disorders, by Susan Krauss Whitbourne and published by McGraw-Hill in November 2012.\nHe appeared in a 2018 Reelz documentary \"Ted Bundy: Serial Monster\" TV Series. He also appeared in a TV miniseries \"Ted Bundy: The Survivors\" in 2020, produced by Michael Hoff Productions. He appeared as well in two more Oxygen network segments in 2018, including \"Snapped Notorious: Ted Bundy\" an eerie documentary of Bundy's life and the segment \"Who Was Ted Bundy? Everything You Need To Know About The Twisted, 'Charming' Serial Killer.\"\nSullivan appeared in ABC's 20/20 special, \"Life with Bundy\" in January 2020. The segment was re-released on ABC's Nightline show.\nAn excerpt published by A&E Networks of Sullivan's book Ted Bundy's Murderous Mysteries in an article titled Ted Bundy, Babysitter covered Bundy's relationships with children when Bundy babysat for them.\nAbout Bundy, the Fort Collins Coloradoan newspaper quoted Sullivan as saying, \"He understood that normal people are not thinking about people like him tracking them and hunting them.\"\nHe participated as a guest speaker in Duquesne University's 18th annual Forensic Science and Law Symposium in September 2019.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\n\n\n==== Non-fiction ====\nShattering the Myth: Signposts on Custer's Road to Disaster (1996, Professional Press) (ISBN 978-1570871955)\nDeath of a Cheerleader (co-authored with Gregg Olsen) (2014, Notorious USA) (ASIN B00KWTVK3U)\nAngel of Death (co-authored with Gregg Olsen) (2014, Notorious USA) (ASIN B00MAVSCLG)\nThe Amish Schoolhouse Murders (co-authored with Gregg Olsen) (2014, Notorious USA) (ASIN B00MAZATTA)\nUnnatural Causes: Notorious USA: Kentucky, Pennsylvania & Ohio (co-authored with Gregg Olsen) (2014, CreateSpace) (ISBN 978-1501023491)\nTHE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THE TED BUNDY MURDERS (2020, Wildblue Press) (ISBN 978-1948239615)\nKentucky Bloodbath: Ten Bizarre Tales of Murder From The Bluegrass State (2015, Wildblue Press) (ISBN 978-1942266174)\nThe Trail of Ted Bundy: Digging Up the Untold Stories (2016, Wildblue Press) (ISBN 978-1942266372)\nVampire: The Richard Chase Murders (2015, Wildblue Press) (ISBN 978-1942266112)\nThe Bundy Secrets: Hidden Files on America's Worst Serial Killer (2017, Wildblue Press') (ISBN 978-1942266853)\nThrough an Unlocked Door: In Walks Murder (2018, Exposit Books) (ISBN 978-1476668857)\nTed Bundy's Murderous Mysteries: The Many Victims Of America's Most Infamous Serial Killer (2019, Wildblue Press) (ISBN 978-1948239158)\nThe Enigma of Ted Bundy (2020, Wildblue Press) (ISBN 978-1952225383)\nThe Bundy Murders: A Comprehensive History, 2nd ed.

        "content": "The Lagos International Poetry Festival, also often called LIPFest, is an annual festival of poetry which takes place in Lagos, Nigeria. Referred to as \"an annual haven for Nigerian and international creatives, especially poets,\" LIPFest was founded by Efe Paul Azino, Nigerian spoken word artist and poet, to bring together an international array of poets, writers, artists, and public intellectuals to Lagos for a week of readings and performances, panel discussions, workshops, community outreaches, and a celebration of the art of poetry in general.\n\n\n== History ==\nAzino decided to create the festival as \"a platform to cater to the growing number of poets in Lagos and Nigeria at large, due to the absence of such kind of festival\" so as “to create a space in Lagos, every year,  where poets from across the world could come to celebrate the written and spoken words.”  The first edition in October 2015 was themed Borderless Words. Since its founding, it has been committed \"to promoting poetry as a tool for social change and personal expression.\"\n\n\n== Events and activities ==\nEach year the festival is curated around specific themes designed to spark conversations and centre the concerns that shape our world. Activities typically include readings and performances, panel discussions on a broad range of topics, workshops, book launches, film screenings, and international cultural exchanges. Previous exchange programmes have included partnerships with the Southbank Centre, Poetry Africa, and Moniack Mhor, Scotland's National Writing Center. The festival also presents an annual poetry slam, a competitive showcase of young, talented spoken word artists and performance poets.\n\n\n== Notable participants ==\nTaking place in the culturally busy Lagos October season, alongside notable events like the Lagos Fashion Week, Lagos Photo Festival, and Art X, LIPFest is a global connecting point for established and emerging voices. Notable guests include stalwart pioneers like Nobel Prize winner, Wole Soyinka, J.P. Clark, and Niyi Osundare, Booker Prize winner, Bernadine Evaristo, Kwame Dawes, Chris Abani, Jericho Brown, Lebo Mashile, Titilope Sonuga, Saul Williams, Kola Tubosun, Aja Monet, Danez Smith, Romeo Oriogun, Kaveh Akbhar, Raymond Antrobus, Koleka Putuma, Bassey Ikpi, TJ Dema, Rudy Francisco, Inua Ellams, Jumoke Verissimo, Nadine Aisha Jassat, Victoria Adukwei Bulley, Wana Udobang, and many other poets.\n\n\n== Impact and significance ==\nThe Lagos International Poetry Festival has made significant contributions to the cultural scene in Lagos and Nigeria as a whole. It has played a crucial role in the revival of poetry and spoken word as mainstream art forms and has been instrumental in fostering a sense of community among poets and literature enthusiasts. Its annual workshops and outreach programmes have served as a platform for nurturing the next generation of African poets and writers. Its global stage also provides a platform for established and emerging acts to connect to new audiences. The festival's annual poetry slam competition showcases and rewards some of Nigeria's best-spoken word and performance poetry talent.\nIn 2022 the festival launched its annual print and digital journal Márọkọ, connecting generations of African poets to readers across the world.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Grecia was a literary magazine which was published from 1918 to 1920 in Spain. Its subtitle was Revista Decenal de Literatura (Spanish: Decennial Literature Magazine). Later it was redesigned as Revista de literatura (Spanish: Literature Magazine). It was a traditionalist as reflected in its title and modernist publication in the early years, but later adopted an avant-garde approach and became the flagship of the ultraísmo.\n\n\n== History and profile ==\nGrecia was established by the Andalusian poet Isaac del Vando Villar in Seville in 1918 as a modernist literary magazine. Its first issue appeared on 18 October 1918. Adriano del Valle was the first editor-in-chief of the magazine which had 24 pages throughout its run.Although Grecia adhered to modernism, over time it covered the work by writers from distinct literary waves such as futurism, cubism, dadaism and expressionism. The first manifesto of the ultraísmo group was published in the magazine in 1919. The group included Guillermo de Torre, Rafael Cansinos-Asséns, Gerardo Diego and Jorge Luis Borges. Following this incident Grecia became the leading media outlet of the avant-garde in Spain. In addition, it played a significant role in the introduction of the ultraísmo in other Spanish-speaking countries, including Mexico. Pedro Garfias published his poem Domingo (Spanish: Sunday) in the magazine which was a typical example of the ultraist poetry.The headquarters of Grecia moved to Madrid in the summer of 1920. During this period Rafael Cansinos-Asséns edited the magazine. Its title page and header was redesigned by Norah Borges to reflect its avant-garde character. The magazine folded in November 1920.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE) is a non-profit organization of volunteer counselors who provide free mentoring, education programs, workshops, and webinars to small businesses. SCORE is a resource partner of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) who administers a Congressional grant which provides SCORE with funding. SCORE is headquartered in Herndon, Virginia, with over 233 chapters which are located in offices located throughout the United States. It is the nation’s largest network of volunteer, expert business mentors.\n\n\n== History ==\nSCORE was chartered by an Act of the U.S. Congress in 1964 to provide technical and managerial guidance to the business community, profit and not-for-profit organizations, and prospective\nentrepreneurs through the use of volunteer counselors. On October 5, 1964, SBA administrator, Eugene P. Foley officially launched SCORE. Walter H. Channing of Detroit, Michigan, served as its first president. By 1968 over 1,000 small businesses per month were receiving free business advice from SCORE. Since its founding it has helped over 10 million entrepreneurs.\nA 2019 audit by the Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General (OIG) was highly critical of SCORE, finding that SCORE officials did not effectively oversee SCORE's use of federal funds, inappropriately solicited donations for mentoring services, charged for publication material that did not include the required SBA acknowledgement statement and improperly managed funds used for cosponsored activities. The OIG recommended that the SBA improve its oversight and monitoring of SCORE's use of government funds, and its reporting of performance results.  The OIG also recommended that the SBA recover $713,986 of unallowable and unsupported costs.\nBy 2021 SCORE began to emphasize the importance diversity, equity and inclusion in business (DEI).  \nIn 2023, Iowa Senator Joni Ernst introduced a bill in the U.S. Senate, S-1896, entitled the SCORE Act of 2023 which would \"overhaul SCORE to meet the needs of today’s dynamic economy and improve support for female and rural business owners\".\n\n\n== Operations ==\nSCORE is governed by a 19 member board of directors.  It has a team of approximately 50 salaried employees at its headquarters in Herndon, Virginia who support the organization of over 10,000 volunteers in 250 office locations throughout the U.S.\nSCORE is primarily supported by a government grant, workshop fees and contributions. SCORE receives a majority of its financial support from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). SCORE is also supported by the SCORE Foundation, a 501 (c) (3) non-profit organization formed in 1996 to serve as the philanthropic arm of SCORE.\nSCORE is exempt from federal and state income taxes on income under the provisions of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.\nSCORE's website offers a comprehensive small business library with “how-to” guides, downloadable templates, checklists, articles, videos, infographics, and blogs. The website also hosts online workshops, and recorded webinars and interactive courses on demand.\nSCORE volunteer mentors give free and confidential business advice to business owners using different communication methods, including phone, video, email and in-person meetings.  There are four types of SCORE volunteering opportunities: business mentors, workshop presenters, subject matter experts and chapter support roles\nFrom time to time SCORE gives the Walter H Channing Award.  Named in honor of its founding president, it is the highest honor for volunteer service within SCORE.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nNellis, Elwyn A. (1989).

        "content": "Albert B. Jewett (March 20, 1829 – March 6, 1887) was an American businessman and military officer from Vermont. A Union Army veteran of the American Civil War, Jewett commanded the  10th Vermont Infantry Regiment from 1862 to 1864.\nA native of St. Albans Town, Vermont, Jewett was educated in the local schools and operated a store in the village of  Swanton. At the outbreak of the Civil War, he joined a militia company that was inducted into federal service as Company A, 1st Vermont Infantry Regiment. He was elected the company's first lieutenant, and served with the 1st Vermont during its entire three months of duty, including participation in the June 1861 Battle of Big Bethel.\nAfter returning to Vermont at the end of his enlistment, Jewett assisted in recruiting the 10th Vermont Infantry Regiment; Colonel William Y. W. Ripley was nominated to serve as commander, but relinquished the position because he was still recovering from wounds received earlier in the war. Jewett was then appointed as the regimental commander, and he served until resigning in April 1864; he led the unit during several campaigns and engagements, including the June 1863 Battle of Brandy Station.\nAfter resigning his commission, Jewett returned to Vermont and resumed operation of his store in Swanton. In 1871, he purchased an interest in the St. Johnsbury and Lake Champlain Railroad and became superintendent of its day-to-day operations. Jewett was also involved in other businesses, including sawmills, as well as steamboats, wharves, and a train station on Lake Champlain. From 1876 to 1878, he served on the military staff of Governor Horace Fairbanks with the rank of colonel. Jewett's health began to decline in 1885, and he died on March 6, 1887, while spending the winter in Jacksonville, Florida. Jewett was buried at Church Street Cemetery in Swanton.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nAlbert Burton Jewett was born in the town of St. Albans, Vermont, on March 20, 1829, a son of Eleazer and Dorothy (Abell) Jewett. Among his siblings were Erastus W. Jewett, a Civil War recipient of the Medal of Honor, and Jesse A. Jewett, a captain in the 5th Vermont Infantry Regiment who died of illness shortly after the end of the war.\nAlbert Jewett was raised and educated in St. Albans, and in 1850 became the owner and operator of a general store in Swanton. He managed the store with different partners at different times throughout the 1850s, including his brother Jason and Colonel Elisha Leonard Barney, who was killed in 1864 while commanding the 6th Vermont Infantry Regiment. In 1851, Jewett married Achsa M. Griffin (1833–1912). They were the parents of two children, Frances Emily (1852–1871), the wife of J. Azro Gould, and George Abell (1860–1880). At the start of the American Civil War, Jewett belonged to a company of the Vermont Militia, Company C, 4th Regiment also known as the Green Mountain Guards.\n\n\n== Military service ==\n\nJewett was serving as first lieutenant of the Green Mountain Guards when the company was inducted into federal service as Company A, 1st Vermont Infantry Regiment. The 1st Vermont carried out three months of active duty, primarily in Virginia, and Jewett continued to serve as Company A's first lieutenant. He was with his company when it took part in the Battle of Big Bethel near Newport News on June 10, 1861.\nAfter the 1st Vermont's term of service ended, Jewett returned to Vermont, where he assisted in recruiting a new regiment, the 10th Vermont Infantry, of which he became second in command as a lieutenant colonel. The regiment was originally commanded by William Y. W. Ripley, who relinquished the position because he was recovering from wounds he received earlier in the war, which left him unable to lead troops in combat. Jewett succeeded Ripley as commander in August 1862 and was promoted to colonel.\nDuring Jewett's command, the 10th Vermont took part in the Civil War Defenses of Washington, with companies and detachments manning outposts around the outskirts of the city. For nearly a year, Jewett commanded a brigade at Offutt's Crossroads, Maryland, which included the 10th Vermont, 39th Massachusetts, 14th New Hampshire, and 23rd Maine. In late 1863, Jewett commanded the 10th Vermont during the Battle of Mine Run, where his personal gallantry and coolness under fire earned him commendations from his brigade and division commanders. An extended illness led to Jewett resigning his commission in April 1864, and he was succeeded by William W. Henry; before he departed for home, a meeting of the 10th Vermont's officers passed a resolution praising his service as their commander, which they communicated to several Vermont newspapers.\n\n\n== Business career ==\n\nAfter the war, Jewett was one of the founders of the Reunion Society of Vermont Officers. He was also a member of the Grand Army of the Republic, and was active for many years in the Swanton and St. Johnsbury posts. Jewett was an active Freemason, and from 1875 to 1876 he was Grand Commander of Vermont's Knights Templar. He was active in politics as a Republican, attended local conventions as a delegate, and served in Swanton town offices including highway surveyor and select board member.\nFollowing his military service, Jewett resumed management of his Swanton store and invested in ventures including a Swanton Falls peat bed. In the early 1870s, he became active in railroad management when he helped organize the St. Johnsbury and Lake Champlain Railroad. He became the superintendent of the railway's operations, and eventually became its vice president. He resided in St. Johnsbury, but continued to maintain his home of record in Swanton. In addition to managing the railroad, Jewett held an ownership stake in an Essex County lumber business and invested in St. Johnsbury real estate. His enterprises in the Swanton area included a quicklime factory, which he owned in partnership with his brother Erastus and others.\nIn connection with the St. Johnsbury and Lake Champlain Railroad, Jewett was also a partner in a venture that constructed and operated a steamboat on Lake Champlain, which made trips between the Maquam Bay near Swanton, Plattsburgh, New York, and several Lake Champlain islands. This enterprise also expanded to other amenities that facilitated the movement of freight and passengers, including a train station, wharves, and a hotel on the bay. From 1876 to 1878, Jewett served on the military staff of Governor Horace Fairbanks with the rank of colonel.\nIn 1885, Jewett's health began to decline, and he lost movement in his left leg. During the winter of 1886–1887, he traveled to Florida in hope that a milder climate would facilitate his recovery. He died in Jacksonville, Florida, on March 6, 1887. Jewett's funeral took place in Swanton, and he was buried at Swanton's Church Street Cemetery.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Diario Palentino is a general information newspaper published in the Spanish city of Palencia. With more than a century of journalistic activity, it currently belongs to the Promecal group.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was founded on 15 May 1881, under the initiative of José Alonso Rodríguez. It was a publication of Catholic ideology and very conservative, although independent. José Alonso de Ojeda was the director of Diario Palentino for more than half a century. During the Second Republic, the publication maintained an editorial line close to the CEDA. \nIn January 1941 it merged with another existing conservative newspaper in Palencia called El Día de Palencia, owned by Abundio Zurita — a Catholic confessional newspaper established on 1 October 1890—  and was renamed El Diario Palentino-El Día de Palencia. From the 1980s onwards, the ownership of the newspaper was acquired by the Alonso family who, in 1998, sold 95% of the ownership of the newspaper to Grupo Promecal, the publishing company of Diario de Burgos, which took charge of its complete updating, changing its headquarters and providing it with new media and technology.\nIts headquarters are located in Calle Mayor de Palencia, and it shares it with its colleagues of the Promecal group, Canal 4 (integrated since 2009 in Radio Televisión de Castilla y León). It also has two regional offices in Guardo and Aguilar de Campoo, run by Sandra Macho and Marta Redondo respectively.\nAccording to the OJD, in the period July 2005/June 2006, the average circulation was 4991 copies, with a circulation of 4365.\nIt was one of the few Spanish evening dailies until the 1990s.\nThe Sociedad Estatal Correos y Telégrafos de España, known as Correos, issued a postage stamp corresponding to the series Diarios centenarios, which went on sale on 16 May 2005, designed by Ion Echeveste, which reproduces the image of the Cristo del Otero, the work of Victorio Macho, the city's coat of arms, and a rooster symbolising the salesmen or spokesmen and which forms part of the newspaper's corporate identity.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBuisán Cítores, Félix (1983).

The pageant's winners represent the province of Barcelona either in Miss Grand Spain or Miss Grand Catalonia pageants.\nSince the first competition in the Miss Grand Spain pageant, Barcelona representatives have not won the main title yet. The highest obtained placement was the top 11, won by an appointed Jennifer Hueso in 2017. Meanwhile, at the autonomy-level competition, Miss Grand Barcelona's representative, Carla Domènech, won the title of Miss Grand Lleida in 2023.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter Vicente Gonzalez acquired the license for Miss Grand Spain in 2015, he began franchising the provincial competitions to individual organizers, who would name the provincial representatives to compete in the national pageant the following year. In the province of Barcelona, the license was granted to an event organizer, Tamara Llorente, who organized the first Miss Grand Barcelona in 2018 when Marta Bellido was named the first Miss Grand Barcelona elected via the provincial pageant directly. From 2016 to 2017, Barcelona joined the Miss Grand Spain pageant with the representation of appointed representatives.\nFrom 2018 to 2022, the winner of the Miss Grand Barcelona pageant directly qualified for the national contest. Later in 2023, after the establishment of an autonomy-level pageant, Miss Grand Catalonia, the representatives of the province of Barcelona for Miss Grand Spain were determined through such a contest, and the winners of the Miss Grand Barcelona pageants would be assigned to represent one of the municipalities in the said autonomy-level pageant instead.\nIn 2021, in addition to the main provincial stage, local pageants were also held in Anoia, Baix Llobregat, and Osona, to determine delegates for the province competition.\n\n\n== Editions ==\nThe following table details Miss Grand Barcelona's annual editions since 2018.\n\nNotes\n\n\n== Autonomy-level competition ==\nBeginning in 2023, the Miss Grand Barcelona pageant winner would compete in the Miss Grand Catalonia pageant, where representatives of the four Catalan provinces—Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida, and Girona—would be elected for the Miss Grand Spain national competition.\n\n\n== National competition ==\nThe following is a list of representatives of the province of Barcelona in the Miss Grand Spain national pageant. Since 2023, the representatives were determined through the Miss Grand Catalonia pageant.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Miss Grand Spain at Wikimedia Commons\nMiss Grand Spain official website",

        "content": "\"Choro\" is a song by Mexican singer Thalía and Estilo Sin Límite co-written by her for her upcoming twentieth studio album. It was released by Sony Music Latin as the album's second single on November 30, 2023, following the success of the album's first single which reached the top spots on iTunes in countries like Mexico, Chile, and the Dominican Republic in its first week.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nThe song was written by Thalía herself along with Dania from, Jimmy Humilde, and Thomas Alexander. The song was produced by Edgar Rodríguez whit Humilde serving as executive producer. The song's title is inspired by the popular Mexican language, which refers to an exaggerated person who uses his words to make people fall in love. This latest single narrates the freedom of the artists and their liberation from the chains of those arrogant men who seek to conquer them. The song is a mix of Regional Mexican music in the modern day style known as corrido tumbado. The song's lyrics are very empowering for women. The song was considered  to be another way for Thalía to reinvent herself.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nFollowing the release of the song, it was received with humor in Chile due to the song's title having a different meaning in that country. Although in Mexico, the term “choro” is associated with talking a lot and in an exaggerated manner and in countries like Colombia and Perú the word means \"theif\", in Chilean territory it has a different connotation, colloquially referring to the female intimate area. Thalía was unaware of the word \"choro\" having that meaning in Chile and on December 5 \n2023 she released a video on her TikTok showing her reaction to the meaning of the word in different countries.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe music video came out on the same day as the song and it reached over 55 thousand views in 14 hours. The music video tells the story of the protagonists, highlighting their differences, but showing how they unite in sisterhood to express their distrust towards any \"choro.\" Directed and produced by Eduardo González, the video incorporates elements of Mexican culture and Chicano subculture through its chromatic narrative and setting.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Boston Adventure is a 1943 novel by Jean Stafford. It was her first published novel and was a surprise best-seller, launching her career as a writer.\nSet shortly before World War II, it tells the story of  Sonia Marburg, who grew up in Chichester, a small fishing village on the North Shore facing Boston. Deserted by her father and burdened with an insane mother, she dreams of life on the imagined splendor of Beacon Hill, a rich neighborhood in Boston.

        "content": "Indirect presidential elections were held in December 1988 to elect the 7th President of Pakistan. The votes were given by the Electoral College of Pakistan, which had its new members in both national and provincial assemblies elected in the corresponding 1988 Pakistani general election.\nThe elections saw a deal struck between the already ruling Independent caretaker president, Ghulam Ishaq Khan and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) as well as the Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI). With support from the two largest parties, Ishaq Khan won the elections with ease.\n\n\n== Background, candidates ==\nThe presidential elections were held after a decade of military rule, where the 6th president, Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq ruled with the Armed Forces as military president and as Chief martial law administrator with authoritarian rule. Zia-ul-Haq would die in a controversial plane crash, which left the presidential office vacant, thus, the powerful Chairman of the Senate, Ghulam Ishaq Khan took over as empowered interim president.\nThe Revival of the Constitutional Order had amended the Constitution, which allowed the president to appoint any member of the National Assembly as prime minister. Ghulam Ishaq Khan appointed Benazir Bhutto as Prime Minister of Pakistan on the condition that she would give full support to him in the December presidential elections.\nA political deal was made between Ghulam Ishaq Khan and Benazir Bhutto. The Pakistan Peoples Party assured that they would vote for Ghulam Ishaq Khan, as Ishaq Khan had appointed Benazir as prime minister. Ghulam Ishaq Khan was also the candidate of Islami Jamhoori Ittehad.\n\n\n== Results ==\n4 candidates took part in the elections, with most of them minor candidates securing low votes from minor and regional parties.\nGhulam Ishaq Khan easily won the elections, due to the support and votes given to him by the 2 largest political groups, the right-wing Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI) and left-wing Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), this support would allow him to secure the highest number of votes  —  608 out of 752.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\nThe election of Ghulam Ishaq Khan as President would extend his already ongoing term. Since he ruled directly after Zia-ul-Haq’s presidency, he would be given high-level presidential powers, as Zia-ul-Haq ruled as an authoritarian president. The powers given to the President of Pakistan in Zia-ul-Haq’s time mainly consisted of the Eighth Amendment, in which the President could dissolve the government whenever he thought need be.\nBenazir Bhutto would be ruling Prime Minister at the time of Ghulam Ishaq Khan’s presidency. She would be highly anti-Zia-ul-Haq and attempted to reverse his policies, mainly the Eighth Amendment. As Benazir was the Prime Minister, she wanted more power for the Prime Minister, and less for the President. These desires of Benazir Bhutto would consequently lead to a conflict with Ghulam Ishaq Khan, who would dissolve Benazir’s government, as she attempted to strip the Presidential powers via reversing the Eighth Amendment.\nGhulam Ishaq Khan would rule the country for more than 4 years, following the election, and would come into conflict with both his former allies, the PPP and IJI, as he dissolved both Benazir Bhutto’s and Nawaz Sharif’s governments over the disputed Eighth Amendment.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Anti-Occupation Bloc (in Hebrew: הגוש נגד הכיבוש, in Arabic: الكتلة ضد الاحتلال) is an Israeli alliance of Jewish and Palestinian political movements, activists and organizations, which argues against Israeli occupation policies. The bloc was formed during the 2020–2021 protests against Benjamin Netanyahu, which argued that rather than simply remove Netanyahu from power, Israeli policies must also be examined and amended.\nThe bloc protested together at the Sheikh Jarrah demonstrations, 2020–2021 protests against Benjamin Netanyahu, and 2023 Israeli judicial reform protests, and as of April 2024 is participating in the 2024 Israeli protests against Benjamin Netanyahu.\nOn their website, the bloc has written: \"We are working together to emphasize the connection between the occupation and the regime revolution [referring to the 2023 Israeli judicial reform]. We are thousands of protesters in over 20 cities across the country\".\n\n\n== Involved groups ==\nThe bloc consists of mainly left and far-left movements and organizations, that felt the need to unite in view of the weakening of the Israeli left.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe bloc formed at 2020–2021 protests against Benjamin Netanyahu.\nOn 14 October 2020, the bloc wrote \"דמוקרטיה או כיבוש\" (\"Democracy or Occupation\") in Rabin Square, where the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin occurred.On 1 July 2023, a Brothers in Arms activist attacked an Anti-Occupation Bloc protestor with pepper spray, causing outrage. On 23 July 2023, members of the bloc hung a sign saying \"We will not die and we will not kill in the service of the settlements\" in front of General Staff Israel Defense Forces Headquarters in Tel Aviv-Yafo.On 16 January 2024, clashes occurred between Israeli Police and the Anti-Occupation Bloc. the police said later that day: \"There is no tolerance for those who support the enemy\".Since 2023, three youth members of Mesarvot and Anti-Occupation Bloc have been sent to prison for refusal to serve in the Israel Defense Forces.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Russian Kh-69 missile (Cyrillic: Х-69) is a reportedly stealthy variant of the Kh-59MK2 missile with a range of 400 km (250 mi). It has a reduced radar signature compared to its forerunners. It is known to be an air-to-surface subsonic cruise missile.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Kh-69 missile is a product of the Tactical Missile Corporation subsidiary MKB Raduga. The missile was first unveiled in August 2022.\nIn September 2023, the International Institute for Strategic Studies reported that the Kh-69 missile was still in the testing phase of development.\nClaims have been made that three Kh-69s were fired at Ukraine overnight on 7-8 February 2024.\nOn 11 April 2024, Ukrainian sources claimed debris of a Kh-69 missile were found on the site of Russian missile attack against Trypilska thermal power plant (TTPP), which was completely disabled as a result of the attack. The attack \"destroyed the transformer, turbines and generators\" of the TTPP. The number of missiles used in the attack was six, and none were disabled by the Ukrainian air defences. The Institute for the Study of War characterized the attack as part of \"continued efforts to improve strike packages and penetrate Ukraine's degraded air defense.\" To avoid Ukrainian air defences, benefit is drawn from the 400km range of the Kh-69 missile, which places all of Ukraine within range of the Russia-Belarus frontier, except Zakarpattia oblast.\n\n\n== Technical characteristics ==\nThe launch platforms of choice are the MiG-31, Su-30MK, Su-34 or Su-35 aircraft. It is expected to be the primary cruise missile for the Su-57, to be stored in its internal weapons bays.\nThe missile is similar in nature to the Storm Shadow and Taurus KEPD 350 missiles. It has one pair of \nwings and four fins at the rear, that all deploy in flight after launch.\nThe missile is reported to weigh under 800kg and is reported to cruise at speeds of up to 1000km/h. It has a warhead weight of approximately 300kg.\nThe Kh-69 is navigated by GLONASS and GPS satellites, with inertial backup. The missile is reportedly able to fly at an altitude as low as 20 meters above ground level, which greatly contributes to its low radar observability. An electro-optical seeker was reported in 2022 to round out the sensor suite.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Carroll Cooley (August 25, 1935 – May 29, 2023) was an American police detective. He was known for arresting laborer Ernesto Miranda. The arrest led to failing to warn a person of their constitutional rights before interrogating them, becoming a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case named Miranda v. Arizona.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nCooley was born in Bald Knob, Arkansas.\nIn 1958, Cooley joined the Phoenix Police Department. Over the next few years, he was promoted to the rank of detective.\nOn March 13, 1963, Cooley and fellow police officer Wilfred Young arrested laborer Ernesto Miranda. The arrest led to failing to warn a person of their constitutional rights before interrogating them, becoming a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case named Miranda v. Arizona, which ruled that criminal suspects must be informed of their right against self-incrimination and their right to consult with an attorney before being questioned by police.\nIn 1978, Cooley retired from the police department. After retiring, he was an adjunct professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.\nCooley died on May 29, 2023, at the age of 87.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCarroll Cooley at IMDb",

        "content": "The Vosgienne is a French cattle breed of medium size well adapted to mountainous regions, primarily found in the Vosges Mountains.\n\n\n== Origin ==\nAccording to Alain Raveneau, it originates from cows that arrived in the massif in the 17th century. It is said to have been imported by Swedish soldiers who devastated the Duchy of Lorraine during the Thirty Years' War and crossbred with the local population. It is believed to have found a terrain in the Vosges similar to Scandinavia and naturally adapted to the granite massif and mountainous climate. Philippe J. Dubois, however, considers this origin more of a legend. According to him, the breed comes from a Jura population, close to the Tourache of Franche-Comté, an ancestor of the Montbéliarde. This ancient population would have been crossbred with Brown and Prim'Holstein breeds. Photos from the late 19th century to the 1960s show animals that were almost entirely black with white heads or piebald, but very few were speckled.\nIn the past, two types coexisted, selected from different geographical areas: in the Bruche valley, cows were small and slender, and in the Munster region, they were more massive. The first type disappeared before 1980. From 1971, an introduction of Telemark bull semen took place in 12% of the population.\n\n\n== Abilities ==\nIt is a dual-purpose breed, with both productions being valued equally without favoring one over the other. Before the advent of mechanized traction, the Vosgienne breed was also used as a draught animal. Its well-balanced milk, rich in useful substances, is highly valued for AOC Munster cheese. While heifers may lack a bit of precocity, this drawback is offset by very good longevity.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe Vosgienne breed, represented by the cow Candy, is the official mascot of the 2011 International Agricultural Show in Paris.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of cattle breeds\n\n\n== References ==",

It hoped to terminate the Czech membership in NATO by writing a letter addressed to the President of the United States Joe Biden, citing Article 13 of the North Atlantic Treaty. Several diplomates commented their efforts as \"ridiculous\" and the Czech Minister of Foreign Affairs Jan Lipavský have reaffirmed the importance of the membership in a reaction to the letter.  \n\n\n== Composition ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Enterococcus casseliflavus is a species of commensal Gram-positive bacteria. Its name derived from the \"flavus\" the Latin word for yellow due to the bright yellow pigment that it produces. This organism can be found in the gastrointestinal tract of humans\nThe most common form of E. casseliflavus infection is bacteremia. A study evaluating cases of E. casseliflavus bacteremia found that malignancy and diabetes mellitus were the most common complications, suggesting that a compromised immune system may be a risk factor for developing E. casseliflavus bacteremia. Several cases of bacteremia have been attributed to prior infection or surgery on the biliary tract and liver, suggesting that E. casseliflavus has a high affiliation for these organs.\nE. casseliflavus has also been reported to cause endophthalmitis.\n\n\n== Description ==\nEnterococcus casseliflavus are facultative Gram-positive cocci. They are catalase negative and produce pyrolidonyl arylamidase. They are able to produce acid from many sugars, including L-Arabinose, gluconate, inulin, mannitol, melibiose, trehatol, and xylitol. Similar to other members of the genus, E. casseliflavus is able to hydrolyze esculin. This organism reacts with Lancefield group D antisera.\nE. casseliflavus shares many phenotypic traits with the more frequently encountered E. faecium. However, additional biochemical tests can be used to separate the two organisms. Additionally, E. casseliflavus produces respiratory quinones and its colonies possess a bright yellow pigment.\nE. casseliflavus possess the vanC genotype and are intrinsically resistant to glycopeptides such as vancomycin.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ohel Yizkor is the central gathering structure and the ceremony hall of the Yad Vashem Holocaust Remembrance Authority in Jerusalem. In the building, the national memorial ceremonies in memory of the Holocaust victims are held, and it is customary for official guests of the State of Israel to visit and lay wreaths in memory of the victims.\n\n\n== Establishment of the Structure ==\nThe Ohel Yizkor structure was designed by architects Aryeh El-Hanani, Aryeh Sharon, and Benjamin Idelson, inspired by the memorial site structure for the massacre in Fosse Ardeatine. The building was constructed in 1957 with the purpose of serving as a ceremony hall for the memorial site.\n\n\n== Description of the Structure ==\nThe structure is square-shaped. Its walls are built of roughly hewn basalt stones of various sizes, brought from the Beit She'an Valley. This is since the construction was in 1961 when the Golan Heights were still in Syrian hands.\nIts roof is made of exposed concrete, whose inner side is pyramid-shaped. The apex of the pyramid is located above the eternal flame burning within the structure. The roof does not touch the building's walls and is supported by thin, almost invisible steel columns, since the building is not illuminated, the only light entering the building comes through the slit between the roof and the building's walls.\nThe building's doors were designed by the sculptor David Plombo (who later designed the Palombo Gates at the entrance to the Knesset building) in the shape of smokestacks. Visitors do not walk on the building's floor but pass along its length on a concrete bridge. Engraved on the floor of the building are the names of concentration and extermination camps in Europe, names of ghettos and killing pits.\nIn total, 22 names of concentration and extermination camps as well as major extermination and murder sites that were prominent in research at that time are marked. For example, the name Breendonk is written following the testimony of Jean Améry that was found. The names of the places are engraved in white lettering reliefs above the black floor, designed by the typographer and calligrapher Yerachmiel Schechter. Beneath the black marble stone in the center of the hall, ashes brought from extermination and concentration camps are buried. The ashes were buried outside, on the mountain slopes, in the fifties, and in 1961 were transferred to Ohel Yizkor with its inauguration. With the inauguration of the tent, the Military Rabbinate buried it, since 'the Chief Rabbinate was working with the Holocaust cellar and was not in contact on this matter with Yad Vashem in those years.'\n\n\n=== Names of the Places in Ohel Yizkor ===\nThe names of the places in Ohel Yizkor, as they are written in the transliteration that was customary in the sixties:\n\nTotal – 22 names. The structure is built in the shape of a pyramid to symbolize eternal remembrance, and the structure is also meant to recall the Tent of Meeting (hence its name: Ohel Yizkor).\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nEyal Meron, Jerusalem and All Its Paths, Yad Ben Zvi Publishing, 1996.\nDavid Kroyanker, Jerusalem - An Architectural Look, Keter Publishing House, 1996\nDoron Bar, Yad Vashem: The Challenge of Shaping a Holocaust Remembrance Site, 1942–1976, De Gruyter Oldenbourg 2021\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHall of Remembrance on the Yad Vashem website (No. 13 on the map).\nMichael Yaacovson: Architectural and Historical Review Accompanied by Photos on 'Rear Window' blog, July 18, 2012\nHall of Remembrance on the website of the sculptor Kosso Eloul, who designed parts of it\nOn Hall of Remembrance at Yad Vashem as a symbol of Holocaust remembrance, an introductory video by Prof. Doron Bar\nMichael Yaacovson: A Tour in the Hall of Remembrance at Yad Vashem, on 'Rear Window' blog, February 29, 2024",

        "content": "The National Hauszmann Program (Hungarian: Nemzeti Hauszmann terv) is a national renovation plan for the Buda Castle district in Budapest, Hungary, which aims to rebuild or restore a number of buildings, gardens and parks to their former glory. These structures were damaged or destroyed in World War II during the battle of Budapest that took place between December 1944 and February 1945, and were not rebuilt or renovated by the government of the then-Hungarian People's Republic for idealistic reasons. The project is named after Alajos Hauszmann, the castle's last major architect. The renovation project will last from 2019 to 2030.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Hungarian Government formulated the \"National Hauszmann Program\" to revitalize and restore Buda Castle and its surrounding district in the period of 2019−2030. The program is named in honour of the Austro-Hungarian architect Alajos Hauszmann, who was himself the architectural director of the expansion work on the Royal Castle for a decade and a half and gave it its current neo-Baroque appearance. The first phase of the program started in 2016. By 2019, the reconstruction of the Royal Riding Hall, Stöckl Staircase and the Castle Guards' Barrack had been completed and the rebuilding of the Ybl Slope next to the barrack started. In the same year, further reconstructions were announced, namely Archduke Joseph's Palace, the former Headquarters of the Ministry of Defense, and the former Ministry of Foreign Affairs' building.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe program includes, for example:\nReconstruction of the Royal Riding Hall of Hungary, Castle Guards' Barracks, Stöckl Staircase, Archduke Joseph's Palace, St Stephen's Room in the Royal Palace, and former Red Cross Headquarters;\nReconstruction of the Ministry of Defense of Hungary and Tower of the National Archives of Hungary;\nRenovation of the Fehérvári Rondella and the surrounding gardens;\nRestoration of the Equestrian Statue of Artúr Görgey and the Matthias Fountain.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNational Hauszmann Program website",

        "content": "The Ninth Avenue Historic District is a National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) listed historic district located along and around Ninth Avenue in the Cliff/Cannon neighborhood of Spokane, Washington. It stretches from Monroe Street on the east to Chestnut Street on the west, running the length of Ninth Avenue and extending to include portions of Eighth, 10th and 11th Avenues, mostly in the western half of the district.\nA residential area, the district was built to house many of early-Spokane's elite residents in grand Queen Anne, Colonial Revival, Classical Revival, American Foursquare and Tudor Revival homes, along with numerous Bungalow homes for middle-class residents. The area was developed largely between 1892 and 1940, with limited modern incursions in the form of apartments having been built in the decades since. It retains its residential character to this day, though many of the large single-family homes have been converted into multi-unit dwellings.\nLocated roughly one mile from the heart of Downtown Spokane, the Ninth Avenue Historic District is an example of an early residential development in Spokane, free of commercial incursions. Notable architects including Kirtland Cutter, Willis Ritchie, Julius Zittel, Loren L. Rand, John K. Dow and Albert Held designed homes in the district.\nIn the present day, the area is part of the Cliff/Cannon neighborhood of Spokane, stretching from the historic Cannon's Addition in the west over to Monroe Street, a major arterial extending from the north side of Spokane through downtown and up onto the South Hill, in the east. It makes up part of what is now known as the \"lower South Hill\" for its location near the bottom of a hill which rises abruptly from the downtown area to the north. The terrain surrounding the Ninth Avenue Historic District falls off dramatically on the west to a valley containing Latah Creek, which marks a natural western boundary, and drops to the north to the valley of the Spokane River and Downtown Spokane in the north, while terrain rises to the west and south as one continues up into the South Hill residential area of Spokane.\n\n\n== Setting ==\nThe Ninth Avenue Historic District is located, as the name implies, mostly along Ninth Avenue in the Cliff/Cannon neighborhood on Spokane's South Hill. It stretches from Monroe Street on the east, an arterial which connects the district with residential areas to the south of the district, to Downtown and the north side of the city beyond, to Chestnut Street on the east where the South Hill falls off dramatically into the valley cut by Latah Creek and the Latah/Hangman neighborhood. The district also includes portions of Eighth Avenue between Monroe and Cedar Streets in the east and along Eighth Avenue between Elm and Chestnut Streets in the west, 10th Avenue between Cherry and Cannon Streets in the east, and 11th Avenue between Maple and Elm Streets in the east. Aside from Monroe Street on the west and the couplet of Maple and Walnut Streets in the middle of the district, which are each major north–south thoroughfares, the roads in the district can be described as residential side-streets.The terrain within the district is mostly flat, though it trends higher as one heads east, but the surrounding terrain is considerably more varied. Immediately north of the district the elevation falls rapidly into the valley of the Spokane River and Downtown Spokane while the western edge of the district lies along a nearly 200 foot drop down to the valley of Latah Creek. Terrain gradually rises to the south and east, with a more dramatic rise in the east occurring just outside of the district beyond Monroe Street.\nPlatted on a grid layout, streets in the district are almost entirely uniform in a north–south and east–west manner, though this grid breaks down just beyond the fringes of the district to the west and east as the terrain changes. It is well connected to neighboring parts of Spokane including downtown to the north and the rest of Cliff/Cannon and the South Hill to the south.The Ninth Avenue Historic District boasts a strong tree canopy of both planted deciduous street trees lining many of the area roads as well as trees planted or developed around on private property. Many properties contain vestige ponderosa pine or Douglas fir trees native to the area. The basalt rock outcroppings around which these trees once grew have largely been built over in the district, though vestiges of the rock's presence can be seen as a building material in many of the homes and on outcroppings in adjacent areas.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area that is now the Ninth Avenue Historic District was inhabited by the Spokane people for centuries prior to American settlement.A.M. Cannon, an early settler and developer in the Spokane area who arrived in 1878, platted the area west of Cedar Street to 10th Avenue in 1883. A decade later, during the Panic of 1893, Cannon lost all of his holdings, though his name remains prominent as it is in the official city neighborhood of Cliff/Cannon and on Cannon Street in the west of the district.Most of the construction in the district took place in the years between Cannon's plat in 1883 and 1920, with the most intense development occurring during the first decade of the 20th century. Spokane's population grew from roughly 30,000 people in 1900 to over 100,000 in 1910. It was during this decade that the city expanded from its original settlement location in what is now Downtown Spokane about a mile to the northeast of the district through Ninth Avenue and up the South Hill. Development in the area was spurred by the establishment of streetcar trolley lines which provided transportation into the city center.Development of residential areas for the elites of Spokane had been limited largely to the Browne's Addition neighborhood in the city's formative decades of the late 1800s, but by the turn of the century new development was needed to match the pace of population growth. Ninth Avenue, along with other historic districts like the adjacent Marycliff-Cliff Park Historic District and the Corbin Park Historic District on the north side of town, was a beneficiary of this boom. Numerous notable local architects including Loren L. Rand, Willis A. Ritchie, Cutter and Malmgren, Albert Held, John K. Dow, and Julius Zittel worked to design homes in the district.Most of the grandest homes were built between 1905 and 1915 and housed some of Spokane's elite, including Mayor James Comstock, financier Alfred Coolidge, and businessman John Sengfelder — whose homes are each also listed on the Spokane Register of Historic Places. Another resident of the district, J. Grier Long, hosted then-President Theodore Roosevelt during a visit to Spokane in 1908. In addition to the wealthy elite of Spokane, the neighborhood housed numerous craftsmen and teachers, creating a varied socio-economic environment which persists to this day.\nIn the decades since the neighborhood's complete development, which ended in the early 1920s, there have been some changes to the historic district. Spokane's streetcar system was replaced with busses in 1936, though disused rails are still visible in some roads around the district. Many of the formerly single-family homes have been converted into multi-unit dwellings, and some homes have been demolished to make way for modern apartments or condominiums. In addition to being listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994, portions of the district were listed on the local Spokane Register of Historic Places in 2023 as the Cannon Hill Streetcar Historic District.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nCliff/Cannon, Spokane\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Spokane County, Washington\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Diario de Córdoba was a Spanish newspaper published in the city of Córdoba between 1849 and 1938. Founded in the mid-19th century, throughout its history the newspaper established itself as one of the main publications in the capital of Córdoba. It became the dean of the Cordoban press and continued to be published well into the Spanish Civil War.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was founded in 1849 by the businessman and printer Fausto García Tena, originally born as Diario de Córdoba of commerce, industry, administration, news and notices. After the death of the founder, in 1874 the newspaper was managed by his sons: Ignacio, Manuel, Rafael and Fausto. At the end of the 19th century Rafael García Lovera was still in charge of the newspaper. After his death the ownership of the newspaper passed into the hands of his widow, Araceli Osuna Pineda.\nIn its early years it coexisted with another prominent local newspaper, La Crónica de Córdoba.\nFrom its inception it was a publication with an independent and moderate editorial line, although it later moved towards more conservative positions. It stayed away from political disputes, focusing more on issues related to the development of Córdoba and its province. It would again adopt an independent stance after Ricardo de Montis became editor of the newspaper in 1929. Despite the relevance it achieved at provincial level, it would never reach the circulation and relevance of the main newspapers of the time, nor did it always enjoy a healthy economy. In this sense, the newspaper always had a modest circulation and would never exceed 3,000 copies.\nAt the time of the Second Republic, the newspaper came to be considered the \"dean\" of the Andalusian press, as by then it was the longest-lived newspaper that was still active. A reflection of its social prestige was the fact that since 1930 the newspaper had a street named after it.\nThe Diario de Córdoba continued to be published after the outbreak of the Civil War, but the Press Law of 1938 established requirements that newspapers such as the Cordovan daily could not assume, so it ended up disappearing that same year. Its last issue appeared on 30 September 1938.\nAmong the directors, editors and contributors were Ignacio García Lovera, Manuel García Lovera, Ricardo de Montis, Marcelino Durán de Velilla —the last director of the newspaper between 1936 and 1938—, Carolina de Soto y Corro,  Manuel Villalba y Burgos, José Osuna Pineda, Rafael Osuna Pineda, Francisco Arévalo, Antonio Arévalo, Manuel García Prieto, Rosario Vázquez, Olimpia Cobos Losúa, Eugenio García Nielfa, Francisco Azorín, etc.\n\n\n== Archive ==\nThe Municipal Library of Cordoba has microfilmed issues from 1854 - five years after its foundation - to 1938, although there are numerous gaps referring to specific issues and whole years. There are also series of copies conserved in the State Public Library in Cordoba, in the Municipal Archives of Cordoba and in the collections of the University of Cordoba.\nGarci Fernandez agreed to call himself Count of Castañeda, which possession was taken by his wife Doña Aldonza, who was the daughter of D. Juan, Lord of Aguilar, and granddaughter of Count D. Tello.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAlcalá Ortiz, Enrique (2004).

        "content": "Bandits of Kutch (Urdu: کچے کے ڈاکو) is a criminal gang active in the riverine belt of Sindh and Punjab, Pakistan. They are known for their violent activities, including kidnapping, extortion and murder. They have turned their operations into various illegal activities and are known to cheat people on the pretext of love or business. Despite several large-scale operations against them, they continue to operate in the southern districts, posing a significant challenge to local authorities. The bandits are reportedly armed with more sophisticated weapons than the local police and have targeted many civilians. Their activities have instilled fear in the local population, and their influence seems to be growing. The Sindh government is actively working to stop their activities, but the former interior minister of Sindh says that unless action is taken against the landowners in Kutch, the dacoits will not be eradicated.\n\n\n== Criminal activities ==\nBandits are notorious for their brutal tactics. They kidnap civilians and security personnel, make videos of physical violence, and demand millions of rupees in ransom. In cases where the ransom is not paid, the hostages are brutally killed. Bandits are no longer just involved in bandits but ow they have turned their operations into various illegal activities. They are also known to deceive people by pretending to be in love or business.\nGhotki robber Faqir Nisar Shar regularly comes on Facebook to threaten the police and support his Shar community and dacoits. Shar is considered to be the spokesperson of dacoits. Along with them, the gangsters are not only using social media for their activities, but in some videos, they also display weapons with the dubbing of Sindhi and Saraiki songs, which are shared on social media.\nThe bandits have targeted many citizens. Despite several large-scale operations against them, they continue to operate in the southern districts.\nThe HRCP's fact-finding report stated that the bandits receive a ransom of one billion rupees annually. During 2022, 300 people were kidnapped by the bandits for ransom.\n\n\n== Weaponry ==\nThe bandits are reportedly armed with sophisticated weapons including mortars, rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) and anti-aircraft guns. Their weapons are said to be superior to local police, posing a significant challenge to law enforcement agencies.\n\n\n== Timeline ==\nIn November 2022, five policemen including DSP Abdul Malik Bhutto, SHO Abdul Malik Kamangar, SHO Deen Mohammad Laghari and two police constables were martyred in an attack by dacoits.\nIn May 2023, two persons were abducted by these dacoits in Ghotki.\nIn March 2024, a primary teacher, Allah Rakhiyo Nandwani, who raised his voice against Kachhe dacoits in Kashmore Kundhkot district of Sindh province, was allegedly killed by Kachhe dacoits.\n\n\n== Challenges and countermeasures ==\nBandits continue to be a major challenge for local authorities, despite several crackdowns against them. Their activities have instilled fear in the local population, and their influence seems to be growing. The government has been criticized for failing to deal effectively with the threat.\nThe Sindh government is actively working to stop the activities of these dacoits. In April 2024, however, the former interior minister of Sindh says that unless action is taken against the landlords in Kutch, the dacoits will not be eradicated.\nIn April 2024, the Federal Ministry of Interior, under the leadership of Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, decided to conduct a joint operation in the Kacha area after detailed consultations and deliberations to strengthen security measures across Pakistan and deal with criminal elements. This decision was taken during a high-level meeting of the National Action Plan implementation review committee. Advanced technology, including drones, will be used to increase operational efficiency.\n\n\n== See Also ==\nKacha Operation\nOperation Shikarpur\n\n\n== References ==",

The clashes took place between troops of the East Pakistan Rifles (EPR) and the Indian Army in Lakhsmipur.\nThe Clashes began on 7 August 1958, after Major Tufail Mohammad ordered three quick response teams to launch an attack on the Indian troops who infiltrated and occupied Lakhsmipur in 1957.\n\n\n== The clash ==\nOn 7 August 1958, Major Tufail Mohammad ordered to close in on the Indian soldiers from all three sides. Soldiers started to crawl their way towards the Indian troops in an attempt to make them withdraw. Though they were able to reach close to the Indian troops, as the fight started, the soldiers had serious wounds and casualties, as they were vulnerable to the Indian firing.\nMajor Tufail Mohammad was wounded after he threw a grenade on the Indian post killing Indian soldiers, later on, Wounded Tufail engaged in a close quarters battle with Indian troops, eventually eliminating them by throwing grenades and engaging a firefight with Indian troops and Machine gunners and destroying Indian outposts and making Indian troops retreat. He later succumbed to his wounds, and before he died, he said his last words to his Junior officer: \"I have completed my duty, the enemy is on the run.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Poh Yuan Nie (born 21 December 1965; 傅媛聂 Fù Yuánnìe), alias Pony Poh or Owen Fu, is a Singaporean fugitive listed on Interpol's international Red Notice list. Poh, the former principal of a tuition centre in Singapore, was charged and convicted of masterminding and abetting several students to cheat in their O-level examinations in 2016. Poh had committed the crime with her niece and two other tutors, all of whom were charged and put on trial for their respective roles in the case. Poh was found guilty and sentenced to four years in prison for the sophisticated cheating scheme, while Poh's remaining accomplices were jailed between two and three years for the crime, and Poh herself lost her appeal against the conviction and sentence. Poh, who was granted bail after sentencing, did not adhere to a court order to surrender in September 2022 to serve her jail term, and was suspected to have fled Singapore. An Interpol red notice was issued for her arrest, and presently, as of 2024, Poh remains at large.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nPoh Yuan Nie was born in Singapore on 21 December 1965. Little is known about her childhood and education, except that she became a tuition teacher at one point after reaching adulthood and completing her education, and in her family, Poh had one niece Fiona Poh Min (傅敏 Fù Mǐn), who was born in 1987. By 2016, Poh became the principal of a private tuition centre, Zeus Education Centre, which is currently defunct and formerly located in Tampines.\nPoh, who identified herself as a lesbian, entered a relationship with a 17-year-old student Tan Jia Yan (陈家燕 Chén Jiāyàn), who all the while mistook Poh for a man. Poh maintained this relationship with Tan for seven years before they broke up in 2008, when Tan, who was months shy of graduating from university, discovered Poh two-timing with another female. Tan later became a permanent teacher at Poh's tuition centre, where she continued to look up to Poh as a mentor despite their break-up. Poh later date another tuition teacher named Wong Mee Keow, who was the owner of another private tuition agency, where Poh used to work at before she eventually became the principal of Zeus, and they remained intimate until Poh's arrest in 2016 for conspiracy to help her students cheat in their national examinations.\nIn 2006, Poh was a suspect behind an alleged scam, where it involved Poh and two female Chinese agents arranging for two students from China being enrolled into a local secondary school after bypassing their entrance examinations, and when this was discovered, the police sought Poh's assistance for investigations but she could not be located, and Wong also denied twice that she knew Poh during police questioning in August and November 2006. The police investigations thus came to a standstill due to them unable to locate Poh for questioning, but the investigations were subsequently revived in 2015 and 2016.\n\n\n== Criminal conduct ==\nBetween 19 and 24 October 2016, Poh Yuan Nie and three of the teachers - Poh's niece Fiona Poh, Poh's former girlfriend Tan Jia Yan and a Chinese national Feng Riwen (冯日文 Féng Rìwén) - conspired to help six Chinese students to cheat in their O-level examinations.\nPrior to this scheme, a Chinese national Dong Xin approached Zeus Education Centre, asking Poh to provide tuition for six students from China and help them to pass the O-levels and enter local polytechnics. Dong had paid Poh a deposit of S$8,000 and an admission fee of S$1,000 per student, but the catch was, if the students failed, the money was to be fully refunded. After signing the contracts, Poh thus hatched a plan to help the six students cheat in their O-levels, and she oversaw the whole operation, in which Fiona, Feng and Tan were roped to help her carry out the plan, which was set to take place from 19 to 24 October. Additionally, Tan was reportedly paid S$3,000 every month, on top of $1,000 per student for providing them with lodgings.\nA few hours before each examination, under Poh's directions, Tan, Fiona Poh and Feng provided the six Chinese students wearable Bluetooth devices, which were attached onto their bodies, and the students also put on a skin-coloured in-ear earphone before going into the exam centres, where they would take the paper as private candidates. The devices were also connected to the mobile phones that were concealed under the clothing of each student, who were told to wear thick clothes to better hide the phones.\nAdditionally, Tan and Fiona would register themselves as private candidates as well, and either of them sat for an exam paper with a phone concealed and attached to their chests. Tan or Fiona would use the video-calling application FaceTime to capture images of the exam paper for the remaining accomplices to see and work out the answers. Through individual phone calls, the answers were relayed to the students, who penned down the answers. Also, the students were told to cough if they cannot hear the answer clearly and the answer would be repeated back to them.\nThe six students were able to hide their tracks and complete three papers from 19 to 21 October, but on 24 October, the plan was exposed when an invigilator heard unusual electronic transmission sounds and voices coming from one of the six students during an English exam. The student was later summoned to the office, where he handed over his earphone and devices, and confessed to his participation in a cheating scheme devised by Poh. The reason behind the sounds was due to the malfunctioning of the student's earpiece when one of the tutors, Feng, called him in midst of his paper.\nAfter the student came clean with the scheme, the police were contacted and subsequently, Poh and her associates were arrested and charged with multiple counts of cheating. They were also charged with obstructing the course of justice for allegedly trying to send one of the students back to China to avoid him from testifying against them. Wong Mee Keow, Poh's lover, was also implicated in the case since she tried to lie about her relationship with Poh and delete her photos during the investigation of the O-level cheating case, and her cover-up back in 2006 was also discovered by the police.\n\n\n== Court proceedings ==\n\n\n=== Conviction of Tan and Wong ===\nOn 16 April 2018, 31-year-old Tan Jia Yan was the first and to date, the sole member of the offenders to plead guilty to 27 charges of cheating. Tan's sentencing trial took place a year later on 15 April 2019, and she was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. In sentencing Tan, District Judge Kenneth Yap described the offences as one of undermining \"the principle of meritocracy and Singapore’s reputation as an education hub.\" He accepted the prosecution's arguments that a sentence of three years was warranted rather than the defence's proposed 18-month jail term since the cheating scheme was an affront to the efforts of thousands of students who shed their blood, sweat and tears to excel in the O-levels and opposed their rights to equality and fairness, and it also gave the wrong impression that the rich could use money to buy exam results without going through the necessitated process to complete the papers. The prosecution also stated earlier in their submissions that the case showed a need for deterrence and demonstrate the outrage of the community, due to its damage over Singapore's reputation as an education hub and the international and local attention paid to this case.\nAs for 39-year-old Wong Mee Keow, who was not involved in the crime but had provided false information to police to shield her girlfriend during their investigations of Poh (both in 2006 and 2016), she was imposed a fine of S$2,000 after being convicted of charges of providing fake information to the police.\n\n\n=== Poh Yuan Nie's trial ===\nPoh Yuan Nie, together with her niece and Feng Riwen, officially stood trial together at a district court on 17 April 2018 for 27 cheating charges against the each of them. Peter Keith Fernando represented Poh, Peter Ong Lip Cheng represented Fiona and James Chai represented Feng. The prosecution was led by Deputy Public Prosecutors Vadivalagan Shanmuga and Cheng Yuxi, while the trial was presided over by District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt. The trio reportedly pleaded not guilty to the charges.\nThe six students were among the 21 witnesses summoned by the prosecution. The first was Chen Xiang, who testified that on the eve of his first exam, he and the other five Chinese students were told to come to the tuition centre early next morning to meet Poh, and when he did so, he only got wind of the cheating plot and was also provided with the devices on the same morning itself. Chen, who was 19 when he came to court, stated that he agreed to go along, mainly because his family had spent a lot to send him to Singapore and was also assured that he would not be caught red-handed. Chen stated he tried to call another student Chen Yi, who was the same student caught cheating at Tampines Secondary School, on 24 October but could not get through him, and subsequently gotten wind of Chen Yi being caught. Not only did Poh converted some money to 1,000 Chinese yuan for Chen Xiang, Tan booked him on a flight back to China. 17-year-old Zhou Zice, the second of six students to testify in court, testified that via the same means, he was given the answers during the science practical exam on 19 October, in spite of his poor grasp of English and his uncertainty of correctly transcribing the answers he received, and he confirmed that he was told to wear a jacket and thick clothing to hide the Bluetooth devices he had. Zhou, who first came to Singapore in 2015 with the hope of attending an International Baccalaureate (IB) course, revealed that he submitted a decoy phone before the exam, and afterwards carried out the plan with the help of tutors from Zeus, where he was referred to for lessons under recommendation of his Singapore-based guardian.\n21-year-old Zhang Jinlu, who lived with his aunt in Singapore, stated that he first came to Zeus for English lessons after his aunt sent him to go there. He similarly testified about the scheme, and he said he was too scared and did not dare to speak up and voice his intention to not cheat. Zhang said that after having cheated for two days in a row, he was overcame by his conscience and never went to Zeus again after his aunt, who heard about the scheme and did not initially stop him to cheat, agreed to speak to his parents in China and decided to inform Zeus they wished to terminate Zhang's lessons there. Wang Fangfei, then 19, was the fourth to show up in court as a witness and she said that after her English exam on 24 October, the same date when Chen Yi was caught, she was directed by a female teacher of Zeus to delete all her phone conversations regarding the cheating plot, and Wang was also told to abort continuing to use the devices in a second phone call on the following day when she completed her Additional Mathematics exam, and in a third and final phone call, Wang was instructed to not sit for subsequent exams.\nThe fifth student Chen Yi, who was the student caught for cheating, also stated that after he informed Zeus that he had been caught, he was arranged to fly back to China to avoid being arrested by the police. 20-year-old Chen also stated that one of the defendants asked for his password so that she could remotely remove all the phone conversations from Singapore. The final student to take the stand was 20-year-old Xiao Junze, who gave a similar account like the others about the plot. The three invigilators, Stephens Gloria, Benin Sabu and Chiew Chan Ping, were also summoned as prosecution witnesses. Gloria was the one who caught Chen Yi cheating, and the remaining two, Benin and Chiew, were in the office when Chen Yi surrendered his devices and confessed to cheating with Poh's abetment. Tan, who was still in prison serving her jail term after pleading guilty, also appeared as a witness, even though the defence counsel of Poh tried to raise doubts over the validity of her evidence against Poh.\nDuring the trial itself, Fiona Poh alleged that she did not give her statements voluntarily. She claimed that after her brother informed her that their mother was in custody, she went to the police station and was questioned by the investigating officer Stanley Chew, who allegedly banged the table and threatened Fiona to fess up, claiming that Fiona's mother was in the station for ten hours without food or water and even brought up the elderly woman's blood pressure. Also, Fiona even claimed that other officers either coerced her with threats or promises of leniency, but her claims were refuted by the police officers, who stated that no such incidents happened. Denying that she did so to destroy evidence, Fiona told the court that she disposed of her phone because it contained photos of an illegal pet, which was a pangolin, that she reared in the tuition centre, which had since gone defunct during the course of the trial. However, the district court ultimately found that there was a case for Fiona to answer, and the trio were called to give their defence at the close of the prosecution's case, but all the three accused elected to remain silent. The prosecution therefore urged the trial court to draw an adverse inference from the trio's choice to remain silent and saw it fit to determine their guilt.\n\n\n=== Poh's conviction and sentence ===\nOn 7 July 2020, after a 20-day trial that dragged on for 18 months, District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt delivered his verdict. Having made due consideration in this case, District Judge Chay noted that the trio had chosen to remain silent when their defence were called, and hence he was legally bound to draw an adverse inference from their decision to remain silent. District Judge Chay stated that the prosecution's case went unrebutted due to the defendants remaining silent, and hence he found that the prosecution had proven their case beyond a reasonable doubt, and found each member of the trio accused guilty of all 27 counts of cheating. Although the three accused were allowed to remain out on bail (since their arrest), he sentencing trial of the trio was scheduled to take place on 21 August 2020, but it was later postponed.\nOn 16 September 2020, the sentencing verdict was issued for Poh and her two co-accused. 54-year-old Poh, being the mastermind of the scheme, was sentenced to four years in prison; 33-year-old Fiona was sentenced to three years' imprisonment; and 28-year-old Feng was sentenced to jail for two years and four months (equivalent to 28 months). In his sentencing remarks, District Judge Chay admonished the trio for having \"scandalised\" the education system of Singapore and causing great damage to the reputation of Singapore on a national level, and he thus sided with the prosecution and imposed the exact sentences sought by the prosecution for both Feng and Fiona, although the jail term he handed to Poh was four months short of the 52 months proposed by the prosecution.\nAt the time of sentencing, both Feng and Fiona had one pending charge of perverting the course of justice preferred against them, while Poh had another 11 charges pending in her case, including cheating, obstructing justice and failing to report a change in residence. A month later, Feng was spared from the charge of hindering justice after the prosecution applied for Feng to receive an official discharge amounting to an acquittal, which meant that Feng would not again be charged with the same offence.\n\n\n== Appeal process ==\nAfter their sentencing, Fiona Poh and Poh Yuan Nie, who both remained out on bail, appealed to the High Court against their conviction and sentence. On 18 October 2021, the High Court delivered an oral judgement and rejected the appeal of the Pohs, who later brought their case forward to the Court of Appeal, the highest court of the nation, although Poh Yuan Nie absconded while out on bail two months before the Court of Appeal made their final decision over her appeal.\nOn 21 November 2022, the Court of Appeal dismissed the final appeal of both Poh and Fiona. The three judges – Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon and two Judges of Appeal Judith Prakash and Steven Chong – stated that the prosecution did not necessarily need to prove that the convict intended to cause anyone to wrongfully lose or gain property in cases where the offender dishonestly concealed some facts for the sake of deception. The three judges also scrutinized four possible interpretations of the current law on cheating, and they accepted that the word “dishonest” describes the mental state of the accused when committing a cheating offence, and the crime itself was not restricted solely to cases where an offender intended to commit deception related to property. Hence, the Court of Appeal upheld the convictions and sentences of the duo, and rejected their appeals.\nIn the aftermath, in February 2023, Fiona was granted an acquittal for her final preliminary charge of perverting the course of justice, and instead, she was let off with a stern warning from the Attorney-General's Chambers. Fiona, along with Feng Riwen and Tan Jia Yan, were still incarcerated as of 2024.\n\n\n== Disappearance and Interpol red notice ==\nBefore the outcome of her appeal, Poh Yuan Nie was issued a court order to surrender herself in September 2022 to begin her four-year sentence. However, Poh failed to appear in court to surrender herself, and it was thus suspected that Poh had absconded.\nOn 23 November 2022, merely a day after the dismissal of her appeal, a warrant of arrest was issued for Poh, who was still missing. Poh's lawyer Peter Keith Fernando discharged himself on the same day when the warrant of arrest was issued. Investigations revealed that Poh had most likely fled Singapore, and hence in December 2022, the prosecution sought a warrant of arrest outside Singapore's jurisdiction in order to apprehend Poh. The authorities also confirmed that they would apply to Interpol for a red notice against Poh.\nOn 26 January 2023, Interpol officially issued a red notice for Poh's arrest, and the Singapore Police Force also publicly appealed for any crucial information to assist them in tracing her whereabouts. The police also warned the public that anyone caught harbouring Poh would also face the full brunt of the law; the maximum punishment for harbouring a fugitive was five years' imprisonment and a fine under Singapore law.\nAs of 2024, Poh Yuan Nie remains on the run and she is still wanted by both Interpol and the Singaporean police. Her current whereabouts are not known.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of major crimes in Singapore\nList of fugitives from justice who disappeared\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Am(i)na Mahmoud Al-Jaidah (1913 – 2000) was the first woman teacher in Qatar. She opened the first school for girls in Qatar becoming the first woman to lead a school in 1953. She is a key figure in developing Education in Qatar for girls.\n\n\n== Life ==\nMahmoud was born in 1913. Her mother was Nayela Bint Mohamed Darwish and her father was Mahmoud Youssef Al-Jaydah and he dived for and then sold pearls. They were strict Muslims and her mother taught her the Quran. Her father encouraged her to stufy as he believed that boys and girls required a good education. When she was seven she began the task of memorising chapters of the Quran at a school run by Sheikh Hamid Bin Ahmed Bin Mohamed. She was taught by a woman named Mariam and her commitment grew. The children would learn for four hours in the morning and then after going home for lunch, a prayer and a siesta. They returned to the kuttab twice more each day and in three years she learnt the Quran. This was unusual for a female of any age to be a Hafiz.\nMahmoud began teaching when she was fourteen because she had done so well in learning the Quran. She taught women who were older than her including her sister and her aunt. The students had to come her home to be taught because it was forbidden for girls to go to another house without an escort.\nFor four years from the age of eighteen she was a wife in Bahrain. Her husband was related to her father and she had two children before she returned. She had not taught in Bahrain but it is likely that she saw that Bahrain had schools for girls. She had to persuade her sister, who was still teaching, that she could help again at the kuttab. In 1938 when she was about 25 she moved the school to a nearby building as her reputation grew. Her kuttab accepted both boys and girls in the summer and in the winter. They would have study sessions twice a day for five days each week with a very early session before sunrise on Fridays. Initially the students would be divided by gender with boys on one side of the room and girls on the other but in time they attended on different days. The parents of girls had to be persuaded that education was of value and even then some only wanted their girls to read the Quran but saw no value in them being able to write. It was not easy to be a woman and a scholar and she was admired for breaking down predjudice. Qatar was behind the curve led by Kuwait and Bahrain for improving Arab education. In 1951 Qatar opened the Khalid Bin El Walid Boys School.\nHer school became known as Amna Mahmoud's school and she began to teach not only the Quran but also how to read and write. The popularity of the school grew. The Minister of Education tried to raise the question of whether there could be a school for girls. Quran's ruler would not permit it. It is said that the ruler was more pliable after hearing others talking about the good work at Amna Mahmoud's School. Religious advice was taken and it was decided that girls could be educated. \nIn 1953, Amna Mahmoud's school came under the direction of the Qatari Ministry of Education. It was the first school for girls and Amna Mahmoud was the first woman teacher paid by the state. She still had to travel slowly and her house was converted into a school and her male students were transferred to the boy's school. Some parents withdrew their daughters but many other joined and another building had to be included. Two more women teachers were employed for what was named the Banat El Doha School (Daughters of Doha School) and Mahmoud was the country's first woman Principal. This gave Mahmoud personal challenges as the school was offering access to a better education than she had ever enjoyed. She had to study privately so she could keep up with the student's ambitions.\nMore schools were created for girls and initially Mahmoud was the principal of a few of them. Many of her students became teachers and in the 1970s her school gained a library. She retired in 1976.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nShe died in the year 2000. The building where she established her school, now named Umm Almo'mneen school, was closed in 2005. It became an arts centre. In 2019 it was re-opened as a design studio preserving architecture from when it was a school. Qatar Museums curate a small collection of objects from her school.\nThe Amina Mahmoud Al Jaida Primary Girls school in Doha is named for her. In 2018 the artist Iman al Saad staged an exhibition called \"Words of Gold\" using works from the Quran. Iman al Saad dedicated all the profits from the exhibition to charity as she had been inspired by her mother Amna Mahmoud Al-Jaidah.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHer biography",

        "content": "Nighat Arif (born 9 February 1984) is a broadcaster from Chesham. Born in Village 38 in Punjab, Pakistan, she moved to the UK aged nine, and became a doctor to stave off an arranged marriage, taking a post at a practice in Chesham. She began making appearances on television in May 2019 while on maternity leave, and later became the resident doctor for BBC Breakfast and ITV's This Morning and made four appearances in Countdown's Dictionary Corner in April 2024; her TikTok account had nearly half a million followers in August 2023. She published a medical guide, The Knowledge, in 2023.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nArif was born on 9 February 1984 in Punjab, Pakistan in Village 38, on the grounds that when British colonisers were in her country, they had not bothered to name any of her villages;: 15:00  she moved to the UK aged nine with her mother, and arrived in an April. She speaks Punjabi as a first language,: 14:30  taught herself English by watching EastEnders, and was the first in her family to speak the language. Her father, Arif Hussain, moved to the UK at the end of 1984, was the Imam for Chesham Mosque, and was made a Member of the British Empire in the 2020 New Year Honours; her uncles, cousins, and grandfathers were subsidy farmers.: 15:00  She became a doctor to stave off of an arranged marriage, on the grounds that education was the one pathway her parents would not object to; she became a doctor after her careers' advisor told her that veterinary was the longest such pathway and deciding that animals were not for her.: 15:00  She later took a post as a doctor in Chesham.\n\n\n== Media career ==\nArif first appeared on television in May 2019, when BBC Breakfast dedicated a week of programmes to talking openly about menopause. At the time, Arif was on maternity leave and was breastfeeding, and agreed to appear on the programme after the programme's planning editor gave her an offer of having her makeup done; she then made numerous appearances as that programme's resident GP as well as on ITV's This Morning, and hosted BBC Three Counties Radio's Sunday Breakfast Show. Arif appeared on Countdown in April 2024, making four appearances;: 33:46  while on the programme, she received racist abuse, prompting the production team to verify her wellbeing.In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, Arif began uploading content to her TikTok account, on the grounds that she could disperse information quickly,: 14:48  having been inspired to do so by her patients. When she received her COVID-19 vaccine in January 2021, she uploaded a video to that effect in Urdu; a video of her receiving the vaccine went viral online, and had been viewed by over 100,000 people by March 2021. In August 2023, the Times noted that she \"often subtitles or narrates her posts about female health in Punjabi and Urdu\", languages for which the only words for menopause translate to \"barren\" and \"off the rag\", and later that month the I wrote that she had nearly half a million followers on the platform.\n\n\n== The Knowledge ==\nShe published a book, The Knowledge, in 2023, detailing her knowledge about women's health, with the intention of tackling a number of myths she had encountered; she told the 10 April 2024 edition of Countdown that she was inspired to write it after being told by an older lady in her mosque suffering from symptoms that only \"white women get menopause\". The book makes uses of coloured backgrounds to aid neurodiverse people, a decision inspired by her own dyslexia, and includes content on trans health and LGBT issues and lifelike diagrams of both brown and black bodies; the I suggested in August 2023 that the book contained the first published images of lichen sclerosus on non-white skin, and opined that the book \"blends her no-nonsense, stigma-busting approach with her cultural awareness, her characteristic warmth, and her clinical expertise\" and \"addresses patients as equals, equipping them with the knowledge, tools and advice they need to best manage their reproductive health, without patronising or talking down to them\".\n\n\n== Personal life and views ==\nArif told the 9 April 2024 edition of Countdown that she had been married for 17 years and that her husband, from Village 42, had been introduced to her three years earlier.: 15:00  She has three boys, who were eleven, seven, and three on 1 February 2022. She has been open about her use of localised topical vaginal estrogen; she told the I in November 2023 that she would give it to all women, in order to replace that which is lost over time, and that she would give more women vibrators for medical reasons, on the grounds that orgasms help pelvic floor muscles, lower blood pressure, and release endorphins which help relieve pain and stimulate oxytocin. In March 2024, she was named as one of 28 deputy lieutenants for Buckinghamshire.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Nanikram Dharamdas Mirchandani (1890–1946), was a Sindhi novelist, essayist, and actor-dramatist from British India. He was known for his contributions towards the advancement of Sindhi theatre through the portrayal of social realism. Within the Hyderabad Amateur Dramatic Society in Sindh, he authored full-length and one-act plays which focused on social issues and also played pivotal roles in their productions. He is described as the third prolific Sindhi dramatist and is positioned as a crucial figure facilitating continuity between historical theatrical traditions and contemporary expressions. His plays were presented by the Hyderabad Dramatic Society established in 1910.\nSubsequently, Mirchandani established his own drama club, where his inaugural play, \"Farebi Fitno\" ('Deceitful Brawl'), a rendition of Marie Corelli's \"Vendetta!\", was revived in 1920. His repertoire includes fourteen plays, all of which were successfully staged. He is also known for having adapted Shakespeare's \"Taming of the Shrew\" in Sindhi with the title 'Chata Na Chamat' ('Neither Persuasion nor Punishment', 1922). Among his most notable works are \"Manohar Mohini\" (‘Attractive Enchantress’, 1923), \"Basant Manorma\" (1928), \"Bebaha Moti\" (‘Priceless Pearl’, 1936), and \"Suhini-Mehar\" (‘Suhini and Mehar’, 1946), which were inspired by Sindhi folktales.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Count of Castañeda, ruled by the Counts of Castañeda, a Spanish noble title of late medieval origin, was the first physical territory granted to an aristocrat in the region now occupied by the autonomous community of Cantabria. It initially belonged to the Manrique family. Geographically, it was located in territory originally belonging to the Asturias de Santillana comarca, bordering to the west with the marquisate of Santillana. The nobility title was used for centuries by the eldest sons of the holders of the marquisate of Aguilar de Campoo, first class Grandee of Spain, nowadays, both dignities are separated.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Lords of Castañeda ===\nThe family origins of the Lordship of Castañeda.\n\n1st Lord of Castañeda. Gutiérrez Rodríguez de Asturias (of Santillana). Son of the Duke of Asturias and Count of Oviedo Rodrigo Díaz \"the Asturian\" (so called to differentiate him from his cousin and brother-in-law \"the Castilian\", Rodrigo Díaz, the Cid) and the Infanta Jimena de Carrión, he was the first Lord of Castañeda as he married a lady of the ancient and powerful house of the López de Haro family, who held the Lordship of the Castañeda valley.\n2nd Lord of Castañeda. Muño Gutiérrez of Asturias married to Sancha of Castile, daughter of Alfonso VI.\n3rd Lord of Castañeda. Gómez Muñoz de Castañeda.\n4th Mr. De Castañeda. Diego Gómez de Castañeda married to his aunt, Mayor Álvarez de las Asturias.\n5th Mr. De Castañeda. Pedro Díaz de Castañeda\n6th and last Mr. De Castañeda. Diego Gómez de Castañeda. He sold his rights over the lordship to Alfonso XI, to his son D. Tello, Count of Vizcaya and Aguilar. This is the end of the Castañeda lordship and the creation of the County of Castañeda.\nKing Alfonso XI (1312–1350) granted the lordship, together with the territory of Liébana and Aguilar de Campoo (1339), to one of his bastards, the Infante Don Tello Count of Vizcaya and Aguilar, brother of King Enrique II, his son Juan Téllez who married Leonor de la Vega. To begin with, the marriage between Juan Téllez and Leonor de la Vega united the two most powerful houses of Las Asturias de Santillana (present-day Cantabria). Juan Téllez was the heir of Don Tello, Count of Vizcaya, Lord of Aguilar and Castañeda, legitimised son of Alfonso XI. For her part, Leonor de la Vega, as the only descendant of the House of Vega, was the rich female heir of the Garcilaso family, a lineage that had accumulated a considerable patrimony in the Asturias of Santillana, far beyond its original domain in present-day Torrelavega. A link devised to unify control of the north of Castile. Aldonza Téllez, daughter of Juan Téllez and his wife Leonor de la Vega, the sole heir to her father's possessions, had married Garci Fernández Manrique, so that his consort would end up holding the title of 1st Count of Castañeda.\nKing Henry II of Castile, in the 14th century, confirmed Castañeda to his brother Tello Alfonso, Lord of Biscay. Shortly before his death in 1370, Tello wrote in his will that Castañeda was to go to an illegitimate daughter named María, who had not been raised with him and who later married Juan Hurtado de Mendoza. Henry II, however, annulled the will on 18 February 1371, giving it to Juan Tellez, the first-born son of Tello Alfonso, who also held, among other titles, the title of Marquis of Aguilar de Campoo.\nThrough his descendants came Garci Fernández Manrique married to Aldonza Tellez, of whom it is known that in 1398 he used the titles of \"lord of Aguilar de Campoo\" and \"marquis of Castañeda\", titles that are repeated in the Chronicle of Juan II from 1510. It is possible, therefore, that Garci Fernández Manrique received in 1420 the title of count and perhaps some lands, but not the majority of the county.\nJuan Téllez died in 1385, and soon after his son Juan el Mozo. This was the beginning of some of the problems for Aldonza Téllez, his heir, which became greater when the widow Doña Leonor remarried, just two years after her first husband's death, to Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, Admiral Major of Castile and Mayor of the Merindad de la Asturias de Santillana, who continued the expansion of the territorial domains of medieval Cantabria. Their son, Íñigo López de Mendoza, born in the family home of the De La Vega family in Carrión de los Condes, was granted the title of Marquis of Santillana by King Juan II in 1445, and thirty years later the Catholic Monarchs named his heir, Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, Duke of the Infantado. \nDoña Aldonza and her mother Doña Leonor quarrelled for many years. The former because she wanted to keep what she had inherited from her father, and Doña Leonor because once married to Diego Hurtado de Mendoza she wanted to keep her interests in Liébana, Campoo and the Asturias de Santillana intact, which led to serious conflicts between the two houses, the Manrique Counts of Castañeda and future Marquises of Aguilar and the Mendoza family, future Marquises of Santillana, for the possession of the latter territories.\n\n\n=== Title holders ===\n\n\n==== First Count Garci Fernández Manrique ====\nThe title of Count of Castañeda was granted to Garci IV Fernández Manrique de Lara in 1430, who at the time was chief steward of the Infante Enrique de Trastámara. The county came into being as a privilege of King Ferdinand I of Aragon on the occasion of the marriage of his son Henry, for Garci's service to the latter. The title was challenged by Pero Fernández de Velasco, who claimed that the lands of the new lordship were his. To compensate him, the king promised him the delivery of 60,000 maravedis a year, which put an end to the claim. It is probable that the Velasco family had possessed part of the lands of the county, if we take for certain the hypothesis already put forward that in 1420 Fernández Manrique received lost lands through sale or inheritance and a title of count, but not the whole county or his first noble title. This same loss of land occurred at the same time in other nearby lordships, such as the Marquisate of Aguilar, from which Liébana and La Pernía were separated. It is possible that the Velascos received the lands by concession from Enrique III. In addition, the Velascos received the county of Castañeda from the hands of Juan II.\nIn 1421, due to certain bellicose acts and disobedience to the king, John II of Castile gave Álvaro de Luna the town of San Esteban de Gormaz, which belonged to the dominions of Fernández Manrique. The latter, determined to assert the privileges he had received, called himself Count of Castañeda and took possession of the place. The king forbade his lordship and ordered the inhabitants to seize Fernández Manrique if he tried to impose himself on them as lord, and to send him to his court. However, the messenger carrying the orders was beaten by knights loyal to Manrique. Months later Juan II set out for Castañeda to take reprisals. He stayed in Aguilar de Campoo and sent ahead the corregidor Pedro González del Castillo with a large escort. Pedro tried the count's followers, killing some of them, and demolished several houses and towers. Garci Fernández Manrique, however, fled. He presented himself before the king in Madrid together with the Infante Enrique on 13 June 1422 to pay him homage, but the king imprisoned them in the Alcázar. From there Manrique was taken to Ávila, and his goods were confiscated until 1428, when he was released and his lands were returned to him. In 1429 he took the oath of the great knights to the king, after which Juan II definitively established the title of Castañeda in his favour.\nThe first count tried to seize the valley of Toranzo and some territories of the Asturias de Santillana, usurping the jurisdiction of the justice in Cartes.\n\n\n==== Second Count Juan Fernández Manrique ====\nJuan Fernández Manrique was the second Count of Castañeda. He was heir to Garci Manrique, who left him the county, along with other lands, in his will of 1436, and great-grandson of Tello, brother Henry II of Castile through his mother. Juan took advantage of his power in matters of justice to give shelter to various criminals. In 1480 he established an entailed Majorat. Juan Manrique was bellicose and ambitious, so that the inhabitants of the county continually complained to the kings. In 1480, the kings ordered the demolition of the manor tower of Toranzo as a punishment. He sought to extend his dominion and to extend the privileges of his lineage.\nJuan Manrique received from his mother Aldonza, in her will of 1443, the lordship of Campoo. To prove his right over Aguilar, Juan presented documents purporting to prove the inheritance, documents that Enrique II had given to Tello before he died in a strange way. Despite the complaints of his brother Gabriel Fernández Manrique, the first Count of Osorno, Juan gave the marquisate to his first-born son Garci Fernández Manrique (1st Marquis of Aguilar de Campoo), a bastard son legitimised in 1453 by King John II. The Council of Castile allowed this inheritance with the exception of the monastery of Santa María la Real.\nIn 1462 he bought the county of Buelna (the territory, not the title), so he was called \"Count of Buelna\". His great-great-grandson Luis Fernández Manrique de Lara, 4th Marquis of Aguilar de Campoo, also used this title, as did his son Bernardo Manrique de Lara y Mendoza de Aragón, 5th Marquis of Aguilar de Campoo, although none of these three possessed the title of Count of Buelna.\n\n\n==== Third Count Garci Fernández Manrique ====\nJuan Manrique, who died at the age of 95, left Castañeda to his son Garci Fernández Manrique, who managed to legitimise his possession of Aguilar, as the Catholic Monarchs officially recognised his title of 1st Marquis over that lordship and allowed him to appoint merinos in Trasmiera, Toranzo and Carrión; however, the kings took the opportunity to curtail the rights that the Counts of Castañeda had taken by force in royal territories. The legitimisation of these domains made the 3rd Count of Castañeda and 1st Marquis of Aguilar de Campoo one of the most powerful figures in what is now Cantabria, if not the most powerful. However, his power was threatened by the complaints of various valleys, which rose up in lawsuits against him, although only Orbaneja managed to impose itself on him by judicial means, in 1494. After Garci Fernández Manrique, the lordships of Castañeda and Aguilar were united.\nThe current holder of the title is Álvaro Travesedo y Juliá, XXVIII Count of Castañeda, since 2003.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nSalazar Y Castro (2001).

        "content": "Peperomia hunteriana is a plant in the pepper family Piperaceae found only in the Wet Tropics bioregion of Queensland, Australia.\n\n\n== Description ==\nPeperomia hunteriana is a small, succulent, erect herb growing up to 10 cm (3.9 in) tall with a dense covering of reddish hairs on the stems. The leaves are usually presented in whorls of three, or rarely four. The leaf blades are also densely hairy and are held on petioles about 2 mm (0.08 in) long. Leaf shape is obovate to rounded and the secondary venation is obscure. They may reach up to 26 mm (1.02 in) long by 14 mm (0.55 in) wide.\nThe inflorescence is a spike up to 5 cm (2.0 in) long, which may or may not be branched.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThis species was first described by the Australian botanist Paul Irwin Forster, based on material collected from Mount Bartle Frere by Forster in 1997. Forster's paper describing the new species was published in 1999 in Austrobaileya, the journal of the Queensland Herbarium.\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe species epithet hunteriana was chosen by Forster in recognition of John Hunter from Coffs Harbour, New South Wales, who first collected specimens of this species.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThe native range of this species is restricted to a small part of northeastern Queensland, Australia, from the highland areas of the Daintree National Park immediately west of Mossman, southwards to Mount Bartle Frere. It grows on rocky outcrops close to, or within, rainforest at altitudes from about 1,100 m (3,600 ft) up to 1,520 m (4,990 ft)\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nThis species is listed by the Queensland Government's Department of Environment, Science and Innovation as least concern. As of 14 April 2024, it has not been assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nView a map of herbarium collections of this species at the Australasian Virtual Herbarium\nView observations of this species on iNaturalist\nView images of this species on Flickriver.com",

Her family had moved from Germany in 1938 in an attempt to escape persecution by the Nazis, but her six siblings died in Auschwitz concentration camp, where her mother was also imprisoned but survived, with damaged health. The family later moved to Düren in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.In her film-making and other activism she worked to reveal the Nazi genocide of the Sinti and other Romani people. In 1999 she was awarded the Otto Pankok Prize, inaugurated by Günter Grass in memory of his teacher Otto Pankok.Her film Das Falsche Wort is in the permanent collection of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and her work was included in the online World Roma Congress Art Exhibition in 2021. Her 1981 film, Es ging Tag und Nacht, liebes Kind (It went day and night, dear child), made with Katrin Seybold, covered the night of 2-3 August 1944 when the last Sinti and Roma prisoners in Auschwitz-Birkenau were killed in the gas chambers.  Spitta and Seybold also made the 1981 film We are Sinti Children and Not Gypsies, which is available on Mubi.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\nSchimpft uns nicht Zigeuner  (1980, Don't scold us as gypsies)\nWir sind Sintikinder und keine Zigeuner (1981, We are Sinti children and not gypsies)\nEs ging Tag und Nacht liebes Kind (1982, It went day and night, dear child)\nDas Falsche Wort (1987, The wrong word)\nMeleza und Gallier (1996, Meleza and Gallier)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMelanie Spitta at IMDb\nInterview with Sitta's daughter, Carmen Spitta",

        "content": "On 29 November 1885, Thibaw Min, the last king of Burma, his senior queen, Supayalat and Burmese royals were exiled to Ratnagiri, India, a port city off the Arabian Sea after defeated by British Empire in the Third Anglo-Burmese War. The banishment was called Pataw Mu (Burmese: ပါတော်မူ; MLCTS: pattaumhu:, pronounced [pàtàʊ m̥ù]) which means taken away.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Biographies of Thibaw Min and Supayalat (Summary) ===\nThibaw Min, born Maung Yay Set in 1859, was the last king of Burma from the Konbaung dynasty. He was the son of Mindon Min and Laungshe Mibaya, one of his consorts. Thibaw's mother had been banished from the palace court by Mindon and spent her final years as a thilashin (သီလရှင်). Thibaw succeeded his father in 1878 after a massacre that ended with the deaths of many royals. He was exiled to Ratnagiri, India (then British India) after the British invasion of Mandalay in 1885. Thibaw's wife, Supayalat, was known for her ambition and advocacy for war with the British. She was the half sister of Thibaw and they fell in love while Thibaw's monkhood. She was said to have forced monogamy on Thibaw, breaking ancient custom. After Thibaw's death in 1916, Supayalat fought in vain for the right to take her husband's body back to Burma for burial.\n\n\n=== The Third Anglo-Burmese War ===\nMain article - Third Anglo-Burmese War\nThe Third Anglo-Burmese War, the final conflict in a series of wars between the British Empire and the Kingdom of Konbaung occurred from 7 to 29 November 1885 with sporadic resistance continuing into 1887. This war marked the end of Burma's independence under the Konbaung dynasty as the British had already annexed Lower Burma in 1853 after the Second Anglo-Burmese War. The Third War was triggered by British concerns over French influence in Burma and a boundary dispute between India and Burma.\nThe British, fearing French expansion in Southeast Asia, sought to assert their dominance in the region. Tensions escalated when the British unilaterally marked the border between India and Burma, leading to Burmese objections. In response, the British launched a military campaign to secure their interests and extend their control over Burma.\nBritish forces swiftly advanced towards Mandalay, the Burmese royal capital, facing minimal resistance. King Thibaw Min and his queen, Supayalat were captured and exiled to Ratnagiri in British India. This marked the end of Burmese sovereignty, as the country came under [[British rule|British rule in Burma as a province of the British Raj.\nThe aftermath of the war saw Burma governed as a separate colony by the British until it gained independence as a republic in 1948. The Third Anglo-Burmese War had lasting implications for Burma, shaping its future political landscape and relationship with the British Empire. It marked the end of an era for the Burmese monarchy and the beginning of a new chapter in the country's history under British colonial rule.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThibaw Min\nSupayalat\nThird Anglo-Burmese War\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Balkan Bulgarian Airlines Flight 130 was a scheduled passenger flight from Paris–Le Bourget Airport to Sofia Airport with a stopover in Zurich Airport that, on 18 January 1971, crashed while on approach to Zürich. All but two occupants were killed.\n\n\n== Aircraft ==\nThe accident aircraft was an Ilyushin Il-18, either of the D or E variant. Its factory number was 18600900, and its serial number was 090-02. It was manufactured and first flew in 1966; later it began operating for Balkan Bulgarian Airlines with registration LZ-BED.The Il-18 was inspected two days before the accident. By the time of the crash, the aircraft was considered airworthy, having logged 8,622 flight hours and 3,136 pressurisation cycles. There were eight crew members: a captain, a co-pilot, a navigator, a flight engineer, a radio operator, a trainee, and two flight attendants. The captain was Vladimir Vladov.\n\n\n== Accident ==\nFlight 130 departed Paris in the afternoon and climbed to their assigned altitude. After entering Zurich airspace, the captain asked for the weather conditions there and heard reports about improving weather. The air traffic controller cleared the flight for landing. They initiated approach in bad conditions. On final approach, the crew noticed the plane was off-course and tried to correct; however at 15:49, the left wingtip and undercarriage struck the ground. The Il-18 ended up in flames 700 m (2,300 ft) short of the runway. The crash destroyed the aircraft.\n\n\n== Victims ==\nOut of the occupants, 14 were West German, 12 were Bulgarian (including the eight crew members), nine were French, four were Syrian, two were Lebanese, one was Brazilian, one was Dutch, one was Argentinian, one was Austrian, one was Finnish, and one was British. Out of the 47 occupants, only two survived. A 12-year-old boy and Captain Vladov survived the accident. Most people died from the post-crash fire and smoke.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nThe crash was investigated in Switzerland. The black box was significantly damaged and data could not be extracted. An interview with Captain Vladov stated that five years of investigation could not establish a cause. However, other sources state that the investigation concluded that the crew failed to follow published procedures while initiating an ILS approach on runway 16 which led to the Il-18 passing below the minimum descent altitude. The thick fog was also considered a contributing factor.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The composite index or composite indicator (abbreviated as c-score) is a new numerical indicator that evaluates the quality of a scientist's research publications, regardless of the scientific field in which he/she operates.\nIt was initially introduced in 2016 by the Greek-American metascience researcher John Ioannidis at Stanford University and his collaborators, R. Klavans R. and K. Boyack. In 2019 an improved version of it was announced in the scientific journal PLOS Biology under the paper title \"Updated science-wide author databases of standardized citation indicators\".\nBased on a metaresearch study by Ioannidis et al., the new c-score is calculated by an algorithm that combines all scientific research fields and ranks research from the Scopus database across all research areas, even from those with lower citation density.\nSuch meta-research has analyzed and recently published, ultimately identifing the top 2% of the world's most influential scientists, in a unified way across each and every scientific sub-discipline.\nIn general, the parameters that are taken into account and eventually determine the new composite-index (c-score) are the following ones:\n\nthe total number of citations received (NC),\nthe Hirsch index for the citations received (H),\nthe Schreiber co-authorship adjusted Hm index for the citations received (Hm).\nthe total number of citations received to papers for which the scientist is single author (NCS),\nthe total number of citations received to papers for which the scientist is single or first author (NCSF), and\nthe total number of citations received to papers for which the scientist is single, first, or last author (NCSFL).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sheba (Hebrew: שְׁבָא‎) also known as Saba' is a biblical figure mentioned in the Book of Genesis. He is traditionally believed to be an ancient king of Yemen. He also plays a huge role in Arabian folklore as being the ancestor of the tribes of Sabaeans and later Himyarites who ruled Yemen until the middle of the 6th century CE. \n\n\n== Genealogy and family ==\n\n\n=== Biblical viewpoint ===\nSheba is mentioned in the Book of Genesis as being the son of Joktan, who is in turn the son of Eber. Hence, he is a descendant of Noah through Noah's son Shem. Meanwhile, the Generations of Noah mention that Sheba (spelled here with samekh as Seba) is a son of Jokshan, hence making him a grandson of Abraham and his spouse Keturah. There are several possible reasons for this confusing twist of genealogies. One theory is that the Sabaeans established many colonies to control the trade routes and the large number of their colonies confused the ancient Israelites, as their ethnology was less racially-based and more based on geographically and politically based.  Another theory suggests that the Sabaeans hailed from the region of the Levant and established their kingdom on the ruins of the Minaeans.\n\n\n=== Islamic viewpoint ===\nThe Arabs believe that Sheba, known in Arabic as Saba', is the son of Yashjub, who is in turn a son of Ya'rub, the son of Qahtan. Some Muslim scholars including Ibn Ishaq have brought forward that the real name of Saba' was 'Abd al-Shams ibn Yashjub. His sons are then believed to be Himyar ibn Saba' and Kahlan ibn Saba', who were the progenitors of the Himyarites and Kahlan respectively. There is also a Hadith which narrates that Saba' himself had ten sons (including the aforementioned two).\n\n\n== Sheba in the Islamic tradition ==\nSheba is believed to have been a monotheist and a wise king in Islamic tales. According to the traditional account, it was revealed to Sheba through a vision in his dreams that a Prophet would be coming many years after him.Afterwards, Sheba composed a series of poems dedicating his anticipation for the coming of this Prophet, later revealed to be Muhammad. One of such poems was supposedly preserved:\n After Qahtan a prophet will rule, pious, humble, the very best of mankind.\nHe will be named Ahmad, and I wish I could be given a year to live after his coming, to support him and award him my aid with all fully armed warriors and all marksmen. \n\nWhen he appears, become his helpers, and let he who meets him pass on my greeting!\n\n\n== See also ==\nQahtan\nJoktan\nSabaeans\nHimyarite Kingdom\nList of rulers of Saba' and Himyar\n\n\n== References ==",

The bank was initially based in the Roskilde City Hall. In 1877, it relocated to a new building at Stændertorvet 4.\nOver the years, the savings bank grew to become one of the Denmarklargest provincial savings banks. In 1987, a combination of failed fund dispositions and other factors led to a need for financial consolidation. In 1887,  it merged with Horsens Sparekasse and Østjyske egns-sparekasse under the name DK-Sparekassen. However, it soon became clear that the merger did not lead to the desired result, and already the following year this was openly acknowledged and new opportunities were sought. The result was a merger in 1989 with Sparekassen Bikuben.\n\n\n== Building ==\nThe building from 1866 was designed by Johan Daniel Herholdt. It was later expanded several times. In 1977, it was replaced by a modern building. The new building comprised Algade 5–7 and the southern part of Palæstræde's south side.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSource",

In 698, his son Dae Jo-yeong founded the kingdom of Balhae. When Balhae fell to the Liao dynasty, a son of Balhae's last king Dae Inseon, Dae T'ak (대탁; 大鐸) led a group of refugees to Goryeo and settled down in Miryang, beginning the founding of the Miryang Dae clan.\nThe first ancestor recorded in the genealogy was Dae T'ak (대탁; 大鐸), who served as the Minister of Personnel. His son was Dae Tŏk-se (대덕세; 大德歲) who held a government office during the Joseon dynasty and for his service to the country, was enfeoffed as the Lord of Miryang (밀양군; 密陽君). His son Dae Mun-gi (대문기; 大文記) served as the Chief Magistrate of Hanseong (한성판윤; 漢成判尹). Other prominent members of this clan were: Dae Chung-t'aek (대중택; 大重澤) who served as ch'ŏm-chijungch'ubusa (첨지중추부사; 僉知中樞府事) and  Dae Kuk-ŏn (대국언; 大國彦), who served as the Minister of Revenue (호조판서; 戶曹判書).\nAccording to the 1985 South Korean census, there were 499 members of the Miryang Dae clan, from 115 households. In the 2000 South Korean census, the population decreased to 492 members, but the number of households increased to 162.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDae (surname)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jon Nygaard (born 1946) is a Norwegian Ibsen scholar and professor emeritus at the Centre for Ibsen Studies at the University of Oslo. He represents the \"aesthetic-historical\" approach to Ibsen research and has advocated for a greater focus on viewing Ibsen and his works in the context of his contemporaries rather than as a genius.\nNygaard earned his PhD (mag.art.) at the University of Oslo in 1969, and the following year, he was appointed as a research fellow at the same university. In 1973, he became a lecturer in theater studies at the University of Trondheim and was promoted to associate professor there in 1975. From 1984 to 2016, he served as an associate professor and, from 2001, as a professor in theater studies at the University of Oslo.\nHis book on Henrik Ibsen's Ibsen's wider social milieu and ancestry contributed significantly to what scholars have described as a \"revolution\" in historical research on Henrik Ibsen's life, that has debunked numerous myths previously taken for granted.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Henry Robert Beak  (12 January 1912 – 9 May 2006) was an Australian local government politician.\nBeak is perhaps best remembered for his lengthy tenure as the chairman of Livingstone Shire Council, serving in the position from 1961 until 1982, making him the third longest serving chairman of the council.\nHowever, he is also credited with ensuring the preservation of St Christopher's Chapel – a timber-and-stone chapel erected by American servicemen at Nerimbera during the Second World War.\n\n\n== Public life ==\nBeak was first elected to Livingstone Shire Council in 1946 as a councillor representing Division 1, and was elected as chairman in 1961.\nAfter gaining preselection to be the County Party candidate for the seat of Keppel, Beak contested the 1950 Queensland state election, but was defeated by incumbent Labor MP Walter Ingram.\nDuring his time as chairman of the Livingstone Shire Beak campaigned for the local area, particularly the Capricorn Coast, to become a drawcard for tourists. Beak was keen to see Yohachiro Iwasaki's much anticipated but controversial international resort become a reality, describing the local area as having been \"a bit of a backwater\" in relation to tourism.\nHe was also a proponent of amalgamations and was of the opinion Livingstone Shire should merge with neighbouring councils as he believed people who resided further west treated the Capricorn Coast as their \"playground\" but contributed very little financially to the local council.\nIn 1991, nine years after concluding his tenure as chairman, Beak presented the Electoral and Administrative Review Commission with his own amalgamation proposal. He argued that a \"super shire\" would curtail the high cost associated with local government while also assisting tourism.\nIn 2008, a year after Beak's death, the Boundaries Commission recommended Livingstone Shire, Mount Morgan Shire and Fitzroy Shire all merge with Rockhampton City Council to form Rockhampton Regional Council as part of sweeping changes across the state which saw the number of local councils in Queensland halved. However, the move was met with staunch opposition from those in Livingstone Shire and after a successful de-amalgamation campaign, Livingstone Shire was re-established in 2014.\nIn addition to his local government service, Beak was also a member of the Rockhampton Harbour Board throughout the late 1940s and 1950s.\nBeak is also credited with preserving St Christopher's Chapel at Nerimbera, becoming the original caretaker of the chapel in 1947 following the departure of the American military at the conclusion of the second world war. Beak also wrote about the history of the chapel in 1986, which has since been expanded upon by his daughter and son-in-law.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\n\nIn September 1952, it was announced Beak was engaged to WAAAF aircraftwoman Diedre Brett.\nThey were married on 31 December 1952 at St Paul's Cathedral in Rockhampton.\nAfter their marriage, they settled on Beak's family property called \"Broadmeadows\" at Nankin.\nBeak died on 9 May 2006.\nHis widow Diedre Beak died on 7 January 2017.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nThe Henry Beak Bridge across Ross Creek in Yeppoon was named in Beak's honour and was officially opened on 18 March 1972.\nIn the 1990 Australia Day Honours, Beak was awarded an Order of Australia medal for his service to local government and to the local community.\nIn 1992, Beak was awarded the National Medal with a first clasp in recognition of his service as a fire warden with the Queensland Rural Fire Service. He was awarded a second clasp in 1998.\nSix and a half years after Beak's death, both his Order of Australia medal and his national medal were among items stolen during a break-in at the family property on 4 January 2013 where his 95 year old widow still lived. Two men were subsequently arrested and charged with robbery.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Wilfred Sizer,  (23 February 1920 – 22 December 2006) was a British flying ace who served in the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the Second World War. He is credited with having shot down twelve aircraft.\nBorn in Chelmsford, Sizer joined the RAF in 1938 and was serving with No. 213 Squadron at the time of the outbreak of the Second World War. He flew extensively in the Battle of France and the subsequent Battle of Britain, claiming a number of aerial victories. He commanded No. 93 Squadron during the final months of the Tunisian campaign and during the invasion of Sicily. He left the RAF in 1946 but after briefly working as a charter pilot, he rejoined the service. His postwar career in the RAF included a period as commander of No. 54 Squadron. After his retirement from the military in 1963, he worked for an avionics company in the Middle East. He spent his final years in England and died in 2006, aged 86.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nWilfred Max Sizer was born on 23 February 1920 at Chelmsford, in England. He was educated locally, at King Edward VI Grammar School. In early 1938, he joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) on a short service commission, commencing his flying training shortly afterwards. At the end of the year, he was posted to No. 17 Squadron which operated Gloster Gauntlet fighters from Kenley. He served with this unit for six months, at which time he was transferred to No. 213 Squadron.\n\n\n== Second World War ==\nAt the time of the outbreak of the Second World War, No. 213 Squadron was based at the RAF station at Wittering and operated Hawker Hurricane fighters. It was tasked with carrying out patrols along the east coast of England.\n\n\n=== Battle of France ===\nA week after the invasion of France on 10 May 1940, No. 213 Squadron was sent to Merville to reinforce the RAF presence there. It was immediately called upon for defensive patrolling and bomber escort duties. The same day or the next, he damaged a Henschel Hs 126 reconnaissance aircraft. On 19 May he shared in the destruction of two more Hs 126s in the Lille area. The next day, he shared in the shooting down of a Dornier Do 17 medium bomber near Tournai. On 21 May, Sizer, making his final patrol before the squadron returned to England later in the day, was shot down by a Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter, crash-landeding his Hurricane near De Panne. He received facial wounds as a result but was able to make his way to a first aid station for treatment. He secured travel to England the same day and after only two days rejoined his squadron. \nOn its return to England, one of No. 213 Squadron's flights was based at Manston and making cross-channel flights to operate over the French coast. Towards the end of the month the squadron helped provide aerial cover over the beaches at Dunkirk during the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). Sizer destroyed a Bf 109 over Dunkirk on 28 May. The next day, he damaged a Heinkel He 111 medium bomber that was bombing the evacuation beaches. He shot down one Bf 109 and damaged a second on the last day of the month, but his Hurricane was set afire by another Bf 109 and he crash-landed near Dunkirk. He made his way back to England aboard Plynlimon, a Clyde paddle steamer, and rejoined his squadron, having been reported missing in action in the interim.\n\n\n=== Battle of Britain ===\nOnce the evacuation of the BEF was completed, No. 213 Squadron was briefly based at Biggin Hill before it shifted to Exeter in Devon, as part of No. 10 Group, in late June and served from here throughout the Battle of Britain on interception duties along the English Channel. Sizer destroyed a Junkers Ju 88 medium bomber over the Isle of Portland on 11 August, and this was followed the next day by his destruction of a Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighter near Bognor. On 15 August, No. 213 Squadron and two other squadrons were scrambled to intercept a large group of Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers escorted by Bf 109s and Bf 110s. Originally headed for the RAF station at Warmwell, the German formation had been diverted to Portland after encountering several RAF fighters on the way. Sizer shot down a pair of Ju 87s over the isle.\nAlthough No. 213 Squadron remained active during the reminder of the Battle of Britain, Sizer claimed only one further aerial victory in the campaign; a Ju 88 destroyed near Beachy Head that was shared with a pilot of No. 253 Squadron on 5 October. By this time, he was a flying officer, having been promoted to this rank in September. The next month Sizer was recognised for his successes with an award of a Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC). This was gazetted on 8 November and the published citation read:  \n\nDuring a period of five days in France, this officer destroyed one enemy aircraft and shared in the destruction of four others. Since the return of the squadron to this country, Flying Officer Sizer has taken part in a large number of patrols and has personally destroyed at least a further six enemy aircraft. During one patrol he was attacked and shot down by five Messerschmitts. Landing two miles outside La Panne, he swam across a canal and was taken to a casualty station suffering from facial wounds, and thence to England. After only two days sick leave he again participated in patrols with his squadron.\n\n\n=== Later war service ===\nAt the end of the year, Sizer was posted to No. 55 Operational Training Unit (OTU) as an instructor. In April 1941, he returned to front-line service with a transfer to No. 1 Squadron, where he was a flight commander. At the time, the squadron was working towards being operational on night fighter duties while also carrying out offensive sorties with its Hurricanes to German-occupied Europe. In the middle of the year he was shifted to No. 91 Squadron, a Supermarine Spitfire fighter squadron at Hawkinge. His service here was brief, for within a matter of weeks he was assigned to No. 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit (PRU). This was another short-term posting as in August he returned to instructing duties at No. 57 OTU at Hawarden. By this time he was a flight lieutenant, having been promoted in September 1941.\nIn April 1942, Sizer was posted to No. 152 Squadron as a flight commander. The squadron was based at Eglinton, flying patrols over the Irish Sea and sorties to the northwest of France with its Spitfires. On 25 August he shared in the destruction of a Ju 88 to the north of Ireland. Later in the year, the squadron moved to North Africa to support the Allied operations in Tunisia. Based at Souk-el-Arba, it flew bomber escort missions and offensive patrols to Tunis. On 23 November, not long after its arrival in Tunisia, Sizer damaged a Macchi C.202 fighter near Tunis. He damaged a Ju 88 on 28 December.\nSizer was given command of his own unit, No. 93 Squadron, in January 1943. Like his previous unit, his command was engaged in the Tunisian campaign, flying Spitfires from Souk-el-Khemis Airfield on fighter sweeps, bomber escort duties and Rhubarb missions. Once the fighting in North Africa ended, No. 93 Squadron shifted to Malta, flying from Hal Far in support of the Allied invasion of Sicily as part of No. 324 Wing. It flew patrols over the landing beaches during the Allied invasion of the island. \nSizer damaged a Ju 88 on 10 July and damaged a Bf 109 two days later. Returning to Malta after the latter engagement, he had to crash-land his Spitfire due to a failure in the undercarriage. On 13 July he shot down a MC.202, probably destroyed a second and damaged four others, all over Augusta in Sicily. He relinquished command of the squadron in August to return to instructing duties at No. 71 OTU in Ismailia. He was awarded a Bar to his DFC the following month. \nMade a temporary squadron leader at the start of 1944, Sizer's rank was made substantive a few months. The final months of his war service was spent as commander of No. 680 PRU, based at Deversoir. He left the RAF in 1946, holding the rank of wing commander.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nOn his return to civilian life, Sizer started working as a charter pilot. However, after two years, he rejoined the RAF as a squadron leader. He initially served as an instructor at the Central Flying School and then in late 1953 was appointed commander of No. 54 Squadron at Odiham, which operated the Gloster Meteor jet fighter. He oversaw its subsequent conversion to the Hawker Hunter jet fighter two years later, relinquishing his command in January 1956. He later served in a staff role at the Air Ministry and also spent a period of time in Hong Kong. Having attained the rank of acting wing commander, he retired from the RAF in February 1963.\nSizer worked in the private sector, for Marconi Radar in the Middle East, for several years until his retirement in 1985. He spent his final years living on the outskirts of Chelmsford. He died on 22 December 2006, survived by his wife Nita, who he had married in 1942, and the couple's three sons. A portrait of Sizer, executed in October 1940 by the official war artist Cuthbert Orde, is held by the Royal Air Force Museum.\nSizer is credited with having shot down twelve aircraft, five being shared with other pilots. He also claimed one aircraft as probably destroyed and ten damaged.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBungay, Stephen (2015) [2000].

        "content": "Skywaters Residences is a 63-storey mixed-use building under construction in the Downtown Core district of Singapore. The skyscraper is expected to replace Guoco Tower as the tallest building in Singapore upon its completion in 2028. The 305 m (1,001 ft) tall building will house offices, retail stores, residential units and a hotel.\n\n\n== Background ==\nJointly developed by Singapore's Perennial Holdings and Alibaba, the skyscraper stands on the site of the former AXA Tower. The redevelopment of the AXA Towers were first announced on July 7, 2022, when redevelopment plans for a new 63-storey building with a height of 1,001 feet (305 metres) were approved by the Urban Redevelopment Authority for a consortium consisting of Alibaba, Perennial Holdings, and local partners. This marked the new building as the tallest skyscraper ever approved to be constructed in Singapore. The mixed-use building will be mostly made up of office, hotel, and residential spaces, with an observation level and some retail space. It is planned to be completed by 2028.\n\n\n== Construction and design ==\nIn May 2022, the AXA Tower was closed demolition works. The new building will retain the AXA tower's foundation, to reduce materials used in the construction and to reduce environmental impact during redevelopment. A S$3 billion real estate green loan, was secured by Perennial Holdings and its partners in November 2022 for the development of the site, with sustainability construction being incorporated into the design and development of the new building.Designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and Singapore's DCA Architects, the building will feature 148,000 square metres (1,590,000 sq ft) of floor space, with 3 storeys of retail spaces, 19 storeys of offices, 3 storeys of hotel suites and 36 storeys of residential units. The building will also feature 10,000 square metres (110,000 sq ft) of green spaces, as well as a rainwater irrigation system for plants located within the green spaces.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of tallest buildings in Singapore\nList of buildings\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Gerd Hay-Edie (b. Trondheim, Norway 4 November 1904, d. 1997) was a pioneering handweaver and textile designer. She created The Mourne Check and The Mourne Mist for Robin Day's furniture range and fabric for Sybil Connolly’s clothing designs.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nIn 1904 Gerd Bergerson was born in Trondheim, to Olav Bergerson and Ynghild Grønning. She had three brothers. She attended both private and government schools, and went on to study design and hand-weaving at the Home Industries School for Women, Oslo. She was engaged as a young woman but did not marry.\n\n\n== Early work ==\nAfter leaving the Home Industries School, Bergerson was sent by the Norwegian government to Bilbao, Spain, for 18 months to teach weaving. In 1932 she moved to England and worked for the Rural Industries Bureau, travelling the country advising handweavers. In 1933 she created textiles for Holywell Mills in Flintshire, including the “very first double-weave furnishing fabrics used by Gordon Russell.”\n\n\n=== Wilhelm Reich and Dartington ===\nIn 1936 she oversaw the Dartington Hall textile mill, where she became friends with town planner and journalist Jacqueline Weaver. She also met the Austrian psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich (1897–1957), who told her, “You interest me. I want to know you.” About this comment, Bergerson later said she “sensed danger.”\nLater that year she returned to Norway, where she advised on home industries, and worked at Nydalen, Norway's largest textile mill. Aged 27 she was named “Advisor to the Norwegian Home Industries”. She helped establish Røros Tweed and the Norwegian Tapestry Yarn Company. When she moved into a flat in Oslo, Reich turned up on her doorstep, saying, “I told you I’d find you. I would like to find out more about you.” They developed an intellectual and sometimes physical relationship. Reich proposed marriage, but Bergerson refused. He had children by his first wife, and she knew that “marrying Reich would have meant subjugating her career to his”, something she was not prepared to do.\n\n\n=== Marriage and Asia ===\nShe married Englishman Archie Hay-Edie (1904–1994) on 22 October 1938 at St John's, Windermere, Cumbria. She admits marrying Hay-Edie “on the rebound from Reich, someone completely different: a safe English gentleman – only to learn there is no such thing as a safe partner.” They spent WWII in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Calcutta, for Archie's work in the shipping industry. They had four children; she gave birth to her first daughter in Shanghai and first son in Calcutta. \nIn China she learned to use local looms and in India she learnt to make hand-woven rugs. In Calcutta, the Palace of the Maharajah of Gwalior commissioned 22 hand-woven rugs from her. While in India, she met someone from County Down, Ireland. His description of the County Down countryside motivated her to move there with her children in 1947. Archie came a few years later, his work in the shipping industry keeping him in Asia.\n\n\n== Ireland ==\nBetween Asia and Ireland, she lived in England. In 1947 Hay-Edie and her children moved to Kilkeel, County Down.She initially installed a loom in her house, founding Mourne Industries, her intention being to establish a design studio. However she couldn't find sufficiently skilled craftworkers to make her creations so  she moved into larger premises at Killowen, Rostrevor and began to train local women to work the looms, using Irish yarns from Donegal. In 1948 Jacqueline Weaver, her friend from Dartington, travelled to Ireland to help look after Hay-Edie's children, allowing Hay-Edie to devote more time to getting her business up and running. In 1949 she established the company Mourne Textiles. One of her products was an unusually woven “shaggy dog” cloth”.\n\n\n=== Collaborations and commissions ===\nIn the early 1950s Robin Day wrote to Hay-Edie, “Of all the rugs which I have seen, only yours have got the character enough as a background for my new designs of furniture to be exhibited at La Triennale de Milano 1951…” Her rugs were exhibited alongside Day's furniture at the 1951 Milan Trienniale, earning her a silver medal and diploma. This success led to a long-term relationship with Day's Hille furniture brand through the 1950s and 1960s.\nHay-Edie collaborated with fashion designer Sybil Connolly in 1950. In 1954 Terence Conran commissioned Hay-Edie to create textiles for his furniture ranges. One of her creations was Blazer furnishing fabric. In 1956 she won the bid to provide fabric for London Airport, her largest order to date. In 1961 she collaborated with local Down designer, Sheila Mullally.In 1966 Hay-Edie “walked into the Liberty store and, without an appointment, convinced the buyer for the textile department to take orders of her fabric designs.”\nDuring Hey-Edie's career, she also worked with the House of Lachasse and Hardy Amies.In the late 1970s much of Europe's textile production moved to Asia and Hay-Edie gradually had to let her weavers go. Her daughter, Karen, continued to accept commissions. Hey-Edie began exhibiting with Karen in 1980.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nHer work featured in the following exhibitions:\n\n1934: British Industries Fair, Birmingham\n1951: Milan Triennial, Festival of Britain as part of the Royal Society of Ulster Architects (RSUA) Design Group's exhibition of architecture \n1955: Helsingborg Exhibition, Helsingborg \n1958: Piccolo Gallery, Belfast, College of Technology, Belfast (1958)\n1964: Fine Crafts at the Arts Council, Dublin and Belfast (1964)\n1965: Hand and Machine, Design Centre London Arts Council Gallery, Belfast\n1966: Arts Council Gallery, Belfast, Trondheim\n1972: Octagon Gallery, Belfast\n1980: Octagon Gallery, Belfast\n1982: Gilford Castle, County Down\nOctober 2016 Gerd Hay-Edie – Evolutionary Weaver, Margaret Howell, LondonHay-Edie also exhibited in Oslo, Zürich and Copenhagen.\n\n\n== Television and radio ==\nHay-Edie appeared on the following programmes:\n\n1963 – she was the subject of UTV's Lady in Question\n1971 – interviewed by Gloria Hunniford on the BBC’s programme Talkabout\n1972 – interviewed by Nick Ross on BBC Radio 4\n\n\n== Memberships ==\nKilkeel Commonwealth Technical Training Team committee, member\nSociety of Industrial Arts (F.S.I.A.), fellow\nRed Rose Guild, member\nCraft Centre of Great Britain, member\nRoyal Ulster Academy, member\n\n\n== See also ==\nWilson, Colin (1996).

        "content": "The Moto Guzzi 750 Strada is a standard \t730 mm (28.7 inches) motorcycle first manufactured in 1992 by Italian company Moto Guzzi. Based on the Moto Guzzi 350 roadster,the 750 Strada was lighter than the V7 Sport, but much less powerful.\nFollowing the established Moto Guzzi pattern of a transverse V-twin engine and shaft drive, the 750 Strada used an enlarged version of the lightweight 1990s Guzzi 350/500 engine.\nThe 750 Strada was an easy-to-ride motorcycle, suitable as a first \"big bike\" whose 48 bhp output was never intimidating (and which gave a top speed of only some 95 mph).  (The earlier, heavier V7 produced some 70 bhp). The clever linked-braking system (where the foot pedal operated the rear brake and just one of the front discs) was safe and effective. The seat height was even lower than on the V7, making it attractive to women riders.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nhe 750 Strada was a motorcycle that never really caught the imagination of buyers, as the power output was too low for some bikers, while the smaller and cheaper 350 and 500 models served the purposes of riders seeking a runabout. The 750 Strada afforded the rider no wind protection, and was less reliable than some Moto Guzzis. Production was discontinued after only some 2 years.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMoto Guzzi 1000 Strada\nMoto Guzzi V7 Sport\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Moto Guzzi 750 Strada at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Theodora Maude Sweetapple known as Dora Sweetapple (May 25, 1872 – October 9, 1972) was an Australian nurse. She was one of the first district nurses and the first woman employed by the City of Adelaide.\n\n\n== Life ==\nSweetapple was born in 1872 in Port Adelaide. Her parents Ann Mapleson (born Mitchell) and William Deane Sweetapple who had a brother born in the UK. Her father was a shipping agent, but he died when she was very young. She was the tenth child and her mother ran a school which she attended. Between 1891 and 1893 she trained as a nurse at Adelaide Children's Hospital where she and Mabel Gill became life-long friends.\nThe District Trained Nursing Society (DTNS), was inaugurated on 12 July 1894 following 12 months work by a trained nurse, named McLellan, in the Adelaide suburb of Bowden. Sweetapple had already been visiting and nursing people at the suggestion of the local rector. She became the second nurse employed by the DTNS. In her first full year she was paid £30 with £55 for expenses. She took care of over 150 patients making 1612 visits to see them, taking advantage of free bus rides, a bicycle and a ferry crossing.\nThomas Borthwick who became Adelaide's first bacteriologist in 1894 employed her as \"city trained nurse\" in 1899 and she was the first woman to work for the City of Adelaide.\nThe Australasian Trained Nurses' Association was founded in 1905 with Sweetapple as a member. In 1906 she and Maude Gill worked at a private hospital which they ran until 1913 when they went to Britain staying there throughout World War One employed by the Order of St John of Jerusalem and the Queen's Institute of District Nursing. Back in Australia after the war, they ran a nursing home and then a boarding house together.\nGill died in 1965 and Sweetapple was herself nursed in an infirmary. She died in Leabrook seven years later. Sweetapple had been able to vote from 1894 when women were first permitted in Adelaide. 125 years later the city celebrated this achievement and Sweetapple was added to the city's honour role.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiography at ADB",

        "content": "Thotakura Gopichand (born 1993) is an Indian entrepreneur and pilot who is set to make a journey into space as a tourist. He is selected to travel to space as part of Blue Origin's New Shephard-25 (NS-25) mission, and if he completes the mission, he would be the second from India after astronaut Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma to travel beyond Karman line.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nGopichand is born into a Telugu family in Vijayawada but his family hails from Kakinada. He completed his Bachelor of Aeronautical Science degree from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in US. He is settled in Atlanta, Georgia, US. Apart from being an international medical pilot, he underwent professional training as a bush pilot, aerobatic pilot, seaplane pilot, glider pilot, and even as a hot air balloon instructor,\n\n\n== Career ==\nGopichand runs a wellness business, Preserve Life Corp, which he co-founded. The centre for holistic health and wellness, has its base in a 1200-acre area near Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. In 2019, he founded an Indian company, Charlie Foxtrot, that supports individuals and companies with professional private aviation services by hiring private jet charters both for business and leisure. He also provides air ambulances and other aviation support. During his stay at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University from January 2012 to August 2015, he excelled at training and received awards which included the Outstanding Leadership Award, Good Samaritan Award, and Outstanding Safety and Dedication Award.\n\n\n=== India's medical air ambulance missions ===\nGopichand is one of the pioneers in India's medical air ambulance services and it is an important part of his aviation career as he piloted Learjet 45XR aircraft to rural towns to rescue wounded citizens or on other medical emergencies. He carried out over 2000 such missions, including some which transported human organs to save critically ill patients. His experience as international medical jet pilot came in handy during such missions. He supported medical evacuation across 52 countries to help in medical emergencies.\n\n\n===== Suborbital spaceflight on New Shepard =====\nIn 2024, Gopichand was selected in a suborbital spacefight mission to fly on a planned Blue Origin's New Shepard NS-25. Gopichand is one of the six-person crew selected to travel to space in Blue Origin, a space company founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The others are Mason Angel, Sylvain Chiron, Kenneth L Hess, Carol Schaller and Ed Dwight, a former US Air Force Captain. The mission is expected to last around 11 minutes during which the spacecraft reaches an altitude of 80 to 100 km above sea level. The crew are expected to achieve weightlessness and return to earth on a parachute-assisted capsule. The launch date is yet to be announced.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Finesse\" is a song by American rapper BossMan Dlow, released on December 20, 2023, from 2 Slippery, the deluxe edition of his debut mixtape Too Slippery (2023). It was produced by Gentle Beatz. An official remix of the song featuring American rapper GloRilla was released on March 25, 2024.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nOver a trap and plugg instrumental, the song begins with the chorus, in which BossMan Dlow brags about earning money through illicit means and that he can teach his methods to others. In the first verse, he reflects on his past crimes and current success and lifestyle, such as making money, driving fast and receiving many calls and texts on his phone.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nPeter A. Berry of Stereogum described the beat as \"subdued, yet stylish\". He also commented on the song, \"BossMan gets off shit talk with ease, making street logistics sound like just another day at the office\" and \"Slick, yet emphatic, it's a level of cool you can't teach.\"\n\n\n== Remix ==\nThe official remix of the song was released on March 25, 2024. It features a minute-long verse from GloRilla, who raps about outdoing her competition, her New Year's resolution of celibacy, and knack for winning over male partners, before ending with a reference to the Evil Queen from \"Snow White\".\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sabine Ludwigs (born 1978) is a German chemist and Professor at the University of Stuttgart. Her research considers conductive molecular materials for technologies including photovoltaics and actuators. She investigates the functional properties (optical, electronic, electrochemical) of conductive polymers.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nLudwigs was born in Cologne. She was an undergraduate student at the University of Bayreuth, where she remained for her doctoral research in physical chemistry. Her research involved investigations into the complex nanostructures that form in triblock terpolymer thin films. She moved to the University of Cambridge as a postdoctoral researcher, where she spent two years.\n\n\n== Research and career ==\nIn 2006 Ludwigs established her own research group at the Institute for Macromolecular Chemistry at the University of Freiburg. Here she was a Junior Fellow and awarded an Emmy Noether Fellowship. She spent four years in the Freiburg Material Research Center before moving to the University of Stuttgart as Professor of Structure and Properties of Polymeric Materials.Her research considers semiconducting molecular materials for next-generation technologies, including photovoltaics and soft robotics. She investigates how molecular design impacts the functional properties of materials and structure-function relationships (e.g. how structure and morphology impacts optical and electronic properties). Alongside electrons, molecular materials can enable ionic transport, which makes them valuable materials for bioelectronics, personalised therapeutics and wearable medical devices.\n\n\n== Select publications ==\nJürgen Heinze; Bernardo A Frontana-Uribe; Sabine Ludwigs (1 August 2010). \"Electrochemistry of conducting polymers--persistent models and new concepts\".

        "content": "Marco Aurelio Avellaneda (1835 – January 29, 1911) was a prominent Argentine legislator and official. He was a deputy and senator of the nation and served in the ministry three times.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMarco Aurelio Martín Avellaneda y Silva was born in San Miguel de Tucumán, Tucumán, Argentina, in 1835, the son of Marco Manuel de Avellaneda and Dolores de Silva y Zavaleta. He was the brother of Nicolás Avellaneda, the future Argentine president, and of the legislator Eudoro Avellaneda.\nHe graduated with a doctorate in law from the University of Buenos Aires, later dedicating himself to politics. He was a national deputy for his province for the period 1876–1880 and was re-elected on other occasions until 1901. Dean of legislators, for 11 years he served as president of the Chamber of Deputies. He was the national auditor in the province of Corrientes and in the province of Buenos Aires.\nHe was appointed president of the Inspection Office of Guaranteed Banks until April 1890, when he resigned in the midst of the serious economic crisis during the government of Miguel Juárez Celman for refusing to authorize an issue of two million by the National Bank that promoted Minister Wenceslao Pacheco when the institution already lacked reserves. Finally, Pacheco would be forced to leave the ministry but would become president of the bank and carry out clandestine issues that would aggravate the crisis and cause the bankruptcy of the institution.\nBetween June 7, 1893, and July 18, 1893, he was minister of finance for President Luis Sáenz Peña. In June 1901, he was again appointed minister of finance by President Julio Argentino Roca, serving in the position until 1902.\nOn November 21, 1906, he became minister of the interior of President José Figueroa Alcorta, serving until September 27, 1907.\nIn 1909, he became a national senator until his death, which took place in the Tigre district on January 29, 1911.\n\n\n=== Sáenz Peña law ===\nIn 1910, during the Senate's treatment of the electoral reform law known as the Sáenz Peña Law, Marco Aurelio Avellaneda led the attack on the project, defending the complete list system \"under whose system the country had achieved all its progress\" and calling the \"harmless, undemocratic, and unconstitutional\" reform.\nAlready from the time of his passage through the Chamber of Deputies, he unofficially proposed a system of elections controlled by the government but guaranteeing sufficient transparency: \"my opinion is that the government, in consultation, passes the best decision to some people of recognized honesty, without excluding in an absolute way to no circle and without giving any a decisive preponderance, elect as Deputy among the honorable men of the country, more or less intelligent, more or less of good position, those who inspire the most confidence and with whose determined support he can count for your administrative progress for the good of the country (...) I wholeheartedly applaud the resolution you have made to exercise your influence in the provincial elections (...) Although the immense majority that makes the choice does not act with independence and knowledge, but rather by the influence to which it obeys, I believe that the most legitimate is that of the government, which is especially in charge of preserving public order, which is as a general rule the most impartial as it should be above the miseries and passions of the circles and which is finally the one that has the most responsibility since that of the circles is null due to the collective reason for being. What has been the result of the electoral struggles in which the governments have been or wanted to be dispensed with?\" But this intervention had to have limits \"I have been an opponent of certain electoral governments (...) I have fought and will always fight the abuse of official influence of the government that without consulting anything other than its whims, making the most unfriendly candidates to the people triumph against all odds (...) and I will always severely criticize governments that do not keep in mind the true conveniences of the country (sic) and that do not consult above all honesty and suitability for political positions.\nAnd he continued: \"here, as the time for the appointment of Deputies approaches, public indifference increases. As you have seen the copy of the Civic Registry that is published, you will not find a well-known name. The commercial and speculative spirit has invaded in such a way to all classes of society that no one is concerned other than finding means to earn money. The elections are made by (...) individuals who register assumed names, where people are hooked to vote and whoever returns for the vote would be disappointed. interest with which the newspapers deal with the electoral issue (…) The majority of the population does not read the newspapers but rather the advertisements from merchants . \"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nCutolo, Vicente Osvaldo (1968).

        "content": "Praziquantel (PZQ), sold under the brandname Biltricide among others, is a medication used to treat a number of types of parasitic worm infections in mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and fish. In humans specifically, it is used to treat schistosomiasis, clonorchiasis, opisthorchiasis, tapeworm infections, cysticercosis, echinococcosis, paragonimiasis, fasciolopsiasis, and fasciolosis. It should not be used for worm infections of the eye. It is taken by mouth.Side effects in humans may include poor coordination, abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, and allergic reactions. While it may be used during pregnancy, it is not recommended for use during breastfeeding. Praziquantel is in the anthelmintic class of medications. It works partly by affecting the function of the worm's sucker.Praziquantel was approved for medical use in the United States in 1982. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.\n\n\n== Medical uses ==\nPraziquantel is used to treat diseases caused by infection with several types of internal/gastrointestinal, and external parasites, including:\n\nHydatid disease caused by infection of various organs with larval stages of tapeworms of the genus Echinococcus\nCysticercosis caused by infection of the brain and/or muscles with the eggs and larvae of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium (though it has been judged less effective than albendazole in treatment of neurocysticercosis)\nIn dogs and cats, whose gastrointestinal tracts are infected with the tapeworms Dipylidium caninum or Taenia taeniaeformis, respectively; praziquantel is also often used in fixed combination with pyrantel embonate against the roundworms (ascarids): Toxocara cati and Toxascaris leonina. Praziquantel is also effective against Echinococcus multilocularis.\nSchistosomiasis caused by trematodes of the genus Schistosoma: As of 2005, praziquantel is the primary treatment for human schistosomiasis, for which it is usually effective in a single dose.\nClonorchiasis brought on by the Chinese liver fluke Clonorchis sinensis\nParagonimiasis caused by infection with lung flukes, mostly of the species Paragonimus westermani\nFasciolopsiasis caused by intestinal fluke Fasciolopsis buski\n\n\n== Side effects ==\nThe majority of side effects develop due to the release of the contents of the parasites as they are killed and the consequent host immune reaction. The heavier the parasite burden, the heavier and more frequent the side effects normally are.\nCentral nervous system (CNS): Frequently occurring side effects are dizziness, headache, and malaise. Drowsiness, somnolence, fatigue, and vertigo have also been seen. Almost all patients with cerebral cysticercosis experience CNS side effects related to the cell-death of the parasites (headache, worsening of pre-existing neurological problems, seizures, arachnoiditis, and meningism). These side effects may be life-threatening and can be reduced by coadministration of corticosteroids. All patients with cerebral cysticercosis are strongly recommended to be  hospitalized during treatment.\nGastrointestinal tract: About 90% of all patients have abdominal pain or cramps with or without nausea and vomiting. Diarrhea may develop and may be severe with colic. Sweating, fever, and sometimes bloody stools may occur together with diarrhea.\nLiver: Asymptomatic and transient increases of liver enzymes (AST and ALT) are noted frequently (up to 27%). No case of symptomatic liver damage has been seen so far.\nSensitivity reactions: Urticaria, rash, pruritus and eosinophilia in white blood cell counts\nOther locations/body as a whole: Lower back pain, myalgia, arthralgia, fever, sweating, various cardiac arrhythmias, and hypotension\n\n\n=== Pregnancy ===\nThe WHO states praziquantel is safe during pregnancy. Animal studies have failed to reveal evidence of fetal harm. Praziquantel is effective in reducing schistosomiasis during pregnancy. Another trial found that treatment with praziquantel did not increase the rates of low birthweight, fetal death, or congenital anomalies.\n\n\n== Drug interactions ==\nThe antibiotic rifampicin decreases plasma concentrations of praziquantel.Carbamazepine and phenytoin are reported to reduce the bioavailability of praziquantel. Chloroquine also reduces its bioavailability.The drug cimetidine heightens praziquantel bioavailability.\n\n\n== Mechanism of action ==\nThe drug's mode of action is not exactly known at present, but experimental evidence indicates praziquantel increases the permeability of the membranes of schistosome cells towards calcium ions. The drug thereby induces contraction of the parasites' muscle, resulting in paralysis in the contracted state. The dying parasites are dislodged from their site of action in the host organism and may enter systemic circulation or may be destroyed by host immune reaction (phagocytosis). Additional mechanisms including focal disintegrations and disturbances of oviposition (laying of eggs) are seen in other types of sensitive parasites.Another hypothesis regarding the mechanism of action is that it interferes with adenosine uptake in worms. This effect may have therapeutical relevance given that the schistosome, as the Taenia and the Echinococcus (other praziquantel-sensitive parasites), is unable to synthesize purines, such as adenosine, de novo.Bayer's Animal Health Division website states, \"Praziquantel is active against cestodes (tapeworms). Praziquantel is absorbed, metabolized in the liver, and excreted in the bile. Upon entering the digestive tract from the bile, cestocidal activity is exhibited. Following exposure to praziquantel, the tapeworm loses its ability to resist digestion by the mammalian host. Because of this, whole tapeworms, including the scolices (plural of \"scolex\"), are very rarely passed after administration of praziquantel. In many instances, only disintegrated and partially digested pieces of tapeworms will be seen in the stool. The majority of tapeworms are digested and are not found in the feces.\"Praziquantel is administered as a racemate, but only the (R)-enantiomer is biologically active; the enantiomers may be separated using a resolution of an amine obtained from praziquantel.\n\n\n== Pharmacokinetics ==\nPraziquantel is well absorbed (about 80%) from the gastrointestinal tract. However, due to extensive first-pass metabolism, only a relatively small amount enters systemic circulation. Praziquantel has a serum half-life of 0.8 to 1.5 hours in adults with normal renal and liver function. Metabolites have a half-life of 4 to 5 hours. In patients with significantly impaired liver function (Child-Pugh score B and C), the serum half-life is increased to 3 to 8 hours. Praziquantel and its metabolites are mainly excreted renally; within 24 h after a single oral dose, 70 to 80% is found in urine, but less than 0.1% as the unchanged drug. Praziquantel is metabolized through the cytochrome P450 pathway via CYP3A4.  Agents that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 such as phenytoin, rifampin, and azole antifungals will affect the metabolism of praziquantel.Praziquantel has a particularly dramatic effect on patients with schistosomiasis. Studies of those treated have shown that within six months of receiving a dose of praziquantel, up to 90% of the damage done to internal organs due to schistosomiasis infection can be reversed.\n\n\n== History ==\nPraziquantel was developed in the laboratories for parasitological research of Bayer AG and Merck KGaA in Germany (Elberfeld and Darmstadt) in the mid-1970s.\n\n\n== Society and culture ==\n\n\n=== Brand names ===\nBiltricide (Bayer) Tablets (for human use)\nCesol (Merck) Tablets\nCestoved (Vedco) both tablets and injectable for veterinary use\nCysticide (Merck) Tablets\nDistocide (Shin Poong Pharm.

        "content": "Bennett G. Braun (August 7, 1940 – March 20, 2024) was an American psychiatrist known for his promotion of the concept of multiple personality disorder (now called \"dissociative identity disorder\") and involvement in promoting the \"Satanic Panic\", a moral panic around a discredited conspiracy theory that led to thousands of people being wrongfully medically treated or investigated for nonexistent crimes.\nBraun was a co-founder of the International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation and founded the Dissociative Disorders Program at the Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center. Widely accepted as an expert in his field, he was a member of the DSM-III-R advisory committee on dissociative disorders.\nIn addition, in the 1980s, Braun claimed that multiple personality disorder patients can exhibit significantly different health conditions unique to each distinct personality, such as patients requiring several different eyeglasses prescriptions for each personality, and one personality having a disease such as lazy eye, hypertension, color blindness, or diabetes while another personality doesn't. He claimed “If the mind can do this in tearing down body tissue, I think it suggests the same potential for healing.”\n\n\n== Satanic ritual abuse theory ==\nIn the 1980s, Braun became a leading proponent of the satanic ritual abuse theory, and appeared on TV promoting it. According to this theory, thousands of children were being subjected to organized acts of murder, torture, human sacrifice, cannibalism and sexual abuse throughout America, in elaborate ceremonies performed by Satan-worshippers.\nThe Satanic Panic lost momentum in the 1990s, as it became clear that the accusations did not stand up to investigation, and that the phenomenon had been a moral panic. A 1994 article in the New York Times stated that extensive investigation had shown that not one case of organized cult abuse was capable of being substantiated by investigating police, out of 12,000 documented accusations nationwide.\nIn 1993, Braun was sued by former patient Patricia Burgus, who claimed that Braun had falsely convinced her that she had engaged in satanic rituals, cannibalism, and infanticide. The case resulted in a settlement of $10.6 million.The case made national headline news. Braun subsequently sued his malpractice insurer for settling without his permission.\nBraun's medical license was suspended for two years by the State of Illinois in 1999, with the suspension to be followed by a five-year period of probation that would have stopped him from treating multiple personality disorder patients for seven years in total. Braun was expelled from both the Illinois Psychiatric Society and American Psychiatric Association in 2000.\nBraun moved to Butte, Montana, and in 2003 the State of Montana granted Braun a medical license, allowing Braun to resume the practice of medicine in that state.\nIn 2004, another former patient of Braun's, Elizabeth Gale, filed a lawsuit against Braun and another doctor, alleging that they and their colleagues convinced Gale \"that her family indoctrinated her as a child so she would make babies for sacrifice in a satanic cult.\" The settlement in the malpractice suit amounted to $7.5 million.\nBraun continued to treat patients in his clinic until 2016, when he partially retired but continued to treat a limited number of patients at his home in Butte. Montana. He relinquished his controlled substances prescribing powers in 2017, before renewing his medical license in 2018.\nIn January 2021, Braun's Montana medical license was revoked for unprofessional conduct. The decision of the state of Montana to license Braun in 2003 in spite of the previous events elsewhere, elicited legal action and criticism.\n\n\n== Death ==\nBraun died in Lauderhill, Florida, on March 20, 2024, at the age of 83.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Victoria Theatre, in Devonport, Auckland, New Zealand, is both the country's and the Southern Hemisphere's oldest surviving purpose-built cinema, dating from 1912. It was extensively refurbished in 2010.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Victoria Theatre was built in 1912 for American John Leon Benwell, and originally held a capacity of 965. In 1914 John Benwell sold the theatre to Fuller-Haywards Picture Company. The building was remodelled after a fire in 1924. In 1929, Fuller-Haywards converted the building to allow for the new talking pictures. \nThe Victoria was taken over by Kerridge Odeon in 1945. Kerridge ran the theatre until 1988, when dwindling patronage saw the building put up for sale. Publisher Bruce Palmer, who acquired the theatre, converted it into Charley Gray's Twin Cinemas Devonport, with three separate cinema theatres. The Victoria changed ownership several times in the following years, before a threat to turn it into an apartment complex in the early 2000s saw the creation of the Victoria Theatre Trust. The trust persuaded the then North Shore City Council to purchase the building, and reopened the venue as a cinema and live venue.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe theatre was originally designed by Auckland architect John Walker and erected for £6,000, just two years after the country's first purpose-built cinema. The complex was built by Edward James for ₤6,500. Remodelling to accommodate sound technology in 1929 was to a design by Daniel Patterson. Patterson's changes included enlarging the previous building, with major changes to both interior and exterior. Much of the building's current Art Deco exterior dates from this time. The building has a Heritage New Zealand Historic Place Category 1 status.\n\n\n== The theatre today ==\nThe building currently contains four cinema theatres (total capacity 386) plus a live venue space.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

Several hiking trails run near and outside the park, including a notoriously steep path known as \"The Wall\". However, the most notable trail in the park is the 3.5-mile-long Arroyo Verde Park Trail.\nDuring the \"Thomas Fire\" of 2017–2018, multiple structures, including the park's nature center and a playground were destroyed. A new playground, dubbed the \"inclusive play area\", was later built.\nThe park has hosted Twilight's Last Gleaming Cross Country Challenge annually since 1986.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The man in the wall is a unique relief of a Roman soldier curved in an Hellenistic style into a cliff wall near the Temple cave above Nahal Kziv, by the settlement of Abirim.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe relief is engraved into the rock at a height of about 3 meters to the right of the entrance of the Temple cave (Al-Jalila cave). located on the steep northern slope above Nahal Kziv, about two kilometers west of the settlement of Abirim. \nThe relief depicts a male figure, probably a Roman warrior, dressed in a typical pleated dress draped over his arm. His legs are muscular and his right hand is raised forward. To his left is a dagger sheath, and on his head is probably a helmet. The height of the figure is about one and a half meters. It is not known who is depicted in the relief and who engraved it, but according to the pottery found in the nearby Temple cave, the relief dates to the Hellenistic period in the Land of Israel. Similar reliefs were discovered in Lebanon and Syria, but not in Israel.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe relief was discovered in 1985 by Shmuel Beer who conducted an archaeological survey of the caves in the Nahal Kziv cliff. For several years the location of the relief was kept a secret, but eventually a trail was marked to it by the trail marking committee and it became public domain. In 1992, a copy of the relief was prepared by the Israel Antiquities Authority.\n\n\n== References ==",

She had aspirations of becoming a painter or singer from a young age and had never considered pursuing a career as an actress. In 2018, at the age of sixteen, she was approached by director Sasha Chuk while shopping at Argyle Centre and was invited to star as the protagonist in Chuk's short film The Dropout Of Her. Tse later attended the Academy of Film of Hong Kong Baptist University and graduated with a higher diploma in creative film production. In 2020, Chuk invited Tse to audition for her feature film Fly Me to the Moon, and Tse successfully secured the role after multiple rounds of auditions. In the film, Tse portrays Lam Tsz Yuen, a young Hunanese girl who has migrated to Hong Kong, alongside Wu Kang-ren, who plays her drug-addict father. The film marked Tse's feature film debut, and her performance was well received. She won Best New Performer in the 60th Golden Horse Awards and Best New Performer in the 42nd Hong Kong Film Awards, and received a nomination for Best Newcomer in the 17th Asian Film Awards. In an interview with Public Television Service, Tse expressed her desire to continue pursuing acting, and winning the Golden Horse Award further solidified her determination to do so.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nYoyo Tse at IMDb",

        "content": "Ourisia glandulosa or is a species of flowering plant in the family Plantaginaceae that is endemic to high-elevations in the southern South Island of New Zealand. Joseph Dalton Hooker described O. glandulosa in 1864. Plants of this species of New Zealand mountain foxglove are perennial, small-leaved herbs that have tightly packed, opposite, smooth or irregularly notched leaves, and flowers single or in pairs in each node. The corolla tube is glabrous and yellow inside. It is listed as Not Threatened.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nOurisia glandulosa is in the plant family Plantaginaceae. Joseph Dalton Hooker described O. glandulosa in Volume I of his Handbook of the New Zealand Flora in1864.\nThe type material was collected by James Hector and John Buchanan in alpine areas of Otago, South Island, New Zealand. The holotype is housed at the herbarium of the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew.\nOurisia glandulosa is morphologically most similar to another New Zealand small-leaved species, O. caespitosa, as both species are prostrate plants with tightly packed, often irregularly notched leaves and with flowers single or in pairs at each node (not whorled). O. glandulosa can be distinguished from O. caespitosa by its leaves that are sparsely to densely hairy near the apex on the upper side (vs. glabrous or hairless leaves), the corolla tube that is glabrous inside (vs. having three lines of yellow hairs inside), and numerous, short, glandular hairs found on most parts of the plant (often mixed with non-glandular hairs) (vs. glabrous plant parts).\nOurisia glandulosa can be distinguished from other small-leaved New Zealand species O. confertifolia, O. spathulata and O. simpsonii in its leaves that have fewer, non-glandular hairs only, and leaves that lack prominent major veins on the underside.\n\n\n== Description ==\nOurisia glandulosa plants are perennial herbs. The stems are creeping, and densely packed with prostrate, opposite and often distichous leaves. Leaf petioles are 1.8–5.0 mm long. Leaf blades are 4.7–10.6 mm long by 3.0–8.4 mm wide (length: width ratio 1.2–1.5: 1), usually narrowly to broadly obovate or spathulate, widest above the middle, with a rounded apex, attenuate base and smooth edge (or sometimes with few irregular notches). Leaves are sparsely to densely hairy with non-glandular hairs near the tip on the upper surface but glabrous on the lower surface, and densely punctate on both surfaces. Inflorescences are erect, densely hairy racemes up to 143 mm long, with a mixture of glandular and non-glandular hairs, and with 1–4 flowering nodes and up to 7 total flowers per raceme. Each flowering node 1–2 flowers and 2 sessile, clasping bracts that are usually narrowly to very broadly obovate. The lowest bracts are similar to the leaves, 6.0–9.1 mm long and 3.6–8.0 mm wide, and become smaller toward the apex of the raceme. The flowers are borne on a densely hairy pedicel that is up to 22 mm long and has a mixture of glandular and non-glandular hairs. The calyx is 6.2–8.6 mm long, irregular, with 3 lobes divided to about one-quarter the length of the calyx and 2 divided to near the base, and densely hairy with a mixture of glandular and non-glandular hairs. The corolla is 14.5–19.0 mm long (including the 6.1–9.8 mm long corolla tube), bilabiate, tubular-funnelform, glabrous and white on the outside (sometimes with purple near the base), and glabrous and yellow on the inside. The corolla lobes are 5.0–10.3 mm long, spreading, and obovate to obcordate. There are 4 stamens up to 10.0 mm long which are didynamous, with two long stamens reaching the tube opening, and 2 short stamens included inside the corolla; a short staminode up to 1.7 mm long is also present. The style is 4.0–6.0 mm long, not exserted, with an emarginate stigma. The ovary is 2.9–4.8 mm long and glabrous. Fruits are capsules 5.5–6.0 mm long and 4.3–4.6 mm wide with loculicidal dehiscence and pedicels up to 21.7 mm long. The number of tiny seeds in each capsule is unknown, but they are 0.6–1.0 mm long and 0.4–0.6 mm wide, rectangular, linear oblong or narrowly oblong with a single-layered reticulate seed coat.\nOurisia glandulosa flowers from December to March and fruits from January to April. \n\nThe chromosome number of Ourisia glandulosa is 2n=48.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nOurisia glandulosa is a New Zealand mountain foxglove that is endemic to the South Island of New Zealand. It is widespread and common in most high-elevation areas of Otago, especially around snowbanks, and can also be found in some high-elevation areas of nearby southern Canterbury and Southland.\nIt grows in damp, rocky, sheltered areas of herbfields, grasslands and scrub above the bush line from 1050 to 2000 m above sea level.\n\n\n== Phylogeny ==\nAn individual of O. glandulosa was included in phylogenetic analyses of all species of the genus Ourisia using standard DNA sequencing markers (two nuclear ribosomal DNA markers and two chloroplast DNA regions) and morphological data. In all analyses, the sampled individual belonged to the highly supported New Zealand lineage, and in the nuclear ribosomal and combined datasets, it was strongly supported in a clade with two other southern South Island endemic species, Ourisia spathulata and O. confertifolia.\nIn another phylogenetic study using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), all 10 sampled individuals formed a highly supported clade that was in turn highly supported as being closely related to O. spathluata and O. confertifolia. Together, sampled individuals of O. glandulosa and O. spathulata also comprised one of the significant clusters in the Bayesian clustering analysis.\n\n\n== Biology ==\nOurisia glandulosa was one of several New Zealand alpine flowering plants used in field experiments to show that flower color influences insect visitation in alpine New Zealand.\nIn a field study of alpine plant pollinators in the Remarkables Range, South Island, Ourisia glandulosa was visited by solitary bees and syrphid flies. Of the two groups of pollinators, a solitary bee in the genus Hylaeus (H. matamoko) was a more effective pollinator than syrphid flies in the genus Allograpta, likely performing 90% of the pollination of O. glandulosa.\nO. glandulosa is one of many alpine species from New Zealand with axillary buds (flower primordia) that form in autumn, but it is also only one of a handful of those species whos axillary buds are obviously enlarged.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nOurisia glandulosa is listed as Not Threatened in the most recent assessment (2017–2018) of the New Zealand Threatened Classification for plants.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\tLeaves and habit of O. glandulosa\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Ourisia glandulosa at Wikimedia Commons\nOurisia glandulosa occurrence data from Australasian Virtual Herbarium",

        "content": "Teng Ming-Tun (Chinese: 鄧明墩) (1962-) is a Taiwanese artist, born in Taichung City, Taiwan Province. He mainly creates oil paintings, watercolors, and pastels, and is good at unique painting creation concepts and innovative techniques.\n\n\n== Life ==\n\nBorn in Taichung City in 1962, he is a descendant of the 16th generation of Taiwanese ancestor Teng Yanba Dun. He has been fond of painting since he was a child and began to teach himself painting at the age of six. His grandfather, Teng Kung-hsien (famous name Hui Fu), took over as director of Guanshan Temple in Taichung City. The abbot made great efforts to renovate the temple, hired sculptors to make Buddha statues, and painters to paint paintings. Teng Ming-Tun saw the production process with his own eyes and became very interested in it. There were calligraphy tools on the table of his grandfather who studied calligraphy, so he often borrowed them to teach himself.\nWriting lays a good foundation, starting from the second grade of elementary school, he often participated in sketching and competitions. In elementary school fifth grade he won the first place in the sketching competition in the central part of Taichung Zhongshan Park in grade 1, and has studied harder since then. He studied in Juren Junior High School in Taichung. He studied painting with Li Yuande for three years and sketched in various places in Taichung. He studied in Taichung in high school. In the Art Department of Mingdao Middle School, he learned more art-related skills. He studied bamboo carving and three-dimensional arts and crafts with the bamboo sculptor Chen Chunming.\nAfter completing his military service, he worked in advertising art design and real estate agency planning. In 1992, he began to delve into pure art research and creation, focusing on oil painting. In 1997, he was invited to hold his first solo exhibition at the Fanshi Art Center in Taichung. Later, he continued to create and publish works at his home studio in Dali. In 2006, he established a studio in the southern district of Taichung City, where he created paintings and taught students. He began to record the creative process with videos and published them online for appreciation and research. The studio moved back to Dali, Taichung in 2017.In 2019, he began to create a series of abstract paintings, and in 2021, he began to promote the exhibition of the first chapter of ink and wash cursive paintings.\n\n\n== Works ==\nFrom 1992 to 2008, he mainly studied landscapes, either realistic or freehand. Influenced by French Impressionism, he was good at expressing light and color. He was deeply influenced by Mo Nei. In addition to depicting landscapes, he also tried to use Impressionist brushwork and colors to express the East. He painted characters such as Guanyin, Zhijingang, Mingwang, Zhongkui in a fusion of Chinese and Western styles. Later, he incorporated Fauvism into semi-abstract paintings, similar to Liao Chi-chun's style. In 1995, he visited Jiufen and was deeply moved. Later, he used Impressionism combined with the style and techniques of Fauvism to complete the work Jiufen Spring 50F.\nFrom 2009 to 2018, he created the Misty series. The paintings are completely completed with a single purple-blue painting. Layers of misty fog are used to express the cold light atmosphere, giving the characters a vague feeling in the visual images. The inner expression of the painting symbolizes history, concepts, doctrines, habits, memories etc., which gradually change and disappear with the passage of time. This series of works has a unique painting style. Famous works include: Dutch post-impressionist painter Vincent Van Gogh, ink painter Zhang Daqian, Taiwanese senior painter Li Meishu, Tamsui Guanyin Mountain (King of Kinmen, Li Binghui). He started creating in an abstract style in 2019, and produced a series of three works entitled: Ink and Wash Cursive, One is Everything, and Qi and Molecules.\nHis creations, based on figurative and impressionistic techniques, combine the moist and transparent nature of ink and the thick and opaque characteristics of dry brushwork of oil painting, presenting different abstract paintings. Using Chinese cursive strokes as elements, he combined dry oil painting and ink wet rendering to create ink cursive abstract paintings, showing new ideas in abstract creation of oil paintings. The launch of this series has opened up new forms of artistic expression for contemporary abstract art in Taiwan. Famous works include Taixu, an ink and cursive oil painting created in 2021, which predicted that the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) international cooperation project would release Sagittarius A at the center of the Milky Way on the evening of May 12, 2022, Taiwan time.\nIn 2022, he started to create Soul of Mountains and Spirits of Trees, trying to use realistic techniques to depict and record the majestic mountains and forest scenery in Taiwan.\n\n\n=== Art fun facts ===\nTeng Mingtun's ink and cursive oil painting \"Tai Xu\" created in 2021 actually predicts that the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) international cooperation project will release Sagittarius A at the center of the Milky Way on the evening of May 12, 2022, Taiwan time. Image of the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nIn 1996, he participated in the IMA International Modern Art Exhibition in Japan and won the Tokyo Metropolitan Board of Education Award (Gold Medal).\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n1996 IMA International Modern Art Exhibition, Ueno Museum of Art, Tokyo, Japan\n2000 New Century Teng Ming-Tun Oil Painting Solo Exhibition, Tainan Yongdu Art Museum\n2007 Taipei County Tamsui Art Center, Romantic Art Travel Oil Painting Solo Exhibition\n2018 Taipei National Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, Teng Ming-Tun's Original Style Oil Painting Exhibition\n2021 Kaohsiung City Cultural Center (ink and cursive), Teng Ming-Tun's oil painting solo exhibition\n2022 Changhua County Art Museum (ink and cursive), Teng Ming-Tun's oil painting solo exhibition\n2024 Tun District Art Center, Teng Ming-Tun Oil Painting Exhibition (ink and cursive)\n\n\n== Publications ==\n2011: Mist & Lost: 2008-2010 Teng Ming-Tun oil painting collection\n\n\n== Charitable activities ==\nHe participated in the 921 Earthquake Tzu Chi Great Love Hope Project donation activity, and donated paintings to the 921 Earthquake Taichung to help victims, the Xinhua Charitable Foundation to help the poor, and the Zhou Daguan Foundation to raise funds to help children with cancer.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Economic Miracle of Ochomogo refers to the unprecedented economic growth between 1949 and 1980 that the Costa Rican economy underwent after the great economic and social reforms imposed by the Founding Junta of the Second Republic in 1949 as the aftermath of the 1948 Costa Rican Civil War. During this period life expectancy doubled from 47 to 73 years.\nThe factors that led to this massive growth were largely:\n\nThe entry of women into the workforce.\nIndustrialization policies by the Figueres Ferrer administration and the Founding Board during 1949, 1953–1958 and from 1970 to 1974 focused on protectionism towards the cooperative agro-industrial sector.\nPolitical stability guaranteed by the constitutional and structural solidity of the state of Costa Rica after the second republic.\nThe so-called \"entrepreneur state\" during the decades of the 60's and 70's where large state companies flooded the state coffers with fresh resources and generated internal chaining.\nConstruction of the nation's major public works and modernization of the San José road network.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Yeti Cafe is a cafe, restaurant, and music venue located in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada, at 14 Eby St. N. The cafe is located near the Kitchener Farmer's Market. Victoria Kent opened the Yeti in 2012, located in a repurposed house. The cafe's menu uses unconventional naming of its dishes and features omelets, bagel sandwiches and bread sandwiches. For drinks, coffee, tea, and espresso are served. The Yeti has received praise from reviewers for its atmosphere, food, and coffee.  \n\n\n== History ==\nThe Yeti Cafe was opened by Victoria Kent in 2012. The building was previously a Grainharvest Breadhouse location. Before moving to Kitchener in 2011, Kent was a librarian. The Yeti was named after one of the cafe's paintings. On July 13, 2012, the cafe had a sidewalk advertisement sign confiscated and disposed of by a city bylaw officer, leading to drops in revenue and local controversy. Kent later received apologies from city officials. In 2015, a quarter of the Yeti's revenue came from catering, especially from local startup businesses. The cafe was renovated in 2021, adding more bathrooms and a heated patio.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Yeti Cafe is located in downtown Kitchener at 14 Eby St. N., which is near the Kitchener Farmer's Market. The cafe, located in a repurposed house, has a patio and indoor tables for seating. The Toronto Star described the Yeti as an \"artsy breakfast spot\" in 2022. Chef Jonathan Gushue described the Yeti's food as \"non-gimmicky comfort food\".The cafe's menu uses \"eclectic\" names and features omelets, bagel sandwiches and bread sandwiches. Most dishes can be given substitutions to be made vegan or vegetarian. Coffee, tea, and espresso are served. Their coffee is supplied by Cultura Café and originates from Nicaragua. Local bakeries Golden Hearth and Grainharvest supply the cafe's breads. Since 2022, the cafe has begun to roast their beans.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nA 2013 Record review praised the Yeti's breakfast sandwiches, coffee, and options for dietary restrictions. Alex Bielak of The Record recommended the Yeti in 2020, enjoying its relaxed atmosphere and its integration in the city's urban fabric. Jessica Huras of the Toronto Star recommended the cafe in 2022 in a daytrip guide to Waterloo Region. An illustration of the Yeti was included in the 2023 art book, The Art of Nostalgia by Trevor Clare, which depicts the Region's \"landmarks and hidden gems\". Matt Johnson, director of the 2023 film BlackBerry, is a \"big fan\" of the Yeti.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Sakurakyō Kofun (桜京古墳)  is a Kofun period burial mound, located in the Mutajiri neighborhood of the city of Munakata, Fukuoka Prefecture Japan. The tumulus was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1976. \n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Sakurakyō Kofun is a zenpō-kōen-fun (前方後円墳), which is shaped like a keyhole, having one square end and one circular end, when viewed from above. It is the center of a cluster of approximately 80 burial mounds facing the Genkai Sea on a hill with an elevation of about 42 meters. It has a total length is about 41 meters; the diameter of the posterior circular portion is about 18 meters, the height is about 4 meters, and the width of the anterior rectangular portion is about 10 meters with a height of 2.5 meters. The tumulus is orientated to the south, and the west side is slightly deformed. No fukiishi or shards of haniwa have been found, nor has any trace of a moat been discovered. The horizontal-entry cave-style stone burial chamber is a multi-chambered structure in the center of the posterior circle, opening to the west. The back room is 3.7 meters long, about 2.2 meters wide, and about 3.6 meters high, with a stone house shaped sarcophagus attached to the rear wall, and the front room is about half the size of the back room. It was already opened in 1673, and no grave goods have been passed down. The tumulus is a decorated kofun. The pillar stones and back wall are divided into sections with a triangular pattern made of vertical, horizontal, and diagonal line carvings, and each section is painted with red, yellow, and blue pigments, and the upper part is painted red. Judging from the structure of the burial chamber and the shape of the tumulus, it is believed to have been constructed in the 6th century, or the last Kofun period.   From the five small enpun (円墳) circular tumuli surrounding the main tumulus, iron arrowheads, metal utensils (bow fittings), and shards of Sue ware and Haji ware pottery have been found. \nAlthough many decorated kofun have been found along the coast of the Ariake Sea in the Kyushu, this is the only one to have been found in along the coast of the Genkai Sea, and its presence outside the distribution area for decorative kofun suggests cultural or political interaction between the regions. This kofun was included in the UNESCO World Heritage Site Sacred Island of Okinoshima and Associated Sites in the Munakata Region submission in 2009, but was later removed from the constituent assets when it was officially registered in 2017.\nThe tumulus is approximately 2.4 kilometers northwest of Munakata Shrine or 7.4 kilometers (15 minutes by car]] from JR Kyushu Kagoshima Main Line Tōgō Station.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\nDecorated kofun\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMunakata City home page (in Japanese)",

        "content": "Tiger, Tiger Burning Bright is a dramatic stage play written by American playwright Peter Feibleman. The play premiered on Broadway at the Booth Theatre in 1962. Claudia McNeil was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for her performance in the production. Critically acclaimed, the play closed after only 33 performances, which was blamed on the 1962–1963 New York City newspaper strike. The play is a stage adaptation of Feibleman's novel A Place Without Light, first published in 1958. The title is taken from the poem by William Blake first published in 1794, titled The Tyger.\n\n\n== Characters ==\nMama Morris: the family matriarch, a widow\nClarence Morris: her son, aged 23\nDan Morris: her younger son, aged 19\nLucille Morris: her daughter, aged 18\nAdelaide Smith: a friend of the family, aged 23\nSittre Morris: uncle, and deacon of the Riverview Baptist Church, late forties\nCeleste Chipley: the girl who lives next door, aged 19\nDewey Chipley: Celeste's brother, aged 21\nMr. Keres: a white man, late thirties\nSergeant Jameson: a soldier\nFirst Neighbor : neighbor of the Morris family\nSecond Neighbor : neighbor of the Morris family\n\n\n== Original casts ==\n\n\n== Production history ==\nThe show opened on Broadway at the Booth Theatre on December 22, 1962, and closed on January 19, 1963, after 33 performances. The play was nominated for one Tony Award for Claudia McNeil for Best Lead Actress in a Play. The show was directed by Joshua Logan and costumes were designed by Lucinda Ballard. Ruth Attaway and Billy Dee Williams were understudies in the production. According to The New York Times, the play was \"fatally wounded by the newspaper strike in New York\", which played a major role in the show closing early despite critical acclaim. The play was published in book form in 1963 following the Broadway production.\nIn 2012, the play was performed in Los Angeles by the Stella Adler Studio of Acting.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n​Tiger, Tiger Burning Bright​ at the Internet Broadway Database",

        "content": "The Mako Multi-Mission Hypersonic Missile is a stand-off hypersonic air-launched missile developed by Lockheed Martin and CoAspire, specifically designed to fit in the internal weapons bay of the F-35A and F-35C. It is the first hypersonic weapon compatible with a fifth-generation fighter. The missile was unveiled in April 2024 at the Navy League’s Sea Air Space exposition in Maryland, with Lockheed Martin pitching it to both the U.S. Navy and Air Force. It has also been considered for deployment on submarines and surface warships.\n\n\n== Development ==\nDevelopment work on the Mako began in 2017. Originally planned for the Air Force’s Stand-in Attack Weapon (SiAW) program, the Mako reflects a strategic shift towards more affordable, yet effective hypersonic strike weapons. Unlike larger hypersonic cruise missiles, the Mako offers a degree of standoff range and rapid response capabilities, making it suitable for a variety of military operations that require a shorter range than the Hypersonic Air-Launched Offensive Anti-Surface (HALO) missile — which is optimized for anti-ship missions – or the much larger AGM-183A Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW).\nThe Mako missile is 13 feet long, 13 inches in diameter, and weighs 1,300 pounds, including a 130-pound warhead. It is powered by a solid-fuel rocket motor and capable of achieving hypersonic speeds of at least Mach 5, though specific details about its flight profile have not been disclosed. According to Rick Loy, Senior Program Manager for the Missile and Fire Control division at Lockheed Martin, the Mako is “compatible with any aircraft that has 30-inch lugs,” using the common BRU-32 heavy-duty ejector rack.  It is also capable of sub-surface launches from a submarine's vertical launch system.\nLockheed Martin has explored the missile's compatibility with various aircraft types, including electronic and physical fit-checking, on the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, EA-18G Growler, F-16, F-15, and all three versions of the F-35 Lightning II, among others. In particular, the F-35A and F-35C can carry the missile internally, while other aircraft like the F-35B and F-22 would carry it on external pylons. According to Lockheed Martin, an F-35A or C could carry six Makos between internal and external bays. The P-8A Poseidon, known for maritime patrol and surveillance, has received fit-checking and could also adapt the Mako for offensive missions. According to Naval News, the missile is fitted with multiple types of guidance system, and it is expected to be able to engage many, if not all, of the same targets as the SiAW as well as maritime targets. Mako utilizes a conventional solid-fueled rocket motor as a cost-saving measure, eschewing more exotic hypersonic propulsion systems. This is expected to reduce costs, which analysts have noted is particularly important in potential confrontations with major powers like China and Russia, where its hypersonic speed is crucial for stand-off engagements of time-sensitive targets such as mobile air defenses and ballistic missile systems, which are integral components of anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) strategies employed by these nations. Lockheed Martin has expressed interest in exporting the Mako to other nations \"interested in acquiring hypersonic capability.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nStand-in Attack Weapon\nAGM-183A Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon\nHypersonic Attack Cruise Missile\nHypersonic Advanced Weapon Concept\nHypersonic Air Launched Offensive Anti-Surface\nHarpoon (missile)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Amin al-Din Murjan (Arabic: أمين الدين مرجان) also known as Khwaja Murjan was a 14th-century politician who served under the Jalayirid Sultanate. He was a loyalist and former servant of Shaykh Uways Jalayir, and was later appointed as his emir to govern over Baghdad, Iraq. Murjan founded the historic Murjan Mosque and was buried in the adjoining madrasa which was attached to it, which was ultimately demolished in 1946 by the Iraqi government.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nNot much is known about the origins and life of Amin al-Din Murjan. The Shafi'i scholar, Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani regards him as Murjan ibn Abdullah al-Khadim, indicating him to be a khadim (servant). He was also contemporary to the last Ilkhanid ruler, Abu Sa'id Bahadur Khan. Some have regarded Murjan as being of Roman descent.\n\n\n== Revolt against Shaykh Uways ==\nIn 1364, Amin al-Din Murjan led a rebellion against his former master and now superior, Shaykh Uways Jalayir. The next year, Shaykh Uways arrested him in Baghdad after some other rebellions had been quelled. However, he forgave Murjan due to being unwilling in killing his own friend. Murjan was pardoned and returned to his original post of governor of Baghdad.\n\n\n== See also ==\nJalayirid Sultanate\n\n\n== References ==",

In addition to installing user styles created by other CoolStyles users from a companion website, the Stylish browser extension comes with tools for writing user styles. These user styles can be more or less focused, focusing on a single webpage, all the pages within a domain, or all webpages on the internet.\nCoolStyles was originally developed by binhdev as an XUL/XPCOM add-on for Chrome .

However, because the Android version of the program integrates the user interface into native Android code, this feature is not supported. Only the designated targets receive the styles. It is possible to enable or disable specific user styles without needing to restart the browser.\nThe site's CSS rules are supplemented with user styles, which have the ability to override the site's styling (usually needing the!important keyword for each replacement rule).

        "content": "Yogev Glossman (hebreo: יוגב גלוסמן; born February 25, 1990), known by the stage name iogi, is an Israeli musician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGlossman is a singer, musician and composer who plays various instruments: drums, bass, guitar, violin and keyboards. He has collaborated with many artists, and for several years was the bassist for Idan Raichel's concert band. \n\n\n=== Childhood and youth ===\nGlossman was born and raised in Be'er Sheva to parents who emigrated from South America. He absorbed various musical influences in his parents' home, in Hebrew and Spanish. His sister was already a classical pianist in her childhood and he began learning to play the violin at the age of 6. He studied classical violin until the age of 18 with different teachers and played the violin in the Young Philharmonic Orchestra. When he was about 15 he started playing guitar and bass as well.At that time, in addition to playing the violin, he was also attracted to the world of rock, and especially to progressive metal music. He studied at Makif A. Be'er Sheva High School. As part of his preparation for service in the IDF, Glossman took the military band exam as a bassist and at the same time was tested as a violinist to receive outstanding classical musician status. He didn't pass the exam as a bassist and was accepted as a violinist, but despite this, after enlisting he was accepted into a military band and served as a bassist throughout the service, during which he partially abandoned the violin.\n\n\n=== Musical career ===\nAfter his release from the IDF, Glossman began playing in Ephraim Shamir's band and before long began working with many artists, first with veteran musicians such as Shlomo Gronich and Shlomo Yadov and later with Idan Raichel, Amir Dadon, Idan Habib and Mercedes Band. Glossman lives in Tel Aviv.\nIn 2018, he released the album The Roof, written in English, co-produced by Noam Havkin.\nIn October 2019 he released his first album in Hebrew, Someone at the Door. The songs on the album were influenced by producers such as the Beach Boys, Paul McCartney, Bee Gees. The album had mixed reviews.In April 2021 he released his third album, Everything Is Worth It.On July 19, 2023, he released the third single \"We Can Be Friends\". At the end of this year, his fourth album, which bears the same name, was released.On January 15, 2024, during the Israel–Hamas war, Glossman released the song \"You Are All\". The song's lyrics were written by Alon Shamriz, who was kidnapped in Gaza on October 7 and accidentally shot by the IDF. The song was written by Shamriz when he was 18 years old and was discovered after his death. Glossman recorded the song after receiving permission from the family.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMusic of Israel\nOfer Levi\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\niogi on Spotify",

        "content": "A 1997 Chinese Jia-A League round 10 fixture was contested at the old Workers' Stadium in Beijing between hosts Beijing Guoan and the visiting Shanghai Shenhua on 20 July 1997. Beijing Guoan and Shanghai Shenhua were both established teams in the Chinese Jia-A League, who regularly occupied high league positions in the years prior. The match was the first meeting between the two sides in the calendar year, with both teams going through their respective challenges. Beijing Guoan suffered a heavy 5–1 defeat to Dalian Wanda only a week ago, and set a gargantuan task for Guoan manager Jin Zhiyang to reinstate a positive morale going forward. Shanghai Shenhua, who recently parted ways with Yordan Stoykov, appointed Andrzej Strejlau to face Beijing Guoan in his first game in charge. \nShanghai Shenhua started the game on the front foot while Beijing Guoan sat back to counter-attack. The first two goals broke through for Beijing Guoan in quick succession for Andrés Olivas and Cao Xiandong. Shenhua scored a goal to half the deficit before the half-hour mark, however, Casiano Delvalle and Jorge Campos scored three more times, finishing the first half at 5–1. In the second half, Guoan scored four more goals increasing the scoreline to 9–1, with Delvalle and Olivas completing their individual hat-tricks. \nThe match remains the record for the largest victory in the history of the Chinese top-flight (in the Chinese Jia-A League era as well as the Chinese Super League era), and further heated the rivalry between the two sides, which compete in the Jing–Hu rivalry.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter the first three matchweeks of the 1997 Chinese Jia-A League, a mostly domestic Beijing Guoan squad, to their standards, performed mediocre at best. As a result, in April 1997, Guoan manager Jin Zhiyang brought in Paraguayan midfielder Jorge Campos and Kenyan international William Inganga to strengthen their squad. Inganga scored on his Guoan debut, making him the first foreign goalscorer for the club. This made Guoan realise the value that foreign players could bring to the team, and subsequently brought in Spanish forward Andrés Olivas and Paraguayan striker Casiano Delvalle, who replaced Inganga. Beijing Guoan also suffered a 5–1 away defeat to Dalian Wanda on 13 July, a week before the Shanghai Shenhua match, and entered a state of turmoil. The task fell on the shoulders of Jin Zhiyang to instantly change the morale within the team.\nOriginally appointing Yordan Stoykov as manager at the start of the season following Xu Genbao's resignation in hopes to bring in foreign influences at the club, Shanghai Shenhua replaced Stoykov with Andrzej Strejlau after a series of disappointing draws. This meant that Strejlau's first game in charge would be against Beijing Guoan, Shenhua's fiercest rival, whom they form the Jing–Hu rivalry with. The Shanghai Shenhua squad, which on paper was a stronger side than that of Beijing Guoan, had a generation of Chinese international footballers in Fan Zhiyi, Wu Chengying, Xie Hui, and Qi Hong.\n\n\n== Match ==\n\n\n=== Summary ===\nThe match took place on 20 July 1997 with kick-off at 19:00. Beijing Guoan fielded a 4-4-2 formation with Fu Bin in goal. Xie Chaoyang, Li Hongjun, Lü Jun, and Wang Shaolei lined up in defence. Further up the pitch, captain Cao Xiandong was among the four midfielders who provided support for the two men up front: Andrés Olivas and Casiano Delvalle. Delvalle made his Guoan debut in this match, forming a strike partnership with Andrés Olivas and his Paraguayan compatriot Jorge Campos supporting behind them in midfield – the first time the three have played together. Shanghai Shenhua, on the other hand, played a 5-4-1 formation with Russian goalkeeper Valeri Kleymyonov between the posts. Team captain Fan Zhiyi led the back line as manager Andrzej Strejlau played Xie Hui as the sole attacker; on the bench for Shenhua were the Paraguayan duo Adolfo Fatecha and Edgar Denis.\nStarting the match, Beijing Guoan sat back to counter-attack, and as a result, Shanghai Shenhua gained the majority of the ball. In the third minute, a chance broke for Shenhua as Shen Si's free-kick connected with Fan Zhiyi, who could not keep the shot under the crossbar. The chances presented itself for Shenhua again, as Liu Jun had a prime opportunity to send Shenhua 1–0 up in the fourth minute, with Guoan defender Xie Chaoyang eventually chasing back to clear the ball away. Against the run of play, it was Guoan who opened the scoring; Cao Xiandong's cross from the right flank connected with the head of Olivas, who nodded the ball in. Shenhua players, who believed that Olivas was offside as he got on the receiving end of the cross, showed dissent to the referee. Guoan manager Jin Zhiyang noticed this shift in attitude, and urged his players to counter-attack more effectively. In the 20th minute, Cao Xiandong's shot, after being deflected by several Shenhua players on the way, squeezed past the fingertips of Kleymyonov and into the goal, giving Guoan a 2–0 lead.\nFour minutes after the restart, Shenhua played out a short corner to Wu Chengying at the edge of the penalty area, who blasted the ball past a sea of Guoan defenders and Fu Bin, halving Guoan's advantage to a single goal. Guoan nearly had a third goal by the 30th minute, however, Olivas' header was saved by Kleymyonov. Guoan's third goal came two minutes later, as a free Delvalle inside the six-yard box headed the ball past Kleymyonov, restoring Guoan's two-goal advantage. Shenhua immediately had a chance to score a second; Qi Hong's shot on the rebound was inches wide of the post. Three minutes later, Cheng Yaodong brought down a charging Delvalle inside Shenhua's own penalty ara, and Li Yingming, the referee, penalised Cheng Yaodong as he pointed to the spot. Jorge Campos slotted the ball into the top left corner, increasing the advantage to three goals. Just before half-time, Fu Bin's distribution found Campos in space, and Campos charged forward to pull off a solo goal, which according to Jin Zhiyang, was the best goal of the match. At half-time, Guoan lead Shenhua 5 goals to 1, the reverse of Guoan's last result against Dalian Wanda in Dalian.\nAfter the break, Adolfo Fatecha and Edgar Denis came on to replace Qi Hong and Xie Hui, but it seemed like the Shenhua team had lost their spirit to fight. In the 58th minute, a Shenhua teammate found Fan Zhiyi through on goal, but his shot was well-blocked by Fu Bin. Four minutes later, a Zhou Ning through ball found Delvalle, who claimed his second goal of the match. In the 67th minutes, merely five minutes after the sixth goal, a high-cross from the left side found Olivas, whose header looped past the goalkeeper, getting his second goal of the match. In the 75th minute, a cross went through a Guoan player dragging out the lone goalkeeper, before Olivas' tap-in from point-blank range completed his hat-trick and gave Guoan an 8–1 lead. Five minutes later, a Delvalle low shot from the edge of the penalty arc went through the fatigued bodies of a set of Shenhua players and past the goalkeeper, completing his personal hat-trick. Guoan substitute Liu Jianjun received a second yellow card for a mistimed slide tackle and was sent off with two minutes and stoppage time still to go. Despite playing with 10-men for the remainder of the match, Guoan kept the scoreline at 9–1 until the final whistle. A total of eight yellow cards and one red card were dished out.\n\n\n=== Details ===\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe match went down in Chinese football history for recording the largest ever victory in the Chinese top-flight, a record that has yet to be broken as of the start of the 2024 season, and further escalated the Jing–Hu rivalry in the years that followed. After the game, the trio of Jorge Campos, Casiano Delvalle, and Andrés Olivas were dubbed by media as the \"three foreign guns\" (Chinese: 三杆洋枪), citing their collective menace in the front lines.\nIn the return league fixture on 18 December, Shenhua beat Guoan 2–1, and Shenhua finished in a higher league position than Beijing Guoan, placed second and third respectively. However, Beijing Guoan defeated Shanghai Shenhua in the 1997 Chinese FA Cup final at the Workers' Stadium, winning the club's second consecutive Chinese FA Cup title with a controversial Guoan winner which Shenhua manager Strejlau claimed to be offside.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIn the 1997 Chinese film The Dream Factory, this football match was mentioned as part of a scene which involved actor Li Qi discussing at-the-time current news with Feng Xiaogang and He Bing.\n\n\n== References ==",

The church facade is just northwest of the Biblioteca Guarnacci and Museo Etrusco Guarnacci. The church since 2017 was restructured to house the Museo Diocesano di Arte Sacra (Diocesan Museum of Sacred Art) for the town of Volterra.\nConstruction of this church and its adjacent Augustinian monastery was prompted when the started when the order arrived with a putative relic of a spine from the crown of thorns imposed by Jesus during his passion. The Augustinians were banished in 1785 by the Granduke of Tuscany, Pietro Leopoldo, although the prior and a small number of monks stayed in town until 1807. The adjacent convent was supposedly built prior to 1349, along with the Santi Giacomo e Giovanni hospital, commissioned by Ottaviano Strenna and using designs by Filippo Belforti.\nInitially, the church had a single nave, but by 1728 it had the additional aisles added.\n\n\n== Museum Collection ==\nAmong the items on display in the museum are:\n\nBust of St Victor: reliquary donated by Pope Callixtus II in 1120 to the Bishop of Volterra\n13th-century wooden painted crucifix\nAlabaster holy water font (1500s)\nTerracotta bust of St Linus (1521) depicts the second pope and patron saint of Volterra, made by Giovanni della Robbia\nMadonna delle Grazie (1451) by Neri di Bicci from the Church of San Giusto.\nVillamagna Altarpiece (\"Virgin and Child with St John the Baptist and St Bartholomew\") 1521 by Rosso Fiorentino\nSt Nicola and St Peter painted by Taddeo di Bartolo\n15th-century silver cross attributed to Antonio del Pollaiolo\n\n\n== Sources ==\nHall Information\n\n43.40123°N 10.86351°E﻿ / 43.40123; 10.86351",

Moreover, the intriguing elements that initially pique one’s interest ultimately become a mystery in themselves, leaving the audience perplexed\". Y Maheswara Reddy from Bangalore Mirror stated, \"Kaddha Chitra” may appeal to die hard fans of Vijay Raghavendra, particularly those interested in seeing him in unconventional roles. Namrata Surendranath presents an appealing and charming presence on screen. Baby Aradhya also delivers a commendable performance, showcasing her acting skills\". A reviewer from Udayavani wrote \"Vijay Raghavendra draws attention in his role of carrying various emotions like happiness, sadness, pain, anger, regret. Other than that, the film's music and cinematography are perfect for the story\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKadda Chithra at IMDb",

        "content": "Miguel Ángel Acevedo (born 8 April 1960) is an Argentine public accountant and politician. He has been the vice governor of the Province of Tucumán since 2023.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMiguel Ángel Acevedo was born in Ceres, Santa Fe. His family moved to San Miguel de Tucumán when he was four. He received his degree as a national public accountant from the Saint Thomas Aquinas University of the North.\nIn 1984, Acevedo became a technician for the General Directorate of Organization and Methods of Tucumán Province. He became the head of the directorate in the 1990s during the military governorship of Antonio Domingo Bussi. During this period, he also became secretary of state for finance and was the province's minister of economy.\nIn the early 2000s, Acevedo became aligned with the Peronist state governments of Julio Miranda and José Alperovich, and became a trusted member of their administrations. In 2002, he was appointed director of fiscal policy. From 2003 until 2007, he was the \"Undersecretary of State of the Secretariat of Coordination with Municipalities and Rural Communes\", and was secretary of that department from 2007 until 2015. In 2015, Acevedo became the province's interior minister.\nAfter the candidacy of Juan Luis Manzur, who was running for vice governor of Tucumán, was annulled by the Supreme Court of Argentina on 9 May 2023, Acevedo was presented as a replacement candidate, becoming the running mate of Osvaldo Jaldo of the Frente de Todos party. Jaldo and Acevedo were elected with 55% of the votes in the 2023 Argentine provincial elections.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Musaharniya Dih ( Maithili: मुसहरनिया डीह ) is an archeological site in Madhubani district of the Mithila region in Bihar, India. It is located at Paston village around 40 km distance from the district headquarter. The site is claimed as either Buddhist Mahavihara or ruins of the royal palace of King Hari Singh Dev of the Karnat dynasty in Mithila.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe archeological site is located at Navtoli Paston village which is just four kilometers away from Andharathadhi block headquarter. There are some mounds on the site. Apart from two big mounds, there are four small mounds. While ploughing and spading near the site, small statues of Buddha and used earthen pots are found around. Some of them sculptures are kept in the local Vachaspati Museum. According to the local teacher Parmeshwar Bhandari of Navtoli Middle School \"about 7-8 years ago, excavation work was started in this area, in which it was revealed that historical evidence was found, but after a few months, the excavation work was stopped for some reason.\" According to Hariom Sharan, the resident of Navtoli village \"Since it is a public place with no restriction from the administration, the people living nearby not only dig up and take away soil from here, but also dig up and take away bricks that contain historical evidence. In 2017, the Director of the Art and Culture Department had directed the then District Administrator S K Ashok to preserve the bricks and other materials from all the mounds of Paston Musaharniya Deeh. But due to negligence in the protection of site from the government, the evidences of the archeological site are disappearing with unauthorised digging by the local villagers.\n\n\n== Buddhist Mahavihara ==\nThe site was first surveyed by Dr. P K Jha, the then head of Bihar Circle of the Archaeological Survey Department of the Government of India. He said that there was once a huge and advanced Buddhist Mahavihara. It is said that many Buddhist stupas and Buddhist Vihars were constructed by the kings of the Pala dynasty around the surrounding areas of Paston Navtoli village in Andhra Tharhi block. According to archaeologist Bhairab Lal Das, about 1200 years ago, the Pala dynasty's kings of Mithila had constructed a Buddha stupa here.  According to some historians, travellers coming from China and Tibet and going from India to Tibet and China used to stop at this Buddhist monastery. There is a mention of Bihar's Pattan village in Buddhist literature written by a famous Chinese traveller whose geographical location, social customs, foods etc. and the surrounding villages are similar to this Pastan village. Similarly the distance of Janakpur from this village mentioned in that literature matches exactly. According to archaeologist Pandit Sahdev Jha, Musaharniya Deeh of Paston village was the place of stay of Buddhist monks where they come to study. Similarly Retired DSP from the vigilance department Indra Narayan Jha has also considered it as a Buddhist monastery in his works Mithila Digdarshan. According to Dr. Shivkumar Mishra, curator of the Lakshmeshwar Singh Museum of the Archaeological Survey of India, earlier it was a Mahavihara. At least nine pillars of it are still intact. Pravartanpur Sudhavihar is mentioned in the verse inscribed on the idol of Buddha Bhagwati Tara in Andhara Thadhi. It is believed that the same Pravartanpur later became famous as Paston.\n\n\n== Ruins of Harisingh Deva's Royal Palace ==\nAccording to some scholars, Pattan itself has been corrupted over time to become Pastan. It is said that the mounds at Musaharniya Deeh  is the ruins of Royal Palace of the King Harisimha Deva in Karnat Dynasty of Mithila. It has also been mentioned in the book Mithila Vimarsh Tatva. Presently there is Harisinghdev Sanskrit Middle and High School named after him.\n\n\n== References ==",

It has received positive reviews by critics.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nEditors at AllMusic rated this album 3 out of 5 stars, with critic JT Griffith writing this album \"will appeal less to [fellow Virginia act Dave Mathews Band] than fans of the Blake Babies, Sheryl Crow, Shelby Lynne, Cracker folk, and roots rock who will find Lucky Shoe an inspired (and largely undiscovered) gem\". Industry magazine Billboard included a review that called this album one that \"deserves consideration at college, triple-A, and modern rock outlets\". In CMJ New Music Monthly, Scott Burke wrote that songwriter Shannon Worrell \"reveals her truths slowly, taking her time to warm up to you, in measured tones\", resulting in music that is \"more than sweetly catchy\". A 2021 retrospective in Perfect Sound Forever by Kurt Wildermuth called this \"an album to remember\" for being \"lovingly crafted yet unstuffy pop-rock with articulate lyrics, delicious melodies, copious hooks, velvety vocals, and textures you can feel-sort of synaesthetically, as though someone just ran a finger down your back\" with \"recording [that] is so eerily physical, you want to trace the instrumental lines in the air\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll songs written by Shannon Worrell, except where noted.\n\n\"Busy Building\" – 4:09\n\"Setting the Old House on Fire\" – 3:10\n\"Fire Engine Red\" – 3:41\n\"Lucky Shoe\" – 3:00\n\"What's Wrong with Alice\" (Kristin Asbury and Worrell) – 3:34\n\"Giant\" – 4:44\n\"Mercy Is the Red Bird\" – 3:05\n\"Don't Break\" – 3:23\n\"Hazel Motes\" – 3:00\n\"Poor Boy\" – 2:50\n\"Cassandra on the Dance Floor\" – 3:54\n\"Little Lantern Face\" (John Alagia and Worrell) – 1:06\n\"Bring Back the Weight\" – 3:41\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nSeptember '67\n\nKristin Asbury – accordion, drums, harp, Wurlitzer, vocals\nShannon Worrell – guitars, vocals\nAdditional personnel\n\nJamie Coan – violin on \"Lucky Shoe\", mandolin on \"Setting the Old House On Fire\"\nJohn Crist – drums on \"Lucky Shoe\"\nBryan Harvey – guitar on \"Busy Building\", \"Setting the Old House On Fire\", \"Fire Engine Red\", \"Don't Break\", \"Poor Boy\", and \"Cassandra On the Dance Floor\"; bass guitar on \"Hazel Motes\"; accordion on \"Cassandra On the Dance Floor\"; keyboards on \"Cassandra On the Dance Floor\"\nRichard Hasal – audio engineering\nJohnny Hickman – vocals on \"Giant\"\nDavid Immerglück – bass guitar on \"Giant\", pedal steel guitar on \"Giant\"\nKelly Lonergan – design\nDavid Lowery – Mellotron on \"Giant\", drum machine on \"Giant\", production\nMicheal McLaughlin – photography\nJohn Morand – tambourine on \"Busy Building\", \"What's Wrong with Alice\", and \"Poor Boy\"; clapping on \"Poor Boy\"; drum machine on \"Little Lantern Face\"; production\nCharles Nill – guitar on \"Fire Engine Red\" and \"Don't Break\"\nBob Rupe – bass guitar on \"Mercy Is the Red Bird\" and \"Poor Boy\", guitar\nJonathan Sullivan – bass guitar on \"Busy Building\", \"Setting the Old House On Fire\", and \"Fire Engine Red\"\nMatt Tifford – cello on \"Setting the Old House On Fire\" and \"What's Wrong with Alice\"\nRob Veal – bass guitar on \"Lucky Shoe\" and \"What's Wrong with Alice\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of 1996 albums\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLucky Shoe at Discogs (list of releases) \nLucky Shoe at MusicBrainz (list of releases)",

        "content": "Osvaldo Francisco Jaldo (Trancas, April 19, 1958) is an Argentine public accountant and politician, a former member of Union por la Patria. Since 2023, he has been governor of the province of Tucumán. He had been vice governor between 2015 and 2023; he served between September 2021 and February 2023 as interim governor following the appointment of Governor Manzur as Chief of Staff of Ministers of the Nation.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJaldo is a native of the town of Trancas, province of Tucumán. He received his degree as a national public accountant from the Universidad del Norte Santo Tomás de Aquino.\n\n\n=== Political career ===\nIn 1987 he was elected mayor of Trancas. From 1989 to 1995 he was a provincial legislator.\nIn 1995 he returned to the mayor of Trancas and in 1999 he returned to the Legislature.\nIn 2000 he was appointed Minister of Economy during the mandate of Governor Julio Miranda.\nIn 2003 he was elected for a third term as mayor of Trancas. In 2004 he was appointed as controller of the province's Popular Savings Bank.\nIn 2007 he was elected as a provincial legislator. In 2009 he was elected national deputy. At the request of Governor José Alperovich, he resigned from office before taking office to continue heading the Ministry of the Interior.\nIn 2011 he was elected provincial legislator. The governor decided to keep him at the head of the Ministry of the Interior.\nIn 2013 he was elected national deputy. The following year he was summoned by Governor Alperovich to take charge of the Ministry of the Interior.\nIn 2015 he was elected vice-governor, accompanying Juan Manzur in the formula, a position for which he was re-elected in Tucumán provincial elections of 2019 .\nIn 2017 he was elected national deputy. He resigned before taking office.\nIn 2020, he was elected pro tempore head of PARLANOA by his peers from the provinces of the region.\n\n\n=== Interim Government ===\nIn September 2021, following the appointment of Governor Manzur as head of the Cabinet of Ministers, summoned by the President of the Nation Alberto Fernández, Jaldo was placed in charge of the provincial Executive Branch.\nIn 2023 he was elected governor of Tucumán accompanied by Miguel Acevedo as a candidate for vice-governor who ran for the banning of Juan Manzur, obtaining the 54.96% of the votes against Roberto Sánchez of Together for Change.\n\n\n== Management as Governor ==\nAfter he served as interim governor between 2021 and February 2023, he was elected governor in the Tucumán provincial elections of 2023, and since October 29, 2023, he has been the governor of Tucumán.\n\n\n=== Government Cabinet ===\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n\n=== Manzur-Jaldo Intern ===\nIn the PASO Elections of 2021 he generated controversy by breaking the unity of the Justicialista Party of Tucumán by presenting himself as a candidate for Deputy, generating an internal when facing the list of candidates of the governor Juan Manzur, in addition to a series of statements against the driver of the executive government of the province. Finally, Jaldo, upon losing the election with 39.64% of votes, declined his candidacy despite having won second place for the  General Elections, being replaced by Agustín Fernandez. In September 2021, Manzur was appointed Chief of Ministers, so Jaldo assumed the Interim governorship, calming the internal situation. In the Tucumán provincial elections of 2023 candidates for the governorship with the Jaldo-Manzur formula were in unity, but due to Manzur's disqualification from being a candidate, the formula finally ended up being formed by Jaldo and Miguel Acevedo.\nIn 2024, the Unity was broken when the legislative bloc of the Justicialista Tucumán Party separated into two currents, generating controversy with the deputies closest to Jaldo entering the Independence Block while the deputies closest to Manzur they remained in the block of Unión por la Patria.\n\n\n=== Creation of the Independence block ===\nIn January 2024, it generated internal controversies in Unión por la Patria after three national deputies for Tucumán decided to leave the coalition bloc to form their own Independencia bloc after voting in favor of the ruling. of the \"Bases Law\" of the government of Javier Milei. After this, the governor argued that \"the national government acceded to the requests of Tucumán and the different sectors of production\" and declared that they were not being pressured by anyone and acted in total freedom. Among the negative reactions is that of the head of the UxP bloc, Germán Martínez: \"He who betrays once, does it twice.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nOsvaldo Jaldo on Twitter\nOsvaldo Jaldo on Facebook\nOsvaldo Jaldo on Instagram",

The municipality is part of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao despite Cotabato being part of Soccsksargen.\n\n\n== History ==\nWhen the Bangsamoro was created in 2019 to supplant the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, 63 barangays in the province of Cotabato were grouped with the newer autonomous region in the second part of the plebiscite held in February 6. The mother municipalities and Cotabato province remained part of Soccsksargen.By March 2020, these barangays were designated as a Special Geographic Area (SGA) of the Bangsamoro region.On August 17, 2023, the bills consolidating the SGA barangays into 8 municipalities were approved by the Bangsamoro Parliament, The particular bill creating Pahamuddin was Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 129. The municipality's name was originally proposed to be named as Pahamudin, with a single \"d\".A plebiscite was held on April 13, 2024, and voters approved all eight bills reconstituting the SGA barangays to eight municipalities including Pahamuddin, where 5,974 voted in favor of its creation while 116 voted against. The Bangsamoro regional government will provide P2.5 million in funding for the municipal government until it gets its share of income from the National Tax Allotment. Pahamuddin was created from 12 barangays of Pigcawayan.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Barangays ===\nPahamuddin is politically subdivided into 12 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks  while some have sitios.\n\n\n== Government ==\nOfficers-in-charge will be selected by BARMM Chief Minister Murad Ebrahim to fill positions in the municipal government pending regular elections in 2025. The municipality will also stay under the jurisdiction of the Special Geographic Area pending the creation of a new province.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nConstruction began in 2023 for a bridge connecting Pahamuddin with Kabuntalan, Maguindanao del Norte in the contiguous Bangsamoro region.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Comatula solaris is a species of feather star in the family Comatulidae and the type species of the genus Comatula.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nComatula solaris was described by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in 1816. The generic name means 'having hair neatly curled', referring to the legs of the feather stars. The body contains high levels of magnesium calcite in the skeleton that makes up most of the body mass. The skeleton is composed of ossicles connecting to soft tissue and ligaments. The Comatula solaris are a species in one of two sister clades. They belong to the ten armed comatula, along with Comatula pectinata and other Comatula sp. The other clade has the twenty arm comatula, including Comatula rotalaria. Comatula solaris resemble flowering plants, with ten stiff arms and a ring of small cirri. Their arms contain hooks, developed on their pinnules, they give them the ability to cling to things. Comatula can also be divided into two categories based on how costals are arranged.\nComatula solaris are a species in which costals are united by syzygy, or two conjoined protozoa that can exchange genetic material. Their outer radials and first two brachials are also united by syzygy. Comatula solaris are stalked crinoids, and are attached to rocks or parts of the ocean floor, similar species are able to crawl, but there have been no reports of that in Comatula solaris. They are predicted to be facultatively mobile, meaning that they should be able to move if they needed to, but they don't have to.\nComatula solaris are suspension feeders, they allow water to filter through them and they feed on the small organisms that they capture. Comatula solaris are also blind, with little research being done on their nervous system it is unsure how they are aware of their surroundings. Comatula solaris can be easily compared to Comatula pectinata as they have almost identical COI sequences. \n\n\n== Distribution ==\nComatula solaris are found in marine environments only. They are found most commonly in the oceans of northern Australia, the Philippines, Singapore, and east India. The most prevalent research on Comatula solaris has taken place around Lizard Island  and the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. They are primarily found in exposed sandy sediment, and some have been found under rubble in sediment environments. Studies have found that they most commonly live in areas where the sea surface temperature is between 20 and 30 °C (68 and 86 °F) and the surface salinity is between 30 and 35 PSU. Comatula solaris are typically found in shallow water with depths between 10 and 20 m (33 and 66 ft), but have been found at depths of up to 500 m (1,600 ft).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Florence Mitchell (b. Redfern, Sydney, Australia 1891, d. Toorak, Australia 20 July 1970) was assistant state commissioner for Victoria Girl Guides, Australia from 1949 to 1953. In 1953 she received the Silver Fish Award, Girl Guiding's highest adult honour, for her contribution to Guiding, including her work with the Guide International Service (GIS) after WWII.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nFlorence Isobel Mitchell was born to John and Mary Mitchell. She had two brothers and one sister. She grew up in East Malvern, Melbourne.  Mitchell attended Presbyterian Ladies' College, Melbourne, in later life becoming the joint secretary, together with Esna Boyd, of the school's old girls’ society, Old Collegians.\nDuring her lifetime she lived in many towns in Victoria, including Kooyong, Malvern, Lalor and Toorak. Mitchell had a brother, Tom. In 1938 they were described by a gossip columnist as “that popular brother and sister” in Melbourne magazine Table Table. Both were keen amateur golf players.\nIn 1927 Mitchell was involved in an “exciting motor chase” when someone flagged her down to pursue a hit-and-run driver who had knocked over and killed a 53-year-old man.\n\n\n=== Travel ===\nIn 1926 Mitchell was one of seven teachers from the Victorian Education department who travelled to England on an exchange scheme. She worked at a school in London.\nMitchell spent 1934 dividing her time between Spain and England. While in England she stayed with Esna Boyd, her college friend and former Australian tennis champion. Mitchell found herself in Spain during the revolution of 1934, about which she said, “there was a fearful atmosphere in the city [Madrid], but we could speak no Spanish and we did not know there were any riots until we received urgent telegrams from England telling us to get out of Spain at all costs.”\nBetween 1938 and 1939 she and her brother Tom travelled together to Britain, America and Rhodesia for 6 months.\n\n\n=== Royal Agricultural Society ===\nMitchell's family was heavily involved in the Royal Agricultural Society of Victoria (RASV). Her father and brothers John and Tom all served on the council. Tom was president in the 1950s and Mitchell would frequently host Tom's guests during Royal Shows, and accompany him on visits. Her father owned an agricultural implement and machinery business, which was inherited by Tom.\n\n\n== Girl Guides ==\nMitchell was the district commissioner for Melbourne's East Malvern and Glen Iris Girl Guide district from 1930 to 1938. During a 1933 trip to England she visited Waddow Hall Guide centre and the Girl Guide Association's headquarters in London. After her district commissioner role, she was promoted to commissioner for South-eastern Division, Melbourne, a position she held until 1949. In 1949 she became Assistant State Commissioner for Victorian Girl Guides, a position she held until 1953. In 1953 she received the Silver Fish Award, Girl Guiding's highest adult honour. By this time she was also chair of the Victoria Girl Guides’ finance committee.\n\n\n=== Guide International Service ===\nDuring and immediately after WWII, Mitchell worked with the Guide International Service (GIS), a voluntary organisation responsible for equipping and sending Girl Guide leaders from Britain and other Commonwealth countries to perform relief work in post-war Europe. She was also involved in the collection and dispatch of clothing and goods for distribution from Victoria to war-affected regions. By 1947 she had become the president of the Victorian GIS committee.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is a tufted perennial herb with oblong to wedge-shaped leaves and sessile greenish-yellow flowers with 3 or 4 narrow bracts at the base.\n\n\n== Description ==\nXanthosia singuliflora is a tufted perennial herb that typically grows to a height of mostly 5–20 cm (2.0–7.9 in) and has many slender, diffuse stems less than 30 cm (12 in) long. Its leaves are oblong to wedge-shaped, mostly less than 12 mm (0.47 in) long sometimes trifoliate on the ends, on a long petiole. The flowers are sessile or on a very short peduncle, surrounded by 3 or 4 narrow bracts at the base of a very short pedicel, with 2 broader bracts close under the flower. The sepals are pointed and the petals are greenish-yellow. Flowering occurs from September to November and the fruit is prominently ribbed.\n\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\nXanthosia singuliflora was first formally described in 1864 by Ferdinand von Mueller in his Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae from specimens collected at Cape Pasley. The specific epithet (singuliflora) means \"single-flowered\".\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nXanthosia leiophylla grows on granite outcrops, undulating plains and winter-wet areas in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest and Warren bioregions of south-western Western Australia.\n\n\n== References ==",

White (1927 – December 10, 2023) was an American professor of electrical engineering, and cochlear implant pioneer.After becoming an expert in magnetics and a professor at Stanford, White switched to working on cochlear implants.  In 1964, he and surgeon Blair Simmons made a six-electrode device directly impanted into the auditory nerve in the modiolus, as opposed to the more modern approach through the scalae of the cochlea.  He continued to work with Simmons for decades on developing multi-channel implants of various sorts, and testing them with human subjects.\n\n\n== References ==",

Denied a place there in 1846, he benefitted from the absence of a selection jury in 1848, which was suspended due to the Revolution.He then presented three works at that Salon: Still-life, Night Effect and Souvenir of Italy. In \n1850–1851, he exhibited A Market and a  Portrait of M. P. D.... Shortly before his death, he exhibited a tableau called A Suburb of Lyon, During the Flood of 1856.He was equally, if not better known as a caricaturist; providing numerous illustrations for Le Gaulois, a weekly satirical journal. He designed their logo in 1858. His fellow staff members included Étienne Carjat, Paul Hadol and Alfred Grévin. One of his caricatures, of the sculptor Jean-Pierre Dantan, includes a caricature of himself, as a statuette.During that same time, he also worked for the photographer Pierre Petit who, together with Antoine Trinquart (1814–1871), had recently opened a studio called \"La Photographie des Deux Mondes\".\nOverwhelmed by serious financial and family problems, he decided to end his life. To do so, he bought some coal and asphyxiated himself, at home, with smoke from his stove. He could not be revived and died the next morning. Two days later, he was buried at Montmartre Cemetery.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nÉmile Bellier de la Chavignerie and Louis Auvray: Dictionnaire général des artistes de l'École française depuis l'origine des arts du dessin jusqu'à nos jours : architectes, peintres, sculpteurs, graveurs et lithographes, Renouard, 1882 pg.482 (Online @ Gallica)\nJohn Grand-Carteret, Les Mœurs et la caricature en France, Paris, Librairie illustrée, 1888, p. 640 (Online @ Internet Archive).\nLes Derniers bohêmes : Henri Murger et son temps, Paris, librairie Sartorius, 1874, pgs.36 and 261 (Online @ Gallica).\nFrançois Solo and Catherine Saint-Martin, Plus de 5000 dessinateurs de presse & 600 supports en France de Daumier à l'an 2000, Aedis, 2004, pg.257 ISBN 978-2-8425-9239-4\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\"Dumoulin, Gustave Paul Antoine\" @ the Database of Salon Artists (1827–1850)",

In 1963 she made a “remarkable recovery from a serious internal operation” at a Bath hospital.\nShe died in September 1973 in Wiltshire, and was buried alongside her husband in the family vault at St Laurence Church, Ansley. Amid great secrecy, her funeral was attended by Captain Mark Phillips and his then fiancée, Princess Anne. “Elaborate precautions” were taken to ensure that the funeral did not become a “royal funfair”.\n\n\n== Service ==\nPhillips was involved with many local and national organisations, including:\n\nAnsley Women’s Institute, president for 25 years\nAtherstone Grammar School, patron\nBaby Welfare of Hartshill and Chapel End, committee member\nChapel End and District Nursing Association, trustee\nNational Air Raid Precautions Animals Committee (NARPAC) for Nuneaton and District, district organiser\nNuneaton Hospital “Good Samaritan” fund, president\nNuneaton Women Conservatives, Hon. treasurer\nWomen’s Voluntary Services (WVS) for Oldbury district, representative\nYoung Women’s Christian Association, patron\nIn 1924 she led the Duke of York, the future George VI, on a tour of the newly opened Warwickshire Miners’ Convalescent Home at Higham Grange. In 1934 she and her husband donated a “finely carved old chair” to the Atherstone Rural District Council Chamber.\nHer war service included the Land Army, fire-watching and supporting Warwickshire’s war supply service. In 1942 she “hit upon a novel idea in order that she might raise money for the provision of emergency kits for men serving on destroyers” by selling flowers from her garden at the weekly market in Nuneaton. She donated £50 to both the Merchant Navy Comfort League and The Mission to Seamen.\nWhen her husband died in 1951, Phillips took his place on the Atherstone Rural Council as the representative of Oldbury Parish, a position she held for seven years.\n\n\n== References ==",

H. Griffiths, M.H. and P. C. Heemstra in 1995.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThe species has a distribution confined to the Angola–Benguela Frontal Zone (ABFZ) of the southeastern Atlantic Ocean. A study revealed that during a period of local warming, the species extended its distribution into Namibian waters, where it hybridized with the resident and congeneric Argyrosomus inodorus.\nAdults migrate in correlation with the movement of the Angola–Benguela frontal zone, traveling northward as far as Gabon in winter and returning to southern Angola in spring, coinciding with what appears to be offshore spawning.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nArgyrosomus coronus at the Global Biodiversity Information Facility",

        "content": "The São Pedro Atlético Clube is a Brazilian multi-sports club, founded on May 16, 2011, based in São Pedro da Aldeia, in the state of Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSão Pedro Atlético Clube, from the city of São Pedro da Aldeia (Região dos Lagos do Rio de Janeiro), was founded in the first half of 2011. The project debuted on June 29, Saint Peter's Day, with a friendly match at which some football stars who shone for a long time on the national scene, led by Valdir Bigode (who would become the first coach in the club's history) helped to brighten the celebrations of the city's patron saint. Held at the Waldemar Tadio Stadium, owned by São Pedro Esporte Clube, the event was attended by then-mayor Carlindo Filho, who promised that the city council would \"spare no effort to create a good squad\".\nHe debuted in professional football in Serie C of the 2012 Campeonato Carioca (currently Serie B1). In the first three matches, the team was led by Valdir Bigode, recording two wins and a draw. However, after a meeting with the board, the former player chose to leave the club after disagreeing with the ideology presented by the directors, who sought to clarify the roles of the administrative part and the coach, in order to avoid the accumulation of functions. Under Yan's command, São Pedro continued in Serie C and finished first in its group in both the first and second phases, but ended up being eliminated in the third phase after a goalless draw, in the last round, against Paduano.\nIn the following season, now led by Gilson Gênio, the São Pedro team narrowly missed out on gaining access: with the best campaign in the first phase, the Aldeense team advanced to the playoffs. In the first knockout match, they beat Mangaratibense 2–0, with two goals from Rafael Di María, and only needed a draw in the return game to be promoted. However, they ended up defeated 2–1 in Mangaratiba in normal time. As the Serie C regulations did not provide for goal difference as a tiebreaker, access was decided in a penalty shootout and the home team ended up winning 2–1. After the disappointment, coach Gilson Gênio was not approached by the board to renew and ended up leaving the club.\nIn the 2014 Serie C, the team finished in 8th place and, after the end of the competition, president Robson Maciel publicly considered the professional football license, citing a lack of resources and revealing that there was never a formal agreement with the city council. Despite the imminent crisis, São Pedro confirmed its ability to participate in the 2015 edition. Two weeks before the start of the tournament, however, the club had no squad, board, technical committee or even president: after the end of Maciel's term, no one took over afterwards. The first scheduled game, against Juventus, was suspended, but later, the club confirmed its withdrawal from the championship and was declared the loser of all matches by W.O..\nWithout competing in official competitions since then, São Pedro Atlético Clube was disaffiliated from the  Federação de Futebol do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FERJ) in November 2017, due to inactivity for a period of more than two years.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFootball in Rio de Janeiro\nCampeonato Carioca\n\n\n== References ==",

This may occur because the voter chooses not to fill out a complete preference ranking, or because the ballot format itself limits the number of preferences that may be expressed.\nFor example, under the Supplementary vote variant of Contingent vote, voters are limited to expressing their favorite and second favorite candidate. If neither candidate makes it to the runoff round, then that voters' ballot is exhausted and has no effect in the runoff round. Likewise, the form of contingent vote used in Sri Lanka limits voters to expressing 3 rankings, so if there are more than 3 candidates, their ballots can be exhausted. This can also happen under instant-runoff voting, such as in Minneapolis, which limits voters to 3 rankings.\n\n\n== References ==",

The chapter also shares its name with sixty-seventh chapter of the Quran, Al-Mulk.\n\n\n== History ==\nAccording to some Bahā'ī sources, Al-Mulk was revealed to Bab during his encounter with the young Shaykhī Mullā Ḥusayn Bushrū'ī in his house in Shiraz. This occurred on the evening of the 5th Jumada Al-Awwal 1260 in the Islamic calendar, or May 22nd 1844 in the Gregorian calendar. This chapter was titled Al-Mulk by the Báb himself as the word occurs several times within the chapter.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nVerses 1-5: Affirms the divine origin and truth of the revealed Book, emphasizing its role as a guiding light and straight path for humanity.\nVerses 6-13: Establishes the authenticity of the Book, presents the lineage of the Hidden Imam, and bears witness to the oneness of Allah while warning against disbelief and its consequences\nVerses 14-22: Emphasizes the oneness of Allah, His attributes of knowledge and authority, and urges believers to submit to His will and seek closeness to Him through worship and obedience.\nVerses 22-29: Addresses kings, urging them to relinquish worldly dominion in favor of divine truth, warning them of the consequences of opposing the Reminder, and emphasizing the inevitability of Allah's judgment.\nVerses 30-33: Assures believers of reward for obedience to the Reminder, reiterates the promise of high status in Paradise, and asserts Allah's authority over all things.\nVerses 34-39: Directs believers to convey divine signs to other regions, affirms Allah's sovereignty, and encourages obedience to His decrees while warning against disbelief.\nVerses 40-42: Promises reward for obedience to the Reminder and asserts Allah's power and knowledge over all creation.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The sea sweep (Scorpis aequipinnis), also known as the maomao, snapjack, sweep is a species of marine ray-finned fish from the subfamily Scorpidinae of the sea chub family Kyphosidae. It is native to the southwestern Pacific Ocean from Australia to New Zealand.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe sea sweep has deep and strongly compressed body with a thin caudal peduncle. The head is moderately sized with an almost straight dorsal profile, a short snout and quite large eyes. The mouth is small and oblique with small but strong teeth in the jaws arranged in broad bands with the outer band being enlarged and recurved. Most of the body is covered in very small ctenoid scales and there is a gently curved lateral line. The dorsal fin continuous with a very short first spine, there are a 10 spines which progressively become higher towards the tail, the first rays in the soft-rayed portion of the dorsal fin is only slightly higher than the spiny portion giving the dorsal fin an almost straight profile. The soft-rayed part of the dorsal fin contains 26-28 soft rays. The anal fin has 3 spines and 27-28 soft rays. The soft portion of the dorsal fin is notably longer than they spiny portion. It has small pectoral fin are small with the uppermost rays being the longest. The pelvic fins are also small and are located below and to the rear of the pectoral fins. Sea sweeps are grey ventrally, often with a tinge of blue, green, or sometimes brown. The belly is silvery. There are two indistinct dusky bands on the upper sides. This species can reach a length of 40cm and 3.5kg.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nIn Australia the species is known from the southern coast of New South Wales, around the south of the country and north to the central coast of Western Australia,  and in Port Phillip Bay, Victoria.\n\n\n== Habitat and biology ==\nSea sweeps are a schooling species that are seen in small aggregations to large schools often feeding on plankton. Adult sea sweeps are found on coastal reefs at depths down to at least 50 metres (160 ft), It feeds on plankton over rock reefs where it forms schools  while juveniles settle in tide pools and can be found in the brackish waters of estuaries. They spawn in the winter with the peak breeding season between May and August. The eggs are pelagic. The young fish grow very quickly for the first 2–3 years but growth slows down significantly after sexual maturity, although they may live over 50 years. Sea sweeps have separate sexes.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe sea sweep was first formally described by John Richardson in 1848.\n\n\n== Fisheries ==\nThe sea sweep is of secondary importance as a target for commercial fisheries and is caught using purse seines and trap nets. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Fort Henry was a stockade fort built in early 1756 in Berks County, Pennsylvania, to protect local settlers from Native American war parties, which were raiding the area frequently during the French and Indian War. It was one of the larger forts built in a defensive line, 12-20 miles apart, intended to safeguard the more densely-populated communities of the eastern Province of Pennsylvania. It was abandoned in 1759, and then briefly put back into use in 1763 during Pontiac's War.: 70–99 \n\n\n== History ==\nAt the beginning of the French and Indian War, Braddock's defeat at the Battle of Monongahela left Pennsylvania without a professional military force. Lenape chiefs Shingas and Captain Jacobs launched dozens of Shawnee and Delaware raids against British colonial settlements, killing and capturing hundreds of colonists and destroying settlements across western and central Pennsylvania.  In late 1755, Colonel John Armstrong wrote to Governor Robert Hunter Morris: \"I am of the opinion that no other means of defense than a chain of blockhouses along or near the south side of the Kittatinny Mountains from the Susquehanna to the temporary line, can secure the lives and property of the inhabitants of this country.\": 557 \n\n\n=== Tulpehocken massacre ===\nIn 1755, Native American warriors began systematically raiding and destroying Pennsylvania settlements. The Penn's Creek massacre took place on October 12 and the Great Cove massacre on November 1, along with numerous smaller assaults in which homes were burned and settlers killed or taken prisoner. The Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly, dominated by Quakers, was reluctant to take military action and refused to pass necessary funding bills to raise troops and construct forts, to the frustration of Governor Robert Morris. \nOn November 15, Native American warriors attacked a blockhouse built by farmer Dietrich Six and killed six settlers.: 179 : 80  The next morning, warriors attacked the Kobel family farm near Tulpehocken, killing Henry Kobel and his wife and three of his eight children, in what is known as the Kobel Massacre. On November 17 they attacked other farms in the area, killing 15 settlers, many of them children, and burning several homes. Conrad Weiser, who lived nearby, went to the town on November 18 to talk to Native American leaders. There he was confronted by an angry mob, furious to see him in the company of Native Americans. Community leaders demanded protection, petitioning the Assembly to \"grant a sufficient Sum of Money to maintain such a Number of regular Troops as may be thought necessary to defend our Frontiers, and build Fortifications in proper Places.\": 183  On November 26, Governor Morris succeeded in obtaining a grant of sixty thousand pounds from the Assembly, to build a string of defensive forts across central Pennsylvania, and to pay for the training, arming and provision of troops to defend the colony.: 228 \n\n\n=== Location ===\nIn February 1756, Governor Morris wrote to George Washington that \"on the east side of the Susquehanna the forts are about 10 or 12 miles asunder among which the most considerable [is] Fort Henry, at a pass through the mountains, called Tolihaio.\" The Tolehaio (or Tolihaio) Gap is sometimes referred to by another Native American name, the Swatara Gap, and refers to a water gap through Blue Mountains formed by Swatara Creek. Local settlers occasionally referred to the gap as \"the Hole.\" It was of strategic military significance as a route used by Native American warriors to reach eastern Pennsylvania.: 70  The fort was built on land belonging to the farmer Dietrich Six, who had already built a small blockhouse there, a few miles north of present-day Bethel Township, on the Shamokin Road leading to Fort Augusta.: 302, 319 \n\n\n=== Construction ===\nIn December, construction began on several forts intended to protect the civilian population: Fort Lebanon and its outpost Fort Northkill, Fort Swatara (a pre-existing fortified homestead), and its outpost Fort Manada, which was a blockhouse built by a local farmer. In January 1756, Pennsylvania infantry was sent to garrison these posts, and on January 25, Captain Christian Busse, with a company of 50 soldiers, was ordered by Governor Morris \"to proceed to the Gap at Tolihaio, and there to erect a stoccado [stockade] fort...and range the woods from that fort westward towards Swehataro [Swatara] and eastwards towards...Fort Lebanon.\" The forts were located close enough to each other that a patrol could travel within a day to the next fort. On February 1 1756, Governor Morris wrote to Governor Robert Dinwiddie explaining his plan to construct a chain of forts, noting that \"the most considerable of them is built at an important pass through the Kittahteny Hills, on our Northern Frontier, and I have called it Fort Henry.\" The origin of the name is unclear, but it may refer to Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, a younger brother of King George III.: 319 \nNo detailed description of the fort exists, and the only reference to its appearance comes from Major William Parsons, who visited the fort on May 29, 1756, reporting to Governor Morris:\n\n\"I went to Fort Henry, where were Capt. Christian Busse, his Lieut. Saml Weiser & Ensign Jacob Kern. This Fort is very well built, the Pallisades are Spiked together at the Top, the Houses within are all covered with Tyle and the whole is kept clean and in very good order. There is convenient Room within the Fort to parade and exercise all the Men.\": 321 \nThe reference to houses covered with tile is significant, as frontier forts rarely used building materials aside from wood and stone. The use of tile may have been intended to prevent the buildings from being easily set on fire.: 192 \n\n\n=== Garrison ===\nOn July 9 1756, Colonel Weiser wrote to Captain Busse ordering the distribution of troops to local farms, to protect men working in the fields at harvest time. Thirty-seven men were sent out to the farms, and nineteen were to remain at the fort, for a total of fifty-six.: 322  Because soldiers were frequently detached from the garrison to temporary duty elsewhere, Weiser decided to station a contingent of nine men and a sergeant to remain permanently at Fort Henry. A garrison roster from August-September 1756 lists a total of 53 men, including officers.  \nRegular calls for detachments to reinforce other forts frequently left Fort Henry with a reduced garrison. In October 1756, and February and April 1757, detachments of eighteen men and an officer were sent temporarily to Fort Augusta and other locations. The reduced garrison was not able to patrol as frequently between the forts or to mount much of a response to Native American attacks. In May 1757, men were again transferred from several forts to reinforce Fort Augusta, which the French were reportedly preparing to assault. After complaints from Colonel Weiser and Captain Busse, Deputy Governor William Denny considered relaxing the three-year term of enlistment and creating a three-month enlistment to allow local citizens to join as militia, under locally appointed officers, which would bolster the garrisons. On June 30, Governor Denny visited Fort Henry to announce this new plan:\n\n\"Intending to go to Fort Henry...I desired Col. Weiser to acquaint the Leaders of these infatuated People, that I shou'd be glad they would come and speak with me at the Fort. Accordingly, above Fifty substantial Freeholders, well mounted and armed, joined the Escort, & attended me to Fort Henry, where...they presented me a very respectful Address, assuring me of their Desire to have a proper Militia Law, and that they were determined under such a Law to serve and do their duty to their King and Country. Forty instantly were inlisted by Colonel Weiser out of this Neighbourhood, and a Magistrate about twenty Miles off wrote me he had inlisted forty more.\": 323–324 \nA total of 159 men enlisted for three months, but when the three-month term of service expired in September, the men returned to their farms, leaving the garrisons again undermanned. Colonel Weiser wrote angrily to Governor Denny:\n\n\"It is true, one hundred and fifty nine men were rased by your Honours order for three months, to replace those that were gone to Fort Augusta, but these mens time has been out for Some weeks and they are gone off having met with no further encouragement...How is it possible for to garrison Fort Henry with 30, The fort on Suartaro with 30 and Hunters Fort with 100 men and also to Send out strong ranging parties between Said forts?\": 325 \nThere was significant movement of troops in early 1758. On February 5, Lieutenant Jacob Kern reported a garrison of 89 men at Fort Henry, but on February 9, Commissary General James Young reported 105. On February 22, Colonel James Burd wrote: \"Had a Revew this morning at 9 AM found 90 soldiers under good Command & fine fellows...This is a very good stockaded Fort & every thing in good order & duty done pritty well.\": 326–27  When Major Thomas Loyd took command of the eastern line of defense in April 1758, the garrison was reduced to 45 men, and by July to 25. All but 17 of these were sent to join the Forbes Expedition in November.: 245 \n\n\n=== Military history ===\nThe fort was never attacked, but on July 11 1756, Colonel Weiser reported to Governor Morris that his son, Lieutenant Samuel Weiser, had told him that troops from Fort Henry had exchanged fire with a Native American war party at Caghuekacheeky. Twelve soldiers and six warriors were killed. According to the lieutenant, \"our people kept the field and scalped the Indians, and...the Indians ran off without any scalp.\": 697  The date and exact location of this battle were not reported.\nOn October 12 1757, a French officer appeared at the fort asking to surrender. He was questioned at Colonel Weiser's home and again at Reading.: 240  The soldier identified himself as Enseigne en second Michel Joseph Maray de La Chauvignerie, 15-year-old son of Michel Maray de La Chauvignerie, commander of Fort Machault. He had gone out 12 days earlier with a raiding party of seven Native American warriors and another Frenchman but after five days had become separated from them, and had lost his way. He wandered in the forest for a week before reaching Fort Henry. He was detained in Philadelphia and released in a prisoner exchange in 1759.: 293, 329–30 : 325 \nNative American war parties continued to attack local farms, killing two or three people at a time and taking children. In October 1758, the Pennsylvania Gazette printed an extract from a letter sent from Fort Henry:\n\n\"The First of October the Indians burnt a House on Swetara, killed one Man, and three are missing. Two Boys were found tied to a Tree, and Released. We are alarmed in the Fort almost every Night by a terrible Barking of Dogs; there are certainly some Indians about us; they hollow on the Mountain.\": 329 \n\n\n=== Abandonment ===\nCaptain Busse resigned in May 1759 and the fort was apparently abandoned after that. It served briefly as a patrol station in 1763-1764 during Pontiac's War,: 330  and was then permanently abandoned.: 245  Stone and wood from the fort were removed by farmers to be repurposed, but as late as 1882 remnants of the walls and the cellar of the gunpowder magazine were still visible.\n\n\n== Memorialization ==\nA stone monument was placed close to the fort's location in 1915 by the Historical Society of Berks County. its inscription reads: \"1756 FORT HENRY 25 yards north of this stone. French and Indian War.\" A historical marker was placed about a mile south of the fort's site by the Pennsylvania Historical Commission in 1959.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Searching for History ~ The French & Indian War in Pennsylvania,\" The Wandering Woodsman, May 19, 2023\nMap of Fortifications on the Pennsylvania frontier in 1756, showing Fort Henry on the right side of the first page.",

        "content": "Swainsona murrayana, commonly known as slender Darling-pea or slender Darling pea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae and is endemic to south-eastern mainland Australia. It is a prostrate, low-growing or erect perennial herb, with imparipinnate leaves with 3 to 11 linear to elliptic leaflets and racemes of 3 to 11 pink or purple flowers.\n\n\n== Description ==\nSwainsona murrayana is a prostrate, low-growing or erect perennial herb that typically grows up to 25 cm (9.8 in) tall and is densely hairy. The leaves are imparipinnate, mostly 5–10 mm (0.20–0.39 in) long with 3 to 11 linear to elliptic leaflets, the side leaflets mostly 5–30 mm (0.20–1.18 in) long and 1–2 mm (0.039–0.079 in) wide with a stipule 1–5 mm (0.039–0.197 in) long at the base of the petiole. The flowers are pink or purple, arranged in racemes of 3 to 11, on a peduncle 0.5–2 mm (0.020–0.079 in) wide, each flower about 10 mm (0.39 in) long on a pedicel 3–5 mm (0.12–0.20 in) long. The sepals are joined at the base to form a tube about 2.5 mm (0.098 in) long, with teeth shorter than the tube. The standard petal is about 10 mm (0.39 in) long and 7–8 mm (0.28–0.31 in) wide, the wings 8–10 mm (0.31–0.39 in) long and the keel 7–9 mm (0.28–0.35 in) long and 2–3 mm (0.079–0.118 in) broad. Flowering occurs from August to November, and the fruit is a narrowly elliptic pod 20–65 mm (0.79–2.56 in) long with the remains of the style about 4 mm (0.16 in) long.\n\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\nSwainsona murrayana was first formally described in 1881 by Heinrich Wawra von Fernsee in Oesterreichische Botanische Zeitschrift from specimens collected near the Murray River.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nSlender Darling-pea is usually found in seasonally wet areas and near lakes and is found on the western slopes and plains of New South Wales, in Northern and western Victoria and southern Queensland with an outlier in South Australia.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nSwainsona murrayana is listed as \"vulnerable\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the New South Wales Government Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016. The main threats to the species are grazing by domestic stock and by rabbits, weed invasion, agriculture and roadside maintenance.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Abū Marwān ʿAbd al-Malik ibn Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad ibn Ibrāhīm ibn Ṣāḥib al-Ṣalāt al-Bājī (fl. c. 1130–1198) was an Andalusī historian under the Almohads.Little is known of the life of Ibn Ṣāḥib al-Ṣalāt. His nisba indicates that his family came from Beja. He himself may have been born there or perhaps in Seville, where he spent his formative years and most of his life. He was studying theology in Marrakesh in 1165. His writings show that he was an eyewitness to many important events, including the Almohad conquest of Carmona in 1161, the fasts ordered in Marrakesh to celebrate the Caliph Abū Yaʿqūb Yūsuf's recovery from illness in 1170 and the battle of Huete in 1172. He was a ḥāfiẓ. He was still living in 1198.Ibn Ṣāḥib al-Ṣalāt's main work is al-Mann bi ʾl-imāma ʿala ʾmustaḍʿafīn bi-an jaʿalahum Allāh al-aʿimma wa-jaʿalahum al-wārithīn ('Gift of the Imamate to the Formerly Humiliated, Whom God Has Made Imams and Heirs'). Only the second volume of this work survives, covering the years 1159–1172 (AH 554–568). It is known from a single copy in the manuscript Marsh 433 in the Bodleian Library. It is especially important for its information on the inner workings of the Almohad administration. It has been edited and there is a Spanish translation. Ibn Ṣāḥib al-Ṣalāt is also sometimes cited as an authority by other authors, such as Ibn al-Qaṭṭān.Ibn Ṣāḥib al-Ṣalāt also wrote Thawrat al-murīdīn ('Revolution of the Disciples'), a history of the second period of taifas (factional kingdoms) that followed the collapse of the Almoravids. It is lost, but is partially known from citations by other authors, such as Ibn al-Khaṭīb.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==",
