        "content": "The Hexaemeron of Basil of Caesarea (d. 379) is a fourth-century Greek commentary on the Genesis creation narrative (or a Hexaemeron). It is the first known work in this genre by a Christian, although it was preceded by Jewish writings like the De opificio mundi of Philo of Alexandria in the 1st century AD (which Basil made use of in his Hexaemeron) and another, earlier lost work by Aristobulus of Alexandria in the 2nd century BC.\nBasil's Hexaemeron was composed over the course of nine homilies on the topic of the six days of creation, moving line by line through Genesis 1:1–26. His Hexaemeron originated as a lecture series that he delivered to the congregation of Caesarea Maritima over the course of three days in the year 378 AD. The audience was likely a group of \"average\" Christians, as opposed to fellow Christian intellectuals or a group that he would have considered to have been spiritually advanced.\n\n\n== Influences ==\nIn his homilies on the Hexaemeron, Basil covers a wide variety of subjects: the preexistence of matter and eternity of the world, the purpose of the world, the contemplation of beings, composition of the four elements, movement of the stars, behavior of the creatures of the land, waters, and air, etc. Many, if not all of these, were already motifs among classical authors such as Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics, and so forth. More recently, some have sought to focus on passing hints of influence by Plotinus as well, such as in Basil's use of the term sympatheia. As for the zoological information contained in Basil's works, while it has typically been thought that this came from his reading of the works of Aristotle, a recent re-evaluation has argued that Basil drew on a wider variety of sources and that his principal source was the Halieutica of Oppian. The genesis of Basil's knowledge of astronomy has also been studied and has been argued to have originated during his youth.\n\n\n== Content ==\nOn the topic of the eternity of the world, Basil takes on these subjects include that the world is not eternal but is in fact created. With respect to the position that the Creator eternally coexisted alongside the creation, Basil says that this is not possible due to their fundamentally different nature (not to mention that, for Basil, could matter be in no way equal to God). Theologically, Basil argues that the wording of Genesis — that God \"created\" as opposed to \"worked\" or formed\" — indicates an absolute beginning. Commenting on Genesis 1:2 and the question of whether the world was created ex nihilo as opposed to ex materia (from pre-existing matter), he defends creation ex nihilo. The description in the scripture of the world having been unformed, says Basil, is reasonable on the basis of the then-absence of elements such as vegetation. Basil rejects the doctrine, found among some philosophical schools such as Stoicism, of eternal return, that is, the periodic conflagration (destruction) and rebirth of the cosmos. All created beings have been planned ahead of time by God and are necessary within God's conceived plan, and the creation reflects back on and results in admiration on the Creator. The cosmos itself, then, acts as a sign of God's existence:May He Who has given us intelligence to recognize in the smallest objects of creation the great wisdom of the Contriver make us find in great bodies a still higher idea of their Creator. However, compared with their Author, the sun and moon are but a fly and an ant. The whole universe cannot give us a right idea of the greatness of God; and it is only by signs, weak and slight in themselves, often by the help of the smallest insects and of the least plants, that we raise ourselves to Him.Basil offered many architectural analogies for the cosmos, including an amphitheater where its participants are not merely spectators but \"fellow combatants\" (i.e. participants) and as a training ground for people to try and come to know God.\n\n\n== Method of interpretation ==\nBasil's Hexaemeron was composed over the course of nine homilies, and originated as a lecture series by Basil to the congregation of Caesarea Maritima over the course of three days in the year 378 AD. Basil was familiar with the allegorical mode of interpretation dominant at the Alexandrian school and the literal form of interpretation dominant at the Antiochene school. In his Hexaemeron, he sided with the literalist mode. For example, he wrote: \"For me grass is grass; plant, fish, wild beast, domestic animal, I take all in the literal sense.\" Basil was also in communication with Diodorus of Tarsus, a known polemicist against the Alexandrian school, with whom he may have exchanged ideas about the subject. Basil commented that allegorical interpretations result in excessive interpretations which become lavish with the meaning of the text, and as being often opposed to the plain or common sense reading of the text. However, Basil was not opposed in toto to the use of allegorical understandings of the text: instead, his primary issue was with excessive allegorization as opposed to the allegorical interpretations found in authors like Origen. One example he spoke of concerned the statement in Genesis 1:2 that the \"Darkness upon the deep\": Basil said that this passage had become the source of many myths such as the notion that the \"Darkness\" referred to represented an \"evil power\" or a \"personification of evil\". Basil also associated these forms of uncontrolled exegeses with heretical sects such as Manichaeans, Marcionites, and Valentinians.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nDue to its popularity, it was translated into numerous languages including Latin, Armenian, Syriac, Georgian, and Arabic. Later still, it was translated into Old Church Slavonic, indicating the continued interest in the work over long periods of time. A translation into Coptic must have also existed. Basil's brother, Gregory of Nyssa, produced his own text titled In Hexaemeron and well as praised his Hexaemeron as being as admirable as the holy texts of Moses. As the first in a line of many Christians works in the genre of Hexaemeral literature, his led to many others producing their own Hexaemeron as well as imitations of his text. For example, another of his contemporaries, Ambrose, produced an imitation. Jerome only mentions three of Basil's works: his Hexaemeron, his De Spiritu Sancto, and his Contra Eunomium. The Latin translation inspired Augustine to produce his own Hexaemeron, and was quoted by Isidore of Seville, the Venerable Bede, and Thomas Aquinas.\n\n\n== Translations ==\nClare Way, Agnes Clare.

        "content": "Zhao Zhongrong (1905 – 25 March 1951), courtesy name Yongkuan, was a lieutenant general in the Army of the Republic of China. He was a native of Guo County, Shanxi Province. He graduated from the Law Department of Chaoyang University in Beijing and Sun Yat-sen University in Moscow. He served as the county magistrate of Baotou County and the founder of the Three People's Principles. Executive director of the Central Committee of the Youth League, director of the Peking Office of the 12th War Zone of the Anti-Japanese War, standing member of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, and member of the first legislative session after the implementation of the constitution. During the second civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, he was sent to monitor Fu Zuoyi. Fu Zuoyi After the rebellion, Zhao Zhongrong was imprisoned and shot at the Yongdingmen execution ground in Beijing on 25 March 1951.\n\n\n== Life ==\nBorn in Nao County, Daizhou, Taiyuan Prefecture, Shanxi Province in the late Qing Dynasty, he joined the Kuomintang when he was in Taiyuan Middle School. He studied at the Law Department of Chaoyang University in Beijing in 1922. In 1925, he and Chiang Ching-kuo were sent by the Kuomintang to Sun Yat-sen University in Moscow for further studies. After returning to China, he served in the Kuomintang Beiping City Party Headquarters, in 1936 he was appreciated by Shanxi Provincial Chairman Xu Yongchang and appointed as the county magistrate of Baotou County. The Second Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, and Baotou was forced to evacuate after the fall of Baotou in October. In the same year, he served as a major general in the Eighth Theater. In 1938, the Three People's Principles Youth League was established. He served as the preparatory director, director and secretary-general of the Three People's Principles Youth League of Suiyuan Province in 1943. He was elected as the executive director of the Central Committee of the Three People's Principles Youth League in 1945. In 1945, he was appointed as the alternate Central Supervisory Committee member of the sixth session of the Kuomintang. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, he was promoted to lieutenant general and served as the director of Zhang Yuan's Office of Appeasement in Peking. In 1947, he was elected as the executive director of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang. Member, he was elected as the first legislator of the second district of Shanxi Province after the implementation of the constitution in 1948.\nIn 1947, when the civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party resumed, Fu Zuoyi, director of Zhang Yuan's Office of Appeasement, was renamed Commander-in-Chief of the Suppression of Bandits in North China. At the end of 1948, as the war situation of the Republic of China government took a turn for the worse, Pingjin was surrounded by the Chinese People's Liberation Army, leaving only 200,000 Fu Zuoyi's troops in Peiping in North China. On January 14, 1949, Fu Zuoyi contacted the CCP through third parties Su Jing, Deng Baoshan and others and reached a peace agreement. On January 16, he was ordered to go to North China with Zheng Jiemin, the Minister of Defense of the Republic of China, to urge Fu Zuoyi to go south quickly, and was ordered to monitor Fu Zuoyi. On January 31, 1949, Peiping fell and he was detained by Fu Zuoyi and unable to leave by plane. In June, he was detained by the CCP and his home was ransacked. Zhou Beifeng was responsible for the inspection of his home. In his later years, he recalled that Zhao Zhongrong was stubborn and refused to surrender. He was also unwilling to accept ideological reform at North China Revolutionary University. If he was willing to demote his status, he should be higher than Fu Zuoyi.\nOn 25 March 1951, he was shot at the Yongdingmen execution ground in Beijing.\n\n\n=== Commemorations ===\nAfter his death, his family was ruthlessly suppressed and persecuted. His wife was imprisoned by Ruiyun for 20 years. His daughter was sent to Inner Mongolia to do a labor camp. She could not bear the oppression and committed suicide. The other two daughters were persecuted and became mentally ill. After the reform and opening up, Zhao Zhongrong's daughter Zhao Anna moved overseas and began to work hard for her father to be enshrined in the Martyrs' Shrine in Taipei, the Republic of China.In February 2018, Feng Shih-kuan, Minister of Defense of the Republic of China, approved the posthumous recognition of Zhao Zhongrong as a martyr. On 27 March, Zhao Zhongrong was enshrined in the National Revolutionary Martyrs' Shrine, becoming the highest ranking general who died for his country in mainland China and was enshrined in the Martyrs' Shrine after the government moved to Taiwan.\nOn 10 May  2011, General Hsu Yen-pu, commander of the Army of the Republic of China, led important cadres and representatives of officers and soldiers to preside over the memorial ceremony for the late loyal and martyrs of the Republic of China, Generals Li Minyi and Zhao Zhongrong, at the National Revolutionary Martyrs' Shrine.  \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Uri Berliner (born 1956) is an American journalist who served as the senior business editor for NPR from 1999 until his resignation in April 2024.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBerliner was born in 1956 as the only child of lesbian rights activist Eva Kollisch and photographer and artist Gert Berliner, who married in 1948 and divorced in 1959. Gert's parents were captured by the Gestapo, sent to Auschwitz concentration camp, and executed in 1943. \nBerliner graduated from Sarah Lawrence College. He holds a graduate degree in journalism from Columbia University. He was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University in 1998.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBerliner began working for NPR in 1999. He oversaw business and economics coverage and supervised the program, \"Planet Money,\" which covered the global economy. \nHis reporting has been recognized with, among others, a Peabody Award, a Loeb Award, an Edward R. Murrow Award, and a Society of Professional Journalists \"New America\" Award.\n\n\n=== Essay criticizing NPR and resignation ===\nOn April 9, 2024, The Free Press published an essay by Berliner titled \"I’ve Been at NPR for 25 Years. Here’s How We Lost America’s Trust.\" in which he criticized NPR for having \"coalesced around the progressive worldview\" and \"an open-minded spirit no longer exists within NPR\". Berliner contended that NPR had lost America's trust by representing only a narrow segment of the U.S. population in its coverage.\nThe essay generated controversy, particularly within conservative media; former president Donald Trump argued on Truth Social that the federal government should rescind funding to NPR. Elon Musk wrote several critical tweets about NPR, Katherine Maher, and Wikipedia in the days after, in support of Berliner.[1]\nOn April 12, CEO Katherine Maher wrote an open memo to staff, alluding to Berliner's article without directly naming him, which asserted that some of its criticism was disrespectful and hurtful to staff. \nThe same day, Berliner was given a five-day suspension without pay. According to Berliner, the suspension was for failing to secure approval for outside work. Berliner resigned on April 17, saying he \"cannot work in a newsroom where I am disparaged\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Corrales railway station (Spanish: Estación de Corrales) was located in the Spanish municipality of Aljaraque, in the province of Huelva, autonomous community of Andalusia. The facilities were part of the Tharsis railway, a mining-industrial line that was operational between 1871 and 1999.\nThroughout its existence, the station served as a railway complex dedicated to the classification of mining trains coming from Tharsis and to serving the mineral installations in the area of Corrales, from which it took its name. Although ore transport was the main activity, for several decades the station also housed passenger services. The facilities remained in service until their closure at the end of 1999. Nowadays, the passenger building has been restored and fulfils other functions, although the rest of the facilities of the complex were dismantled.\n\n\n== Railway ==\nThe station was located at kilometre point 44.475 on the Tharsis-Río Odiel narrow-gauge railway line, at an altitude of 7 metres above sea level.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Tharsis railway was inaugurated on 6 February 1871, after several years of construction work. It was built by the Tharsis Sulphur and Copper Company Limited, a British company that owned several mines in the area and was looking for an outlet for the ore extracted by sea. In the Corrales area, an important railway station was built, dedicated to the formation and classification of mining trains. From this complex, the already formed convoys departed to the quay-wharf on the River Odiel. For some decades the station also provided passenger services.\nIn 1978 the management of the railway infrastructures passed into the hands of the Compañía Española de Minas de Tharsis, which maintained regular operation. In 1981, the state-owned company RENFE provided a link between its Gibraleón-Ayamonte line and the Corrales station by installing a third rail to the original mining railway track. This facilitated the circulation of Iberian gauge trains to the mining-industrial complex. In 1993 the quay-wharf on the Odiel was closed to service, so that from then on the ore began to leave the station by lorry. The rest of the railway line remained in service until its closure on 1 January 2000, although the last train had run on the route a week earlier, on 22 December. The railway was closed on 1 January 2000.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nCorrales was a marshalling yard, which had a large track yard for the reception and training of mining trains. The installations even had workshops for the maintenance of the \"Ruston\" model tractors and wagons. In an annexe there was an industrial plant for the treatment and storage of minerals. The railway station was located next to the main line, 400 metres north of the workers' casino, and 250 metres south of the thermal power station.\nOver the years, a population centre grew up around the railway complex, where the railway workers, miners and other workers of the Tharsis company lived. The main building of the station consisted of the stationmaster's room, staff office, offices, administration office and telephone switchboard located on the ground floor, as well as the stationmaster's living quarters —located on the first floor with its own vestibule—, dining room, five outbuildings, kitchen and project office. It had a rectangular floor plan with a surface area of 396 square metres and dimensions of 29 metres long by 7 metres wide. Its structure is made up of three attached volumes: a central one, which advances along the façade line, and two lateral ones. After the closure of the railway, between 2002 and 2003 the building underwent a complete restoration by the San José Obrero II Workshop School. It currently houses municipal offices.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDávila, José Miguel; Madrona, Antonio (2016). \"Las estaciones de ferrocarril de la línea de Tharsis: sistemas constructivos y estructurales\".

        "content": "Styphelia serratifolia is a species of flowering plant in the heath family Ericaceae and is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It is an erect, bushy shrub, with broadly egg-shaped leaves with the narrower end towards the base, and red, tube-shaped flowers arranged singly in leaf axils.\n\n\n== Description ==\nStyphelia serratifolia is an erect, bushy shrub that typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm (12–24 in), and has more or less glabrous branchlets. The leaves are broadly egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, or broadly lance-shaped, less than 12 mm (0.47 in) long and sharply-pointed. The flowers are arranged singly in leaf axils on a peduncle up to 2 mm (0.079 in) long, with bracteoles 2–3 mm (0.079–0.118 in) long at the base. The sepals are about 6.5 mm (0.26 in) long, the petals red and joined at the base to form a tube 8.6–11 mm (0.34–0.43 in) long with lobes 4.0–5.4 mm (0.16–0.21 in) long and bearded.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThis species was first formally described in 1839 by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle who gave it the name Stomarrhena serratifolia in his Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis, from specimens collected near the Swan River Colony by James Drummond. In 2020, Michael Hislop, Darren Crayn and Caroline Puente-Lelievre transferred the species to Styphelia as S. serratifolia in Australian Systematic Botany. The specific epithet (serratifolia) means \"serrated leaves\".\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nStyphelia serratifolia is widespread in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Esperance Plains, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest, Mallee, Swan Coastal Plain and Yalgoo bioregions of south-western Western Australia.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Daniel A. DiCenzo (born c. 1979) is an American college football coach. He is the head football coach for Wesleyan University, a position he has held since 2015.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nDiCenzo attended Williams and played college football and wrestling. He was a strong safety for the Ephs football team. He was named as a First Team All-New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC) in his senior year. He was also a four-year starter and two-year captain for the wresting team. He graduated from Williams in 2001 with a Bachelor of Arts in history with a concentration in economics and political science.\n\n\n== Coaching career ==\nIn 2001, DiCenzo was hired as the special teams coordinator and outside linebackers for Trinity (CT) under head coach Chuck Priore. In DiCenzo's final season in 2002, he was a part of the 7–1 NESCAC championship team.\nIn 2003, DiCenzo was hired as the assistant outside linebackers coach for Division I-AA Brown alongside Paul Frisone under head coach Phil Estes. In his lone season under Estes he helped guide the team to a 5–5 record.\nIn 2004, DiCenzo was hired as the defensive backs coach and recruiting coordinator for his alma mater, Williams, under first-year head coach Mike Whalen. In six seasons as an assistant coach for Williams he helped lead the team to a 38–10 record and an undefeated 8–0 season in 2006. He helped coach defensive back Jon Poppe who went on to become the head football coach for Union (NY) and Columbia to First Team All-NESCAC honors.\nDuring DiCenzo's stint with Williams he was an assistant wrestling coach from 2004 to 2006. In 2004 and 2006, he was named New England Collegiate Conference Wrestling Association (NECCWA) Assistant Coach of the Year. In 2007, he was promoted to head wrestling coach and maintained the position until he was hired by Wesleyan in 2010. In three seasons he amassed an overall record of 50–16–1.\nIn 2010, DiCenzo followed Whalen when he was hired as the head football coach for Wesleyan. DiCenzo was hired as Whalen's associate head coach and defensive coordinator. In five seasons as an assistant coach he helped lead the team to a 26–14 record including a 7–1 record in 2013 alongside a NESCAC championship.\nAfter Whalen resigned following the 2014 season to focus his efforts fully on his athletic director duties, DiCenzo was named head football coach. In his first season as head coach he led the team to a 5–3 record which finished tied-fourth in the NESCAC. His best win of his first season was against his alma mater where the team won 27–7 and were winning 27–0 until the final 71 second of the game. In the following season his team improved to a 6–2 record which finished tied for third in the division. Two of his six victories came against Williams and Amherst of the Little Three. His only losses on the season came to Tufts in the first week of the season and Trinity (CT) which came in the last week of the season. Wesleyan went on to finish 6–3 and 5–4 in 2017 and 2018 respectively before having the best record of DiCenzo's tenure as they finished 8–1 in 2019. Their only loss on the season came to eventual-conference champions Middlebury. 2019 also marked the first time his team was able to beat Trinity (CT). On July 7, 2020, Wesleyan announced they would cancel fall sports, including football, for the 2020 fall season due to COVID-19. The team returned for the 2021 season. From 2021 to 2023, DiCenzo led the Cardinals to three-consecutive 6–3 season which all finished third or tied for third and has amassed an overall record of 48–22. His 48 wins are good enough for fourth all-time in Wesleyan football history behind Norm Daniels (76), Frank Hauser (68), and Bill MacDermott (66).\n\n\n== Head coaching record ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWesleyan profile",

        "content": "The St. Sotir Church or Transfiguration Church is an Eastern Orthodox church serving the Aromanian community in the city of Korçë (Aromanian: Curceaua, Curceauã, Curceau or Curciau), Albania. The church was built between 1995 and 2005 with support from Romania. Its first priest was Dhimitraq Veriga, who was ordained priest in Romania and performed religious services in both Albanian and Aromanian. Romanian is also used during the church's services. The church has become an important center of cultural activities for the Albanian Aromanian minority, and it has maintained close contact with institutions and representatives from Romania.\nThere had already been a church, in a different location in Korçë and also with St. Sotir as its patron saint, for the Aromanian community of the town. It was completed in 1925 following decades of fundraising and construction. Its construction started at the initiative of the Aromanian priest Haralambie Balamaci, who was murdered before its completion in 1914 by Greek antartes fighters and pro-Greek Aromanians. He is today remembered in the modern St. Sotir Church through a bust and annual memorial services. The original St. Sotir Church was damaged by an earthquake in 1931. Its building was demolished in 1959 by order of a local official of Albania's communist regime.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Original church ===\n\nIn 1905, Aromanian priest Haralambie Balamaci (also known by the name of Papa Lambru) established a chapel in his house in Korçë (Aromanian: Curceaua, Curceauã, Curceau or Curciau), then in the Ottoman Empire and now in Albania. Balamaci had the long-term plan of building a church for the Aromanians of the town, and he went afterwards to Bucharest in Romania to collect money for this aim. He had already collected some funds (more precisely, 1,497 Romanian lei) from 1886 to 1903 for planned buildings for the Aromanians through the society Diștiptarea (\"The Awakening\"), which he had founded on 18 December 1886. Balamaci stayed in Bucharest for around a year, during which he bought a 763 square metres (8,210 square feet) plot of land in Korçë from a native of the town living in Bucharest to build the church. He collected 4,607 lei from Aromanians as well as Albanians (including future Prime Minister of Albania Pandeli Evangjeli) in Bucharest. These funds and those obtained through Diștiptarea were either saved for the future church or used for the chapel and a school for the Aromanians of Korçë. The latter also functioned at Balamaci's house, and he aimed to erect a building for it as well.\nOn 15 November 1909, a seven-member committee, of which Balamaci was the president, was established by the community of pro-Romanian Aromanians of Korçë to open subscription lists to help fund an Aromanian church for the town. The church's construction was budgeted at some 60,000 lei, and by early 1912, 22,183 additional lei had been raised from Korçë, Bucharest and various cities in the United States. The Romanian–Aromanian newspaper Peninsula Balcanică (\"The Balkan Peninsula\") helped fund the project through the release of a promotional brochure. Sold for one leu, the funds obtained with the brochure were donated for the construction of the church. According to Romanian Aromanian professor Alexandru Gica, Balamaci's brother Epaminonda was probably the brochure's author. He was the attorney-in-fact of Korçë's pro-Romanian Aromanian community for launching subscription lists and collecting money donated for the church's construction.\nIn December 1912, during the First Balkan War, Greece occupied Korçë, and the construction of the church was stopped. Subsequently, on 23 March 1914, Balamaci and his brother Sotir, as well as other members of the Aromanian community of Korçë, were murdered in an attack against the community by a band of Greek antartes fighters and pro-Greek Aromanians. The perpetrators put in the brothers' pockets photos of the Greek bishop Photios of Korytsa, suggesting that the act was a reprisal for the bishop's murder in September 1906. Furthermore, according to eyewitnesses, as Balamaci was being taken away to be killed, some in the band shouted loudly that Balamaci was a \"propagator and apostle of Romanianism\". Balamaci's killers also robbed his house, stealing funds destined for institutions for the Aromanians of Korçë. Some 35,000 lei had been collected for the church at the time of his murder. As a result of the robbery, the completion of the church was delayed. Balamaci was buried in the vacant site where the church was being built.\nThe construction of the church was finally completed in 1925. It was located at the intersection of the Republika Boulevard with Pandeli Cale Street in modern Korçë, near today's Majestik Cinema movie theatre. The church was consecrated on 25 October 1925, and had St. Sotir as its patron saint. On the same day, a bust of Balamaci located within the precinct of the church was unveiled. The event was attended by the Romanian minister plenipotentiary to Tirana, Simion Mândrescu. The church was severely damaged by an earthquake in 1931. Posteriorly, a small chapel was built next to the damaged church in which priest Cotta Balamace served. It is he who succeeded Haralambie in providing religious services to the Aromanians of Korçë, having been quickly ordained a priest in 1914 to take Haralambie's place.\nIn 1959, during Albania's communist regime, the chief of the committee for Korçë of the ruling Party of Labour of Albania ordered the demolition of the church's crumbling building. A three-story residential block was built in its place. The chief's father was among those who murdered Balamaci. He exhumed Balamaci's bones and broke them as reported by Gica, quoting the account of a relative of Haralambie, Nick Balamaci. Nick did not want to mention the name of this chief, which was interpreted and praised by Gica as an attempt to leave behind the grudges of the past. Marioara Balamace, Haralambie's granddaughter, took her grandfather's remains and reburied in 1962. In 1970, the Albanian communist authorities decided to bury Balamaci in the Martyrs' Cemetery in Korçë.\n\n\n=== New church ===\n\nOn 5 April 1992, Aromanians of Albania (Arumunët e Shqipërisë), an Aromanian cultural organization in Albania, held its first conference. The organization had been officially registered on 24 October 1991, as communism was beginning to fall in Albania. During the conference, it was decided that a priest had to be trained to hold services in Aromanian for the Albanian Aromanian minority. The person chosen for this purpose was Dhimitraq Veriga, a founding member of the association. Veriga stayed in Romania from 1992 to 1993, where he studied at the Neagoe Vodă Basarab Orthodox Theological Seminary in Curtea de Argeș, as Balamaci did during his lifetime. He was ordained priest on 6 December 1992 by the Romanian Archbishop of Argeș and Muscel Calinic Argatu, who had been present at the 1992 conference. Veriga returned to Albania in April 1993 with the objective of reopening the St. Sotir Church, and on 24 September, he consecrated the chapel of the future new church in a hall of the former school \"Ballamaçi\", which was once a school for the Aromanians of Korçë. On 8 October 1995, the new St. Sotir Church began to be built in its current location. It was completed in 2005. Its construction took place with support from the Romanian state.\nThe new church is located on the outskirts of Korçë, at the entrance of the Rinia Park. It includes the place of the former Aromanian cementery of the city. It is a triconch (with three apses) church with a cross-shaped roof and a dome. The esonarthex (the inner of two narthexes in a church) and the porch are located in the western side. The church features an iconostasis carved in wood and mural paintings. A bust of Balamaci is also located in the church. Installed by the Nicolae Iorga Foundation of Sarandë, it was unveiled on 10 May 2021, on the Balkan Romanianness Day, a public holiday in Romania. The foundation has also expressed its intention of restoring the building of the original chapel, adding to it a museum of Aromanian culture and a space for children to learn Aromanian.\nDhimitraq (also Dhimitër, Dumitru, Dumitrache, Tache or Tachi) Veriga was born on 14 June 1943 in Korçë to Aromanian parents. Before becoming a priest, he was a sculptor, having erected several works in Korçë, including a sculpture of Balamaci. In addition to the services performed at the St. Sotir Church, Veriga also took part in numerous religious ceremonies in many other churches in the area of Korçë. He gave these services in both Aromanian and Albanian, contributing to the preservation of Aromanian in the country. Romanian is also used for the services at the St. Sotir Church. Veriga went frequently to Romania to deal with any issues related to the church and maintained good relations with the Department for Romanians Everywhere and the Romanian Orthodox Church. On 1 December 2011, he was awarded the Order of Cultural Merit in the rank of \"Commander\" by the President of Romania Traian Băsescu for being one of the most prominent defenders and promoters of Aromanian culture in Albania. Veriga died on 5 September 2016. For his activities during his lifetime, Albanian Aromanian activist Valentin Mustaka referred to Veriga as \"the most worthy resemblant of our martyr Papa Lambru Balamaci\". As of 2019, the St. Sotir Church had Andrea Zhurka, an ethnic Albanian, as its priest.\nThe new church has hosted several activities and events. Bogdan Stanoevici, then Minister Delegate for Relations with Romanians Everywhere, attended religious service at the church on 21 September 2014 during a visit to Korçë in which he also met with several leaders of local Aromanian associations and representatives of the local authorities. On 7 November 2021, an event was organized at the church for the release of Abecedar aromân (\"Aromanian Alphabet\"), a manual for learning Aromanian by Thoma Binjaku. The manual's release was supported by the Department for Romanians Everywhere, and the Romanian ambassador to Albania attended the event. On 8 May 2022, Zhurka and priest Dorel Tomoiagă of Baia Mare in Romania held religious service at the church in Albanian and Romanian on the occasion of the Eastern Orthodox holiday of the Sunday of the Myrrhbearers as well as the Europe Day celebrated the next day. The church's choir sang and prayed in Albanian, Aromanian and Romanian. The church, together with other churches in Romania and of the Romanian diaspora, has held annual memorial services on 23 March to commemorate Balamaci and the other Aromanians murdered that day in Korçë in 1914, as well as any other Romanian, Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian \"martyrs\" that acted in defense of their identity.\nThe church has been subject to numerous robberies and attacks. It was damaged considerably on 17 December 2017, shortly before Christmas, and also suffered an attempted robbery. On 10 April 2018, the church's exterior was damaged and some 20,000 Albanian lekë were stolen. On 20 July 2022, the church's safe was forced by people who possibly entered during a wedding that day and hid inside the church's premises until the priest left. Later that same year on 15 November, the donation box of the church was robbed. The culprits of these crimes were not identified despite the police's efforts. The Metropolis of Korçë of the Albanian Orthodox Church called for the police to find the perpetrators and bring them to justice.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===",

The band, managed by Patrick Meehan, featured the very Janis Joplin-esque vocals of lead singer Lynn Carey. It also included Alan Hurtz, James Newton Howard, Coffi Hall, and Neil Merryweather.  Mama Lion released two albums before disbanding in 1974.  Their debut album, Preserve Wildlife (1972), is well known for its provocative album cover, depicting lead singer Lynn Carey breastfeeding a lion cub.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nPreserve Wildlife (1972)\nGive It Everything I've Got (1973)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMama Lion at Allmusic\nMama Lion at Last.fm",

        "content": "Shoshong is a constituency in the Central District represented in the National Assembly of Botswana by Aubrey Lesaso, a BDP MP and Assistant Minister for Tertiary Education, originally elected as a UDC MP in 2019.\n\n\n== Constituency profile ==\nSituated in the southeast of the Central District of Botswana, the Shoshong constituency was established in 1965 for the country's inaugural elections and is one of Botswana's longest extant constituencies.\nReflecting the dominant Ngwato population, the constituency was historically a Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) stronghold. From 1965 to 2014, the BDP consistently garnered an average of 80% of the vote. However, since the turn of the century, the BDP's dominance began to wane, with its vote share decreasing in each subsequent election.\nIn 2019, echoing a broader trend within the district, a significant political realignment occurred as Ian Khama, paramount chief of the Ngwato tribe fell out with the incumbent president, Mokgweetsi Masisi and leader of the BDP. This political discord impacted the constituency's voting patterns. The 2019 election saw a significant 22-point swing towards the opposition Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) from the BDP, marking their strongest national performance and the first time an opposition party won Shoshong. \nThe constituency, predominantly rural, encompasses the following villages:\n\nShoshong\nMmutlane\nKalamare\nBonwapitse\nMosolotshane\nIkongwe\nKodibeleng\nOtse\nMokgenene\nPoloka\nMoralane\nDibete\n\n\n== Members of Parliament ==\nKey:\n  BDP   UDC\n\n\n== Election results ==\n\n\n=== 2019 election ===\n\n\n=== 2014 election ===\n\n\n=== 2009 election ===\n\n\n=== 2004 election ===\n\n\n=== 1999 election ===\n\n\n=== 1994 election ===\n\n\n=== 1989 election ===\n\n\n=== 1984 election ===\n\n\n=== 1979 election ===\n\n\n=== 1974 election ===\n\n\n=== 1969 election ===\n\n\n=== 1965 election ===\n\n\n== References ==",

He is also the father of Chantal Baudis.\nElected deputy for Haute-Garonne in 1958 and re-elected in 1962, he sat in the Democratic Center group (Independents and MRP). He supported the candidacy of Jean Lecanuet during the presidential election of 1965.\nIn March 1967, he was beaten in the legislative elections by André Rousselet, a close collaborator of François Mitterrand. He will find his seat in June 1968 and will be related to the group of independent Republicans (the “Giscardiens”). Deputy mayor of Toulouse Louis Bazerque since 1959, he is responsible for the city's important social sector. In March 1971, he ran against the same Louis Bazerque and was elected in the second round with 58% of the votes. He was general councilor since 1961 and remained so until his death.

        "content": "On March 25, 2024, New York Police Department (NYPD) officer Jonathan Diller was shot while conducting a traffic stop in Far Rockaway, Queens. He was subsequently transported to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, where he died due to his injuries.\nThe alleged killer, Guy Rivera, was shot on the scene by Diller's partner and hospitalized. He was later charged with murder, attempted murder, and criminal possession of a weapon. Rivera had 21 prior arrests, according to New York City mayor Eric Adams. The driver of the vehicle involved in the incident, Lindy Jones, was charged with weapons offenses. At the time of the incident, Jones had 14 prior arrests and was out on bail for a prior weapons offense.\nThis was the first killing of an NYPD officer in the line of duty since January 2022, when two officers responding to a domestic disturbance call were shot in a Harlem apartment building. Diller's killing generated widespread attention in New York City. His wake and funeral were attended by thousands of people, including various public figures. The lengthy criminal records of the suspects led to debate about the city's policies on crime and punishment. \n\n\n== Shooting ==\nAround 5:50 p.m. on March 25, 2024, New York Police Department (NYPD) officer Jonathan Diller and other NYPD officers approached a Kia Soul that was illegally parked at a bus stop on Mott Avenue in Far Rockaway, Queens. Another police officer had reported seeing a man carrying a firearm in the front pocket of his sweatshirt enter the passenger side of the vehicle prior to this encounter, according to Queens district attorney Melinda Katz.\nThe occupants refused to comply with police orders to exit the vehicle, according to the NYPD's chief of detectives, Joseph Kenny. Officers then attempted to remove the passenger, 34-year-old Guy Rivera, from the vehicle. At this point, Rivera allegedly shot Diller at point-blank range in the torso, below his bulletproof vest. Rivera then allegedly attempted to shoot another police officer, sergeant Sasha Rosen, but the gun malfunctioned. Officer Veckash Khedna, Diller's partner who was positioned on the driver's side of the vehicle, subsequently returned fire, striking Rivera in the back. Chief Kenny said Diller \"stayed in the fight\" and disarmed the shooter despite being wounded.\nWithin seconds of the first shot being fired, the driver of the Kia Soul, 41-year-old Lindy Jones, was removed from the vehicle and taken into custody. Diller was then helped into an unmarked car and rushed to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center. He underwent emergency surgery but died due to his injuries. He was 31 years old. Rivera was transported to the same hospital and received treatment for his injuries.\n\n\n== Victim ==\nJonathan E. Diller was the youngest of three children. He grew up in Franklin Square, New York, and during his childhood he skiied, and played hockey and lacrosse. Diller attended H. Frank Carey Junior-Senior High School until 2006, when he transferred to St. Mary's High School in Manhasset. Diller led his high school team to a 2010 state championship in lacrosse. He then attended State University of New York Maritime College and graduated with a degree in marine transportation in 2014. His first gained employment in the shipping industry, and his job would often take him away from New York for weeks at a time. Diller married his wife Stephanie (née McCauley) in 2019 and they had a son in 2023.\nDiller joined the NYPD in February 2021. After graduating from police academy, he arrived at the 105th precinct. His first commanding officer, inspector Igor Pinkhasov, said Diller adapted quickly and excelled on patrol in one of the precinct's busiest areas. He also played catcher for the precinct softball team. In 2023, Diller was selected to join the NYPD's Queens South community response team, one of the department's elite units. Pinkhasov recalled that Diller \"was above and beyond everyone else, so that’s why I signed his paperwork and let him go to CRT.\" Diller made 70 arrests during his three years on the force, and was decorated three times for \"excellent police duty\". He was posthumously promoted to Detective First Grade by NYPD commissioner Edward Caban and given the shield number 110, in reference to his son's birthday. \n\n\n== Suspects ==\nThe suspect who allegedly shot Diller was named as Guy Rivera. New York City mayor Eric Adams stated Rivera had a lengthy criminal record with 21 prior arrests, including 9 felonies. He was arrested in 2011 for assault and robbery, and was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison after pleading guilty. He was arrested again in 2015, for possession of a controlled substance, and received a sentence of six years. He was additionally convicted of a hate crime for throwing feces and urine at correctional officers while imprisoned. He was released in 2021 after serving nearly five years. Rivera's mother, Keshia Gilyard, said Rivera was distrustful of law enforcement after his multiple prison terms.\nLindy Jones, who police stated was the driver of the Kia Soul, had 14 prior arrests, dating back to 2001 when he was charged with attempted murder and robbery. He was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment in 2003 in relation to that case, and was released in 2013. At the time of Diller's killing, Jones was out on $75,000 bail after being charged with second-degree criminal possession of a weapon for allegedly having a loaded firearm in Far Rockaway in April 2023.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nOn March 27, 2024, Jones was charged with two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon and two counts of third-degree criminal possession of a weapon. Prosecutors said a loaded 9mm pistol–a separate weapon from the one used in the shooting–was found inside the Kia, and that the pistol was \"defaced, with the serial number scratched off.\" Jones potentially faces 15 years in prison for these weapons charges, as well as 15 years for the separate weapons charges from 2023. Jones told police that he did not know Rivera, stating that he had picked up the alleged shooter as a hitchhiker.\nAfter undergoing surgery for his wounds, Rivera was charged on March 28 with first-degree murder of a police officer, first-degree attempted murder, and criminal possession of a weapon. He faces life imprisonment without the possibility of parole if found guilty. Rivera is being represented by lawyers from the Legal Aid Society. According to prosecutors, an X-ray performed during Rivera's hospitalization discovered a shiv hidden in his rectum. Rivera suffered potentially permanent nerve damage as a result of being shot.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nDiller's killing led to an outpouring of grief from his fellow NYPD officers. NYPD commissioner Edward Caban stated on March 25: \"Tonight this city lost a hero, a wife lost her husband, and a young child lost their father. We struggle to find the words to express the tragedy of losing one of our own.\" Diller was the first NYPD officer to be killed in the line of duty since January 2022, when Jason Rivera and Wilbert Mora were fatally shot by Lashawn McNeil while responding to a domestic disturbance call in a Harlem apartment building. For Diller's funeral on March 30, thousands of police officers lined the streets as the hearse transported his coffin to St. Rose of Lima Church in Massapequa. In her eulogy, Diller's widow Stephanie referenced the murders of Rivera and Mora. She said: “At the funeral for Detective Rivera two and a half years ago, his wife Dominique pleaded for change. That change never came and now my son will never know his father and I will grow old without my husband.\" She received support from other NYPD widows for her statement.\nNew York City mayor Eric Adams addressed the killing in a press conference the day afterwards and mentioned recidivism and severe mental illness as problems in the city, also referencing another incident on March 25 in which a suspect with a long criminal history had allegedly killed a man by pushing him into the path of an oncoming train in an East Harlem subway station. Adams said: \"It's the same people over and over again. These are bad people who are doing bad things to good people. It's the good guys against the bad guys and we have to recognize that.\" Patrick Hendry, president of the Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York, described the suspect who allegedly shot Diller as a \"vicious career criminal\" who \"should have never been on the streets.\" Mayor Adams discussed his plans to aggressively tackle crime, but rejected notions that the city was \"out of control\" and stated crime rates in the city have decreased. He also spoke of his administration's efforts to expand Kendra's Law and \"institute a process of removing those who are a danger to themselves and others\".\nThe killing generated political debate. Some commentators, particularly Republicans, cited the killing as an example of lax public safety policies advanced by New York Democrats. Vincent Vallelong, president of the NYPD's Sergeants Benevolent Association, said in a letter to union members: \"I’m sure that many elected officials will attend PO Diller’s funeral, shed a few crocodile tears, and prominently seat themselves for a good photo opportunity. The sad reality is we don’t want them there.\" The governor of New York, Kathy Hochul, attended Diller's wake and was confronted by a family member of Diller as she left. Hochul recalled that she \"said prayers at the casket\" and denied reports that she had been asked to leave, stating: \"We were told the family is welcoming. We always check, and they said to come, and I went.\" Hochul has faced criticism for the state's bail reform dating back to when she was lieutenant-governor, and what Republicans perceive as soft-on-crime policies. Hochul has stated she has tried to reverse the bail laws: \"everyone knows my positions on the bail laws. I’m the one who’s been trying to make the changes to go back to where it was.\"\nPresident Joe Biden offered his administration's condolences to Diller's family, and contacted Mayor Adams regarding the situation. This was the first time Biden and Adams had spoken in over a year, amidst a conflict between the pair related to the New York City migrant housing crisis. White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre described Diller's death as a \"painful reminder of the toll of gun violence\", and said Biden's administration has worked to address this issue. Former President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 Republican Party nominee who was born in Queens, attended Diller's wake at the invitation of Diller's family. He had previously spoken to the officer's family via telephone on the day after the shooting. In remarks made to reporters after the wake, Trump mourned the death of Diller and called the alleged shooter a \"thug\".\nMore than $2 million was pledged to Diller's family through fundraising efforts. Over $700,000 was donated through a GoFundMe campaign started by a member of the NYPD SCUBA team as of March 30. A further $750,000 was raised through a fundraising campaign by Barstool Sports, and the company's founder Dave Portnoy promised a matching donation. The Tunnels to Towers Foundation announced on March 28 that it would pay off the mortgage on Diller's home in Massapequa Park. The New York Islanders, a hockey team which Diller supported, observed a moment of silence for Diller ahead of their game against the Chicago Blackhawks on April 2, and announced that proceeds from the 50/50 raffle at the following game would be donated to Diller's family. It generated $152,659, the largest 50/50 raffle in the team's history.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty in the United States\n\n\n== References ==",

It was demolished in 1836 and rebuilt at a cost of £500, to a design by John Freeman.  It was consecrated in January 1837, the first new church in the recently created Diocese of Ripon.  The church is in the Early English style and is built of white brick.  It has a square stone tower which projects at the west end and has battlements.  The church originally seated 210 worshippers.  The Victorian church clock was restored in 2023.Nikolaus Pevsner describes the church as \"uncommonly unattractive\".  It is not a listed building.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Moderantism was, together with Progressivism, one of the two main currents of 19th century Spanish liberalism. It had its origins in the so-called moderates during the Liberal Triennium, who during the reign of Isabella II formed a party, the Moderate Party, which was the party that remained in power the longest and managed to integrate the \"reformist\" absolutists into its ranks. The less conservative sector of the Moderate Party formed the Liberal Union in 1854. During the Restoration, the members of the Moderate Party joined Antonio Cánovas del Castillo's Liberal-Conservative Party.\nTheir European points of reference were French doctrinairianism and British conservatism. Their adversary in Spanish public life was progressive liberalism, although both constituted the only part of the political spectrum institutionally accepted for the political game, the so-called dynastic parties.\n\n\n== Origin ==\nModerantism, although its origins can be traced back to the Spanish War of Independence, in the position of the Jovellanistas (through Jovellanos), intermediate between absolutists and liberals in the debates at the Cortes de Cádiz, did not become explicit as a political movement until the Liberal Triennium (in which the moderates opposed the exalted). Even then it did not take shape in its definitive form. This took place in the last years of the reign of Ferdinand VII, when the Elizabethan group within the court, around the future regent María Cristina de Borbón, tried to attract the most moderate among the liberals (Francisco Martínez de la Rosa), obtaining an amnesty to allow their return from exile (1832, first restricted and then extended in 1833) to support the succession of the king's only daughter, Isabella. The Carlist group, clearly absolutist, supported the application of the Salic Law, which provided for the succession of the king's younger brother, Charles. The evidence of the need for mutual support between the moderate liberals and the Elizabethan aristocracy made it possible to find a possible expression of the common ideology, far removed from any extremism. Among his adversaries, this exchange of favours, conciliation or convergence of interests around an equidistant position was called pasteleo, a term popularised to such an extent that it became an offensive synonym for moderantism itself, and the moderates were called pasteleros; while Martínez de la Rosa was nicknamed Rosita la pastelera and Barón del bello rosal (Baron of the beautiful rosebush). \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Political agenda ==\nHaving become a true political party of elites with a presence in the provinces and an effective propaganda apparatus, they won the elections of 1834. The founders of the party at that time have been described as the best generation of conservative liberals of the Spanish 18th century: Antonio Alcalá Galiano, Francisco Javier de Istúriz, Andrés Borrego, Antonio de los Ríos Rosas, Martínez de la Rosa, Joaquín Francisco Pacheco and Nicomedes Pastor Díaz.\nThe moderates remained in power for much of the reign of Isabel II (moderate decade, 1844–1854, and the period 1856–1868), resorting to military pronunciamientos when necessary, led by their chief swordsman, Narváez. From the government they had the opportunity to develop the programmatic principles of moderantism, identified with the Constitution of 1845, which maintained a balance of power between king and parliament that was much more favourable to the monarch than the Constitution of 1812 and even the Constitution of 1837. A small group of moderates in favour of continuing with this document (on the grounds that it benefited consensus and political stability) was contemptuously accused of puritanical prejudices by Narváez, who ignored them, and from then on they became known as Puritans or Puritan dissidents; led by Joaquín Francisco Pacheco and Pastor Díaz, they had personalities such as Istúriz, José de Salamanca, Patricio de la Escosura and Claudio Moyano, and the support of Generals Manuel Gutiérrez de la Concha and Ros de Olano, and they would end up joining the most moderate of the progressives in the strategies of the Liberal Union led by General Leopoldo O'Donnell.\nA strong restriction of suffrage was forced by economic criteria, reserving it for the wealthiest; and a policy of public order was promoted, entrusted to a newly created body, the Civil Guard. Moderantism was markedly centralist, reducing the municipal powers that the progressives sought to expand; and it maintained an economic policy favourable to the interests of the Castilian-Andalusian landowning oligarchy (depending on the circumstances, between protectionism and free trade), which in fiscal matters translated into a greater indirect tax burden (consumption, paid by all) than direct (contributions, paid in relation to wealth). The tax reform of 1845, carried out by Alejandro Mon y Menéndez and Ramón de Santillán, perpetuated this fiscal system.\nConservative in social and religious matters, the Spanish moderates did not seek the separation of Church and State, but rather a redirection of the anticlerical policy of the progressive liberals, which took shape in the Concordat of 1851. The Spanish Catholic Church continued to enjoy a preponderant role in public life, respecting its privileged position in education and guaranteeing its economic survival after having been deprived of its sources of wealth with the confiscation. By means of the cult and clergy budget, the State was obliged to pay the salaries of priests and bishops and to maintain the immense real estate patrimony that still remained under its control. Ideologically, the so-called neo-Catholics represented the right wing of moderantism, seeking a difficult balance between Catholicism and liberalism, which for their opponents was a simple masking of traditionalist, ultramontane or reactionary positions.\n\n\n== Canovism ==\nDuring the revolutionary six-year period the moderates only obtained a marginal parliamentary representation, but the role of Cánovas del Castillo was decisive for the return of Alfonso XII as king, reorganizing that political space in what during the Restoration would be called the Liberal-Conservative Party, which would take turns in power with the Fusionist Liberal Party of Sagasta. The Constitution of 1876 would include a good part of the moderate political ideology, which from then on would be known as conservative or Canovist.\n\n\n== Moderados ==\nThe centrist nature of moderantism meant that, in addition to the moderates who were so from the beginning of their political or intellectual careers, some of the most outstanding personalities in this political and ideological sphere came from the ranks of their political adversaries. Some followed a political path to the right, coming from the exalted liberalism or from the different progressive groups; others, a path to the left, arriving at moderantism coming from Carlism.\nIn addition to those mentioned above, the following can be mentioned:\n\nThe long-time Agustín Argüelles, Conde de Toreno and Diego Muñoz-Torrero (who were liberals in the Cortes de Cádiz and moderates since the Trienio -see also \"anilleros\"-).\nNicolás María Garelli, important jurist.\nJavier de Burgos (designed the provincial division still in force).\nFelipe Sierra Pambley, Minister of Finance.\nJacinto de Romarate.\nPedro Agustín Girón.\nDiego Medrano y Treviño.\nNarciso Heredia y Begines de los Ríos.\nBernardino Fernández de Velasco.\nPedro Egaña.\nPatricio de la Escosura (went from the Moderate Party to the Progressive Party and later to the Liberal Union).\nJuan Bravo Murillo.\nFrancisco Javier Girón.\nDiego de León (military man opposed to Espartero, he was shot after failing in a pronunciamiento).\nCándido Nocedal (evolved towards neo-Catholic positions and approached Carlism).\nManuel Gutiérrez de la Concha.\nJuan Álvarez de Lorenzana y Guerrero.\nJosé de Posada Herrera.\nClaudio Moyano (initially progressive, he criticized the confiscation of Madoz and moved to the moderate ranks, and in the Restoration, to the conservatives of Cánovas).\nLuis González Bravo (initially progressive, came to head the moderate government characterized by the harshest repression in the final period of Isabella II, and approached the Carlists, already in exile).\nJuan Valera.\nFernando Calderón Collantes (parliamentary speech in defense of the census suffrage, 1844).\nFrancisco Agustín Silvela y Blanco.\n\n\n=== Press ===\nThe history of the press in Spain was characterized in the 19th century by the predominance of the party press, the newspapers being clearly aligned with a certain political position, although none of them was exactly an official organ. Among the media identified as being aligned with moderantism, both in Madrid and in the provinces, were:\n1820-1823:\n\nEl Censor.\nEl Universal.\n1833-1836:\n\nLa Abeja, founded and directed by Joaquín Francisco Pacheco.\n1836-1840:\n\nEl Porvenir.\nEl Correo Nacional.\n1840–1843\n\nEl Heraldo.\nEl Sol.\nEl Castellano.\nEl Conservador (Weekly magazine on politics, science and literature -Puritan group-)\n1843-1854:\n\nEl Heraldo.\nEl Correo Nacional.\nLa Época.\nEl Diario Español.\n1854-1856:\n\nLa España.\nEl Parlamento.\nLa Verdad.\nLa Época.\nEl Diario Español.1856-1868:\nLa España.\nEl Conciliador.\nLa Época (Sold by subscription only, by the aristocratic Unión Liberal).\nOther moderated newspapers and magazines, no period indicated:\n\nEl Vapor (Barcelona).\nEl Guardia Nacional (Barcelona).\nEl Papa-Moscas (Burgos).\nLa Correspondencia de España.\nLa Colmena.\nEl Redactor General.\nEl Mundo.\nEl Eco del Comercio (in other sources it appears as a progressive newspaper -Fermín Caballero-.).\nRevista de España y del Extranjero.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Advocate and family guardian (former names, Advocate of moral reform, Advocate of moral reform and family guardian,, and Advocate and guardian; 1835–1941) was an American periodical published semi-monthly by the New York Female Moral Reform Society and its successor, the American Female Guardian Society, characterized as a \"pioneer child-saving institution in the U.S.\". The first number appeared in 1835 and the last, in volume 109, number 6, in June 1941. Initial publication took place at 29 East 29th Street, in New York City. The Advocate, a continuation of McDowell's Journal, went through several name changes: Advocate of moral reform (1835–47), The Advocate of Moral Reform and Family Guardian (1847–49), finally, The Advocate and Family Guardian from 1849 until it ceased publication in 1941.\n\n\n== Advocate of moral reform ==\nAfter the formation of the Society, and previous to his illness, John Robert McDowall (1801–1836) had discontinued the publication of his Journal, and given to this Society, his list of subscribers, with whatever payments were due-but with no restrictions-a gift that afterward proved of special service in establishing a new paper, under different auspices, and in no sense, identified with any previous publication.\nThe first work of the Society was the establishment of a semimonthly paper, the Advocate of moral reform, which should be an exponent of their principles, and an organ of communication with the public. Still young in years, timid, unused to business beyond the confines of home, the leaders in this work had much to learn in a new sphere of duty, where wisdom, skill, and efficiency were indispensable. Pecuniary resources they had none, and how to prosecute their enterprise without embarrassment was an unsolved problem. But they were encouraged by the approval of their husbands and pastors.\n\nIt was designed to be the ally and defender of virtue, and to hold up before the world as their prominent aim, \"Remedy if practicable, Prevention by every possible Christian endeavor\". It was to be also an agency for procuring funds to carry forward the work. The first few numbers of the Advocate enlisted sympathy and co-operation among Christian women in the U.S. The Advocate was issued monthly and widely distributed, a vigorous correspondence carried on. From a paper of December 1, 1835, comes the following:— \"The present number of the Advocate concludes its first year. We entered this field from an impressive sense of duty. To do good, to save the youth of our beloved land from crime and ruin, has been our only object. All the funds which the public have placed at our disposal have been faithfully expended in sustaining the Advocate, or in other efforts to advance the cause. That our paper has done good, we have the most unquestionable testimony. It has drawn the attention of virtuous females to hidden moral evils; it has called into existence about fifty auxiliary associations; induced many a parent to impart instruction to his children upon a subject vastly important, yet hitherto neglected. Should our labors in this cause end here, we feel that we have done what we could to stay the progress of that moral pestilence, which threatens alike the morals of our children and the fair institutions of our country.\"\nBy 1837, the Advocate stated it had 16,500 subscribers, which made it the most widely-read periodical in the U.S. at that time. The issue of that paper of June 1, 1837, showed that 200 auxiliary bodies were connected with the Female Moral Reform Society, and that about 15,000 women were \"all pledged to the great principles of Moral Reform.\" The Advocate denounced \"the sickly sentimentality which for reasons of supposed delicacy ignores ugly facts.\" An article in this publication, April 15, 1837, estimated, as the result of an investigation, that the number of \"notoriously abandoned females\" in U.S. cities was at least 150,000. When the Advocate  denounced writings which \"corrupt the taste, seduce the heart through the senses and pollute it through the medium of imagination which they have made wild, restless and uncontrollable,\" its purpose was to breed wholesomeness of mind.\nAfter the lapse of years, and in view of the enlarging sphere of the Society, disapprobation of its title, even among its friends, was expressed, as calculated to arouse prejudice on the one hand, and on the other, not sufficiently to define its aims.\n\n\n== Advocate of moral reform and family guardian ==\nIn reply to these objections, the editor remarks, in the closing issue of 1846, \"The Society and its friends have never regarded the term 'Moral Reform' as implying exclusively and specifically the reformation of the abandoned. Far otherwise; with them it signifies reform in public sentiment, reform in social customs; in a word, reform in whatever is erroneous in belief or practice coming within the scope of the Divine command relative to purity of heart and life. Such is the Moral Reform' they advocate, and they do it, having for their chief end and aim, to prevent moral evil, and to warn the young and unfriended to flee from temptation before their steps slide, and ruin overtakes them. The other objection, viz.: that the term 'Moral Reform' is not sufficiently definite, we admit to be just, and wish to remedy. The work of the Society has greatly enlarged since the name was given to their paper, and many of the exposed and needy have now come to look to it rather as a guardian institution. Its field of usefulness, as hitherto, will be mainly in the family circle. Here lie the rising hopes of our country. Let the domestic hearth be sedulously guarded, and kept pure, as it may be, from the taint of moral evil, and a generation of the pure in heart, blessed of Heaven, and prepared to see God, will yet live to bless the earth.\"\nFrom that date the paper was called The Advocate of moral reform and family guardian.\n\nAfter many years of work in the interests of the Society, as Corresponding Secretary and editor of its paper, Sarah R. Ingraham Bennett's health failed, and the paper passed into the hands of Helen E. Brown, the executive committee still retaining the oversight of its publication.\nCommunication with the Southern section of the country being interrupted by the civil war, the subscription list became greatly lessened, and other circumstances tended to reduce the circulation of the Advocate. The most prominent of these was the multiplication of religious periodicals, and especially the journals advocating its peculiar principles, for as \"Homes for the Friendless\" arose in large U.S. cities, most of them also had a paper to plead its cause.\n\n\n== Advocate and family guardian ==\nThe name was subsequently abbreviated to Advocate and family guardian.\nIn 1877, Geo. P. Rowell and Co.'s American Newspaper Directory reported that the periodical was sixteen pages long, each page measuring 9 by 12 inches (230 mm × 300 mm). The cost of a  subscription was US$1 and circulation was estimated to be 10,000.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nS. R. I. Bennett, editor from 1842 to 1867\nHelen E.

It was funded by a K40,000,000 sponsorship deal with the Salima Sugar Company.  The first gameday was due to take place at the Griffin Saenda Sports Complex in Lilongwe, but it was postponed, as the venue had not yet been completed.  The competition instead debuted in 2023, with the first event taking place in Salima.  The tournament was suspended for several months due to a lack of funds, but following the receipt of additional money from Salima, it was completed in October, at the Don Bosco Netball Court in Lilongwe.\nThe teams taking part in the first competition were:\n\nAirforce\nBlue Eagles\nCivo\nDiamonds\nEkwendeni Resource\nImosys\nKaronga Queens\nMafco\nPrison Sisters\nTigresses\nTremors\nYoung Eagles\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Kington Town Hall is a former municipal building in the High Street in Kington, a town in Herefordshire in England. In the 1970s, the building was split into three units, with shops on the ground floor of two of the units, and the remainder of the complex converted for residential use. All three of the units are Grade II listed buildings.\n\n\n== History ==\nA market hall was commissioned by the lord of the manor, Philip Hollman, in the mid-17th century: it was a timber-framed building designed by John Abel, which was completed in 1654.\nBy the early 19th century, the market hall had become dilapidated: it was demolished, and a new town hall was commissioned by the then lord of the manor, Edmund Watkins Cheese.  The new building was designed and built by Benjamin Wishlade in the neoclassical style at a cost of £500, using some materials from the old building, and was completed in 1820. It was originally tile-hung but, in 1841, on instructions from the then lord of the manor, James Thomas Woodhouse, the tiles were removed and replaced by slates.\nThe design of the complex involved an asymmetrical main frontage in three sections facing onto the High Street. The right-hand section of three bays incorporated elements of the earlier structure dating back at least to the 18th century. It was three storeys high. The first two bays were fenestrated by sash windows on all three floors and were flanked by Doric order pilasters on the upper floors. There was a doorway in the right-hand bay which was blind on the upper floors. The section was surmounted by an entablature and a cornice. The central section was four storeys high. It was fenestrated by sash windows on all four floors and was flanked by Corinthian order pilasters on the upper floors. The section was surmounted by an entablature and a pediment. The central and right-hand sections were given a stucco finish.\nThe left-hand section of two bays was originally constructed in a different style and was only integrated into the complex and given a stucco finish in the early 20th century. After the Kington local board and sanitary district authority was replaced by Kington Urban District Council in 1894, the new council used the town hall as its offices. The complex remained in that use throughout the first half of the 20th century, but it ceased to be the local seat of government when the council moved to Mill Street in around 1960.\nIn the 1970s, the complex was then deemed surplus to requirements, converted into three separate units, and was sold for alternative use. The right-hand section, designated No. 2, was given a shop front on the ground floor with residential accommodation above; the central section, designated No. 3, was converted for residential use, while the left-hand section, designated No. 4, became a branch of Barclays with residential accommodation above. The left-hand section then became a shop when Barclays closed its branch in 2016.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Black Hand Association/Society (Egyptian Arabic: جمعية اليد السوداء, romanized: Jam'ia al-Yad al-Sawda') was one of the irregular armed organizations that arose in Egypt in order to resist the British occupation. It was founded out of the secret apparatus of the 1919 Egyptian Revolution and led by Abdel Rahman Fahmy. It was known as the Assassination Group (جماعة الإغتيالات). One of the first missions of that group was to kill Prime Minister Mahammad Sa'id Pasha, who was a danger to them at that time.\nThe period of the 1919 revolution witnessed a state of national movement in Egypt, where the “Black Hand” and “Blue Shirts” movements, which were affiliated with the Wafd Party, and the “Green Shirts” group, which were affiliated with Young Egypt, were founded. The secret group began with the 1919 revolution and took its name from the Black Hand organization, which was launched in Serbia during World War I, was formed and a major committee was formed that included members, the most important of whom were Ahmad Bey Maher and Abdel Latif al-Soufani, whose mission was to identify the figures to be assassinated.The assassination of Sir Lee Stack was the biggest blow to the group after it was proven that a number of members of the association were involved in the incident. It caused problems for the Wafd government headed by Saad Zaghloul, which was the first national government, and the incident caused its resignation. The Egyptian police then made a number of arrests and many of its members fled. While many of them remained in secret and the organization was not revealed until many years later.\n\n\n== Establishment ==\nHistorians have not inferred the time of the founding of the Black Hand Society, as there are no historical documents proving this because it worked in secret. Some sources indicate that the name of the society “Black Hand” was inspired by a secret organization bearing the same name that was founded in 1911 in Serbia by secret officers. Those who killed King Alexander I and his wife in Belgrade in 1903, and it is the same association to which the Bosnian Serb student Gavrilo Princip belonged, whose assassination of Austrian Crown Prince Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife during their visit to Sarajevo on June 28, 1914, caused the outbreak of World War I.This association was headed by lawyer Abdel Halim al-Bili, Abu Shadi Bey, Sheikh Mustafa al-Qayati, Sheikh Mahmoud Abu al-Oyoun, and a number of students. This association sent threatening letters to reactionary politicians, such as Youssef Wahba Pasha, the Prime Minister of Egypt from November 19, 1919, until May 20, 1920, to whom the association sent a threatening letter written in bright red ink bearing the sign of a black hand, a cannon, and the word Fedayeen.According to the book Heroes of the Secret Service of the 1919 Revolution by the writer Sabri Abu al-Majd, there was a student called Sayyid Pasha who studied at the teachers’ school and joined with his colleagues to a revolutionary group after the arrest of Saad Zaghloul, and that he was the founder of the Black Hand group, and his way of doing so was to make friendships with a number of railway workers, he used railway workshops and factories to manufacture completely primitive bombs, which could work by placing chemicals that would cause an explosion.The group was working to supply bombs and weapons for many of the operations of the secret apparatus of the revolution. It was a pistol and then it developed into 4 pistols and 4 bombs, but that was not enough to confront the enormous English development at that time.Sayyid's mission was not limited to supply, but he was able to manufacture the first weapon in the revolution, to fill the gap of resistance to the British, as he formed a committee accompanied by Ahmad Abdel Hay Kira, and they thought about increasing weapons by chemically manufacturing bombs, so they brought a book in the English language, and they devoted themselves to studying it. They translated it, then brought the materials needed to manufacture the first bomb in the 1919 revolution.\n\n\n== Activity ==\nIn historian Ahmad Qasim's writings of Ali al-Haddad, one of the organization's members, he said that he was close to two people, al-Nuqrashi and Ahmad Maher, the latter of whom was an assistant to Abdel Rahman Fahmy, founder and director of the Secret Service, and one of Ahmad Maher's roles was to recruit young men and join the Black Hand, which increased its activity by planning political assassinations following the military court's ruling death sentences imposed on 51 Egyptians in Minya and Asyut, and the sentence was executed for 34 of them, including the Bakbashi Mahammad Kamel, the sheriff who led the Asyut Revolution, in addition to the execution of 3 Egyptians who led the al-Wasti Revolution in Faiyum.\nMustafa Amin said: \"There is nothing in Saad Zaghloul’s correspondence with Abdel Rahman Fahmy that indicates that Saad was the one who instructed these assassinations, but at the same time we do not find in Saad Zaghloul’s secret instructions a single word about that he does not approve of these assassinations. Rather, the wording of the secret letters that Abdel Rahman Fahmy was sending it indicating that he was carrying good news to the leader of the 1919 revolution, and that he was calling the one who tried to assassinate the Prime Minister as having a nationalist spirit.\"The Black Hand group was sending threatening letters to politicians whom the revolution considered loyal to the English, and the Black Hand financed its activities by collecting money. The association had an organized system against the British, and members of the Black Hand formed internal committees. The first committee vowed and threatened employees and merchants with death if they did not participate in the strike by closing down their stores.\n\n\n== Internal organization ==\nThe Black Hand group had relationships with several committees, namely:\n\nNational Defense Committee: Most of the members of that committee were members of the Black Hand. The purpose of that committee was to incite public opinion against the government, and to incite the people to practice violence against authority.\nUrgent Committee: The purpose of this committee was to arouse public opinion, and it received financial assistance from Abdel Rahman Fahmy Bey. It was headed by Hassan Nafi and Ibrahim Abdel Hadi.\nThe Free Egyptian: This association derived its funding from Abdel Rahman Fahmy, and al-Rafi’i mentioned that it published a secret newspaper called al-Masry al-Hur (the free Egyptian) and had its own secret printing press. As the latter mentioned, people were eagerly receiving its bulletins and taking turns to look at them. The English General Belvin issued martial law, which considered this a crime, and any person in possession of a bulletin or some type of such bulletins was also committing a crime against martial law.\nThe Flame (al-Shuala): It was headed by Morcos Hanna Bey and Naguib Ghali Pasha.\nHigher schools: Most of its members were students. A paper was seized in which the law of this association was written, which includes a commitment to secret work, and that the members are busy issuing leaflets and urging a strike, and that the association will continue until the last English soldier leaves Egypt. Among its tasks are seeking to discover government secrets and threatening traitors. The Higher Schools Association was writing down a list of the names of English merchants with the intention of boycotting them.\nRevenge Association: This association was formed following the return of the Milner Committee from Egypt on January 17, 1920. It was divided into three sections: The first section was concerned with distributing leaflets. This section wrote letters to Lord Milner, Sir Valentine Chirol, and the ministers, and the leaflets were printed in a printing press. It was called Abi al-Azaim Press; The second section was the Pistols Department, and it had American-made pistols and pistols of a type called “Black Mountain.” As for the third section, it was the bombs section, and it was headed by Hosni al-Shentanawy, along with Helmi al-Jayar and others. The bombs were made in an Izba near Giza.\nCouncil of Ten Association.\nAssociation of the fifty.\n\n\n== Notable members ==\nThe group became famous for the joining of many well-known figures or who became known later, the most prominent of whom were the group's leader, Abdel Rahman Fahmy, Ahmad Maher, al-Nuqrashi  and Ibrahim Abdel Hadi, who later became prime ministers in Egypt. Journalists also joined, including Abbas Mahmoud al-Aqqad. There are also members of the group who achieved a distinguished position. Some of them are famous: Ahmad Abdel Hay Kira, Dawlat Fahmy, and Abdel Qader Shehata, whose names have appeared in books and works of art.\n\n\n== Sir Lee Stack incident ==\nIn 1924, the political arena witnessed the peak of tension after the clash between Prime Minister Saad Zaghloul Pasha and King Fuad I was repeated. The Sudanese issue was the background frame for this scene, and the angry masses in Sudan at that time were chanting the unity of Egypt and Sudan, while the English authorities wanted to separate Sudan from Egypt, and for this reason a national movement was formed in Sudan to support Saad Zaghloul's position in confronting the British occupier of Egypt. The movement bore the name “White Brigade” and was led by Sudanese officer Ali Abdel Latif.\nAl-Latif al-Muswarah magazine published that the crisis between Saad Zaghloul, who refused to separate Sudan from Egypt on the one hand, and the king and the British occupation on the other side, prompted Saad to submit his resignation to the king on June 29, 1924, but the king rejected it, and Ali Abdel Latif was arrested on charges of conspiring to overthrow the regime. The assassination of Sir Lee Stack was the biggest event that shook Kingdom of Egypt and the United Kingdom together on November 23, 1924. The momentous incident occurred at two o’clock in the afternoon on Wednesday, November 19, after the Sirdar of the Egyptian Army and the Governor-General of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan left his office at the Ministry of War, heading to his home in Zamalek. After he finished his work, five people waited for him and threw a bomb near his car and fired 7 bullets, seriously wounding the Sirdar in his abdomen, and seriously wounding the Yawar and the driver Frederick Hamilton March. The Sirdar died in the middle of the night following the accident. The perpetrators had fled and the driver of the car that was waiting for them was arrested.\nThe newspapers published the details of the incident and the text of Saad Pasha Zaghloul's statement addressed to the nation, in which he described the incident as one of the most severe and heinous atrocities and one of the worst impacts on the country's reputation and fame. The incident put Saad Zaghloul's government in a dilemma and he appealed to the Egyptians that anyone who knows something should submit it to the Public Security Department. The driver of the taxi in which the perpetrators were traveling was arrested, and he stated that they rode as ordinary passengers.\nAfter that, Saad Zaghloul's government resigned, and the new ministry was headed by Ahmad Zeiwar Pasha, in which Ismail Sedqi Pasha held the portfolio of the Ministry of Interior, which announced a reward of 10,000 pounds for guidance of any of the perpetrators. Seven men were arrested, some of whom belonged to the Black Hand Association, and the court sentenced them to death by hanging in 1925. The pistols used were identified through a pioneering instance of bullet examination by forensic scientist Sydney Smith.\n\n\n== References ==",

She was chief dietitian at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston, and president of the American Dietetic Association from 1922 to 1924.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nSmillie was born in Santa Fe, New Mexico, the daughter of Edward L. Hall and Addie (or Ada) Loomis Hall. She graduated from Colorado College in 1913.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSmillie taught music in Colorado as a young woman. She was head dietitian at Boston's Peter Bent Brigham Hospital when she started the hospital's nutrition clinic in 1921. She was elected to a two-year term as president of the American Dietetic Association in 1922, succeeding Mary deGarmo Bryan. She presided over the association's 1923 annual meeting in Indianapolis and the 1924 annual meeting in Boston. Under her leadership, the association established a permanent central office.\nIn her later years, Smillie was active in the Massachusetts Dietetic Association, trained Red Cross dietitian aides during World War II, and traveled with her husband, an epidemiologist who established a school of public health in Brazil.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1919, Octavia Hall became the second wife of widowed physician and Harvard Medical School professor Wilson George Smillie. They raised four children together, including two children from his first marriage. The Smillies retired to Newfane, Vermont in 1958, and ran a sheep farm. She died in 1970, at the age of 81, in Vermont.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKathleen Marie Scott, \"Recipe for citizenship: Professionalization and power in World War I dietetics\" (Ph.D. dissertation, College of William and Mary, 2009).",

        "content": "Daniel Myśliwiec (born 19 November 1985) is a Polish professional football manager and former player who is the current manager of Ekstraklasa club Widzew Łódź.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nMyśliwiec played football at amateur level, before moving to Kraków to attend university. After completing his studies in 2009, he became a player-manager of Klasa A club Strzelec Frysztak. Myśliwiec was remembered in Frysztak for a level of commitment and preparation unusual for amateur level football, conducting in-depth tactical and set-piece training, giving pre-match debriefs, as well as procuring pre-match clothing for his players, and, when necessary, maintaining the pitch.\nHe left the team in December 2010 to intern as a coach for Escola Varsovia Warsaw, before joining Legia Warsaw's academy in 2011. After five years with Legia's youth teams, he joined their senior technical staff as a match analyst in 2016. On 28 July 2017, he moved to Górnik Łęczna to operate as an assistant in Tomasz Kafarski's staff, later working with head coaches Bogusław Baniak and Sławomir Nazaruk. In 2018, he took on the same role at Chojniczanka Chojnice, working under Przemysław Cecherz and Maciej Bartoszek.\n\n\n=== Lechia Tomaszów Mazowiecki ===\nOn 29 December 2018, he took on his first professional managerial role when he took charge of III liga club Lechia Tomaszów Mazowiecki. He managed the team in 17 league games, winning nine times, drawing and losing four games each, before leaving at the end of the season to join Jacek Zieliński's staff at Arka Gdynia as an assistant.\nAfter leaving Arka on 31 October 2019, Myśliwiec rejoined Lechia the following day on a six-month contract. After just five matches in charge, the III liga season was suspended indefinitely on 12 March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and he left the club at the end of his contract.\nDespite short stins, Myśliwiec left a good impression in Tomaszów Mazowiecki; he was later remembered by former Lechia players for a similar level of commitment that he had previously shown in Strzelec; servicing the pitch, hosting thorough one-on-one talks and introducing mandatory nutrition for both senior and youth players. On 16 September 2023, when visiting Lechia to observe Widzew's upcoming opponents, Concordia Elbląg, he was greeted by the club management and former underlings, while home fans chanted his name during the game.\n\n\n=== Wólczanka Wólka Pełkińska ===\nOn 4 July 2020, III liga club Wólczanka Wólka Pełkińska announced the appointment of Myśliwiec. At the end of his tenure, Wólczanka was placed 5th in their group with 11 wins, 3 draws and 6 losses.\n\n\n=== Stal Rzeszów ===\nOn 19 December 2020, Myśliwiec moved to II liga club Stal Rzeszów. In his second season in charge, he led Stal to a league title and promotion to I liga.\nAfter finishing the 2022–23 campaign in 6th and losing in the first round of promotion play-offs, Myśliwiec announced he would be leaving the club at the end of the season. He terminated his contract by mutual consent on 14 June 2023.\nShortly after his departure from Stal, he joined Legia Warsaw's staff for their pre-season camp.\n\n\n=== Widzew Łódź ===\nOn 5 September 2023, Myśliwiec signed a two-year deal to become manager of Ekstraklasa club Widzew Łódź, replacing the outgoing Janusz Niedźwiedź. On 17 September, Widzew defeated Cracovia with a 2–0 scoreline in Myśliwiec's first game as manager.\n\n\n== Managerial statistics ==\nAs of match played 7 April 2024\n\n\n== Honours ==\nStrzelec Frysztak\n\nKlasa A Dębica: 2009–10\nStal Rzeszów\n\nII liga: 2021–22\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Beacon Point is a permanent public artwork by George Trakas in Beacon, New York. Located on the Hudson River waterfront the work was inaugurated in 2007 by the Dia Art Foundation and built in collaboration with Scenic Hudson and Minetta Brook. Beacon Point was previously listed as one of Dia's sites they manage but is no longer considered as such.\n\n\n== Design ==\nBeacon Point is situated in the Peter J. Sharp Park within the larger Long Dock Park, in Beacon, New York. the 23-acre Long Dock Park was an abandoned railroad marine landing before its adaptation into a public park by Scenic Hudson.\nLocated on the north side and western tip of the park's peninsula, Beacon Point consists of a series of decks, pathways, and stairs constructed of both steel and wood. Dia describes these elements as, \"a series of gradual cascading steps which recall the forms of undulating waves.\" These curving and undulating forms step down into the Hudson River, interacting with the rivers currents and tidal changes.\nThe most prominent feature of Beacon Point is a diagonal steel channel dividing the curving boardwalk. This lightly sloping channel flairs at each end forming curving steps which allow the river water through. The Architect's Newspaper notes that the surrounding boardwalk is, \"studded with a whimsically large number of concrete footings.\"\nBeyond this channel The artwork also includes a terraced angling deck, a boardwalk, a restored bulkhead, and a restored southern shoreline of the peninsula.\nTrakas states he designed the work “to play with the existing environment.” While the structure is designed for humans to enjoy, muskrats, crabs, and a variety of fish are noted as using the space as well.\n\n\n== History ==\nDia Art Foundation and Scenic Hudson began discussions with George Trakas in 1999 about opportunities to create water-access in relation to the construction of the nearby Dia Beacon art museum. Over the next several years Trakas worked with the environmental organization Scenic Hudson and the public art organization Minetta Brook to integrate his work with the overall design and environmental remediation of the chosen location, a peninsula jutting out into the Hudson. Trakas described the condition of the peninsula when he first saw it in a New York Times article with :\n\n “When I got here it was totally overgrown. There were just mounds of weeds, poison ivy, locusts. There were little trails that led out to this point, but the point at high tide was full of water. At low tide it was the exposed stumps of pilings and a lot of industrial refuse.”\nIn 2001 the peninsula underwent a large-scale clean-up of debris and brush and tree pruning. Shortly after this clean up the Trakas designed boardwalk and steel deck were installed. The full artwork was inaugurated as a permanent public artwork six years later, in October 2007, by the Dia Art Foundation.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Beacon Point at Wikimedia Commons\nScenic Hudson's website for Long Dock Park",

        "content": "Kathryn E. Fort is an attorney, author, professor, director the MSU Law Clinic at Michigan State University College of Law, Associate Director of the Indigenous Law and Policy Center, and runs the Indian Law Clinic. She is considered a national expert on ICWA. Fort teaches American Indian Children & the Law, Indian Law Clinic courses I and II. Fort started the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) Appellate Project. \n\n\n== Education ==\nFort earned a Juris Doctor degree from Michigan State University College of Law in 2005. She graduated Magna Cum Laude and received the Dean King Scholarship as well as the Indian Law Certificate. During Fort's time at the university, she also served as the Vice President of the Native American Law Student Association from 2004 to 2005. Before this, Fort attended Hollins University in Virginia and graduated Magna Cum Laude with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history with Honors in 1999.On December 1, 2016, Fort was given The Outstanding Alumni Award from Adrian High School, in Adrian, Michigan for her work in Native American law. She was in the class of 1995.\n\n\n== The Indian Child Welfare Act Appellate Project ==\nThe managing director of the Indian Child Welfare Programs at Casey Family Programs, approached Professor Fort in 2011 to participate in a program that aimed to measure compliance with the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) through court observations. Fort put together a pilot project with her law students to observe child welfare hearings in Ingham and Wayne Counties with the initial stipend. The purpose was to determine if the court proceedings were in compliance with ICWA. \nIn an article stating Fort had conducted research and gained experience in filing appeals cases, she observed that tribes that had access to a dedicated appellate attorney were more likely to succeed in their appeals. The article explained that most tribes do not have access to such attorneys. Fort proposed the establishment of a legal center for the Indian Child Welfare Act to Casey Family Services, proposing the Clinic could be utilized to develop best practices in ICWA appellate cases. Students could be engaged to draft either amicus or principal briefs in ICWA cases. Fort initiated the Indian Child Welfare Act Appellate Project in 2015, providing pro bono legal services to tribes in Indian child welfare proceedings.\nThe program offers an opportunity for students to develop their legal research skills and prepare appellate briefs and policy papers for tribal governments and organizations. The faculty provides close supervision to ensure the quality of the work. This work can potentially benefit the tribes and provide students with experience. According to Fort, the training that her students receive in the program is distinct from anything they have encountered in law school before joining the Clinic. Since 2015, the program has taken on increasingly complex ICWA cases often involving state Supreme Court and federal court litigation related to ICWA.\nThe Indian Child Welfare Appellate Project has four main areas of focus: tracking appellate cases nationwide, providing representation for tribes in ICWA appeals, providing technical assistance and research for tribes in trial and appellate ICWA cases, and providing training for jurists and other legal professionals on ICWA.\nIn 2020, the American Indian Law Journal published data from fifty states collected by the ICWA Appellate Project, stating that annually, there are an average of 200 appellate cases dealing with the Indian Child Welfare Act.\nWith all the positive outcomes ICWA has helped accomplish for outcomes in child placement, Native children are still more than twice as likely than other children to be placed in non-Native households. One of the challenges are the limited access to dedicated child welfare in-house attorneys. Fort's work is ongoing, and her student's experience to carry into their own careers. Some of whom are in-house attorneys, many are themselves Native and work with their tribes.\n\n\n== Tribal Representation: The Circuit and Supreme Court Of The United States ==\nFort has provided direct representation to tribes in the Washington, Colorado, and Michigan Supreme Court, the Ohio, Illinois, and Tennessee Court of Appeals, the Second, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Ninth U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeals, as well as the Supreme Court Of The United States. More recently she obtained significant funding to start the Tribal Appellate Clerk Project which, as part of the Indian Law Clinic, allows law students to assist tribal appellate courts by providing research and memos on appellate tribal cases.\n\n\n== Defending the Indian Child Welfare Act ==\nFort and the ICWA Appellate Project work on numerous cases involving child placement. ICWA is a federal law that states [qualified] Native children are not to be placed in foster care without the court  involving the tribe or tribes to which they belong. ICWA requires they be placed with a family member, which qualifies uncles, aunties, a grandparent, extended family, and kindship network. This keeps the children connected to their culture. \nIn the American Indian or Alaska Native culture, the concept of family encompasses more than just blood relations. It includes fictive and non-fictive kin, extended family, tribal community and the larger American Indian nation. This signifies that an individual is never isolated and always has the backing of a vast network of family and kinship connections. \nIn 2018, when two siblings were removed from their home and parents told the court about their Native heritage in order to qualify their two children as Indian (valid terminology specifying a child is American Indian or Alaska Native), however, ICWA was not applied. The judge determined that there was not enough \"reason to know\" the children were Indian under the law.The children were placed in non-Native foster care without the protections of ICWA to keep them connected to kinship, family, and their culture. The Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska intervened 30 days later, and from that point forward the Indian Child Welfare Act was then applied to the case. Fort argued on behalf of the tribes who challenged the case in the Washington State Supreme Court. \nThis was important for the parties involved. If the court's decision would have been upheld, the use of ICWA compliance in the removal and placement of children would have been greatly effected by setting some precedence. The article interviewing Fort wrote, \"The burden of checking in with a tribe is low, she says, but the outcome has immense implications for the family, children and tribe.\" Looking past the issues of law, Ford expressed \"“to find no ‘reason to know’ there’s an Indian child involved when you’re literally looking at Indian people in the courtroom — it makes no sense.” \nThe US Bureau of Indian Affairs published ICWA guidance for courts in 2016, responding to   interpretations of \"reason to know\" suggesting “expansive” interpretation of the law, meaning that this needs to be considered carefully and, [when in doubt], find that there is a “reason to know.” \n\n\n== Haaland v. Brackeen ==\nIn October 2017, the Brackeen federal lawsuit case was filed in the federal District Court in Fort Worth. The Indian Law Clinic, under the leadership of Kathryn Fort, worked with Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP represented the intervening tribes. Later, the law firm Jenner & Block also joined as co-counsel. The primary objective behind their intervention was to ensure that the Native voices were heard and represented fairly when the court ultimately decided the case.\nHaaland v. Brackeen was noted by many as \"the most important\" Indian Child Welfare Act case in history or in generation. As director of the Indian Law Clinic, Fort represented tribes who had appealed a federal judge's ruling in Texas that declared the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) unconstitutional in 2018. She had been preparing for several months, expecting that the Supreme Court might significantly alter or completely dismantle the law. \nAn article in Propublica, a non-profit investigative journalism organization was published just days after SCOTUS upheld the Indian Child Welfare Act in Haaland v. Brackeen by a 7–2 vote. \"I was shocked,\" said Fort. When referring to the people opposing ICWA, Fort commented, “The messaging has really come through that people who are removing Native children from their family and culture, you're not doing good things for Native people.\" Fort remains outspoken in listing items that would represent significant progress. For native people and their children, Brackeen represented a significant victory.\n\n\n== Working Toward Nation Wide ICWA Compliance ==\nAccording to Fort, there has been no adequate tracking by the federal government to ensure that states adhere to ICWA guidelines. The national database that provides insights into the outcomes of the child welfare system, the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS), does not gather information on whether ICWA covers the children.\nThe Obama administration's rule aimed to track trends in ICWA-eligible cases' outcomes by modifying the collection method for AFCARS data. This system had a category for tribal citizenship and dozens of other data points. However, in 2020, the Trump administration withdrew those updated guidelines, leading to a lawsuit that argues the decision was unjustified, and Fort's clients have been involved ever since.\nThere are many articles that write about the challenges faced in today's courts with regards to Native children and ICWA compliance. Madeline Soboleff-Levy, general counsel of the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska was quoted in a PBS new article, saying \"A tribe’s very existence is dependent on having future citizens,\" and, \"The tribes’ existence as a cultural entity and sovereign government depends on those citizens having connections with their community and having a sense of who they are.\"\n\n\n== Notable Recognition ==\nFort was recognized for her \"significant contributions to Haaland v. Brackeen and her support of tribal courts,\" and awarded the \"2023-2024 Outstanding Service Award\" by the National American Indian Court Judges Association.\nThe Association of American Law Schools (AALS) named Prof. Ford \"AALS Litigation Section Practitioner of the Year\" for her \"pivotal role in the landmark case, Brackeen v. Haaland.\" During the event, Professor Nicole Godfrey commended Professor Fort's unwavering commitment towards protecting Native children through the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA). Professor Fort has been defending the ICWA against challenges to its constitutionality in state and federal courts across the country since 2009, when she filed a brief in the Michigan Supreme Court on behalf of the American Indian Law Section of the State Bar of Michigan.\nSeptember 8, 2021, Fort received the 2021 Tecumseh Peacekeeping Award from the American Indian Law Section of the Michigan State Bar\n\n\n=== Media Commentary ===\nFort has commented on an assortment of cases in the media as an expert in ICWA, and her knowledge of Indian law and experiences with her appellate project. NBC News wrote \"Tribal courts can hear custody cases involving their citizens — even if there are existing orders in place from another court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit ruled.\" This appeal was won after kidnapping conviction, when a mother - a member of Cheyenne River Sioux, took her children to the South Dakota reservation, breaching a joint custody order. Fort's commented, \"In this case, the tribal court decided it was necessary to claim jurisdiction over the case, but the laws of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and the states of North Dakota and South Dakota factored into how it ended up in federal appellate court,\" and added \"I don’t think the sky is falling regarding custodial interference.”\n\n\n==== ICWA ====\nThe SCOTUS case had heard arguments in Halland v. Brackeen, hoping to overturn the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978. An article reported that \"Native children are overrepresented in the foster care system, and critics of the law have said that its preferences are problematic because there are more Native children in foster care than there are Native homes to place them in. But Kate Fort, director of the Indian Law Clinic at Michigan State University, said that courts must consider the child’s best interests, which in this case happens to include a child’s connection to their tribe, culture and community.\"  \nIn another report on the above mentioned case, Fort, who represented the defending tribes said, \"tribes have more than 200 years of legal history, including treaties and other major precedent-setting cases, that have outlined and codified this political relationship with the federal government.\"Another report discussing Matthew McGill's view of \"the real injustice of [ICWA],\" replacing the test (the individual assessments in regular adoption hearings) with \"with a hierarchy of preferences.\" Fort answered, \"ICWA doesn't prevent an individualized assessment of the best placement for each child,\" and adding \"I personally don't know a state court judge who would be comfortable being told that they weren't allowed to do an individualized assessment.\" And, when explaining the process, Fort told NPR that this individualized assessment includes consideration of the child's relationship with her relatives, her language, her religion, and her tribal tradition. \nSpeaking about ICWA, \"In 1978, when the law was enacted, 1 in 4 Native children was in the child welfare system; the overwhelming majority — 99 percent — were living in non-Native homes,\" said Kathryn Fort.\n\n\n== Notable Legal Publications and Contributions ==\nThe Road to Brackeen: Defending ICWA 2013-2023, 72 AMERICAN U.

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The De opificio mundi (On the Creation of the Cosmos) is a treatise on the Genesis creation narrative (Genesis 1–3) by Philo of Alexandria, a first-century Jewish philosopher. It is the first surviving example of a genre of literature known as the Hexaemeral literature, although it was not the first to have ever been written, and Philo in many cases relied on earlier works in the Alexandrian school of biblical exegesis, such as the commentary of Aristobulus of Alexandria. This work also appears, with one exception, as the first text in all collected editions and translations of Philo's works (with one exception) since the edition by Turnebus in 1552. In addition, among Philo's works, the Opificio was second only to his Legum allegoriae in its popularity. Reasons for this included its wholesale dedication to the topic of the creation of the world, its offering of the first monotheistic reading of the Timaeus by Plato (opening the way for its further use by the Church Fathers and Christian Platonism in later periods), the way it elaborates an image of the divine architect, and its Logos theology.\nPhilo also wrote other commentaries on the Pentateuch, including his Allegorical Commentary on Genesis and his Questions and Answers on Genesis and Exodus, for which the Opificio served as an opening treatise. It is thought that Philo composed the Opificio sometime between 30 and 40 AD, when he was in his fifties.\nThis work is not to be confused by another work of the same name, namely, the De opificio mundi of John Philoponus.\n\n\n== Influences ==\nPhilo was working within an existing Jewish tradition of commentary and exegesis of the books of Moses, such as the earlier (and now lost) writings of Aristobulus of Alexandria. Philo also cites some of his colleagues as well as earlier philosophers like Plato, although he rarely refers to them and, when he does, usually not by name. Baudouin Decharneux has argued that Philo's doctrine of divine powers (δυναμεις) was influenced equally by biblical and Greek (primarily Platonic) ideas.\nBecause of the lost nature of many of the works that Philo relied on or worked in the tradition of, his extensive extant writings, including the Opificio, have been used to help reconstruct them.\n\n\n== Genre ==\nIn his subsequent writings, Philo repeatedly retrospectively calls the Opificio a συνταζξις, referring to an \"ordered composition\" and may be understood as a didactic or systematic prose work in contrast to a speech or a dialogue. In addition, it is well-accepted that this work, alongside some of Philo's others, constitutes a commentary on the books of Moses. Furthermore, the Opificio was one member of a much larger set of works by Philo that are referred to as the Exposition of the Law. This work reflected Philo's conception of the tripartite nature of the Pentateuch, insofar as it could be divided into a first section on creation (for which the Opificio was dedicated), a second part on history, and a third part on legislation (such as the Decalogue).\n\n\n== Structure ==\nAccording to Runia, the structure of Philo's Opificio can be divided into twenty-five chapters as follows (with the symbol §§ denoting the term \"sections\"):\n\n§§1–6. Introduction.\n§§7–12. Preliminary comments on God and the cosmos.\n§§13–15a. Comments that the six days are not literal but simply denote the order of creation.\n§§15b–25. Day one.\n§§26–28. Comments that \"In the beginning\" refers to what God did first, as the first temporal moment.\n§§29–35. Seven main components of the cosmos according to Gen 1:1–3.\n§§35–37. Second day.\n§§38–44. Third day.\n§§45–52. Fourth day: comments on the relationship between the number of the day (four) and what was created on this day.\n§§53–61. Fourth day: the creation events.\n§§62–68. Fifth day.\n§§69–71. Comments on why man is made in God's image.\n§§72–76. Why did God use helpers to create (according to Gen 1:26)?\n§§77–88. Why was man made last?\n§§89–128. The relationship between the Sabbath and the number seven.\n§§129–130. Summarizing reflection on Gen 2:4–5a.\n§§131–133. On the separation of fresh water from salt water.\n§§134–135. On the making of man from the Earth.\n§§136–147. The excellence of the first human being.\n§§148–150. Man naming the animals.\n§§151–152. The origins of woman and the quest for bodily pleasure.\n§§153–156. Interpretation of events in the garden.\n§§157–166. Interpretation of the snake.\n§§167–170a. The consequence of wickedness.\n§§170b–172.

He served as the third feudal lord of the Izushi Domain in Tajima Province, and later became the first feudal lord of the Sonobe Domain in Tanba Province. Yoshichika was the founder of the Koide clan, which belonged to the Yoshichika line.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in Osaka in 1590, Koide Yoshichika was the second son of Koide Yoshimasa and his mother was the daughter of Ito Haruaki. In 1598, Yoshichika was appointed as Jugo-shi Shimo Kaga no Kami by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. In 1603, he changed his title to Shinano no Kami and paid respects to Tokugawa Ieyasu in Edo. In 1605, he attended an audience with Tokugawa Hidetada in Kyoto. In 1610, he was granted a fief of 2,000 koku in Kanra District, Ueno Province. After his father's death in 1613, Yoshichika inherited part of his brother's Ishikijyo Castle and his father's estate, ruling over 29,700 koku and becoming a daimyo. During the Winter Siege of Osaka in 1614, he participated in the attack at Tennoji Gate with his brother. In the following year, he took down over three hundred enemies during the Summer Siege of Osaka and participated in capturing Toyotomi supporters. He presented 67 enemy heads in total. In 1619, Yoshichika was transferred to Sonobe, Tanba Province, ruling over 28,000 koku in four districts and establishing his rule there. He died in 1668 in Sonobe at the age of 79. He was laid to rest at Kotokuji Temple in Shimotani.

        "content": "Kid Kapichi is an English punk rock band formed in Hastings in 2013. The band consists of vocalists and guitarists Jack Wilson and Ben Beetham, bassist Eddie Lewis and drummer George Macdonald.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2013, Jack Wilson and Ben Beetham began writing music together. After they finished their first song \"Ice Cream\", their friends from school Eddie Lewis (bass) and George MacDonald (drums) joined the band and played their first concerts in Hastings. In the following years, the band released several singles and EPs before touring Europe in 2019, first at the Reading and Leeds Festivals and then as support for Frank Carter & The Rattlesnakes. On February 5, 2021, the band self-released their debut album This Time Next Year. On 26 March 2022, the band opened for Liam Gallagher at London's Royal Albert Hall. Gallagher personally invited the band after hearing their song \"New England\", praising it on Twitter.\nIn June 2022, Kid Kapichi were signed by Spinefarm Records. On 23 September 2022, they released their second studio album Here's What You Could Have Won, which features Bob Vylan the song \"New England\". The album entered the UK Albums Chart at number 38.\nIn fall 2023, they toured North America supporting Nothing but Thieves. Their third studio album There Goes the Neighborhood was released on 15 March 2024, with the song \"Zombie Nation\" features Suggs as a guest singer. The album peaked at 90th on the UK Albums Chart. The album release was followed by a headlining tour through Europe.\n\n\n== Style ==\nJames Wilkinson of AllMusic described Kid Kapichi as a \"rough, establishment-challenging quartet inspired by U.S. alt rock while staying true to their British indie punk roots\". Singer Jack Wilson cited bands such as the Arctic Monkeys, The Libertines, Queens of the Stone Age and Rain City Drive as their primary influences. Wilson's vocals have also been compared to Mike Skinner and Liam Gallagher.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nThis Time Next Year (2021)\nHere's What You Could Have Won (2022)\nThere Goes the Neighborhood (2024)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nKid Kapichi (2017)\nLucozade Dreams (2018)\nSugar Tax (2019)\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Between August 23 and 24, 2020, militants from RED-Tabara attacked the city of Bugarama, Burundi, killing eleven civilians and five militants.\n\n\n== Background ==\nRED-Tabara was formed as a Tutsi group against the administration of Évariste Ndayishimiye and Pierre Nkurunziza. Following Nkurunziza's death a month after the 2020 Burundian general election, Ndayishimiye succeeded him and took office in July 2020. RED-Tabara decried the elections, and stated they would continue to oppose Ndayishimiye. In late August, the first repatriation of Burundian refugees from Rwanda began. The Burundian government had accused Rwanda of holding the refugees hostage and preventing their repatriation in July and August.\n\n\n== Attack ==\nThe attack began on August 23, when RED-Tabara militants emerged from the forest around Bugarama and kidnapped eleven people. The commander of the militants later stated that they infiltrated Burundi from the DRC's South Kivu province through Lake Tanganyika. The eleven hostages were summarily executed, and then clashes broke out between the militants and the Burundian Army in the city. Five militants were killed in the battle, and eventually retreated. A senior Burundian government official stated that the attack likely stemmed from the repatriation of the refugees. RED-Tabara claimed responsibility for the attack on August 24, after clashes had died down earlier that day, and claimed that nine policemen and twenty \"militants\" had been killed. In the statement, RED-Tabara claimed that Hutu rebel group FDLR had infiltrated Burundian forces.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nRED-Tabara claimed several more attacks in Burundi on September 15, 18, and 25, claiming the deaths of fifty-nine people who they alleged were associated with the Burundian government. Several RED-Tabara militants, including the commander of the Bugarama attack, were arrested in Rwanda on September 29. They claimed that the Bugarama attack was against Burundian forces and Imbonerakure.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "San Giovanni Evangelista is a Neoclassical-style,  Roman Catholic parish church, located on the piazza of the same name in the center of the town of Ponsacco in the province of Pisa, Tuscany, Italy.\n\n\n== History ==\nThis church was designed by Alessandro Gherardesca, was begun in 1823, and consecrated in 1836. The symmetric sober facade has well defined elements: two central pilasters have niches with statues. A central arched door has a taller pediment and is surmounted by a rose window. The three entrance doors define the central nave and two aisles. The detached Neo-gothic architecture bell-tower, built between 1862 and 173, rises some 36 meters, but has a subtle lean. In 2014, the bell tower underwent restoration.\nThe interior was extensively frescoed in the 19th and 20th centuries. In the dome, are frescoes of the Theological virtues (1829) by Giuseppe Bacchini. In the spandrels, are depictions of the Four Evangelists (1912) by Vincenzo Ceccanti (1871–1916). The flat ceiling of the nave has frescoes depicting the Martyrdom of St John the Evangelist and Vision of the Apocalypse (1848) by Ezio Marzi (1875–1955); another Apocalypse by Gaetano Sarti; and a Crucifixion (1950) and Holy Year 1950 by Luigi Antonio Gaioni (1889–1966). The Chapel of the Madonna della Neve has a statue of the Madonna and Child attributed to  Benedetto da Maiano and a modern fresco depicting the Assumption of the Virgin (1959) also by Gaioni. The church putatively has the relics of St Constance Martyr, derived from the Roman Catacombs of Callixtus. The organ was made by Agati family in 1836.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Anson Street African Burial Ground is a recently rediscovered historic cemetery and archeological site where enslaved people of African descent were buried in 18th-century Charleston, South Carolina, United States. The burial ground was in use from approximately 1760 to 1790. The graves were uncovered during the 2013 excavation of a trench for the construction of the Galliard Auditorium. Initial impressions were that the bodies had been buried in four closely aligned rows, oriented east to west, all lying near the corner of Anson Street and George Street. Grave goods included British coins, one of which was found in the eye socket of a skull. The remains of a wooden coffin and buttons from what was possibly a boy's coat were also unearthed.The previously unmarked remains will be the site of a memorial sculpture featuring \"a fountain ringed with bronze hands, all modeled from Black residents of similar ages to the 36 people found\".Efforts to identify the origins of the buried people include DNA research, to identify genetic background, as well as isotope mapping, to pinpoint geographic locations for the birthplaces of persons from this and some other sites, as part of an ambitious project to get more insight into the trans-Atlantic slave trade.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Dreamstar Lines is a privately-owned passenger railroad company based in Newport Beach, CA. Dreamstar is planning a nightly inter-city service between Los Angeles and San Francisco. The train would share the same routes as Amtrak, Metrolink, and Caltrain. Service is anticipated to launch as early as 2025, succeeding the Lark that ended in 1968.\n\n\n== History ==\nJake Vollebregt created Dreamstar Lines in Newport Beach, CA. By 2023, Vollebregt publicized plans for an overnight “hotel train” as an alternative to flying, reviving a service that had discontinued 55 years prior. In April 2024, Joshua Dominic assumed leadership of the project. That month, Dreamstar signed a memorandum of understanding with Union Pacific Railroad to operate trains on its right-of-way.\n\n\n== Service ==\n\n\n=== Overview ===\nUnder Dreamstar’s current proposal, two trains, one headed north and one headed south, would run every night, departing from each terminus at 10:00 p.m. and arriving at their final destination the next day at 8:30 a.m. This schedule is similar to the red-eye travel in aviation. The trains would have intermediate station stops and crew turnovers near each end of the route.\nDreamstar's trainsets would consist of restored, historic bi-level cars. Onboard amenities include two sleeping arrangements; private rooms with lie-flat beds and premium bedrooms; a lounge, and breakfast delivery. Dreamstar’s tentative plan would also allow passengers to transport their automobiles on the train, an accommodation derived from Amtrak’s Auto Train.\nDreamstar is expected to commence service in summer 2025.\n\n\n=== Route description ===\nUnder the plan, Dreamstar would operate between the Union Station in Los Angeles and the 4th and King Street station in San Francisco. The train would travel through California’s Central Coast region on a railroad known as the “Coast Line”, which is owned by Union Pacific and also serves Amtrak’s Coast Starlight and Pacific Surfliner. Other portions of Dreamstar’s planned route coincide with Metrolink’s Ventura County Line between Los Angeles and Montalvo, and Caltrain’s corridor between Gilroy and San Francisco. Dreamstar’s service retraces Southern Pacific’s Lark that ran from 1910 to 1968, as well as Amtrak’s short-lived Spirit of California.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCalifornia High-Speed Rail\nCoast Starlight\nSpirit of California\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDreamstar Lines Official Website",

        "content": "Dávid Vitézy (born 1 December 1985) is a Hungarian economist, transport and urban mobility expert, politician, who served as Secretary of State for Transport in the Fifth Orbán Government for a brief time from May to November 2022. He is a candidate for Mayor of Budapest in the 2024 Budapest mayoral election.\nHe was a prominent member of the NGO Urban and Suburban Transport Association (VEKE) from 2000 to 2010. He was inaugural CEO of Centre for Budapest Transport (BKK) between 2010 and 2014. He was ministerial commissioner overseeing the development of public transport, especially the coordination of regional and long-distance relations within the Ministry of National Development for some months in 2015. He served as director of the Hungarian Technical and Transport Museum from 2016 to 2022. Simultaneously, he was CEO of Budapest Development Center (BFK) from 2020 to 2022.\n\n\n== Family and studies ==\nVitézy was born into a family of Jewish origin in Budapest on 1 December 1985, as the son of film director László Vitézy (1940–2024) and his third wife, social psychologist and MEP Ágnes Hankiss (née Erdős; 1950–2021). His maternal grandfather was Péter Erdős (1925–1990), the controller of pop music life during the Goulash Communism, and maternal grandmother was Erzsébet Köves (1927–1989), literary historian and secretary of 1956 martyr Géza Losonczy. The first husband of his mother was sociologist Elemér Hankiss (1928–2015). His paternal uncles are entrepreneurs András Vitézy and Tamás Vitézy. The latter's daughter is Rita (Dávid's cousin), spouse of actor and theater director Rodrigo Crespo (born 1973). One of Dávid's half-siblings is Zsófia Vitézy, the Hungarian Ambassador to Colombia since 2022. She is maternal cousin of Viktor Orbán, the Prime Minister of Hungary. That is why, contrary to the assumptions, Dávid Vitézy is not related by blood to Orbán.\nVitézy graduated from Lauder Javne Jewish Community School in 2004. He graduated in economics from the Faculty of Economics of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME), majoring in regional settlement and territorial development, in 2010.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nAt the age of 15 in 2000, Vitézy was a founding member of the Urban and Suburban Transport Association (VEKE), an NGO with the aim of improving public transport in Hungarian cities and representing the interests of passengers. He was a board member of the organization from 2002, \nthen head of the association's transport development working group until 2010. Beside that, he functioned as spokesperson of the VEKE from 2006 to 2010. He had a prominent role in the fact that the night transport of Budapest was completely transformed and significantly expanded in 2005 with the introduction of the 900 number series night bus services. He also actively spoke out against the planned reductions in public transport routes.\nThe opposition party Fidesz delegated Vitézy as a member of the supervisory board of the Budapesti Közlekedési Zrt. (BKV), serving in this capacity from January 2007 to December 2009. As a member of the committee, he was the initiator of several internal investigations that led to the outbreak of later corruption scandals involving the city governance of Budapest under Mayor Gábor Demszky and Deputy Mayor Miklós Hagyó. During his activities, he was attacked several times, according to which he acts according to party political interests since his mother was a Fidesz politician. However, VEKE supported his efforts in this regard. Vitézy left the organization in 2010, following the 2010 Budapest Assembly election, when Fidesz candidate István Tarlós was elected as mayor.\n\n\n=== CEO of BKK ===\nTarlós appointed Vitézy as the CEO of the newly established Centre for Budapest Transport (BKK) in November 2010. He held this position until December 2014. Under his leadership, BKK was responsible for public transport, bicycle and pedestrian transport, road infrastructure management, city parking, the regulation of taxi services and the implementation and organization of European Union projects related to transport. Under his mandate as CEO, the reorganizations and the comprehensive institutional reform of Budapest transport, which was launched when the company was founded with a team of 1,800 experts together with colleagues taken over from various Budapest companies (FKF, BKV, etc.), were completed successfully. Under Vitézy's leadership, BKK's achievements include the compilation of the Mór Balázs Plan, the new long-term sustainable mobility plan for Budapest.\nDuring these years, the complete reconstruction of tram lines 1 and 3 was carried out, with the creation of grassed tram tracks in several places in Budapest in a previously unknown manner in Hungary; beside that the route of tram line 1 was also extended. BKK's own project was the realization of the interwoven tram network in Buda by connecting the separate tram lines and creating a new barrier-free infrastructure. In connection with this, the Széll Kálmán tér was completely renovated and expanded. An important result is the launch of the MOL BuBi public bicycle system in 2014 with more than 1,000 shared bikes. Additionally, BKK launched a comprehensive new vehicle procurement program, which marks the introduction of a hundred new modern low-floor buses, trolleybuses and trams into service in Budapest.\nUnder Vitézy, BKK successfully coordinated the launch of the new M4 metro line, including related infrastructure developments: a new bus station, P+R parking lots, public spaces and junctions were also established. In 4 years, BKK led by Dávid Vitézy produced a 20% increase in revenue from ticket sales with a 10% reduction in season tickets. The opening of modern integrated customer centers in several busy junctions has brought a significant quality change that is emblematic and directly perceptible to the traveling public. One of the most complex developments was the launch of the FUTÁR traffic management and passenger information system, which also made it possible to monitor the real situation of routes on a map. Route planning databases and real-time traffic data have become accessible to applications developed by third parties, including Google's travel planner. BKK installed 250 new ticket and pass machines throughout Budapest. Due to the Budapest Taxi Ordinance introduced in 2013 at the initiative of the BKK, the taxi service was reformed, as part of which the uniform yellow color was introduced for taxis, the option to pay by bank card was made mandatory in all vehicles, and strict quality and environmental protection standards were introduced.\nDespite all this, the personal relationship between Tarlós and Vitézy was strained. Following the 2014 Budapest mayoral election, when Tarlós was re-elected, Vitézy was dismissed as CEO of BKK on 3 December 2014. Tarlós argued that BKK under Vitézy lost its role and became an over-bloated, over-expanding, autonomous company that became independent from the General Assembly of Budapest. He ironically called Vitézy as a \"young, repressed genius and one-man mastermind legend\", who is \"almost impossible to work with because of his personality\", arguing that all the realized developments were included in Tarlós' 2008 urban development program. Vitézy was succeeded as CEO by Kálmán Dabóczi on 1 January 2015. VEKE president Lajos Dorner also claimed that Vitézy acted as a political actor at the head of a professional organization, who \"could not wait for opportunities to come, he wanted everything right away\". According to an investigative report from October 2017, the rise of Russian influence contributed to Vitézy's ouster, since the latter did not support the renovation of Russian metro trains for M3 metro line, instead he supported the purchase of completely new subway trains from Western Europe. The Russians conducted an active discrediting campaign against Vitézy, which eventually led to his dismissal. Dabóczi reported his predecessor for violation of trade secrets and illegal possession of data assets, but the prosecution rejected the charge.\n\n\n=== Later positions ===\nVitézy was appointed ministerial commissioner within the Ministry of National Development on 1 February 2015, overseeing the development of public transport, especially the coordination of regional and long-distance relations (MÁV and Volán). He held the position until 31 July in that year. Vitézy stated that his goal is to create a unified ticket purchase system that plans the route between any two settlements, regardless of the type of public transportation. Instead of merger of MÁV and Volán, Vitézy proposed the creation of an organization that jointly manages the two large transport systems as a customer, the purpose of which is to create a uniform timetable, tariff and passenger information system for passengers.\nVitézy became director of the Hungarian Technical and Transport Museum on 16 January 2016, which appointment was considered by the press to be pushed into the political background and Vitézy's marginalization. He served in this capacity until May 2022. However, the museum remained closed throughout under his management, after the main building was demolished in the City Park, but the selection of a new location was constantly postponed by the Hungarian government. Vitézy often spoke on transport policy issues in the following years. For instance, he criticized the disintegration of BKK in January 2016. He expressed his support in favor of the controversial proposal Budapest Museum Quarter. In addition to the criticism of the underground parking construction at József nádor Square, he protested against mayor István Tarlós' \"anti-bicycle measures\" and \"retrograde transport plans\" in April 2016. During a conference in May 2016, Vitézy supported the introduction of the congestion charge in Budapest and the development of suburban railway lines. He proposed that the pass system be extended to BuBi bicycles as well. Vitézy argued that Tarlós' management \"have turned away from the public transport oriented approach and want to return to the seventies\". He also spoke out against route reduction plans in August 2016.\nThe Fourth Orbán Government created the Budapest Development Center (BFK), a state institution coordinating governmental developments in Budapest and agglomeration, in early 2020. Vitézy was appointed CEO of the newly established organization on 21 January 2020. Vitézy emphasized that the BFK \"does not mean an alternative town hall\" against opposition mayor Gergely Karácsony, who was defeated Tarlós in 2019. According to him, in the following years, the most important issue will be the implementation of the so-called \"M5 metro line\" project (also known as \"north–south regional high-speed railway\", a connection of publi transport system from Szentendre to Ráckeve and Csepel through Budapest), a similar to the S-Bahn systems in Germany. Under his leadership, the BFK issued a tender for the complete renovation and modernization of the Budapest Nyugati station.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nAfter the 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election, Vitézy was appointed Secretary of State for Transport under Minister of Technology and Industry László Palkovics on 25 May 2022. Simultaneously, due to its increased powers, the BFK was transformed into a national organization under the name National Transportation Center (NKK). Vitézy chaired this organization on a temporary basis. Vitézy resigned as museum director in May 2022, following his appointment as state secretary. He was succeeded by Domonkos Schneller in the former position. The NKK was transferred to the Ministry of Construction and Investment under János Lázár in July 2022, and soon ceased to exist as an independent state institution. Lázár referred to the Russo-Ukrainian War and its consequent energy and economic crisis. Vitézy remained state secretary until the resignation of Palkovics in November 2022, which resulted the disintegration of the Ministry of Technology and Industry. Vitézy was succeeded as state secretary by Bálint Nagy.\nFollowing his resignation, Vitézy became a vocal critic of the transport policy of the Orbán government. In March 2023, he accused János Lázár of hindering the development of railway transport, citing that the minister scrapped the project of the planned expansion of the Nyugati station. In the summer of that year, Vitézy emphasized MÁV's outdated equipment, which are already endangering the continuous operation, especially for branch lines and regional lines. He sharply criticized Lázár's decision to cancel ten railway lines. According to Vitézy, MÁV \"became unable to provide the public service that the Hungarian state ordered from it\". In the same time, Lázár also suspended the implementation of several railway projects (e.g. Galvani bridge). Vitézy argued these steps go against the European trend and reduce Hungary's competitiveness. In January 2024, Vitézy strongly opposed the reductions of BKV routes, which Gergely Karácsony withdrew as a result of the protests.\n\n\n=== Candidate for mayor ===\nVitézy announced his candidacy to the position of mayor of Budapest in the upcoming local elections on 19 March 2024. In his introductory speech, he outlined the five biggest problems to be solved: housing and expensive sublets, continuous traffic jams from the outer districts and agglomeration, deterioration of health care, little green space and development always only reaches the inner, tourist-frequented districts. His candidacy was endorsed by opposition LMP – Hungary's Green Party. Gergely Karácsony and the left-wing opposition parties accused Vitézy of actually being the \"hidden\" candidate of Fidesz, citing his former positions and family relations under the Orbán governments. Karácsony considered Fidesz \"official\" candidate Alexandra Szentkirályi will withdraw in favor of Vitézy sometime during the campaign. Vitézy refused the allegations.\nVitézy campaigned to set up law enforcement on BKK lines against violent and homeless passengers, he would build 10,000 new service apartment and would banish party politicians from the boards of Budapest companies, where he would also introduce the one-third female quota. He also said that the opposition between the capital city and the countryside is an outdated and artificially stimulated phenomenon by politics. He argued the unsustainable increase in housing prices results in people moving out of the city, while abandoned \"rust zones\" await development. sixty percent of commuters from the agglomeration cross the city limits by car, which is a very bad ratio, Vitézy said. According to him, Budapest became a political battleground between the government and Karácsony since 2019, which resulted in the cessation of major investments and the halting of major developments. Karácsony uses his position as a \"national opposition\" and \"martyr\", according to him, even in such headwinds by the government, more could have been achieved during the five years, but there is no continuous negotiation between the two parties.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Francesca Primas is an Italian astronomer at the European Southern Observatory in Germany. Her research studies the historical evolution of chemical abundances in the Milky Way and its satellite galaxies; she is also known for her activism for improving the gender balance of professional astronomy.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nPrimas was a high school student in Gorizia, and studied astronomy at the University of Trieste, both in Italy. She earned a laurea (the Italian equivalent of a master's degree) in 1992, and completed a PhD there in 1995.\nAfter postdoctoral research at the University of Chicago in the US from 1995 to 1997, and at the European Southern Observatory from 1997 to 2000, she continued at the European Southern Observatory as a support astronomer beginning in 2000, became head of the user support department in 2006, and was promoted to full astronomer in 2015.\nIn approximately 2008, she authored a study of gender distribution among European Southern Observatory astronomers. The low representation she found, with only 18% of ESO astronomers identifying as female, sparked significant discussion and change at the observatory, and she became a co-founder of the observatory's Diversity and Inclusion Committee. She has also chaired the Working Group on Women in Astronomy of the International Astronomical Union (IAU), and directed an IAU project to publicize the work of over 600 women in astronomy.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nIn 2023, Primas was named as the inaugural recipient of the Nancy Grace Roman Award for Promoting Gender Equity of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mark Milbank JP DL (2 May 1795 – 21 October 1881) was an English landowner and Whig politician.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nMilbank was born on 2 May 1795 and baptised at Well, North Yorkshire. He was the eldest son of William Milbank and Dorothy (née Wise) Milbank. His father bought Thorp Perrow Hall, Snape Castle, and Snape village in 1798.\nHis father was born illegitimately and named William Melville at birth but had his name legally changed to William Milbank by Royal Warrant in 1792 in order for him inherit the estates of his father, Mark Milbank. His maternal grandparents were John Wise of Woolston, Devon.\nHe was educated at Harrow School from 1805 to 1813 before matriculating at Oriel College, Oxford in 1813.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHe succeeded to his father's estates in North Yorkshire in 1802, including Barningham Park, which had been home to the Milbank family since 1690. He was elected to Brooks's in February 1818. His wife, Lady Augusta, created the pinetum on the family estate.\nMilbank was returned for the borough of Camelford in 1818 on his father-in-law Lord Darlington's interest, but was unseated on petition. Two years later in 1820, however, he was returned unopposed. At the general election in summer 1822, Milbank and Sheldon Cradock, another nominee of his father-in-law, were returned for Camelford ahead of two candidates of The Earl of Yarmouth (who had to leave the House upon becoming the 3rd Marquess of Hertford).\nMilbank was a captain in the 4th North Riding Militia in 1814, a Lieutenant with the West Riding Yeomanry in June 1819, Captain in December 1819, before resigning in April 1820. He served as High Sheriff of Yorkshire from 1837 to 1838, as well as Justice of the Peace and Deputy Lieutenant of Yorkshire.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nOn 2 June 1817, Milbank was married to Lady Augusta Henrietta Vane (1796–1874) at St James's, Westminster. Lady Augusta was a daughter of William Vane, 1st Duke of Cleveland and Lady Catherine Powlett (a daughter of the 6th Duke of Bolton). Together, they were the parents of four sons and three daughters, including:\n\nMark William Vane Milbank (1819–1883), who married Barbarina Sophia Farquhar, daughter of Sir Thomas Farquhar, 2nd Baronet.\nFrederick Acclom Milbank (1820–1898), a Liberal MP for North Riding of Yorkshire and Richmond who was created a baronet in 1882; he married Alexina Harriet Elizabeth Don, daughter of Sir Alexander Don, 6th Baronet, in 1844.\nAugusta Caroline Milbank (1821–1889), who married Henry Foster Coore in 1841.\nHenry John Milbank (1824–1872), who married Lady Margaret Grey, daughter of George Grey, 8th Baron Grey of Groby and Lady Katherine Charteris (a daughter of the 8th Earl of Wemyss), in 1846. After her death in 1852, he married Lady Susan Osborne, daughter of George Osborne, 8th Duke of Leeds and Harriet Stewart (an illegitimate daughter of the 1st Earl Granville), in 1864.\nLady Augusta died in 1874. Milbank died on 21 October 1881. Upon his death, his estates passed in turn to his sons Mark and Frederick.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Patara Kartuli Anbani (Georgian: პატარა ქართული ანბანი) is a book which was published in Istanbul in 1914 to teach Georgians living in the Ottoman lands their language. The title of the book means \"Little Georgian Alphabet\" and is modeled on Georgian educator Iakob Gogebashvili's book Deda Ena.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe opening of a Georgian school in Istanbul is linked to the presence of a Georgian community in this city. The roots of this community is traced to the Byzantine period. Following Russia's oppression of Catholic Georgians in the Georgian lands captured from the Ottomans in the 1828-1829 Ottoman-Russian War, Istanbul witnessed a new Georgian migration in the 1860s. A Georgian monastery was founded by Catholic Georgians under the leadership of Petre Kharischirashvili in the village of Feriköy in Istanbul where Georgian language education and publications were carried out. The idea of opening a separate school for Muslim Georgians, or \"Ottoman Georgians\", emerged among the Georgian intellectuals who met in this monastery. Subsequently, permission to open a school was obtained from the Ottoman government. Patara Kartuli Anbani was prepared and printed for this school. However, in the same year that the book was published, World War I broke out and the opening of the school could not be realized.\n\n\n== Features ==\nPatara Kartuli Anbani was the first textbook published in Turkey for the purpose of providing education in Georgian. On its cover, it was stated in Georgian that the \"Little Georgian Alphabet was prepared and printed for the Ottoman Georgians. First Edition, Istanbul, Georgian Printing House, Feriköy, 1914\" (პატარა ქართული ანბანი, შედგენილი და გამოცემული ოსმალოს ქართველთათვის, გამოცემა პირველი, სტამბოლი, ქართული საბეჭდავი, ფერიქვევი, 1914). It is understood from this statement that the book was prepared for Georgians living in the Ottoman lands and was printed in the Georgian Catholic Monastery printing house. The name of the person who prepared the book is not mentioned. However, it is stated in a Georgian source that this book was prepared by Memed Abashidze, who escaped from oppression and took refuge with his relatives in Istanbul and fought for Georgians living in Turkey to receive education in their own language.\nPatara Kartuli Anbani is a short book of 16 pages and consists of two parts. The first part is divided into seven sections under the heading \"Lesson\" (გაკვეთილი). In these sections, letters of the Georgian alphabet and their pronunciation is taught. The second part consists of \"Texts\" (საკითხავი). There are eight short reading passages here. At the end of the book, the numbers are given one by one from 1 to 10, by tens from 10 to 100, and by hundreds from 100 to 1000. It is stated on the back cover of the book that the price is 40 para and that a more comprehensive textbook will be published with the proceeds from the sale.\n\n\n== Georgian letters and their Ottoman equivalents ==\nBecause the Georgian language has different phonemes than Turkish, some of the Ottoman Turkish equivalences of Georgian letters were indicated with double letters. It was also stated that some phonemes should be pronounced \"lightly\" (حفیف) and others \"heavily\" (ثقیل). 33 letters, five vowels and 28 consonants are given in the introduction of the book. In a note at the end of the page, it is stated that four other letters are used in Georgian language.\n\n\n== Notes ==",

        "content": "Montchat - /mɔ̃ʃa/ - is a district in the 3rd arrondissement of the French commune of Lyon. It forms the eastern part of the city. It ends on the east with a hill bordering Bron and adjoins Villeurbanne to the north.\nOn the Montchat estate, a simple country estate originally in Dauphiné, a fortified castle was built in the 16th century: Château de Montchat. Queen Christine was one of its guests. Later, in 1852, Lyon expanded and the 3rd arrondissement was created. It covers the entire area east of the Rhône. As a result, the commune of La Guillotière was absorbed, and at one of its extremities was Montchat, still sparsely populated. It was therefore in the mid-19th century that landowners responded to the demographic demands of the city center by urbanizing their estates. The subdivision plan established plots of a few hundred square meters in Montchat to keep industry out. This still leaves its mark on the neighborhood.\nNow a constituent part of Lyon, this neighborhood of around 14,000 inhabitants in 2013 retains a \"village spirit\". Small villas line streets named after the family of the first developer, Jean Louis Richard-Vitton. They are trying to resist real estate pressure. Its predominantly residential character means that the economy is geared to local needs. As a result, the area offers a wide range of services and shops. The concern for adequate facilities, present since its emergence, persists. As a whole, the neighborhood is self-sufficient.\nOf course, the château is steeped in ancient history, but the two green spaces in the heart of the urban area also hold memories of more recent times. However, the district doesn't live in the past and, as a testament to its dynamism, social activities have been thriving for a century.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nThe Montchat district, to the east of the Rhône, forms the eastern part of the commune of Lyon. It ends on the east with a hill bordering Bron and adjoins Villeurbanne to the north. It covers an area of approximately 1,420km2.\nMontchat, according to data from the Institut national de l'information géographique et forestière (IGN) and customary practice, is bounded by four virtually straight roads. To the north, these are the route de Genas, Villeurbanne; to the east, boulevard Pinel and rue du Vinatier, Bron; to the south, avenue Lacassagne, the Grange Blanche district; and the west, rue Feuillat, and the Sans-Souci-Dauphiné district.\nThis almost corresponds to the boundaries of the neighborhood councils, but excludes the Grange Blanche estate, which has a very different origin and future. From 1913 onwards, the Grange Blanche Hospital was built, which has since become the Édouard-Herriot hospital.\n\n\n=== Geology, relief, hydrography ===\n\nLyon lies at the confluence of three geographical regions and two rivers. To the west lies the Lyon plateau, to the northeast the Dombes and to the southeast the Bas Dauphiné plain. Montchat lies at the western end of the Bas Dauphiné plain and belongs to the eastern Lyon plain.\nThe Bas Dauphiné plain is a Tertiary complex made up of a sedimentary series several hundred meters thick. It is made up of marly sands and molasse - a Miocene marine transgression - remodeled by the dynamics of Quaternary glaciers, with characteristic mounds known as molards. The Miocene molasse of this plain is entirely covered by glacial formations, whether boulder moraines on the hummocks and knolls, or fluvio-glacial deposits that form a thick alluvial mass of pebbles, stony sands and sometimes clay deposits below. On the eastern plain, the Rhône rises to an altitude of 162 metres. From the Rhône eastwards, three topographical units follow one another. The first is an alluvial plain (Fy-z), followed by two fluvio-glacial terraces (Fx5V and Fx6G) and, finally, the moraines (Gx4) - known as buttes - deposited by glaciers. In Montchat, where the last two formations meet, we find the Butte de Bron, with a district rising from 178 to 208 meters. The highest point is Rue Ferdinand-Buisson, which runs alongside Bron's neighbouring Parc Chambovet.\nThe eastern plain is characterized by its high permeability and, at Montchat, there is no surface drainage network.\n\n\n=== Communications and transport ===\nThe beginning of the 21st century has inherited all the transport infrastructures. The vitality of the neighborhood is reflected in its development and the installation of new modes of transport.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\nAt the end of the 20th century, the legal structures governing public transport were transformed. The Compagnie des omnibus et tramways de Lyon (OTL) was succeeded by the Société des transports en commun de Lyon (TCL). This was later replaced by Société lyonnaise des transports en commun (SLTC), which became Keolis Lyon in 2005. Keolis is entrusted by the Syndicat mixte des transports pour le Rhône et l'agglomération lyonnaise (SYTRAL Mobilités) with the operation of the network.\nAgainst this changing legal backdrop, Lyon's tramway system was gradually phased out. On April 15, 1948, OTL closed line no. 25 in Montchat. On the same date, it modified the route of its standard-gauge line no. 28. Traction is electric. In Montchat, the route follows avenue Lacassagne to place Henri, then runs along cours Henri (now known as Docteur-Long), ending at the corner of cours Richard-Vitton. On June 1, 1951, line no. 2 closed, followed by line no. 28 on September 2, 1951. Bus routes take their place.\nSix years after the opening of the first line, the tramway returned to the district on December 6, 2006. On that date, SYTRAL opened line T3 (Part-Dieu-Villette station to Meyzieu-Z.I. station)11. It takes the former line of the Chemin de fer de l'Est de Lyon. It enters Montchat at the intersection of rue Feuillat and rue Félix (Dauphiné-Lacassagne station) and leaves it at the western end of cours Richard-Vitton (Reconnaissance-Balzac station). This line only skims the northwestern part of the district, and these two consecutive stations remain at its boundary. On November 17, 2012, SYTRAL opened the T5 line (Grange Blanche to Eurexpo)13. Only the Grange Blanche station, at the south-western end of the district, is connected to it. Here, there is an interconnection with the metro.\nFinally, on September 4, 1991, SYTRAL opened line D of the Lyon metro (Gorge-de-Loup to Grange Blanche). Grange Blanche station, although not part of the line, serves the south-western end of Montchat.\n\n\n=== Private vehicles ===\n\nThe number of cars in the neighborhood is high. In 2005, an estimated 61% of households owned a car, compared with 54% in Lyon, and 30% of households owned two vehicles, compared with 15% in the city. This has to do with parking difficulties. However, there are few accidents in this residential neighborhood, far from main roads and workplaces.\nWhile a car-sharing service has existed in the conurbation since 2008 - Autolib' -, On October 10, 2013 fully electric self-service cars became available - Bluely. Of Lyon's 51 initial stations, one is located in Montchat. According to some, it may add to the parking difficulties experienced in the neighborhood. A second station was installed the following year.\n42% of residents own a bicycle, while only 5% own a motorbike.\nOn May 19, 2005, Vélo'v, a self-service bicycle rental scheme, was introduced. In 2017, it had eight stations in Montchat. This environmentally-friendly mode of transport is also appreciated by users for its low cost. However, this comes at the price of more billboards to finance the operation and ten percent of the fleet immobilized due to sometimes careless use.\n\n\n== Urbanism ==\n\n\n=== Urban morphology ===\nRichard-Vitton's subdivision plan gave the main orientation to the alley leading to the château. The neighborhood was made up of small plots of a few hundred square meters each, served by a geometric network of narrow streets built from Rue Henri - now Cours Docteur-Long - parallel to the allée du château. This subdivision is dominated by two-storey pavilions, often associated with a service or craft activity. Today, these houses are still often surrounded by a small garden with a cedar or plane tree, and have a wisteria-decorated entrance. The district's original fabric of townhouses and small apartment buildings has been largely replaced by more recent, higher-rise buildings [but] the district center is set in the heart of a residential, largely planted fabric where densities remain relatively low\". However, \"the Monchat district is subject to strong land pressure, with numerous interventions over the past twenty years contributing to its deterioration\".\n\n\n=== Street naming ===\n\nIn 1990, Maurice Vanario, archivist for the City of Lyon, produced an odonymy of the streets of Lyon, in particular those of Montchat. On May 28, 2008, on the occasion of Montchat's 150th anniversary, Alain Richard-Vitton, a descendant of the founder, recalled the origins of the district and its street names.\n\n\n=== First names district ===\nThe first names of Richard-Vitton's sons and their spouses or ascendants are frequently found. However, there is no strict agreement with the civil registry; these are probably first names in use.\n\nRue Amélie: first name of the wife of Henry Constantin Marie's second son, Mlle Kœnig became rue Jean-Cardona in 1935.\nPlace and rue Antoinette: first name of Mrs. Richard-Vitton's mother.\nRue Camille: third name of fifth and last son.\nRue Charles-Richard: first name and surname of eldest son. Around 1860, it was named Rue Richard-Laforest, which links the two families since Charles Richard and Julie Laforest were married.\nPlace and rue Claudia: first name of Mrs. Richard-Vitton's maternal grandmother (actually Claudine (born Merle)). Became Rue Viala in 1913.\nRue Constant: middle name of second son (actually Constantin).\nPlace et cours Henri: first name of Mme Richard-Vitton's father (actually Henry), former mayor of La Guillotière became Cours du Docteur-Long, a resistance fighter, in 1945.\nRue Julie: first name of the wife of Charles Pierre's eldest son, Mlle Laforest.\nRue Julien: first name of third son.\nRue Louis: first name of fourth son.\nPlace Louise: first name of Mrs. Richard-Vitton.\nRue Louise: third name of a granddaughter of Richard-Vitton, daughter of Marie Charles Camille.\n\n\n=== Tributes ===\nThe family names are less specific. Some bear witness to the Richard-Vitton family.\n\nRue Besson: named after a great-grandmother of Mrs. Richard-Vitton. When extended, became rue Basse-Besson (before the farm, to the west), rue Besson, and rue Gérente (after rue Sainte-Marie, to the east). Acquired the name rue Ferdinand-Buisson in 1892.\nRue Bonnand: maiden name of Mme Richard-Vitton's mother (actually Bonand).\nRue du Capitaine: Julien Émile Richard, third son, was captain of the Rhône Mobiles around 1858.\nRue Chambovet: maiden name of Mr. Richard-Vitton's mother.\nCours Eugénie: tribute paid by Richard-Vitton to Empress Eugénie de Montijo, wife of Napoleon III.\nRue Kœnigsberg: a popular transformation of Kœnig bey, the Egyptian name and honorific title of Henry Constantin Marie's second son's father-in-law. Became Rue Piperoux before 1868.\nCours Richard-Vitton: initially, in 1858, simply Richard from the owner's civil status name. Then, on his donation in 1875, the town council honored the latter's customary name.\n\n\n=== Richard-Vitton course ===\nThe Cours Richard-Vitton begins at Place de la Reconnaissance and ends at Place Kimmerling, in the commune of Bron.\nNamed Cours Richard on the 1858 subdivision plan, this road is described as \"a path 1,212 meters long and 12 meters wide, laid out in a straight line in the Montchat district \". Valued at 21,000 francs, it was ceded free of charge by Mrs. Widow Richard-Vitton to the Lyon municipality, which accepted it on December 30, 1875 and designated it as \"chemin vicinal ordinaire no 154, dit cours Richard-Vitton\".\nAt present, this course is a shopping street, especially in the section between Place Antoinette and Place Ronde.\n\n\n=== Housing ===\n\nIn 1904, Montchat was considered a \"suburb of Lyon\", and remained so in 1934. By the end of the 20th century, the district was fully integrated into the city. The suburbs are located beyond the surrounding communes.\n\"The predominance of single-family homes, built without a master plan, makes it a sought-after village neighborhood.\" But the neighborhood's \"village spirit\" is proving hard to resist in the face of real estate pressure. In 2012, for the whole of Lyon, the Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques (Insee), indicated that 2.9% of residents lived in houses and 95.7% in apartments. In 2014, the borough mayor reported that \"there are now nine hundred and fifty houses in Montchat\". And according to him, single-family homes account for \"19% of Montchat housing, with 81% of people living in apartments\", so proportionally, single-family homes are about six times more common in Montchat than in the whole of Lyon.\nThese homes are occupied by a mature population. People aged 50 to 59 make up 14% of the population, whereas in Lyon they account for only 11%, and people over 60 make up 24%, whereas in the city they account for 19% of the population.\n\n\n=== Natural and technological risks ===\nThe Natural Risk Prevention Plan (PPRN), as of February 2009, clearly states that Montchat is not at risk of flooding. This situation, although not formalized in an administrative document, was already known at the time of the historic Rhône flood of 1856 in Lyon. This is one of the reasons for the urbanization of the district.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\n\nThe name of the locality is mentioned, probably for the first time, in 1479 in the form Montchal: \"[... ] et dudit carreffour nous [nous] transportasmes par le chemin par lequel on va de Lyon à Genas jusques au boys de Monchal et dudit chemin par ung autre petit chemin traversant le hault desdits boys de Monchal et tirant à ung carrefour estant au chemin par lequel on va de Lyon à Braon, appelé ledit carrefour le Rempaut de Chassaignes ouquel a une croix de bois estang en ung buisson; [...]\".Montchal can also be dated to 1700 or 1710 on the Plan général du bourg de la Guillotière, mandement de Béchevelin en Dauphiné, dedicated to Monsieur le marquis de Rochebonne, commander pour le roi dans le Lyonnois, Forez et Beaujolois by his most humble servant Mornand, syndic of the aforementioned town, which bears the name Montchal. At 1702, the Carte de la Guillotière et du mandement de Béchevelin [...] published by Bouchet, according to the 1479 survey, mentions Montchat as such. This is the current name.\nThis is a medieval toponymic formation in Mont- undoubtedly predating its first mention. Its interpretation is straightforward: it's Gallo-Romance MONTE \"elevation, height, hill\", derived from the accusative montem of the Latin word mons \"mountain\" or, more directly, from the Franco-Provençal mont \"elevation, hill, mountain\", which derives from it, given the uncertainty surrounding the date of the toponym's establishment.\nThe identification of the second element -chat is more problematic, given the scarcity of available early forms. In any case, it's not the animal, since it seems established that some old forms are of the Montchal type until the eighteenth century, which became *Montcha by apocope. As is often the case, the element *-cha having become opaque, was reinterpreted as -chat, after the animal, \"mont du chat\" making sense.\nMontchal is the name of several communes and hamlets in the region, including Montchal (Loire, Mont Chal 1225; Montchal 1312; Monte Chalmo 1352; Monte Chalme 1404; Montiscalm 1431), whose medieval Latin forms distinctly refer to a *calmis word meaning, on the plains: \"unproductive land, usually meadowland\". In the Pre-Alps and Alps: \"mountain pasture, above the forest limit, grassy summit, often difficult to access and sparsely vegetated\". It is considered pre-Indo-European by some and Gallic by others.\nRegularly, the [ka] group palatalized in Franco-Provençal, hence [t͡ʃa] then [ʃa] \"cha\". Thus *calmis is identified in the region as a toponymic element in the forms Cha, Châ, Chal, Chale, Chaume, etc. and numerous derivatives.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nMontchat was originally a wooded area on the left bank of the Rhône. However, for two millennia, the Rhône, which was difficult to cross, acted as a frontier. The future foundations of Lyon were on the opposite bank. This location meant that it belonged to the Viennese balmes and was therefore sheltered from the river's frequent flooding.\nThe left riverbank expanded, and in 1075 the church of Saint-Alban, dedicated to the early fourth-century martyr, was built. Its \"location appears to be the present-day Saint-Alban chapel at Montplaisir\". This is the church of the small village of Chaussagne, also known as La Chesnaie. Its highest point is known today as the \"Butte de Bron\". At the time, Chaussagne was one of three parishes in the mandement of Béchevelin (Bêche-en-Velin). This mandement proved to be strategic. Probably to defend a gateway to the city of Lyon, Archbishop Jean Belles-mains had the Béchevelin fortified castle built at the end of the 12th century. At the same time, the Guillotière bridge was built, gradually transforming La Guillotière into a suburb of Lyon62. From here, various communication routes led to the Genas road, which joined La Guillotière to Genas and formed the northern boundary of the estate.\nFrom August 13 to September 23, 1479, Louis XI commissioned commissioner Louis Tindo to geographically demarcate the territories of La Guillotière and the mandement de Béchevelin. Despite the territorial survey of 1339, commissioned by Humbert II, dauphin of Vienne, and aimed at selling his property, this mandement, located east of the Rhône and therefore in the Dauphiné, remained the subject of a dispute between the Grenoble parliament and the Lyon presidial. This is the first time that the name Montchal is mentioned as a locality in the village of Chaussagne- which belongs to the mandement of Béchevelin.\nAgriculture was also on the rise. This was not a traditional activity in the region due to the poor soil, but in the 18th century, it met the needs of the neighboring town.\n\n\n=== Castle occupants ===\n\nOn November 20, 1534, Loys Ennemond and Flory Prost, heirs of Pierre Prost, the first known owner of the estate, sold the Montchat lands, a total of 230 hectares, to Jehan Catherin, concierge of the Lyon prisons. Thus, \"a terrier [...] dating from 1534 and written in Latin, [...] specifies the name of the owner of this fief: 'Terrarium loci de Montchard Parochia Chaussagnae nobilis Jehan Catherin' which means: 'Terrier du lieu de Montchard de la paroisse de Chaussagne, à noble Jehan Catherin\"'. He had a fortified house built, which is now known as the château. The estate and fortified house then became the property of Gaspard and Jean de Laube, lords of Bron, who in turn transferred it to François Basset on March 19, 1638. Basset was one of Lyon's aldermen.\nChristine, Queen of Sweden, spent three weeks in August 1657 at the Montchat fortified house. This was her second trip to the French Court. Coming from the Court of Savoy, she wished to meet Mazarin once again to arrange a loan and secretly finalize the capture of the Kingdom of Naples, then in Spanish possession - since she had no heir, upon her death the Kingdom of France would install a Bourbon dynasty. The absence of any response to his letters made it uncertain how he would be received. This second trip was much less lavish than the first when the city of Lyon had graciously received her with great honors. She informed the Lyon consulate that she would cover the costs of her stay and leave it up to her to choose her place of residence. He asked Sieur François Basset to lend his home for the occasion - a pleasant place to stay in summer, given its location outside the town. The consulate received her courteously, greeting her on her arrival on August 9 and sending her daily gifts. Once again greeted by a representative of the consulate, the Queen of Sweden left Montchat on August 28, 1657 for Fontainebleau.\nFollowing this stay, the former alderman requested compensation for the damage caused to the vineyards and furniture by the illustrious host's retinue. Five hundred and fifty livres tournois were awarded.\nOn May 14, 1682, his son Jean-François Basset, \"écuyer, ci-devant maître des requêtes de la feue Reine, mère de Sa Majesté\", ceded, according to the notarized deed, \"the house, estate, and tenement of Montchat, size en la paroisse de cette ville de Lyon [... ] several buildings, courtyards, walled gardens, sown lands and others, vineyards, woods, meadows, located both near the house and in the place of Vilurbanne (sic) in Dauphiné, with all the said outbuildings, rights, and belongings of the said house\". The new owners are des Bernardins, the reverend fathers of the Congrégation de Notre-Dame des Feuillants, Order of Cîteaux, from the Saint-Charles monastery in the city of Lyon.\nOn January 3, 1689, the Fathers sold the land to Jacques Besson, after renting it to him for one year. The deed specifies the boundaries of Montchat's two hundred and thirty hectares. The property, worth nine thousand pounds and ten ecrennes louis, is \"bounded to the north by the Chemin de Lyon à Genas [now route de Genas], to the east by chemin Vinatier (since called boulevard Pinel), to the south by Chemin de Lyon à Saint-Laurent (avenue Rockefeller - Grande rue de la Guillotière), while to the west it reaches as far as the gates of La Guillotière\". This notary and royal councillor on rue Mercière in Lyon is the ancestor of all those who would later make up the history of Montchat.\nHis son Pierre had six children, including Louise, who married Mathieu Bonand on November 22, 1729. His son Luc was the last to bear the title of seigneur de Montchat et de L'Hormat. During the Terror, the estate was sequestered, then returned after the 9th of Thermidor. Antoinette Bonand, daughter of Luc, married Henry Vitton, future mayor of La Guillotière, on January 8, 1811. Louise Françoise Vitton was born of this marriage.\n\n\n=== Urbanization ===\n\n\n==== Actors ====\nIn 1831, Louise Françoise Vitton married Jean Louis François Richard son of Charles-François Richard, a pioneer in the industrialization of shoelace manufacture. In 1839, the latter's assets consisted of part of the capital of the Fabrique Richard frères transferred by his father. He soon sold his share and lived off his income. Richard associates his name with that of his wife, and deeds concerning Montchat appear under the initials \"Richard-Vitton\". He was deputy mayor of La Guillotière, to which the Montchat countryside was attached. Lyon then absorbed this commune on March 24, 1852. Succeeding M. Charbonnier, he became mayor of Lyon's 3rd arrondissement from 1857 to September 4, 1870, the date of the Lyon Commune. He died on February 22, 1874.\n\n\n==== Habitat ====\nAs part of an urbanization policy, this landowner decided to sell a large part of his land - seventy-eight hectares - and kept 174,564 m2 walled around the château, according to Mme Richard-Vitton's deed of gift-sharing dated October 31, 1883. In these parts and at this date, this approach is understood as \"a development left largely to the individual initiative of speculative owners concerned only with their local interests\".\nMonchat's elevated position was a popular feature after the Rhône flood of 1856. At the same time, Prefect Vaïsse's major construction projects were driving the working class away from the center. \"In a letter to the Prefect on October 27, 1858, Richard-Vitton proposed to offer [for a fee] \"a new outlet for the less well-off class, where they can settle at low cost in the best possible hygienic conditions \".\nThe press presents conditions that seem advantageous to buyers. The plots are at a distance from the grants. During an initial nine-year lease at 2 centimes per square meter, the acquisition is possible for 2 francs per square meter. This lease is to be renewed, if requested, for a further nine years at a rent of 15 centimes per square meter and the opportunity to become an owner for 3 francs per square meter.\nFollowing the plan he drew up, which was little altered by the municipal administration, Richard-Vitton ensured the creation of small plots with houses surrounded by a garden. This was to prevent the construction of any factories. Arthur Kleinclausz, quoted by Thierry Joliveau, writes \"[...] it was specified in many contracts that the land sold would not be used to build factories, but rather workers' houses and villas\".\nMoreover, since this was a real estate transaction, any transfer to the city was made in return for equivalent land.\nAfter Mrs Richard-Vitton's death on January 4, 1890, the ban on factories was maintained. Some deeds of transfer stipulate: \"The purchasers [...] may not install or allow to be installed any mechanical sawmill, factory, plant or large chimney\".\n\n\n==== Roads ====\nThe development and maintenance of the road network is carried out by offering the City the soil of the roads, 12km of streets, and four squares, 180,000 m2. As in all such cases, this is a matter of debate for the City Council: acceptance of this land is not a foregone conclusion. The opening of roads by private individuals or institutions is a frequent occurrence. In such cases, the owner is responsible for the costs.\nFor example, on June 27, 1872, the municipal council approved Richard-Vitton's proposal to sell 1.710 km of private road (24,700 m2) free of charge, \"subject to the express reservation that the City will have the option of completing these three roads only as and when the resources applicable to the byways allow\".\nSimilarly, on July 3, 1879, his widowed wife wrote that she would donate Rue Claudia to the town. But in 1906, given the cost of development, the councilors continued to refuse the donation. However, residents wanted this private road to become municipal. Acceptance only came in 1912 (thirty-three years later), when the road was \"classified as an ordinary suburban road \".\nThese passageways already existed, but were too narrow according to Louis-Gabriel Delerue, the engineer in charge of developing the Left Bank. He wanted a width of twelve meters to make Montchat a suburb similar to London. This view clashed with that of Richard-Vitton.\n\n\n==== Church ====\n\nRue de l'Église, to the north of the neighborhood, is a reminder that Montchatois had to go to the church of the Petites-Sœurs-des-Pauvres de La Villette to perform their devotions. \"In 1871, the Fabrique received nearly 10,000 m2 of land, valued at 60,000 francs, with a formal clause to build a church, an asylum, a presbytery, and schools. Two years later, the same Richard-Vitton offered an additional 60,000 francs generated by the construction of the first part of the church (95,000 francs). Another, unofficial letter \"literally demands an affable parish priest, from one of the downtown parishes, 'who will be able through his connections to obtain what he lacks' \". The construction of this church also added value to the surrounding land. On July 20, 1874, the building permit for the church was signed by Marshal Mac Mahon. The lot initially planned for the corner of cours Henri and rue Bonnand in 1858 was abandoned in favor of a 10,577 m2 plot of land located towards rue Besson-Basse and rue Charles-Richard, and sold for this purpose on October 23, 1874 by Mme Richard-Vitton, widowed on February 22, 1874104. After a provisional chapel on avenue du château in 1873 was opened for worship, Notre-Dame-du-Bon-Secours was opened on June 13, 1875. It was enlarged between 1891 and 1894, and consecrated on September 1 and 2, 1894. The surrounding 1,800 m2 green space was inaugurated on March 9, 2016.\n\n\n==== Schools ====\nAs part of \"a mass schooling movement\", new schools appeared. In 1872, a boys' school was opened at no. 101 cours Henri. In 1881, when the lease expired, part of the building at no. 19 Place Louise was rented. In 1890, the Montchat nursery school was opened, the construction of which had been decided on July 30, 1889. It was located on rue Louise. These schools were later replaced by the current ones.\n\n\n==== Transport ====\nDowntown Lyon was initially located far from Montchat. But it appears that \"the development of this sector is linked to the boom in public transport, which facilitates travel \"67.\n\n\n==== Tramways ====\n\nOn August 1, 1881, the Compagnie des omnibus et transports lyonnais (OTL) opened one of its first ten lines, No. 2 (Bellecour - Montchat). It is a normal track. This tramway has horse-drawn traction. It enters the district via the route de Genas, follows the Cours Richard-Vitton and ends at Place Ronde. On March 24, 1898, the line was electrified.\nOn July 5, 1889, the Compagnie lyonnaise de tramways (CLT) opened the Pins depot at the corner of chemin des Pins (now avenue Lacassagne) and chemin Feuillat. The depot includes a boiler. Each boiler - or locomotive - is filled with compressed steam. On January 11, 1890, locomotive no. 4 exploded, resulting in a number of fatalities. To protect passengers, service was temporarily suspended. The depot continued to operate with OTL, which stopped running streetcars there in 1956. In 2015, TCL still uses it as a bus depot.\nIn 1989, on its wall on avenue Lacassagne, the Cité de la Création painted a three-hundred-metre fresco comprising seven paintings. It traces the history of the tramway from its beginnings to the present day.\nOn February 29, 1896, the CTL opened the Pont-Lafayette-RG - Montchat line, which became OTL line no. 25. The tracks are metric. Trailer trains are hauled by Lamm and Francq steam locomotives. In the neighborhood, it runs along chemin des Pins (now avenue Lacassagne), Place Henri, cours Henri (now Docteur-Long) and ends at the corner of cours Richard-Vitton.\nIts depot, at the corner of rue Bara and chemin Feuillat, touches the western boundary of Montchat.\n\n\n==== Railways ====\nOn October 30, 1881, the Villeurbanne train station opened. It is located near Place Ronde. It was a station of the Chemin de fer de l'Est de Lyon (CFEL), linking the Gare de Lyon-Est with the Gare d'Aoste-Saint-Genix. Transport is mixed (goods and passengers), but in reality involves few passengers. The line closed for good in 2003.\n\n\n==== 20th century ====\nIn the 20th century, Montchat continued to develop. This was marked by a focus on transportation. This accessibility encouraged population growth, which in turn generated it. At the same time, housing grew. It was necessary to continue building schools. Places of worship multiplied. Community life was born.\nDuring the Second World War, the neighborhood suffered under the Occupation. The Resistance organizes and acts of violence are committed against it.\n\n\n== Policy and administration ==\nMontchat, like all neighborhoods, is not an administrative structure.\nSince 2002, it has had a district council called Montchat, whose boundaries extend over part of the Grange Blanche district. This refers to Lyon's 3rd arrondissement, which is headed by a mayor. This arrondissement is part of the commune of Lyon, whose local authority is the Metropole de Lyon.\nThe boundaries of the Lyon-XIIIN 36 canton, created in 2000, almost overlap with those of the Montchat district, which means that election results can be transposed as those of the district. For example, in the 2008 cantonal elections, Montchat gave 58.52% of its votes to Najat Vallaud-Belkacem (PS). In the 2012 legislative elections, the district gave Dominique Nachury (UMP) 53.3% of the vote, which contributed to her election. But in 2017 she was defeated by Anne Brugnera (LREM), who won with 60.55% of the votes cast in Lyon's 4th constituency, of which Montchat is a part.\nIn the 2020 municipal elections in Lyon, the results showed a triangular second round, with the following results: \"Ensemble, l'écologie pour Lyon\" list (merger of \"Maintenant Lyon pour tous les écologistes\" - EELV -, \"Vivons vraiment Lyon - La Gauche unie\" - PS-PP-ND-PCF-G. s - and \"Lyon en commun\" - LFI -) led by Grégory Doucet: 45.11%, the \"Lyon, la force du rassemblement\" list (merger of \"Bleu Blanc Lyon\" - LR-UDI - and \"Un temps d'avance\" - LREM-MoDem -) led by Béatrice de Montille: 33.55% and the \"Respirations\" list - dissident LREM - led by Georges Képénékian: 21.34%, with 61.18% abstaining. Grégory Doucet (EELV), who won 49.95% of the vote in Lyon's 3rd arrondissement, became mayor. Following the election, he became mayor of Lyon with 52.4% of the vote, thus changing his political color from centrist.\n\n\n== Population and society ==\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\nThe district's inhabitants are known as the Monchatois.\nInitially settled in the countryside, where \"urban development continued, but agriculture was still very much alive \", the population of Montchat proliferated. In 1856, for example, there were 654 inhabitants in 73 houses, and in 1896, forty years later, there were 3,573 inhabitants in 855 houses. In 1894, Montchat was designated a \"suburb of Lyon\". Today, the district is located in Lyon's third arrondissement. In 2013, the total municipal population of this arrondissement was 98,956.\nAccording to the \"îlots regroupés pour l'information statistique\" (IRIS) used by Insee, it is possible to analyze the population of the neighborhood. In 2013, the estimated total population was 14,320.\nToday, based on the above data, the neighborhood has 22 times more inhabitants than in 1856. This population is both largely settled and ageing. The proportion of people over 60 (18.94%), although lower than the national figure (23.6%), is still higher than in Lyon (18.54%). In proportions identical to the national and Lyon breakdowns, the male population of the district (46.87%) is lower than the female population (53.13%).\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nSince 1898, several public facilities have been built.\nIn 1898, on a fairly central site, the Montchat school complex (now the Collège Molière) was built by architect F. Comte at no. 31 avenue du Château. When it opened, it housed pupils from both the boys' and girls' schools, but they remained separate. A new building was added in 2005. On November 15, 2010, its canteen was inaugurated in a pre-existing annex on the other side of the avenue at no. 42. In 1912, the Montchat nursery school was built to replace the old nursery school, on the corner of rue Louise and cours Henri (now cours Docteur-Long). Subsequent construction work integrated this building with the Collège Moliére.\nIn 1913, to the north, the rue Louis school complex was inaugurated (now the Anatole-France school complex). In 2014, it includes a nursery school at 15, rue Louis and an elementary school at 26, rue Antoinette.\n\nIn 1913, to the north, the rue Louis school complex was inaugurated (now the Anatole-France school complex). In 2014, it included a nursery school at 15 rue Louis and an elementary school at 26 rue Antoinette.\nIn 1934, at the southwest corner, the Jules-Verne school was built at 13, rue Jules-Verne. In 2014, it includes a kindergarten and an elementary school.\nIn 1931, the decision was made to build the Charmilles school complex (now the Condorcet school complex) to the east. Architect Conchon designed the building from 1936 to 1937 at 6, rue Alfred-de-Musset. The two-story building is located on either side of the street. When it opened, the school had twenty-one classes, divided into a nursery school and an elementary school141. In 2013, the school admitted sixteen classes, all at the same level. Some of these classes are bilingual and use French sign language (LSF).\nIn the 1960s, the Louise Elementary School was opened at 16 rue Louise. It is located near the corner of the Collège Molière, thus forming an almost unbroken unit.\n\n\n=== Mail ===\nAnother public service was needed in the neighborhood. In 1896, a request was made to open an auxiliary post office. Later, a second one was opened143. On October 1, 1910 the Post and Telegraph Administration decided to open a fully-fledged office on Cours Henri - the mayor of Lyon still sometimes uses the term \"agglomeration\". In 2017, this post office, at 3 cours Eugénie, still bears witness to the district's dynamism.\n\n\n=== Cultural events and festivities ===\n\n\n==== Guignol ====\nIn 1924, the Guignol de Montchat troupe was created. For several years, Guignol and his companions performed at the Montchat patronage. The latter no longer performs these functions, but Guignol's performances are still held in the neighborhood, notably at festivals.\n\n\n==== Festivals ====\nIn 1958, to celebrate Montchat's centenary, Georges Bazin set up an association to organize the neighborhood's festivities during the three days of Ascension Day. These are run by volunteers and supported by local associations. On these occasions, aid is collected - initially in the form of coal, now in the form of money - to be redistributed to the elderly. The mythical cat and mascot of the festivities, Minet, is seated on his throne at all the annual parades.\nThe Montchat en fête association organizes other events, such as participation in Lyon's traditional Fête des Lumières, a garage sale, the Yggdrasil poetry festival to showcase the Parc Chambovet and many others.\n\n\n=== Neighborhood house ===\nIn 1909, architect A. Petit built the conference room at 31, avenue du Château. It later became part of the adjoining Collège Molière. Although the main entrance is walled in, its name still occupies the entire width of the façade. Then, on February 23, 1938, the Foyer Notre-Dame - which later became the Foyer - was inaugurated, designed by Pierre Labrosse, at no. 53 rue Charles-Richard. In 1958, to mark the centenary of Montchat, a commemorative plaque was placed on its west wall in tribute to Jean Louis François Richard-Vitton and his role in the urbanization of the district. In 2013, the renovated community center became the Espace Elsa-Triolet-Montchat. Under the aegis of the Lyon municipality, it houses Le Foyer Montchat (concert hall), La Maison des associations and La Maison des jeunes et de la culture de Montchat (MJC espace Montchat).\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nNumerous sports associations are based in the district. Among the facilities, at no. 3 rue Jules-Verne, the Marc-Vivien Foé municipal stadium - Jules Verne until November 12, 2003 - is the most extensive. It includes two cement basketball or volleyball courts, an athletics track and two soccer pitches for teams of eleven or nine players. However, due to their synthetic surface, they do not belong to the green spaces. The pitches are used by the AS de Montchat Lyon, which dates back to May 1968. The club's 900 members are the largest in the Rhône-Alpes soccer league.\n\n\n=== Cults ===\n\nBecause of the population growth, Roman Catholic worship could no longer be provided in the only church, Notre-Dame-du-bon-Secours, which dates back to 1875. So, in 1933, a 1901 association called Les Amis de Sainte-Jeanne d'Arc set up a temporary chapel (blessed on September 30, 1934) at 15, rue Jeanne-d'Arc. In April 1936, a church was built at 19 rue Jeanne-d'Arc (blessed on March 7, 1937), with a presbytery and a workhouse. The building, whose \"stained-glass windows come from the former chapel of the Jesuit college on rue de Séze\", is dominated by a 20-meter octagonal tower. On October 2, 1938, a mass for the sick was broadcast from this church for the first time. In 1997, it was enlarged.\nProtestant worship is also present. In 1931, the Reformed Church of Lyon built La Maisonnette at the end of the impasse Jules Massenet. This wooden temple burned down at the end of February 1956. In 1946, it built a temple at 18, rue Constant. In 2008, the premises proved no longer suitable and were vacated in favor of the brand-new Centre paroissial de la soie to the east of Lyon. The land was given over to an apartment building. In the 1960s, the Evangelical Free Church of Lyon founded a temple at 49, rue Louis.\nIn February 2002, the Beth Moche (La maison de Moïse) Israelite Cultural Association of Montchat was created to ensure Jewish worship, in a small space at no. 5 rue Saint-Isidore. Then on September 28, 2008, a synagogue was inaugurated at 22, cours du Docteur-Long.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nIn 2015, the median tax income per household was €29,500. By way of illustration, the median for Lyon is €23,040164 and the median for metropolitan France is €20,300 per year. For the city, these are residents with a comfortable income.\nThe neighborhood remains residential. Shops are located mainly along the two main thoroughfares, Cours Docteur-Long and Cours Richard-Vitton, as well as on Place du Château - which hosts the market - and Place Ronde.\n\n\n== Local culture and heritage ==\n\n\n=== Places and monuments ===\n\n\n==== Château de Montchat ====\nThe fortified house of Montchat - improperly named Château de Montchat - is recorded in archives dating back to 1534.\nAccording to the 1858 plan, it is reached \"via a tree-lined driveway originating at approximately the intersection of chemin des Pins (avenue Lacassagne) and rue des Feuillants (chemin Saint-Isidore)\". \"A beautiful chapel, located outside the buildings, was used for [...] religious services\".\nThis is a rectangular, two-storey building with a pitched roof. On the west facade, there are five windows per storey, the higher the storey, the lower the height. A wrought-iron balcony overlooks the triple door on the first floor. The south side features four openings per floor.\nThe southwest corner is flanked by a crenelated tower. This tower has a pepperpot to its north. A controversial restoration in the 19th century \"stripped the tower of its pepperpot and replaced it with crenellations [with machicolations] that are feudal in appearance only \".\nIn 1980, the interior housed twenty-seven rooms, with a twenty-two-meter gallery featuring four arched vaults.\nIn 1993, the layout of the rooms was redesigned, and the three central French windows on the west façade were covered by a veranda. The residence, which no longer offers accommodation, now hosts conferences and receptions in 3,000 m2 of greenery. The tower was restored again in 2014,170.\nThe building was successively owned by the Catherin family, the Lords of Bron, the Basset family, the Reverend Fathers of the Congrégation de Notre-Dame des Feuillants, and finally the Besson family, from which the Bonands, Vittons, and Richards descended, before being sold in April 1920 to the Bernard family, industrialists specialized in automotive parts. In 1993, Louis Martinod, grandson of the original Bernard purchasers, turned the house into a meeting place.\n\n\n==== Park Chambovet ====\n\nParc Chambovet is bordered to the northeast by rue Chambovet, from which it takes its name. Located on the heights of Montchat, it offers a view of the city, the Notre-Dame de Fourvière Basilica, and the Monts du Lyonnais. The five-hectare site includes a four-hectare municipal park and allotments. As part of Greater Lyon's urban ecology charter, according to a list updated in 1998, it is listed among the sites belonging to the Lyon metropolitan area's ecological heritage. As an urban and periurban park, it is one of seven intra-mural ecological sites.\nThe sixty-five allotment gardens of around 200 m2, in existence since 1926, were initially intended to supplement the resources of their beneficiaries and their families, to the exclusion of any commercial use. In the 2000s, \"the allotment gardens were seen as a place for vegetable production, but they also became places for leisure, education, meetings and exchanges\" under the aegis of the Espaces verts de Lyon.\nOriginally part of Lyon's countryside, the essential feature of this urban park is its rural aspect, combining meadows and woodland.\nIn 1940, this green space was the garden of a bourgeois house at 4, rue Chambovet. It belonged to the writer René Tavernier. This resistance fighter created the underground newspaper Confluences under the German occupation. As such, he welcomed many intellectuals to this multi-faceted place. From December 31, 1941, to July 1, 1943, Louis Aragon and Elsa Triolet stayed there under the names of Lucien and Elisabeth Andrieux. They formed a resistance movement in the southern zone, the Comité des écrivains. Director Bertrand Tavernier, René's son, recalls Aragon: \"This is where he wrote Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux, which he dedicated to my mother. The original is in our possession. After the war, he remade an original, because, according to my mother, the fact that he had dedicated the poem to her had provoked a domestic scene between him and Elsa Triolet... Is this a legend or the truth?\". At her request, a commemorative plaque recounting these events, unveiled by Michel Noir, Mayor of Lyon, was affixed in April 1993 to the address of the house then demolished by the Hospices civils de Lyon (HCL). On the other side of what is now the eastern entrance to Parc Chambovet, a plaque was affixed on March 9, 2019, also recalling the presence of Elsa Triolet.\nIn 1950, the commune acquired the land and planned to build a high school on it, but turned it into a municipal park. In 1960, the Hospices civils de Lyon bought the land to build a hospital, but abandoned the project, only to bring it up again in the early 1990s. The Parc Chambovet association, set up in January 1993, met with the town hall's approval, which in 1994 classified the site as a green zone that could not be built on. In 1998, the commune signed a lease with the HCL, which sold the park back to the commune in 2012.\nSince 1997, Les Courses pédestres has brought together around two hundred people, from youngsters to adults, on a Sunday morning in early spring. In addition, Un dimanche à la campagne is a family festival held on the third weekend in September. An afternoon of picnics and children's attractions. Over a thousand people are welcomed.\n\n\n==== Sculptures by Émile Peynot ====\nIn 1880, the municipality chose the sculptor Émile Peynot to create a representation of the Republic to mark the centenary of 1789. In collaboration with architect Victor-Auguste Blavette, he created a bronze depicting her perched on a fifteen-meter-high column. At the foot of this elevation are four stone statuary groups, representing Liberty, Equality, Fraternity and the City of Lyon. The latter, supported by the Rhône and Saône rivers, leads the Republic. The work was placed in Place Carnot, before being dismantled in January 1975 during the construction of metro line A. The first three large-scale representationsN 52 were placed in 1976 in the northeastern part of the three-hectare Parc de l'Est created in 1975- the park, located on a gravel pit filled in 1938, was renamed Parc Bazin in 1986 and extended in 2007. This is how the French motto Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité is represented. From north to east, La Liberté carries the Republican flame in protection, L'Égalité holds two men by the shoulders as they support the charter of human rights, and further back, La Fraternité watches over two men who help each other. As befits the style of public sculpture at the time, the men's muscles are prominent, their strength perceptible, the drapery heavy.\n\n\n==== Maison du docteur Long ====\nThe house at 18, cours du Docteur-Long is a place of remembrance.\nDoctor Jean Long was a doctor born in Alby-sur-Chéran on July 24, 1906, and a member of the Le Coq enchainé resistance network from 1941188. In this capacity, \"he distributed leaflets and newspapers, formed sabotage teams, carried out military intelligence by spying on factories manufacturing war material, and provided care to resistance fighters\". His London correspondent was André Philip. On October 23, 1943, at around 10:30 p.m., he was taken to Montluc, where he was tortured and executed in Feyzin, in the Quatre-Chemins area. His remains were found on the ground, bearing the marks of an execution. \"On his body was placed a sheet of paper bearing a handwritten inscription in block letters: \"Terror against terror. This man pays with his life for the murder of a National. Signature: \"Mouvement national anti-terroriste \". This was the first act of its kind perpetrated in Lyon by the Milice, and it caused a stir.\nA plaque was affixed on April 23, 1945, reading \"Here lived Dr. Jean Long, who on October 23, 1943 was the first victim of militia repression in Montchat. Français, souvenez-vous\". The important Montchat thoroughfare where his house was located, Cours Henri, was named Cours du Docteur-Long on October 23, 1945.\n\n\n==== RVI wasteland ====\n\nThe industrial wasteland left behind by Renault Véhicules Industriels - known as the Friche RVI - is an abandoned vehicle manufacturing site. The 74,262 m2 site, in the heart of Lyon, adjoins the southwestern corner of the Montchat district. Rectangular in shape, it faces Cours Albert-Thomas, 510 m rue Feuillat, 179 m avenue Lacassagne and 390 m rue Professeur-Rochaix.\nIn 1899, this was the site chosen by Édouard Rochet and Théodore Schneider for the first provincial car manufacturing plant - the Rochet-Schneider company. In 1909, the company set up a subsidiary here, which became the leading carburetor manufacturer of the first half of the 20th century, Société du carburateur Zénith. After a number of industrial activities, the site was taken over by Automobiles Marius Berliet in December 1959, which merged with Renault Véhicules Industriels in 1978. The latter turned the site into a spare parts store for heavy goods vehicles, before selling it in 2001. In 2002, it was bought by Greater Lyon.\nThe Belle Époque factory, designed by architect Louis Payet and completed in 1912, occupies the site. The long façade on Rue Feuillat and the sheds are a reminder of the building's destiny. This façade is marked by a majestic porch dating from the early 20th century, extended by an interior glass roof of the same date. In 2003, the building was awarded the \"Patrimoine du XXe siècle\" (20th-century heritage) label, and as such receives special attention from the architecte des bâtiments de France.\nGrand Lyon gave the site a new vocation. In 2005, it divided the site with the east-west Rue Félix-Rollet. The Société d'Enseignement Professionnel du Rhône (SEPR) campus moved in first in 2005, then expanded in 2013. Occupation by a self-managed artists' collective ended in 2010199. In November 2015, the FCMB (Fédération Compagnonnique des Métiers du Bâtiment) took up residence. Then, in April 2016, the Émile-Cohl school - which teaches drawing - and the Établissement d'enseignement supérieur en art mural (ÉCohlCité) took over. The Marguerite Yourcenar media library, part of the Lyon municipal library network, opened on October 10, 2017. Then the 8,000 m2 Zenith park was inaugurated on June 20, 2018, followed by the inauguration of a gymnasium, including one accessible to disabled athletes, on October 30, 2018.\n\n\n=== The cat ===\n\n\n==== Order of the Cat ====\nOn June 26, 1961, Georges Bazin registered the Ordre du Mérite Monchatois with the prefecture, initially to \"reward people who have helped the elders of the Montchat district\". Now known as the Order of the Cat, it recognizes those involved in the life of the district. He is the first Grand Chancellor and, as such, guardian of the cane on which every inductee must swear loyalty to Montchat. Inductees are not necessarily Montchat residents or natives. A wide range of personalities are among them. Some are nationally famous, such as Raymond Barre or Louis Pradel, others are of more confidential renown, such as Christiane Sibellin (Miss France 1965), or even of purely Lyonnais reputation, or simply benefactors. At the end of the annual Montchat festival, the four inductees take an oath based on the following criteria: \"Love of Montchat and Lyon. Total and constant devotion to our neighborhood. Worship of Montchat traditions (friendship, culture, humanism, gastronomy, mutual aid, sporting merit).\"\n\n\n==== The Cat's Misadventures ====\nIn a niche, at the corner of route de Genas and rue de l'Église, stands a stone statue of the Cat. At the same crossroads, on the opposite side of the street, also in a niche, the Virgin Mary is represented by a stone statue dated 1863 - a developer is required to replace it in its niche after the building has been remodeled. They both watch over the entrance to Montchat.\nThe assaults of time removed the feline's head in the 1950s. Montchat medallist Paul Penin210 then produced a stone figure. On March 5, 1998, thieves took advantage of scaffolding for repair work to unseal and carry off the emblem. Fortunately, two weeks later, the statue was found in a rubbish dump in relatively good condition. It was then replaced.\n\n\n=== Local personalities ===\nRené-Maurice Gattefossé (1881-1950), born in Montchat, a forerunner in aromatherapy whose establishment is currently based in Montchat.\nElsa Triolet (1896-1970) and Louis Aragon (1897-1982), poets and novelists, founded the Comité national des écrivains in Montchat during the Occupation.\nJean Reverzy (1914-1959), a Montchat-based doctor and writer, who won the Prix Renaudot in 1954 for his novel Le Passage.\nRené Tavernier (1915-1989), writer and journalist who moved to the Montchat district during the Occupation, and publisher of the free literary magazine Confluences.\nNajat Vallaud-Belkacem (1977), politician, general councillor for the Lyon-XIII canton (mainly Montchat) from 2008 to 2014.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLyon\nList of streets and squares in Lyon\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nJacquemont, Eugène.

The Shield), was a society of Arabic speaking Palestinian Jews in the Ottoman Empire created in 1913 to promote Zionism and counter anti-Zionism and Anti-semitism in the Arab press. It was founded by Nissim Malul, Shimon Moyal, Esther Moyal, and Avraham Elmalih, as well as others from Jaffa’s Sephardic community.\n\n\n== Views ==\nAvraham Elmaliah described the organisation's reason for being founded as ,\n\nespecially us [the society’s founders], who know the language of the country and who day in and day out read this poisonous press, who know the characteristics of the Arab people, with whom we live in close proximity to, are starting to feel [the situation] getting worse… realizing that we cannot sit silently while such great danger threatens the entire Yishuv.\nHaMagen proposed that Jews to take a more active role in politics to create a new generation of Jewish politicians to challenge the Palestinian Arabs in Ottoman politics, both in Istanbul and Jerusalem. The group also formed a legal team to challenge the Palestinian opposition in the courts and with help of the Ottoman Empire’s Chief Rabbi Haim Nahum, worked to suspend antisemitic Arab press. However they were challenged by the rise of articles in the Arab press that were rapidly changing from local patriotism to Arab nationalism.\nThe society combined Ottomanism with Zionism to portray the image of loyal Ottomans and attempted to create a greater understanding among Jews and Arabs, translating articles in the Arabic press so that new arrivals could be exposed to Arabs and their culture.\n\n\n== References ==",

Three bodies were subsequently washed ashore and the wreck was located in June 1980, but the cause of the sinking was never determined.\n\n\n== Sinking ==\nCaroline of Leigh was a newly built £35,000 Moody 36 yacht which was bought by Englishman Patrick Godfrey, who intended to take it Greece and use it for charter work in the Mediterranean. On her maiden voyage to Bordeaux, France, she called into Weymouth, Dorset, England. On board was Godfrey and three German nationals: professional skipper Wilfried Niemann, seaman Lothar Griep and nurse Ursula Buths.\nDespite an ongoing gale with force 10 winds, she departed Weymouth on 14 December 1979 and sank under mysterious circumstances off the coast of nearby Lulworth Cove, with the loss of all four on board. The yacht was equipped with the latest navigational aids and safety equipment, but no distress calls were made.The first indication of the sinking was the recovery of a storm jacket, containing personal documents belonging to Griep, from a Dorset beach on 18 December 1979. The bodies of Griep, Godfrey and Niemann, along with some lifejackets, were subsequently washed ashore and recovered. Griep's body was discovered at Chapman's Pool during the weekend of 29–30 December 1979.Owing to the undetermined circumstances surrounding the sinking, an open verdict was recorded at the inquest. The body of Buths was never recovered, although authorities reported that the discovery of a leg bone in a tracksuit, found wrapped around a lobster pot off Swanage by fishermen on 26 July 1982, possibly belonged to her.\n\n\n== Discovery of wreck ==\nIn early 1980, fishermen trawling off Lulworth Cove recovered some wreckage from the yacht, namely a small control panel. On 11 July 1980, a fisherman recovered the Thornycroft engine, still attached to part of the hull, in his trawl net off White Nothe, about half a mile away from the wreck's position.Between February and June 1980, Richard Farwell of the Dorset Sub-Aqua Club, and Dave Mountjoy, Neil Rowley and John Ray of Weymouth and Portland BSAC) worked together to locate the wreck. The team were granted the use of a small research and survey vessel, Sea Searcher, by local manufacturer Waverley Electronics, which was equipped with a side-scan sonar. The team recorded a number of anomalies on the seabed, but weather conditions prevented dives to begin investigating them until late May.A dive on 4 June 1980 resulted in the discovery of a toothbrush holder, which was quickly confirmed to be of the same type fitted to the yacht. The echo sounder search undertaken that day revealed two contacts and, after a period of delay due to unfavourable weather, the wreck was identified, surveyed, photographed and searched during a dive on 24 June 1980, approximately three miles off Lulworth Cove in 110 feet of water. The yacht was found to have suffered \"severe structural damage\".\nThe yacht was split into two sections, but remained joined by the steel rigging of the deck rails. Some of the centre cockpit, half of the saloon area, the keel and the hull section below the stern, were missing. The auxiliary motor instrumental panel, with ignition keys still in place, was recovered. Upon its discovery, the East Dorset coroner, Nigel Neville-Jones, suggested the wreck could be raised for examination, with a possible reopening of the inquest, but this was not carried out due to costs.The team of four divers, along with an additional three divers (Jon Ayling, Barbara Ayling and Graham Blake), returned to the wreck in July 1980 to conduct a search for the body of Buths at the request of the coroner. Lifting bags were used to raise both sections at an angle and they were then lowered back down onto the seabed. The body was not found.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe cause of the sinking was never established and it remained uncertain whether the yacht broke up in heavy weather or was involved in a collision with a larger vessel. There was no evidence of an explosion, the ship having run aground or the presence of paint from another vessel on the exterior of the wreck. A spokesman for A. H. Moody & Son Ltd., upon seeing photographs of the wreck, stated that it was not a \"natural boating accident\" but \"pretty obvious[ly] caused by an external force of some kind\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jamilton Andrés Ulloa Suárez was an Ecuadorian criminal and gang leader better known as El Topo who illegally controlled the mining, distribution, and marketing of gold from Bolivar State in Venezuela through his gang Banda El Topo. He is also known for perpetrating the massacre of twenty-eight miners in Tumeremo, Venezuela in 2016.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nEl Topo was born on August 16, 1972, in Santo Domingo, Ecuador as Jamilton Andrés Ulloa Suárez. He first entered Venezuela in 2002 through San Antonio del Táchira and registered as a foreign citizen with resident status in 2004. Prior to moving to Venezuela, El Topo lived in Colombia and received paramilitary training at a young age. He first worked a miner in Bolivar State, and over time rose through the ranks of illegal gold cartels. He became second-in-command of the illegal gold trade in Bolivar, and grew to manage thirty gold mines in Bolivar and Guyana after the death of his brother in 2009. El Topo was known for his brutal tactics of dismembering opponents and feeding the body parts to animals.\nOn March 4, 2016, residents of Tumeremo reported the disappearance of twenty-eight miners from the town. El Topo became the prime suspect for the disappearance, and the bodies of the miners were discovered in a mass grave with many having been shot in the head. The massacre was reportedly the result of a conflict between El Topo's gang Banda El Topo and another gang led by El Gordo. Following the massacre, El Topo became the most wanted criminal in Venezuela. SEBIN, the Venezuelan intelligence service, killed El Topo on May 6 at the El Limon mine in El Callao Municipality, Bolivar.\n\n\n== References ==",

He was born at Stratford, and was baptised there on 30 March 1589. His father is supposed to have been a grandson of John Rogers (1500?–1555). Nehemiah Rogers was his younger brother. From the title-page of Timothy's ‘Roman-Catharist,’ it appears that he was preacher at Steeple, Essex, in 1621, but he does not seem to have held the vicarage. In 1623 he became perpetual curate of Pontesbright or Chapel, Essex, and held this living till 1650. On 19 August 1636 he was appointed to the vicarage of All Saints', Sudbury, Suffolk. How long he held this preferment is not certain. In 1648 he was a member of the twelfth or Lexden classis in the presbyterian organisation for Essex, and in the same year he signed the ‘Testimony’ of Essex ministers as ‘pastor of Chappel.’ He probably died in 1650. His son Samuel was admitted vicar of Great Tey, Essex, on 27 January 1637–8, on the presentation of his uncle Nehemiah.\nRogers published: \n\n‘The Righteous Man's Evidence for Heaven,’ &c., 1619, 8vo (Watt); 8th edit. 1629, 24mo; 12th edit. 1637, 12mo; also Glasgow, 1784, 12mo; and in French, ‘L'Héritage du Ciel,’ Amsterdam, 1703, 8vo.\n‘The Roman Catharist,’ &c.

After Henry's defeat, Meginhard IV was shown mercy as a feudal lord. He did not get his possessions back, because he was without office at the time of his death. It has been established with certainty that the Elten castle came to his son Wichman and the Zutphen castle to his son Everhard. \nHowever, the count's title was permanently stripped from him. In most documents he is only referred to as nobleman and vassal and only in a papal bull of Pope Gregory V as \"count\". When he died between 952 and 956 he was without office. He was buried on the Elterberg. \nHe was succeeded by his son Wichman IV. \n\n\n== Childeren ==\nPossible child from a previous marriage to an unknown woman:\n\nGerberga of Hamaland (912-?)\nWith his wife Cunegonde:\n\nWichman IV (935-974)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMeginhard IV van Hamaland (888-955) » Stamboom Bas, Genealogie Online\nWelkom op het Familiearchief Krom - Gezin Overzicht, krommetje.nl\nPersoonskaart Meginhard IV van Hamaland, haroldborger.nl",

        "content": "Nehemiah Rogers (1593 – May 1660) was an English cleric.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nRogers was baptised at Stratford on 20 October 1593. He was the second son of Vincent Rogers, minister of Stratford-le-Bow, Middlesex, by his wife Dorcas Young, whose second husband he was. Timothy Rogers was his elder brother. Vincent Rogers was probably a grandson of John Rogers the martyr (Chester, John Rogers, &c. 1861, p. 252 seq.). Nehemiah was admitted to Merchant Taylors' School on 15 November 1602, and entered as a sizar at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, on 21 March 1612, and graduated M.A. in 1618. He also became a fellow of Jesus College. He was appointed assistant to Thomas Wood, the rector of St. Margaret's, Fish Street Hill, London, where he officiated until 13 May 1620. Through the influence of the widow of Sir Charles Chiborn, serjeant-at-law, he was then appointed to the vicarage of Messing, Essex (Christian Curtesie, dedication). On 25 May 1632 he was presented by Richard Hubert to the sinecure rectory of Great Tey, Essex, and he further received from the king the lapsed rectory of Gatton in Surrey, an advowson which he presented as a free gift in 1635 or early in 1636 to the president and fellows of St. John's, college, Oxford. The living was worth more than 100l. a year, and a letter from Archbishop Laud says it was given to the college out of friendship for him by ‘Mr. Nehemiah Rogers, now a minister in Essex, and a man of good note’ (Works, Oxford, 1860, vii. 242). On 1 May 1636 Rogers was presented by the king to a stall in Ely Cathedral. He exchanged the living of Great Tey with Thomas Wykes for that of St. Botolph's, Bishopsgate, in 1642. Upon Wykes's death Rogers presented his eldest son, Nehemiah, to the Tey rectory on 15 August 1644. The Messing living he appears to have resigned before May 1642.\nRogers was as uncompromising a royalist as a friend of Laud's was likely to be. About 1643 he was sequestered of both rectory and prebend. The vestry of St. Botolph's on 23 Feb. 1653 petitioned the Protector for liberty to the inhabitants to choose a minister in place of Rogers, but none appears to have been appointed. Rogers had many influential friends, and he obtained leave to continue preaching in Essex during the Commonwealth, mainly through the efforts of Edward Herries of Great Baddow, to whom one of his works is dedicated. For six years he was pastor to a congregation at St. Osyth, below Colchester, and next took up his abode for three years at Little Braxted, near Witham, where his friends Thomas Roberts and his wife Dorothy provided him with ‘light, lodging, and fyring.’ By them he was appointed in 1657 or early in 1658 to the living of Doddinghurst, near Brentwood. He died there suddenly in May 1660, and was buried there.\nRogers married Margaret, sister of William Collingwood, canon of St. Paul's after the Restoration, and had a daughter Mary, buried 1642, and at least three sons: Nehemiah (1621–1683), John Rogers (1627–1665?), and Zachary. The last graduated B.A. from Emmanuel College, Cambridge, 1648, was vicar of Tey 1661–1700, and of Chappel from 1674. A portrait of Nehemiah Rogers, engraved by Berningroth of Leipzig, with a German inscription, is mentioned by Colonel Chester. Rogers wrote ably on the parables, in a style learned and full of quaint conceits. His expositions have become exceedingly scarce. The titles of his publications run: \n\n‘Christian Curtesie, or St. Pavls Vltimum Vale,’ London, 1621, 4to.\n‘A Strange Vineyard in Palæstrina,’ London, 1623, 4to.\n‘The Trve Convert, containing three Parables: the Lost Sheepe, the Lost Groat [which Watt misreads for lost goat], and the Lost Sonne,’ London, 1632, 4to.\n‘The Wild Vine, or an Exposition on Isaiah's Parabolicall Song of the Beloved,’ London, 1632, 4to.\n‘A Visitation Sermon preached at Kelvedon, Sep. 3. 1631,’ London, 1632, 4to.\n‘The Penitent Citizen, or Mary Magdalen's Conversion,’ London, 1640.\n‘The Good Samaritan,’ London, 1640.\n‘The Fast Friend, or a Friend at Midnight,’ London, 1658, 4to.\n‘The Figgless Figgtree, or the Doome of a Barren and Unfruitful Profession layd open,’ London, 1659, 4to.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Smith, Charlotte Fell (1897). \"Rogers, Nehemiah\".

In October 2023, she was invited to be keynote speaker at a Cancer Research UK conference, discussing how systemic medical misogyny leads to an overlook of gynaecological cancers.\n\n\n== Recognition and honours ==\nUnlimited Emergy Artist Award, for beneFIT (won)\nRelish Theatre Award, for Puppy (won)\nVault Origin Award, for Batman (won)\nRoyal Society of Literature Award, for Cripligraphy (won)\nMichael Grandage Futures Bursary Award, for Untitled Welsh Drama (won)\nDerby Theatre In Good Company Mid-Career Commission Award, or Best Days of Our Lives (won)\nRaindance Film Festival, Ammo Live for Maturity (won)\nTheatre Uncut Political Playwriting Award, for Brennschluss (finalist)\nBread and Roses Award, for Puppy (runner up)\n\n\n== Work ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNaomi Westerman at IMDb",

        "content": "Willem Hubert Louis (Willy, Wil, Will) Ogrinc (Kerkrade, March 29, 1951 – Utrecht, March 21, 2018) was a Dutch poet and biographer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nOgrinc was the son of miner Leonard Hubert Ogrinc and Johanna Catharina Crombach. In the year he was born, his brother Heini (1946–1951) died in an accident. He studied medieval history and was a teacher of it at Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences. In 1976, he published an interview with Boudewijn Büch, whose poetry collection \"Quite Sad Songs for Little Gijs\" he had previously reviewed, a collection of poems about Büch's alleged love for young boys. Around 1978 he published Youthful Sinners in Constantinople by the journalist Esgo Taco Feenstra Kuiper(1857–1908), which, among other things, discussed the accessible ephebes in the place. He debuted as a poet in 1981 with Ger Kleis at his publishing house Sub Signo Libelli with \"Secretum secretorum\" which also had the love for boys as the subject. However, his 'life's work' seems to have been the biography of Jacques d'Adelswärd-Fersen (1880–1923), the first version of which he published in 1994 in the Amsterdam English-language magazine Paedika. The Journal of Paedophilia. Adelswärd is known for his literary work, his interest in boys around the age of 15, and the scandal he caused in Paris in 1903. Ogrinc was the one who first examined the preserved Paris court documents regarding Adelswärd in 2003. Since then, this biographical publication has always been mentioned in the literature about Adelswärd.\n\n\n=== Death ===\nWill Ogrinc died in 2018 at the age of 66.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n[About: Büch, Boudewijn.

        "content": "Mohamed Ag Intalla is a Malian Tuareg politician who has served as the amenukal of the Ifoghas Tuaregs since December 20, 2014.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nIntalla was born in 1950 as the eldest son of amenokal Intalla Ag Attaher. Intalla has two younger brothers; Attayoub and Alghabass. During his childhood, Intalla attended a French school and then a quranic school. He was sent on a peace delegation to Niger during the Tuareg rebellion of 2007 to 2009. When the Mali War broke out in 2012, Intalla did not join one of the Tuareg rebel movements. His father, however, supported the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) and his brother Alghabass joined Ansar Dine.On May 2, 2013, Intalla founded the High Council of Azawad (HCA), the predecessor to the High Council for the Unity of Azawad (HCUA). He called on members of the MNLA and Islamic Movement of Azawad (MIA), the latter being founded by Alghabass, to join the HCA to bolster peace in northern Mali. Intalla declared that the HCA was a \"peaceful movement not demanding independence from northern Mali and against terrorism.\"His father Attaher joined the HCA first, and Alghabass followed soon after and dissolved the MIA. On May 19, 2013, Attaher was appointed president of the HCUA and Intalla was appointed secretary-general. Intalla ran in the 2013 Malian parliamentary election under Rally for Mali, and was elected as deputy of Tin-Essako Cercle with 100% of the votes, although 86% of the population abstained from voting.Intalla was appointed amenokal of the Ifoghas Tuaregs on December 20, 2014, two days after his father Attaher's death in Kidal. Attaher's dying wish was for Intalla to be his successor. In 2015, Intalla told RFI that he was against the independence of Azawad, and in 2016, called for negotiations with jihadists to cut the jihadist groups off from foreign contacts.Intalla was re-elected as deputy of Tin-Essako in 2020, but this was cut short due to the 2020 Malian coup d'état. However, he was appointed to the National Transitional Council under the same role. Following the resurgence in conflict between the Coordination of Azawad Movements and Malian junta under Assimi Goïta in 2023, Intalla called for restraint and a return to the Algiers Accords of 2015. Intalla supported the merger of the HCUA, MNLA, and Arab Movement of Azawad into the CSP-PSD in February 2023. He resigned from the National Transitional Council in October 2023.\n\n\n== References ==",

The channel will also broadcast the Xfinity Series playoff races in 2024 as well as the regular season finale at Bristol Motor Speedway in a collaboration with NBC Sports in preparation for becoming the full season broadcaster of the series in 2025.\n\n\n== History ==\nOn July 28, 2023, NASCAR announced that The CW would gain the TV broadcast rights to the Xfinity Series starting in the next TV contract which would begin in 2025. Unlike the previous 2015 to 2024 TV contract where Fox and NBC shared the TV rights, The CW would broadcast the full season for the series, similar to the TV contract before that from 2007 to 2014 where ESPN aired every race of the series (which was the Busch Series in 2007 and the Nationwide Series from 2008 to 2014) on TV. The broadcast production will be run by NASCAR Productions in their new studio in Concord, North Carolina rather than The CW itself.On April 11, 2024, NASCAR announced that The CW would air the final eight races of the 2024 NASCAR Xfinity Series season in a collaboration with NBC. NBC would produce the races with Jeff Behnke, NBC Sports' Vice President of Motorsports, leading the production and have their commentators, play-by-play Rick Allen and color commentators Jeff Burton and Steve Letarte, broadcast the races.\n\n\n== Commentators ==\nPlay-by-play\n\nRick AllenColor commentators\n\nJeff Burton\nSteve LetarteThe CW has yet to announce who their pit reporters and studio analysts will be in 2024 and their entire lineup of broadcasters for the 2025 season and beyond.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Michael Ophovius or Van Ophovens (1570–1637) was the sixth bishop of 's-Hertogenbosch in the Low Countries.\n\n\n== Life ==\nOphovius was born in 's-Hertogenbosch, one of the four chief cities of the Duchy of Brabant in the Habsburg Netherlands. At the age of 15 he joined the Dominican Order in Antwerp. He taught eloquence at the order's house of studies in Leuven and later became a professor of theology at the University of Bologna. He returned to Leuven in 1601, and served as prior there, and then four terms as prior in Antwerp. From 1611 to 1615 he was provincial of Brabant, in that capacity taking part in the general chapter held in Paris in 1611. In 1623, while travelling in the Dutch Republic on family business, he transmitted a confidential message from the Brussels government to the Governor of Heusden, who had him arrested. He spent almost two years as a prisoner in The Hague.\nIn 1625 Ophovius was nominated bishop of 's-Hertogenbosch. He received episcopal consecration in Antwerp Cathedral on 17 September 1626, the principal consecrator being Jacobus Boonen, assisted by Johannes Malderus, bishop of Antwerp, and Antoon Triest, bishop of Ghent. Ophovius made his solemn entry into his see on 30 October. He not only governed his own diocese but was also involved in promoting the Holland Mission and Dominican missions to Denmark and Norway. On 18 April 1629 he met with the papal nuncio in Brussels to discuss developing missionary activity in Northern Europe, but in the same year, 's-Hertogenbosch was besieged and conquered by Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, and on 12 November 1629 Ophovius became an exile from his native city and episcopal see. He was initially given refuge in Nieuw-Herlaer Castle, and on 23 March 1630 moved to Geldrop Castle, where he resided until 1635 as the guest of Amandus II van Horne. In August 1630 and 1631 he took part in meetings of bishops from the Low Countries in Brussels.\nEarly in 1635, Ophovius moved his base to Postel Abbey, and late in 1636 he finally settled at the Dominican house in Lier, where he died on 4 November 1637. At the time of his death he was nearly destitute, not leaving enough money to pay his own funeral expenses. He was buried in the Dominican church in Antwerp, to the left of the high altar, and a magnificent tomb was erected, designed by Rubens, a close personal friend who had painted several portraits of him. His funeral sermon was preached by Hyacinthus Choquet\n\n\n== Publications ==\nD.

        "content": "Gracixalus jinggangensis, the Jinggang tree frog, is a species of frog in the family Rhacophoridae. It is endemic to China, where it has been observed on Mount Jinggan in Jiangxi Province.\nThe adult male frog measures about 27.9-33.8 mm in snout-vent length and a single female specimen was found to measure 31.6 mm. The skin of the frog's back, head, and the upper sides of the limbs has noticeable tubercles. The is a mark in the shape of the letter Y that goes from the intraorbital region to the middle of the back.\nThis frog lives in montaine bamboo forests between 1100 and 1340 meters above sea level. This frog has shown very little tolerance to habitat disturbance. The female frog lays eggs in water-containing holes in bamboo plants.\nScientists classify this frog as critically endangered because of its small range, which is subject to disturbance, such as the collection of bamboo for human use.  Scientists believe that some harvesting might not endanger this frog further if carefully managed. This frog's range includes at least one protected park: Taoyuandong National Nature Reserve.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "HMS Renard was a Beagle-class (from 1913 G-class) destroyer of the British Royal Navy. The Beagles were coal-fuelled ships, designed for a speed of 27 kn (31 mph; 50 km/h) and armed with a 4 in (102 mm) gun and two torpedo tubes. Built by  Cammell Laird and launched in 1909, Renard was initially commissioned into the First Destroyer Flotilla at Portsmouth. In 1912, the warship joined the Third Destroyer Flotilla before being transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet as part of the Fifth Destroyer Flotilla in 1913. As the First World War approached, the destroyer was based in Alexandra Egpyt, but was swiftly redeployed to Malta, followed, in 1915, by action in the Dardanelles Campaign. While serving with the Eastern Mediterranean Squadron and its successor the Aegean Squadron, as well as undetaking escort duties, the destroyer supported sorties by irregular troops against the Ottoman Empire. After the Armistice of 1918 that ended the war, Renard was initially transferred to the Nore and then sold in 1920 to be broken up.\n\n\n== Design and development ==\n\nRenard was one of the Beagle-class destroyers ordered as part of the 1908–1909 shipbuilding programme. The vessels were coal-burning after concerns had been raised about the availability of fuel oil in time of war and the bridge was larger and higher than previous designs. This reduced costs, although it also meant that five boilers were needed, the extra machinery meaning that deck space became more premium. The Beagle class vessels were not built to a standard design, with detailed design being left to the builders of individual ships in accordance with a loose specification, in this case Cammell Laird. In October 1913, as part of a wider renaming of the Royal Navy's warships into classes named alphabetically, the class was renamed as G-class.Renard was 266 ft 2 in (81.1 m) long, with a beam of 28 ft 2 in (8.6 m) and a draught of 16 ft 6 in (5 m). Normal displacement was 918 long tons (933 t), which increased to 983 long tons (999 t) by the end of the First World War. Five Yarrow boilers fed direct-drive Parsons steam turbines driving three shafts. Two funnels were fitted. The machinery was rated at 12,000 shaft horsepower (8,900 kW) giving a design speed of 27 kn (31 mph; 50 km/h). During sea trials, the destroyer reached a speed of 27.145 kn (31.238 mph; 50.273 km/h) at a displacement of 912 long tons (927 t). Up to 226 long tons (230 t) of coal was carried, giving a design range of 2,000 nautical miles (3,700 km; 2,300 mi) at 15 knots (28 km/h; 17 mph). The ship had a complement of 96 officers and ratings.Armament consisted of one 4 in (102 mm) BL Mk VIII gun forward and three 3 in (76 mm) QF 12-pounder 12 cwt guns aft. Torpedo armament consisted of two 21 in (533 mm) torpedo tubes, one placed forward and the other aft. Two spare torpedoes were carried. On 8 April 1916, the Admiralty approved fitting the destroyer with depth charges. Two depth charge launchers and two charges were carried.\n\n\n== Construction and career ==\nRenard was laid down at Cammell Laird's Birkenhead shipyard on 20 April 1909, was launched on 13 November and completed during September the following year. The ship was the sixth of the name to serve in the Royal Navy. The vessel was commissioned at Portsmouth and joined the First Destroyer Flotilla.   On 15 November 1911, Renard towed sister ship Scorpion to port after that vessel had been damaged in a collision with the Danish schooner Fyn when the First Flotilla was returning to Harwich after exercises in the English Channel. Scorpion was holed close to her engine room while Fyn sank.In 1912, a reorganisation of the Home Fleet resulted in the ships of the Beagle class forming the Third Destroyer Flotilla. Renard was recommissioned at Sheerness on 3 September and joined the flotilla at Chatham. The vessel remained part of the Third Flotilla in March 1913. Renard was transferred, along with the rest of the class, to the newly-formed Fifth Destroyer Flotilla as part of the Mediterranean Fleet.As the First World War approached, Renard was part of the First Division of the Fifth Flotilla and based in Alexandra. The destroyer sailed to Malta, joining the rest of the flotilla on 9 August. The island had a coal shortage, which restricted the vessel's activity. On 6 August 1914, the destroyer was deployed searching for the German warships Goeben and Breslau but this was curtailed by a lack of fuel. In 1915 Renard participated in the naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign with the Eastern Mediterranean Squadron. On 25 and 26 June, the destroyer was one of five, including sister ship Rattlesnake, that undertook minesweeping in the Dardanelles. Despite heavy fire, the ships achieved achieved their objective in what Rear Admiral John de Robeck, commander of the squadron, described as \"a most satisfactory manner\".Renard stayed with the Eastern Mediterranean Squadron into 1916. The year saw an intensification of submarine action by the Imperial German Navy in the Mediterranean Sea and an increasing demand on destroyers as escorts. In February alone, fifty ships, totalling 101,000 long tons (103,000 t), were lost. Due to a lack of resources, the destroyers in the Mediterranean Fleet could only escort high value ships, like troopships. However, the ship also saw other duties, including supporting raids on the Ottoman Empire. For example, on 24 July, the destroyer, as part of a small detachment that also included the monitor M33 and a minesweeper, escorted 172 irregular troops on a raid near the cities of Mytilene and Smyrna, the current İzmir. Despite being bombed by an aircraft of the Ottoman Aviation Squadrons, they returned with 3,200 sheep and other animals.The destroyer remained a member of the Fifth Destroyer Flotilla within the Mediterranean Fleet. As the following year opened, the need for destroyer escorts increased dramatically as the German navy introduced unrestricted submarine warfare. By June, the submarines were sinking 142,338 long tons (144,622 t) of shipping a month. In response, the Admiralty introduced convoys on major routes, including those between Malta and Egypt, although Renard was still called upon to escort occasional single high-value ships as well. For example, on 20 January the following year, Renard accompanied the Acheron-class destroyer Archer escorting a tanker. At this point, the destroyer was deployed as part of the Second Detached Squadron of the squadron, now renamed the Aegean Squadron, based at Pyrgos on the island of Imbros.After the Armistice that ended the war, the Royal Navy quickly withdrew all pre-war destroyers from active service. By February 1919, Renard had been transferred to The Nore. However, that deployment did not last long. As the force returned to a peacetime level of strength, both the number of ships and the amount of personnel needed to be reduced to save money. Declared superfluous to operational requirements, Renard was retired, and, on 31 August 1920, sold to Ward at New Holland to be broken up.\n\n\n== Pennant numbers ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBrown, David K.

        "content": "The materialism controversy (German: Materialismusstreit) was a debate in the mid-19th century regarding the implications for current worldviews of the natural sciences. In the 1840s, a new type of materialism was developed, influenced by the methodological advancements in biology and the decline of idealistic philosophy. This form of materialism aimed to explain humans in scientific terms. The controversy revolved around whether the findings of natural sciences were compatible with the concepts of an immaterial soul, a personal God and free will. Additionally, the debate focused on the epistemological requirements of a materialistic worldview.\nIn his \"Physiologische Briefe\" from 1846, the zoologist Carl Vogt explained that \"thoughts have roughly the same relationship to the brain as bile has to the liver or urine to the kidneys.\" In 1854, the physiologist Rudolf Wagner criticised Vogt's polemical commitment to materialism in a speech to the Göttingen Naturalists' Assembly. Wagner argued that Christian faith and natural history were two largely independent spheres. The natural sciences could therefore contribute nothing to the questions of the existence of God, the immaterial soul or free will.\n\nOne must not always let it go when this frivolous rabble wants to cheat the nation of the most precious goods inherited from our fathers and shamelessly blows the stinking breath from the fermenting contents of its bowels towards the people and wants to make them believe that it is a vain perfume (Free translation).\nWagner's attacks provoked equally sharp reactions from Vogt. The materialist point of view was also defended in the following years by the physiologist Jakob Moleschott and the doctor Ludwig Büchner, a brother of the well-known writer Georg Büchner. The materialists presented themselves as champions against philosophical, religious, and political reactionism. They set very different emphases but could count on broad support among the bourgeoisie. The promise of a scientific worldview became a defining element of the cultural conflicts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\n\n== Development of natural scientific materialism ==\n\n\n=== Emancipation of biology ===\n\nThe rise of popular materialism was encouraged by a critique of romantic-idealistic natural philosophy, which became widespread after 1830 and had an equal influence on natural science, philosophy, and politics.\nFrom the perspective of the history of science, the cell theory founded by Matthias Jacob Schleiden proved to be particularly influential. In his 1838 publication on phytogenesis, Schleiden declared the cell as the fundamental unit of all plants and identified the cell nucleus, which was discovered in 1831, as an essential factor in plant growth. The cellular theory of plant organism structure brought about a reorientation in botany. Before this, botany was primarily focused on macroscopic descriptions of forms. Schleiden's theory of plant structure was combined with a methodological critique of idealistic natural philosophy. The cell theory is based on empirically verifiable observations. This is because \"one only knows as many facts about the objects of the physical natural sciences as they have observed themselves\". The speculations of natural philosophers, on the other hand, were not based on strict observation. Therefore, all \"forging of systems and theories had to be thrown\" aside.\nSchleiden's programme for a methodically renewed botany was extended to other biological disciplines in subsequent years. In 1839, Theodor Schwann published his Mikroskopische Untersuchungen über die Uebereinstimmung in der Struktur und dem Wachsthum der Thiere und Pflanzen. Schwann explained that the cell theory revealed the general principle of life. All living organisms are composed entirely of cells, and the formation of organs can be explained by the growth and reproduction of cells. Rudolf Virchow proclaimed in this context that \"Life is essentially cellular activity\". The cell theory thus opened up the prospect of a scientific theory of life, on which materialists were able to build a few years later.\n\n\n=== Turning away from idealistic philosophy ===\n\nParallel to the methodological reorientation of the biological disciplines, a general criticism of the conservative legacy of German idealism developed in the intellectual climate of the Vormärz. In the natural sciences, criticism of natural philosophical methodology remained moderate, with many biologists remaining staunch anti-materialists. On the other hand, it was only a few years after Hegel died in 1831, when philosophical movements emerged that radically broke with German idealism in terms of ideology.\nThe critique of religion, as presented by Ludwig Feuerbach in The Essence of Christianity, was socially explosive and of particular importance. Feuerbach had attended every one of Hegel's lectures for over two years and wrote traditional idealist texts until the 1830s, having studied under Hegel in Berlin from 1824. However, Feuerbach and many other young students of Hegel began to have doubts. The young Hegelians were critical not only of the political conservatism of German idealism but also of the detached-from-empirical-observations philosophy of systems. In 1839, Feuerbach finally criticized his teacher's idealistic system in its principles. Although coherent and conclusive, it had distanced itself from sensory nature in an inadmissible way. Philosophy should be grounded in the sensual to arrive at a realization of nature and reality. \"Vanity is therefore all speculation that seeks to go beyond nature and man.\" Feuerbach and the new biological movements shared the idea of a view of nature emancipated from speculation. However, Feuerbach's goal was an anthropological theory of man, not one of the natural sciences.\nFeuerbach's explosive anthropology revealed itself most in his philosophy of religion. Idealist philosophy had erred in attempting to prove the truth of the theological doctrines through abstract arguments. In reality, he argued, religion was not a metaphysical truth, but an expression of human needs. The existence of God could not be proven by theologians and philosophers, as God was a human invention. Feuerbach's argument was not directed against religions in general. He acknowledged that there were certainly good reasons for religious belief. But he believed that these reasons were of a psychological nature, as religions satisfied real human needs. In contrast, philosophical-theological proofs of the existence of God were seen as speculative fantasies. Feuerbach's critique of religion was received as a radical attack on the cultural establishment, and by the mid-1840s, he had become the centre of philosophical renewal movements.\n\n\n== Carl Vogt and the political opposition ==\n\nThe materialism controversy was sparked by the materialist theses published by physiologist Carl Vogt from 1847 onwards. Vogt's turn towards materialism was influenced by the scientific and cultural renewal movements, as well as his political development. Vogt was born in Giessen in 1817 and grew up in a family that combined scientific and social revolutionary tendencies. Philipp Friedrich Wilhelm Vogt, Carl's father, was a medical professor in Giessen until he accepted a professorship in Bern in 1834 due to the threat of political persecution. The political entanglements were in the tradition of the family on his mother's side. Louise Follen's three brothers were all forced into emigration due to their nationalist and democratic activities.\nIn 1817 Adolf Follen drafted an outline for a future imperial constitution. Two years later, he was arrested for \"German activities\". His subsequent exile in Switzerland spared him from a 10-year prison sentence. Karl Follen defended tyrannicide in a pamphlet and was therefore considered the intellectual author of the assassination attempt on the writer August von Kotzebue. He managed to escape to the United States, where he established himself as a professor of German at Harvard University from 1825. In 1833 Paul Follen, the youngest of the Follen brothers, co-founded the Gießener Auswanderungsgesellschaft with Friedrich Münch. Although the society's goal of establishing a German republic in the United States was unsuccessful, Paul Follen eventually settled in Missouri and became a farmer.\nCarl Vogt started studying medicine at Giessen in 1833, but switched to chemistry under the guidance of Justus Liebig. Liebig's experimental methods were in direct contrast to the idealistic philosophy of nature. As a co-founder of organic chemistry, Liebig rejected the separation between living processes and dead matter, providing Vogt with an intellectual foundation for the materialism that he later developed. However, in 1835, Vogt was unable to continue his studies in Giessen due to political circumstances. He had assisted a politically persecuted student to escape, which made him a target of the police. As a result, Vogt emigrated to Switzerland and completed his studies at the Faculty of Medicine in 1839.\nDuring the early 1840s Vogt became involved with the political opposition and new scientific movements. However, he had not yet developed his ideological materialism at this point. It was during his three-year stay in Paris that Vogt's political and ideological radicalisation occurred. His acquaintance with anarchists Mikhail Bakunin and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon had a lasting influence on Vogt's political thinking. Starting in 1845, he began publishing his Physiologische Briefe, which presented physiology clearly and understandably based on Liebig's Chemische Briefe.\nThe initial letters did not reference Vogt's materialism. Only in the letter on nerve power and mental activity, published in 1846, did Vogt state \"that the seat of consciousness, will and thought must ultimately be sought solely in the brain\".\n\nInitially, however, political practice took precedence over materialist theory. Vogt had just been appointed professor of zoology in Giessen, through the influence of Liebig and Alexander von Humboldt, when the German Revolution began in March 1848 and democratic forces rose up against the so-called reaction in various parts of Germany. When the March Revolution reached the small university town of Giessen, Vogt was appointed commander of the militia and eventually represented the 6th electoral district of Hesse-Darmstadt in the Frankfurt Parliament from 1848 to 1849. After the Prussian King Frederick William IV rejected the imperial dignity offered to him and political defeats led to the dissolution of the National Assembly, Vogt moved to Stuttgart with the remaining 158 deputies to form the so-called rump parliament, which was forcibly dissolved after only a few weeks in early June 1849.\nAppointed as one of the \"five imperial regents\" by the remaining parliament, Vogt found himself at the centre of the political opposition. On 18 June of that year, Württemberg troops occupied the conference venue. Vogt emigrated to Switzerland and took refuge in his parents' house. Having failed in his political ambitions and deprived of his academic career, he once again focused on biological studies, which he now interpreted in a radically ideological way.\n\n\n== Progression of the debate ==\n\n\n=== Materialism controversy until 1854 ===\nIn 1850, Vogt travelled to Nice to pursue zoological studies due to a lack of clear academic prospects. The following year, he published a book on animal states that combined zoology with a critical evaluation of the German state of affairs. The book contained a political plea in favour of anarchism, arguing that \"every form of government, every law [is] a sign of the lack of completion of our state of nature\". Vogt's biologistic argument in favour of anarchism was based on the idea that humans are natural and completely material organisms, in continuity with animal states. According to Vogt, biology implied both materialism and the subversion of the prevailing order. In his book, he referred unequivocally to the German situation:\n\nSo go forth, little book, as an old truth in a new guise. Pilgrim around in that wretched land whose language you speak, but whose mind will hardly meet you. (Free translation)\nVogt succeeded in generating interest among the German public with his popular and polemical attacks. In 1852, he published Bilder aus dem Thierleben, which not only provided a detailed description of materialism but also strongly criticised German university scholars. It is argued that every biologist who thinks clearly must acknowledge the truth of materialism, as the dependence of soul functions on brain functions is evident. This dependence is most clearly shown in animal experiments, so \"we can cut off the mental functions of the pigeon piece by piece by removing the brain piece by piece\". But if the soul's functions depended on the brain in this way, the soul could not survive the death of the body. And if the brain functions are determined by the laws of nature, then the same must also apply to the soul.\n\nThus the door would be opened to simple materialism – man, as well as the animal, would be only a machine, his thinking the result of a certain organisation – free will therefore abolished? [...] Truly, that is so. It really is so. (Free translation)\nAccording to Vogt, those who disagreed with these statements had not understood the necessary consequences of physiological research. This criticism was directed towards Rudolf Wagner, an anatomist and physiologist from Göttingen, who in 1851, had criticised Vogt in the Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung for replacing God with a \"blind, unconscious necessity\". Wagner had also suggested that the soul of a child is composed of equal parts of the mother's and father's souls. Vogt found this idea to be a useful model. The concept of a composite child's soul not only contradicts the theological belief in the indivisibility of the soul, but is also physiologically nonsensical. Physical characteristics, such as facial features, are naturally inherited from parents to their children, and the same applies to the brain. This is why the inheritance of character traits can be easily explained in materialistic terms.\n\n\n=== Göttingen Naturalists' Meeting ===\n\nDuring the summer of 1854, the 31st Naturalists' Meeting was held in Göttingen. The meeting was dominated by the debate over the existence of a God-created soul. Wagner used this platform to deliver a lecture on human creation and the substance of the soul. In his lecture, he accused the materialists of undermining the moral foundations of social order by denying free will.\n\nWe who are gathered here, however different our world view may have been in each of us, we who have seen and felt the struggle of our nation in its last battles, and to a large extent have participated in it ourselves, we must also ask ourselves what the results of our research will be for the education and future of our great people. (Free translation)\nVogt's materialism contradicted the moral responsibility of the researcher, as it reduced people to blind and irresponsible machines. In the same year, Wagner published a second paper in which he added to his moral criticisms with a general argument on the relationship between knowledge and faith. According to Wagner, these are two largely independent areas, meaning that no scientific knowledge can prove or disprove religious faith.\nPhysiologists describe the internal structure and function of physical organs. Materialists interpret these descriptions by identifying physical and mental functions. Dualists assume that bodily functions act on an immaterial soul. The natural sciences cannot decide the question of the soul, because neither interpretation could be derived from a physiological description. \"There is not a single point in the biblical]doctrine of the soul [...] that would contradict any doctrine of modern physiology and natural science.\"\n\n\n=== Charcoal burning faith and science ===\nWagner's pamphlets brought the materialism debate to the centre of public interest. In response, Vogt wrote the polemic Köhlerglaube und Wissenschaft against Hofrath Rudolf Wagner in Göttingen. The first half of the text consists of ad hominem attacks against Wagner.  It was alleged that he was not a serious and productive scientist, but merely adorned himself as the editor of countless works with the research work of others, and that he had also tried to suppress his materialistic critics with the help of state power. Wagner asserted that the materialist denial of free will was socially irresponsible in view of the political events of 1848 (March Revolution), in response to Vogt's anger.\n\nWretched wretch! Where did you take part, sympathise, participate on one side or the other? [...] We have not seen you, neither in the ranks of our enemies, nor in those of our friends, and we can call out to you with the poet: 'Fie on you boy behind the stove. (Free translation)\nIn the second part of the work, Vogt systematically argued against Wagner's thesis of the compatibility of \"naive Köhler faith\" and scientific knowledge. Vogt stated that anyone who places the soul in a realm beyond empirical verifiability cannot be directly refuted by physiology. However, this assumption is ultimately useless and even incomprehensible. The relationship between soul and brain functions supports the idea of an identity between the body and soul, rather than confirming the axiom of the immaterial soul. This view is shared by Wagner, who acknowledges that all organs, except for the brain, are subject to biological processes. Wagner also does not propose the existence of a \"muscle soul\" that initiates muscle contraction. He does not argue that there is a kidney soul responsible for the excretion of metabolic products, in addition to the biological processes in the kidneys. \"It is only in the case of the brain that this is not recognised; it is only in the case of the brain that a special, illogical conclusion that is not valid for the other organs is accepted\".\n\n\n=== Food, strength and substance ===\nBy 1855 the commitment to materialism had become an influential movement, despite Vogt's polemical theses facing resistance in academic and political circles. Vogt was supported by two younger scientists, Jakob Moleschott and Ludwig Büchner, who also published their materialist ideas in popular science publications. These three authors were portrayed as champions of materialism, which appeared to be conclusive. The debate surrounding materialism catalyzed intensifying popularisation efforts and ideological debates, not themselves without controversy, about the relationship between natural science and society. This led to discussions about the Darwinian theory of evolution from the late 1850s onwards.\n\nJakob Moleschott was born in 's-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands, in 1822. He came into contact with Hegel's philosophy at an early age but eventually studied medicine in Heidelberg. Becoming strongly influenced by Feuerbach's philosophy, he focused on questions of metabolism and dietetics. Moleschott believed that food was the fundamental building block of both physical and mental functions, in line with his materialistic convictions. In his book 'Die Lehre der Nahrungsmittel: Für das Volk', Moleschott aimed to popularise his studies and presented detailed dietary plans for the impoverished sections of the population. The materialistic approach should not only deny the existence of an immaterial soul and God but also positively lead people to a better life.\nIn 1850 Moleschott sent a copy of his work to Feuerbach, who published an influential review titled Die Naturwissenschaft und die Revolution in the same year. In the 1840s, Feuerbach had defined his philosophy beyond idealism and materialism; now he explicitly supported the materialists. The philosophers continued to argue fruitlessly about the relationship between body and soul, while the natural sciences had already found the answer.\n\nFood becomes blood, blood becomes heart and brain, thoughts and mind. Human food is the basis of human education and attitude. If you want to improve the people, give them better food instead of declamations against sin. Man is what he eats. (Free translation)\nBüchner's relationship with the public was even more influential than Moleschott's alliance with Feuerbach. Born in Darmstadt in 1824, Büchner had already met Vogt as a student. In 1848, he became a member of the citizens' militia led by Vogt. After a few unhappy years as an assistant at the medical faculty in Tübingen, Büchner decided to publish a concise summary of the materialist worldview. Kraft und Stoff was a bestseller, with 12 editions published in the first 17 years, and translated into 16 languages. Unlike Vogt and Moleschott, Büchner presented materialism in a summary of findings that could be understood without prior philosophical or scientific knowledge, rather than in the context of his research. The starting point was the unity of force and substance, which Moleschott had already emphasised. Inherent forces are necessary for the existence of substance, just as substance is necessary as a carrier for forces. This unity directly implies the impossibility of immaterial souls, as they would have to exist without a material carrier.\n\n\n== Reactions in the 19th century ==\n\n\n=== Philosophy of neo-Kantianism ===\nMaterialism was supported by natural scientists such as Vogt, Moleschott, and Büchner, who presented their theories as the consequences of empirical research. Following the collapse of German idealism, university philosophy appeared discredited as baseless speculation. Even the philosopher Feuerbach entrusted the natural sciences with resolving the philosophical question of the relationship between soul and body.\nAn influential philosophical critique of materialism did not develop until the 1860s with the emergence of Neo-Kantianism. In 1865, Otto Liebmann strongly criticised philosophical approaches from German idealism to Schopenhauer in his work Kant und die Epigonen, concluding each chapter with the statement \"So we must go back to Kant!\". Friedrich Albert Lange published his Geschichte des Materialismus the following year, in agreement with this position. Lange accused the materialists of \"philosophical dilettantism\", which, according to Kantian philosophy, ignored essential insights.\nThe Critique of Pure Reason's central theme was the question of the conditions of all possible knowledge, including scientific knowledge. Kant argued that human cognition does not depict the world as it really is. All knowledge is already characterized by categories such as \"cause and effect\" or \"unity and multiplicity\". These categories are not properties of the things themselves but are brought to the things by humans. Similarly, space and time lack absolute reality and are instead forms of human perception. As all knowledge is already characterised by categories and forms of perception, it is impossible for humans to recognise things in themselves. Therefore, it is not possible to scientifically prove or refute the existence of an immaterial soul, a personal God, or free will.\nLange argues that materialists made a fundamental error by disregarding Kant. Materialism posited that only matter exists, but failed to acknowledge that even scientific descriptions of matter do not describe absolute reality. Such descriptions already assume the categories and forms of perception, and therefore cannot be considered descriptions of things in themselves. Lange's argument is supported by the natural scientist Hermann von Helmholtz, who presented his work on sensory physiology in the 1850s as an empirical confirmation of Kant's work. In his 1855 lecture Ueber das Sehen des Menschen (On Human Vision), Helmholtz first described the physiological foundations of visual perception and then explained that vision is not a true-to-life representation of the outside world. Following Kant's philosophy, it is argued that human interpretation characterises every perception of the outside world, making it impossible to access things in themselves.\n\nBut as it is with the eye, so it is with the other senses; we never perceive the objects of the outside world directly, but we only perceive the effects of these objects on our nervous system. (Free translation)\n\n\n=== Ignoramus et ignorabimus ===\n\nThe scientific materialists did not engage with the arguments of the Neo-Kantians, as they saw the reference to Kant as just another speculative attack on the results of the natural sciences. However, the criticism of physiologist Emil Heinrich Du Bois-Reymond in his 1872 lecture Ueber die Grenzen des Naturerkennens, which declared consciousness to be a fundamental limit of the natural sciences, appeared more concerning. His phrase \"Ignoramus et ignorabimus\" (Latin for \"We do not know and we will never know\") sparked a long-lasting controversy regarding the concept of a scientific worldview. This controversy, known as the Ignorabimus controversy, was debated with similar fervour to the Vogt and Wagner debate 20 years prior, and even more so in the political arena. However, this time the materialists were on the defensive.\nDu Bois-Reymond argued that the materialists' main problem was their inadequate argument in favour of the unity of brain and soul. Vogt, Moleschott, and Büchner only emphasized the dependence of soul functions on brain functions. Tests on animals had already demonstrated that damage to the brain leads to an impairment of mental functions. The concept of an immaterial soul is therefore rendered implausible by this dependency, making materialism the only acceptable conclusion. However, this consequence simply ignores the question of how the brain generates consciousness in the first place, how Büchner put it himself:\n\nIncidentally, for the purpose of this investigation, it may seem quite indifferent whether and in what way it is possible to imagine how phenomena of the spirit arise from material connections or activities of the brain substance, or how material movement is transformed into a movement of the spirit. It is sufficient to know that material movements act on the spirit through the mediation of the sense organs. (Free translation)Du Bois-Reymond argued that proving dependency relationships was not enough to support materialism. To reduce consciousness to the brain, one must also explain it through brain functions. But the materialists were unable to provide such an explanation: \"What conceivable connection is there between certain movements of certain atoms in my brain on the one hand, and on the other hand the original, undefinable, undeniable facts 'I feel pain, feel desire; I taste sweetness, smell the scent of roses, hear the sound of an organ, see red'.\" Du Bois-Reymond argued that there is no conceivable connection between the objectively described facts of the physical world and the subjectively determined facts of conscious experience. Therefore, consciousness represented a fundamental barrier to perceiving nature.\nDu Bois-Reymond's Ignorabimus speech highlighted a fundamental weakness of scientific materialism. Although Vogt, Moleschott, and Büchner claimed that consciousness was material, they also acknowledged that brain functions could not explain it. This problem contributed to the development of a scientific worldview that shifted from materialism to monism in the late 19th century. Ernst Haeckel, the most famous proponent of a \"monistic worldview\", shared the materialists' rejection of dualism, idealism, and the concept of an immortal soul.\n\nMonism, on the other hand [...] recognises only one single substance in the universe, which is God and nature at the same time; body and spirit (or matter and energy) are inseparable for them. (Free translation)However, Haeckel's monism differs from materialism in that it does not recognise the primacy of matter. According to it, body and spirit are inseparable and equally fundamental aspects of a substance. This monism appears to circumvent du Bois-Reymond's problem. If matter and spirit are equally fundamental aspects of a substance, then spirit no longer needs to be explained by matter.\nBüchner also viewed monism as the appropriate response to philosophical criticism of materialism. In a letter to Haeckel dated 1875, he wrote:\n\nI [...] have therefore never used the term 'materialism', which evokes a completely one-sided idea, for my school of thought and only accepted it here and there later out of necessity because the general public knew no other word for the whole movement [...]. The term 'monism' that you suggest is very good in itself, but it is very doubtful whether it will be accepted by the general public. (Free translation)\n\n\n=== Political and ideological impact ===\nAlthough the materialists gained popularity among the general public, they were not successful politically. Vogt, Moleschott, and Büchner lost their careers at German universities due to their advocacy of materialism. The revolutionary nature of Vogt's materialism could not succeed during the reactionary era after 1848. During the political movements of the latter half of the 19th century, scientific materialism failed to exert significant influence, partly due to differences with Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Marx labelled Vogt as a \"small-university beer bouncer and misguided Barrot of the Reich\", and the conflicts escalated into personal denunciations. For instance, Marx's circle also accused Vogt of having worked as a French spy.\nThe altered political situation is also apparent in the work of Ernst Haeckel, who embraced the concept of a scientific worldview from the materialists but gave it a fresh political orientation. Haeckel, who was 17 years younger than Vogt, established himself as a proponent of Darwinism in Germany during the 1860s. In his polemical rejection of \"church-wisdom and [...] after-philosophy\", Haeckel closely resembled the scientific materialists. Vogt viewed physiology as the starting point for a scientific worldview, while Haeckel made a similar claim in referring to  Charles Darwin:\n\nIn this spiritual battle, which now moves the whole of thinking humanity and which prepares a humane existence in the future, on the one side under the bright banner of science stand: freedom of thought and truth, reason and culture, development and progress; on the other side under the black banner of hierarchy: spiritual bondage and lies, irrationality and crudeness, superstition and regression. (Free translation)However, for Haeckel, the concept of \"progress\" was primarily anti-clerical, opposing the church rather than the state. Bismarck's Kulturkampf, which began in 1871, provided Haeckel with an opportunity to connect anti-clerical monism with Prussian politics. As the First World War approached, Haeckel's statements became increasingly nationalistic, with racial theories and eugenics providing a seemingly scientific basis for chauvinistic politics. Therefore, Vogt's vision of a politically revolutionary natural science ultimately proved itself short-lived.\n\n\n== Reception in the 20th century ==\nIn the 19th century, scientific materialism played a significant role in ideological debates. The discussions around Darwin's theory of evolution and Haeckel's monism gained prominence in the 1860s. Nonetheless, the question of a scientific worldview remained controversial, and Büchner's Kraft und Stoff remained a bestseller.\nThe First World War and Haeckel's death in 1919 were significant turning points. In the Weimar Republic, the debates of the 1850s were no longer relevant, and the philosophical currents of the interwar period consistently criticised materialism, despite differences in content. This also applied to logical positivism, which adhered to the idea of a scientific worldview but interpreted it in an anti-metaphysical way. The logical positivists' criterion of meaning said that a proposition was only comprehensible if it could be verified empirically. This meant that materialism, monism, idealism, and dualism failed to meet this criterion and were considered misguided fantasies of a speculative era of philosophy. Materialist theories of consciousness were not revisited until the 1950s, when they were taken up from Anglo-Saxon philosophy. By this point, however, the scientific materialists of the 19th century had been forgotten. None of these new texts refer to Vogt, Moleschott or Büchner. Instead, the materialists of the post-war period focused on contemporary neuroscience.\nScientific materialism was largely ignored in the history of science and philosophy until the 1970s. Its reception in the GDR began relatively early under the influence of Dieter Wittich, who received his doctorate in 1960 with a thesis on the scientific materialists. In 1971, he published a collection of texts entitled Vogt, Moleschott, Büchner: Schriften zum kleinbürgerlichen Materialismus in Deutschland with Akademie Verlag. In his detailed introduction, Wittich, who held the only chair for epistemology in the GDR, honoured the political, scientific, and religious-critical work of the materialists. However, he also pointed out their philosophical shortcomings. He stated that the \"petty-bourgeois materialists\" were \"vulgar materialists because they insisted on metaphysical materialism at a time when dialectical materialism had become not only a possibility but also a reality\".\nIn 1977 Frederick Gregory, an American historian of science, published his monograph Scientific Materialism in Nineteenth Century Germany, which is still considered a standard work today. Gregory argues that the significance of Vogt, Moleschott and Büchner lies not in their specific elaboration of materialism, but rather in the social impact of their scientifically motivated criticism of religion, philosophy and politics. \"The overwhelming trademark of the scientific materialists, as far as the historian is concerned, is not their materialism, but their atheism, more properly their humanistic religion.\"\nIn line with Gregory's judgement, the significance of the materialists in the secularisation process of the 19th century is generally acknowledged in the current research literature, while their philosophical positions are still subject to fierce criticism in some cases. Renate Wahsner, for example, explains: \"It is not possible to contradict the view held in the literature, which denies all three of them sharpness and depth of thought\". Not all authors share this negative assessment, with Kurt Bayertz, for example, defending the relevance of the scientific materialists, as they had developed \"the first fully developed form of modern materialism\". \"Although the form of materialism developed by Vogt, Moleschott and Büchner is only one form of materialism, it is the form that is typical of modernity and the most influential and effective form today.\" An examination of current materialism controversies must therefore begin in the 19th century.\n\n\n== Literature ==\n\n\n=== Primary literature ===\nDu Bois-Reymond, Emil (1974). \"Über die Grenzen des Naturerkennens (1872)\".

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Comic book grading is the process of evaluating the condition of a comic book and assigning it a grade that reflects its overall quality and preservation. This grading system, often done by third-party professional grading companies (although often carried out informally by Comic Book Shops and experienced collectors), provides a standardized way to assess the condition of a comic book, taking into account factors such as wear, creases, discoloration, and other imperfections. Many scales and standards can be used, although the most accepted assign a condition ranging from 0–10.0, or Poor to Near Mint+.\nCollectors and enthusiasts often choose to have their comic books graded to establish an official and consistent assessment of their condition. Graded comic books are sealed in protective cases with a label displaying their grade, ensuring their preservation and authenticity. This practice has become increasingly popular in the comic book community, as it helps determine the value of a comic book and provides assurance to buyers and sellers in the marketplace.\n\n\n== History ==\nComic book grading, the assessment and assigning of a numerical grade to a comic book's condition, has evolved alongside the comic book industry itself. The concept of grading comics emerged in the late 20th century as collectors and enthusiasts sought a standardized method to evaluate the condition and value of comic books.\nThe practice of grading comic books can be traced back to the emergence of organized comic book collecting communities in the 1960s and 1970s. Initially, collectors relied on subjective assessments of a comic book's condition, often based on personal opinions and visual inspection alone. However, as the hobby grew in popularity and value, there arose a need for a more objective and standardized approach to grading.\nOne significant milestone in the history of comic book grading occurred in 1970 with the founding of the Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide by Robert M. Overstreet. While primarily serving as a pricing reference for collectors, the guide also included guidelines for assessing a comic book's condition, laying the groundwork for future grading standards.\nThe 1980s witnessed further developments in comic book grading with the establishment of professional grading services. Companies such as Comics Guaranty LLC (CGC) and later, Certified Collectibles Group (CCG), introduced third-party grading services that employed trained experts to evaluate and grade comic books according to standardized criteria. This marked a significant shift towards objectivity and professionalism in the grading process.\nOver time, the standards and criteria used for comic book grading have evolved, reflecting changes in the industry and the growing sophistication of collectors. Today, grading standards typically consider factors such as cover gloss, page quality, spine integrity, and any defects or imperfections present in the comic.\nThe adoption of numerical grading scales, such as the 10-point scale employed by CGC (with 10.0 being \"Gem Mint\" and 0.5 being \"Poor\"), has further standardized the grading process and facilitated commerce within the collector's market. Additionally, advancements in technology, such as digital imaging and grading software, have enabled grading companies to provide more precise and consistent assessments of comic book condition.\nThe establishment of professional grading services and standardized grading criteria has had a profound impact on the comic book industry. It has provided collectors with greater confidence in assessing the condition and authenticity of comic books, thereby fostering a more transparent and efficient marketplace. Graded comic books often command higher prices than their ungraded counterparts, reflecting the added assurance of quality and authenticity provided by professional grading services.\n\n\n== Importance ==\nComic book grading plays a significant role in the comic book collecting hobby and industry, serving several key purposes that contribute to the integrity and efficiency of the marketplace.\nOne of the primary benefits of comic book grading is the establishment of standardized criteria for assessing a comic book's condition. By employing objective grading standards and numerical scales, such as those utilized by grading companies like CGC and CCG, collectors and sellers can communicate the condition of a comic book in a consistent and universally understood manner. This standardization helps to minimize ambiguity and discrepancies in condition assessments, facilitating smoother transactions between buyers and sellers.\nGraded comic books are encapsulated in protective cases that shield them from environmental factors such as light, moisture, and handling. This preservation not only helps to maintain the condition of the comic book over time but also protects it from damage and degradation. As a result, graded comic books are often considered to be in a more pristine and collectible state compared to their ungraded counterparts.\nProfessional grading services authenticate comic books, verifying their legitimacy and originality. The encapsulation of graded comic books with tamper-evident seals further ensures their authenticity, providing collectors with confidence in the integrity of their purchases. This assurance of authenticity is especially valuable in a market where counterfeit and altered comic books can be prevalent, offering peace of mind to collectors and investors alike.\nGraded comic books often command higher prices in the marketplace compared to their ungraded counterparts. This premium is attributed to the added assurance of quality, authenticity, and consistency provided by professional grading services. Moreover, the standardized grading scales employed by grading companies help to establish market benchmarks for pricing, facilitating more transparent and informed transactions between buyers and sellers. As a result, comic book grading plays a crucial role in determining the fair market value of collectible comic books.\nComic book grading has made the hobby more accessible and inclusive by providing collectors with a standardized method for evaluating and acquiring comic books. The encapsulation of graded comic books preserves their condition and prevents deterioration, making high-grade collectibles available to enthusiasts of all ages and backgrounds. Additionally, the transparency and objectivity of grading standards help to foster trust and confidence within the collecting community, encouraging participation and engagement among newcomers and seasoned collectors alike.\n\n\n== Grading companies ==\nProfessional grading companies play a crucial role in the comic book collecting hobby by providing authentication, grading, and encapsulation services for comic books. These companies employ trained experts and utilize standardized grading criteria to assess the condition and authenticity of comic books, offering collectors and sellers a reliable and trusted means of evaluating their collectibles.\n\n\n=== CGC (Certified Guaranty Company) ===\nFounded in 2000, Certified Guaranty Company (CGC) is one of the leading grading companies in the comic book industry. CGC employs a team of experienced graders who assess comic books according to a standardized grading scale ranging from 0.5 to 10.0. CGC-certified comic books are encapsulated in tamper-evident cases and accompanied by labels indicating the comic's grade and pertinent details. CGC has become synonymous with quality and reliability in the comic book collecting community, with its graded comics often commanding premium prices in the marketplace.\n\n\n=== Comics Guaranty LLC (CGC) ===\nComics Guaranty LLC (CGC), not to be confused with the Certified Guaranty Company (CGC), was a grading company founded in the early 1980s by Phil Seuling. CGC was one of the pioneering grading companies in the comic book industry, introducing the concept of third-party grading and encapsulation. While CGC ceased operations in the late 1980s, its contributions to the development of comic book grading and authentication laid the groundwork for modern grading practices.\n\n\n=== Certified Collectibles Group (CCG) ===\nCertified Collectibles Group (CCG) is the parent company of CGC as well as other grading services specializing in coins, paper money, and trading cards. CCG provides grading and authentication services for a variety of collectibles, including comic books, through its subsidiary, CGC. With a focus on accuracy, consistency, and customer service, CCG has established itself as a trusted authority in the grading and certification of collectible items.\n\n\n=== PGX (Professional Grading Experts) ===\nProfessional Grading Experts (PGX) is a grading company that provides authentication and grading services for comic books. Established in 2002, PGX employs a team of expert graders who assess comic books according to standardized grading criteria. PGX-certified comic books are encapsulated in tamper-evident cases and accompanied by labels indicating the comic's grade and pertinent details. While PGX is among the grading companies in the comic book industry, it has garnered attention for its competitive pricing and relatively quick turnaround times. However, PGX has faced criticism and controversy regarding grading consistency and perceived grading leniency compared to other grading companies. Despite these challenges, PGX continues to offer an alternative option for collectors seeking grading and authentication services for their comic book collections.\n\n\n=== CBCS (Comic Book Certification Service) ===\nComic Book Certification Service (CBCS) is a grading company that specializes in the authentication and grading of comic books. Founded in 2014 by Steve Borock, a former grader and authenticator for CGC, CBCS has quickly gained recognition in the comic book collecting community.

CBCS is known for its competitive pricing, customer service, and emphasis on grading accuracy. While CBCS operates as a competitor to other grading companies such as CGC and PGX, it has earned a loyal following among collectors seeking alternative grading options.\nIn addition, several other grading companies operate in the comic book industry, offering alternative options for collectors seeking grading and authentication services. These companies may employ their own grading standards and criteria, and their services may vary in terms of pricing, turnaround time, and reputation within the collecting community. Examples of other grading companies include EGS (Expert Grading Services) and Canadian-based CPS (Collectible Protective Services).\nGrading companies have had a significant impact on the comic book collecting hobby, providing collectors with confidence in the authenticity and quality of their collectibles. However, they have also faced criticism and controversy, particularly regarding grading inconsistencies, perceived biases, and the influence of graded comics on market dynamics. Despite these challenges, grading companies continue to play a vital role in shaping the comic book collecting landscape.\n\n\n== Standard grading scales ==\nComic book grading scales are standardized systems used to evaluate the condition of comic books. Grading scales provide collectors, sellers, and enthusiasts with a common language for describing the condition of comic books, facilitating transactions and ensuring transparency within the marketplace. While various grading scales exist, they typically assess factors such as cover gloss, page quality, spine integrity, and any defects or imperfections present in the comic. This article provides an overview of some of the most commonly used grading scales in the comic book industry.\n\n\n=== 10-Point Scale ===\nOne of the most widely used grading scales in the comic book industry is the 10-point scale, which assigns a numerical grade to comic books ranging from 0.5 to 10.0. Each numerical grade corresponds to a specific condition category, with higher grades indicating better condition. The scale typically includes the following categories:\n\n10.0: Gem Mint\n9.9: Mint\n9.8: Near Mint/Mint\n9.6: Near Mint +\n9.4: Near Mint\n9.2: Near Mint -\n9.0: Very Fine/Near Mint\n8.5: Very Fine +\n8.0: Very Fine\n7.5: Very Fine -\n7.0: Fine/Very Fine\n6.5: Fine +\n6.0: Fine\n5.5: Fine -\n5.0: Very Good/Fine\n4.5: Very Good +\n4.0: Very Good\n3.5: Very Good -\n3.0: Good/Very Good\n2.5: Good +\n2.0: Good\n1.8: Good -\n1.5: Fair/Good\n1.0: Fair\n0.5: Poor\n\n\n=== Abbreviated Grading Scale ===\nAnother common grading scale used in the comic book industry is the abbreviated grading scale, which assigns letter grades to comic books based on their condition. This scale typically includes the following categories:\n\nNM: Near Mint\nVF: Very Fine\nFN: Fine\nVG: Very Good\nGD: Good\nFR: Fair\nPR: Poor\n\n\n=== CPS Percentage Scale ===\nThe CPS Grading Scale was introduced by Collectible protection Services in 2023. This scale typically includes the following categories:\n\n100%: Gem Mint\n99%: Mint\n98%: Near Mint/Mint\n96%: Near Mint +\n94%: Near Mint\n92%: Near Mint -\n90%: Very Fine/Near Mint\n85%: Very Fine +\n80%: Very Fine\n75%: Very Fine -\n70%: Fine/Very Fine\n65%: Fine +\n60%: Fine\n55%: Fine -\n50%: Very Good/Fine\n45%: Very Good +\n40%: Very Good\n35%: Very Good -\n30%: Good/Very Good\n25%: Good +\n20%: Good\n18%: Good -\n15%: Fair/Good\n10%: Fair\n5%: Poor\n\n\n=== Grading companies and their scales ===\nGrading companies such as Certified Guaranty Company (CGC), Comic Book Certification Service (CBCS), Expert Grading Services (EGS), Collectible Protective Services (CPS) and Professional Grading Experts (PGX) employ their own grading scales and criteria for evaluating comic books. While these grading scales may vary slightly in their terminology and methodology, they generally adhere to the principles of the standard grading scales outlined above.\n\n\n=== Importance of grading scales ===\nComic book grading scales play a crucial role in the comic book collecting hobby and industry by providing collectors with a standardized method for assessing the condition of comic books. Grading scales help to establish market benchmarks for pricing, facilitate transparent transactions between buyers and sellers, and ensure the integrity and authenticity of collectible comic books.\n\n\n=== Criticism and controversy ===\nWhile grading scales serve an important function within the comic book community, they have also faced criticism and controversy. Some collectors and enthusiasts argue that grading scales are inherently subjective and open to interpretation, leading to inconsistencies and discrepancies in grading assessments. Additionally, debates have arisen over the impact of graded comics on market dynamics, with concerns raised about the influence of graded comics on pricing and accessibility within the hobby.\n\n\n== Process of comic book grading ==\nThe process of comic book grading involves the assessment and assigning of a numerical grade to a comic book's condition. Grading is performed by trained professionals who evaluate various factors to determine the overall state of the comic book. This article provides an overview of the steps involved in the process of comic book grading.\n\n\n=== Visual inspection ===\nThe grading process begins with a visual inspection of the comic book. Graders carefully examine the cover, spine, corners, edges, and pages for any signs of wear, damage, or imperfections. Factors such as cover gloss, color vibrancy, and page quality are assessed during this stage. Graders also look for any creases, tears, folds, stains, or writing that may affect the comic book's condition.\n\n\n=== Grading criteria ===\nComic book grading is based on standardized criteria that take into account various aspects of a comic book's condition. Graders consider factors such as:\nCover Gloss: The sheen and luster of the comic book cover.\nPage Quality: The condition of the pages, including discoloration, tears, and stains.\nSpine Integrity: The condition of the comic book spine, including any stress marks, breaks, or creases.\nCorners and Edges: The sharpness and integrity of the comic book corners and edges.\nCreases and Folds: The presence of any creases, folds, or bends in the comic book.\nTears and Damage: Any tears, rips, or other damage to the comic book cover or pages.\nWriting and Markings: The presence of any writing, markings, or stamps on the comic book.\nGrading Scale\nOnce the visual inspection and assessment of grading criteria are complete, the comic book is assigned a numerical grade based on a standardized grading scale. Common grading scales include the 10-point scale and the abbreviated letter scale, which range from \"Poor\" to \"Gem Mint\" or equivalent categories. The assigned grade reflects the overall condition of the comic book, with higher grades indicating better condition.\n\n\n=== Encapsulation and labeling ===\nAfter grading, the comic book is encapsulated in a protective case to preserve its condition and integrity. The encapsulation process involves sealing the comic book in a tamper-evident case made of durable materials such as plastic. A label containing information about the comic book's grade, title, issue number, and other pertinent details is affixed to the case. Encapsulation helps to protect the comic book from environmental factors such as light, moisture, and handling, while also providing assurance of authenticity and condition.\n\n\n== Notable graded comic books ==\nNotable graded comic books are collectible issues that have been professionally graded and encapsulated by grading companies, and that are highly sought after by collectors due to their historical significance, rarity, or cultural impact. These may also be referred to as \"grail books\" by collectors and enthusiasts. This article provides an overview of some of the most notable graded comic books in the comic book collecting hobby.\n\n\n=== Action Comics #1 (1938) ===\nAction Comics #1 is widely regarded as one of the most significant comic books in history, as it features the first appearance of Superman, the iconic superhero created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. Graded copies of Action Comics #1, especially those in higher grades, are highly coveted by collectors and enthusiasts. In 2014, a copy of Action Comics #1 graded CGC 9.0 (Near Mint) sold for a record-breaking $3.2 million, making it one of the most expensive comic books ever sold. On April 4, 2024, a copy of Action Comics #1 graded CGC 8.5 (Off white pages; Kansas City Pedigree) set an auction record of $6,000,000.\n\n\n=== Detective Comics #27 (1939) ===\nDetective Comics #27 is notable for introducing another iconic superhero, Batman, created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger. The issue features the first appearance of Batman and has become one of the most valuable and sought-after comic books in the world. Graded copies of Detective Comics #27, particularly those in high grades, command significant premiums in the collector's market.\n\n\n=== Amazing Fantasy #15 (1962) ===\nAmazing Fantasy #15 is famous for featuring the first appearance of Spider-Man, the beloved Marvel Comics character created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. The issue marks the beginning of one of the most successful and enduring superhero franchises in comic book history. Graded copies of Amazing Fantasy #15, especially those in excellent condition, are highly prized by collectors and enthusiasts.\n\n\n=== Action Comics #252 (1959) ===\nAction Comics #252 is notable for introducing Supergirl, the female counterpart to Superman, to the DC Comics universe. The issue features the first appearance of Supergirl, also known as Kara Zor-El, and has become a key collectible for fans of the character. Graded copies of Action Comics #252, particularly those with high grades and well-preserved covers, are sought after by collectors of Superman and DC Comics memorabilia.\n\n\n=== Batman #1 (1940) ===\nBatman #1 is significant for being the first solo comic book series featuring Batman, following his debut in Detective Comics #27. The issue includes the first appearances of several important characters, including the Joker and Catwoman. Graded copies of Batman #1, especially those in high grades and well-preserved condition, are highly valued by collectors and enthusiasts of Batman and DC Comics.\n\n\n== Comic book grading criticisms and controversies ==\nComic book grading, while providing collectors with a standardized method for assessing the condition and value of comic books, has faced criticism and controversy within the comic book collecting community. This article explores some of the common criticisms and controversies surrounding comic book grading.\n\n\n=== Subjectivity and interpretation ===\nOne of the primary criticisms of comic book grading is the inherent subjectivity and interpretation involved in the grading process. Despite the use of standardized grading scales and criteria, grading can be influenced by individual graders' opinions, biases, and interpretations of grading guidelines. This subjectivity can lead to inconsistencies and discrepancies in grading assessments, with different graders assigning different grades to the same comic book.\n\n\n=== Grading company bias ===\nAnother source of controversy in comic book grading is the perception of bias among grading companies. Some collectors and enthusiasts have raised concerns about the impartiality of grading companies and the influence of their grading practices on market dynamics. Allegations of favoritism towards certain publishers, characters, or creators have led to skepticism and mistrust within the collecting community.\n\n\n=== Grading inconsistencies ===\nGrading inconsistencies are a common issue that critics point out in the comic book grading process. Variations in grading assessments between different grading companies, as well as within the same grading company, have been reported. Factors such as grading leniency, grading standards, and quality control measures can contribute to inconsistencies in grading assessments, leading to frustration and disillusionment among collectors.\n\n\n=== Impact on market dynamics ===\nThe increasing prevalence of graded comic books in the marketplace has raised concerns about their impact on market dynamics. Some collectors argue that the rise of graded comics has led to inflated prices and artificial scarcity, as graded copies command premiums over their ungraded counterparts. Additionally, the emphasis on graded comics in the collector's market has raised questions about the accessibility and affordability of comic book collecting for new enthusiasts.\n\n\n=== Manipulation and fraud ===\nThe encapsulation of graded comic books in tamper-evident cases has led to concerns about manipulation and fraud within the grading process. Critics argue that the tamper-evident cases can be compromised, allowing for the alteration or substitution of comic books. Allegations of trimming, restoration, and forgery have surfaced, casting doubt on the authenticity and integrity of graded comic books and grading companies.\n\n\n== See also ==\nComic book collecting\nComic book price guide\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttps://www.cgccomics.com/news/article/12809/action-comics-superman-record-6million/",

Established in 1979, the company's main products include many types of glycine, such as industrial-grade glycine, refined glycine, as well as glycine derivatives. It is regarded as a key player in the global glycine market.\n\n\n== Social media ==\nIn October 2023, Donghua Jinlong began posting short promotional videos showcasing their expertise and prominent role in the manufacturing of glycine on the social media platform TikTok. As a result of TikTok's recommendation algorithm, these videos appeared on many users' \"for you page\", which displays a feed of recommended videos to TikTok users. On March 31st 2024, a TikTok user posted a parody of one of these commercials, using an AI voice imitation of Red Scare podcaster Dasha Nekrasova, with the video receiving over 124,800 plays and 13,500 likes in two days. Subsequently, Donghua Jinlong became a meme amongst TikTok users, in which they expressed a tongue-in-cheek excitement towards the chemical manufacturer and its industry-specific content online. Many \"fan-made\" infomercials praising the company and its products have since been posted online.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "The Kansas City and Pacific Railroad (“KC&PR”) was created in 1886 to provide a freight access route from Kansas City south through what was then Oklahoma Territory, now the State of Oklahoma.  The line grew to 130 miles of trackage before the company was merged in 1899 into a predecessor of former class-1 rail carrier Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Parsons and Pacific Railroad ===\nThe prehistory of the KC&PR may be said to begin with the Parsons and Pacific Railroad, which was incorporated in Kansas on December 16, 1885.  It constructed a line of about 31.25 miles between Parsons, Kansas and Coffeyville, Kansas.  That railroad was sold to the KC&PR on July 27, 1887.\n\n\n=== KC&PR ===\nThe KC&PR was incorporated in Kansas on July 24, 1886.  The objective was to get the right to build south though Oklahoma, and toward that goal the railroad secured a grant from the U.S. Congress to do so, dated May 14, 1888.  The grant came with stipulations as to meeting certain milestones of progress over time.  The KC&PR started from the Kansas/Oklahoma border, but instead of building the line south, it turned most of its attention to securing a connection north to Kansas City.  It incorporated the line obtained from the Parsons and Pacific Railroad with additional trackage to create a route between Coffeyville, Kansas and Paola, Kansas, about 125 miles.  The only progress it made in the other direction was a route about 5 miles south from Coffeyville, only about 2.7 miles of which was actually in Oklahoma.  This gave the railroad about 130 miles of owned line.  But the railroad also obtained a traffic arrangement with the Kansas City, Fort Scott and Memphis Railroad which allowed KC&PR trains to go all the way into Kansas City.  The KC&PR went back to Congress in 1890 to get an extension of time to build into Oklahoma.  On March 28, 1890, the KC&PR was granted two years from May 14, 1890 (i.e., until May 14, 1892) to build its first hundred miles of line in Oklahoma, and two years after that to complete all Oklahoma trackage.\n\n\n=== Sale ===\nBut the Oklahoma extension was not to be.  The railroad was valuable to what became the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad, known as the “Katy,” because of those traffic rights into Kansas City.  So on November 24, 1899, the KC&PR was consolidated with the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway Company (an 1865 corporation) to form a new Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway Company.  While the Katy had other lines in Oklahoma, neither the KC&PR nor the new Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway Company built any additional Oklahoma trackage.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Étienne Nzimbi Ngbale Kongo wa Bassa was a Zairean general who served in the Presidential Guard of Mobutu Sese Seko. Ngbale, as Mobutu's cousin, served as a commander of the Special Presidential Division until the fall of Zaire in 1997.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nNgbale was born in Libenge, Belgian Congo on December 6, 1944, to a Ngbandi family. He began his military career in the 1960s and 1970s, serving in the Israeli Army. In the late 1970s, he took control of the Special Presidential Brigade (BSP), which later became the Special Presidential Division protecting Mobutu Sese Seko from attempted coups. Ngbale's DSP was considered the most feared of the Zairean army, consisting of 6,000 to 10,000 men including foreign mercenaries. Ngbale heavily recruited Ngbandi to join the DSP. The DSP under Ngbale was also known for numerous human rights abuses, and the detention and torture of political opponents.\nDuring the First Congo War as Kinshasa fell to Congolese rebels, Ngbale told Mobutu that he \"could not defend him anymore.\" Ngbale, only in control of around 2,000 soldiers in the DSP, attempted to launch a missile on Mobutu's plane as he flew back to his palace in Gbadolite similar to the strike that killed Rwandan president Juvénal Habyarimana in 1994, but Mobutu had been tipped off about the attempted assassination.\nNgbale fled Kinshasa to Brazzaville by boat on May 17, 1997. Remaining soldiers of his DSP shot and killed Zairian chief of staff Mahele Lieko Bokungu as he tried to calm troops that were preparing for an advance by Congolese rebels. Nzimbi died on September 28, 2005, in a Belgian hospital.\n\n\n== References ==",

He took on his first senior managerial role in 2009, taking charge of regional league club Wilga Garwolin, where he stayed until 2011.\nHe then had stints with lower division clubs such as Radość Warsaw, Start Otwock and Victoria Sulejówek.\n\n\n=== Assistant roles ===\nOn 18 April 2016, Kędziorek joined Marek Papszun's staff at Raków Częstochowa as an assistant. While at the club, Kędziorek oversaw Raków's ascent from II liga to Ekstraklasa, before leaving on 29 December 2019.\nHighly regarded for his match analysis and set-pieces, Kędziorek was invited by Poland under-21 team manager Czesław Michniewicz to join his staff for the 2019 UEFA Euro U21.\nOn 11 May 2020, he moved to I liga club Arka Gdynia to operate as an assistant coach. On 18 June 2021, after working with head coaches Ireneusz Mamrot and Dariusz Marzec, he left the Pomeranian side by mutual consent.\nHe spent the following two-and-a-half years as an assistant for Ekstraklasa side Lech Poznań whom he joined on 21 June 2021; in his first year with the club, Lech won the 2021–22 Ekstraklasa title under manager Maciej Skorża, and followed it up during the 2022–23 season with a successful European campaign, reaching the UEFA Europa Conference League quarterfinals with John van den Brom in charge.\n\n\n=== Radomiak Radom ===\nOn 1 December 2023, he left Lech to take charge of Ekstraklasa club Radomiak Radom. The following day, Radomiak won their first game under Kędziorek, securing a decisive 0–3 away win over Widzew Łódź. In their last game of 2023, Kędziorek led Radomiak to a 2–2 comeback draw against Lech on 16 December, resulting in his former supervisor van den Brom's sacking the next day.\n\n\n== Managerial statistics ==\nAs of match played 5 April 2024\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Trey Parker is directing an upcoming American comedy film from a screenplay by Vernon Chatman. It will be produced by Parker, Matt Stone, Kendrick Lamar, and Dave Free. Paramount Pictures will distribute the film, which is set to be released to theaters on July 4, 2025.\n\n\n== Premise ==\nAccording to a previous synopsis, the film will depict the past and present coming to a head, when a young Black man who is interning as a slave reenactor at a living history museum discovers that his white girlfriend's ancestors once owned his.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nTrey Parker and Matt Stone have worked with Vernon Chatman on their animated sitcom South Park since 2001; in addition to serving as a producer and writing consultant for the series, Chatman voices the anthropomorphic recurring character Towelie.\nThe untitled film will mark the first theatrical collaboration, and second overall, between Parker, Stone, Kendrick Lamar, and Dave Free. Parker and Stone developed the deepfakes used in the music video for Lamar's promotional single \"The Heart Part 5\" (2022) through their artificial intelligence startup studio Deep Voodoo. The film will also mark the first feature film to be produced through PGLang, Lamar and Free's creative company, and Park County, Parker and Stone's re-named production company.\n\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nThe untitled live action film was announced by Deadline Hollywood on January 13, 2022. Chatman penned the screenplay, which Brian Robbins, president and chief executive officer of Paramount Pictures, called \"one of the funniest and original scripts\" he has ever read. When news broke of the film's development, a director was not yet attached. By March 2023, Parker had reportedly signed on to direct the film.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nFilming was scheduled to commence in the spring of 2022, but was pushed back due to Parker and Stone's prior commitments to South Park. Paramount confirmed during their CinemaCon presentation on April 11, 2024, that production would begin during the summer.\n\n\n== Release ==\nParamount Pictures will handle its theatrical distribution, home entertainment, and television licensing rights, with Paramount+ acquiring its streaming rights. In an accompanying statement, Robbins wrote that the film studio and the wider ViacomCBS family were \"look[ing] forward to ushering in the first theatrical collaboration from these creative visionaries, and galvanizing audiences worldwide around a powerful storytelling experience.\" The untitled film is scheduled to be released in theaters on July 4, 2025, in a nod to American Independence Day.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was the sole publication targeting Hungarian women in the country.\n\n\n== History and profile ==\nDolgozó nő was established in Cluj in 1945. The magazine came out monthly and was printed in Hungarian. It was the sister publication of Femeia, a Romanian women's magazine.\nDolgozó nő targeted Hungarian women living in Romania who were the members of the Communist women’s mass organization, the Union of Antifascist Women of Romania. It was modelled on Soviet women's magazines and featured articles on women's rights, their condition in the modern society, health, beauty, housework, literature and fashion topics. It also encouraged the participation of women in politics and covered materials on literature and history.\nDolgozó nő folded in 1989 when the Communist regime fell as a result of the Romanian Revolution.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Pleasant Prairie Premium Outlets, formerly Lakeside Marketplace and Prime Outlets at Kenosha, is an open-air outlet mall in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, a suburb of Kenosha located near the border with Illinois and which is part of the greater Chicago metropolitan area. The mall sits next to Interstate 94, and is approximately 50 miles north of Chicago and 40 miles south of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The mall was developed by the McArthurGlen Group, and was built in stages between 1988 and 1992. Since 2010, it has been owned by Simon Property Group and managed as part of Simon's Premium Outlets division.\n\n\n== History ==\nPlans for Lakeside Marketplace were announced by Glen Investors, a subsidiary of McArthurGlen Group based in Washington, D.C., in January 1988. At the time, the Kenosha area already had an outlet mall in Bristol, the Factory Outlet Centre, which had been built in 1982, three miles further north along Interstate 94. Construction proceeded quickly, with some stores opening for business as early as September 1988. A grand opening ceremony was held for the first phase of the mall, consisting of 23 stores and 75,000 square feet of space, on November 2, 1988, with Lieutenant Governor Scott McCallum cutting the ceremonial ribbon. Major manufacturers with outlet stores in the first phase included Liz Claiborne and Calvin Klein.The mall's second phase added another 17 stores, including J. Crew, Oleg Cassini, and Benetton, as well as an Oshkosh B'Gosh outlet which moved from the Factory Outlet Centre in Bristol to Lakeside Marketplace. The second phase opened on October 19, 1989, by which time construction was already underway on a further expansion of the mall. Phase III added 20 more stores and was completed in August 1990. The fourth and final phase of the mall, as originally planned, opened on February 15, 1992. Lakeside Marketplace was then considered complete, with a total of 76 stores and restaurants in 269,300 square feet of space.According to the Kenosha News in 1990, most customers at Lakeside Marketplace came from out of town, particularly the Chicago area, and few Kenosha residents shopped there. The mall was the second most popular tourist attraction in Kenosha County, behind only Dairyland Greyhound Park. Before construction on the mall was complete, McArthurGlen offered to sell an ownership stake in the property as the developer tried to raise funds for future projects. The opening of the much larger Gurnee Mills outlet mall, 10 miles south of Pleasant Prairie, in August 1991 added new competition for both of Kenosha County's outlet malls.In 1995, McArthurGlen merged with Horizon Outlet Centers of Muskegon, Michigan to form Horizon Group Inc., also known as HGI Realty. Horizon sold 22 of its outlet malls, including Lakeside Marketplace, to Prime Retail LP on June 15, 1998. Immediately after the sale was finalized, Lakeside Marketplace was rebranded as \"Prime Outlets at Kenosha\".The mall was substantially expanded and renovated in 2006. Phases I and II of the original mall (now known as South Plaza), as well as one corner of Phases III and IV (now North Plaza), were partially torn down to allow for easier movement between the shops on either side. A third retail area, East Plaza, was built behind North Plaza. At the center of the mall area, The Eatery Dining Pavilion was added, with a prominent clock tower. These changes were planned as early as 1999, but construction did not begin until the summer of 2006. Many of the tenants in the new addition came from Bristol's outlet mall, which was demolished the same year after a long decline in sales. The expanded Prime Outlets held a ribbon-cutting ceremony at midnight on Black Friday, November 24, 2006.Prime Outlets was purchased by Simon Property Group in September 2010, and the malls were added to Simon's Premium Outlets division. With the change in ownership, the mall was renamed Pleasant Prairie Premium Outlets.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "On 16 February 1995, 35-year-old Thai worker Somwang Yapapha (Thai: สมหวัง ยะภาภา) was battered to death by two of his compatriots during a drinking session at a Defu Lane flatted factory in Singapore. His murderers - Khampun Sriyotha (Thai: คำปัน ศรีโยธา) and Samlee Prathumtree (Thai: สำลี ปทุมตรี) - were arrested soon after they killed Somwang, and they were charged with murder. Despite their differing accounts of the murder, Khampun and Samlee both put up a defence that there was a fight between them all while they were drinking, which caused the two defendants to bludgeon Somwang to death during the fight itself. However, the High Court rejected their defence, and the pair were hence found guilty of murdering Somwang and sentenced to death in November 1995. Both Samlee and Khampun lost their appeals, and they were jointly hanged on 4 July 1997.\n\n\n== Murder and investigations ==\nOn 16 February 1995, the police received a report that a 35-year-old Thai construction worker died at a flatted factory in Defu Lane, Singapore.\nThe deceased Thai national, identified as 35-year-old Somwang Yapapha, was found with severe head injuries while he laid in a pool of blood, and his jaw was also smashed while his face and body were found with cuts caused by pieces of broken glass (some of which were embedded in the multiple open wounds). Shattered glass shards from a broken beer bottle were found scattered around the floor where Somwang's corpse was laid. On that same day, a 45-year-old Thai construction worker surrendered himself after he admitted to his employer that he was responsible for the murder, and the police report was thus made and the officers subsequently took him in for further probe and investigations. The police uncovered through first-stage investigations that the homicide likely happened between the suspect and the victim during a drunken argument while they were drinking heavily.\nA forensic pathologist later examined Somwang's body, and it was found that there were not less than 20 injuries all over his body, and most of these injuries were concentrated on the neck and head. Among these injuries were four skull fractures, and two of them were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. The injuires, according to the pathologist, were caused by a heavy object and there were no defensive injuries found on the victim. It was confirmed through police investigations that a sledgehammer was used to kill Somwang.\nAltogether, after some investigations, the police arrested two Thai construction workers, including the 45-year-old man who surrendered, for the murder of Somwang. The two men, 45-year-old Samlee Prathumtree and 32-year-old Khampun Sriyotha, were charged in court with murder and subsequently remanded without bail while awaiting trial for murder.\n\n\n== Murder trial and sentencing ==\nOn 17 August 1995, both Khampun Sriyotha and Samlee Prathumtree officially claimed trial for the murder of Somwang Yapapha. The trial, which took place at the High Court, was presided over by the late Justice T S Sinnathuray, a veteran Supreme Court judge who was notable for sentencing infamous child killer Adrian Lim to death for murdering two children in 1981, as well as British serial killer John Martin Scripps for killing and dismembering a South African tourist in 1995. Khampun was represented by James Bahadur Masih and Christopher Teh, while Samlee was represented by Low Tiang Hock and N K Rajarh, and the prosecution was led by Luke Tan Loke Yong and Wong Keen Onn.\nThe trial court was told that prior to the lethal sledgehammer attack, Samlee and Somwang did not have a good relationship with each other despite being neighbours back in Thailand. Samlee earlier told police that Somwang was previously incarcerated for a sexual crime, and he also engaged in petty offences like stealing cars. Somwang also proclaimed himself to be a hired professional killer who had killed many people for a living, and Somwang, who first came to Singapore in January 1995, about ten months later than Samlee (who first arrived in February 1994), often borrowed money from Samlee for gambling and alcohol. It was adduced from the men's statements that on 14 February 1995 (two days before the murder), Samlee had been threatened by a drunken Somwang with a hammer during a regular drinks session that he would be killed and have his body burnt, and although Somwang later apologized once he became sober, he continued to glare at him for the following day while at work. It was the prosecution's case that due to their interpersonal conflicts, Samlee intended to kill Somwang and Khampun, who was Samlee's close friend and employed at a neighbouring construction site, joined in the plot out of sympathy for Samlee and thus, it culminated into the murder of Somwang sometime between 9.30pm on 15 February and 1.30am on 16 February 1994.\nIn his defence, Samlee did not dispute the events that happened before the murder, but Samlee denied there was any intention or plan to kill Somwang. He said that on the same night when Somwang was killed, the two accused and the victim drank together, and in midst of their second session, an argument broke out between Khampun and Somwang, and it escalated into a fight between both Somwang and Khampun, who was hit with a beer bottle by Somwang. In retaliation, Khampun used a sledgehammer to batter Somwang, and Samlee thus escaped and went into hiding out of fear. Samlee, who pinpointed Khampun as the one who killed Somwang, admitted that after the end of the fight, he came out of his hiding place and saw Somwang lying face downwards on the floor motionless, and to confirm if Somwang had died, Samlee picked up the bloodstained sledgehammer and tapped once at the head of Somwang, in addition to a hard blow on the head as he recalled the death threat which Samlee spewed at him.\nAs for Khampun, his own version of events was that after they invited Somwang to have drinks, Somwang got aggressive with Samlee and argued with him, and Khampun also tried to restore peace between the two men, and yet the situation was aggravated further when Somwang hit him with a bottle, and Khampun thus used a clawhammer to bludgeon Somwang on the head, neck and jaw before he fled the scene, and the fight between Somwang and both the defendants ended with Somwang's death. Khampun also denied that he heard anything from Samlee about his interpersonal conflicts with Somwang. Despite the differing accounts from both men, the similarity in both version of events recounted by Samlee and Khampun was that the death of Somwang was unfortunately the result of a sudden but violent drunken brawl and there was no intent to commit murder in the first place, which formed the main crux of their defence in court.\nOn 28 November 1995, Justice T S Sinnathuray delivered his verdict. In his judgement, Justice Sinnathuray found that both Samlee and Khampun had the clear intention to cause the death of Somwang, especially Samlee who had the motive to commit the murder itself and thus roped his younger friend and confidant Khampun in the killing, and rejected the duo's defences in favour of the prosecution's submission. Justice Sinnathuray added that there was sufficient evidence to show that both Samlee and Khampun methodically lured Somwang to his death by inviting him for drinks, and attacked him after they started an argument on purpose, and thereafter used the sledgehammer to batter Somwang to death. The judge also noted that Samlee took steps to cover up the murder as one caused by a fight and he clearly did not tap but smashed the sledgehammer onto Somwang's head, and he also determined that both Khampun and Samlee had each took turns to hammer Somwang at least once, and the injuries which they intentionally inflicted on Somwang were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, and these were also done in furtherance of their common intention to launch the concerted attack that ultimately took Somwang's life. On these grounds, Justice Sinnathuray concluded that the pair were ought to be convicted of the charges preferred against them for unlawfully causing Somwang's death.\nAs a result, both Samlee Prathumtree and Khampun Sriyotha, then aged 45 and 32 respectively, were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death by hanging. Prior to 2013, all four degrees of murder carried the mandatory death penalty in accordance to Section 302 of the Penal Code upon the conviction of an offender for murder.\n\n\n== Appeal process ==\nOn 21 August 1996, the Court of Appeal dismissed the two men's appeals and confirmed their death sentences. The three appellate judges - Justice M Karthigesu, Justice Thean Lip Ping (L P Thean) and Justice Goh Joon Seng - found that both Khampun and Samlee had shared the common intention to cause grievous hurt to Somwang, which in turn had resulted in the murder of Somwang, and the evidence proved that both men had the premeditation and planning to lure Somwang out with an excuse of inviting him for drinks and later killed him. Justice Karthigesu, who delivered the judgement, cited the forensic findings that the victim died from two fatal skull fractures (either one alone would have also caused death), which were caused by the ruthless and intentional assault caused by the two appellants, who both did so in furtherance of the common intention to cause harm and even the death of Somwang. In turn, Justice Karthigesu pronounced that the two appellants' respective defences should be rejected in view of the evidence that were enough to convict them of murder. Hence, the Court of Appeal affirmed the death penalty and murder conviction of both Samlee and Khampun, leading to the two men failing to escape the gallows.\n\n\n== Double execution ==\nOn the Friday morning of 4 July 1997, 34-year-old Khampun Sriyotha and 47-year-old Samlee Prathumtree were both hanged in Changi Prison for murdering Somwang Yapapha two years prior.\nDuring that same morning, three more drug traffickers were hanged in the same prison alongside both Samlee and Khampun. Two of them, Singaporeans Abdul Rahman Yusof and La Abuhari La Odd Hamid, were convicted and sent to death row for to the joint trafficking of more than 590g of marijuana in August 1995, while the third, Singaporean Low Theng Gee (also spelt Low Theng Ghee), was found guilty of smuggling more than 31g of diamorphine in January 1996; in an unrelated case, Low notoriously masterminded the kidnapping of two police officers during that same year. Low was not tried for this abduction case since he was already on death row for drug trafficking, but his accomplice and convicted robber Abdul Nasir Amer Hamsah was alone found guilty of the kidnapping and given both caning and a life sentence on top of the 18 years he got for the other crime of robbing a Japanese woman (who died during the robbery bid).\nKhampun and Samlee were one of the three Thais reported to be executed in Singapore during the year of 1997. Six months before their double executions, 30-year-old Thai citizen Pracha Thanomnin was hanged on 10 January 1997 for robbing and murdering a 47-year-old taxi driver Lee Kok Yin with three other Thais, two of whom remains at large till today and a third was convicted of attempted robbery and jailed for five years. Coupled with the executions of 11 drug traffickers and an infamous gunman Lim Chwee Soon, a total of 15 people were put to death in Singapore during the year of 1997.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCapital punishment in Singapore\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On December 20, 2008, Tuareg rebels from the Niger-Mali Tuareg Alliance attacked Malian forces in Nampala, Mali.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIbrahim Ag Bahanga, the leader of the Malian Tuareg rebel group Niger-Mali Tuareg Alliance (ATNM), had returned to Mali from exile in Libya just before December 2008. Bahanga's ATNM was one of the last Tuareg rebel groups active during the Tuareg rebellion, as his previous group May 23, 2006 Democratic Alliance for Change (ADC) had signed an Algerian-brokered peace agreement months prior. Beginning on December 18, 2008, Bahanga's ATNM started attacking Malian forces again.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nOn December 20, ATNM fighters attacked the Malian garrison at Nampala after travelling around a thousand kilometers from their bases in Algeria. The ATNM convoy was spotted en route by American satellites, but Malian officials dismissed the warning. The assault began around 3am, with ATNM using fifty men on around 15 to 16 pick-ups to conduct the attack. Malian security sources alleged that the Niger Movement for Justice (MNJ) was embedded with the ATNM. The initial attack was repelled by Malian forces, but rebels that had recently integrated into the Malian army mutinied and killed their company commander. The mutiny sowed panic between Malian troops, and the garrison was taken in a second ATNM attack. Malian reinforcements then arrived at Nampala.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe Malian Ministry of Defense stated nine soldiers and eleven rebels were killed in the attack. Malian newspaper L'Essor put the toll at fifteen Malian soldiers killed and thirteen injured, with many more missing. Sources close to the ATNM alleged that twenty Malian soldiers were killed, and several civilians were killed in the attack as well.\nThe Nampala attack ended negotiations between rebel groups and the Malian government. Malian President Amadou Toumani Touré ordered colonels El Hadj Ag Gamou and Ould Meydou to begin Operation Djigutugu to destroy ATNM bases in and around northern Mali.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Burgplatz (in English Castle square) is an approximately rectangular square of just over 2,000 square metres (22,000 square feet) in the southwest of the city center of Leipzig, Germany.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Burgplatz was created around 1900 on parts of the Pleissenburg site when it was demolished in 1897 to make room for the New Town Hall. The town hall was deliberately built a little out of town to create a new town square. The Burgplatz, whose name refers to the Pleissenburg, is the youngest of the inner-city squares. The Rathausbrunnen (Town hall fountain) by Georg Wrba was inaugurated on the square near the New Town Hall in 1908.\nBy the bombing of Leipzig in World War II, the square's entire peripheral development was destroyed or severely damaged. After clearing work, the castle square was only bordered by the town hall and the connected Stadthaus, the remaining structural enclosure was missing. It was used as a parking lot during the GDR era. There were also makeshift sales stalls on the extensive war gap, which stretched eastwards to Petersstrasse.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nAfter the German reunification, the rededication into an urban square began; the peripheral development was supplemented by new buildings, some of which are based on the character of the original building structure.\n\n\n== Current development and design ==\nThe New Town Hall closes off the square to the south and southwest, and the Stadthaus is to the west. Both buildings serve the city administration and are connected to each other by a two-story “bridge”.\nThe new building of the Bauwens House has been the end of the square to the north since 1994. The “Teiche House” previously stood on this site and was damaged in the war and later demolished. In the southeast there is an extension that was also added to the Deutsche Bank building in the 1990s with a tower-like risalit ; it takes up the eaves height of the remaining part of the building, but is otherwise modern in design.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nTo the east, at the site of the Hirzel House, which was destroyed in the war, there had been a cordoned-off open excavation pit for over twenty years since the mid-1990s, which was named Burgplatzloch (Burgplatz hole). It was created in 1995 during the construction of an underground parking garage for the western end of the Petersbogen structure, which was built between 1999 and 2001. The infill redevelopment did not take place despite several changes of ownership. It was only in 2017 that the construction of the building called Burgplatz Passage, which lasted until 2019, began according to the plans of the HPP architectural firm with the facade design by the Berlin architectural firm Christoph Kohl Stadtplaner Architekten CKSA. In addition to a passage to the Petersbogen, an arcade gallery, and shops and restaurants on the ground floor, it includes a hotel belonging to the NH Hotel Group on the upper floors. The facade, covered with Cotta Sandstone, contains six life-size figures with reference to the Leipzig Debate of 1519, which took place in the Pleissenburg castle opposite.\nIn 1995 an underground car park was built under the square. During the work, the foundation walls of the Pleissenburg were uncovered and examined archaeologically. The new paving reproduces the outline of the walls with darker stones.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of arcade galleries in Leipzig\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\"Burgplatz\". leipzig.de (in German).

The Lions played in the EAHL and its successor league until 1957 when it was purchased by Harry Glynne III, and Jerry DeLise. The new owners immediately rebranded the club as the 'Washington Presidents'. The franchise survived for two more years before disbanding in 1959.\n\n\n== Regular season results ==\n\n\n== Playoffs ==\nThe team made the playoffs in 1952–1953 season but lost in the first round.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Mouratoglou Tennis Academy is a tennis academy and training center in Biot, Alpes-Maritimes, France. Originally named the Bob Brett Academy, it was founded in 1996 by Patrick Mouratoglou and Bob Brett.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1996, Patrick Mouratoglou convinced veteran coach Bob Brett to start a tennis academy together in Montreuil, originally named the Bob Brett Academy.

        "content": "Kurdish mafia is a general term for organized criminal gangs that consist of ethnic Kurds. Kurdish crime groups are active worldwide, especially throughout Turkey, Europe, and sometimes in the Middle East.\n\n\n== Background ==\nKurdish organised crime has its roots in banditry before Islam. Kurdish tribes robbed foreigners who crossed through their land, and raided villages of other nations before returning to their mountains. Early Aramaic sources described how Kurds raided churches and monasteries. Many Kurds later accepted Islam, although they continued to attack foreigners, including other Muslims, who entered their land, and while Islamic states from the Rashidun to the Ottomans had rule over Kurdistan, the Kurds enjoyed levels of autonomy as the authorities were either unwilling to engage in a deeper conflict with Kurdish tribes, or failed to. The Kurds demanded travellers to pay a tax in order to bypass their land unharmed. Yaqut al-Hamawi, a renowned traveller, wrote that \"the Kurds remain in the surrounding mountains terrorizing the travellers, stealing, and looting. Intimidations, attacks, and arrests do not stop them by any means, because it is ingrained in the nature of the Kurds.\" Kurds were often associated with violence in historiography. The Kemalists in Turkey, and the Pahlavis in Iran, urbanized and sedentarized Kurds, loosening their tribal system, and putting an end to much of the violence.\n\n\n== History ==\nKurdish crime groups are operated by Kurds from all around Kurdistan, although the bulk comes from Turkish Kurdistan. Some of the crime groups carry out their activities in accordance to tribal customs. The main source of income for the Kurdish mafia is allegedly drug and weapon trafficking as well as contract killings. The Kurdish mafia also smuggles migrants into Europe in exchange for money, and are known for carrying heavy weapons. The Kurdish mafia smuggles weapons and hard drugs all across Europe, and Süleyman Soylu accused them of making over US$1.5 billion per year for the PKK. A British police report revealed that the Tottenham Boys, a Kurdish gang from London, did funnel their profits to the PKK.\nAfghanistan was a stronghold of the Kurdish mafia. Kurdish criminals smuggled opiates from Afghanistan into Iranian Kurdistan, Iraqi Kurdistan, and Syrian Kurdistan, which they would later smuggle into Turkish Kurdistan, and then transport it to Western Europe or Russia through the Balkans. In 2015, the Kurdish mafia trafficking of Afghan opiates were disrupted by the unrest in Turkish Kurdistan. Turkish police cracked down on the Kurdish mafia in the process. The Taliban supplied the Kurdish mafia with opiates in exchange for a tax, and as long as the opiates would not be sold to Kurdish civilians, but to Europeans or Russians only. The Kurdish mafia also paid the PKK a tax to pass through their territory. Despite the Taliban tolerating the opiate trade during their insurgency, they banned it in 2022, as part of their new reforms. The Kurdish mafia also patrolled the Iran–Turkey border from both sides, and smuggled Afghan migrants into Turkish cities such as Istanbul in exchange for money.\nThe Kurdish mafia is active in Sweden, heavily involved in the drug trade but also bombings, assassinations, and assaults.\nThe Albanian mafia was previously dominant in the people smuggling business, although the Kurdish mafia later took over the business, and a few years later, following the refugee crisis after the 2021 Taliban takeover, Afghan criminals dominated the business.\nIn Nashville, Tennessee, during the 1990s and 2000s, Kurdish organised criminals began operating in the city. Their main actions were drug distribution and armed burglaries. Jiyayi Suleyman, who was the first Kurdish officer of the Metro Nashville Police Department, was arrested in 2018 for assisting the gang.\nKurdish mafia gangs in Germany were also reported to extort German businessmen, making them pay a tax every month in exchange for protection, and even threatening police saying \"we outnumber you.\" German authorities had avoided targeting Kurdish mafia leaders due to fears of streets being filled with Kurdish protestors who will not allow the police to proceed. Some German municipalities even avoided arresting Kurds due to fears of a riot or retaliation.\n\n\n== Notable Kurdish mafiosi ==\nHüseyin Baybaşin\nAslan Usoyan\nRawa Majid\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Peng Meng-chi (Chinese: 彭孟緝; pinyin: Péng Mèngqī; 12 September 1908 – 19 December 1997) was a Republic of China Army officer and Republic of China diplomat. He held a position in the National Revolutionary Army and was a member of the Kuomintang. Following the retreat of the Republic of China to Taiwan, Peng served as commander of Kaohsiung Fortress in Taiwan. During and in the aftermath of the February 28 incident in 1947, he pursued a suppressive policy and ordered a massacre in Kaohsiung, earning him the nickname \"Butcher of Kaohsiung\" (高雄屠夫).\n\n\n== Early life and military career ==\nPeng was born 1908 in Hubei, China. He joined the National Revolutionary Army led by Chiang Kai-shek after graduating from the Whampoa Military Academy.\n\n\n== February 28 incident and massacre ==\n\nPeng Meng-chi was commander of Kaohsiung Fortress at the start of the February 28 incident in 1947. Chen Yi, who was chief executive of Taiwan Province, received a telegram from Chiang Kai-shek that reinforcements would arrive from Shanghai and created the \"228 Incident Settlement Committee\" to stall for time.On 6 March 1947, prior to the arrival of the troops, three prominent Kaohsiung civilians including the mayor of Kaohsiung visited Peng to present conditions of peace. They were promptly arrested and executed. Peng gave orders to move on Taiwanese protestors gathered in public places, and Peng's military forces indiscriminately killed in the streets of Kaohsiung for three days, earning him the moniker \"Butcher of Kaohsiung\" or \"Kaohsiung Butcher\" (高雄屠夫). According to report sent to the Nanking government, the assault killed 500 to 600 civilians.Meanwhile, as a battalion from the 21st Division arrived in Chiayi on 11 March, Peng sent a regiment to Chiayi the next day. The Settlement Committee asked local legislators including Tan Teng-pho, Phuan Bok-tsi (潘木枝) and Kho Lin (柯麟) to go the airport to negotiate with the Kuomintang. They were arrested upon arrival, and only the three female members of the Settlement Committee were allowed to leave. By the end of the month, Tan Teng-pho, Phuan Bok-tsi, Kho Lin were executed.\n\n\n== Later career ==\nFollowing his military career, Peng served as the ROC ambassador to Thailand from 1966 to 1969, then as ambassador to Japan from 1969 to 1972.\nAfter the Taiwanese Tainan Little League won in the 1971 Little League World Series, the team was formally received by Peng in Tokyo. Historian Andrew Morris noted the irony of a team made up of mostly southern Taiwanese children meeting with a man dubbed \"The Murderer King\" who was involved in the murderous episode in Kaohsiung.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nPeng died on 19 December 1997. In the obituary written by his son Peng Yin-kang, the civilians slaughtered by Peng's forces five decades prior were described as \"a ruthless group of violent citizens\" whom Peng had no choice but to shoot. Tu Kuang-ming, son of Tu Shih-wen who died, sued Peng's son for defamation. The high court decision stated:\n\n...this defamation suit was concerned with the historical truth of the February 28 Incident in 1947. But the Incident in the past was not allowed to talk about, and it was not until the lift of the Martial Law Decree that this Incident was openly discussed and investigations conducted. Even today, its historical facts were still not clear. Moreover, historical facts are different from legal facts. Although some new reports on the Incident have been released [which argued for Mr. Tu and against for Mr. Peng], they hardly provide any help for this court to decide on this case. This court stood in no position to decide any historical truth.\nIn 2022, prior to United States Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s highly covered visit to Taiwan, Peng Yin-kang took out a newspaper ad to express his opposition to the visit. In response Democratic Progressive Party legislator Wang Ting-yu wrote a Facebook post characterizing him as “son of the butcher in the 228 incident, helping China threaten Taiwan.” Peng sued Wang for public insult and libel; the court found Wang not guilty in the first trial, citing documents and public information that corroborate his opinion.\n\n\n=== Transitional justice initiatives ===\nIn 2017, at the 70th anniversary of the February 28 incident and subsequent March massacre, several academics as well as members of the Taiwan Statebuilding Party called for naming Chiang Kai-shek and Peng Meng-chi as main culprits of the massacre in Kaohsiung. The director of the 228 Memorial Museum Yang Chen-lung said the total death toll was absolutely more than 600 people, with many going missing. Yang's uncle was a victim in the massacre as well, and his family was too scared report his death until 16 years later.In August 2020, the Transitional Justice Commission exonerated 24 political convicts who were arrested, charged, or executed in the February 28 incident, including the three Kaohsiung residents that Peng ordered to execute.\n\n\n== References ==",

Dedicated on October 28, 1891, it honors \"those brave men of Portland, soldiers of the United States army and sailors of the navy of the United States who died in defense of the country in the late civil war\". The monument's base has the inscription Portland: To Her Sons Who Died for The Union.\nIt is a bronze statue mounted on a granite base, depicting a female figure, clad in armor and covered by flowing robes. She is holding a furled flag in one hand and a mace and shield in the other. The figure is an allegorical representation of Victory. On two sides of the base stand bronze groups of three sailors and three soldiers. On the northern side, the central figure is Brigadier Francis L. Vinton of Fort Preble. Maine sailors are honored on the opposite side, with Admiral David G. Farragut being the central figure.\nThe sculpture was created by Maine sculptor Franklin Simmons; the base was designed by New York City architect Richard Morris Hunt. Portland architect Francis H. Fassett selected the site's original landscaping. The local Grand Army of the Republic lodge raised sufficient funds for to pay for the monument. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 1, 1998.\nThe monument stands on the former location of Portland's Market House, which was built in 1825. It was modified in 1833 to become Portland's first city hall.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Big dick energy, often abbreviated BDE, is a slang phrase which originated in 2018 which denotes an easy confidence.\n\n\n== Meaning ==\nThe phrase big dick energy denotes an easy confidence or sense or assurance and purpose. In general, having big dick energy is unrelated to whether or not someone actually has a big penis or any penis at all. The term is not gender exclusive, and can be applied to women.\n\n\n== History ==\nThere are conflicting accounts of how the term originated, although both put the origin within a two-week timeframe in 2018.The term first entered popular culture after being used in 2018 on Twitter to describe Pete Davidson, then in a relationship with Ariana Grande. Replying to Grande a Twitter user tweeted that “Pete Davidson is 6’3 with dark circles, exudes big dick energy, looks evil but apparently is an angel, and loves his girl publicly,\" The phrase was immediately picked up by the community.Following the popularization of the term relating to Davidson another Twitter user took credit for coining the phrase pointing to a comment they had made two weeks beforehand mourning the death of Anthony Bourdain.In 2021 the rapper Latto released her single Big Energy which referenced the meme. Latto told Billboard that in the lyrics she took the \"masculine, trendy 'big dick energy' quote\" from social media and made it a concept that all genders can have and take it deeper than just a sexual aspect.\" Latto added, \"I wanted it to be empowering. It's an aura that you carry and a confidence. It's just an overall vibe and when you walk in the room, you have 'big energy' and no one can tell you otherwise\". Her A&R representatives first played her the beat during a studio session in Los Angeles, which she felt keen on but perceived it as musically different and \"out of [her] comfort zone\". Latto described the writing process as a dynamic collaborative effort, collecting different opinions  with \"people in the room [to] bounce ideas off of each other... talking out loud, playing the beat out loud. It wasn't a sit-down-and-write type of thing... and I was asking the girls in the room, 'What does big energy mean to you?'\n\n\n=== Small dick energy ===\n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n\nIn December 2022, Andrew Tate addressed the environmentalist Greta Thunberg in a tweet extolling his carbon-emitting automobiles and asked for her email address to give her more information. Thunberg replied with the fake, satirical email address \"smalldickenergy@getalife.com\". The exchange received substantial attention on Twitter, with Thunberg's retort quickly becoming one of the most-liked tweets ever.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Klaus Sorgenicht (24 August 1923 – 22 October 1999) was a German politician and party functionary of the Socialist Unity Party (SED).\nSorgenicht served as the longtime head of the powerful State and Legal Affairs Department at the Central Committee of the SED and was notorious for the ruthlessness with which he pursued opponents of the political system of the GDR.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nSorgenicht attended elementary school and commercial school in Hagen and Wuppertal and completed a commercial apprenticeship from 1938 to 1941. Until 1942 he was a commercial employee and department head at the company he had trained at in Wuppertal-Elberfeld.Drafted into the Wehrmacht in 1942 and trained as a driver, he was deployed in the Soviet Union since January 1943. In July 1944, he deserted and became a prisoner of war in the Soviet Union. In captivity he joined the National Committee for a Free Germany and attended an Antifa school before being deployed as an agitator at the front.\n\n\n=== East Germany ===\nHe returned to Germany in February 1945, moving with the Soviet troops. He became a member of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in July 1945 and was appointed deputy mayor of Güstrow under Hans Warnke on 6 May, rising to mayor two days later. After the local elections in 1946, Sorgenicht served as district administrator of the Güstrow district from October 1946 to the end of 1949. In 1965, he was made an honorary citizen of Güstrow.In January 1950, probably at the instigation of Warnke, now Interior Minister of Mecklenburg he was appointed head of the state, district and municipal administration in the Interior Ministry of Mecklenburg. After Warnke moved to the federal GDR Interior Ministry as State Secretary, Sorgenicht also left the Mecklenburg Interior Ministry in October 1951 to work as a main department head in the GDR Interior Ministry. In October 1952 Sorgenicht was the head of the main department for the coordination and control office for the work of the local organs of state power.\n\n\n=== SED Central Committee ===\nAfter completing a year of study at the CPSU Higher Party School, Sorgenicht became head of the State Administration Department in the fall of 1954 (reorganised as Department of State and Legal Issues in 1957) of the Central Committee of the SED, which he headed until his dismissal during the Peaceful Revolution in November 1989. Sorgenicht also joined the Volkskammer in 1958 and the State Council, the GDR's collective head of state, in 1963.This was one of the most influential departments of the Central Committee apparatus: not only was it responsible for Politburo decisions that concerned questions of the state, law, and the structure and functioning of state and judicial organs, and to control preparations and their implementation, it also headed its parallel departments in the Bezirk SED leaderships, significant parts of the Ministry of the Interior, the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Justice, the Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office and the Supreme Court. Sorgenicht was thus significantly involved in all interventions in the judiciary and in the decisions of the Politburo that governed the judiciary.He was responsible, in cooperation with the Stasi, for the systematic surveillance of judges and prosecutors. Together with Karl Polak, he initiated the fight against the remaining \"revisionists\" in the judiciary of the GDR in early 1958, namely those jurists who adhered to bourgeois or social democratic positions. This campaign culminated in the Babelsberg Conference in April of the same year. He never abandoned his mistrust of professional jurists, whose arguments differed drastically from the \"ideologically crude statements of the bureaucrat Sorgenicht.\"\nFrom 1955 to 1959, Sorgenicht completed a distance learning course at the Academy for Political Science and Law of the GDR in Potsdam, which he graduated with a degree in political science. In 1968, he received a doctorate (Dr. rer. pol.).Sorgenicht was awarded the Banner of Labor in 1965 and 1968, the Patriotic Order of Merit in 1973 and 1988, and the Order of Karl Marx in 1983.\n\n\n=== Involvement in death sentences ===\nIn his capacity as department head, he was primarily responsible for the preparation and execution of trials against political opponents, including some show trials (\"trials in extended public\").\nPrior to many trials in the 1950s and early 1960s, Klaus Sorgenicht proposed to the Politburo to impose death sentences. Once approved by the Politburo, Sorgenicht's proposals became binding for the courts, as in the trials against Gerhard Benkowitz, Heinz-Georg Ebeling and Paul Köppe, Sylvester Murau, Gottfried Strympe, Werner Flach, Karl Laurenz, and Elli Barczatis. After the death sentences were handed down against Karl Laurenz and Elli Barczatis, he recommended President Wilhelm Pieck to reject their pardon request.In the RIAS trials, Sorgenicht proposed a life sentence for Joachim Wiebach. In this case, Ulbricht went beyond Sorgenicht's proposal and ordered the death penalty.In December 1961, Sorgenicht proposed imposing the death penalty on a farmer who had resisted the forced completion of collectivization in the spring of 1960. The party held him and another farmer, who was also sentenced to death and executed, responsible for more than half of the farmers in their village who had declared their withdrawal from the Agricultural Production Cooperative in July 1961.\n\n\n=== Peaceful Revolution ===\nIn early 1989, Sorgenicht was involved in preparing the electoral fraud in the local elections on 7 May 1989.On 22 and 23 October 1989, together with Stasi head Erich Mielke, Security Affairs department head Wolfgang Herger, and Interior Minister Friedrich Dickel, he drafted a submission for the Politburo on \"Measures to prevent further formation and to push back anti-socialist movements,\" one of the last attempts by the \"old guard\" within the SED to end the demonstrations for freedom \"by all means.\" This submission is preserved in several drafts, the tone of which becomes increasingly harsh. However, the SED Politburo returned the submission to the authors for further revision.Sorgenicht resigned from the Volkskammer and the moribund State Council in late January 1990.\n\n\n=== Reunified Germany ===\nIn 1992, Sorgenicht was charged with judicial misconduct, manslaughter, and deprivation of liberty in several cases. Due to his inability to stand trial due to illness, he could no longer be held criminally accountable.\nSorgenicht passed away in 1999 at the age of 76 in Berlin.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mckenna \"Mak\" Whitham (born July 27, 2010) is an American soccer player who plays as a forward for the United States girls' national under-15 team. She is the youngest person to sign a name, image, and likeness (NIL) deal with Nike. She began training with NJ/NY Gotham FC of the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) in 2024.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nWhitham grew up homeschooled in San Francisco, California. She played club soccer for MVLA Soccer Club and then Slammers FC HB Køge of the Elite Clubs National League (ECNL). She led MVLA to the under-13 national final in July 2023, where they finished runners-up to the Slammers. She signed a name, image, and likeness contract with Nike in February 2024 at age 13, becoming the youngest athlete in any sport to sign with the company.\n\n\n== Club career ==\nWhitham was announced as a non-roster invitee for Gotham FC in the preseason on February 13, 2024. She had also trained with the Kansas City Current, the Washington Spirit and MLS Next's Los Angeles FC academy team; she signed with the semi-professional club Santa Clarita Blue Heat of United Women's Soccer (UWS) the previous month. She scored a last-minute game winner for Gotham against Deportivo Cali in a preseason tournament in Colombia on February 28, 2024, becoming the youngest person to play or score for an NWSL team. She continued training with Gotham during the 2024 season but did not publicly sign a contract with the team. Gotham general manager Yael Averbuch West said Whitham \"is clearly very ready, not just to handle this level, but to excel in our sessions\". If she signs with Gotham, the NWSL's Under-18 Entry Mechanism requires that the contract last through 2028.\n\n\n== International career ==\nAfter trying out for the national under-14 team in February 2023, Whitham was called up to the national under-15 team in October 2023.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMckenna Whitham at TopDrawerSoccer\nMckenna Whitham on Instagram",

In 1942 he enlisted in the Queen's Royal West Surrey Regiment and transferred to the Royal Artillery in July 1943.On demob he took up studies once more at the Guildhall School of Music, and his tenor style attracted him to Jani Strasser, the chief vocal coach of the Glyndebourne Operatic Company, resulting in small roles at the Glyndebourne Festival Opera for several years; he made his debut as a servant in Un ballo in maschera by Giuseppe Verdi in 1949.He was also a member of the Ambrosian Singers and the Cliff Adams Singers, appearing on Sing Something Simple for over 30 years, and chorus master at the English National Opera in the early 1980s.

Growing up in the company of her father's associates (who included such figures as Victor Hugo) she took to art, music, and literature at a young age. She played the piano and composed a set of fifteen chansons Mélodies Romantiques (1831). Alfred de Musset (1810–1857) dedicated a poem in 1843 to her and Félix Arvers (1806–1850) wrote a sonnet \"Sonnet d'Arvers\" to her in her notebook. She married Jules Mennessier at the age of 19, the couple lived in Arsenal and later Metz. In 1836 she published \"La Perce-neige\" and after the death of her father, she wrote a memoir on his life. She contributed a letter from a swallow to a canary raised in a convent as part of the illustrated parody Scènes de la vie privée et publique des animaux (1842). She lived a private life and stayed away from the literary scene from 1844 when she also took on the name Mennessier-Nodier. Jules retired in 1869 and they had four children. She died at Fontenay-aux-Roses.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Greenville Public School Complex is a historic school in Greenville, Alabama.  Butler County High School was built in 1925 as a consolidated school serving the entire county.  A second builing to house Walter O. Parmer Elementary School was completed on the same site in 1927.  In 1937–38, the Public Works Administration constructed an auditorium, cafeteria, and manual arts training building.  The high school was later renamed Greenville High School and has since relocated to a site along Interstate 65.  A new building was constructed on site, and the campus is still used for Parmer Elementary.\nThe original building is a one-story, U-shaped Colonial Revival structure with a gable roof and projecting central bay with portico and a cupola.  The 1927 structure is a two-story auditorium with one-story wings.\nThe complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Isa Melsheimer (born September 19, 1968, in Neuss) is a German sculptor, object and installation artist, painter and university lecturer.\n\n\n== Life ==\nIsa Melsheimer grew up on a vineyard in Reil on the Moselle. From 1991 to 1997, she studied painting at the Hochschule der Künste Berlin (now Berlin University of the Arts) in the Georg Baselitz master class.\nAfter a substitute semester in Björn Dahlem's class at the Bauhaus University Weimar and a guest professorship for experimental drawing at the Braunschweig University of Art, she has been Professor of Ceramics in the Fine Arts program at the Muthesisus Academy of Fine Arts in Kiel since the winter semester 2022.\nIsa Melsheimer lives and works in Berlin.\n\n\n== Work ==\nIn her artistic work, Isa Melsheimer deals with the built environment and explores the conditions for its design and adjustment. She is interested in the history of the architectural styles – especially the legacy of Modernism and the 1950s-70s examples of concrete architecture – as well as the influence of humans on nature.\nOne focus of her work is on surreal, often fragile living landscapes and improvised dwellings.\nMelsheimer's site-specific installations playfully puzzle architectural and urban spaces by mixing subjective memories, current events, symbols, and metaphors. In exhibitions, she displays spatial tension made of strings inspired by shell structures, for example.\nAnother series of works are gouaches in which architectural and design icons are quoted and, together with natural motifs (animals, plants), mutate into fantastic spaces.\nIsa Melsheimer works with simple materials such as ceramics, concrete, glass, metal, wood, but also with yarn and fabric, plants, furnishings, and everyday objects.\n\n\n== Projects ==\n2014: THE BEE TREASURE.

        "content": "Remethylation involves methylation that occurs in some biochemical cycles.  Often methyl groups are not mobile when attached to nitrogen and sulfur, but the removal and reinstallation of methyl groups does occur with the assistance of certain enzymes.\n\n\n== Homocysteine-methionine interconversion ==\n\nRemethylation is a major step in the conversion of homocysteine to the essential amino acid methionine. The remethylation process involves the enzyme methionine synthase (MS), which requires vitamin B12 as a cofactor, and also depends indirectly on folate and other B vitamins. A second pathway, which is usually restricted to liver and kidney in most mammals, involves betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) and requires trimethylglycine as a cofactor.\n\n\n== DNA processing and epigenetics ==\n\nRemethylation also has a role in epigenetics and neuroplasticity. DNA methylation patterns are largely erased and then re-established (remethylated) between generations in mammals. Almost all of the methylations from the parents are erased, first during gametogenesis, and again in early embryogenesis, with demethylation and remethylation occurring each time. Demethylation in early embryogenesis occurs in the preimplantation period in two stages – initially in the zygote, then during the first few embryonic replication cycles of morula and blastula. A wave of methylation then takes place during the implantation stage of the embryo, with CpG islands protected from methylation. This results in global repression and allows housekeeping genes to be expressed in all cells. In the post-implantation stage, methylation patterns are stage- and tissue-specific, with changes that would define each individual cell type lasting stably over a long period. \n\n\n== References ==",

She worked as a researcher for the global business magazine Fortune in New York from 1952 to 1967, when she returned to North Carolina to marry the politician Lauch Faircloth. During their marriage, her husband served as the Chairman of the North Carolina State Highway Commission and the North Carolina Secretary of Commerce.\nShe served on the board of trustees of the North Carolina Symphony and became the chairwoman in 1981. Faircloth started the Stewards Fund, a charitable foundation, which she ran until she was succeeded by her daughter in 2000. Following her death in 2010, The Anonymous Trust was created from her estate with $181 million. In 2021, the trust was worth $285 million in assets and was one of the twenty largest foundations in North Carolina.\n\n\n== Early life and family ==\nFaircloth was born Nancy Anne Bryan on October 15, 1930, in New York City to insurance executive Joseph McKinley Bryan and the heiress Kathleen Marshall Clay Price. She was the granddaughter of the insurance executive Julian Price, who developed the Jefferson Standard Life Insurance Company, and the socialite Ethel Clay Price.Her family moved to Greensboro, North Carolina in 1931, where her father took a job at her grandfather's insurance company. They lived in a mansion in the Irving Park Historic District. She attended Salem Academy, an all-girls boarding school in Winston-Salem. Faircloth graduated from Hollins College in 1952.\n\n\n== Career and philanthropy ==\nSoon after graduating from Hollins, Faircloth was hired as a researcher with the editorial staff of Fortune, a global business magazine based in New York. She worked at Fortune until 1967 when she moved back to North Carolina.She served on the board of trustees for the North Carolina Symphony but, in the 1970s, left due to a disagreement with spending policies. Faircloth rejoined the symphony's board, and took over as chairwoman, in 1981.Faircloth established the Stewards Fund, a charitable foundation that gifted over $70 million. She ran the Fund until 2000, when her daughter succeeded her. She and her siblings managed the Kathleen Price and Joseph M. Bryan Family Foundation, founded by her parents.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1967, she married the farmer and political consultant Duncan McLauchlin \"Lauch\" Faircloth in a private ceremony, officiated by Rev. Dr. John Redhead of First Presbyterian Church of Greensboro, in the garden of her family home. She was Faircloth's second wife, as he had previously been married to Lady Lynn Talton. During their marriage, her husband served as the Chairman of the North Carolina State Highway Commission and the North Carolina Secretary of Commerce. The Faircloths had one daughter, Anne, who would later become a writer for Fortune, as her mother did. Faircloth and her husband divorced in 1986.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nFaircloth died on January 15, 2010, at her home in Raleigh, North Carolina. Her funeral was held on January 23, 2010, at Alliance Medical Ministry.Following her death, The Anonymous Trust was created from her estate and was worth $181 million. The Trust, which had $285 million in assets in 2021 and ranks among North Carolina's twenty largest foundations, was created to provide financial aid for various causes in North Carolina. The trust granted $7.2 million to North Carolina State University's School of Education and $5.9 million to Fayetteville State University, as well as $15 million to other public colleges in eastern North Carolina.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Karma Artists is a producer and artist management business, established in 2012, in London, England, by Jordan Jay and Ross Gautreau. In little over a decade, it has expanded into a multi-faceted entertainment company including publishing (Karma Songs), records (Ka Records) and TV projects.\nJordan and Ross were recognised as Writer/Producer Managers of the Year at the 2021 Artist & Manager Awards, hosted by music industry bodies Music Managers Forum (MMF) and Featured Artists Coalition (FAC). It was noted: ‘Karma Artists, also celebrating their 10th anniversary, were a highly popular choice as Writer / Producer Manager’. The two were also nominated for Songwriter & Producer Management Company of the Year at the 2023 Music Business Worldwide (MBW) A&R Awards, recognised in Music Week’s 30 Under 30 longlist, and Jordan was nominated Pop/R&B A&R of the Year at MBW's 2019 A&R Awards.\n\n\n== History ==\nJordan and Ross met while working in A&R at Polydor Records (Universal Music Group). During their time there, Jordan helped form The Saturdays and The Wanted, as well as working on Girls Aloud and Sophie Ellis-Bextor, while Ross worked in an A&R Scout position at the label championing new and unsigned artists including James Bay, Jacob Banks and The 1975. Ross also held roles at ASCAP, Fairwood Music, and Epic Records (Sony). Following this, they set up Karma Artists together.\nBetween them they have consulted for The X Factor, The Voice UK, Eurovision Song Contest, Rip Tide (film), TV show ‘Project Icon’, Warner Music Group, ITV, and Fremantle, and participated on the Brit Awards Voting Academy.\nThey currently have partnerships and consulting projects with EMI, XL Talent, and Budde Music.\nAt the time of winning the Artist & Manager Awards Writer/Producer Manager of the Year category in 2021, Karma-represented creators contributed to 10 UK No.1 albums and 400 million units sold, working with artists like Charlie Puth, One Republic, David Guetta, P!nk, Take That, James Arthur, Little Mix, Olly Murs, The Script, and Katy Perry.\nOf the accolade, Annabella Coldrick, CEO, Music Managers Forum (MMF) said: “Within the industry, I don't think we’ve ever seen such a profound focus on the importance of writers and producers as we have over the past 18 months or so. The managers who represent this bedrock of talent also deserve to be recognised for their tireless investment and development, and, as they approach a major milestone anniversary I'm really pleased we can celebrate the achievements of Jordan, Ross and the entire Karma team. MMF will also continue to shine a light on the vitally important role of writer/producer managers in our upcoming Managing Expectations report.”\nJordan contributed to the 2021 Producer & Songwriter Manager Edition of the MMF's Managing Expectations report:“The MMF's Managing Expectations report raises some incredibly important recommendations that we as a company welcome wholeheartedly. For many writer/producer managers, it's incredibly frustrating how often payments for our clients are delayed for considerable time, and how simple accounting procedures are frequently not present. There's also a lack of transparency or clear information within royalty statements.\n“Ultimately, without songwriters and producers there is simply no music business. I really hope that the great work the MMF are doing is taken notice of and reform can happen so we are able to give creatives the sustainable career they deserve, as well as showing developing songwriters and producers that it is possible to make a living for themselves in the music business.”\n\n\n== Roster ==\nAs of spring 2024, the core Karma Artists (management) roster consists of:\n\nRed Triangle \nJames Reynolds\nJez Ashurst \nPhD\nBailey Hopton\nWill Reeves\nCutfather\nMike Spencer\nJimbo Barry\nJMB\nPaul O’Duffy\nKarma Songs (publishing) roster:\n\nJohan Fransson\nNick Bradley\nJez Ashurst\nAlumni: Tre Jean-Marie, and Finn Keane aka Easyfun.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Caverhill Hall is a historic, castle-like residence in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada. It is located on 134 Sydney Street, at the corner of Sydney and Macklenburg Streets. Caverhill Hall was built in 1884 for Simeon Jones, the Mayor of Saint John. Caverhill Hall was built using limestone and features a Baronial Style of architecture. It is within the boundaries of the Trinity Royal Heritage Conservation Area.\n\n\n== History ==\nCaverhill Hall was built in 1884 for Simeon Jones, who served as the Mayor of Saint John at the time. It would later be inherited by his son, Robert Keltie Jones, who offered the residence to be used to host George V and Mary of Teck during their 1901 tour, which the government accepted. Caverhill Hall became a soldier's club during the First World War, and was used as a headquarters for Military District No. 7 for a few years thereafter. In late 1922, it was placed under a five-year lease to Saint John, opening as the St. John Health Centre. After World War II, Caverhill Hall was used for over two decades as the Royal Canadian Air Force Social Club, a recreational spot for the Royal Canadian Air Force. It was also used as a nightspot, where it was called the 1880. In 2012, Caverhill Hall was sold for CA$399,900 after being a listed property for five years. The original asking price was about $800,000.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of historic places in Saint John County, New Brunswick\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "First Congregational United Church of Christ, also known as Billings First Church, is an Open and Affirming United Church of Christ (UCC) congregation in downtown Billings, Montana. Founded in 1882 as Billings' first church of any Christian denomination, the initial building was funded by Frederick Billings, for whom the city is named. First Congregational is the oldest church in the UCC's Montana–Northern Wyoming Conference and was historically known as the conference's unofficial \"cathedral church.\"\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding ===\nAmerican Home Missionary Society superintendents Delavin L. Leonard and Henry Clay Simmons visited Montana in 1882. In prior years, the Society had considered Montana too sparsely populated to justify missionary work, but access to the state was improving as the Utah and Northern Railway and Northern Pacific Railway extended their reaches. A church was established in Butte in April; the congregation would last 13 years before dissolving in 1895. In May, the Society established as second church, this one in Billings. At the time, Billings was a tent city with few permanent residents.: 15−18 : 30 To establish a Billings church, the American Home Missionary Society sent Benjamin F. Shuart, a newly ordained minister from Ohio. Shuart rode a train to Miles City, then road his horse and buggy to Coulson. Upon staying at a hotel, he was warned that he would surely starve in Billings, and he would be wise to find mission prospects beyond the mountains. Upon arriving in Billings, Shuart found a town characterized by gambling, prostitution, and heavy drinking. Undeterred, Shuart found enough congregants to formally organize Billings' first church on May 24, 1882.: 18–19 \n\n\n=== 1882–1950 ===\nFor its first two months, the fledgling congregation met at various locations, including an unfinished saloon and a bakery. Land for a building, located at the northwest corner of N. 27th Street and 3rd Avenue North, was donated by the Montana & Minnesota Land Company. The church trustees built a small frame building to serve as a temporary church, with a lean-to on the back for the pastor's residence. Railroad magnate Frederick Billings—along with his wife, Julia—donated $12,000 towards the construction of a permanent brick church on the same site. During its construction, Shuart resigned due to health issues; he remained in Billings to pursue business enterprises,: 19 : 30−31  including acting as an agent for Frederick Billings and the land company. Shuart was succeeded by A. Stryker Wallace, who would serve the church until 1891.The church building, designed by Plant & Whitney: 56  and topped by an 83-foot steeple, was dedicated on November 18, 1893. In the church's early days, intoxicated cowboys would attempt to shoot the steeple's weathervane while riding by on their horses.First Congregational was an early hub for initial Christian activity in the young city. The Methodist and Episcopal denominations began organizing in Billings in 1882, with both assembling at the Congregational church early on. (The Methodist meetings were led by William Wesley Van Orsdel, a prominent circuit rider.) The Methodists and Episcopalians would both erect their own dedicated churches in 1886. The first Roman Catholic mass in the city was held at First Congregational in 1883; St. Joaquim's Catholic Church was built in 1887.In 1916, First Congregational chartered Boy Scout Troop 2. The troop eventually became the oldest scout troop in the state, celebrating its centennial anniversary in 2016.The church added a Parish Wing, designed by McIver & Cohagen, on the north side of the building in 1927. The sanctuary was extended eastward, adding a balcony. Plans for further construction were laid aside because of the onset of the Great Depression.: 59 \n\n\n=== 1950–present ===\nWhen the church's membership swelled following World War II, an Education Wing was added to the rear of the building in 1951.: 61  Meanwhile, the congregation had long outgrown the original 1883 sanctuary. The old church was torn down in 1956 to make way for a new building designed by Orr Pickering Associates. Dedicated on November 3, 1957, this new building became known among Montana Congregationalists as the conference's de facto \"cathedral church.\": 154  Features retained from the old building included the 1889 Clinton H. Meneely bell and a stained glass window designed after a J. K. Ralston painting.In 1960, First Congregational's burgeoning membership during the midcentury period necessitated the creation of a new church on Billings' west end. The new Mayflower Congregational Church initially met at Rocky Mountain College before completing its own dedicated building in 1962.: 154  The steeple from First Congregational's former building was moved to Mayflower to serve as a belltower. It remains as one of the oldest structures in Billings.\nThe Holtkamp Organ Company built a new 30-rank pipe organ for First Congregational in 1972, replacing an earlier M. P. Moller instrument. The organ was expanded to 44 ranks in 1982. With 2,326 pipes, it is the largest pipe organ in Montana.In 1993, a brick was thrown through the window of the Schnitzer family of Billings, who had placed a menorah in their window. Montana Association of Churches executive director Margaret McDonald, a member of First Congregational, contacted minister Keith Torney with the idea of creating paper menorahs as a sign of solidarity. Members of First Congregational and other churches displayed the paper menorahs; soon after, the Billings Gazette printed a full-size menorah in its pages for readers to cut out for their own windows. This event was the impetus for the Not in Our Town project.\nAs of the 2020s, the church building is increasingly used for community initiatives and events. These include Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and the recording sessions for a Native podcast about addiction recovery, Unspoken Words. An LGBTQ+ resource center, operated by 406 Pride, is located in the church. In the winter of 2022–2023, First Congregational hosted a low-barrier shelter for community members experiencing homelessness.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nVan West, Carroll (1993). \"Searching for Stability, 1882–1883\".

        "content": "Lake Tornow (German: Tornowsee) is a lake in Ruppin Switzerland in Brandenburg, Germany. It is located east of Kunsterspring and south of Binenwalde and not far from the residential area of Tornow. It lies completely within the municipal boundaries of Neuruppin. The lake is a state waterway. It is 2.18 km (1.35 mi) wide and 1.57 km (0.98 mi) long, with an area of 124 ha (310 acres) and a maximum depth of 12 m (39 ft).\n\n\n== Interpretation of the name ==\nTornow (Tornov) is a derivation of tarn, Slavic for thorn, thorn bush, i.e. a place where thorn bushes grow. Tornow was first mentioned in 1524, and in 1541 there was a big lake near Tornow. Originally Tornow was a settlement, but after the village became an abandoned field in the Middle Ages, the Tornow forester's house stands there today. The former settlement gave the lake its name.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe lake is part of the Ruppin Switzerland nature reserve and the Ruppin Switzerland waterway in a glacial channel formed by the Kalksee Lake to the north of the Lake Tornow, the Lake Tornow itself, and to the south of it the Lake Zermützelsee, Lake Tetzensee, Lake Molchowsee, and the Rhin. The chain of lakes stretches for around 40 kilometers south to the upper part of the Rhinluch.\nLake Tornow is bordered to the north and east by the outer terminal moraine of the Frankfurt Phase with heights of about 100 m, and to the west by the associated outwash with heights of up to 60 m. The lake is sunken into its surroundings with a mirror height of about 38 m. It is connected to the Kalksee via the Binenbach, and to the Zermützelsee via the Rottstiel stream.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nThe navigable lake is the end of the water trail through the lakes of Ruppin Switzerland and can be navigated by motorboats to a limited extent. The vegetation of old beech trees and wet meadows makes the landscape attractive. There are several swimming spots and a campground at the Rottstiel stream.\nArchaeologists found traces of a fortified settlement from the Late Bronze Age on the Weilickenberg near the Bolten mill. The finds from these excavations are kept in the Potsdam Museum of Prehistory and Early History.\n\n\n== The Fontane hiking trail - a circular route around the lake ==\nThe Fontane hiking trail circles the lake for about seven kilometers. On the north shore, the Bolten mill can be visited, which was almost completely burned down in 1992. It has been rebuilt as an excursion restaurant. The trail crosses the Tornow source, the Binenbach, and the Rottstiel stream, and passes the Weilickenberg and the Zanderblick viewpoint. The village of Rottstiel and the Kunsterwiese are located along the Fontane hiking trail.\nIn some places, there are junctions to other hiking destinations such as the Kalksee Lake in the north or the Tornow Forester's Lodge in the south. A blue line marker draws attention here to the European long-distance hiking trail E 10. - After the Rottstiel bridge, the E 10 continues to the forest museum in Stendenitz and in the direction of Neuruppin.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLake Tornow with Tornow (panoramic overflight) Brandenburg Lakes: Der Tornowsee.

        "content": "\"The End\" is the series premiere of the American post-apocalyptic drama television series Fallout, based on the role-playing video game franchise created by Interplay Entertainment and now owned by Bethesda Softworks. The episode was written by series developers Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner and directed by executive producer Jonathan Nolan. It was released on Amazon Prime Video on April 10, 2024, alongside the rest of the season.\nThe series depicts the aftermath of an apocalyptic nuclear exchange in an alternate history of Earth where advances in nuclear technology after World War II led to the emergence of a retrofuturistic society and a subsequent resource war. The survivors took refuge in fallout bunkers known as Vaults, built to preserve humanity in the event of nuclear annihilation. The episode introduces Lucy, a young woman who leaves behind her home in Vault 33 to venture out into the dangerously unforgiving wasteland of a devastated Los Angeles to look for her father.\nThe series premiere received positive reviews from critics, who praised Nolan's directing, performances and production design.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nOn October 23, 2077, at a birthday party in Los Angeles, famous actor Cooper Howard entertains the children with his cowboy tricks, while the adults are distracted by news reports regarding a possible nuclear threat. As the kids go inside for cake, Howard converses with his daughter Janey over his reluctance in raising his thumb for a photograph based on his experiences as a Marine; he was taught that a mushroom cloud larger than the apparent size of one's thumb would inevitably be deadly. Suddenly a nuclear bomb hits the city, sending a shockwave towards the house. The attack causes pandemonium and the partygoers flee, with some trying to enter a fallout shelter. Howard takes his daughter and flees on horseback while more bombs hit the city, as Earth experiences a nuclear holocaust.\n219 years later, groups of humanity have been living in underground colonies known as \"Vaults\", built to preserve American society in the event of nuclear war. A young woman, Lucy MacLean, is a model Vault Dweller and the daughter of Vault 33's Overseer, Hank MacLean. Wanting to get married, she convinces a special council to grant her a wedding with a man from nearby Vault 32. After the wedding, Lucy and her new husband Monty consummate their marriage. Meanwhile, Lucy's younger brother Norm becomes suspicious of the visitors from Vault 32 and investigates the empty Vault. He discovers that Vault 32 has been destroyed and finds the mutilated corpse of a Vault Dweller. \nShortly afterwards, the \"visitors from Vault 32\" begin to murder Vault 33 residents, and on detecting high levels of radiation from her Pip-Boy, Lucy realizes the visitors are actually raiders from the surface. Monty becomes aggressive and brutally attacks Lucy, stabbing her in the abdomen. Despite her severe injury, she manages to strike him back, slicing his face and throat with broken glass. After injecting herself with a Stimpak, Lucy rushes to the main reception area to find the raiders viciously attacking the Vault. Monty ambushes her, but Hank attacks him from behind and drowns him. They run into Lee Moldaver, the leader of the raiders. Threatening Lucy's life, as well as several other Vault Dwellers, Moldaver drugs Hank and takes him to the surface. In the aftermath, Lucy resolves to find her father, and leaves Vault 33 with the help of Norm and their cousin Chet. She is astonished upon discovering the devastated remains of Los Angeles.\nOn the outskirts of Los Angeles, the Brotherhood of Steel, an organization dedicated to securing pre-War technology, trains young men in a boot camp. An aspirant, Maximus, is jealous when his friend Dane is selected to become a squire. However, Dane is forced to step aside when they are severely injured in the leg by a hidden razor blade. Maximus is suspected of having caused Dane's injury, something that he admits he considered, but the Brotherhood chooses not to punish him when he professes a willingness to accept his fate. Maximus is named as squire to Knight Titus and is assigned with his troop in pursuing a scientist from the Enclave who has escaped with dangerous technology.\nMeanwhile, three bounty hunters sneak into a cemetery where they dig up \"The Ghoul\", a still alive and heavily mutated Cooper Howard, who has been held captive for several years by a gang boss named Dom Pedro. The bounty hunters, aware of the Ghoul's reputation as a killer and tracker, request his help in finding the Enclave scientist and offer to split his bounty. The Ghoul gleefully double-crosses them, killing two and burying the third alive in his empty grave. He then departs to find the scientist himself.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nIn January 2022, Jonathan Nolan was confirmed to direct the first episode.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe score is composed by Ramin Djawadi. The episode featured many songs, including \"Orange Colored Sky\" by Nat King Cole, \"Don't Let the Stars Get in Your Eyes\" by Perry Como, \"Some Enchanted Evening\" by The Castells, \"So Doggone Lonesome\" and \"All Over Again\" by Johnny Cash, and \"Crawl Out Through The Fallout\" by Sheldon Allman.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe episode, along with the rest of the season, premiered on April 10, 2024. Originally, the season was scheduled to premiere on April 12, 2024.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\"The End\" received positive reviews from critics. William Hughes of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \"B\" grade and wrote, \"If these three chapters felt of a piece, or like they were meant to comment on each other — or even, honestly, like they came from the same TV show, period — the interpolation could have made for something special. As is, Fallout opens with one really strong episode with a couple of weaker ones jury-rigged to its frame. It's not the end of the world or anything — but a bummer, nevertheless.\"\nJack King of Vulture gave the episode a 4 star rating out of 5 and wrote, \"Splitting its time between three different protagonists is a risk for Fallout, especially given the first season is just eight episodes. You fear that one of the characters may feel short-changed. So far, so good, and it's unsurprising we spend most of our time with Lucy as the most obvious audience surrogate. In my view, nevertheless, the episode leaves the best until last.\" \nSean T. Collins of Decider wrote, \"If the Vault's environment is the work of a film projector anyway, a nice riff on Oklahoma!'s vivid Todd-AO splendor might have done the trick nicely. But while that may impact the show qualitatively, it doesn't impede its goals, which are to make a fun video-game show with a rated-R sense of humor, some gross-out stuff, and the occasional world-historical atrocity to remind us it's not always a good time. I'd say they did what they set out to do.\" Ross Bonaime of Collider wrote, \"In just an hour, Fallout's first episode does an excellent job of seeding important information through the story while still leaving plenty to the imagination, as well as introducing these three characters, each with their own unique perception of the world.\" \nJoshua Kristian McCoy of Game Rant gave the episode a 3.5 star rating out of 5 and wrote, \"\"The End\" is a solid beginning, but it clearly presages something much more enjoyable for Fallout's future.\" Greg Wheeler of The Review Geek gave the episode a 4 star rating out of 5 and wrote, \"The first episode of Fallout gets off to a decent start, with a loot  [sic] at several different characters. This actually works surprisingly well to split the focus between different people and understand more of the world and how it all slots together.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"The End\" at IMDb",

It has a capacity of 23,040.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe club was founded in 1960 under the leadership of motorcycle sports coach Volodymyr Bondarchuk and they began league speedway in 1962, as part of the inaugural Soviet Union Championship and won the silver medal during the first year of competition. During the first year of league competition, the team used the name Karpaty Lviv, from the regional toponym Karpaty (Carpathian Mountains). However the following season in 1963, the club had four teams, three of them taking on the SKA Lviv name, which was a multi purpose sports club and SKA Lviv I, won the championship of the Soviet Union. The team were prominent again from 1964 to 1966, winning bronze and silver medals respectively.The team did not compete in the league for several years and were forced to relocate to the Silmash Stadium on Sulymy St, before returning as Karpaty Lviv from 1972 to 1975 and then underwent a longer break from the league.SKA Lviv were revived in 1988, on the initiative of Serhiy Latosinsky the Ukraine national speedway team coach.\nDuring the fall of Real socialism in the Eastern Bloc countries, Lviv speedway returned to the top, winning the 1991 championship of the Soviet Union. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union the team were left in limbo due to the lack of a serious team competition in the Ukraine, although they did race in the now defunct European Speedway Club Champions' Cup in 2003 and 2009. The SKA-Speedway Lviv team joined the Team Speedway Polish Championship during the 2004 Polish speedway season but only spent the one season in 2.Liga.A team from Lviv have not raced in recent years and following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the future of the club is unknown.\n\n\n== Results ==\nChampions' Cup competition\n\n2003 - 7th place\n2009 - 6th placePolish Speedway Championship\n\n2004 - 4th in 2.Liga\n\n\n== References ==",

They were used as wine cellars to store jugs of wine and olive oil in the days of the First Temple period.\nHowever, during the Second Temple period, its cellars were used as warehouses and columbarium. During the Bar-Kokhba revolt, the cellars were used as an hiding complex from the Romans, their openings were sealed with stones and they were connected by tunnels. The site is near Horesh Yaron and Sheikh Issa. It is now called \"Givat Ha'yekavim\" inspired by the words of Rashi.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On March 21, 2024, Dexter Reed was shot and killed by officers of the Chicago Police Department (CPD) in Humboldt Park, Chicago, United States.  Reed fired his gun and injured a police officer during a traffic stop, then police returned fire, discharging over 90 rounds at Reed.\n\n\n== Incident ==\nThe shooting occurred after a traffic stop where undercover officers pulled Reed over for not wearing a seat belt. An officer told Reed to roll down the car window and asked Reed what he was doing. Reed initially rolled the car window down, but then rolled it back up, and the officer repeatedly told him not to. The officer also told Reed to unlock the car door. According to the Civilian Office of Police Accountability (COPA), Reed then shot at the officers, which resulted in the officers shooting him in return, firing 96 shots in total in the span of 41 seconds, resulting in Reed's death.\nA gun was located in the passenger's seat of Reed's vehicle, along with 11 spent bullet casings.\n\n\n== Dexter Reed ==\nReed had been shot in August 2021, and afterwards claimed to suffer PTSD, short-term memory loss, slurred speech, and blindness in one eye. In 2023, Reed was charged with possession of a firearm with a revoked FOID card, and three counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon; he was on pretrial release at the time of the shooting.\n\n\n== Response ==\nOn April 9, 2024, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said, \"Shooting a police officer can never be condoned, never excused. I will never stand for that, and neither will the city of Chicago\".\nCPD Superintendent Larry Snelling said he would not strip the involved officers of their police powers before the investigation.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "John Whorf (1903–1959) was an American realist artist who is best known for his watercolors. From his first exhibition in 1923 until the last in 1958, his work remained popular with both critics and collectors. In 1929, art historian Lloyd Goodrich said Whorf had \"inherited the mantel\" of John Singer Sargent, adding, \"Mr. Whorf, although he is still under 30, is perhaps the most brilliant watercolorist in America today, if we take 'brilliancy' to mean a breath-taking skill in depicting reality.\" A bit later, the essayist and critic Lewis Mumford wrote that Whorf's paintings \"are perhaps the finest example of current realism one can find anywhere, not excepting the water colors of Hopper.\"\nBorn in a Massachusetts North Shore town, Whorf spent his childhood summers in Provincetown and later made his home within Provincetown's art community. He received his first art training from his father, a commercial artist, and subsequently in a Boston museum school, in Provincetown's summer art sessions, and, briefly, in two Paris art academies. He traveled to Europe while still in his teens, there establishing his preference for watercolors over oils, and returned with enough work to stage his first solo exhibitions. These shows received favorable reviews from critics and resulted in many purchases by collectors. Looking back on them, a reviewer for the Christian Science Monitor later wrote that he had \"leapt into fame with no preliminaries\".\nWhorf's choice of subjects and style of painting varied little over the course of his career. He made landscapes, seascapes, and marines; cityscapes and scenes of country life; paintings of circuses, gypsies, and other genre subjects; as well as nudes and some still lifes. Recognizing this breadth of subject matter, New York Times' critic Howard Devree wrote in 1937 that \"Whorf's shore papers make feel the cold spray blown sting inland and evoke the feel of power in the serried waves rushing the land. But he has an eye for wet vistas of city streets, houses and trees by day and night with intricate play of shadows, and the hunter or angler going about his pursuits.\"\nCritics called attention to Whorf's skill as a colorist, the artistry of his compositions, his \"free and bold brushwork\", and a gift he was seen to possess to convey \"vital human interest\". They also mentioned the emotions evident in his paintings. One said they were expressive and uninhibited. Whorf himself once told an interviewer, \"To be a great artist, one must be a fanatic. Today, most of them think too much and feel too little.\": 37  In a 1934 review of Whorf's paintings, New York Times critic Edward Alden Jewell said his paintings were able to attract the viewer's attention with \"a magnet of strangeness and piquant spiritual adventure.\" He said Whorf's \"naturalism is suffused with a kind of magic that never detachedly defines an image of the thing itself, but always conjures an image that has been caught and distilled for us by the artist.\"\nIn 1959, Whorf died of heart disease while being transported by ambulance from his home in Provincetown to a hospital in Hyannis.\n\n\n== Early life and training ==\nWhorf was born and raised in a town north of Boston called Winthrop, Massachusetts. Once asked when he started painting, he said it was earlier than he could recall. Recognizing his interest, both parents supported him, and his father, a commercial artist, was his first teacher. In 1917, aged 14, he studied under a marine painter who worked in the art department his father headed, and after entering Winthrop's high school, he took part time instruction at the Museum School in Boston under the Impressionist painter Philip Leslie Hale.: 67, 209  During the summer months of 1917 and 1918, he worked under the landscape artist George Elmer Browne and the figurative painter Richard Miller. For six summers, beginning in 1917, Whorf painted with the portraitist and noted teacher Charles Webster Hawthorne, from whom he later said he gained \"an appreciation of the overwhelming beauty of light and color.\": 67  He said that among Hawthorne's assistants, John Robinson Frazier was especially helpful.: 67  In 1924, a reviewer for The Boston Globe said Whorf's paintings showed the influence of his Provincetown teachers and the artists he met there. The critic wrote: \"The whole artistic atmosphere of Provincetown influenced him and helped shape him. So that somehow you feel the characteristics of several big Provincetown personalities in his work.\"\nWhile still in high school, he spent one summer in Europe in a group led by George Elmer Browne and spent others on his own, studying briefly in Paris at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière and Académie Colarossi and extending his travels to North Africa.: 67 \n\n\n== Career in art ==\n\nWhen he was twenty, Whorf gave his first solo exhibition at a parish house in his hometown. The town's two local papers reviewed the show in depth. Their reviewers said the exhibition was a large one, attended by many people. They described the watercolors, oils, and drawings on display using such adjectives as \"promising\", \"splendid\", and \"alluring\". One called a group of Morocco paintings \"earnest work\" with \"brilliant coloring\". The Boston Globe also reviewed the show, its critic reporting that Whorf had produced \"some exceptional artistic work.\" The show generated a number of sales and resulted in commissions for two portraits. A few months after this success, the same exhibition moved to a hotel gallery in Hartford, Connecticut, and the following year, a commercial gallery in Boston gave him his first solo exhibition in a city with a large and active art scene. Held in January 1924 in the Grace Horne Gallery, this show received lengthy reviews in two local papers, The Christian Science Monitor and The Boston Globe, and a short notice in the national weekly ARTnews. The Monitor critic noted Whorf's preference for watercolors and praised \"the utter simplicity of manner in which the artist achieves sunny atmosphere. semi-transparency and luminous surfaces.\" The critic for the Globe said the show was an unusually successful one, producing record-breaking sales and declaring that \"it was apparent at once that here was a new personality in painting—as fearless in the use of color as a Russian, or a Modern, but sound in technical fundamentals.\" By the time the show ended, Whorf had sold all fifty-two paintings on display. Purchasers included some of Whorf's fellow artists, including, according to one source, John Singer Sargent.: 213 \nWhorf's paintings appeared in another solo in August 1924, this time in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and in December, Horne tested the public's enthusiasm for Whorf's work by staging a second solo in her Boston gallery. In the interim, he had again traveled abroad and also spent time in the Berkshires of western Massachusetts. Reviewing the Boston exhibition, a critic for the Boston Globe said Whorf's new work was \"even more astounding in its virility and in a certain, definite kind of distinction than that of a year ago.\" Horne continued to mount Whorf solos for the next four years, most of them drawing favorable critical attention. In reviewing the 1926 Horne exhibition, a journalist said the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston had purchased a painting, as had some of its trustees. In reviewing the 1928 exhibition, a critic said the galleries were \"thronged with excited visitors\", many of whom were eager to own one of the paintings. In 1931, a critic for the Christian Science Monitor said this last of the Boston solos \"in many respects was the most successful this brilliant pupil of Sargent has yet held.\"\nWhorf held his first solo in New York in 1926 when the Milch Galleries showed his work for the first of what would prove to be many occasions between then and the year before his death in 1959. Of the show held in 1929, Lloyd Goodrich said, \"Mr. Whorf, although he is still under 30, is perhaps the most brilliant watercolorist in America today, if we take \"brilliancy\" to mean a breath-taking skill in depicting reality.\" Regarding the Milch exhibition of 1930, a writer for Art Digest wrote that many reviewers of Whorf's watercolors considered him a successor to John Singer Sargent. In reviewing the previous year's show, Goodrich had made this thought explicit, saying, \"The mantle of John Singer Sargent has certainly fallen upon Mr. Whorf; he already has as much sheer ability of hand and eye, as great a power of making his brush catch the illusive effects of reality with a minimum of apparent effort. Reviewing the 1934 Milch show, Edward Alden Jewell wrote in the New York Times that he showed \"amazing ingenuity rooted in knowledge. In 1943, Jewell's colleague Howard Devree saw a \"freshness and breadth of vision\" in Whorf's paintings at Milch and two years later credited him with \"consummate sureness\" in that year's show.\nIn 1927, organizers of the Seventh Annual Invitational Exhibition of Watercolors at the Art Institute of Chicago gave Whorf a gallery to himself in which he showed twenty-two paintings. In discussing the invitation, the museum's monthly bulletin listed the gallery as if it were a solo exhibition.\" When he was invited again the following year, the museum awarded Whorf its Logan Gold Medal for a painting called \"Bathers\". Without naming them, one critic noted \"certain technical considerations\" in 1924. Another said his use of varnish to enhance contrast was \"a doubtful expedient\". In 1929, he was said to have overcome \"certain blind spots\" apparent in earlier work. One saw a lack of \"inner warmth\" in his work, though less so than in Sargent's. In 1930, he was seen as less able than other artists to \"enkindle the quiescent imagination of his audience\".\nIn 1938, at the height of the social realist movement in art, his work was said to lack \"contemporary significance\". In the post-war years, as abstract expressionism began to gain traction, Howard Devree wrote: \"The sternness of advanced taste may object to [Whorf's] prettification of what he sees, but there is no denying his skill nor the sense of serenity that his work exudes.\" In the year before Whorf's death, Stuart Preston placed him within a group of realist painters who were able to succeed despite the influence of what he called the \"advance guard\". He wrote: \"The tradition of visual facts and their embellishment is too strong in American aesthetics to be uprooted. As in the past, John Whorf's watercolors, a new selection of which is at the Milch Galleries, 21 East Sixty-seventh Street, reveal him as a master illustrator.\" He said the paintings were almost too straightforwardly realistic, lacking \"a sense of personal style that no manual dexterity can ever quite replace.\"\n\n\n=== Artistic technique and style ===\nWhorf was a realist painter in the American Impressionist tradition. In 1951, a critic said Whorf conceived the process of painting \"as an act of absolute fidelity\" to his subjects. He was also a colorist. In his watercolors, he used a \"free and bold\" technique according to one observer, and tended to use a full brush to insure purity and clarity of color. He complemented opaque color areas with fluent use of washes. He was also said to control his wet color well, in order to take effective advantage of \"inevitable accidentals\" and cannily use white paper for highlights.\nIn 1926, an unnamed critic described aspects of Whorf's realist style as follows:\n\nHe is an impressionist–as are most moderns–and yet there is nothing vague, nothing hesitating, nothing left indistinct through fear of the inability to render it truthfully. He likes to paint sunlight, warmth and glow, yet seldom resorts to a high key for his effects. As a draughtsman he has mastered perspective, and shades and shadows, yet he wisely subordinates these things to the more important function of composition. He gets his impressions and makes his notes direct from nature. He paints, however, in his studio—away from all the actual form and color—working mostly from memory, because he feels that too close an application to any model results in confusion.\nHe was credited with \"an amazing breadth of artistic sympathies\". He painted in New England, Western Europe, and North Africa. He painted landscapes, cityscapes, seascapes, and marines. He made hunting and fishing scenes; circus and ballet scenes. He painted nudes. He painted both at home and abroad. Image No. 1 shows an early seascape. No. 1 shows his treatment of a scene in Venice, a locale that attracted other well-known watercolorists. No. 3 shows one of nudes. This painting won an award when shown at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1928. No. 4 is an early mid-career shore scene. No. 5 shows a Spanish theme. No. 6 is a cityscape that shows his handling of wet weather. No. 7 shows his interest in depicting men struggling against the elements. No. 8 is a winter hunting scene. No. 9 is an urban winter scene. No. 10 shows a relatively abstract winter scene. No. 11 shows his interest in ballet.\nHe explained his preference for watercolor by saying he \"could not get the same rapidity of color in an oil,\" Remembering his first trip to Europe, he wrote: \"Strange how it happened. I was living in Paris at that time and had decided to go down to Pamplona, Spain, for the bullfights. Instead of lugging around oils, I decided to take watercolors along because they were lighter and easy to carry. And ever since then, it's been watercolors.\": 210 \nWhorf also once wrote that of the old masters he most admired Valasquez and Rembrandt and of modern artists Whistler, Renoir, Degas, Monet, Manet, Sargent, and Homer.: 67  Critics compared him to other watercolorists, including Dodge MacKnight as well as Sargent and Homer, but he was seen to have his own unique style. As one critic said, \"Mr. Whorf is not an imitator. He does not produce pseudo-Sargents. But he has with original energy carried over into his work something of the master's directness and spontaneity.\" Another wrote of his watercolors: \"No matter where he paints there is always that John Whorf something in them that is unmistakable. The personal equation is strong in them.\"\nWhorf painted in a studio, often just an unused room in his house.: 69  He was prolific, regularly producing enough new work to fill his annual solos and other exhibitions, and had, as one critic said, \"a bold assurance in his chosen medium.\" On one occasion, his paintings were said to reveal an \"emotional and uninhibited\" temperament. In 1928, a critic said his style was daring but did not diverge from the norm; he was not a stylistic innovator, but distinguished himself by painting with great intensity. Late in his career, a critic said his style was an easily recognizable one that changed little over time.\nIn 1924, the critic, A.J.Philpott, addressed the individuality in Whorf's style:\n\nNo matter where he paints there is always that John Whorf something in [his paintings] that is unmistakable. The personal equation is strong in them. In most of his pictures there are vivid and dramatic color contrasts. He loves blues, yellows and reds and vivid greens. He loves sunshine. He conveys the idea of sunshine with a simple palette. He uses his watercolors pure and without medium, other than the water to flow the color... His compositions are always well balanced in line and color—even his sketches. But essentially he is a colorist. Yet that doesn't tell the whole story. If it did he wouldn't amount to much in the long run. There was sentiment in many of these pictures—they touched the imagination in other than a color sense. He thinks as well as feels his picture. The scene ls as he feels it.\n\n\n== Personal life and family ==\nWhorf was born on January 10, 1903, in Winthrop, Massachusetts. His father, Harry Church Whorf (1874–1934), was head of the art department at a Boston printing firm called Oxford Press.: 67  His mother was Sarah Edna Lee Whorf (1844–1922). His siblings were Benjamin Atwood Lee Whorf (1897–1941), Julia Stewart Whorf (1899–1904), and Richard Baker Whorf (1906–1966). Julia died young of pneumonia. Benjamin grew up to become a highly regarded linguist, and Richard became an actor, writer, and film director. The two brothers, like Whorf himself, benefited from their parents' \"great intellectual curiosity\" (as one source put it), that they encouraged in their sons.\nIn 1925, Whorf married a high school classmate, Vivienne Isabelle Wing (1903–1972). They had four children: Carol (1926–2008)), John (b.1927), Nancy (1930–2009), and Michael (1932–2020)). Carol and Nancy grew up to become artists, Carol painting under her married name, Carol Whorf Wescott, and Nancy using her family name. Michael became a radio personality and John a commercial artist and craftsman.\nThe family's first home was in Brookline, Massachusetts. In 1934, they moved to Provincetown where they remained for the rest of Whorf's life.\nWhorf was friendly and outgoing. He spent long hours conversing with the artists, fishermen, and other residents of Provincetown and valued his role as one of Provincetown's Beachcombers, a club begun by artists that later grew to include writers and other creative professionals.: 68  Nonetheless, he did not like giving interviews and was described by his son Michael as a private person.: 200 \nDuring his adult life, Whorf walked with a limp and used a cane. His son Michael said family members used the euphemism \"lame\" to refer to his disability and variously ascribed the cause as the result of a childhood fall or one of two diseases, poliomyelitis or transverse myelitis.: 32  No source that is readily available online gives evidence for any of these three possible causes. One source says he was seventeen and another that he was eighteen when the event occurred.\nA reporter described him at the age of twenty-one. He was then somewhat thin and tall, looking \"something like a Spaniard\". This source also said Whorf was modest and good-natured. A woman who met him when he was working in Provincetown said that in his mid-forties he had a \"beautiful head\" and was known to swear \"like a trooper\" and \"drink like a fish\". In 1931, a reporter said he used a boat he owned to cruise up and down the coast to little fishing communities.\nOn February 13, 1959, Whorf died of heart disease while being transported by ambulance from his home in Provincetown to a hospital in Hyannis.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBohemian by the Sea by Michael Whorf (2016, published by Xlibris for the author)\nJohn Whorf, NA, AWS, 1903-1959: rediscovered by John Whorf and Amy Whorf McGuiggan (2013, AFA Publishing)",

        "content": "José Remedios Rodrigues (born Joseph Constancio Rodrigues; 18 January 1963), known professionally as Jose Rod, is an Indian singer, composer, actor, director, playwright, and former footballer known for his work in khell tiatr and tiatr productions.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJosé Remedios Rodrigues, originally baptized as Joseph Constancio Rodrigues, was born on 18 January 1963, in Curchorem, Goa. Curchorem was a part of Portuguese India under the Portuguese Empire at that time. His parents were Constancio Anselmo Rodrigues, who hailed from Queula, and Maria Santana Rodrigues. Rodrigues was the second child among four siblings, with an elder sister and two younger sisters. He grew up in the village of Sanvordem. Rodrigues completed his Secondary School Certificate (SSC) from Guardian Angel High School in Sanvordem. He pursued his undergraduate studies at Parvatibai Chowgule College in Gogol, Goa, and later obtained a postgraduate degree in Banking from Bombay University. Soon after completing his higher education, he decided to immigrate to Kuwait.\n\n\n== Career ==\nRodrigues made his debut in the tiatr industry at the age of 5, under the tutelage of Mike Mehta, a tiatr figure in the theatre field. His initial debut occurred in the theatrical production known as Nitik Sampoddlo, staged by Albert Carvalho from Sanvordem. This particular production garnered attention due to its professional cast, including performers like M. Boyer, Remmie Colaço, and Jacinto Vaz. Nitik Sampoddlo achieved popularity and was performed across various venues in Goa. In that historical period, non-stop shows were a widely popular entertainment format in Goa. These shows typically featured sets of 10-12 songs, each structured with a verse and chorus. The songs were intricately woven into the narrative of the play. Rodrigues showcased his talent not only as an actor but also as a singer in these non-stop shows. His dad's cousin, Mike Mehta, played a pivotal role in introducing Rodrigues to the tiatr scene, casting him in productions such as Papagai Canta e Bera (Parrot sings and bellows), Sunita, and Rogot Goykaranchem (Goan Blood). Rodrigues's abilities caught the attention of Anthony San, another popular figure in the tiatr industry. He was given the opportunity to participate in the non-stop show Darvontto, where he demonstrated his versatility as both an artist and a singer. Rodrigues assumed the role of composing songs for this production, imbuing them with his expertise and delivering performances on stage.\nPrince Jacob, another popular director, recognized Rodrigues's talent and offered him a prominent role in his non-stop show Pinzrem (Cage). Despite his young age of 20, Rodrigues portrayed the character of a villainous 70-year-old man convincingly. He continued to excel in villainous roles in subsequent non-stop shows directed by Prince Jacob, including Kagot (Paper) and Painnem. Following his successful collaborations with Prince Jacob, Rodrigues was approached by Roseferns to participate in three of his productions: Dovo Kavllo (White Crow), Girann, and Jem Tujem Tem Mhojem (What's yours, so is mine). These opportunities allowed Rodrigues to further refine his skills and gain experience on the tiatr stage. With his growing understanding of the nuances of tiatr and his accumulated stage experience, Rodrigues decided to embark on a creative venture alongside Anthony San. Together, they co-wrote and produced two tiatrs, namely Bhiradd and Punn Kiteak? (But Why?). These productions served as platforms for Rodrigues to explore new artistic directions and experiment with his creative abilities, further establishing his presence in the tiatr industry.\nFollowing his experience in tiatrs, Rodrigues embarked on a solo career as a writer and director. His theatrical presentation known as Mauli (Spider) reached a significant achievement by successfully concluding 2,018 performances in Goa, establishing a new record for the fastest century of non-stop shows in history. Expanding his creative endeavors, Rodrigues ventured into the music industry with the release of his debut album, Noman, in 2005. The album featured a collection of twelve solo songs, all performed by Rodrigues himself. Despite its experimental nature, Noman garnered favorable reception from listeners. Rodrigues further explored his musical talents by releasing additional audio cassettes and CDs. When crafting his songs, Rodrigues meticulously gauges the pulse of his audience, incorporating elements such as familial narratives and love songs to create a comprehensive and commercially viable musical package. As a tiatrist, Rodrigues has encountered various challenges throughout his career. During a particular occasion, on his way to the first showing of his stage play Bhiradd in Panjim at 6:30 pm, Rodrigues was informed that his main actor, Mike Mehta, had been in an accident and was being treated in the intensive care unit. Mehta portrayed a wealthy character in Bhiradd, while Rodrigues himself was slated to depict a beggar. Within the same tiatr production, Rodrigues was tasked with delivering comedic performances, while the absence of Comedian Philip at the Mapusa show presented a challenge. Communication with fellow artists during that era, when mobile phones were not yet ubiquitous, proved to be a complex endeavor. Rodrigues adeptly assumed the roles of comedian, villain, and hero, effectively showcasing his artistic versatility.\nRodrigues as a versatile artist was known for his talents in acting and singing. He has also left a mark on the realm of football. He represented Goa (U-19) in the sport and even played for the senior division of the Goa football team. Despite his prowess on the football field, Rodrigues' true liking lies in the world of tiatr, a form of theatrical performance. Such is his dedication to tiatr that he declined a job offer from a football club, opting to pursue his theatrical career instead. In 2009, Rodrigues faced a significant health challenge that necessitated surgery. This led to a substantial break from his artistic pursuits as he focused on receiving medical treatment and making a full recovery. However, as of 2020, Rodrigues has emerged from this hiatus and embarked on a new creative endeavor. Currently, he is in the process of recording a new album, the details of which he prefers to keep under wraps. Rodrigues guarantees that the forthcoming album will be characterized by its uniqueness and innovative approach, boasting a diverse range of songs featuring popular vocalists.\nWhen it comes to songwriting, Rodrigues gravitates towards themes connected to family, including heartfelt love songs. He takes pride in the warm reception his compositions and performances have received from audiences, and he envisions a similar level of support in the near future. Additionally, Rodrigues nurtures a dream of returning to the stage with a compelling drama production. This undertaking holds a special purpose for him, as he intends to express his deep gratitude to the audience and fans who supported him through their fervent prayers during his challenging period. Rodrigues has made contributions to the music scene. His vocals can be heard in several songs, and he has released a total of nine Konkani audio albums. Among his works are Menin Jezu, Angounn, Tarvotti, Adeus, Suskar, Sopnam, Govai, Teag, and Noman. The album titled Noman showcased Rodrigues singular artistry, with all songs composed and performed solely by him.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nRodrigues has a professional certification as a specialist in documentary credits. He has familial connections to London, United Kingdom, where his two sisters reside. Rodrigues has established a production company named Reka Productions, which serves as a tribute to his late youngest sister, Reka. On 5 May 1993, Rodrigues underwent a civil marriage registration with Judy Philomena Mendes, a resident of Bombay and the daughter of Konkani singers Antonette Mendes and Romeo Mendes at Quepem. Subsequently, their wedding ceremony took place on 6 June of the same year at Guardian Angel Church in Sanvordem. As of 1993, Rodrigues lived in Cariamoddi, Curchorem. The couple has a son named Jrosky, who currently works as an investment banker in Kuwait, and a daughter named Juricle, who has obtained certification from the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) and is employed by Amazon, based in Bangalore.\nIn 1994, Rodrigues made the decision to immigrate to Kuwait, where he embarked on a career in banking at Burgan Bank. On 12 March 2012, Rodrigues's father died at the age of 69 in his residence located in Curchorem, Goa. In 2009, Rodrigues underwent a surgical procedure to address a brain tumor that had been diagnosed. Despite the passage of time, he continues to face health challenges, necessitating ongoing medical treatment. When questioned about his perspective on tiatrists utilizing YouTube as a platform to showcase their artistic endeavors, Rodrigues expressed a favorable stance, emphasizing that tiatrists will be valued by enthusiasts regardless of the specific platform employed. Furthermore, Rodrigues is known for his devout Catholic faith. As of 2022, he resides in Goa, where he is said to be recovering from his illness.\n\n\n== References ==",

However, due to a dispute with the government, the new council was never convened.\n\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing two elections in 1938 and a dispute between Sheikh Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah and the elected Legislative Council, the sheikh dissolved the council in March 1939 and replaced it with a fully-appointed advisory council. However, the council ceased meeting in July 1940 after an investigation into the treasury's accounts.\nIn 1954 a petition was circulated calling for an elected council. Four years later Sheikh Abdullah Al-Salim Al-Sabah, who had been involved in the creation of the original Legislative Council, held elections for a new advisory council.\n\n\n== Results ==\nSeveral of those elected had been elected to the previous Legislative Council in 1938, including Abdul Latif Mohammed Thunayan Al-Ghanim, Mishaan Khudair Mishaan Khudair, Nisf Youssef Al-Nisf, Youssef Abdul Wahab Al-Adsani and Youssef Saleh Al-Humaidhi.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nFollowing the elections, the government demanded that three of the elected members resign from their posts. As a result, the newly elected council never met. The sheikh appointed members to a new Supreme Council the following year and in 1961 elections to a constitutional convention were held.\n\n\n== References ==",

One-third of the 78 members of Newcastle City Council in Tyne and Wear will be elected, alongside a vacancy in Fawdon and West Gosforth ward.\n\n\n== Background ==\nNewcastle is a strong council for the Labour Party. Labour controlled the council from its creation in 1973 until 2004, when the Liberal Democrats won a majority on the council. Labour retook control in 2011, and have maintained a majority at every subsequent election. In the previous election, Labour won 14 seats (down 3) with 41.9% of the vote, Liberal Democrats won 10 (up 2) with 27.8%, Newcastle Independents won 2 (up 1) with 4.7%, and independents won 1 with 4.2%.\nThe seats up for election in 2024 were last contested in 2021; because of the delay of all local elections due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the seats are up for election after 3 years rather than the usual 4. In that election, Labour won 18 seats (down 2) with 39.2%, Liberal Democrats won 6 with 19.5%, independents won 2 with 7.0%, and Newcastle Independents won 2 (up 2) with 6.8%.\n\n\n== Previous council composition ==\n\nChanges:\n\nNovember 2023: Jason Smith (Newcastle Independents) resigns; seat left vacant until 2024 election\nJanuary 2024: Habib Rahman leaves Labour to sit as an independent\nMarch 2024: Brenda Hindmarsh (Liberal Democrats) resigns; seat left vacant until 2024 election\n\n\n== Election result ==\n\n\n== Candidates ==\nThe Statement of Persons Nominated, which details the candidates standing in each ward, was released by Newcastle City Council following the close of nominations on 5 April 2024.

        "content": "Batestein Castle (Dutch: Kasteel Batestein) was a princely residence in Vianen in the Dutch province of Utrecht (since 2002), and South Holland (before 2002). It was the main seat of the Van Brederode family. The castle was famous for its gardens and its sculptures. It has been demolished in the 19th century. Today, not much remains except a gate from the 17th century, a pump and some parts of the walls. A local foundation is working on a partial reconstruction of the gardens.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== ‘Kasteel op de Bol’ ===\nThe first lords of Vianen came from the family of Beusichem. They were officials of the bishop of Utrecht. They lived in the castle on the Bol (Dutch: Kasteel op de Bol), located 350 meters south of the old town of Vianen. It consisted of an irregular octagon of about thirty meters in diameter. It was surrounded by a moat and had a tower on the southwest corner.\nToday, there is nothing left to see of the castle on the Bol. However, excavations were carried out between 1969 and 1971, during which remains were uncovered.\n\n\n=== Gijsbrecht van Vianen ===\nGijsbrecht van Vianen left the castle on the Bol. Around 1370, he commissioned the construction of castle Batestein on the northwest tip of Vianen. Gijsbrecht was married to Beatrix van Egmond, also known as Beate or Bate. Possibly, the name Batestein is derived from her name.\nThe castle was dominated by a large keep, also called the tower of Saint Pol. Gijsbrecht had captured the count of Saint Pol during the Battle of Baesweiler in 1371 and imprisoned him in the castle. The ransom Gijsbrecht received from the count financed the construction of the tower, and as thanks, it was named after the count.\n\n\n=== Entrance of the Brederodes ===\nIn 1414, the castle came into the possession of Walraven I van Brederode (1370–1417) through marriage to Gijsbrecht's granddaughter, Johanna van Vianen. The Van Brederode family were among the most important nobles in the Netherlands. They held high military and political positions, serving as advisors and commanders, and holding titles such as the viscountship of Utrecht and count of Brederode. The ancestral seat of the family was Castle Brederode near Haarlem.\nUnder Hendrick van Brederode (1531–1568), the castle experienced its greatest splendour. The castle grew into an extensive complex, with several wings surrounding the castle tower. A beautiful renaissance garden was also laid out.\nBatestein gained significant political importance when the Geuzen gathered here to prepare and draft the Compromise of Nobles in 1566, which Hendrik offered to Margaret of Parma (1522–1586), the Governor of the Netherlands. In 1567, Vianen fell into Spanish hands; the city was dismantled, and the goods of Van Brederode were confiscated. After the Eighty Years' War, the castle returned to the hands of the Van Brederodes, who had fought on the side of the States.\n\n\n=== 17th Century ===\nJohan Wolfert van Brederode (1599–1655) revived the castle. He was a field marshal in the State army and had good relations with the court of the princes of Orange. In 1619, he married Anne Joanne of Nassau-Siegen (1594–1636). Around 1630 to 1650, he had the castle embellished into a modern residence. The castle was beautifully furnished and the walls were papered with tapestries and gold wallpaper. The couple received many guests in Vianen, including prince Frederick Henry and his wife countess Amalia of Solms-Braunfels, the counts of Nassau and Solms, the viscount Dohna and members of the States of Holland, who were received royally.\nDuring this construction period, the Hofpoort (Court Gate) was also built. The gate formed a decorative part of the castle connecting it to the gardens, which were expanded and designed at the same time under the supervision of gardener Isaac Leveschin. The gardens of Prince Maurice and Prince Frederick Henry in and around The Hague, near the Buitenhof and Honselaarsdijk, served as an example for the gardens.\nWith Wolfert van Brederode (1649–1679), the Brederode lineage died out. Initially, the property went to the von Dohna family, but in 1687, it was inherited by Simon Henry, Count of Lippe (1649–1697), who was married to Amalia of Dohna-Vianen.\nOn the night of September 11 to 12, 1696, a clerk set off fireworks in the courtyard of the castle. One or more rockets flew through an open window. In a short time, the castle was engulfed in flames. Only the most important documents could be saved; much of the castle was destroyed. Although there was a desire to rebuild the castle, this did not happen due to lack of funds. The heavy financial burdens persisted, and in 1725, Simon Henry Adolph, Count of Lippe-Detmold (1694–1734) sold Batestein Castle and the lordship of Vianen to the States of Holland and West Friesland. The count had the furnishings sent to his castle in Detmold, including around sixty paintings.\n\n\n=== 18th century till Today ===\nDuring the 18th century, the castle served various purposes, including as a barracks and military hospital. The Saint-Pol tower was demolished in 1771. The 19th century brought its end. The demolition of what remained of the castle began shortly after 1828. Today, only a few remnants remain, such as the Hofpoort from around 1650 and a pump from 1648 on the Hofplein.\nThe rich interior and furnishings, including tapestries and paintings (an inventory from 1685 listed 250 paintings), have been dispersed and lost over time. The princes of Dohna had collected their heirlooms in a Brederode room, which existed in Schlobitten Castle until its destruction in 1945. Furthermore, some paintings from Batestein can still be found in Braunfels castle, home of the Solms-Braunfels family.\nA local foundation called Hof van Brederode Vianen is working to restore a portion of the castle gardens. The municipality made the land available for this purpose in 2019. The foundation aims to make an accurate reconstruction based on historical imagery and archaeological and cadastral sources.\n\n\n=== Amaliastein ===\nAround 1560, Hendrick van Brederode had a country estate built for his wife Amalia of Neuenahr (1539–1602), west of Vianen: Amaliastein. In the 17th century, significant gardens were established here under Johan Wolfert van Brederode. The estate was demolished around 1830. What remains today are a sundial, part of the forest, and the moated grounds. Additionally, there are maps and drawings from the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nde Meyere, J.A.L.; Ruijter, J.M.M. (1981).

        "content": "Fakhr al-Din Hindushah Nakhjavani (Persian: هندوشاه نخجوانی, romanized: Hindūšāh Naḫjawāni) or Nakhjivani (c. 1240 - c. 1328) was a medieval Iranian scholar, poet and historian of most possibly Turkic ethnicity.\n\n\n== Life ==\nHis full name was Hindushah b. Sanjar b. Abdallah al-Ṣāḥebi al-Kirani. According to Clifford Edmund Bosworth, the nisba Sahebi meant that he was connected to a powerful political figure of his time - Shams al-Din Juwayni.\nHe was born in Kiran (near modern Kələntər Dizə, Nakhchivan). His father's name - Badr al-Din Sanjar - suggests that he was of Turkic parentage, who probably served Eldiguzids. Before 1275, he was a student in Mustansiriya Madrasah, studying ophtalmology, Arabic grammar and hadith under teachers like Shams al-Dīn Muḥammad Kīshī (d. 1294) and Abu al-Qasim Kashani. In 1275, he was appointed to Kashan, where his brother emir Sayf al-Dawla Mahmud (d. before 1258) was governor.\nHe also copied various manuscripts from other authors. He seems to have travelled to Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad in 1280 and started teaching there. Meanwhile, he copied Najm al-Din al-Qazwini al-Katibi's Jāmi al-daqā’iq fi kašf al-haqā’iq (collection of Subtleties in Unveiling the Realities) there in 1284/5 and traveled to Nakhchivan's Sahibiyya Madrasah where he copied Abu al-Qasim al-Shatibi and al-Dani's works in 1294/5. He worked on anthology of Arabic poetry called Mawarid al-adab composed in Tabriz on 30 April 1308, with his own additional 45 verses. Sometime later he went to Luristan and presented his work Tajāreb al-salaf, a Persian translation of Ibn al-Tiqtaqa's Kitab al-Fakhri with his own additions to atabeg Nusrat al-Din Ahmad in April–May 1314. Next year, he went to Shushtar where he copied several authors' works including Yaqut al-Hamawi, Mansur ibn Fallah Yamani, 'Ali ibn al-'Abbas al-Majusi and others. He returned to Azerbaijan in 1317, living and working in Baylaqan, Sultaniyeh, Sohrevard and Nakhchivan again in 1321.\nHindushah was credited by Kâtip Çelebi with authorship of a Turkish-Persian lexicon Ṣiḥāḥ al-ʻājam, which became a matter of debate among scholars. While scholars like O.F.Akimushkin who dated the work to 8 May 1279 and Gulam Huseyn Bigdali who published an edition of this book supported Hindushah's authorship, Charles Ambrose Storey, Muhit Tabataba’i and others doubted it. Azerbaijani orientalists Jamila Sadigova and Tayyiba Alasgarova in their joint critical edition criticized Bigdali's poor work, while supporting his claim that Hindushah was indeed the author. David Durand-Guédy refuted authorship claims, however agreed that Hindushah, being a Turk most probably spoke Turkic language besides Persian and Arabic, but was also interested in Adhari language.\nHe has often mixed with his son, more famous Muhammad Nakhjavani. He died before 1328 according to a mention in his son's work.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nBosworth, C.E (2003). \"Hendušāh b. Sanjar\". In Yarshater, Ehsan (ed.).

She was the first woman to represent her constituency and she was the only woman in the cabinet when she became the minister responsible for Disaster Preparedness, Management and Reconstruction.\n\n\n== Life ==\nParker-Edgecombe was born in West End, Grand Bahama. Her mother was single and she was cared for by her mother and her grandmother. Her first work was to save money for her education which resulted not only in an honours degree in Mass Communications/Broadcast Journalism, but also a master's degree in Public Administration. Her qualifications led to a fifteen-year-long journalism career in the Broadcasting Corporation of the Bahamas. Her career included being an anchor on the news.\nShe was elected to parliament in the Bahamas’ General Election of 2017. She was the first woman to represent West Grand Bahama and Bimini.\nParker-Edgecombe became a Parliamentary Secretary in the Office of the Prime Minister. On 2 March 2021 she was promoted to be a Minister of State. She was made responsible for Disaster Preparedness, Management and Reconstruction on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. She replaced Iram Lewis who was given another ministerial portfilio. Lanisha Rolle had resigned the week before and she had been the only woman in the cabinet. It was alleged that Parker-Edgecombe had been chosen to be a minister because she was a woman. Parker-Edgecombe said this was just politics and she regretted that she was the only woman in cabinet, but there were others in the parliament.\nIn October 2023 she was not chosen as her party's candidate for what had been her constituency for one term. She had her position to Obie Wilchcombe and her party had chosen Bishop Ricardo Grant as their new candidate. She supported Bishop Ricardo Grant and said she was not disappointed.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Siege of Lisbon was a military campaign and siege at the city of Lisbon. The Norwegian Realm fought the Iberian Muslims at the city in 1109. The Norwegians eventually won, and suffered very low casualties. The siege in particular had impact on Lisbon because of the ongoing Christian and Muslim conflicts in the Iberian peninsula.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1109 a Norwegian fleet of 60 ships entered Lisbon through the Tagus river under the command of Sigurd I of Norway. There they would eventually siege the city and hand it over to the Christian Kingdom of León through their vassal and Henry, Count of Portugal.\n\n\n== The siege ==\nAlthough much of the actual siege is unknown it is described as a vast and bloody battle around and inside the city of Lisbon. The walls being broken by catapults, and the Norwegian army suffering low casualities and losses. The Norwegian army with Sigurd the Crusader at the head of it plundered and seized the city successfully. The siege and raid on the Muslim city is often refered to as Sigurds third victory during his crusade. And is often recognised to have a major impact on the Reconquista.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nIt is unknown how much Sigurds siege contributed to the Reconquista, although much suggests an impact, with even scholars refering to the norse raids of Iberia and the Balearic islands as part of a larger history of Islamic Iberia.\nSome of the men that were captured in the siege were baptized afterwars. The king took what he could carry before leaving the city to continue the Crusade. He would later go on to attack the Barbary pirates of Majorca before continuing the journey to Sicily.\nShortly after the siege, the city was handed over to the Kingdom of León through Henry, Count of Portugal. Evidence point to there being some sort of agreement between Sigurd and Count Henry of Portugal however there are no direct record of the alliance.  Even with the coincidence of events, since Henry captured Sintra at least once in 1109. This suggests coordination between the two leaders, though it should not be ruled out that this might be pure luck.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAðalbjarnarson, Bjarni (1951).

        "content": "Triple Play is an album by the American musician Lucky Peterson, released in 1990. It was his second and final album for Alligator Records. Peterson supported the album with a North American tour.\n\n\n== Production ==\nRecorded at Kingsnake Studios, in Sanford, Florida, the album was produced by Bob Greenlee. Peterson sang and played guitar and keyboards; he wrote or cowrote nine of the album's songs. He was backed by the studio's house band. Like many blues musicians of the period, Peterson was influenced by Robert Cray, although he tried to incorporate more of a jazz influence. \"I Found a Love\" is a cover of the Wilson Pickett song. \"Funky Ray\" highlights the trombone playing of Ray Anderson.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe Sun-Sentinel wrote that, \"with a vision and lyrical outpouring that belies his youth, Peterson scopes the usual blues turf: romance, broken hearts and tough times, in an unusually upbeat, danceable manner.\" The Kingston Whig-Standard said that Peterson \"operates in the same style as Robert Cray, although his voice is a little rougher and gruffer.\" The Commercial Appeal stated that Peterson \"makes modern blues numbers, liberally sprinkling funk, pop and rock.\"\nThe Buffalo News concluded that, \"despite his instrumental prowess, he still needs a distinct identity.\" The Leader-Telegram noted that Peterson \"can play the blues coarse or fine, sometimes with a little humor mixed in.\" The Tampa Tribune opined that Peterson \"is in the front ranks of American blues/jazz organists.\" The Liverpool Echo called Peterson \"an expressive singer with a superb smokey voice.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Balconettes (French: Les Femmes au balcon) is an upcoming 2024 French comedy horror film directed by, co-written by, and starring Noémie Merlant. Also starring Souheila Yacoub and Sanda Codreanu, the film follows three young women during a heatwave in the south of France.\nThe film is set to premiere in the non-competitive Midnight Screenings section at the 77th Cannes Film Festival in May 2024.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nDuring a heat wave in Marseille, three roommates are cooped up in their apartment. From the balcony they look out at their mysterious neighbor, about whom they indulge in all sorts of fantasies. However, late into the night, an ordinary conflict turns into a bloodbath.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nSouheila Yacoub\nNoémie Merlant\nSanda Codreanu\nLucas Bravo\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe Balconettes is the second feature film by French actress Noémie Merlant, who is primarily known as an actress, following her award-winning debut film Mi Iubita Mon Amour (2021). Noémie Merlant wrote the screenplay in collaboration with Céline Sciamma, who previously directed Merlant in her 2019 historical drama film Portrait of a Lady on Fire. The Balconettes was touted in advance as \"bloody, punk and exhilarating\" and as a \"comedy horror\". Pierre Guyard produced the film for Nord-Ouest Films, a role which he had previously undertaken on Mi Iubita Mon Amour.\n Merlant decided to take on one of the main roles, as in her directorial debut, alongside Souheila Yacoub and Sanda Codreanu. Codreanu had also previously been entrusted with a larger role in Mi Iubita Mon Amour.\nFilming was originally scheduled to begin in August 2023. Due to an impending filming conflict with Audrey Diwan's film project Emmanuelle, in which Merlant had been given the title role, the start of filming was brought forward to July. Principal photography began on 10 July 2023 in Marseille and took place there for seven weeks. The project was financially supported by the government film funding agency CNC, as well as by Canal+ and France Télévisions. The production costs were given as 3.5 million euros.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe Balconettes was selected to be screened out of competition in the Midnight Screenings section at the 77th Cannes Film Festival, where it will have its world premiere in May 2024.The film is scheduled to be theatrically released in France by Tandem. International sales are handled by mk2 Films.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Balconettes at IMDb",

        "content": "Nathan Decron (born 17 February 1998) is a France rugby union player who plays as a centre for Pau in the Top 14 competition. He won the Rugby Europe Under-18 Championship in 2015 with the France national under-18 rugby union team.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nNathan Decron began playing rugby union at his hometown club in 2007. In 2013, he joined the SU Agen training center, making his breakthrough into the first team in 2016. In 2017, he moved to Bordeaux, signing a three-year espoir contract with Union Bordeaux Bègles. Hindered by injuries, he returned to SU Agen in 2019.\n\n\n=== Early Years at SU Agen ===\nDecron began his professional career in the 2016-17 Pro D2 season, playing five matches. He made his debut against Stade montois.\n\n\n=== Union Bordeaux Bègles ===\nDuring the 2018–2019 season, he made six appearances for Union Bordeaux Bègles, five in Top 14 and one in the EPCR Challenge Cup. A knee injury in the 3rd round of the Espoirs French Championship against SU Agen kept him out for the following season, leading to an extensive rehabilitation at the CERS de Capbreton.\n\n\n=== Return to SU Agen ===\nHe was loaned to SU Agen by UBB for the 2019–20 season. In February 2020, he signed his first professional contract with the Lot-et-Garonne club until 2022. In December 2020, he was named captain for the match against CA Brive. He experienced Agen's nightmare 2020–21 Top 14 season, concluding with no victories in Top 14.\n\n\n=== Fresh start at Section Paloise ===\nDuring the offseason, he joined Section Paloise from the 2021–22 Top 14 season season. He reunited with his best friend Clément Laporte. Following an excellent start to the season, he injured his back during training and suffered a Spinal disc herniation in January 2022. Despite rehabilitation at CERS de Capbreton, he faced difficulties, including flat feet after short distances. Electromyograms showed initial nerve deficits of 70%, reduced to 50% after six months but persisting despite progress. Decron missed 11 months of competition.\nIt was during the 2022–23 Top 14 season that Nathan Decron made his comeback, participating in 7 Top 14 matches and 3 EPCR Challenge Cup matches. Two seasons after this string of injuries, Nathan Decron has fully recovered and regained his peak physical form, although he still contends with nerve deficits necessitating compensatory muscle strengthening. Nonetheless, Decron has emerged as a linchpin for Section Paloise in 2023-24. This advancement secured him a three-season contract extension.\n\n\n== National Team Career ==\nNathan Decron won the Rugby Europe Under-18 Championship in Toulouse in 2015 against Georgia with a score of 57–0. He scored 2 tries in this match.\nHe participated in the 2017 World Rugby Under 20 Championship in Georgia with the France national under-20 rugby union team. In the same year, he took part in the Six Nations Under 20s Championship.\nIn January 2021, he participated in the Six Nations 2021 training camp in Nice with the France national rugby union team, as a training partner.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nInternational\n1× Rugby Europe Under-18 Championship: 2015\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Nathan Decron at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Air Vice-Marshal Stephen Gareth Chappell,  (born 1975) is a senior officer in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), serving as Head Military Strategic Commitments since July 2022. He joined the RAAF through the Australian Defence Force Academy in 1993 and gained his pilot's wings in 1998. He has deployed on Operations Falconer and Okra to Iraq, and has commanded No. 1 Squadron RAAF (2013–16) and No. 82 Wing RAAF (2018–20). He is to be appointed Chief of Air Force in July 2024.\n\n\n== Early life and family ==\nChappell was born in 1975 to Judith (née Donaldson) and Greg Chappell. His father is a former professional cricketer, who was away on a cricketing tour of England when Stephen was born. He has a younger sister, Belinda, and a younger brother, Jonathan, who played Minor League Baseball for the Pulaski Blue Jays and the Rockford Riverhawks. Chappell's uncles are former Test cricketers Ian Chappell and Trevor Chappell, and he is the great-grandson of accomplished sportsman Vic Richardson.\nChappell was educated at Brisbane Grammar School, where he played in the First XI in cricket. According to his father, Chappell's interest in aviation was sparked by seeing the film Top Gun as a child.\n\n\n== RAAF career ==\nChappell entered the Australian Defence Force Academy as a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) officer cadet in January 1993. He graduated from the academy with a Bachelor of Arts in 1995. Following flying training, he converted to the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet and was posted to No. 75 Squadron RAAF in December 1998. He qualified as a Fighter Combat Instructor in 2001 and was then posted to No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit RAAF as an instructor. In 2003, Chappell returned to No. 75 Squadron to take part in Operation Falconer, Australia's contribution to the invasion of Iraq. Following his return to Australia, he was promoted to squadron leader in 2004 and made a flight commander in No. 3 Squadron RAAF.\nSelected for an exchange posting with the United States Air Force, Chappell served as the Assistant Director of Operations for the recently reactivated 65th Aggressor Squadron, based at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, from July 2005 to December 2007. During the exchange, Chappell authored five papers on communication standards, weapons employment and threat missile systems, and led the squadron in one Maple Flag and five Red Flag exercises. He was subsequently awarded the United States Meritorious Service Medal for the \"exceptional initiative and vision\" he demonstrated in his work with the squadron. Returning to Australia, Chappell was made executive officer of No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit in 2008, a staff officer at No. 81 Wing RAAF in January 2010 and, following promotion to wing commander in April 2011, was appointed to the staff of Air Combat Group Headquarters. In the 2013 Queen's Birthday Honours, Chappell was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for his \"meritorious service to the Royal Australian Air Force in the field of Air Combat\".\nChappell graduated from the Australian Command and Staff College with a Master of Military and Strategic Studies in 2013. That December, he was appointed commanding officer of No. 1 Squadron RAAF. In September 2014, he deployed with the squadron to Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates as part of Air Task Group 630 on Operation Okra, Australia's contribution to the war against the Islamic State. Chappell returned to Australia in April 2015 and relinquished command of the squadron in June 2016. In January 2017, as part of the Australia Day Honours, he was awarded the Conspicuous Service Cross for \"outstanding achievement in air combat development and preparedness\" as commander of No. 1 Squadron and, in the Queen's Birthday Honours that June, he received the Distinguished Service Cross in recognition of his \"distinguished command and leadership\" on Operation Okra.\nAfter serving as executive officer of No. 82 Wing RAAF, Chappell completed the Defence and Strategic Studies Course at the Australian College of Defence and Strategic Studies in 2017. He then spent twelve months as chief of staff to the Chief of the Defence Force, serving Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin and then General Angus Campbell, before assuming command of No. 82 Wing in December 2018. Promoted to air commodore in November 2020, Chappell was made Director General Air Command Operations. He was promoted to air vice-marshal and appointed Head Military Strategic Commitments in July 2022.\nIn April 2024 the Minister of Defence, Richard Marles, announced that Chappell will be appointed Chief of Air Force in July 2024.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Santissimo Crocifisso is a Roman Catholic parish church, located in the center town of Pontedera in the province of Pisa, Tuscany, Italy.\n\n\n== History ==\nThis church was originally dedicated to Saints Filippo, Jacopo, and Biagio (Phillip, Jacob, and Blaise) built in the town center in the 13th century to replace the functions of the extramural church of San Martino. Built originally between 1270 and 1272, the church suffered a devastating fire in on Holy Friday of 1612, which, putatively miraculously spared the altar crucifix. These events prompted a reconstruction and refurbishment. Only in 1936 was the dedication changed to that of the Holy Crucifix.\nHowever, the church structure suffered severe damage from the allied bombardment of World War II. Restorations took place during 1956-1959 led by Renzo Bellucci. Part of the building was used by the town cinema until 2006. Further restrorations of the interiors and surrounding piazza were performed in the 21st century, under the directions of Fabio Scarpetti.\nWhile the exterior is very plain, the interior holds various works of note:\n\nAn altarpiece depicting the Madonna of the Rosary Between Saints Monica, Dominic, and Bishop Augustine (1595) by il Cigoli.\nAn altarpiece depicting the Madonna and Child Interceding for Souls in Purgatory (1687–1689) by Benedetto Luti\nA silver tabernacle above the main altar sculpted in 18th century by Gaspare and Silvestro Mariotti; it holds the revered crucifix.\nFlanking the altar are silver reliquary busts of St Peter and a martyred saint\nA wooden Madonna of the Annunciation (14th century) from the studio of Nino Pisano\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Manuel Adame Misa (1901–1945) was an Andalusian trade unionist and politician. Initially an anarcho-syndicalist of the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT), in 1927, he became a leading member of the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) in Andalusia. In 1932, he was ejected from the PCE, due to his conflicts with the leadership of the Communist International, and subsequently joined the Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT) and Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE). He was active in the Republican side of the Spanish Civil War and, after its defeat, fled to Mexico, where he died.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nManuel Adame Misa was born in 1901 in the Andalusian city of Seville. He worked as a day labourer and was a member of the Seville branch of the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT).\nThe leader of a local communist group, which included José Díaz, Antonio Mije and Manuel Delicado among its members, in 1927, he joined the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) and was appointed as the head of its trade union section. From August of that year, he pursued a strategy of communist entryism in the CNT, in collaboration with the CNT's secretary general Joan Peiró. In December 1927, he was appointed as the PCE's regional secretary of Andalusia. By the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic, he was already the undisputed leader of the PCE in Seville. From 1931 to 1932, he was a member of the PCE's central committee, and after that, he was a member of its political bureau. In the 1931 Spanish general election, Adame was presented as one of the PCE's candidates for the Constituent Cortes, but they failed to win any seats.\nIn the by-election that took place in the Balearic Islands in October 1931, Adame was presented as the PCE's candidate. With 628 votes (1.88%), Adame came third, losing the election to Francesc Carreras Reura of Republican Action, who received 22,406 votes. He mostly received votes from dissident republicans and socialists, who were dissatisfied with Carreras' candidacy. More than three-quarters of his votes came from Palma, where he received 5.97% of the vote; he also received 6.99% of the vote in Capdepera and 6.45% of the vote in Pollença. He only received 8 votes in Menorca and 1 vote in Eivissa.\nIn the wake of the PCE's fourth congress in March 1932, the political bureau - which included José Bullejos, Gabriel León Trilla and Adame himself - was deposed due to their persistent clashes with the leadership of the Communist International. On 21 October 1932, Adame, Trilla and Bullejos were expelled from the PCE. The following year, Adame joined the Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT) and became its secretary general in Seville, as well as the leader of the local group of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE). His defection from the PCE to the PSOE-UGT intensified a communist smear campaign against him. He nevertheless continued his work as a trade union leader throughout the subsequent years, taking a leading role in the Revolution of 1934 in Seville, for which he was arrested.\nDuring the 1936 Spanish general election, he was elected as a deputy of the PSOE for the province of Seville. When Adame received news of the Spanish coup of July 1936, he was in Benamahoma, where he organised Andalusian resistance to the coup. After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he was delegated by the socialists to serve in the military command in Málaga, then aided Andalusian refugees in Barcelona, and headed the Under-Secretariat of Armaments.\nAfter the defeat of the Republicans, he fled to France, where he was held in the Gurs internment camp. He moved to Mexico in October 1942, settling in Acapulco, where he ran a flower plantation. Manuel Adame Misa died on 3 April 1945. In the years after his death, he was frequently denounced as a \"traitor\" in the Spanish communist press. In 1949, Adame was sentenced in absentia by the Francoist dictatorship, but upon discovery that he had died in Mexico, the proceedings were dismissed.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\nEl comité Nacional de Reconstrucción y la política sindical del Partido (1931);\nQué es el Bloque Obrero y Campesino (1932);\n¿Alianza Obrera? ¡No!

        "content": "Telling the Story of the Exodus (Hebrew: סיפור יציאת מצרים) is a Torah commandment to tell the story of the Exodus from Egypt on the night of the 15th of Nisan every year. This commandment is the basis and the central motive for reciting the Passover Haggadah on the Seder night. The commandment applies to every person from Israel and includes all the stories mentioned in the Scripture about the miracles performed for the Children of Israel when they left Egypt.\n\n\n== The Source and Essence of the Commandment ==\nThe commandment is based on the verse: And you shall tell your son in that day, saying, 'This is done because of what the Lord did for me when I came up from Egypt.' \nThe Mishna rules on this verse: In every generation, a person is obligated to see themselves as if they themselves went out from Egypt... Therefore, we are obligated to give thanks, to praise, to laud, to glorify, to exalt, to honor, to bless, to raise up, and to acclaim the One who did all these miracles for our ancestors and for us: Taking us out from slavery to freedom, from grief to joy, from mourning to a festival day, from darkness to great light, and from subjugation to redemption. And let us say before Him: Hallelujah.\n\n\n== The Time of Fulfilling the Commandment ==\nUnlike the commandment of remembering the Exodus from Egypt, the commandment of recounting has a specific date. Thus, the Mekhilta de-Rabbi Yishmael that the commandment of recounting the Haggadah to the son needs to be when it is possible to say \"because of this\" (Ba'Avur Ze) and to point to the symbols of exile and redemption, that is when matzah and maror are placed on the table, namely on the Seder night. According to this determination, other decisors also proceeded, and emphasized that from the beginning of the night there is a commandment to recount.\n\n\n== How to Fulfill the Commandment ==\n\nThe Mishnah details several guiding rules for fulfilling the commandment to recount the Exodus from Egypt, which are implemented on the Seder night and in the Passover Haggadah, particularly in the section \"Maggid\" dedicated to the story of the Exodus from Egypt:\n\nThe story needs to be told through a method of question and answer, assuming that this is a preferred way to pass the story from generation to generation.\n\"Start with disgrace and end with praise\", meaning one should tell the sequence of events, from the trouble to the redemption. Some say this is intended to recognize the greatness of the miracle and salvation, and some emphasize that the matter is intended to arouse sensitivity and consideration for the convert and anyone who needs help and mercy.\nSaying \"Pesach, Matzah, and Maror\" along with an explanation for fulfilling these commandments. Meaning, the story should be connected to the fulfillment of the holiday's commandments.\n\"In every generation, a person must see himself as if he himself left Egypt as it is said, And you shall tell your son on that day, saying, 'Because of this, the Lord did for me when I came out of Egypt.'\" Rambam phrases it \"In every generation, a person is obligated to show himself as if he himself now came out from the bondage of Egypt.\" Based on this principle, various customs developed, aimed at illustrating the Exodus from Egypt during the Seder night.\nPraise and gratitude - Among the commandments of recounting the Exodus from Egypt is to conclude with praise, gratitude, and song to God for taking the Children of Israel \"from slavery to freedom, from sorrow to joy, from mourning to festivity\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Hirlatzhöhle is a cave in the Dachstein massif in the municipality of Hallstatt in the Upper Austrian part of the Salzkammergut. The total length of the cave known to date is over 115 km. It is therefore the third longest cave in Austria and, at 1559 m deep, the second deepest cave in Austria. The deepest point is at 443 m above sea level and therefore 65 m below the water level of the nearby Hallstättersee. It is the 22nd longest cave system in the world.\n\n\n== Geographical ==\nThe system extends from Oberfeld in the east to Gamskogel in the west. The east–west extent is 5445 m, the north–south extent is 3662 m.\nVertically, the cave extends over 1560 meters, reaching from 2,003 m (6,571 ft 6+1⁄2 in) down to 443 m (1,453 ft 5 in)\nsea level.\nThe cave has six entrances. Three of them are only usable for divers, another is in a steep rock face and the fifth only opens up a small part of the cave without diving. Due to these circumstances, there is actually only one usable entrance for efficient exploration, which results in complex expeditions lasting several days for exploration, especially in areas far from daylight.\n\n\n== Research ==\nResearch is still ongoing in the Hirlatzhöhle. The research is coordinated by the Hallstatt-Obertraun Cave Association. The cave is closed all year round. To avoid a collapse, a blast was carried out during an inspection. Step aids, footbridges and ladders make it easier for research teams to navigate, but this is only possible in the months from January to March, as at other times of the year the water level in some parts of the cave can fluctuate very quickly and repeatedly leads to flooding.A great success was achieved through the merger with the What u Got Pot (formerly Schmeltwasserhöhle, cadastral no. 1543/173). This shaft cave was explored and documented up to a length of 7,191 m by British researchers between 2007 and 2018. A horizontal system was approached 830 meters below the entrance, from where it was possible to climb through to the Hirlatzhöhle on September 6, 2018. Further research successes can be expected in this area in the future.\nA significant increase in length arose from the merger of the Upper Brandgrabenhöhle (cadastral no. 1546/6) with the Hirlatzhöhle on December 28, 2011, by the cave diver Gerhard Wimmer. The length of the Hirlatzhöhle exceeded the 100 km mark for the first time at 100,068m. The known depth at this time was 1,073 m.\nAn obstacle to further research inside the cave is a huge vent called Dark Star, which has already been explored at a height of more than 270 meters and reaches even further up, but requires climbing up through loose rock is made more difficult. There was hope of finding a connection further up to a still largely unexplored cave area called Wadiland. The Wadiland, in which a large tunnel with an estimated width of at least 80 meters has already been identified, can otherwise only be reached via a 200 meter long siphon, which cannot be overcome for dry research. Dives, on the other hand, are difficult to organize because the equipment first has to be transported into the cave interior over numerous narrow passages over several days.\nIn January 2005, Ulrich Meyer immersed himself in two siphons in the east of the Hirlatzhöhle. This dive at such a great distance of 11,500 m from the cave entrance is a world record.\n\n\n== Nature conservation ==\nIn Austria, caves are in principle (ex-lege) under strict nature conservation. This cave also became the Naturdenkmal (nd600 (number in the nature conservation book of the state of Upper Austria), Hallstatt and Obertraun) explained. The area is located in the core zone of the UNESCO World Heritage area Cultural Landscape Hallstatt–Dachstein/Salzkammergut (WHS 806) and in Europe- and Nature reserve Dachstein (Bird sanctuary and FFH area, AT3101000/EU02; N098).\n\n\n== Incidents ==\nOn February 28, 2016, 54-year-old cave explorer Stefan D. from Germany, a member of a five-member group of German and Czech researchers, suddenly collapsed in the cave 2 km from the entrance. Two men got out and were able to alert the Hallstatt mountain rescue service at 7:30 a.m. The doctor visited the victim at 1 p.m. and diagnosed him as dead and already experiencing rigor mortis. The body was brought to the surface on the same day by the Austrian cave rescue team.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nARGE Hirlatzhöhlendocumentation (ed.): The Hirlatzhöhle in the Dachstein.

        "content": "The Chabahar–Zahedan railway is a railway line currently under construction in Iran.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe rail line is to connect the port of Chahbahar, which is located on the Indian Ocean, to the country's rail network via Zahedan - from 2021 according to the original plans. The port is the only deep-water port in Iran that has direct access to the Indian Ocean without ships having to pass through the narrow Strait of Hormuz. The railroad therefore also has strategic military significance for Iran. For India, this route represents a chance for freight traffic to obtain a water/land connection to Russia, bypassing Pakistan. India was therefore reported to contribute to the construction of the railroad line financially. There were confusion about Indian involvement in the project later in 2020.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first tracks were laid in November 2020. Commissioning is scheduled for 2024.\n\n\n== Technical details ==\nThe line will be 750 kilometers long and built on a single track with the standard gauge common in Iran. The maximum gradient will be 15 ‰ with a maximum curve radius of 1000 meters. The line is designed for a maximum permissible speed of 120 km/h for passenger trains and 90 km/h for freight trains. It is planned to transport 1.3 million tons of goods in the first year of operation, which is planned to be increased to 35 million tons within the next 20 years.\n\n\n== Expansion plans ==\nAt a later date, the route is to be extended from Zahedan around 800 kilometers north via Mashhad to Seraqs on the border with Turkmenistan. This will create a north–south connection along Iran's eastern border, giving the landlocked Central Asian states the shortest access to a seaport. A branch to Afghanistan is planned near Zaranj to facilitate trade in goods.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Moses Rosenkranz (1904–2003) was a German-language poet of Jewish descent. He was born in Berehomet in the former Austro-Hungarian Empire. Berehomet is part of the region of Bukovina which once hosted a large Bukovina German population; the village now falls within modern-day Ukraine. Other Bukovina Germans of Jewish origin who gained renown as writers include Paul Celan and Rose Auslander.\nRosenkranz's life was dogged by persecution, first by the Romanian regime of Ion Antonescu, followed by the Soviet gulag system and the Romanian communist regime of Nicolae Ceaușescu. He finally left for Germany in 1961, and settled down in the Black Forest region. He lived in the vicinity of Lenzkirch, where he died at the age of 98.\nBukovina was integral to his literary output throughout his life. In addition to his poetry, he is also known for his series of memoirs under the title Fragment of an Autobiography. The first volume Childhood was translated into English by David Dollenmayer, who won the Wolff Prize for his rendering.\n\n\n== References ==",

She was elected to Ecuador's national assembly  before she became a Municipal Councilor of Guayaquil, representing Urban Constituency 1 for the Social Christian Party.\n\n\n== Life ==\nMontaño was born in San Lorenzo in 1955 in the province of Esmeraldas. At the age of 15, she moved to Guayaquil where she ventured into radio and then television. She was an announcer for Radio Canela who was known as \"La Bombón\". She was recruited for the program Divinas, on Canal Uno. She was one of six presenters raising issues that were of concern to women.\nIn 2013 she was an unsuccessful candidate for vice-prefecture for the Social Christian Party, with César Rohón.\nShe was chosen as one of the lead candidates by the Social Democratic party in 2016 for the February 2017 legislative elections. She was elected to be a national assembly member representing Guayas Province.\nWithin her functions as an assembly member, she drafted different bills including one to reform the law against crimes including murder committed against children and adolescents. She was a critic of the assembly's poor productivity when she was identified as an \"independent\" in 2018.\nIn 2019 she resigned from the assembly to run as a candidate for Guayaquil Municipal Councilor representing urban constituency 1. She won the corresponding seat as the councilor with the highest votes in the city with 222,766 votes supporting her. In the first of the Guayaquil's council sessions of 2024 she called for unity given the poor state of security in the city.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024 Ipswich City Council election was held on 16 March 2024 to elect a mayor and eight councillors to the City of Ipswich. The election was held as part of the statewide local elections in Queensland, Australia.\nTeresa Harding was re-elected mayor with 57.73% of the vote after preferences, a swing of 5.25% against her.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAt the 2020 election, Teresa Harding was elected mayor, defeating six other candidates. She was the first non-Labor Party aligned Ipswich mayor in 50 years.\nFour independents, two Independent Labor candidates and two candidates on the \"Your Voice Of Experience\" ticket were also elected as councillors.\nDivision 3 councillor Marnie Doyle joined the Labor Party in March 2023.\n\n\n== Electoral system ==\nPrior to 2020, Ipswich City Council was composed of a directly elected mayor and 10 single-member wards (or divisions), both using optional preferential voting.\nIn July 2019, it was announced that the 10 single-member wards would be replaced by four two-member wards, reducing the total amount of councillors to eight. Preferential voting was removed and replaced by plurality block voting (also referred to as first-past-the-post by the Electoral Commission), where voters are only required to mark the same amount of candidates as there are positions to be elected − in the case of Ipswich, two candidates.\nOptional preferential voting is used for the mayoral election.\n\n\n== Candidates ==\nIn April 2023, former councillor David Martin stated he would again run for mayor after his unsuccessful campaign in 2020.\nDivision 1 councillor Sheila Ireland announced in December 2023 that she would contest the mayoralty and form Team Sheila Ireland.\nMarnie Doyle and Andrew Fechner, the two Division 3 councillors, formed the \"Better Brighter Ipswich\" ticket in early 2024. Former mayor Andrew Antoniolli, who won the 2017 by-election before the council was dismissed in 2018, also contested Division 3 as an independent, having previously been a Labor member.\nOn 26 January 2024, Ipswich West MP Jim Madden resigned from the Queensland state parliament to contest Division 4. This triggered a by-election in his seat, held on the same day as the local elections.\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n=== Mayor ===\n\n\n=== Councillors ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Market House of Portland, Maine, was located in what was then known as Market Square or Haymarket Square (today's Monument Square) between 1825 and 1888, when it was demolished. In 1833, the building was modified to become Portland's first city hall. The Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, which now stands in its place, was dedicated in 1891.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Town of Portland built a market house in Market (or Haymarket) Square 1825. Also known as Military Hall, the first floor in the building's early years housed stalls used by farmers to sell agricultural products. In 1827, the upper floor housed the second public gymnasium in the country, founded by eccentric and influential writer, critic, and activist John Neal. The gym was based on Turnen gymnastics, which Neal learned in London from Carl Voelker, a German refugee. It was Maine's first organized athletic program, making Neal the \"father of athletics in Maine\" according to historian William Barry. Called the Portland Gymnasium, it had 300 members by 1828.The building's simple gable appearance was modified in 1833, to plans made the previous year by Charles Quincy Clapp, to become Portland's first city hall. Clapp updated the building to the Greek Revival style by removing the cupola from the roof and adding a portico to the front. The cupola was reinstalled on the Universalist school house (now Alumni Hall on the University of New England campus) in Portland's Deering neighborhood.The new building was the site of the 1855 Portland Rum Riot, which involved mayor Neal Dow and led to one death.The United States Hotel, built in 1803, stood behind both iterations of the building.28 Monument Square was built in 1871. In 2006, the first floor and basement of the building became the home of Public Market House, in which several vendors flank a narrow central corridor. Some vendors relocated to Public Market House from the nearby Portland Public Market building, at the corner of Preble Street and Cumberland Avenue, which closed earlier the same year.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Trypilska TPP (Ukrainian: Трипільська ТЕС) was a 1800 MW thermal power station located on the Dnipro river, about 40 km downstream of the city of Kyiv, in Ukraine, built by the Soviet Union in 1969 and completed in 1977.\nDuring the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the station was permanently disabled on 11 April 2024 after Russian missiles set fire to the main turbine hall. It was the largest power plant in the Kyiv Oblast region.\n\n\n== Operations ==\nThe main assets of the Trypilska TPP were four pulverized coal and two diesel fuel units with a capacity of 300 MW each. There were also six turbines and generators with a total nominal capacity of 1,800 MW. The transformers are of the TDC-400000/330 type.\nThe fuel facility consists of an open coal storage with a capacity of 280,000 tons, which was serviced by two portal cranes and bulldozers.\nThe main fuel was Donetsk anthracite coal, which arrived by rail and river to the station berth.\nThe station was connected to the gas transport system of Ukraine. Also, the fuel economy had containers for using fuel oil as fuel.\n\n\n== History ==\nKyiv Oblast is known for being energy-rich. Power-generating enterprises with a total capacity of 3,200 MW are located on its territory, of which the installed capacity of the Trypil TPP is about 57%. Therefore, the energy-generating enterprise is the largest supplier of electricity in Kyiv, Cherkasy and Zhytomyr Oblasts. The enterprise occupies an area of 281.3 hectares. It is located in Obukhiv Raion on the bank of the Kaniv Reservoir.\nIn January 1962, a Decree of the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic approved the development of a thermal power plant in the Trypilska site. The trusts \"Pivdenteploenergomontazh\", \"Hydroelektromontazh\", \"Hydromechanization\", \"Pivdenzahidtransbud\" and many others participated in the construction of the station. The first unit was connected to the grid in December 1969 and the plant was completed in 1977.\nA great deal of work on the analysis of the project, start-up and adjustment of the equipment was performed by the enterprise \"LvivORGRES\".\nThe construction of the power plant was carried out by the progressive current-speed method. This method made it possible to significantly shorten the construction period of the power plant.\n\n\n== Airstrike ==\nOn April 11, 2024, the station was targeted with Shahed drones and Kh-69 missiles, resulting in a massive fire. As of 7 o'clock in the morning, the fire was still burning. Subsequently, Ukraine's Centrenergo officially announced the complete destruction of the power plant.\nOn 16 April 2024, President Zelenskyy, said that “Eleven missiles were launched towards the Trypillya [thermal power] station, upon which the electricity supply in the Kyiv region depends. We managed to intercept the first seven, but the remaining four hit Trypillya. Why? Because we had zero missiles left. We have exhausted all the missiles that were defending Trypillya,”.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of power stations in Ukraine\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Lorenzo Pagans and Auguste de Gas is the title of a painting by Edgar Degas. Painted in oil on canvas, it is 54.5 cm high and 39.5 cm wide. The double portrait, painted around 1871–1872, shows the Catalan tenor Lorenzo Pagans performing a song and guitar recital. The painter's father, Auguste de Gas, sits in the audience behind him. The painting is one of a series of portraits of musicians that Degas painted beginning in the late 1860s. It is in the collection of the Musée d'Orsay in Paris.\n\n\n== Image description ==\nThe painting Lorenzo Pagans and Auguste de Gas is a double portrait in an interior. The central figure in the middle of the painting is the Spanish singer Lorenzo Pagans, sitting frontally opposite the viewer, with Auguste de Gas, Edgar Degas' father, seated behind him on the right. Both men are wearing a dark suit, dark shoes, and a white shirt. Pagans is also wearing a dark tie and a boutonnière on his left lapel. He is sitting in the posture of a guitar player with his legs crossed on a simple wooden chair. Pagans rests the instrument on his thighs, placing his right hand on the body to play the strings and his left hand on the neck. The guitar's light-colored wood and mother-of-pearl-like inlays around the soundhole and body edge stand in stark contrast to Pagans' dark suit. A dark green ribbon tied to the head of the guitar, on the other hand, is barely noticeable. The musician's head is tilted slightly to the right edge of the frame, and his dark eyes seem to be fixed on something outside the frame to the right. His mouth is half open, giving the impression that Pagans is performing a song. Pagans' face has a healthy, light complexion. A broad, dark mustache, the ends of which are twisted into points, is noticeable. His dark, slightly curly hair is cut short, leaving his ears uncovered.\nIn contrast to the young singer Pagans, Auguste de Gas, sitting diagonally behind him, is a man marked by age. His posture is characterized by his upper body leaning forward, his head pointing downwards and his hands clasped together in front of his knees. The face is depicted in half profile. The ends of a gray moustache point downwards and a high forehead emphasizes the thinning hair. Edgar Degas depicts his father as an attentive listener looking down, lost in thought. His role takes a back seat to that of the singer Pagan, who dominates this double portrait.\nWhile Edgar Degas rendered the faces, hands, and guitar with precise descriptions, other areas of the painting are executed in a fleeting style. The room in which the two sitters are standing is only partially visible. The wooden floor is outlined with horizontal brushstrokes in iridescent shades of brown and gray. Pagans' wooden chair, with its legs and cross-bracing, stands on it. Father de Gas may be sitting on a piano bench or stool, but no such furniture is visible in the painting, as Pagans have obscured this area. Behind the two figures is a dark grand piano, the keyboard of which extends to the edge of the picture to the right of Auguste de Gas. Behind Father de Gas, an open music book on the piano's music stand frames the sitter's head. More music lies on the closed piano lid at the left edge of the picture. Above the musical instrument is a reddish-brown painted wall on which hangs two framed pictures cut off by the top edge of the painting. The two pictures are poorly executed and do not reveal the subject. Light falls on the scene from an unknown source, creating highlights on the guitar and the foreheads, cheeks, and hands of the two sitters.\nThe bodies of Lorenzo Pagans and Auguste de Gas are not facing each other, but both are facing the room. It can be assumed that there are other people in the area outside the right edge of the picture. It remains unclear, however, whether Pagans is looking at other people. His gaze can also be read as a sign of concentration on his lecture. Auguste de Gas is not necessarily looking at anything either, although his eyes are open. His facial expression emphasizes his intense listening. In this painting, Edgar Degas has not only depicted the contrast between a young man and an old man but also the theme of music, with the singer and guitarist performing and his listener. Author Melissa MacQuillan comments, \"Rarely has the relationship between the musical performer and his listener been so clearly depicted.\n\n\n== Variations on the theme ==\nAround the same time as the portrait of Lorenzo Pagans and Auguste de Gas, Degas created a variation of the subject entitled Degas' Father Listening to Lorenzo Pagans (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston). In this version, Lorenzo Pagans is shown in profile and moved to the left edge of the painting. He is clearly in the shadow area of the painting and thus plays a secondary role. The main figure in this painting is Auguste de Gas, whose head appears in the brighter light and who has otherwise assumed the same position as in the double portrait of Lorenzo Pagans and Auguste de Gas. These two paintings are among the few portraits that Edgar Degas painted of his father. After Auguste de Gas died in 1874, his son took up the subject again. In an 1882 double portrait of Pagans and Degas' father (private collection), Pagans is seen singing with a music book in his hand. Here, Degas' father sits as a peripheral figure in the background. There is also a pastel sketch of this painting (private collection). A few months before Lorenzo Pagans died in 1882, he also painted the portrait Portrait of Lorenzo Pagans (Man with a Cigar) (National Gallery, Prague), in which the musician is portrayed as a half-length portrait in a private pose and without any reference to his existence as a musician.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Background for creating the painting ==\nThe Auguste de Gas depicted in the painting was the father of the painter Edgar Degas and was known as a music lover. The scene of the painting Lorenzo Pagans and Auguste de Gas takes place in the music room of his apartment at 4 rue de Mondovi in the 1st arrondissement of Paris. Family and friends met here every Monday evening to exchange ideas, sometimes enriched by musical performances. Auguste de Gas's daughter Marguerite, his friend Blanche Camus, and the pianist Suzanne Manet, who came with her husband, the painter Édouard Manet, played on Érard's grand piano. The singer and pianist Marie Dihau also performed in Auguste de Gas's salon, and her brother, the bassoonist Désiré Dihau, came from the Paris Opera. Beginning in the late 1860s, his son, Edgar Degas, discovered opera as a subject for his paintings, repeatedly depicting musicians alongside ballet dancers. In The Orchestra of the Opera (Musée d'Orsay), for example, he painted a group portrait of the bassoonist Désiré Dihau. Degas also portrayed various musicians in domestic settings. These include the portraits The Cellist Pilet (Musée d'Orsay), Madame Camus at the Piano (E. G. Bührle Collection, Zurich), and Marie Dihau at the Piano (Musée d'Orsay). Like Lorenzo Pagans in the double portrait with Father de Gas, all these musicians are shown with their instruments. This is also true of the double portrait of two unknown persons in the painting Violinist with Young Woman (Detroit Institute of Arts), painted around 1871. This painting bears certain similarities to the painting by Lorenzo Pagan and Auguste de Gas. In both paintings, the subject is music in a private salon, not a performance in a concert hall. In addition, both paintings are sparsely furnished, and the wall with the cropped picture frames in the double portrait of Lorenzo Pagan and Auguste de Gas finds its counterpart in the fireplace cropped from the right edge in the painting Violinist with Young Woman. Above all, there are parallels in the execution: In both paintings, Degas finely worked out the heads of the figures, while large parts of the composition show a rather fleeting brushstroke.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nIn the late 1860s, Edgar Degas received permission from the Paris Opera to sketch the ballet dancers and orchestra musicians backstage and during rehearsals. He knew Lorenzo Pagans, who had been a celebrated tenor in Paris for several years and also gave recitals in private salons. Edgar Degas could hear Pagans not only at his father's house but also at the house of his friend Manets, where the singer was also a guest. Édouard Manet also created a portrait of the singer in 1879 with the small-format Portrait of Monsieur Pagans (private collection). It is possible that Manet's 1860 painting The Spanish Singer (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) was a model for Degas's depiction of Lorenzo Pagans in a double portrait with his father. The musician portrayed by Manet is also shown singing and playing the guitar but in a folkloric setting.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nFrom a French perspective, the guitar was considered a typical Spanish instrument, along with the castanets and the tambourine. A Spanish fashion, which could be observed in France from the middle of the 19th century, was triggered not least by the Empress Eugénie, who came from Spain. Accordingly, Spanish dancers and musicians appeared with great success on the Parisian stages, some of them delighting the audience with folkloristic performances, others excelling in the classical repertoire. While in 18th-century paintings, such as those of Antoine Watteau or Nicolas Lancret, the guitar can be seen being played by the common people, in the 19th century its reputation changed to that of a noble instrument. Pagans was known for singing Spanish songs, one of which he may be performing in the painting Lorenzo Pagans and Auguste de Gas, accompanying himself on the guitar. He also played works from the classical repertoire in private salons, including pieces by Jean-Philippe Rameau, as the Goncourt brothers recalled.\n\n\n== Origin ==\nThe painting Lorenzo Pagan and Auguste de Gas was in the possession of Edgar Degas until his death in 1917. He cherished the painting and kept it in his bedroom above his bed, where only a few friends saw it. The painting was inherited by the artist's brother, René de Gas. After his death, his daughter, Odette Nepveu-de Gas, inherited the painting. In 1933, the painting was donated to the Louvre by the Société des Amis du Louvre, with the help of the art critic Marcel Guérin and the patron David David-Weill. From 1947, the painting was exhibited at the Jeu de Paume in Paris and has been part of the Musée d'Orsay collection since 1986.\n\n\n== External links ==\nInformation on the painting Lorenzo Pagans et Auguste de Gas on the Musée d'Orsay website\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nFelix Baumann, Marianne Karabelnik (Ed.), Jean Sutherland Boggs: Degas, die Portraits.

        "content": "Robert Vambery (5 December 1907 – 2 August 1999) was a theatre director, author and teacher, associated with the works of Kurt Weill.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nVambery was born in Budapest and educated in Germany. In 1927 Ernst Josef Aufricht engaged him as the literary director of the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm in Berlin. In that role he was involved in the first production of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill's The Threepenny Opera, and made German versions of Donizetti's La Fille du régiment and Gilbert and Sullivan's The Pirates of Penzance.Vambery left Germany in 1933 when the Nazis came to power. He moved to Paris, where he and Weill (a fellow exile) collaborated on an operetta, Der Kuhhandel (the cattle trade). The work was a failure when it premiered (in London) in 1935, but has since been successfully revived.In 1938 Vambery moved to the United States. He taught in the drama department at Columbia University, where he was associated with the world premiere in 1941 of Paul Bunyan by Benjamin Britten and W. H. Auden. He contributed to publications including Die Weltbühne and The Nation.\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nDrew, David (1990). \"Reflections on the Last Years\". In Kim H. Kowalke (ed.).

His property was later sold to Placido Escudero in 1890. The dam was later enhanced in 1904 using concrete and expanded in 1937 to generate 90 KVA electricity for communities in Quezon, making it the first mini-hydroelectric dam in the Philippines. \nIn 1938, the National Historical Commission of the Philippines declared the dam a historical landmark.\n\n\n=== Present use ===\nThe dam is part of the resort Villa Escudero, which started operations in 1981 and serves as a tourist attraction in Quezon. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Karin Hedvig Viveka Adelswärd, née Lindegren (b. March 17, 1942, Oscar's parish in Stockholm), is a Swedish baroness, linguist and professor emerita in conversation research. Upon her retirement, she worked at the Department of Theme Communication at Linköping University. Adelswärd wrote Svenska Dagbladet's column Språkspalten in 1995–2011 and wrote columns in Östgöta Correspondent.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAdelswärd received her doctorate in 1988. In 1999, she became full professor. Her research concentrates on how people understand and misunderstand each other in conversation. She has analyzed trials, job interviews, negotiations, parent-teacher conferences, interviews with young men seeking armed service, doctor-patient interviews, and stories of various kinds. She has also taken an interest in everyday conversation, so-called private rhetoric.\nIn addition to scientific publications, including some in English, Adelswärd has written several popular science books, e.g., \"Talk, laughter, gossip, and Quarrels\", \"Women's Language and Women's Talk\", and \"Word on the Slide\". She has held seminars and lectures and has been interviewed on radio and newspapers about her research. In several Nordic countries, Viveka Adelswärd has received less attention in academic linguistic contexts.\nIn 2002, a festschrift was published on the occasion of her 60th birthday.\nIn 2005, Viveka Adelswärd received the Swedish Academy's language conservation prize of SEK 50,000 mainly for her studies on conversation. On August 3, 1992, she debuted as a summer host Sommar in Sweden's Radio P1 program. She is a member of the Måltidsakademien in Stockholm, Brukskultur in Åtvidaberg and the Hagdahlsakademien.\nShe is involved in local cultural life in her hometown of Åtvidaberg. She has been chairman of the association Brukskultur where she has written articles about Adelsnäs, part of the Barony Adelswärd – where she formerly lived – among other things. \nViveka Adelswärd is the widow of the  court huntsman (Hovjägmästare), Baron Johan Adelswärd, whom she met when she was 19 and married two years later, and is thus allowed to title herself a baroness – the only one in Sweden. She has three sons. She was, together with her husband, listed as one of the 100 richest persons in Sweden in 1996.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nTalking, laughing, gossiping and arguing, and other things we do when we talk (1991, 1996)\nThe Challenge of Heritage: Mid-Life Thoughts (1993).\nUnderstanding a story - or the story of the moose (1996)\nHome to School Talk (1997)\nWomen's language and women's talk.

        "content": "Yuhaqim Yurzih Bin Dhamar Ali Dharih Bin Karb Il Watar Yahan'am (ca. 50 AD - 95 AD):  King of Sheba and Dhu Raydan.\n\n\n== Life & kingdom ==\nHe assumed the throne of Sheba between 85 AD and approximately 95 AD, succeeding Karb's sister El-Bein III. Two inscriptions were found from the reign of King Yahakim, all dated to the month of Dhul-Midhra in the year 200 AH in the Himyarite calendar, corresponding to July 90 AD. (The two inscriptions are dated: Kh-Jarf an-Naʿīmīya 4,5).\nWe have a number of inscriptions from the period of Jehakim's reign, of which his name is mentioned in 11 inscriptions. At the beginning of his reign, he carried the double title (King of Sheba and Dh Raydan), which was the title given to his brother, father, and grandfather. Then it was changed after that to (King of Sheba), which indicates that his kingdom during a certain period was not extensive and that his authority was diminished. Rather, it was limited to Sheba. . During his reign, his uncle Umdan Yahqab turned and declared himself king of Sheba and Dhu Raydan from his capital, Dhofar Yarim. He was later able to ascend to the throne of Ma’rib for a period. build the Amdan Yahqab Gate in the Awwam Temple, and mint coins in his name in Raydan Palace. Some researchers believe that Amdan Yahqab was king of Dhofar Yarim during the reign of his father, Karb Il Watar Yahnoam I, and that Amdan Yahqab disputed with his nephews Dhamar Ali Dharih after his death, which led to the separation of (Ma’rib and Dhofar) during the reign of Dhamar Ali Dharih’s caliphs, and the conflict manifested itself clearly in Yahqab era.      \nThe text (Ja 644) tells us: about a disobedience carried out by a man from the “Shaddad” tribe, and another man named “Rab Um bin Shams” and other men who joined them and supported their movement. They revolted against their master, “Yahaqim,” the king of Sheba and Dhu Raydan, attacked the Palace of Salhin, entered the palace of the kings and the seat of government, and took hold of it. Then a man named “Aws El,” who was from the Ghaiman tribe and was also its prince, attacked the rebels, defeated them, and expelled them from the palace. It appears that he took them by surprise, thus protecting the palace from harm, and they fled from Ma’rib. It appears from the text that the Shaddad tribe, coming from the highlands, was able to The occupation of Ma'rib and its royal palaces for a period, which indicates the weakness of the state during the time of Yahqam, and the superiority of his uncle Amdan Yahqad in attracting the tribes of the highlands, the most important of which is the Shaddad tribe.The tribe took the title “Shaddad Yahqad,” which is a clear reference to its main role during the reign of King Amdan Yahqad. . In the text (Ja 878) there were information of battles that took place during the days of “Yahqim,” king of Sheba and Dhu Raydan, but the text was damaged and lost in places.\nYahaqim went to war against his uncle Amdan Yahqab, the ruler of Raydan, and, against the followers of Dhu Raydan. He destroyed the villages of Illah, and his forces reached the area of Al-Hadd in Yafa. Ilah is a place mentioned by Abu Muhammad Al-Hamdani in the Himyar cypress. There is also information about of a war launched by Yahaqim against the Raydanian near the Hakar region in Saru Himyar, which included the lands of the Radman tribe, Madhah and beyond, in the year 200 AH in the Himyarite calendar, corresponding to June and July of the year 90 AD. \nThere is a text(Al-Qayli - Bani Mahdi 1)  , as well, which talks  About the building of a house by a man called Thawab under the authority of their master, Ihaqim Yarzah bin Dhammar, Ali Dharih, King of Sheba. Another text (CIH 143), written down by a man from the Bakil tribe, brings the name of the king, Ihaqim. However, parts of the text were damaged, spoiling the meaning.The title Yahaqim was dropped from the text due to breakage or damage.            \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Drs. Irzen Hawer (born in Padang Panjang, West Sumatra, 1960) is an Indonesian novelist and short story writer, currently working as a teacher at a high school in Batipuh, Tanah Datar, West Sumatra. From his hometown, Irzen completed five novels, each around 300 pages, within three years (2009–2011). His first novel, Love in the City of the Porch, was published in 2010, followed by several others, including Prose Love in the City of the Porch (July 2011), Eclipse in the City of the Porch (November 2011), Virtuous Girl (2012), and a religious novel.\n\n\n== Life ==\nAfter completing his secondary education in the science stream, he pursued higher education in Indonesian Language and Literature at the Faculty of Language and Arts, IKIP Padang (now Padang State University). During his university years, he was active in the arts at the Prakarsa Studio of the faculty. He also actively wrote short stories. In a short story writing competition held by Taufiq Ismail's Poetry House in 2010, one of his stories, Lenggang, won first place in the West Sumatra-wide event. The story was later published in a West Sumatran short story anthology titled A Hand Cut on God's Chair in 2011.\nIrzen's desire to write novels began when he attended a Reading, Writing, and Literary Appreciation (MMAS) event at Taufiq Ismail's Poetry House at the end of 2008, which was also attended by Ahmad Tohari, the author of Ronggeng Dukuh Paruk. During the event, Irzen had the opportunity for brief discussions with the renowned author. Subsequently, Irzen felt inspired to write novels and soon after, in 2009, he completed his novel Love in the City of the Porch, which was published in early 2010. The novel received widespread acclaim, quickly making him a well-known figure. The alumnus of the Faculty of Language and Literature Education at IKIP Padang in 1985 has been quite productive, launching five novels since 2009.\nFollowing the publication of his novels, other writers began to emerge in Padang Panjang, including Muhammad Subhan who published the novel Rinai Kabut Singgalang. Unexpectedly, other residents of Padang Panjang also secretly began writing novels, including Berlian Persada, Irzen Hawer's younger sibling. Berlian's novel titled Love's Decree from Heaven was serialized in a local media in West Sumatra and is soon to be published. Not only Berlian Persada, but a student from MAN/MAPK Padang Panjang named Mardhiyan Novita M.Z also completed a novel titled The Red and White Poet, published in Jakarta in 2011. In 2015, one of his short stories titled Ampek Sen was adapted into a film directed by Mevi Rosdian, a young cultural figure from West Sumatra, with a soundtrack composed by Muhammad Jujur.\n\n\n== Works ==\nLove in the City of the Porch (2010)\nProse Love in the City of the Porch (July 2011)\nEclipse in the City of the Porch (November 2011)\nVirtuous Girl (2012)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMember Profile FAM Indonesia: Irzen Hawer (Padang Panjang)\nIrzen Hawer, Padang Panjang, and the Literary Writing Movement\nWriting Seminar for Teachers",

        "content": "Australia's National Research Organisation for Women's Safety (ANROWS) is an independent, not-for-profit Australian company that aims to help to reduce violence against women and children. Its members are all nine governments of Australia (federal, state, and territory). It is responsible for increasing the evidence base of what reduces family violence and supporting people and organisations that contribute to this. It produces a research framework called the Australian National Research Agenda (ANRA).\n\n\n== History ==\nAustralia's National Research Organisation for Women's Safety (ANROWS) was established on 12 February 2013 by the Commonwealth Government along with all state and territory governments of Australia following the first National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children 2010–2022 (known as the National Plan).  It continues to operate under the National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children 2022–2032.\n\n\n== Functions ==\nThe main function of ANROWS is to grow the evidence base of which measures help to reduce or end violence against women and children in Australia. This is stated as \"the promotion of the prevention or control of human behaviour that is harmful or abusive to human beings, specifically the reduction of violence against women and their children\".\nIt also aims to lead national discussion on the topic, set the national research agenda, and disseminate and promote knowledge based on the research, which in turn drives refinements in policy design and practical implementation.\n\n\n== Governance ==\nANROWS is a company limited by guarantee, established under the Corporations Act 2001, and is registered as a harm prevention charity under the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission. It is governed by a board of directors (maximum 10) and operates under a constitution. Sam Mostyn AO was appointed as chair on 3 March 2022, with her term set to end on 2 March 2026. Mostyn takes office as the Governor-General of Australia on 1 July 2024.\nTessa Boyd-Caine, who was inaugural CEO of Health Justice Australia from 2016, and before that head of ACOSS, was appointed CEO of ANROWS from February 2024, following the vacating of the position by Padma Raman PSM (who was appointed executive director of the Office for Women in September 2023) and the temporary stint as Acting CEO by Jane Lloyd.\nIts membership comprises all nine governments of Australia: Commonwealth (federal), along with the governments of the states of New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, and Western Australia; and the territories, Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory.\n\n\n== Location ==\nANROWS office is at 90 Bourke Road, in the Sydney suburb of Alexandria.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nANROWS produces a national research framework called the Australian National Research Agenda (ANRA). The first ANRA was endorsed by all Australian governments and released on 16 May 2014. As of 2024 the current one, released in November 2023, covers the five years from 2023 to 2028. ANRA identifies the evidence needed to end domestic, family and sexual violence, as well as how it should be produced. It is intended to be used by those also involved in growing the evidence base, including researchers, funding bodies, policymakers, survivor advocates, and social impact organisations.\nANROWS conducts and publishes a National Community Attitudes Survey (NCAS). There is a national report as well as one broken down by state and territory. Among other things, NCAS reports on community attitudes towards violence against women. The 2023 report, which surveyed around 20,000 people aged over 16, still showed widespread misunderstanding of the issue. Among other mistaken beliefs, over 40 per cent of respondents believed that women and men are equally responsible for committing acts of domestic violence, and over 30 per cent believed that many women exaggerated or made up stories of violence when fighting custody battles.\nThe organisation also publishes other research findings, which are regularly reported by mainstream media, universities, and specialist outlets.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDomestic violence in Australia\nOur Watch\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Pan minisc' is a sweet from the Basilicata region of Italy, made with grape must, flour, and sugar.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe origin of the name is uncertain: it could mean 'grape bread' or 'mixed bread', and the pronunciation varies depending on the region, as does the name (it is also known as farinata, and in Avigliano and Potenza it is called paparotta). Traditionally associated with the grape harvest, it was an important source of energy for farmers when they had to face strenuous days of work.\n\n\n== Preparation ==\nThe grape must is brought to a boil in a pot over low heat, and once removed from the fire, it is mixed with durum wheat flour, sugar, and spices. Put back on the heat, the mixture is continuously stirred until it thickens. Then, it is spread out on a plate to cool down and, finally, served. Pan minisc' can be enjoyed either as a spoon dessert or cut into small portions and eaten with hands, depending on the desired consistency of the final product.\nIn various variations, both black and white grapes, or both, can be used, resulting in different colours (ranging from pinkish to purplish) and slightly different flavours (either sweeter or more sour). In Avigliano, the grape must is flavoured with cinnamon and/or cloves, while in other areas like Val d'Agri, pine nuts, chestnuts, raisins, or dried figs may be added.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCuisine of Basilicata\nSugoli – similar Italian dessert\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jacquetta Marshall  OBE (7 November 1878 – 28 December 1961) was Lord Mayor of Plymouth in 1950–51. Marshall was the first woman to be Lord Mayor of Plymouth.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJacquetta Hosking was born in St Ive in 1878, the daughter of William Hosking and his wife Maria (née Warrick). She grew up in the village of Pensilva. She was named Jacquetta after a character in a novel.\nShe married Richard Marshall (1876–1949) in 1896. They had two children, a son (Octave Roy) and a daughter (Marcie). Marshall was a suffragette in Plymouth, although in 1950 the Plymouth suffragette Eliza Aitken-Davies suggested that Marshall had been a suffragist rather than a more militant suffragette.\n\n\n== Councillor, Alderman and Lord Mayor ==\nMarshall was an unsuccessful Labour candidate for the St Andrew's Ward in 1924. She was elected as a Councillor for Sutton Ward in 1925.\nMarshall was appointed Alderman in 1950 and Lord Mayor 1950–51. A lightweight robe and a featherless tricorn hat were made for her on her election as Lord Mayor. She only had a telephone installed in her house when she became Lord Mayor. She retired as an Alderman and from the Council in 1961.\nShe was chairman of Moorhaven Hospital Management Committee, vice-chairman of Plymouth, South Devon, and East Cornwall Hospital Management Committee, and a member of the South West Regional Hospital Board. She was awarded the OBE in 1955. Lady Astor was awarded the Freedom of the City in 1959, but the Labour Councillors boycotted the event because the Conservative Councillors had refused to award Marshall the Freedom at the same time.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMarshall died at her daughter's home in Guildford in 1961, aged 85.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nA gold medal in Marshall's name was awarded annually from 1951 to the most outstanding nurse at the Freedom Fields section of the South Devon and East Cornwall Hospital, Plymouth; the £100 cost of the medal was borne by Lady Astor, in acknowledgement of the difficulties of being the first woman to hold any particular office.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On April 9, 2024, Pascal Suleiman, a senior figure in the Christian Lebanese Forces party, was abducted and killed in the area of Byblos, Lebanon. Approximately a day and a half later, his body was found in Syria, sparking outrage among the Christian population in Lebanon, which vented its anger on Syrian refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war to Lebanon for several days.\n\n\n== Background ==\nFrom the years of 2011–2016, there was an influx of over 1.5 million refugees from Syria to the neighboring country of Lebanon. As the numbers of Syrians in Lebanon have grown, so have tensions; the attitude towards reception of Syrians in Lebanon quickly became opposed to. The influx of Syrians into Lebanon has resulted in economic, political, social and religious tensions in Lebanon.\nPascal Suleiman (Arabic: باسكال سليمان) was a Lebanese IT expert that worked for Byblos Bank for 20 years. He was a member of the Lebanese Forces (LF) and was appointed the coordinator of the party in the Byblos District. He was married to Micheline Wehbeh and had three children.\n\n\n== Abduction and killing ==\nOn the afternoon of April 7, 2024, Pascal Suleiman, a coordinator for the Christian Lebanese Forces party in the Byblos area, got into his car after returning from a condolence visit. While driving in a black Audi, he was ambushed and kidnapped by unidentified assailants of Syrian nationality. During his abduction in the assailants car he was able to call one of his party collogue and alerted him of his kidnapping; he was heard through the phone saying \"I have children, don't kill me\" which were his last known words. News got out of his kidnapping and protestors blocked roads demanding a safe return.\nA day and a half later, his body was found by Syrian soldiers in the Hawit area of Syria and video of his corpse circulated online. Suleiman's body was delivered to the Basel al-Assad Hospital in Homs by the Lebanese Red Cross and then transported to Lebanon.\n\n\n== Investigations and reactions ==\nInitially, it was claimed that Hezbollah was behind the abduction, however, the Lebanese security forces argued that a gang of Syrian refugees was responsible. The Lebanese Army arrested three Syrians and a Lebanese mole for questioning and to find the victim's whereabouts. With the cooperation of a unit of the Syrian army, they were able to arrest the four kidnappers of Syrian nationalities including the alleged leader named Bilal Mohammad Dello.\nThe discovery of his body in Syria and the shifting of blame towards the Syrian refugees angered the Christians in Lebanon, who clashed with the refugees in the streets between Jbeil and other places across Lebanon. On April 10, local Christians in Bourj Hammoud, a suburb of Beirut, declared to the Syrian migrants in the area that they must vacate all businesses and apartments in Bourj Hammoud by April 12. The following day, Christians distributed leaflets in the Ashrafieh neighborhood of Beirut, issuing an ultimatum to the Syrian refugees to leave the area by April 12 (the next day).\nFollowing the killing, the Lebanese Interior Minister declared that the presence of Syrians in Lebanon must end, and security forces were instructed to enforce Lebanese law on the Syrian refugees within Lebanon's territory. He even called for the excecution of the murderers.\nDespite investigation findings indicating that Syrian refugees were involved in the killing, participants in Suleiman's body transfer procession from Syria to Lebanon called Hezbollah a \"terrorist organization\". The funeral was held on Friday, April 12, at 1:00 p.m. at the Church of Saint George, Byblos, which was initiated by Maronite patriarch Bechara Boutros al-Rahi. The Lebanese-Christian community called the citizens of Lebanon to unite, and participate in the funeral ceremony in solidarity of his \"martyrdom\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hovlata is an archaeological site within Halamish in the West Bank. It is named after the rocky hill \"Givat Hovlata\".\nThe place was first mentioned by the French traveler Victor Guérin in a description from 1864: \"On a small mountain...there are the remains of a very small village that was destroyed and I was told that it is called Khirbat Hovlata\". The site was later surveyed and restored, and is preserved with the help of Halamish's youth.\nThe site is located on a rocky hill that is not suitable for agricultural cultivation because of the large limestone rock surfaces. Quarries, residential and industrial buildings, cisterns, winepress and rock-cut tombs were found throughout the site. According to the ceramic finds and coins, the site was active from the Hasmonean period to the early Arab period, with its activity peak occurred during the Second Temple period to the early Roman period.\n\n\n== Site location ==\nThe site overlooks the central road, leading from Antipatris (Rosh HaAyin), to Jifna, north of Ramallah. This road, known as 'Ma'ale Gofna', was used in the Roman-Byzantine period as the main road connecting Caesarea to Jerusalem and passed through the Jewish capitals of the district - Timna (Khirbet Tibnah) and Gofna (Jifna).\n\n\n== Archeological findings ==\n\n\n=== Heliston winepress ===\nOn the site there is a large system of rock-cut circles that cannot be found anywhere else in the world. Professor Zohar Amar suggested that this is a one of a kind winepress for the making of Heliston wine (the wine of the sun - sweet wine) in the Roman period. The production method is mentioned in Roman literature, but to this day no archaeological site has been found anywhere in the world that matches the description. Researched agree that the production method refers to the making of sweet wine, a production process that is based on exposure to the sun. The origin is in the Greek word - \"Heliaston\" that means: cooking (passive heating) in the sun or high exposure to sunlight for a long period of time.\n16 circular installations were found on large rock platforms with an average diameter of 2.3 meters, and a depth of up to about 10 centimeters. The surfaces were built with a slight slope, and at the edge of each one there is a pit or a hewn pit (up to 0.75 m in diameter, 0.4 m deep). It seems that the purpose of the pits was to collect liquids from the round surfaces.\nThe wine production method: the grapes are harvested a just before they are ripe, and they are dried in the strong sun inside the round facilities in the rock, being turned over three times a day for a time period of three days. After the grapes were exposed to the sun for two or three days, a small amount of sweet must dripped from them, which flowed into the collection pits. In the second stage, which began on the fourth day, these grapes were squeezed in a press, and in this process a large amount of must was obtained, which was collected in jugs.\n\n\n=== Olive press ===\n\nThe agricultural findings on the sites imply that there was an oil press as certain findings show. The site was active from the Hasmonean period to the early Arab period, with the peak of activity occurring during the Second Temple-early Roman period.\n\n\n=== Lime kiln ===\nThe site is home to a lime kiln, a kiln used to produce lime by burning limestone (calcium carbonate). For the production of lime, the chalk must be burned and reach a temperature of 900 degrees Celsius. If during the burning the oven reaches a temperature higher than 1,000 degrees, the material becomes unusable. The use of lime production has been known since ancient times for construction purposes, bomb production and agricultural uses.\n\n\n=== Mikveh ===\n\nA mikveh was recorded at the site in 2008. It is located in the upper part of the site and includes a small staircase leading to a small, plastered basin.\n\n\n=== Rock-cut tombs ===\nThe site is home to the remains of a monumental tomb with a particularly spacious entrance room whose excavation was stopped, as well as Arcosolium tombs.\n\n\n== Tours ==\n\nThe tour of the Hovlata site begins next to an elaborated sign providing information about the site. A short walk leads to a fork that to left after 3 meters are the remains of a lime kiln. 50 m beyond it is the central area of the site. There are clear remains of an ancient mikveh, a weighing stone, ancient tombs with 2 sections, millstone and remains of winepress.\nNot far is the \"industrial area\" of the settlement where there are many precise circles and small pits next to them. The researchers hypothesize that this place was a production site for Heliston wine, a sweet wine that was pressed in these circles flowed into the pits next to them and was collected there. Near this area there is a pavilion that is used as an explanation spot for tourists.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Bertrand Mani (born 25 May 1997) is a Cameroonian footballer player who plays as a forward for FC Ararat Yerevan in Armenia.\nPlaying for AS Fortuna and Colombe Sportive in the Cameroonian Elite One, Mani was selected for the 2020 African Nations Championship (postponed to 2021) and played three matches. In the 2022 Elite One, Mani reportedly became top goalscorer with 20 goals. Camfoot noted that Enow Nkembe scored as many goals, and thus it was \"surprising\" that Mani received the accolade at the Cameroon Football Federation Awards. Most notably, Mani scored 5 goals in an 8–2 victory over Fauve Azur.\nMani was discovered by South African club Cape Town City, who was on the lookout for a \"number nine\" to replace Kermit Erasmus. He was announced as a new signing in November 2022 and would join after the World Cup in December. Then, Mani scored on his South African Premier Division debut against Royal AM. In January 2023 he received a man-of-the-match award against Chippa United. However, his debut goal would remain his only goal for Cape Town City, and the club decided they would no longer prioritize to have Mani on the foreign player quota. An option to prolong his contract was not exercised.\nIn September 2023 it was announced that Mani joined Ararat Yerevan of the Armenian Premier League.\n\n\n== References ==",

For some years he taught philosophy at the Collège de Boncourt in Paris, while studying medicine. He obtained the doctorate in medicine from the University of Toulouse on 13 April 1586. In 1591 he became a medical practitioner in his native city. In 1617, together with Lazarus Marcquis, he drafted and presented a petition to the city council of Antwerp, signed by eleven other doctors, for the establishment of a Collegium Medicum to regulate the practice of medicine and pharmacy in the city and combat the spread of quack remedies. The first steps towards founding this board were taken by a decision of the city council on 28 April 1620. Its effective functioning began on 12 September 1624, empowered to license and discipline doctors, inspect pharmacies, and examine the competence of surgeons, pharmacists and midwives.\nVereycken retired from medical practice around 1630 and moved to Mechelen, where his son was a councillor of the Great Council. He died in that city on 2 December 1635.\n\n\n== Writings ==\nTractatus de cognitione et conservatione sui (Mechelen, Henry Jaye, 1625; second edition 1633).\n\n\n== References ==",

It is located between the valleys of the Alagnon (in the municipality of Laveissière) and the Santoire (in the municipality of Lavigerie).\n\n\n== Geology ==\nThe Puy de Seycheuse is located in the eastern part of the Cantal stratovolcano, prominently positioned above the Alagnon Valley. Like many nearby summits, such as Puy Bataillouse, Téton de Vénus, and Bec de l'Aigle, it consists of a stack of trachyandesitic lava flows, indicative of the extremely violent phases of activity experienced by the stratovolcano between 8.5 and 6.5 million years ago.\n\n\n== References ==",

He performed twice at the popular London club Boiler Room.\n\n\n== Musical career ==\nMall Grab flirts with skateboarding culture, and his stage name is derived from a slang expression for when someone holds a skate wrong, i.e. \"mall grab\". From an early age, he was fascinated by his parents' records, which featured mostly rock and roll. Over time, he became fascinated by the emerging electronic music, which eventually defined his musical work. He admires the band Turnstile, which is evidenced by the production of the EP SHARE A VIEW, which is composed of remixes of the songs of this hardcore punk group. He has a regular show on Rinse FM radio, where he invites guests from the industry and creates mixes.\nIn 2024, Mall Grab was included in the Coachella lineup.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== 2015 ===\nAll Night Long\nElegy\nAlone EP\n\n\n=== 2016 ===\nLet U Kno\nSun Ra EP\nMenace II Society\nSteel City Dance Discs Volume.1\nI Just Wanna\n\n\n=== 2017 ===\nPool Party\nI'll Be in Paris on Sunday If You're About?\n\n\n=== 2018 ===\nHow the Dogs Chill, Vol. 1\n\n\n=== 2020 ===\nDon't Keep The Fire Burning\nShare a View\nSunflower\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMall Grab discography at Discogs \nMall Grab on SoundCloud",

        "content": "Flueggea leucopyrus is a species of shrub or tree. It primarily grows in wet tropical biomes.It's common names include Indian snowberry, White Honey Shrub, Bushweed or Cool Pot.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nFlueggea leucopyrus is an erect, much-branched shrub up to 5 meters tall with angular branchlets ending in sharp spines. Its leaves are alternate, obovate to elliptic, and measure up to 2.5 x 1.5 cm. Male flowers are greenish-yellow and clustered in axillary fascicles, while female flowers are solitary. The perianth lobes are 5, with 5 free stamens and a disc of 5 glands alternating with the stamens. Fruits are globose, about 5 mm across, 3-celled, and white when ripe. Seeds are trigonous, smooth, and pale brown.\n\n\n== Taxanomy ==\nIn Telugu, it is known as Pulugudu (పులుగుడు) or Tella Pulugudu (తెల్ల పులుగుడు). In Kannada, it is called Bili sooli gida (ಬಿಳಿ ಸೂಳಿ ಗಿಡ) or just Sooli (ಸೂಳಿ). In Tamil, It's names include Varat-pula (வறட்பூலா), Vellai-p-pulanci (ள்ளைப்பூலாஞ்சி), Vellaipoola (வெள்ளை பூலை), Madhuppullaanthi (மதுபிபுல்லாந்தி) or Pulanji (புலஞ்சி). In Malaylam, the names of it include Amboorippachila (അമ്പൂരിപ്പച്ചില), Mulpulanji (മുൾപ്പുല്ലാഞ്ഞി), Perimklavu (പെരിംക്ലാവ്), Vellamullaram (വെള്ളമുള്ളാരം) or Cerimklaav (ചെരിംക്ലാവ്). In Konkani, it is called Parpo. In Sanskrit, it is called Panduphali (पान्डुफली),  Bhuriphali (भूरिफली) or Shwetakambuja (श्वेतकम्बुज). In Marathi, it is called Pandharphali (पांढरफळी). In Sinhala it is called Katupila (කටුපිල).\n\n\n== Range ==\nIt's native range is Ethiopia to Somalia, Socotra, Saudi Arabia (Sajid Island), Pakistan to China (Sichuan, Yunnan), Sri Lanka. Hence, it is native to Bangladesh, China South-Central, Ethiopia, India, Myanmar, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Socotra, Somalia and Sri Lanka.\n\n\n== Habitat and ecology ==\n\nThe flowering period of Flueggea leucopyrus is February to May. While the fruiting period is April to November. It is commonly found on foothills to scrub jungles from the coast to 900m or dry deciduous forests.\n\n\n== Human use and medicinal properties ==\nJuice or paste of the leaves of Flueggea leucopyrus is utilized in conjunction with tobacco to eradicate worms in the sores. It has been used in Ayurveda and folk medicine,especially in Sri Lankan folk medicine where it used in the management of acute and chronic types of wounds. It's fruits are edible and the flowers of it attract honeybees. F.leucopyrus has been found to be antifungal against Aspergillus. S.leucopyrus shows potential anti-inflammatory effects against protein denaturation and proteinase inhibitors, possibly due to flavonoids and polyphenols. Further research is needed to identify active components and their mechanisms of action.\nExtracts from F. leucopyrus possess antioxidant properties, with the most significant effects observed in chloroform and alcoholic extracts. These extracts showed a dose-dependent increase in antioxidant activity, with percentages of 82.5% and 88.42% respectively. Flavanoids, alkaloids, tannins, and steroids present in the extracts are believed to be responsible for this scavenging activity. The order of effectiveness of the extracts was alcohol > chloroform > ethyl acetate > hydroalcohol > hexane. This antioxidant activity was attributed to the reduction of the stable radical DPPH by the chemical constituents of the plant, which act as hydrogen donors. \nThe decoction of aerial parts of F. leucopyrus shows cytotoxic effects on breast cancer cells, particularly Her2 negative ones (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231), compared to Her2 positive (SKBR-3) and non-cancerous cells (MCF-10A). This supports its traditional use for its anticancer properties. \nYoung branches of F.leucopyrus have been used as brooms by the aboriginal inhabitants of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve within the Western Ghats region of India.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Wayde Lekay (born 9 May 1997) is a South African soccer player who plays as a forward for Trollhättan in Sweden.\nHe started his senior career in the Second Division with Tygerberg and Atlantic Nacional. In 2017 he was on trial at Bidvest Wits. He ended up joining SuperSport United and played for their reserves. He moved on to National First Division outfit Steenberg United before joining his first Premier Division club in 2020, TS Galaxy. Stating that his goal for the 2020-21 South African Premier Division was to score 20 goals, he made his first-tier debut in October 2020 and also scored his first goal in that match.\nDuring the summer of 2022, he was on a much-publicized trial with Kaizer Chiefs and also Royal AM, before joining Cape Town City. He played several league games before the World Cup break in late 2022. In the spring of 2023, he was released after Cape Town City brought in Juan Zapata and Bertrand Mani. Lekay first trained with Cape Town Spurs. In the summer of 2023 he went to Sweden, first on trial with Helsingborgs IF, where the manager Stuart Baxter was intimately familiar with South African soccer. Lekay ended up joining FC Trollhättan in the Ettan. There were significant weather and cultural differences in this environment.\n\n\n== References ==",

His father worked with the East Indian Railway Company and was killed in a tiger attack. He was educated at Brighton's Royal Masonic School and played his early rugby with Old Masonians. In World War II, Lewis was badly injured by an anti-personnel mine while serving with the Eighth Army in the Mediterranean. He played football after the war with Swindon Town colts, before returning to rugby.\nA wing-forward, Lewis played most of his rugby at Bath, which he joined from Wells RFC in the 1948–49 season. He became club captain in 1950-51 and also led Somerset in some of his 24 county appearances. From 1952 to 1954, Lewis won 10 England caps, aged 31 on his debut against the Springboks at Twickenham. He played all four matches in England's championship-winning 1953 Five Nations campaign.\nLewis had six years as a national selector and was manager of England's 1972 tour of South Africa, which is where he later settled. He also served as president of both Bath and Somerset.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of England national rugby union players\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAlec Lewis at ESPNscrum\nAlec Lewis at England Rugby",

        "content": "\"H.Y.B.\" (\"Hide Your Bitch\") is a song by American rapper J. Cole from his fourth mixtape Might Delete Later (2024). It features American rapper Bas and British rapper Central Cee. The song was produced by DZL, AzizTheShake and FnZ.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThe song received generally positive reviews. Robin Murray of Clash remarked that Central Cee's \"showstealing appearance on 'H.Y.B.' is a new high water mark for the West London talent, a sign of his blossoming reputation in North America.\" Paul A. Thompson of Pitchfork described the song as \"an exceedingly rare thing, a subtle integration of drill's wobble into a less industrial sound palette.\" Reviewing Might Delete Later for HotNewHipHop, Aron A. wrote that the tracks \"H.Y.B\" and \"Stealth Mode\" are \"prime examples of Cole's ability to find inspiration from the new generation, even outside of the U.S. Bas, who appears on both tracks, pulls J Cole into a hedonistic lifestyle on both tracks that extends the themes of songs like 'Passport Bros.' Central Cee's inclusion on 'H.Y.B' is another heavyweight co-sign for the Brit.\"\nDakota West Foss of Sputnikmusic was critical of the song and stated it shows Drake's influence on J. Cole in a negative manner, writing it \"finds Cole borrowing Aubrey's penchant of culture vulturing to briefly pretend that he's Bri'ish, roight with a bonafide drill song. He says the quiet part out loud when he says 'I keep forgetting I'm J Cole.' Bas and Central Cee make an appearance to lend credibility but I can't tell you if that worked or not because I am frankly too awestruck by Jermaine delivering a strong contender for worst bar of all time:\n\nA-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-M-N-O-P/that's little me in the classroom askin', \"what's L?\"\nCandidly, I have no idea what to say about that.\"\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Tatjana Marković Topalović (Serbian Cyrillic: Татјана Марковић Топаловић; born 24 March 1969) is a Serbian academic and politician. She has served in the National Assembly of Serbia since February 2024 as a member of Serbia Centre (SRCE).\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nMarković Topalović was born in Požarevac, in what was then the Socialist Republic of Serbia in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. She graduated from high school in Šabac and later received a bachelor's degree from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Physics (1996), a master's degree from the University of Novi Sad's Department of Physics (2009), and a Ph.D. from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Physics (2022). Since 2004, she has taught at the \"Dr. Andra Jovanović\" medical school. She has published several expert papers in domestic and international journals. A highly respected teacher, Marković Topalović received a \"Best Educators of Serbia\" award in 2014 and was Serbia's representative at the competition for the Global Teacher Prize in 2019.\n\n\n== Politician ==\nMarković Topalović became president of Serbia Centre's city board for Šabac in June 2023. In October of the same year, she was chosen as a party vice-president.\n\n\n=== Parliamentarian ===\nSerbia Centre contested the 2023 Serbian parliamentary election as part of the Serbia Against Violence (SPN) coalition. Marković Topalović appeared in the twenty-sixth position on the SPN list and was elected when the list won sixty-five mandates. The Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) and its allies won a majority government, and she now serves in opposition with Serbia Centre's assembly group.\nMarković Topalović is a member of the environmental protection committee and the committee on spatial planning, transport, infrastructure, and telecommunications, a deputy member of the committee on the rights of the child, the committee on human and minority rights and gender equality, and the committee on the economy, regional development, trade, tourism, and energy, and a substitute member of Serbia's delegation to the parliamentary dimension of the Central European Initiative.\n\n\n=== City politics of Šabac ===\nMarković Topalović sought to become the list holder for the local Šabac Against Violence coalition in the 2023 local elections, which took place concurrently with the parliamentary election. She was rejected in favour of former mayor Nebojša Zelenović, the leader of Serbia's Together (Zajedno) party. Due to ongoing divisions among Šabac's opposition parties, Serbia Centre ultimately left Šabac Against Violence and contested the local election on a separate list with the People's Movement of Serbia (NPS) and the New Face of Serbia (NLS). Marković Topalović appeared in the lead position and was elected to the city assembly when the list won two mandates.\nThe SNS and its allies won a majority victory in Šabac. Zelenović's coalition later announced a boycott of the assembly, charging that the election had been stolen. Serbia Centre opposes the boycott, and Marković Topalović has participated in the assembly as an opposition member. These events have led to further acrimony among the city's opposition parties and in particular between Marković Topalović and Zelenović.\n\n\n== References ==",

It existed until 1939. \n\n\n== History ==\nIts activity was initially focused around the ice rink on a freezing pond in the middle of the cycling track in Dynasy, but later it was inextricably associated with Swiss Valley at Ul. Chopin. In 1898, WTŁ became a member of the International Skating Union (ISU), thus introducing Polish skating to organized international structures. It also promoted other sports disciplines, including: gymnastics, fencing, tennis, and roller skating.\nIn the years 1894–1896, the members of the society were immortalized in the first ever Polish film made by the inventor and director Kazimierz Prószyński, who recorded a skating rink in Warsaw where they regularly practiced skating.\nWTŁ conducted lively socio-cultural, patriotic, and social activities. The WTŁ premises were one of the most elegant salons in Warsaw. Before 1914, conspiratorial activities were carried out in the WT area.\nIn the years 1905–1908, the vice president, and in 1908, the president of the Warsaw Skating Society was Adolf Daab, an industrialist and councilor of Warsaw.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nEncyklopedia Warszawy, Wydawnictwo Naukowe PWN, Warsaw 1994, p. 935",

However, he had to join the Persib U-20 team competing in Elite Pro Academy 2023–24 Liga 1. With the U-20 team, Adzikry appeared in 17 matches and scored 4 goals. However, Persib U-20's journey in the EPA had to be stopped in the preliminary round even though they had two remaining matches. Maung Ngora only has 17 points and is in fifth place, 7 points behind PSS Sleman U-20 in third place.\nReceiving these results, Adzikry was disappointed. However, the opportunity to train with the main squad under the direction of Bojan Hodak has slowly restored his confidence. Moreover, the players in the main squad also received it well.\nIn the match against Persis Solo 2nd round of 2023–24 Liga 1, Adzikry entered the line-up list for the first time at the main club.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAdzikry Fadlillah on Instagram\nAdzikry Fadlillah at Soccerway",

It is a series of instant noodles with real pieces of beef. This product comes in a variety of flavors.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1983, the first bowl of \"Imperial Big Meal Beef Noodles\" came with a cooking bag. In the 1980s, Uni-President Enterprises Corporation came up with the idea of developing instant noodles with \"conditioning bags\" attached. Although they are now widely available, in the 1980s this was a very rare idea. This inspiration came from the room-temperature cooking bags developed by the United States Army, which used room-temperature sterilization soft bag technology combined with ready-to-eat bag when heated.  The idea was jointly created with the renowned Taiwanese chef Fu Pei-mei, who once said, \"Food should not be the exclusive right of the rich.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\n \nList of instant noodle brands\nList of noodles\nTTL Hua Tiao Chicken Noodles\nWei Lih Men\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Imperial Big Meal at Wikimedia Commons",

It is a robust, dense, spreading shrub that typically grows to a height of up to 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in). The species was first formally described in 2005 by Darren Crayn and Michael Clyde Hislop in Australian Systematic Botany.\nThe specific epithet (synandra) means \"together with males\", referring to the united stamens. \nThis species grows in sand over limestone on ridges, sand dunes and valleys in the Esperance Plains bioregion of Western Australia and is listed as \"Priority One\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions, meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations where it is potentially at risk.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Enigmatic Society is the second extended play by American jazz supergroup Dinner Party. It was released on April 14, 2023, via Sounds Of Crenshaw/Empire Distribution. Recording sessions took place at Organic Grease Studios and Larrabee Sound Studios in Los Angeles and Electric Lady Studios in New York City. Production was handled by members Terrace Martin, 9th Wonder and Robert Glasper, as well as Hi-Tek, Sounwave and Trevor Lawrence Jr. It features guest appearances from Phoelix, Arin Ray, Ant Clemons and Tank.\nThe album debuted at number 17 on the Top Jazz Albums and number 4 on the Top Contemporary Jazz Albums in the United States. It was supported by single \"Insane\" with an accompanying animated music video directed by Juppi Juppsen.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nEnigmatic Society was met with generally favourable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 70 based on five reviews.Robin Murray of Clash praised the album, saying \"finessed and unified, Enigmatic Society is magnificent, a micro-masterpiece that refuses to be pigeonholed. Free-thinking yet direct, it's a salute to collaborative art, and the geniuses behind it\". Kate Hutchinson of The Observer stated: \"while many mainstream acts lean on jazzists to lend some flair, it's rare that it goes the other way. But Dinner Party bring serious chops to contemporary music's top table\". Ben Cardew of Pitchfork resumed: \"the whole is stronger than the sum of its parts\". AllMusic's Andy Kellman found it \"neither as powerful nor as weighty as the debut, and certainly doesn't seem intended to match it in those regards. It's altogether a calmer, more romantic work\".In the mixed review for The Wire, the critic concluded: \"this is pleasant but forgettable music, dissolving the instant it hits the eardrum\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEnigmatic Society at Discogs (list of releases)",

The film shows skaters on the skating rink of the Warsaw Skating Society.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe date of the film's creation is not precisely known. The film has not survived to this day. It was either destroyed or missing. However, descriptions from the Polish press documenting the first film screenings in Poland organized by Kazimierz Prószyński and four film frames reproduced in the Warsaw press have survived.\nThe film was probably made between 1894 and 1896, as indicated by the six holes perforation between the frames  and not, as was later accepted, along the film. This was a characteristic feature of films made by Prószyński with the first version of the cinematographic apparatus called pleograph. Prószyński made a number of improvements and major design changes. In 1896, he modernized the pleograph, adapting it to world standards.\nThe frame format was also non-standard. It measured 45×38 mm and was larger than those later used in the film.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Rigid spine syndrome, also known as congenital muscular dystrophy with rigidity of the spine (CMARS), is a rare and often debilitating neuromuscular disorder. It is characterized by progressive muscle stiffness and rigidity, particularly in the spine, which can severely limit mobility and impact quality of life. This condition is typically present from birth or early childhood and tends to worsen over time.\nDespite its rarity, rigid spine syndrome represents a significant challenge for those affected, as well as for their families and healthcare providers.\n\n\n== Symptoms ==\nRigid spine syndrome is characterized by a range of symptoms that can vary in severity and presentation. Common symptoms of the condition include:\n\n\n=== Muscle stiffness and rigidity ===\nIndividuals with rigid spine syndrome often experience tightness and inflexibility in their muscles, particularly in the spine. This rigidity can make movement difficult and may progress over time.\n\n\n=== Spinal deformities ===\nOne of the hallmark features of rigid spine syndrome is the development of spinal deformities, such as kyphosis (forward curvature of the spine) and scoliosis (sideways curvature of the spine). These deformities can cause pain and further restrict movement.\n\n\n=== Joint contractures ===\nContractures, or permanent tightening of the muscles and tendons around a joint, are common in rigid spine syndrome. This can lead to reduced range of motion and joint deformities.\n\n\n=== Muscle weakness ===\nWhile muscle stiffness is a primary symptom, individuals with rigid spine syndrome may also experience muscle weakness, particularly in the limbs.\n\n\n=== Respiratory complications ===\nIn severe cases, rigid spine syndrome can lead to respiratory complications due to the restriction of chest movement caused by spinal deformities and muscle rigidity.\n\n\n=== Difficulty walking ===\nThe combination of muscle stiffness, joint contractures, and spinal deformities can make walking and other forms of mobility challenging for individuals with rigid spine syndrome.\n\n\n=== Other symptoms ===\nDepending on the severity of the condition, individuals with rigid spine syndrome may also experience fatigue, pain, and difficulty with activities of daily living.\n\n\n== Causing factors ==\nRigid spine syndrome is a genetic disorder, primarily caused by mutations in the SEPN1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called selenoprotein N, which plays a role in muscle function and development. Mutations in the SEPN1 gene can lead to abnormal muscle stiffness and rigidity, as well as other characteristic features of rigid spine syndrome.\nThe inheritance pattern of rigid spine syndrome is autosomal recessive, which means that an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the condition. Individuals who inherit only one copy of the mutated gene are known as carriers and typically do not show any symptoms of the condition.\nIn addition to mutations in the SEPN1 gene, other genetic and environmental factors may also play a role in the development of rigid spine syndrome. However, further research is needed to fully understand these factors and their contribution to the condition.\n\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nDiagnosing rigid spine syndrome can be challenging due to its rarity and the variability of symptoms among affected individuals. However, the following approaches are commonly used to diagnose the condition:\n\n\n=== Clinical evaluation ===\nA thorough physical examination is often the first step in diagnosing rigid spine syndrome. The healthcare provider will assess the patient's muscle tone, range of motion, and any signs of spinal deformities or joint contractures.\n\n\n=== Imaging studies ===\nX-rays, CT scans, or MRI scans may be used to evaluate the spine for any abnormalities, such as kyphosis, scoliosis, or other spinal deformities. These imaging studies can also help assess the severity of the condition and guide treatment planning.\n\n\n=== Genetic testing ===\nGenetic testing is essential for confirming a diagnosis of rigid spine syndrome. Testing typically involves analyzing the SEPN1 gene for mutations. Identifying mutations in this gene can help confirm the diagnosis and provide valuable information about the genetic basis of the condition.\n\n\n=== Muscle biopsy ===\nIn some cases, a muscle biopsy may be recommended to evaluate the structure and function of the muscles. This can help differentiate rigid spine syndrome from other muscle disorders and provide additional information about the underlying cause of the condition.\n\n\n=== Electromyography (EMG) ===\nEMG may be used to assess the electrical activity of the muscles and nerves. This test can help identify abnormalities in muscle function and may be used to support a diagnosis of rigid spine syndrome.\n\n\n=== Family history ===\nA detailed family history can also be helpful in diagnosing rigid spine syndrome, as it is an autosomal recessive condition and often runs in families.\n\n\n== Prognosis ==\nThe prognosis of rigid spine syndrome is variable and can be influenced by several factors, including the severity of symptoms, the age of onset, and the effectiveness of treatment. In general, the condition is progressive, meaning that symptoms tend to worsen over time. However, the rate of progression can vary widely among affected individuals.\n\n\n=== Severity of symptoms ===\nThe severity of symptoms at the time of diagnosis can have a significant impact on prognosis. Individuals with milder symptoms may experience slower progression of the condition and better overall outcomes compared to those with more severe symptoms.\n\n\n=== Age of onset ===\nThe age at which symptoms of rigid spine syndrome first appear can also influence prognosis. Early onset of symptoms, particularly in infancy or early childhood, is often associated with a more severe form of the condition and a poorer prognosis.\n\n\n=== Effectiveness of treatment ===\nThe effectiveness of treatment in managing symptoms and complications of rigid spine syndrome can greatly impact prognosis. Early and aggressive management, including physical therapy, orthopedic interventions, and respiratory support, can help improve quality of life and slow disease progression.\n\n\n=== Complications ===\nThe development of complications, such as respiratory problems or severe joint contractures, can also affect prognosis. Complications may require additional interventions and can further impact mobility and overall health.\n\n\n=== Individual response to treatment ===\nEach individual responds differently to treatment, and the effectiveness of various interventions can vary. Regular monitoring and adjustments to the treatment plan are essential to managing the condition and optimizing outcomes.\n\n\n=== Quality of life ===\nDespite the progressive nature of rigid spine syndrome, many individuals are able to maintain a good quality of life with appropriate care and support. Access to multidisciplinary care and assistive devices can greatly improve mobility and independence.\n\n\n== Epidemiology ==\nRigid spine syndrome is a rare neuromuscular disorder, and accurate epidemiological data is limited. However, the condition appears to be extremely rare, with only a few dozen cases reported in medical literature.\n\n\n=== Prevalence ===\nThe exact prevalence of rigid spine syndrome is unknown, but it is believed to be very low. The condition has been reported in various populations worldwide, suggesting that it is not limited to any specific ethnic or geographic group.\n\n\n=== Incidence ===\nSimilarly, the incidence of rigid spine syndrome is not well-established due to its rarity. The condition is typically diagnosed in infancy or early childhood, but cases of adult onset have also been reported, albeit rarely.\n\n\n=== Age and gender distribution ===\nRigid spine syndrome can affect individuals of any age or gender, but it is most commonly diagnosed in childhood. The condition does not appear to have a significant gender bias, affecting males and females equally.\n\n\n=== Geographic distribution ===\nRigid spine syndrome has been reported in various countries around the world, indicating that it is not limited to any specific geographic region. However, due to its rarity, there may be underreporting in some areas.\n\n\n=== Genetic factors ===\nThe autosomal recessive inheritance pattern of rigid spine syndrome suggests that individuals with a family history of the condition are at increased risk. Genetic counseling and testing can help identify carriers and inform family planning decisions.\n\n\n== Research & future directions ==\nResearch on rigid spine syndrome is ongoing, with a focus on understanding the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms of the condition, developing new treatment approaches, and improving the quality of life for affected individuals. Some key areas of research include:\n\n\n=== Genetic studies ===\nResearchers are conducting genetic studies to identify additional genes that may be involved in the development of rigid spine syndrome. This research may lead to a better understanding of the condition's genetic basis and the development of targeted therapies.\n\n\n=== Molecular mechanisms ===\nStudies are underway to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying muscle stiffness and rigidity in rigid spine syndrome. This research may uncover new targets for therapeutic interventions aimed at improving muscle function.\n\n\n=== Clinical trials ===\nClinical trials are being conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of potential treatments for rigid spine syndrome. These trials may involve medications, physical therapies, or surgical interventions aimed at improving mobility and quality of life for affected individuals.\n\n\n=== Regenerative medicine ===\nSome researchers are exploring the use of regenerative medicine approaches, such as stem cell therapy, to repair damaged muscles and improve muscle function in individuals with rigid spine syndrome. This area of research holds promise for future treatment options.\n\n\n=== Patient registries ===\nPatient registries are being established to collect data on individuals with rigid spine syndrome, including information on symptoms, disease progression, and treatment outcomes. These registries are valuable resources for researchers studying the condition.\n\n\n=== Collaborative research efforts ===\nCollaborative research efforts among healthcare providers, researchers, and patient advocacy groups are essential for advancing our understanding of rigid spine syndrome. These collaborations can help facilitate the sharing of data and resources, leading to more rapid progress in the field.\n\n\n=== Future directions ===\nFuture research in rigid spine syndrome is likely to focus on personalized medicine approaches, aimed at tailoring treatments to the specific genetic and molecular characteristics of individual patients. Additionally, research may continue to explore the role of environmental factors in the development and progression of the condition.\n\n\n== Notable cases ==\n\n\n=== 1.

        "content": "Atygay (Kazakh: Атығай; Russian: Атыгай) is a salt lake in the Ekibastuz City Administration, Pavlodar Region, Kazakhstan.\nAtygay is one of the main lakes surrounding Ekibastuz and is located 6.5 kilometers (4.0 mi) to the ENE of the city. The lake is part of the Irtysh Water Management Basin. Atygay village lies 4 kilometers (2.5 mi) to the west of its western shore. \n\n\n== Geography ==\nAtygay is an endorheic lake in the Irtysh Basin. It stretches from WSW to ENE for roughly 6 kilometers (3.7 mi). Larger lake Karasor lies 15 kilometers (9.3 mi) to the NNE, Zhyngyldy 15 kilometers (9.3 mi) to the northwest, Kudaikol 23 kilometers (14 mi) to the northeast, and Angren 17 kilometers (11 mi) to the south.\nAtygay is fed by snow and rain. It usually freezes in November and thaws in April.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nAtygay is a natural salt lake that is used as an evaporation reservoir for the wastewater of Ekibastuz city. The polluted water drains through a ditch from a small lake located 2 kilometers (1.2 mi) to the NW where the solid waste settles. Lake Atygay has fish, such as perch, that reach big sizes and attract fishermen. Authorities warn everyone fishing in the lake about consuming the fish caught in its waters owing to the high concentration of toxic substances.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBylkyldak (lake)\nList of lakes of Kazakhstan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Atygay (lake) at Wikimedia Commons",

Yan Yinhong is a Chinese feminist artist who held a solo exhibition at the China Art Museum during her student years in the 1980s. In the early 1990s, she joined the Yuanmingyuan Artists Village and settled in Beijing. She was born in April 1967 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, with ancestral roots in Taizhou, Zhejiang. She excels in ink painting and focuses on oil painting, performance art, installation, influence, and drama. Among her artworks, she is most famous for her performance art \"One Person's Battlefield\" because she was sexually harassed during the performance.\n\n\n== Contents ==\nIntroduction\nBiography \nExhibition\nArtworks\nFamily\nSee also\nBibliography\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n== Exhibition ==\n\n\n== Artworks ==\n\n\n== Family ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nTwitter:The last post was in 2009 and most of the links she shares are unavailable now. https://twitter.com/yinhong\nBlog: The blog has a collection of her artwork and personal posts.

        "content": "Stortorget (transl. \"The Main Square\", lit. \"The Big Square\") is a square in Malmö. Construction began in 1538 with the demolition of The Monastery of the Holy Spirit (Heligandsklostret), which with its cemetery occupied about 70% of the area of the future square. A note in 1542 refers to the site as thet ny torg (\"the new square\"). The stately Malmö Town Hall (Rådhuset), the largest of its kind in the Nordic countries at the time, located on the eastern side of the square, was inaugurated in 1547.\nAt Stortorget are The Governor's Residence, Malmö Town Hall, Jørgen Kock's House, the Kramer Hotel, and The Lion Pharmacy (Apoteket Lejonet). In the middle of the square stands an equestrian statue of King Charles X Gustav, sculpted by John Börjeson and created in connection with the Craft and Industry Exhibition in Malmö in 1896. The statue was initiated by the newspaperman and politician Carl Herslow and the history professor Martin Weibull.\nStortorget has historically been Malmö's most central square, but with the electrification of the tramway, this role was increasingly taken over by Gustav Adolf's square. Stortorget was served by horsecars in 1887–1907, horse-drawn buses in 1898-1907 and electric trams in 1906–1957.\nJust southwest of Stortorget is Lilla torg, and about 250 m straight south (along Södergatan) is Gustav Adolfs torg.\nAs a curiosity, the meridian 13° east passes through Stortorget, which means that its mean solar time is exactly (if you are standing in the right place) eight minutes behind Central European Time (i.e. Swedish Standard Time).\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Solar System belts are asteroid and comet belts that orbit the Sun in the Solar System in interplanetary space. The Solar System as both major and minor asteroid and comet belts in the inner Solar System. The Solar System is unique in that it has multiple belts. The observation of other planetary systems has found these systems to have no asteroid belts or one vast asteroid belt. The stars Fomalhaut, HD 69830 and Epsilon Eridani are examples of systems with one large asteroid belt. The Solar System belts size and placement are mostly a result of the Solar System having four gas giant planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune far from the sun. The gas giant planets must be in the correct place, not too close or too far from the sun for a system to have Solar System belts.\n\n\n== Formation ==\n\nThe Solar System belts were formed in the formation and evolution of the Solar System. The Grand tack hypothesis is the theory of the unique placement of the gas giants and the Solar System belts. Most gas giant planets found outside our Solar System, exoplanets, are inside the snow line, and are called Hot Jupiters. Thus in normal planetary systems gas giants form beyond snow line and then migrated towards the star. A small percent of gas giants migrate far from the star. In both types of migrations, the Solar System belts are lost in these planetary migrations. The Grand tack hypothesis explains how in the Solar System gas giants migrated in unique way to form the Solar System belts and near circular orbit of planets around the Sun. The Solar System's belts are one key parameters for a Solar System that can support complex life, as circular orbits are a parameter needed for the Habitable zone for complex life.\n\n\n== Solar System belts ==\nThe asteroid and comet belts orbit the Sun from the inner rocky planets into outer parts of the Solar System, interstellar space. An astronomical unit, or AU, is the distance from Earth to the Sun, which is approximately 150 billion meters (93 million miles).

        "revision_id": 1218378533,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The NTV Affair (Russian: Дело НТВ, romanized: Delo NTV) was a campaign of harassment against and a hostile takeover of the independent NTV television network by Gazprom and the government of Russia, lasting from the May 2000 raid on its offices by the Federal Tax Police Service and its 14 April 2001 buyout by Gazprom-Media, the media arm of Gazprom. The campaign has been widely described as politically motivated, with the intention of cracking down on opposition to Vladimir Putin in Russia and independent media. As a result of the buyout, media freedom in Russia substantially decreased.\n\n\n== Background ==\nNTV was founded in 1993 by Russian oligarch Vladimir Gusinsky as part of the \"Media-MOST\" media grouping, also including daily newspaper Segodnya, newsweekly Itogi and the Echo of Moscow radio station. From its early days, NTV became notable for its independent news coverage, particularly on the First Chechen War. NTV's coverage of the war brought public attention in Russia to atrocities committed by the Russian military in Chechnya, ultimately driving public opposition to the war.\nAfter the 1998 Russian financial crisis Media-MOST amassed a significant amount of debt, and was forced to postpone its initial public offering as a result of the crisis. According to journalist Gregory Feifer, individuals describing the NTV Affair and campaign against Media-MOST as being non-political in nature have frequently cited this debt as a reason for the affair. Feifer, however, has rejected this claim, saying that \"finances are hardly ever the explanation in Moscow — unless they have something to do with politics.\"\nDuring the 1999 Russian legislative election NTV actively supported Yury Luzhkov, Mayor of Moscow and leader of the Fatherland – All Russia, who was one of the strongest opponents of President Boris Yeltsin and the pro-Yeltsin Unity party as well as a longtime supporter of Gusinsky. This brought it into a conflict with Public Russian Television, owned by Boris Berezovsky, which supported Yeltsin and Unity. Luzhkov's resounding defeat in the election, the appointment of security officer Vladimir Putin as Prime Minister, and the beginning of the Second Chechen War, resulted in increased pressure from Gazprom on NTV regarding the latter company's debts.\nOne of the most popular shows on NTV during the late 1990s and early 2000s was Puppets (Russian: Куклы, romanized: Kukly), a satirical comedy depicting Russian politics in a negative light. Puppets' portrayal of Putin particularly incensed the leader, and several individuals, including Gusinsky and independent media outlet The Moscow Times have cited the show as one of Putin's strongest grievances against NTV.\nShortly after Putin's victory in the 2000 Russian presidential election plans began to be drawn up to bring an end to NTV. Gleb Pavlovsky, an adviser to the Russian government, later admitted to having led efforts to crack down on NTV and Media-MOST from 1999 at Berezovsky's request.\n\n\n== Police raid on NTV headquarters (2000) ==\nOn 11 May 2000, four days after Putin's inauguration as president, armed officers of the Federal Tax Police Service raided NTV's Moscow headquarters. The raid, which lasted 12 hours, was claimed by the Federal Tax Police Service and the Federal Security Service (FSB) as having been part of a broader investigation into Media-MOST which was unrelated to politics. Initially, the FSB claimed that it was a financial investigation, before later changing its story and saying that it was in response to illegal wiretaps. Gusinsky, however, rejected the government's claims, as did opposition politicians Grigory Yavlinsky (from the liberal Yabloko party) and Gennady Zyuganov (from the Communist Party of the Russian Federation).\nFollowing the raid on NTV's headquarters, Gusinsky was charged with stealing $10 million in a privatisation deal and arrested. He subsequently fled to Spain.\nFollowing the raid and Gusinsky's arrest, pressure on NTV further increased. A note from the Kremlin to NTV staff demanded that Putin's puppet be removed from Puppets, that the network stop criticising the Second Chechen War, and that attacks on member's of Yeltsin's inner circle cease. As a result of the pressure, Putin's puppet was temporarily removed from Puppets, with NTV Director-General Yevgeny Kiselyov commenting that \"Because someone at the top is upset by the presence of a rubber puppet representing Mr Putin on the show, we decided to experiment by having one show without the Putin puppet.\" However, the show defiantly continued to mock Putin, with a skit portraying Chief of Staff Aleksandr Voloshin as Moses bringing down the edicts of God (Putin), who people were forbidden from seeing or naming.\nOn 12 June 2000 Alfred Koch was appointed as head of Gazprom-Media, the media wing of Gazprom. According to professor Cécile Vaissié, Koch's appointment was done with the understanding that he would participate in the impending takeover of NTV. Mikhail Lesin, Minister of Press and Mass Media, publicly stepped away from the case afterwards, in an effort to lend more credibility to the claim that the takeover was non-political. Igor Malashenko, NTV's Managing Director, proposed a deal by which Gazprom would buy Media-MOST for $300 million; this was equal to the group's claimed profits minus the debts owed to Gazprom. The subsequent events remain unclear, but a paper titled \"annex number 6\", guaranteeing Gusinsky's freedom if he agreed to sell the company, was drafted and later agreed to by Koch, Lesin, and Gusinsky, leading to the latter's release.\nRaids on NTV's offices continued into 2001. Amid the impending buyout, CNN founder and American media mogul Ted Turner emerged as a potential saviour for the network. Turner offered to buy out the network for $300 million, enough to pay reported debts to Credit Suisse First Boston and pay off a 19% share in NTV's stock demanded by Gazprom which would have given it majority control. Koch disputed claims from NTV's staff that Gazprom's demanded shares would lead to a takeover of the network, insisting that he would sell it per a 17 November 2000 agreement to sell the shares to Deutsche Bank, and accused Gusinsky of negotiating with Turner behind the backs of Gazprom negotiators.\nOn 25 January 2001 Gazprom-Media was granted control over the 19% of shares in NTV per a decision by a Moscow court. Koch announced his attention to replace the board, promising to maintain the network's management. However, four days after the decision, Kiselyov announced that Putin had written a letter to the NTV staff supporting Turner's purchase of 25% of stock. The same day, Hungarian-American investor George Soros stated that he was also involved in Turner's effort to stop the buyout. Ultimately, Putin refused to give guarantees against political interference into NTV, leading Turner to abandon his operation.\n\n\n== \"Save NTV\" protests ==\n\nIn response to the impending buyout of NTV, liberal politicians Sergei Yushenkov, Boris Nemtsov, and Irina Khakamada of the Union of Right Forces, joined by Yavlinsky and the Union of Journalists of Russia, organised protests under the name of \"Save NTV\" (Russian: Захват НТВ, romanized: Zakhvat NTV) to draw attention to the network's plight in an effort to save it.\nThe first protests took place on 31 March 2001. The number of protesters present has been counted at between 8,000 and 20,000. Later protests were met with solidarity in other cities, such as Saint Petersburg. Kiselyov emerged as the face of the protests, leading speeches to supporters in Moscow. His 3 April removal as Director-General, performed by Gazprom after calling a shareholders' meeting, was publicly opposed by NTV's staff, which vowed to support him.\nAmong the Russian intelligentsia, opposition to the buyout was massive. Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, appointed as head of NTV's advisory council on 17 May 2000, publicly denounced efforts against the network and appealed to the Russian people by saying \"The people need a free press.\" An open letter by 122 Russian public figures was also published in Komsomolskaya Pravda and Moskovskaya Pravda in opposition to the planned takeover. It was also condemned by the United States and Germany.\n\n\n== Capture of NTV headquarters ==\nIn spite of Gazprom's majority stake in NTV, the network's employees initially refused to accept the takeover after the 3 April vote that led to changes in board membership. On the morning of 14 April, employees travelling to the network's headquarters found the building guarded by an armed security force. They were barred from entering the building unless they signed a letter in support of the new leadership. Anchor Andrey Norkin was cut off amidst a broadcast at 8:06, being replaced by a pro-Gazprom journalist later that morning. In response to the capture, 25 members of the network's 50-person editorial staff resigned to move to the smaller TNT.\nBoris Dobrodeev, formerly an NTV journalist, resigned his position as head of the state-run RTR to return to work at NTV. American investor Boris Jordan was installed as Director-General. Jordan's instatement caused protests from the Communist Party, with Zyuganov lamenting \"In which other European country would it be possible for a foreigner to lead a nationwide television channel?\" and Chairman of the State Duma Gennadiy Seleznyov proclaiming that he \"could not imagine a more inept decision\" than hiring \"shady figures\" Koch and Jordan.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe NTV Affair led to the end of the only independent news network in Russia, and has since been described by the BBC as a watershed moment in the history of Russia under Vladimir Putin and Russia's press. Scriptwriter Viktor Shenderovich has argued that the takeover marked a beginning of the \"strangulation\" of Russian media, while Echo of Moscow commentator Sergey Parkhomenko has blamed the events for resulting in the beginning of self-censorship in Russia.\nIgor Yakovenko, former head of the Union of Journalists of Russia, has blamed the NTV Affair for resulting in a loss of interest in news among Russians. Kiselyov has also claimed that the takeover led to the emergence of the phrase \"\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Scènes de la vie privée et publique des animaux (1842) was an illustrated work of French parody published in the aftermath of the French Revolution. First published completely in 1842, with some parts coming as early as November 20, 1840, it was produced by \"P. J. Stahl\" (Pierre-Jules Hetzel) in collaboration with Honore de Balzac, Antoine Gustave Droz , Émile Lemoine, Jules Janin, Georges Sand, Charles Nodier, Marie Mennessier-Nodier, and Alfred de Musset; and illustrated by J. J. Grandville (Jean Ignace Isidore Gérard), it proved to be best-seller, selling 25,000 copies. Several editions were later published with the title altered as La Vie Privée Et Publique Des Animaux (1867) and Les Animaux peints par eux-mêmes et dessinés par un autre (The Animals Painted by Themselves and Drawn by Another). An English translation Public and Private Lives of Animals (1876) was produced by J. Thompson. \n\n\n== History and overview ==\nHetzel's wrote to the collaborating authors indicating that all texts were to be in the first person of an animal narrator. In the first volume the apologues have a preface by Hetzel. The second volume begins with a call for another revolution. The book begins when the animals decide to end human tyranny and form a parliament at the Jardin des Plantes in Paris. The Jardin had become a place of great public interaction in the 1840s. In the various stories storks personified free and harmonious people while the wolves (of Ukraine) were considered as being strictly egalitarian. Many of the essays examine the quest for better governance and society with animals being models.The chapter layout and authorship (titles translated) are:\n\n\n=== Volume 1 ===\nP.-J.

Stahl, Last chapter.The chapter \"Voyage d'un Moineau de Paris à la Recherche du Meilleur Gouvernement\" (\"The Flight of a Parisian Bird in Search of a Better Government\") begins with a youthful French sparrow which has a comfortable life thanks to grains grown by humans visiting other parts of the world and wonders why sparrows do not have a good social organization unlike the ducks and crows. The first society he visits is the empire of the ants (Britain).The book was a great success and sold 25,000 copies which annoyed Balzac. He considered it a stupid work that sold only because of its pictures.  Grandville received 18,000 francs for the work while Balzac had received 15,000 for La Comedie humaine and only 1,200 francs for his Scenes de la vie privée (1830).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPublic and Private Lives of Animals (1877)\nScènes de la vie privée et publique des animaux : études de moeurs contemporaines.

        "content": "Goodenia discophora, commonly known as cabbage poison, is a species of flowering plant in the Goodeniaceae family and is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It is a herb with lyre-shaped, pinnatifid leaves and yellow flowers.\n\n\n== Description ==\nGoodenia discophora is a glabrous herb with lance-shaped leaves, the narrower end towards the base or lyre-shaped pinnatifid leaves up to 200 mm (7.9 in) long and up to 50 mm (2.0 in) wide. The flowers are borne on a more or less erect flowering stem up to 800 mm (31 in) long with bracteoles joined, forming a funnel up to 50 mm (2.0 in) wide. The sepals are joined at the base to form a short tube, the lower lobes up to 5–6 mm (0.20–0.24 in) long. The petals are yellow, 10–13 mm (0.39–0.51 in) long with wings 1–2 mm (0.039–0.079 in) wide. Flowering mainly occurs from September to February, and the capsule is oval and contains more or less spherical seeds about 4 mm (0.16 in) in diameter with a wing about 1 mm (0.039 in) wide.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThis species was first formally described in 1876 by Ferdinand von Mueller who gave it the name Velleia discophora in his Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae, from a specimen collected by Jess Young \"near Ularing\". In 2020, Kelly Anne Shepherd and others transferred it to the genus Goodenia, based on  nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondrial data. The specific epithet (discophora) means \"bearing a round plate\", referring to the large, round bracts.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nGoodenia discophora grows in sandy and gravelly soils, often appearing after fire in southern Western Australia in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Geraldton Sandplains, Mallee, Murchison and Yalgoo bioregions of Western Australia.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nCabbage poison is listed as \"not threatened\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.\n\n\n== References ==",

It received positive reviews from critics.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nIms Taylor of DIY called it \"ethereal, exploratory, and unexpected\", calling it \"a bitesize promise of exciting things to come\". Taylor also found that \"moody guitar meanderings and offbeat vocal musings are English Teacher's weapons of choice\". The Line of Best Fit's Kieran Macadie summarised it as \"a solid body of work from a fresh young band that intend to make their mark on music – filled with absurdist humour, orbiting guitar riffs and punchy melody\".\nReviewing the EP for NME, Sophie Williams called the five tracks \"punchy, melodic songs [that] unite nervy, whirlpooling guitars with cutting takedowns of the day-to-day (laborious supermarket trips, hangovers, dodgy dates). It makes for a deliciously sour debut EP, set to a soundtrack of restless art-punk\". Eddie Smith of Beats Per Minute wrote that the band's \"haunting arpeggios lurch into a capricious mix of poetry, bass riffs and guitar stabs, making for an exhilarating 16 minutes\" with \"math rock volatility\" and \"overt indie pop moments present\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

He writes \"This beautifully made film is inspirational in its positive depiction of the education process, the hard work and dedication of students and teachers alike, and in an event that surely will have a permanent impact on all the girls involved.\" Writing in The Age, Jake Wilson gave it 4/5 saying it \"transcends its 'inspirational' format to rank as the best Australian film so far this year.\" SBS's Don Groves gave it 3 1/2 stars noting \"The result is an illuminating, fly-on-wall study of the struggles, hard work, personal dramas, tears and triumphs involved in the challenging project.\" Ben McEachen of the Herald Sun gave it 3 1/2 stars and states \"Connolly and Raymond provide such a sound overview of the rehearsal process that, by The Big Night, you will be suitably appreciative of what Carey, her staff and students have achieved.\" Leigh Paatsch, also of the Herald Sun, gave it 2 stars finishing \"To be perfectly fair, Mrs Carey's Concert is a well-intentioned film about a small part of our much-maligned education sector working as it should.

        "content": "Jerome Crystal, better known by his nickname Doc, is a fictional character from Jim Henson's television series Fraggle Rock. He is the only major human character on the show, as well as the only character to appear in all 96 episodes of the series.\nDoc is an elderly inventor and tinkerer who loves to build strange contraptions. He lives with his dog, Sprocket, in a workshop that contains a hole leading to into Fraggle Rock, the home of the Fraggles. Doc does not know about the Fraggles at the start of the series, though he later learns about their existence.\nDoc was played by Irish-Canadian actor Gerard Parkes in the original series, as well as in the 1987 TV special A Muppet Family Christmas. Several other actors played variants of Doc in the international versions of Fraggle Rock. A similar character, also named Doc, appears in the reboot Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock, played by Lilli Cooper.\n\n\n== Character biography and storylines ==\nDoc first appears in \"Beginnings\", the first episode of Fraggle Rock. The episode involves Doc discovering an old room in his house and converting it into a workshop to work on his inventions. In the same episode, the Fraggle Uncle Traveling Matt, an explorer, discovers a hole that leads into Doc's workshop, and uses it to leave Fraggle Rock and journey into \"Outer Space\", aka the human world. Uncle Traveling Matt regularly sends postcards to his nephew Gobo, who must venture into Doc's workshop to retrieve them.\nDoc is highly enthusiastic about his work, though his inventions tend to malfunction or to work strangely. He loves his dog, Sprocket, who is highly intelligent and knows about the existence of the Fraggles. Doc does not know about the Fraggles at first, despite Sprocket's many attempts to tell him. Doc has a rivalry with his neighbor, the never-seen Ned Shimmelfinney, though he does value Ned as a friend. Halfway through the series, Doc takes a job at the Captain's Inn, an inn that opens near his home, and develops a crush on its' owner, Ms. Ardath.\nDoc first begins to realize the existence of the Fraggles in the episode \"The River of Life\". In the episode, Doc is offered $100,000 to allow engineers to use the caves underneath the workshop as a waste-disposal site. The toxic water poisons the Fraggles, and the only unaffected Fraggle, Boober, goes into Outer Space to beg Doc to cease the contamination. Although Doc is not home at the time, Boober leaves a stack of Gobo's postcards, bound together with moss, which Doc notices, and realizes that something may be living underneath his home. He cancels the contract, saving the Fraggles.\nDoc finally meets Gobo and learns about the Fraggles in the penultimate episode, \"The Honk of Honks\". In the episode, Doc learns that his best friend, Ned Shimmelfinney, needs to move away for his health, and is devastated at the thought of losing his friend. Gobo, entering Outer Space at the time, meets Doc and comforts him. In the final episode, \"Change of Address\", Doc moves to the desert to be with Ned. However, the Fraggles discover a new cave in the Rock that leads right into Doc's new apartment, and they reunite with him as the series ends. It is in this episode that we learn Doc's real name, Jerome Crystal.\nDoc also appears in the television special A Muppet Family Christmas, in which he rents the house of Fozzie Bear's mother to stay for Christmas with Sprocket. He appears alongside many other characters from Fraggle Rock, the Muppets, and Sesame Street. Although produced after the conclusion of Fraggle Rock, the special appears to take place before the final few episodes, as Doc still does not know about the Fraggles in it.\n\n\n== Alternate versions ==\nSeveral different actors portrayed variants of Doc in the international versions of Fraggle Rock. In the British inserts, Doc was replaced with a character named The Captain, portrayed by Fulton Mackay. The Captain is a retired sailor who lives in a lighthouse with Sprocket, the lighthouse containing the entrance to Fraggle Rock. Following Mackay's death in 1987, he was replaced with John Gordon Sinclair as P.K. (short for \"Principal Keeper\"), the Captain's nephew. Following Sinclair's departure, Simon O'Brien played B.J. (son of the lighthouse's owner, Bertwhistle) in the fourth and final season. In the French version of the series, the wraparound segments took place in a bakery, with Michel Robin playing a baker version of Doc. Sprocket was renamed Croquette for this version. In the German version of Fraggle Rock, Hans-Helmut Dickow played Doc. The German versions of the wraparound segments were the same as the American segments, but re-filmed in German.\nIn the animated series, John Stephenson voiced Doc. The animated version of Doc differed from the original in that he was only seen from the neck down, recalling Nanny from Muppet Babies, another animated adaptation of a Jim Henson series.\n\n\n=== Reboot ===\n\nOwing to Gerard Parkes's death in 2014, Doc does not appear in the 2022 reboot series, Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock. Doc was replaced by another character also named Doc. This character differs greatly from the original Doc, being a younger woman of African-American descent. Lilli Cooper plays the character. This version is a young grad student working on her doctorate in marine ecosystems. She lives in a backhouse owned by Mrs. Shimmelfinney (the similarly unseen counterpart to Ned Shimmelfinney), and is still the owner of Sprocket.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "My Next Life was a planned studio album by Canadian country music artist Terri Clark, intended to be released in August 2007 through BNA Records. The ultimately shelved project was produced by Garth Fundis.\nTwo singles were released from the recording sessions, with \"Dirty Girl\" and \"In My Next Life\" charting in Canada and the US. Clark left BNA in November 2008 to become an independent artist and focus on the Canadian market. She re-recorded some of the songs for her next album, The Long Way Home (2009).\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn March 2006, Terri Clark announced on her website that she departed ways with Mercury Nashville, the label that she had been with since her album Terri Clark was released in 1995. By June of that same year, it was announced that Clark had signed a record deal with BNA Records, a record label known for housing acts such as Kenny Chesney and Lonestar. In this same press interview, it was also announced her first album with the label would be released in 2007. Clark worked with producer Garth Fundis.\nThe project included a song titled \"Nashville Girls\", which featured country music artists Martina McBride, Sara Evans, and Reba McEntire.\n\n\n== Singles ==\n\"Dirty Girl\" was released as the lead single from the scrapped album on April 2, 2007, to country radio before receiving a digital release on April 24. The song was written by Tom Shapiro and Rivers Rutherford and was originally meant to be offered to a male artist, but Clark helped re-write the song to give it a woman's perspective. It debuted on the US Billboard Hot Country Songs chart the week of March 24, 2007, at number 51. It reached a peak position of number 30 for the week of June 2, 2007, staying there for two non-consecutive weeks. It spent 19 total weeks on the chart. It peaked at number 13 on the Canada Country chart as well as number 68 on the Canadian Hot 100.\nThe title track \"In My Next Life\" premiered on November 27, 2007, as the second single from the album. It debuted on the US Hot Country Songs chart the week of December 1, 2007, at number 60 and rose to a peak position of number 36 on February 16, 2008, where it stayed for one week. It spent 17 weeks in total. It topped the Canada Country chart for one week on February 23, 2008. It peaked at number 66 on the Canadian Hot 100.\n\n\n== Cancellation and departure from BNA ==\nMy Next Life was planned to have a July 24, 2007, release date, but this was pushed back several times. Billboard magazine published an estimated release date of August 7, 2007. A spokesperson later announced that Clark's album would be delayed to early 2008.\nIn November 2008, it was announced that Clark left BNA Records to become independent, abandoning the album project. To members of her fan club, she wrote that there were creative differences between her and BNA, and that she wanted to focus more on the Canadian market.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll songs were produced by Garth Fundis.  The songs \"Tough With Me\" and \"Gypsy Boots\" were later re-recorded and included on Clark's album The Long Way Home (2009), with these versions being produced by Clark alone.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Smiling Hogshead Ranch (SHR) is a community garden located in Long Island City in New York City. It was originally a guerilla garden on the abandoned tracks for the, a spur off the Montauk Cutoff. Originally formed in 2011 by Gil Lopez, It is located on Skillman Avenue.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) has not used the Montauk Cutoff since its freight operations ended and the replacement of its diesel fleet—between 1989 and the late 1990s.: 1   \nIn 2011, Gil Lopez and four friends discovered the Cutoff, deciding to start a community garden on the abadoned tracks due to its size, lack of fence or signage. The group origionally began farming at night to avoid discovery by the MTA but in 2014 entered into a agreement with the MTA to lease the space for gardening when it became clear the farm deterred sex workers and homeless encampments on the tracks.\nIn 2015, the MTA put out a Request For Expressions of Interest (RFEI) for the adaptive reuse of the Montauk Cutoff in a similar vein as the High Line. Garden organizers, community members and activists formed the Cutoff Coalition to put together a proposal that continues using the cutoff for the community. The group's proposal, known as the Dutch Kills Loop, was the leading proposal of the space. It proposed a 1.4 mile circuit of public walkways to link bridges, and park spaces to a restored Dutch Kills inlet and featured environmental restoration, public access, and connection to waterways.\n\n\n== Operations ==\nSmiling Hogshead Ranch operates as an urban farm collective that cultivates various crops, maintains a compost operation that includes windrows, an apiary, feral cat colony, and an amphitheater. Volunteers often work with students from around the five boroughs as they visit the SHR on educational field trips. The cultivation of the land utilizes safe growing practices for reclaiming industrial land high in heavy metals. It recieves help from the New York City Park Department's GreenThumb program.\nUnlike other community gardens in New York City, the garden is not fenced in, allowing it to act as public commons for the community. However, the garden is subject to crop theft, vandalism, truant students, and drug users that volunteers must contend with. The group believes that reclaiming the commons is vital to urban infastructure, allowing the community to organize and actively manage the land.\n\n\n== References ==",

Those were:  \n\nIn May, or in the beginning of June, a division of the Strait Squadron, constituted by the ship of the line Nossa Senhora da Conceição, of 90 guns, by one of the frigates and by the brigantine Lebre, of 24 guns, went to cross to the vicinity of Algiers.\n\n\n== Action ==\nShortly afterwards, they found an Algerian xebec of 26 guns who returned to the base accompanied by a French ship, the Le Désir, which he had seized. Immediately attacked by the Portuguese ships, he was forced to let go of his prey and flee to Algiers pursued by the Lebre. The Algerian xebec took refuge along the coast under the shelter of the fortresses. After a few hours of exchanging fire, with no possibility of approaching the xebec, given the shallow water depth in the area and the arrival of two galleys and four launches from Algiers, the Portuguese ended up withdrawing.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe French ship was sent to Lisbon, under the escort of the Lebre, and then handed over to the consul of France. He entered Lisbon on 19 (or 15) June, and left it again on 24 June, towards the Strait of Gibraltar.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAction of 27 May 1802\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===",

        "content": "On January 22, 2009, Tuareg rebels of the Niger-Mali Tuareg Alliance ambushed Malian forces in Toulousimine, near Boghassa, Mali, but were pushed back by Malian forces.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 2007, a rebellion broke out among Tuareg militants over the lack of implementation of a peace agreement that ended the Tuareg rebellion of 2006. In January 2009, Malian forces were in the middle of Operation Djugitugu, and had attacked and captured a base of the Tuareg rebel group Niger-Mali Tuareg Alliance. The Malian forces were commanded by Ould Meydou, a prominent Malian Arab commander, and former associates of ATNM commander Ibrahim Ag Bahanga.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nOn January 20, 2009, Malian forces announced the capture of an ATNM base at Tinsalak, and that the surrounding area was under the control of Malian forces under the command of El Hadj Ag Gamou, Ould Meydou, Ag Cherif, Faisal, and Baba Ahmed. The capture of Tinsalak was carried out by regular Malian troops. However, two days after the capture of Tinsalak, Malian forces were ambushed by ATNM fighters in Toulousimine. The fighters were pushed back though, and retreated on four vehicles. Malian security sources stated twenty rebels were killed and twenty-five prisoners were taken, including fifteen injured. A source close to notable leaders in Kidal instead stated ten fighters were killed and nine were captured. Three vehicles were recovered by Malian forces and several others were burned.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe failed ambush at Toulousimine was one of the last major attacks carried out by the ATNM during the Tuareg rebellion, and cemented the fracture between Ibrahim Ag Bahanga's faction of the ATNM and the remaining fighters of the May 23, 2006 Democratic Alliance for Change (ADC). Bahanga and a small group of fighters fled to Algeria shortly afterward, and other fighters surrendered to the Malian Army.\n\n\n== References ==",

With its current location being established in 1993, the Park City Library has over 70,000 articles in its collection and provides free computer, internet access as well as an assortment of non-book items available for checkout. The library also has various sections, such as the YouCreate lab, which features various creative tools, a dedicated reading area, and the Park City Room.\n\n\n== History ==\nOriginally established in 1917, on Main Street, the Park City Library was created after locals demanded for it to be constructed, with the institution being staffed by various volunteers. Soon after, the library hosted over 5,000 articles, including various periodicals and magazines. However, a need for a larger library grew, and on September 6, 1982, The Park City Library relocated to the former Miner's Hospital, a building adjacent to City Park. Less than 10 years later, the expansion proved insignificant, with a greater need for a new building. As a result, the Park City Library looked to relocate to the now-abandoned Park City High School Building. The $2.5 million was raised for renovations, and in 1993, the Park City Library and Education Center opened. Another expansion in 2004 added 3300 square feet to the library, and in 2010, plans for another remodel were drafted. The renovation, completed in 2015, saw the Park City Library achieve LEED certification, meeting rooms, and a YouCreate lab which featured 3D printers, video recording devices, and a sound booth. The Park City Library is also Kulture-City Compliant.\n\n\n== Building ==\nThe Park City Library features various attractions inside the building, such as the YouCreate lab, Park City Room, and the Jim Santy Auditorium.\n\n\n=== Lucky Ones Coffee ===\nLucky Ones Coffee is a coffee shop adjacent to the Park City Library. Its scope is to employ persons with various disabilities.\n\n\n=== YouCreate Lab ===\nThe YouCreate Lab is a section of the library dedicated to creativity-related equipment. It features two 3D-Printers, a sound and video recording booth, and green screens.

From there, various fronts of struggle were opened in southern Peru.\nOn December 9, 1841, a regiment under the command of Colonel Manuel Rodríguez Magariños (Chief of the second Bolivian division) occupied Tacna, another under the command of Colonel Bernardo Rojas occupied Arica, and another under the command of Colonel José María García occupied Tarapacá , while José Ballivián's forces occupy Moquegua and Puno.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nAfter having invaded the regions of Tacna, Arica, Tarapacá; The Bolivian army would be besieged by Peruvian guerrillas and militias from each area.\nColonel Manuel Lavayen and Major Juan Bautista Ramos, after having repelled the Bolivian army in Locumba in the battle of Altos de Chipe in December 1841, this time redirected their troops in the Sama valley on January 8, 1842.\nThe guerrillas of Ramos and Lavayén, commanded by 278 men, including Montoneras, infantry soldiers and the local population, defeated the troops of Colonel Manuel Rodríguez Magariños. The entire region of Sama was in their power 6.\nGregorio Albarracín participates in this contest that defeats the Bolivian company in the Sama valley and then, under the orders of Manuel Mendiburu, they confront the forces of José Ballivián until dislodging them from Moquegua 7.\nThe Montoneras of Sama, Lluta and Azapa, which constantly hindered military logistics, preventing them from being resupplied with ammunition and food, had an outstanding performance for the victory; For this reason, the Bolivian troops, seeing themselves weakened and cornered, were defeated in the battles of Arica and Sama, and were forced to retreat towards Puno and Moquegua in February 1842.\nThe Bolivian troops completely abandoned all of Tacna in February 1842.",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Death of a Wish is a 2024 video game developed by Melessthanthree, the pseudonym of independent developer Colin Horgan, and published by Syndicate Atomic. The game expands upon the setting of Horgan's previous title, Lucah: Born of a Dream, and its antagonist Christian, introduced in a DLC release The Descent. Upon release, Death of a Wish received praise by critics for its abstract visual presentation, the pace of combat, and its narrative themes relating to revenge and self-actualisation.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nDeath of a Wish is an action game in which the player character, Christian, vows revenge on the corrupt cult that inhabit the Sanctum led by its figureheads, the Father, the Son, the Cardinal and the Priest. Players battle enemies through a moveset that includes a mixture of light and heavy hack and slash moves that can be chained to break enemy defenses, a dodge roll, sprint, parry and teleport. The player also has a hovering Familiar that performs ranged attacks. Players can further customize their weapons and combat styles, named Arias, throughout the game to acquire new primary and secondary attacks, and collect Prayer Cards that provide additional abilities. In contrast to previous games by Horgan, Death of a Wish does not have a stamina system or cooldown for the use of these abilities, instead featuring enemies with greater use of pursuit, gap-closing and projectile attacks to counter the abilities of the player. The game features a corruption meter, which is a percentage-based statistic that increases each time the player takes damage or dies and decreases when the player performs well in combat encounters. If the meter increases over 100%, the game will trigger a bad ending.\n\n\n== Development ==\nDeath of a Wish was developed by Melessthanthree, the pseudonym of independent developer Colin Horgan. The game originated as a DLC for the developer's preceding title, Lucah: Born of a Dream. Seeking to design a \"richer action experience\" compared to its predecessor, Horgan reworked the combat design and moveset for Death of a Wish, focusing on increased challenge and a more sophisticated enemy and encounter design. These were intended to contribute to an increased pace and aggression to reflect the game's revenge narrative and depiction of Christian, a character \"hurt by an oppressive culture that raised him on self-hatred and self-harm (who) seeks freedom through revenge\". Horgan stated that the tone and aesthetics of the game were inspired by working with independent developer Heather Flowers and the \"angry and righteous\" tone of their previous title, Extreme Meatpunks Forever, and the game Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. Horgan also envisaged Christian as an \"outlet for a lot of feelings\" for \"like-minded people\" in the context of political developments in the United States, particularly in relation to debates around transgender and pro-choice rights. The game was released as a demo on 26 October 2023 and previewed at the February 2024 Steam Next Fest. The game was released for PC and the Switch on 11 March 2024.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nEdwin Evans-Thirlwell of Rock Paper Shotgun praised the game's \"gorgeous\" visual presentation in its \"powerfully abstract\" design and \"spectacle\" of battle, also commending the game's \"crisper work of storytelling\" compared to its predecessor. He cited the \"breathless and stark\" tone core and theme of conflict as \"redemptive self-expression\", earlier for Eurogamer characterising the narrative as continuing the creators \"explorations of religious or filial guilt and the journey towards queer self-acceptance\". Also writing for Rock Paper Shotgun, Alice O'Connor highlighted the game's visual style as \"wildly over the top\" and its explorations of angst as \"perfect\", comparing the game to Bloodborne. Ben Sledge of TheGamer found the game to be memorable, stating that each of the game's elements formed \"one of the most engaging, evocative games I've played in a long time\", discussing the game's \"unique art style, evocative writing, and invigorating combat\". In an impression of the game, Jakob Barnes of PCGamesN highlighted its \"striking\" and \"beautifully unique\" visual style, \"unsettling narrative, formidable foes, and gloomy tone\", comparing the game to Diablo and Vampire Survivors. Shaun Prescott of PC Gamer described the game as \"gorgeously bleak\", praising the \"over-the-top attack animations\" as contributing to the game's \"oppressive atmosphere\". Charlie Kelly of Checkpoint Gaming described the game as a \"must-play\" title, citing its \"unbelievably unique and striking\" visual design, diverse combat system and themes around Catholic guilt and queer identity.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Minerva Goodman (January 2, 1876 – July 1, 1967) was an American physician, suffragist, and clubwoman, based in Stockton, California.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nGoodman was born in Orion Township, Olmsted County, Minnesota, the daughter of Harvey Adelbert Goodman and Jane Ayer Robinson Goodman. She earned her medical degree at the University of Minnesota in 1902.\n\n\n== Career ==\nGoodman was a physician in Stockton, California from 1904 until 1962. As city health officer, she organized \"better baby contests\" and instituted mask mandates during the 1918 flu pandemic. She was also the school medical inspector and secretary of the local American Red Cross chapter. She spoke to community groups on a wide range of public health matters, including meat inspection and safety in childbirth. She helped to create Stockton's sanatorium for tuberculosis patients. \"Dr. Goodman is not a woman of beautiful theories and cobwebbed plans, but of practical ideas cast in the mould of common sense,\" explained a 1909 newspaper profile.\nFrom 1924 to 1962, Goodman was the physician for women students at the College of the Pacific. She was president of the Stockton Political Equality Club. She supported the work of the Wage Earners' Equal Suffrage League of San Francisco, and the Political Equality League of Los Angeles. After the vote was won, she was active in the local League of Women Voters.\nBeyond her medicine and suffrage activities, Stockton was president of Stockton's Business and Professional Women's Club, and president of the San Jose chapter of the American Association of University Women (AAUW). She hiked with the Sierra Club, and was a leader of the Stockton Camp Fire Girls. She traveled in Europe during the summer of 1927, and wrote travel descriptions for the Stockton newspaper. She served on the board of directors of Goodwill Industries of Stockton in the late 1930s. In 1954, she attended a Stockton city council meeting to protest a change in policy pertaining to sidewalk repairs.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nGoodman adopted and raised a daughter, Elizabeth, who was born in 1915. Goodman died in 1967, at the age of 91. There is a collection of her papers, mostly concerning her suffrage work, in the collection of the University of the Pacific.\n\n\n== References ==",

He was a close student of Rav Huna and the uncle of Rav Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak.\nHe was a student of Rav Chisda, a second- or third-generation Amora.\nThere is a dispute about whether the Amora named Rav Acha barei deRav Yosef is the same person or not. According to Seder HaDoroth they were the same person. However, Aaron Hyman, in \"Toledot Tannaim veAmoraim\" claims this is a mistake. \nHyman writes that Rav Acha barei deRav Yosef was a student of Rav Ashi, a sixth-generation Amora, and would frequently as him questions. Rav Ashi praised him for his brilliance. \nAaron Magid agrees with Seder HaDoroth. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Aelita was a Soviet design of a version of a Soyuz spacecraft started in 1978. The Aelita was part of the Soyuz programme, but was planned to use an unmanned Soyuz spacecraft as an infrared astronomy telescope satellite. A Soyuz spacecraft was planned to be modified to become the Aelita project satellite. The Aelita project not completed, and was cancelled in 1982.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe Soviet plan for an infrared astronomy satellite began in 1965 as part of the Soviet Cloud Space Station plan. The Cloud Space Station developed into MKBS/MOK space station complex plan. In February 1976, both production of Aelita and production of the MKBS/MOK-Mir space station where approved. Aelita was to have a gross mass of 7,350 kilograms (16,200 lb). Aelita plans had a passive space docking port so that the spacecraft could be serviced by Soyuz manned spacecraft. Crew members could replace the telescope film cassettes every six months and repair or replace instruments if needed. Since the spacecraft/satellite would not need to go through reentry into the atmosphere of Earth the Soyuz descent equipment and orbital modules would be remove, so the infrared astronomy telescope could be installed. The telescope was to be placed in a large pressurized cylinder in the Soyuz spacecraft. By 1978, the Aelita instrument payload was in the design and developed phase. Soyuz spacecrafts were built by Experimental Design Bureau. In May 1974, the N1 launch vehicle and the MKBS space station both were cancelled after the many failures of the N1 rocket. Aelita was sub set of the MKBS space station, not Mir, so Aelita was also cancelled. After the failure of the N1 rocket and thus the Soviet lunar program, the Soviet space program was completely reorganized. While the lunar project was cancelled in February 1976, a new space station was authorization the DOS-7/DOS-8 space station, that evolved into Mir launched in 1986. While Aelita ever flew, Aelita's sister spacecraft, the Gamma satellite, was complete and was launched in 1990. The Gamma project was a joint Soviet-French project.\nAelita is known for being one of the longest projects on the drawing board, started in 1965 and ending in 1982, 17 years in planning.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nSoyuz 7K\nSoyuz 9K\nSoyuz 7K-P\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nRSC Energia: Concept Of Russian Manned Space Navigation Development\nDavid S.F.

        "content": "Kathleen Marshall Clay Price Bryan (April 23, 1900 – August 6, 1984) was an American heiress and philanthropist. She founded the Junior League of Greensboro, North Carolina in 1926. Along with her husband, Joseph M. Bryan, she was an active philanthropist in North Carolina. Bryan was a patron of United Way, Our Lady of Grace Catholic Church, the Diplomatic Reception Rooms of the Department of State, and Duke University. Following her death, the Katherine Price Bryan Family Fund was established to provide grants to various North Carolina organizations.\n\n\n== Early life and family ==\nBryan was born Kathleen Marshall Clay Price on April 23, 1900, in Greensboro, North Carolina to Julian Price, an insurance executive who developed the Jefferson Standard Life Insurance Company, and Ethel Clay Price, a socialite and retired nurse. Her father was Baptist and her mother was Catholic. Bryan was the granddaughter of Colonel Henry de Boisfeuillet Clay, a U.S. Infantry officer and Civil War veteran.\n\n\n== Philanthropy ==\nOn May 26, 1926, Bryan, along with nine of her friends from book club, selected a group of twenty-four additional young women to form the Greensboro Charity League. Their first meeting was at the Blue Room in the O. Henry Hotel. The Charity League later joined the Association of Junior Leagues and hosted a national representative of the League in 1927. It was officially incorporated by the national organization as the Junior League of Greensboro on March 5, 1928.\nIn the 1950s, she and her brother donated $300,000 to help fund the construction of Our Lady of Grace Catholic Church, originally started by her father as a memorial to her mother. The parish later named the Kathleen Price Bryan Banquet Hall in her honor.\nIn 1968, Bryan and her husband began making an annual contribution of $25,000 to United Way.\nOn May 12, 1970, Bryan and her husband were honored with a plaque, signed by U.S. Secretary of State William P. Rogers, for their financial contributions to the Diplomatic Reception Rooms of the U.S. Department of State.\nBryan and her husband were patrons of Duke University and were granted a certificate of appreciation from the university in 1980.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn New York, she met Joseph M. Bryan, an insurance businessman and the youngest member of the New York Cotton Exchange. They married on November 19, 1927, in Greensboro and lived together in New York City. They had three children: Katherine, Nancy, and Joseph Jr.\nIn 1931, the Bryans moved to Greensboro, where her husband took a job with her father's insurance company, Jefferson Standard Life Insurance, eventually serving as director of the Jefferson-Pilot Corporation. They lived at Albright House, a 19th-century mansion. They later moved into a mansion in the Irving Park Historic District.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nBryan had Alzheimer's disease and died in 1984. After her death, her husband donated over $10 million to Duke University School of Medicine for Alzheimer's disease research.\nIn honor of Bryan, her family founded the Kathleen Price Bryan Family Fund, a charitable foundation that provided millions of dollars in donations and grants to causes in Greensboro and throughout North Carolina. The foundation provided funding for Oak Ridge Military Academy, the United Arts Council of Greensboro, the Center for Community Self-Help, Urban Ministries, Hospice at Greensboro, and The Salvation Army. The foundation was dissolved in 2000, distributing $70 million in assets among The Anonymous Fund, The Stewards Fund, and the Julian Price Family Fund, all run by Bryan's children.\nIn 2008, Bryan's home became the headquarters for the Junior League of Greensboro.\nThe Greensboro City Council named Bryan Park after her and her husband.\nThe Joseph M. and Kathleen Price Bryan University Center at Duke University is named after Bryan and her husband. A scholarship fund named after them, the Kathleen Price and Joseph M. Bryan Family Foundation Scholarship, was created for students at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. Other buildings named for the couple were built at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, and North Carolina A&T University.\nThe Kathleen P. and Joseph M. Bryan Fellowship is offered through the Kathleen Price and Joseph M. Bryan Endowment Fund for business students at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.\nThe Kathleen Price and Joseph M. Bryan Youth Concerto Competition was formed as an instrumentalist performance competition for musical students in North Carolina.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Global Antisemitism Review Act, officially the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act of 2004 is a U.S. law passed in 2004 that established the Office of the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism.\n\n\n== History ==\nCongressman Tom Lantos (D-CA), the only Holocaust survivor in the U.S. House and the ranking member of the House International Relations Committee drafted the bill, introduced as HR 4230, in response to an international surge in antisemitism, especially in Europe. Lantos' bill called for the State Department to report annually on the status of Jews globally and would create an Office to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism within the State Department. It gained 33 co-sponsors, including Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Democrat John Lewis.\nThe act was opposed by the State Department under Secretary Colin Powell, which said it already included antisemitism in annual reports on Annual Report on International Religious Freedom and Country Reports on Human Rights Practices. A three-page State Department memo released in July suggested that reporting out one form of hatred for special attention would purportedly set a bad precedent and could be interpreted as favoritism. In response, Lantos said such opposition was reminiscent of the department's attitude toward Jews in the 1930s, when the U.S. was opposed to allow refugees from the Nazis into the country. He said the new ratings was not \"favoring a group, but an issue of responding to a problem.\" Lantos sent a letter  to Powell stating that \"It is mind-boggling that the department would make such a dismissive and ignorant assessment of global antisemitism\" and highlighted that State Department reports already contained special sections covering women, children, disabled people, laborers. and human rights NGOs.\nCongressman Chris Smith (R-NJ) and Senator George Voinovich (R-OH) introduced a less strenuous version of Lantos' bill, which called for a one-time State Department report on antisemitism and required the inclusion of antisemitism in the State Department's Annual Report on International Religious Freedom and Country Reports on Human Rights Practices. The Smith and Voinovich's version did not create a new office.\nVoinoich's version unanimously passed the U.S. Senate on May 7. The bill required the State Department to deliver a one-time report on international antisemitism to Congress by November 15. It also directs the State Department to include the special report's findings in its annual International Religious Freedom and Human Rights reports. However, it did not create a new office.\nIn September, Smith and Voinoich stepped up their efforts to advocate for the bill's passage amidst a push by Congressional Republicans to focus attention on antisemitism. The campaign kicked off on September 14 with a speech by Senator Rick Santorum. On September 23, the U.S. Senate passed legislation urging members of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to consider appointing a special envoy to ensure \"sustained attention with respect to fulfilling OSCE commitments on the reporting of antisemitic crimes.\" On October 1, Lantos told The Forward that chances of the bill's passage were \"very, very strong.\"\nIn the face of State Department opposition, Lantos and Smith entered into negotiations. On September 22, Smith agreed to accept Lantos's proposal. One component of support was an open letter signed organized by the David S. Wyman Institute for Holocaust Studies calling for Powell to support Lantos' bill. The letter was signed by 104 prominent Americans, including former Republican vice presidential nominee Jack Kemp, former United Nations ambassador Jeanne Kirkpatrick, ex-CIA directorJames Woolsey and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Garry Wills. A group of religious leaders, former administration officials, academics, writers, and artists, sent a letter to Powell in September protesting the department's opposition to the Lantos bill.\nPresident George W. Bush signed the bill into law while in Florida on October 16, 2004. In a speech, Bush stated that \"Defending freedom also means disrupting the evil of anti-Semitism.\"\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nThe American Jewish Committee supported the passage of a bill combatting antisemitism in principle, but did not endorse one version of the bill.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Paul Spotts Emrick (March 30, 1884 – July 28, 1965) was the first full-time director of the Purdue All-American Marching Band. He became director while still a student at Purdue University in 1905, and then served as full-time director from 1908 to 1954.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nA native of Rochester, Indiana, Emrick was born into a musical family; his father directed the citizens' band, and several other members of his family had been band directors. While a student at Rochester High School, the younger Emrick directed a number of ensembles that played at dances and dramatic performances. He primarily played the clarinet, but also played the violin and cornet, among other instruments.\n\n\n== Director of the All-American Marching Band ==\nEmrick came to Purdue in 1904 as an electrical engineering major and immediately joined the school's band. By the time he arrived in West Lafayette, the band had existed for 18 years but had only recently come into its own. The band members had to furnish their own uniforms, instruments, and music. When Emrick arrived, he was one of the few members with a musical background. The directors were elected by the bandsmen either from among themselves or from the faculty. Despite these handicaps, the band had grown to 50 members by 1902, and had become a fixture at football games even though it primarily served to play at drills and ceremonies for the Student Army Training Corps (forerunner of the Purdue ROTC).Due to his experience as a director, Emrick was elected as the band's president and director in 1905, as only a sophomore. Two years later, as a senior, Emrick instituted one of the first of a long list of innovations. At a 1907 game, the band formed a large block \"P\" as part of its pregame show. It was the first time a marching band had broken out of military ranks to form letters on the field. The \"Block P\" has been part of every AAMB pregame show since. Years later, in a 1953 interview with the Lafayette Journal & Courier, Emrick recounted seeing geese fly over a lake in the fall, saying \"usually, they'd fly in a 'V', but once in a while, they'd change formation and fly in various figures. I used to wonder if you could do that with men drilling.\"\nEmrick was hired as the band's first full-time director after graduating in 1908 and was also appointed a professor of electrical engineering. Under his watch, in 1919 the band became the first to carry the flags of the other schools in the Big Ten Conference. In the same year, it played at the Indianapolis 500, an engagement it has kept for all but three years since then. In 1920, it was the first band to play the opposing school's fight song. In 1935, it was the first band to play with lights on its instruments and uniforms.His most visible legacy, however, came in 1921. He asked the Leedy Manufacturing Company of Indianapolis to create a giant bass drum \"larger than the man playing it\". The result was the famous Purdue Big Bass Drum, which debuted that fall. While the size of the resulting drum remains a closely guarded secret, published reports showed it was originally 7 feet 3 inches (2.21 m) in diameter and 3 feet 9 inches (1.14 m) wide.Emrick was also a noted composer of marches. In 1925, John Philip Sousa read one of them and was impressed enough that when Sousa's band came to Purdue for a performance, Sousa handed his baton to Emrick.Emrick retired as a professor in 1946 but continued as band director until 1954. More than 6,000 students marched under his baton over the years. By the time he retired for good, he had spent the first half-century of his adult life in West Lafayette as a student, professor, and band director.\n\n\n== Retirement and death ==\nEmrick retired to his hometown of Rochester in 1956. He suffered a severe cerebral hemorrhage in July 1965 and died at Woodlawn Hospital in Rochester on July 11. He had married his second wife, Adeline, in 1946. He had married his first wife, Martha, in 1907 while still a student at Purdue; she had died in 1942.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===",

        "content": "In French public law, the public domain is all property (immovable or movable) belonging to the State, local authorities, public establishments or other public bodies, and assigned to a public purpose.\nThis public utility may result from the property being assigned for the direct use of the public (such as roads or public gardens) or for a public service, provided that, in the latter case, the property is subject to development that is essential to the performance of the tasks of that public service (such as a university or a court). Prior to 2006, case law applied the criterion of special development, and as such, property that had been classified as public domain property prior to this date did not lose this status, as the Conseil d'Etat ruled that the criterion of essential development was not retroactive.\nThe Direction de l'immobilier de l'État (DIE), created in 2016 to replace France Domaine (formerly Les Domaines), is a department of the Ministry of Finance responsible for administering the State's public domain assets, both movable and immovable, and monitoring the acquisition and disposal policies of local authorities and their public establishments.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe concept of the public domain stems both from doctrinal proposals (such as the work of Proudhon) and from case law protecting its use during the nineteenth century.\nThe public domain is often confused with the notion of the unavailability of the Domaine royal or Domaine de la Couronne under the Ancien Régime. Although, since the Edict of Moulins, property belonging to the Crown Estate was inalienable, this inalienability applied to all property, regardless of its use. It therefore has nothing in common with the public domain as we know it today, which protects property allocated to the public interest.\n\n\n== Definition of public domain ==\n\n\n=== Public real estate ===\nAccording to article L. 2111-1 of the General Code of Public Property, the public domain of a public entity (the State, local authorities and their groupings, public establishments, or other public entities mentioned in article L. 2 of the General Code of Public Property) is made up, unless special legislative provisions apply, of immovable property that belongs to this public entity and:\n\nare assigned for the direct use of the public,\nare assigned to a public service. In the latter case, they must have been the subject of \"development essential to the performance of the tasks of this public service\".\nPrior to the entry into force of the General Code on the Ownership of Public Property in 2006, the case law of the Conseil d'État, dated 19 October 1956, Le Béton, had specified that an asset was part of the public domain if it belonged to a public entity and had undergone \"special\" development with regard to the public service for which it was assigned.\nFor example, in the Dauphin ruling of 1959, the Conseil d'Etat ruled that a driveway had been incorporated into the public domain because:\n\nIt belonged to the State, and that;\non the one hand, the State had assigned it to a public service because of the presence of an archaeological site at that location; and\non the other hand, the authorities had installed two posts and a chain to close off access to this pathway, which constituted a \"special arrangement\" carried out specifically with a view to assigning the pathway to this cultural public service.\nThe General Code on the Ownership of Public Property (CGPPP) has taken up this concept, but specifies that the development must be \"essential\" to the public service mission: the aim is to curb the trend in case law, which tended to extend the public domain too far. This new classification did not have the effect of downgrading property that had been allocated before the Code came into force.\nThe status of property belonging to the public domain may also result from a legal qualification. This is the case with radio waves, which the Act of 26 July 1996 placed in a \"public domain of radio frequencies\" by entrusting ARCEP with the task of allocating frequency bands.\n\n\n=== Movable public domain ===\nArticle L. 2112-1 of the General Code on the Ownership of Public Property stipulates that movable property may belong to the public domain. In this case, the movable property must belong to a public entity and be of \"public interest from the point of view of history, art, archaeology, science or technology\". The same article sets out a non-exhaustive list of items meeting this requirement, such as:\n\nMuseum collections;\nlibrary collections of old, rare or precious documents;\npublic collections belonging to the Mobilier national and the Manufacture nationale de Sèvres.\n\n\n=== Private domain ===\nAlongside their public domain, public bodies also have a private domain, which is subject to approximately the same legal rules as property belonging to a private individual.\nArticle L. 2211-1 of the CGPPP stipulates that property that does not meet the criteria for public property belongs in the private domain.\nThe law may also classify as private property assigned to a public service or used by the public. This is the case in particular for \"land reserves and real estate used for offices, excluding those forming an indivisible whole with real estate belonging to the public domain\", as well as rural roads and \"woods and forests belonging to public bodies covered by the forestry regime\".\n\n\n== Delimitation of the public domain ==\nA distinction can be made between elements of the public domain according to whether they are natural or artificial, and according to their geographical location.\n\n\n=== The natural public domain ===\n\n\n==== Public maritime domain ====\nThe public maritime domain was defined by Colbert's marine ordinance of 1681, until the ordinance of 21 April 2006 relating to the legislative part of the General Code of Public Property, which repealed this old provision in article 7. Colbert's decree specified that \"the edge and shore of the sea shall be deemed to be all that it covers and uncovers during the new and full moons, and as far as the great flood of March can extend over the shores\" (foreshore).\nUntil 1973, to set the limit of the public maritime domain on the Mediterranean coast, case law even referred to Roman law and to an ordinance issued by Justinian, which set the winter high water as the reference point, rather than the March high water. The Conseil d'Etat unified the rule by specifying that the public maritime domain extends \"to the point where the highest seas can extend, in the absence of exceptional disturbances\". It therefore makes no difference whether high water occurs in winter or March. This case law will be taken up by the new Code.\nThe clarification regarding the absence of exceptional disturbances makes it possible to avoid a sudden increase in the public domain during a storm or temporary flooding.\nThe law of 28 November 1963 extended this maritime public domain to the soil and subsoil of the territorial sea and to alluvial deposits (\"lais et relais de la mer \").\nFinally, in the French overseas departments, the public maritime domain also includes the area known as the \"cinquante pas géométriques\" along the limit of the highest tides. This was originally intended to reserve for the King of France a strip of land fifty paces (81.20 metres) long along the shore of the lands discovered in America, for military purposes.\n\n\n==== River public domain ====\nArticles L 2111-7 and L 2111-8 of the General Public Property Code (CGPPP) list navigable and/or floatable watercourses, frozen watercourses or lakes, banks covered by water and the waters of overseas departments.\nThe 1964 decree establishes the nomenclature of navigable and non-navigable watercourses.\nThe boundaries of watercourses are determined on the basis of the notion of bank (defined in article 558 of the Civil Code), extending to the notion of ditches (meadows in counterpart to regularly flooded banks) and boires (natural water reserves for animals).\nFor a lake with a spillway: the boundary is the banks above the spillway. When the lake does not have a spillway, the limit is established by the highest level reached outside of exceptional floods (Lake Geneva).\n\n\n==== Public airspace ====\nThere is no such thing as an aerial public domain. The Conseil d'Etat (decision of 8 March 1993, Commune des Molières) has not established the idea of an aerial public domain.\n\n\n==== Subsoil ====\nArticle 552 of the French Civil Code states that \"ownership of the land entails ownership of the land below and above it \". This means that the owner may carry out any works he wishes under the ground, provided that they do not adversely affect the archaeological heritage, and provided that they do not involve the exploitation of materials covered by the Mining Code, for which the State alone may grant the right of exploitation.\nHowever, the owner of the land may sell or be expropriated part of the subsoil of his property, for example to build a railway or road tunnel. This underground volume may be classified as an artificial public domain, if the conditions are met.\n\n\n==== Public radio broadcasting ====\nThe law of 17 January 1989 established that radio waves (radio frequencies) constitute a means of private occupation of the public domain (invitation to tender for UMTS licences, for example).\nToday, the existence of the public radio domain is affirmed by the legislator in the Code générale de la propriété des personnes publiques, 2111-17: \"The radio frequencies available on the territory of the Republic come under the public domain of the State\". Article L.2124-26 states that \"the use, by licence holders, of radio frequencies available on the territory of the Republic constitutes a private occupation of the State's public domain\".\n\n\n=== Artificial public domain ===\nThe artificial public domain includes the assets of the artificial public domain assigned for direct use by the public, and certain assets assigned to public services.\nThe items assigned for direct use by the public include:\n\nthe public road domain, consisting of \"all public domain assets  of the State, départements and communes assigned to the needs of land traffic, with the exception of railways\", which is governed by the Highway Code;\ncertain assets belonging to local authorities, such as public washhouses, landscaped public promenades and religious buildings that existed before the 1905 Separation Act and whose ownership was assigned to the communes and the State by the Act of 17 April 1906 and the Decree of 4 July 1912.\nProperty belonging to a public entity and assigned to a public service also forms part of the artificial public domain, if it has been subject to:\n\na special development necessary for the operation of the public service, for property incorporated into the public domain before the entry into force of the General Code of the Property of Public Persons,\nan improvement that is essential to the operation of the public service, in the case of property allocated since 1 April 2006,\nfor example:\n\nmuseums, schools, prisons, sewage systems, market halls and markets, abattoirs, cemeteries, etc.;\nassets that constitute the very object of the service (furniture contained in public buildings, etc.);\ndefence works (fortifications, naval and air bases, etc.);\nSNCF Réseau structures and facilities;\naerodromes used for public air traffic;\nthe artificial public river domain, consisting of seaports and structures established in the interests of maritime navigation;\nski slopes.\n\n\n== Protection of the public domain ==\nThe legal status of the public domain is characterised in particular by its protection, i.e. by :\n\ninalienability, i.e. the impossibility for a public entity to transfer to a private entity property belonging to its public domain before declassifying it, which means transferring it to its private domain,\nunseizability and, in general, the impossibility of using private law enforcement procedures against public bodies);\nand, as a result of its inalienability, its imprescriptibility(i.e. the impossibility for third parties to acquire a right to this property by prescription, i.e. by prolonged possession as in ordinary law: the public authority or body that owns the property can claim it at any time, even if a person has been occupying the public domain for a very long time (in French private law, prescription takes effect after 30 years).\nThis is why, before being transferred to a private party, public domain property must first be declassified, which presupposes that the public utility purpose has been removed and that a formal decision has been taken by the authorities. In some cases, this may require the intervention of a law (see, for example, the law on the inalienability of the royal estate or the Maori heads affair, laws relating to the privatisation of EDF or France-Télécom-Orange), the intervention of a public enquiry (e.g. in relation to public roads) or the agreement of another authority or of the person to whom the property is assigned (e.g. the agreement of the person to whom a church or other religious building is assigned).\nThe private use of any element of the public domain by a person who is not the manager must be authorised in writing by the manager, and this occupation, which is normally granted for a consideration and on a precarious and revocable basis, must be compatible with the public domain use.\nThe public domain is also protected by rigorous penalties for damage to the public domain: the \"contravention de voirie\" for property in the public road domain, and the \"contravention de grande voirie \" for other property.\n\n\n=== Consequences ===\nBecause it is used for a public purpose, the public domain cannot be expropriated, can only with difficulty be subject to easements, and can now be the subject of a business (Pinel law of 18 June 2014) but under certain very restrictive conditions; private occupation agreements or authorisations (for an individual or a private legal entity) are always precarious.\nWe are seeing major attempts to reconcile the traditional desire to protect the public domain by virtue of its use, on the one hand, and the desire to enhance its economic value, on the other. This has even led some to question the usefulness of retaining the principle of the inalienability of the public domain [ref. needed]. These questions are the result of different approaches to the concept of the public domain: once an area to be protected against royal squandering, today it is seen as a resource to be exploited.\nHowever, the taxation of immovable property in the public domain is not exorbitant on this point, insofar as, by virtue of the principle of tax neutrality, it is taxed according to the same rules as those applicable to private individuals.\n\n\n== Leaving the public domain ==\n\n\n=== Conditions for leaving the public domain ===\nAn asset owned by a public entity referred to in article L. 1, which is no longer used for a public service or for the direct use of the public, is no longer part of the public domain from the date of the administrative act declaring its decommissioning\n\n\n==== Decommissioning (Disuse) ====\nAs public property is property belonging to a public entity and used directly by the public, or used for a public service and equipped with essential facilities (since CGPPP 2006), before a decision can be taken to declassify public property, it must be removed from this use. The authority that manages the public domain asset must establish that it has in fact been decommissioned.\n\n\n==== Downgrading (Reclassification) ====\nIn contrast to \"désaffectation,\" or disuse which refers to a factual situation, \"déclassement\" or reclassificaiton, implies an explicit decision by the authority responsible for public property. (minister, prefect, decision-making body of a public institution or local authority, etc.) by decree, order or decision, following a formal procedure which, in some cases, includes a public enquiry or the need to obtain the agreement of a third party authority.\nProperty decommissioned from the public domain becomes part of the private domain of the public entity that owns it, which may then give it a new purpose, keep it as a land reserve, manage it as private property or finally decide to sell it under the conditions of civil law, subject, where applicable, to compliance with certain rules designed to protect the interests of the State and its public policies.\n\n\n=== Legal situation if not decommissioned ===\nWhen an asset in the public domain is decommissioned without having been disused, or when it is once again used directly by the public or for a public service for which it has been specially equipped, the asset remains or is classified in the public domain.\n\n\n==== Inalienability of property not decommissioned ====\nThe property of the public bodies referred to in Article L. 1, which comes under the public domain, is inalienable and imprescriptible\nThey are also exempt from seizure, meaning that a creditor cannot seize property to obtain payment of his debt. However, creditors do have other means of obtaining payment of their debt, such as having the prefect automatically authorise payment of the amount of a debt owed by a local authority. Consequently, public property cannot be used as collateral.\nThese provisions are intended to ensure the regular operation of the public service to which the asset is assigned, or the maintenance of its direct use by the public.\n\n\n==== Deferred decommissioning ====\n(...) a building belonging to the artificial public domain of the State or its public establishments and used for a public service may be decommissioned as soon as it has been decommissioned, even if the requirements of the public service justify the decommissioning taking effect only within a period set by the decommissioning act. This period may not exceed a period set by decree. This period may not exceed three years. In the event of the sale of this property, the deed of sale shall stipulate that it will be cancelled ipso jure if it is not decommissioned within this period.\nThese provisions do not apply to the property of local authorities and their public establishments. However, a reform will be submitted to Parliament in 2016 to give them the option of deferred decommissioning.\n\n\n== Notes and References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nMinistère de L'économie des Finances et de La Souveraineté Industrielle et Numérique (n.d.). \"Nouvelle politique immobilière de l'Etat\".\nConseil d'Etat (1956), Conseil d'Etat, Section, du 19 octobre 1956, 20180, publié au recueil Lebon, retrieved 2024-04-10\nConseil d’Etat (1959). \"Conseil d'Etat, Assemblée, 11 mai 1959, Dauphin, rec. p. 294\".

The final was played on 11 April 2024 at the Mohammed bin Zayed Stadium, Abu Dhabi, between Al-Ittihad and Al-Hilal.\nAl-Hilal defeated Al-Ittihad 4–1 to win their record-extending fourth title.\n\n\n== Teams ==\n\n\n== Venue ==\n\nThe Mohammed bin Zayed Stadium was announced as the venue of the final on 9 March 2023. This was the first time the tournament was hosted in the United Arab Emirates.\nThe Mohammed bin Zayed Stadium was built and opened in 1980 and underwent renovations in 2006. The stadium was used as a venue for the 2007 Arabian Gulf Cup, the 2009 and the 2010 editions of the FIFA Club World Cup, and the 2019 AFC Asian Cup. It is used by Al-Jazira and the United Arab Emirates national team as a home stadium.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nAs part of the running sponsorship deal between the Saudi Arabian Football Federation (SAFF) and the Diriyah company, the match was officially referred to as \"The Diriyah Saudi Super Cup\".\nThis was Al-Ittihad's fourth appearance in the final. Al-Ittihad were the defending champions having beaten Al-Fayha in last year's final. Al-Ittihad lost the 2013 and 2018 finals to Al-Fateh and Al-Hilal respectively. Al-Ittihad qualified by defeating Al-Wehda 2–1 in the semi-finals.\nAl-Hilal was making their sixth finals appearance, the most by any club. They won the title three times, in 2015, 2018, and 2021. Al-Hilal qualified after defeating derby rivals Al-Nassr 2–1 in the semi-finals.\nThis was the second meeting between these two sides in the Saudi Super Cup and the eleventh meeting in a cup final. Al-Hilal previously defeated Al-Ittihad 2–1 in the 2018 edition. In the ten previous cup final meetings, both teams won five times each with the first cup final dating back to the 1964 King Cup final. This was the 162nd competitive meeting between the two sides in all competitions. In their prior encounters, Al-Hilal won 73 times, Al-Ittihad won 42 times, and the two teams drew 46 times. The two teams had met five times previously in the 2023–24 season, with Al-Hilal winning all five meetings.\n\n\n== Match ==\n\n\n=== Details ===",

        "content": "The Canadian Open Old-Time Fiddling Championship is one of the most important fiddle festivals in Canada. Founded in 1951, the contest was held annually in early August in Shelburne, Ontario. In the 2010s, it also became part of the Heritage Music Festival. It was the second longest-running fiddle competition in the country (behind the Maritime Fiddle Festival in Nova Scotia), although the contest has not been held since 2019. Several of the top fiddlers in Ontario have won the contest, including Pierre Schryer, Louis Schryer, Graham Townsend, Eleanor Townsend, Frank Leahy, Julie Fitzgerald, Shane Cook, and Scott Woods (fiddler).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe Canadian Open Old-Time Fiddling Championship began as a fundraiser for the Rotary Club, with sponsorship from the club  and the CBC. It came at a time when fiddle music was popular on the radio and the number of fiddlers in Ontario began to increase.\nThe idea for the contest came from Shelburne Royal Bank manager Cliff McIntosh after he saw a fiddle contest in another province. It was proposed as a fundraiser for the Rotary Club to help fund their charity donations, with the club set to organize the event. There were doubts from Rotary members that a contest would work, considering the Rotary Club hoped that people would pay to hear fiddlers play and compete despite the music being free on the radio. There was also concern about finding enough fiddlers to compete, which led to volunteers driving around the region to promote the event and find fiddlers. As there were few contests of its kind before the 1950s, it was somewhat of a new idea for locals to consider fiddling as a competition. The committee also advertised through various newspapers and radio stations across the region, and had fiddlers spread the word of the contest.Don Fairbairn, who hosted “Neighbourly News” on CBC, also got involved in the event, and was able to get the CBC to broadcast the contest. The involvement of the CBC helped grow the audience of the contest and its popularity. In 1973, the CBC also produced a documentary called “The Fiddles of Shelburne” about the event and its origins.The first contest happened on 11 August 1951, aligning with an open slot in the CBC's broadcasting schedule. Held in the Shelbourne Arena, it had the initial round on Friday, with the finals on Saturday. Admission costs ranged from 35 cents to 1 dollar, depending on age and event, with contestants paid $2 to enter, a fee that was discontinued in 1983, with proceeds going to charity. They made about $1000 from the event (which is nearly $12,000 in 2024). They had 44 contestants in total, including local fiddlers Lome Donaldson, Charlie Dyer, Annie Webster, and Albert Mews. The first winner was Mel Lavigne, with the first song played “The Victory Breakdown.” \nThe event became a massive success and brought thousands of visitors to the small town, with roughly 10,000 people in attendance between the players, organizers, volunteers, and audience. Discussing its impact, the Shelburne Free Press wrote “in a small community like Shelburne, everyone is affected to some degree by the Fiddle Contest, because so many of the town’s residents dedicate their time and efforts towards the event’s success…by 1951, the fiddle and fiddle music were traditions of Dufferin community life.” \n\n\n=== Growth ===\nFollowing its success in the early years, the event grew past just the two-days of the contest. Over the years, the festival added a country jamboree, jam sessions, square dancing, concerts, step dancing, a parade, a Fiddle Queen pageant, street fairs, dinners, a BBQ and market, and a church service.  The events span over a week, expanding the tourist traffic to the town. The popularity of the event also led to Shelburne to be dubbed “Fiddleville.”  It also proved to be a major fundraiser for the Rotary Club. While it grossed about $1000 in 1951, the amount grew by 1972 to $20,000 (roughly $148,000 in 2024), with about three-times that amount being put into the community through accommodations, shopping, and food spending by visitors.\nThe earlier competitions held a jamboree while the judges decided on the winners. The contestants were recorded as they played, allowing the judges to listen again to their performances and decided together the top players. The judges now use headphones to listen to fiddlers, while remaining in an ‘open judging’ situation where they can watch the players on stage while listening through the audio equipment. Their “audience-attraction” played a part in their scores, acting as a performance/presentation criteria.By the 1980s, the contest grew to hosting over 150 fiddlers and eight separate classes. \nThe name of the event changed over the years, from the “Canadian Open Championship Old Time Fiddlers’ Contest,” to “The National Fiddle Contest,” and more recent returning to a version of the original as the “Canadian Open Old Time Fiddle Championship.” By 2004, the Canadian Open Old Time Fiddle Championship saw contestants from across Canada and the United States compete, becoming known as “the contest to enter.”  However, the Pembroke Fiddle & Step Dancing contest, along with the Canadian Grand Masters, have eclipsed the contest in terms of attracting a wider range of fiddlers across the country, especially due to their closeness in dates and being near Labour Day weekend. However, as argued by Sherry Johnson, the Canadian Open Old Time Fiddle Championship helped shaped these contests and their formats and became a vessel for “national exposure” for the contestants.\n\n\n=== Decline of Old-Time Fiddlers and Reinvention ===\nBy the 2010s, the contest was primarily organized by the Rotary Club of Shelburne, with various local sponsors. In 2018, they merged with the Heritage Music Festival in a move to rejuvenate the festival. This came as growing concern over the perceived dwindling number of fiddlers in the region, despite a growth of young fiddlers in Toronto. At the same time, the championship saw few contestants than previous years. With the help of siblings Linsey and Tyler Beckett, and former champions Scott Woods and Louis Schryer, they helped to promote the contest and entice new fiddlers to sign up for the event. \nAnother major issue impacting the survival of the festival came in 2020, with the cancellation of the contest due to the pandemic. Despite plans to reschedule for the next year, 2021, although it was cancelled again. As of 2024, the contest has not been held since 2019.\n\n\n== Format ==\nContestants are asked to play a waltz, jig, and reel/breakdown/hornpipe in that order. This was set as the main rule by organizers in accordance with contests in Western Canada. From 1951 to 1976, only one person, New Brunswick's Ned Landry, was disqualified for playing their tunes in the wrong order in 1959. All three songs must be performed in under four minutes unless otherwise specified for a specific class (championship/open class includes a Canadian tune of choice, for instance). The tunes played must belong to the Old Time fiddle style.\nThe contest consists of  Championship/Open, Duet, Gospel, Novelty, Canadian Old Time Junior Championship (18 Years & Under), 19–55, 10–12, 9 Years & Under, 56 Years & Over classes (ten classes in total), along with prizes for Canadian tune of choice, youngest competitor, oldest contestant, best fiddler from Dufferin County, and most entertaining fiddler. Contestants are allowed to enter one individual class, the Novelty and Gospel classes, and one of either the duet or group classes.\nJudges award points based on time and tempo, tone, style and technique, and overall accuracy. Depending on the class, contestants play in the preliminaries before the top players are selected to play again in the finals where the winners will be chosen by the judges.\n\n\n== Winners ==\n\n\n=== Champion/Open Class ===\nWinners of this class are considered the Canadian Open Champions. Louis Schryer holds the record for the most championship wins.

        "content": "TTL Hua Tiao Chicken Noodles (Chinese: 台酒花雕雞麵; pinyin: Táijiǔ Huādiāo Jī Miàn) are a brand of instant noodle that is marketed in Taiwan by the Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corporation in 2013. It is a series of wine-spiked broth instant noodles with real pieces of meat and is available in two packaging forms: bag and bowl. This type of instant noodles became popular in the Taiwanese market in 2015 and was well received. In 2017, sales in Taiwan exceeded 12 million bowls.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the 2010s, in order to digest 15 years of Huadiao wine inventory, Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Company (TTL) began to develop a series of wine-flavoured instant noodles. In 2012, TTL launched TTL Sesame Oil Chicken Noodles; in 2013, it officially launched TTL Hua Tiao Chicken Noodles. At first, the brand did not receive much attention and it was not until November 2015, when Sigma (Wei Junrong), a food product project manager of Taiwanese Winery, published an article on PTT sharing the deliciousness of TTL Hua Tiao Chicken Noodles that the brand began to attract attention and even became popular. After the article was published, coupled with the cold winter weather, sales increased three to four times in a short period of time. Many retail stores were temporarily out of stock. The three major convenience stores (7-Eleven, Hi-Life and FamilyMart) all stated that sales have increased several times.\n\n\n== See also ==\n \nList of instant noodle brands\nList of noodles\nImperial Big Meal\nWei Lih Men\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to TTL Hua Tiao Chicken Noodles at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Dragline Channel is a man-made channel in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. Originally built by the Hudson's Bay Company in the 1930s, it connects the Old Saskatchewan River Channel to Cut Beaver River at the western end of the Cumberland Marshes. Cut Beaver is a tributary of the Birch River, which in turn is a tributary of the Carrot River. The Dragline Channel connects the Saskatchewan River to the Carrot River watershed. The Carrot River joins the Saskatchewan River downstream, just west of The Pas in Manitoba.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the 1930s, the Hudson's Bay Company leased 130,000 hectares (320,000 acres) from the Saskatchewan government in the Cumberland Marshes. The Cumberland Marshes, also known as the Saskatchewan River Delta, is one of the largest inland deltas in North America. The lease was bounded by the Dragline Channel on the west, Old Saskatchewan River Channel on the north, Birch River on the south, and the Manitoba border on the east. The channel was constructed as part of a greater project by the Hudson's Bay Company to control water levels in the marsh to increase wildlife, specifically the muskrat for the fur trade. The project involved the building of a dam on the Birch River (downstream from Cut Beaver River), the building of Dragline Channel to supply the water, and a series of ditches and small water control structures within the system to distribute the water.\nIn 1960, with the fur trade no longer economically viable enough to justify the upkeep and the needed upgrades to the system, the Hudson's Bay Company gave Ducks Unlimited Canada a 15-year lease over the land. The first thing Ducks Unlimited did was build a major control structure farther downstream on the Birch River, which greatly increased the stored water volume. Ducks Unlimited then built a structure on Dragline Channel to regulate water flows. In 1975, when the 15-year lease expired, the Hudson's Bay Company surrendered the lease rights to Ducks Unlimited, at which point Ducks Unlimited entered into an agreement with the province of Saskatchewan to maintain the land.\n\n\n== Dragline Channel Recreation Site ==\nDragline Channel Recreation Site (53.8332°N 102.9437°W﻿ / 53.8332; -102.9437) is a 30-hectare (74-acre) provincial recreation site at the spot where Dragline Channel connects to the Saskatchewan River. The small park has free camping and access to the river and channel. Access to the site is from Highway 123.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSaskatchewan River fur trade\nList of protected areas of Saskatchewan\nTourism in Saskatchewan\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Can I Hug You, Lover? (Chinese: 我可以抱你嗎？愛人; pinyin: Wǒ kěyǐ bào nǐ ma? Àirén) is the fifth studio album by Taiwanese singer A-Mei. It was released throughout Greater China on June 8, 1999, by Forward Music. There are 12 songs on the album in total, which are produced by David Tao, Ma Yu-fen and Yu Guangyan. The album itself incorporates popular musical genres such as pop, pop rock, R&B, and surf rock.\nCommercially, Can I Hug You, Lover? was a huge success in Asia. The album sold over 500,000 copies in Taiwan within a week of its release and has since amassed sales of 1.18 million copies nationwide. It has also sold over 8 million copies across Asia, making it A-Mei's best-selling album in the continent to date. She performed most of the songs featured in Can I Hug You, Lover? on her Mei Li 99 concert tour in summer 1999, which became the most successful tour by a Mandopop singer up to that point.\n\n\n== Background and production ==\n\nCan I Hug You? Lover is an album tailor-made for A-Mei by a number of music producers, with its production team including musicians such as David Tao, Ma Yu-fen, and Yu Guang-yan. It also features first-time collaborators Johnny Chen and Chen Yaochuan. The album contains 12 songs in all. The lead single \"Can I Hug You\" was customized by Johnny Chen for A-Mei's voice. With his customized sound, from songwriting to production, Chen boldly gave A-Mei the mellow, lyrical track.\nThe song \"When I Secretly Started Thinking of You\" was composed by her late mentor Chang Yu-sheng. \"Don't Rub Salt in the Wound\" was composed by Guo Tzu with lyrics filled in by Wu Yukang, conveying the values of love in the new century, and it is also the theme song of the TV series Gentleman's Orchid Flower. \"Three Days and Three Nights\" is a fast-paced song by Chen Zhihan, which follows her 1998 hit \"Holding Hands,\" targeting A-Mei's wide range of voice power.\nAmong them, the Japanese song \"Want to See You So Much\", was the first Japanese-language song A-Mei ever included on an album. The song was dedicated by bassist Yougan to his wife, Chui Shan Kan, who was studying in Japan, and responded by writing lyrics in Japanese. Their close friend Yu Guangyan wrote \"Don't Care About Him\" with Chinese lyrics of the same song.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nThe album Can I Hug You, Lover? is a more musical and forward-looking piece of music that subverts the listener's visual habits and allows everyone to see A-Mei's different vocal expressions. In the album, A-Mei sings poignant love songs, and the helplessness of a woman's love-destroyed heart when it is broken to the point of being riddled with holes allows her to sing in vivid detail. Compared with the previous albums that featured hot and fast songs, Can I Hug You, Lover? has more or less undergone some changes. For example, A-Mei's voice no longer only wins with strength, but adds a bit of softness and grace. The album's self-titled work, \"Can I Hug You,\" and its seventh track, \"Don't Rub Salt in the Wound,\" transformed A-Mei, who had always been a hot shot on stage, into a fragile woman wounded by love, standing alone with a black umbrella on a continuous rainy day, and singing a sad song in the middle of the pouring rain. At the same time, she did not give up the upbeat songs that she had always been known for performing, and sang \"Give Me Feelings\" as the new spokesperson of a soft drink brand, continuing the familiar path that she always followed.\n\"Can I Hug You\" is completely different from her more cathartic and impassioned approach to love songs in the past. With her quiet and introspective vocals, A-Mei interprets a seemingly cold, but deeply felt emotion, successfully demonstrating a very different lyrical style. The song is a melancholic love song that describes the feeling of leaving, with her unique voice, A-Mei interprets the mature female sentiment of saying goodbye with tenderness, which is difficult to part with, in a way that touches the hearts of the people. The song \"When I Secretly Started Thinking of You\" has the rock elements and straightforward poetic text that Chang Yu-sheng is known for, coupled with A-Mei's explosive raspy voice, pretending to be spontaneous when she falls in love, and full of unwillingness when she is reserved.\nWhen A-Mei interpreted the song \"Don't Rub Salt in the Wound\" with her personalized singing style, it is very close to the mood of modern metropolitan men and women. \"Three Days and Three Nights\" is a kinetic surf rock song with a lot of passion. Furthermore, David Tao's song \"What's So Rare About Love\", which he composed for A-Mei, unfolds his creative prowess in the area of rock. \"No Regrets\" was penned by Chen Chih-yuan and composed by Arys Chien. The song has a more synthesizer heavy arrangement that opens with a softer delivery. \"Goodnight, Goodbye\" is dark pop tune with latin-elements that was written by Wu Yukang and composed by Guo Tzu. \"Run Away From Love\" was written by Daryl Yao and composed by Chen Yaochuan. The song is a power ballad that contains a R&B-influenced pre-chorus. \"Give Me Feelings\" is a bubblegum pop song written by Wu Yukang and Chen Zhihan, while its music was composed by Chen Chih-yuan. \"Sunrise\" is a sunshine pop song that has brighter energy to it, which ties it in with “Give Me Feelings”, but it has a more laid back arrangement. The song was written and composed by Tong Kong.\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nThe standard edition features one CD, which contain twelve songs in total. The standard edition came in two possible album covers; the first being a shot of A-Mei standing in the rain with a black umbrella and the second being a photo of A-Mei in a minidress while posing in front of a white and yellow background. A cassette version of the album was also released by Forward Music.\n\n\n=== Singles and music videos ===\nThe songs \"Give Me Feelings\" and \"Sunrise\" were both originally released on the extended play Feel in April 1999. Both songs were used as advertising jingles for Sprite in China. The music video for \"Give Me Feelings\" was directed by Shao Yuanzhi (邵元智). The music videos for both the songs carry identical storylines from their respective commercials. The first Sprite commercial features \"Give Me Feelings\"; in the first commercial A-Mei leads a throng of young people in a celebration of song and dance in the streets. She then runs into beauty parlors and restaurants, where she pulls off bystanders' masks off and invites them to join in the revelry. The second commercial that features \"Sunrise\" shows A-Mei dancing with her dancers in a dance studio, driving four-wheel ATVs on the beach with her friends, playing basketball in an outside basketball court with a bunch of children and eating seafood and drinking Sprite at a house party; with the final shot of the commercial showing A-Mei asleep on a chair with a puppy in her arm. The first commercial was filmed in Shanghai on the afternoon of January 19, 1999, which resulted in serious traffic jams around the shooting site.\nThe music video for \"Can I Hug You\" was directed by Ma Yizhong (馬宜中). The music video invited director Ma Yizhong to shoot the story of a woman's heart with the same feeling of a woman. This is the first time that A-Mei has worked with a female director, and the first time that she has had a meeting before shooting the music video, and she knew the scene and content beforehand. The director used both unreal and real scenes, and he created a downpour indoors to show the collapse of a woman's inner heart, which is wet, icy, and cold. In addition, two to three hundred men's suits were used to create a space for A-Mei to be trapped in. The music video for \"When I Secretly Started Thinking of You\" was directed by Lai Weikang. The music video for \"Love, What’s Rare?\" was directed by Yu Yongjie (於永傑). The music video for \"Want to See You So Much\" along with its Chinese version \"Don’t Care About Him\" were directed by Lai Weikang, who also directed the video for \"No Regrets.\"\nThe video for \"Don't Rub Salt in the Wound\" was directed by Kuang Sheng (鄺盛). The music video for \"Three Days, Three Nights\" was directed by Wǔ Dù Cíchǎng (五度磁場). The video depicts A-Mei playing the guitar, singing and dancing vehemently in a abandoned building, a bar and on a roadside. The music video for \"Run Away From Love\" was directed by Yuan Xuhu (袁緒虎).\nIn January 2000, the tracks \"Can I Hug You\" and \"Give Me Feelings\" were listed at number 11 and number 66 respectively on the 1999 Hit FM Top 100 Singles of the Year chart.\n\n\n=== Touring ===\n\nIn the summer of 1999, A-Mei held her second Asia-wide concert tour, Mei Li 99, which visited various cities in Taiwan and other Asian cities, including Hong Kong, Singapore, Beijing and Shanghai. She became the first Taiwanese singer to perform at the Shanghai Stadium, with the seats at the venue filled to the brim. It is notable that there were nearly 80,000 attendees attending the live show in Shanghai on August 13, 1999, which made it the most successful concert in that city's history. On August 6, 1999, she became the first artist to perform a concert at Beijing's Workers' Stadium. With more than 60,000 tickets sold, she broke the record for the highest number of spectators for a single performance in the city. More than 50,000 people poured into the two concerts at Hong Kong's now defunct Kai Tak Airport, making her the first and last Taiwanese singer to hold two ticketed concerts there. At the Taipei Municipal Stadium, she became the only female singer to \"open the entire venue\" to a crowd of nearly 50,000 people, thus being regarded as a major benchmark in Taiwan's concert history. A-Mei was also the first to perform in Taitung County by holding a large-scale ticketed concert at the Taitung County Stadium that attracted tens of thousands of people. In Singapore, she also became the first act to perform at the Singapore National Stadium; all the 35,000 tickets at that concert, which was held on September 25, 1999, sold out completely. The Mei Li 99 tour held 14-concerts and attracted about 500,000 spectators, all told.\n\n\n== Accolades ==\nThe album earned A-Mei a nomination for Best Female Singer at the 11th Golden Melody Awards. \"Give Me Feelings\" was one of the winning songs of the 6th Chinese Top 20 Song Awards at the 5th China Music Awards, which was held by Channel V.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Sales and certifications ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Manuel Emilio Díaz Seminario (1828 – 9 October 1906) was a Peruvian naval captain of the 19th century. He was the maternal brother of Peruvian admiral and war hero Miguel Grau Seminario and would be a major figure within the Peruvian Navy during the War of the Pacific.\n\n\n== Military career ==\nEmilio was born as the son of Colombian captain and veteran of the Spanish American Wars of Independence Pío Díaz and María Luisa Seminario who was a part of an influential family within the Department of Piura. His siblings would be his two brothers Miguel, José Anselmo Roberto and his sister Jacoba Balbina. Born into the hacienda of Huangalá which was owned by his maternal grandmother, he would later be baptized on 28 November 1828.\nHe would begin his education by studying at the Colegio de Clemente Noel and would later enroll in the Peruvian Naval School in 1847 as a Gardes de la Marine. In 1850, he would be assigned to the brigantine Guise and in the following year, would serve aboard the French corvette Serieuse, sailing to Oceania and later Europe. After disembarking from Brest, he would return to Peru via the BAP Amazonas which was recently acquired by the Peruvian Navy. In 1855, he would be promoted to First Lieutenant and commanded the schooner Vigilante where he would be a subordinate to his half-brother Miguel./ In 1856, he was made second-in-command of the steamer Ucayali. Later, he was made in charge of the steamer Izcuchaca during the Peruvian Civil War of 1856–1858 as he would remain loyal to the government of Ramón Castilla, in contrast to other naval figures such as Miguel Grau and Lizardo Montero who would side with the rebels. He later participated in the Ecuadorian–Peruvian War within the Blockade of Guayas of 1858 and 1859 which would result in his promotion to Corvette Captain.\nThen promoted to naval Captain, he would participate in the Spanish-South American War within the Battle of Callao on 2 May 1866, stationed at the Real Felipe Fortress under the orders of Ignacio Mariátegui y Tellería. He would remain there indefinitely from 1870 to 1880. During the War of the Pacific in 1880, he was head of the batteries of the fortress. During the Battle of Miraflores, he would be captured by the Chileans but would shortly be released with little word, remaining confined at the Peruvian capital of Lima. After the war, he would be named director of the Navy in 1899. His final position would be a part of the Upper Board of the Navy in 1901, retiring in 1902 due to health-related concerns. He would spend the remainer of his days at Piura until his death on 9 October 1906 in Lima. He would be survived by his son also named Emilio Díaz who was also a naval veteran of the War of the Pacific, serving aboard the BAP Unión.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nde la Puente, José Agustín (2003).

To combat his addiction to video games after college graduation, Espiritu's mom suggested he and his younger brother take up gardening as a hobby. \nEspiritu's first video on Epic Gardening was uploaded in February of 2013, focusing on hydroponics systems. In 2016, he made the decision to leave his position at a book subscription service to cultivate food in backyards while simultaneously developing a gardening blog as a full-time job. As his following expanded, he ventured into YouTube and various other social media platforms, culminating in the establishment of an e-commerce website. He documented online the conversion of his San Diego residence into an eco-friendly smart urban homestead: raising chickens for eggs, reusing rainwater and greywater, composting food and yard scraps, and installing solar panels.\nIn 2019, Espiritu was selected by Timberland as one of their 8 \"Heroes for Nature\" in an international sustainability campaign. In 2021, Espiritu was featured on the Today Show on multiple occasions throughout the year. \nIn January 2022, TCG invested $17.5 million in Epic Gardening. At the end of 2022, Epic Gardening reached 2 million subscribers. The company now has over 80 employees.\nIn 2022, Epic Gardening added Jacques Lyakov of Jacques in the Garden as a guest star on the channel. In January 2023, Epic Gardening acquired Botanical Interests. In February 2023, Epic Gardening posted a video of their greenhouse build at Carrie Underwood's 400-acre home in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nField Guide to Urban Gardening (Cool Springs Press, May 2019)\nGrow Bag Gardening (Cool Springs Press, March 2021)\nEpic Homesteading: Your Guide to Self-Sufficiency on a Modern, High-Tech, Backyard Homestead (Cool Springs Press, January 2024)\n\n\n== See also ==\nCelebrity gardener\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

It is owned by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications of Ireland.\n\n\n== History ==\nLikely built by the O'Brien family in the 1200s, it passed through various owners in the 16th and 17th centuries, including Teige Ó Flaithbheartaigh in 1607. By the 1650s, the original structure had been demolished and a new, enlarged fort was built for Oliver Cromwell, where he stationed soldiers throughout the 1660s. Since the 1700s, it has been uninhabited. Today the ruins include part of a wall and water-gate to the north, a tower at the south-east corner, and a bartizan.\nThe castle is listed on the Record of Monuments and Places as GA119-005---- and National Monument number 43.01.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Fun in a Bakery Shop is a 1902 American short film by Edwin S. Porter. Porter used stop-motion animation to depict clay loaves being sculpted into faces. The film was released on April 3, 1902, by the Edison Manufacturing Company. The film's plot was only the pretext of showcasing the skills of a fast sculptor. \n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film is set in a bakery's interior. A man dressed as a baker kneads dough on a table, which is located next to an oven. He notices a rat crawling up a barrel, and throws dough at the rat. When the rat is completely covered in dough, the baker pummels that dough with his hands. The baker's back is turned towards the camera, obscuring the manipulation of the dough. When he finishes, the dough has turned into a sculptured mask. The baker proceeds to create another mask. Two other bakers then arrive, and notice what he is doing. They grab him, and stick his head into a barrel of flour.The film ends. \n\n\n== Production ==\nIn 1897, plasticine was invented in the United Kingdom. The inventor William Harbutt published a book called Harbutt's Method and Use of Plasticine in the Arts of Writing, Drawing and Modelling in Educational Work, with the intention of providing methods for using plasticine in educational contexts. The book also provided the methods which were used in the animation of clay, claymation. The first use of clay in proto-animation emerged in trick films. \nSeveral early trick films used the concept of the \"lightning cartoonists\", while Fun in a Bakery Shop introduced the concept of the \"lightning sculptor\". While not seen as an actual example of claymation, it paved the way for the use of clay animation in two 1908 film adaptations of the works of Winsor McCay (A Sculptor's Welsh Rabbit Dream and The Sculptor's Nightmare).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nDobson, Nichola (2010), \"Chronology\", The A to Z of Animation and Cartoons, Rowman & Littlefield, ISBN 978-0810876231\nNiver, Kemp R.

        "content": "The Seven-Up Headquarters is a former office building in St. Louis, Missouri that originally served as the home office for the 7 Up company. The National Register of Historic Places listed the structure which has since been converted to the residential Uncola Lofts.\n\n\n== History ==\nCharles Leiper Grigg originally founded the 7 Up company and died in 1940 after which his son, Hamblett Charles Grigg, succeeded him. The company had been renting space in the Shell Building since 1943 but the younger Grigg commissioned Hugo K. Graf to design a prominent headquarters in St. Louis to raise the profile of what was then the third largest soft drink company. The Downtown West site for the building was already owned by 7 Up, as they had purchased a 1927 building to use as a warehouse in 1943. March-Jarvis Builders completed the new headquarters building in 1950.\nBy the mid-1960s, the company moved to a smaller headquarters in suburban Clayton, Missouri and then moved again to Dallas during the late 1970s. In the 1990s, the St. Louis Development Corporation leased the building to the Christian Board of Publication before its sale in 2003. \nThe building then had a residential conversion into 48 units, split between one- and two-bedroom apartments. The residences have been variously branded as the Crown Downtown, the Terrace Lofts, and now the Uncola Lofts.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nGraf designed the three-story International Style office building in a U-shape that incorporates the original 1927 building. The exteriors curtain walls are limestone with a polished black granite base. The fenestration pattern consists of nine bays of windows spanning the width of the building. Cantilevered shields over the windows both help block the morning sun and further emphasize the horizontal lines.\nThe interior portions considered historic consist of the entrance lobby and second floor boardroom, both of which have wood paneling. The Associated General Contractors gave an award celebrating the building's architecture.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of works by Hugo K. Graf\nCoca-Cola Building (St. Louis)\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Downtown and Downtown West St. Louis\n\n\n== References ==",

He ruled five years after his predecessor Hadj Chaouch.\n\n\n== Rule ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\n\nIn 1700 the Algerian Dey Hadj Chaouch was forced to resign from his title of bey when Algerian Janissaries rose up against him, the Diwan of Algiers Decided that  Mustapha would take his place as he was his old Agha at the time.\nThe same year, the Bey of Tunis Murad III launched a campaign against the Beylik of Constantine. Alongside with Zeïdan ben Ismail who also launched a campaign against the Beylik of Mascara and had already begun pillaging cities such as Tlemcen. The Bey of Constantine Ali Khodja Bey was killed by the Tunisians, for the Algerian Counter attack, Hadj mustapha would eventually manage to beat both the invasions in the battles of Jouami' Al-Ulama and Chelif. Even tho the war seemed over, Murad bey would somehow prepare a large army in Kef for a second invasion of Constantine. But this would seem useless as he was assassinated by Ibrahim El-Sharif who just came back from Istanbul to take his place.\n\n\n=== War against Tunisia and death ===\n\nAfter the Maghrebi war, the republic fell into chaos and also in terrible dept and economic instability, the dey would unnecessarily raise taxes as the Italian and Spanish coastal cities became poor. Mustapha believed that the only solution for him was to invade and pillage the neighboring state of Tunis against Ibrahim El-Sharif. After taking the city of Kef and put Tunis in siege, but would eventually lift it after a couple of days after the bey Ibrahim proposed him a ransom of 150,000 Piasters. On his way to the capital, he would be attacked by a small coalition of Kabyles and Tunisians but would suffer from 500 casualties. This delayed the time of arrival of Mustapha, but managed to finally enter the capital in the 12th of October. Even tho he had slaughtered almost an entire army in his way, Algerian janissaries rose up with the lead of Hussein Khodja, Mustapha escaped the city as soon as the revolt broke down. But he would be captured by Janissaries and be paraded on a donkey before being hanged by the rebels.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Gracixalus sapaensis, the Sapa bush frog, is a species of frog in the family Rhacophoridae.  It is endemic to Vietnam and suspected in China. It has been observed between 1250 and 2362 meters above sea level.\nThis frog has been observed in the Fan Si Pan mountains, where it is known in forests and scrubland, though it has occasionally been seen on farms, which suggests it may be able to tolerate a degree of habitat disturbance. The frog is found perched on plants about 2 m above the ground.\nScientists classify this frog as endangered because of its small, threatened range, which is subject to continued degradation as humans build farms and infrastructure for tourism. This range includes at least one protected park: Hoang Lien Son National Park. Climate change may also pose some threat to this frog because it lives in high-elevation habitats that are not readily conducive to northward migration.\nScientists once considered this species a subpopulation of Gracixalus carinensis.\n\n\n== References ==",

As part of it functions the political party of the Local Government Coalition. It was founded on 12 December 2020 by splitting from the Nonpartisan Local Government Activists, and registered on 8 February 2021. Its political party was registered on 22 February 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe National Polish Local Government Coalition was founded on 12 December 2020 as a federation of local government organizations and associations in Poland, by the members of the Nonpartisan Local Government Activists. It was registered on 8 February 2021. Tadeusz Czajka, mayor of Tarnowo Podgórne, became its chairperson, while its deputy chairpeople became Piotr Krzystek, mayor of Szczecin, and Janusz Kubicki, mayor of Zielona Góra. Andrzej Sitnik, mayor of Siedlce, became its secretary, and Ludomir Handzel, mayor of Nowy Sącz. Remaining founding members of its management were Marian Błachut (mayor of Czechowice-Dziedzice), and Jacek Szydło, former mayor of Dywity. In 2023, the management was joined by Patryk Hałaczkiewicz, deputy mayor of Kąty Wrocławskie.\nIn May 2021, the coalition had signed the letter of intent of cooperation with Kraków Suburbia Agreement, represented by mayor of Zabierzów Elżbieta Burtan, as well as the councillers of Kraków County, and the municipality of Zabierzów. In October, the faction of Nonpartisan Local Government Activists in the Szczecin City Council had switched  to the National Polish Local Government Coalition. In April 2022, the coalition had signed the cooperation agreement with Poland 2050 party. In August, it was joined by the Kluczbork Land association, led by Jarosław Kielar, mayor of Kluczbork, together with councillors from the town and Kluczbork County.\nOn 8 December 2022, the parliamentary group of Nonpartisan Local Government Activists in the Lower Silesian Voivodeship Sejmik had joined the coalition, forming the Lower Silesian Local Government Coalition.

        "content": "4'-Hydroxyflavanone is a naturally occurring monohydroxybenzoic acid and a member of the 4'-hydroxyflavanones family. It is white to pale orange in color and generally soluble in organic solvents such as chloroform and ethanol, but insoluble with water. 4'-Hydroxyflavanone is a naturally occurring product with cosmetic and potential clinical applications that is found in plants such as carnations (Dianthus caryophyllus).\n\n\n== Natural occurrence ==\nAs part of the flavanone family, 4'-hydroxyflavanone can be found naturally in celery, red peppers, citrus fruits, parsley (Petroselinum crispum), berries, tea, and onions (Allium cepa L.).\n\n\n== Applications ==\n\n\n=== Cosmetic ===\nFlavanone, with its orange-like color, has been used in natural dyes for cotton fabrics. Additionally, flavanone is used in various anti-wrinkle cosmetics and skin care products to treat psoriasis, melanogenesis, and photo-aging.\n\n\n=== Clinical research ===\n4'-Hydroxyflavanone is an inhibitor of SREBP, transcription factors that control the expression of a range of enzymes that regulate lipid homeostasis.\nResearch also suggests that 4'-hydroxyflavanones have potential pharmaceutic applications against fatty liver disease, hepatic steatosis, and dyslipidemia.\nFlavanones are widely considered to be beneficial to human health as a result of their ability to control free radicals in the body. Flavanones deriving from citrus fruits in particular exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, blood lipid-lowering and cholesterol-lowering agents.\nIn general, flavonoids have been used extensively as anticancer, antimicrobial, antiviral, antiangiogenic, antimalarial, antioxidant, neuroprotective, antitumor, and anti-proliferative agents. Extracts that were rich in flavonoids have also been demonstrated to be ACE inhibitors in vitro, therefore acting as effective antihypertensive agents. They also have been shown to prevent cardio-metabolic disorders and preserve cognitive performance with aging.\n\n\n== Toxicity ==\n4'-Hydroxyflavanone is classified as an irritant due to its ability to cause skin corrosion, eye damage, and respiratory tract irritation if unprotected exposure occurs.\n\n\n== References ==",

The exploit was discovered in December 2023 by researchers at Binarly.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe vulnerability exists when the Driver Execution Environment (DXE) is active after a successful Power On Self Test (POST) in the UEFI firmware (also known as the BIOS). The UEFI's boot logo is replaced with the exploit payload at this point, which can take control of the system.\n\n\n== Patches ==\nIntel patched the issue in Intel Management Engine (ME) version 16.1.30.2307 in December 2023. AMD addressed the problem in AGESA version 1.2.0.b although some motherboard manufacturers did not include the fix under AGESA 1.2.0.c.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCVE-2023-40238\nBinarly analysis of LogoFAIL\n\n\n== References ==",
