Oxenham and Bessie Marchant.\n\n\n== Life ==\nArthur was born and raised in St Pancras, London by his father, Richard Dixon, a grainer, and his mother Rosa. In 1887 his father passed away and Rosa moved with Arthur and his two brothers, Frederick and Herbert to Islington.\nIn 1899, Arthur married Cecil Elsie Soweby in Steyning and together they had one daughter born a year later. The two settled in Berkhamsted until Arthur Dixon passed away in 1959.\n\n\n== Work ==\nArthur was a prolific illustrator in his time and made illustrations for reprints of around thirty-five classic works by Charles Dickens, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Charles Kingsley, Victor Hugo, Elizabeth Gaskell and Washington Irving . The style he employs has been termed 'neo-Pre-Raphaelite' which was indicative of his peers such as Byam Shaw or Eleanor Fortescue-Brickdale.\nHe also exhibited paintings and drawings at such venues as Royal Academy of Arts, Royal Society of British Artists, as well as the New Gallery.\n\n\n=== List of Books illustrated by Arthur A. Dixon ===\nStories from the Bible Illustrated by Arthur Dixon (London: Blackie & Son, 1914)\nScripture Stories For Children Illustrated by Arthur Dixon (London: Blackie & Son, 1915)\nHard Cash By Charles Reade\nThe Poetical Works of Mathew Arnold\nThe Manor House School by Angela Brazil\nChildren's Stories From Russian Fairy Tales (Raphael Tuck & Sons)\nThe Precious Gift by Theodora Wilson Wilson\nA Princess's Token by E.

        "content": "Rodrigo Rossi, also known as Rod Rossi, is a Brazilian singer. After beginning his career in heavy metal bands Snake Eyes and Thorn, he was invited to sing the Brazilian Portuguese version of the opening of Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas, which led him to shift his career focus to the production of anime songs in Brazil.Since then, he has been touring all over Brazil singing Brazilian Portuguese versions of other anime to which he was invited, such as Dragon Ball Kai and Saint Seiya Omega.In 2014, Rossi partnered with Edu Falaschi, Ricardo Cruz and Larissa Tassi to create Cavaleiros in Concert (\"saints in concert\"). They are all known for performing Brazil's opening and ending themes to several Saint Seiya animes, and the project consisted of a series of concerts where they all sang their songs and paid homage to Saint Seiya.In 2016, Rossi took part in the V.A. Animes x Tokusatsu project, in which many artists banded together to play anime songs. Rossi, with Japanese singer Yama-B (former vocalist of Galneryus), recorded a version of Hironobu Kageyama's Soldier Dream, the second opening of Saint Seiya. The duo took the opportunity to record another track for the album Yama-B & Friends called When I Say Goodbye.In 2017, Rossi returned to his heavy metal roots with the album Rec/All, produced by Renato Tribuzy (who also played in it), and special participations by Kiko Loureiro, Roy Z, Edu Ardanuy, Davis Ramay, Marcelo Barbosa, Felipe Andreoli, Marcelo Moreira, Pedro Tinello and Alessandro Del Vecchio.In the same year, Rossi co-founded Danger3 with Larissa Tassi and Ricardo Cruz. The group is dedicated to the production of anime songs and have released four singles with songs inspired by manga published in Brazil, such as Akira and Your Name. The trio also recorded the Brazilian Portuguese versions for the opening and ending themes of Saint Seiya: Soul of Gold, and the song Space Runners, Go, from the Space Runners game.In 2020, Rossi released ANNO: X, a compilation of all anime songs he was officially invited for.He also started a career as a voice actor, having worked on the Brazilian adaptation of animes like Sakamichi no Apollon (Kids on the Slope), Kanojo mo Kanojo (Girlfriend, Girlfriend) and Maou Gakuin no Futekigousha (The Misfit of Demon King Academy).\n\n\n== Discography ==\n2017 Rec/All\n2020 ANNO: X\n\n\n== List of songs in anime and games ==\n\n\n=== Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas ===\n\"O Reino de Atena\" (Original: \"The Realm of Athena\", by EUROX)\n\"Laços de Flor\" (Original: \"Hana no Kusari\", by Maki Ikuno and Marina Del Ray) Obs: sung by Melissa Matos, Rossi worked adapting the lyrics and tends to sing it in his concerts.\n\n\n=== Saint Seiya Omega ===\n\"Pegasus Fantasy versão Ômega\" (Original: \"Pegasus Fantasy ver.

        "content": "The Arnstein family was a noble family from the Saxony-Anhalt region in Germany.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Lords (or Counts) of Arnstein descended from the Swabian von Steusslingen family; their first known member was Walter of Steusslingen (died 1056). Walter was the father of Adalbero, who was in turn father of Werner, Bishop of Münster, and also of Walter I, the first lord of Arnstein in Saxony.  Their family name was originally spelled Arnstedt, but were later called Arnstein, this last name possibly deriving from the castle they owned, or the land they ruled.\n\n\n=== Arnstein Castle and land ===\nIn 1135 they moved to Saxony and built their first known residence: Arnstein Castle, near Aschersleben on the Eastern Harz river. The use of the title Count of Arnstein goes back to the end of the 12th century. In 1289, Walter von Arnstein was burgrave of Freckleben.\nThe Arnstein dynasty owned land in Mühlingen, in the County of Mansfeld, in the Archbishopric of Magdeburg and in Quedlinburg Abbey (of which they were sub-bailiffs). The Counts of Mühlingen and probably also the Counts of Falkenstein are said to have descended from the family.\n\n\n== Feudal divisions of Arnstein ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nIn 1196, the three children of Walter III (1150–1196) and his wife Gertrude of Ballenstedt (granddaughter of Albert the Bear, divided their patrimony:\n\nAlbert I inherited the main county of Arnstein. This main line went extinct after the abdication, in 1292, of the two brothers who were co-ruling at the time; both joined the Teutonic Order. Their possessions were eventually inherited to the noble lords of Schraplau, the princes of Anhalt, the counts of Mansfeld and the Archbishopric of Magdeburg. Johann Siebmacher places the end of the family at the beginning of the 14th century, with Günther von Arnstein's death in 1321\nGebhard inherited the County of Lindow-Ruppin, which went on to make powerful alliances with eastern German lords as the House of Nikloting of Mecklenburg of the House of Griffins from Pomerania, or even the main Electorate of Saxony. The family eventually survived until 1524, when the last member, Wichmann, died with no descendants. The county was inherited by Brandenburg. A relative of Wichmann sued the Imperial Chamber Court against the seizure of the lordship in 1541, but the case was dismissed in 1562.\nWalter IV inherited the Lordship of Barby-Mühlingen, which oriented its alliances to the Anhalt region and, like Lindow-Ruppin, to the main Electorate of Saxony. The count itself, in 1494, stretched from Mühlingen in the west, Walternienburg in the east, Rosenburg in the south and Zackmünde in the north. The lordship was elevated to a county in 1497, and achieved, in the same year, Imperial immediacy.\nThis line was the last to be extinct. After the death of August Louis in 1659, the family's main possessions were inherited by Saxe-Weissenfels and Anhalt-Zerbst.\n\n\n== Coats of arms ==\nThe coat of arms of the main line of the family shows a silver, gold-armored eagle in black or red. \n\nThe branch of Lindow-Ruppin replicates the main line's design, with a silver eagle in red.\nThe branch of Barby-Muhlingen adopts a more different version: in its first and fourth quarters, the family adopts a red eagle in silver; in the second and third ones, it can be seen a silver flower with a golden center in red.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Rulers of Arnstein and its successor states ==\n\n\n=== House of Arnstein ===\n\n\n==== Partitions of Arnstein under Arnstein rule ====\n\n\n==== Table of rulers ====\n(Note: The rulers in the table follow a single counting (as costumary in sources that call Albert X to the count of Barby who died in 1588), in spite of the different parts from where they ruled. This is not, however, a unanimous point of view; some authors choose to individualize the numberings according to the part; that's why, for example, Albert VII of Barby can be also called by some as Albert III).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\n\n\n=== Specific sources ===\nGerd Heinrich: Die Grafen von Arnstein (= Reinhold Olesch, Walter Schlesinger, Ludwig Erich Schmitt [Hrsg.]: Mitteldeutsche Forschungen.

This type of compound is used as a first step in the polishing process of materials that have deep scratches or rough surfaces, as it smooths these scratches with its tough abrasive.\nThe gray compound is an aggressive, first step, cutting compound designed for non ferrous metals. The grey buffing compound is similar to the black  in terms of its aggressiveness but formulated to excel on aluminum, copper, lead, zinc, and tin and other non ferrous metals.\nThe green compound is best for buffing brass, copper, iron, nickel, platinum, and steel. However, it is particularly effective with stainless steel and aluminum. \nThe brown compound is one of the most popular due to its mild cutting action while providing a nice shine as well. Primarily, the bar is used as a cut bar on aluminum, brass, copper, or other soft metals both ferrous and non ferrous.\nThe pink compound is for Acrylic & Plastics  The bar itself is a mild cut, high polishing bar that produces one of the finest finishes for acrylics and plastics. \nThe blue compound is also for Acrylic & Plastics Polishing. The compound is also a mild cut, producing fine finishes for acrylics and plastics. The compound is excellent for edge finishing of acrylic sheeting or restoring a clean finish to solid plastics.\nThe red compound is designed for precious metals.  “Jewelers” polishing is an ultra fine compound designed for work on the most sensitive materials, but including soft non ferrous such as brass or copper as well as the precious metals such as silver and gold.  Jewelers red rouge should be used as a final step in polishing as it has no capacity to cut.\nThe white compound is one of the most common polishing compounds due to its versatility. White rouge can be used for achieving an extremely high luster finish on hard metal surfaces as well as removing extremely minor imperfections on soft metals. It is a finishing compound designed to provide very light cutting edge to softer metals and a brilliant shine to harder metals. The bar can also be used on both ferrous metals, non ferrous metals or plastics.",

        "content": "Eurenco is a explosives, propellors and military fuels based in France. It is a part of the French SOE Agence des Participations de l’Etat. Eurenco has international subsidiaries in Clermont Belgium (formerly part of Poudreries Réunies de Belgique), Karlskoga Sweden and Washington DC, Houston Texas.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2017 the board approved the investment of a €100 million plant in Sorgues (Vaucluse) to make hexogen explosive. Eurenco already has 250 employees there working to make Nitrotriazolone (NTO) powder. Hexogen is less stable than NTO, and so cannot be characterized as an Extremely Insensitive Detonating Substance nor an Insensitive Munition.\nIn July 2020 Nexter placed a big artillery shell order with Eurenco.\nIn July 2023 Eurenco had 1,100 employees and a sales revenue of €300 million.\nIn April 2023 Eurenco relocated its gunpowder plant from Sweden to France.\nIn May 2023 Eurenco restarted a nitrocellulose plant in Bergerac.\nIn October 2023 Eurenco opened an American joint venture subsidiary in Texas.\nIn March 2024 Emmanuel Macron and Sébastien Lecornu visited the Eurenco plant to decorate employees. At the time, it planned to double its production capacity over two years and forecast sales of €1 billion in 2030. It planned to produce 1,200 metric tonnes per year of gunpowder for 155 mm caliber shells, with an investment of €250 million in France. Some support was from the ASAP programme.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Franklin Pierce is a monumental statue on the grounds of the New Hampshire State House in Concord, New Hampshire, United States. The monument, consisting of a bronze statue atop a granite pedestal, honors Franklin Pierce, the only person from New Hampshire to be the president of the United States, serving in the 1850s. It was designed by sculptor Henry Augustus Lukeman and unveiled in 1914.\nThe idea of a statue honoring Pierce was first proposed in 1888 by United States Senator William E. Chandler of New Hampshire. However, the proposal was opposed by Republicans and members of the Grand Army of the Republic, who viewed Pierce, a Democrat, as a bad president whose pro-Southern United States and anti-abolitionist policies contributed to sectional tensions that ultimately led to the American Civil War. Over the next several decades, Republicans, who dominated New Hampshire's politics, blocked numerous attempts to memorialize Pierce. however, a rift in the Republic Party during the 1912 elections gave Democrats control of New Hampshire's government for the first time in several decades, and in 1913, the government finally approved a bill to honor Pierce with a statue on the grounds of the state house. The statue was dedicated on November 25, 1914. According to historian Michael J. Connolly, the statue's creation coincided with a changing view of the Civil War wherein the focus on slavery was downplayed and attention instead focused on national reconciliation.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nFranklin Pierce was born in 1804 as the son of noted New Hampshire politician Benjamin Pierce. In the 1820s, after graduating from Bowdoin College, Pierce entered into a lengthy career in law and politics, and by the late 1830s, he had served stints in the New Hampshire General Court, the United States House of Representatives, and the United States Senate. During the 1852 Democratic National Convention, the Democratic Party nominated Pierce as their candidate for president of the United States, and he was elected in a landslide victory over Winfield Scott, the Whig Party's nominee, in the general election, becoming the nation's 14th president.\nAs president, Pierce became embroiled in controversy due to his support of the Kansas–Nebraska Act, which many anti-slavery advocates in the Democratic Party criticized for allowing the spread of slavery and for heightening sectionalism. Facing charges from abolitionists in the Northern United States that he was a doughface who supported the slave-owning interests of the Southern United States, the Democratic Party declined to renominate Pierce for the 1856 election. After leaving office, Pierce returned to New Hampshire and, during the American Civil War, he openly criticized the Union's war efforts and Abraham Lincoln's handling of the war, prompting many in the Republican Party to consider Pierce a copperhead who supported the Confederate States of America and was opposed to the war. Pierce died in 1869. He was the first and only president to hail from New Hampshire.\nAt the time of his death, historians' opinions of Pierce's legacy were mostly negative. Historians largely viewed the actions of Pierce and his presidential successor, James Buchanan, as contributing to heightening tensions that ultimately led to civil war. Critics of his accused him of compromising his morals in order to placate Southern interests with regards to slavery, while supporters of his largely attempted to justify his actions as a result of political pragmatism and party loyalty rather than an indication of some moral failing or poor judgement.\n\n\n=== Early memorial efforts ===\n\nBeginning in 1860 and lasting into the 1910s, the Republican Party was the dominant political party in New Hampshire and counted among their members many Union Army veterans, including members of the Grand Army of the Republic. As a result, in 1888, when Senator William E. Chandler of New Hampshire first proposed the erection of a memorial for Pierce, the measure was vociferously opposed by Republicans on the grounds of both not wanting to honor a noted Democratic politician as well as an individual who had been vehemently opposed to the Union's war efforts. In the ensuing years, the view of the Grand Army of the Republic's members largely held that Pierce had been a traitor, with one veteran from Claremont, New Hampshire, calling him \"a lasting disgrace to New Hampshire\", and Republicans blocked many future efforts to erect a statue to Pierce.\nIn 1893, Chandler, a Republican, led a campaign to erect two statues in the National Statuary Hall of the United States Capitol. Chandler promised Democratic politicians in the state that, if they would support his measure, he would support their campaign for a statue of Pierce to be erected on the grounds of the New Hampshire State House in Concord, New Hampshire, though while the National Statuary Hall bills passed into law, Republican legislators blocked passage of the bill for the Pierce statue. In 1901, Chandler, attempting to keep his promise to the Democratic politicians, again pushed for a monument to be erected of Pierce, but again to no avail. During the 1909 legislative session, the Republican-dominated legislature again rejected a bill to fund a public statue of Pierce, as well as a different bill which would have honored Pierce and his father by naming a bridge across the Merrimack River in Concord the \"Pierce Memorial Bridge\".\nIn 1911, another Pierce statue bill was approved by the legislature's Committee on Public Improvements and in late February came to the floor of the New Hampshire House of Representatives for discussion. This bill was sponsored by Representative Irad E. Keeler of Concord, a Republican, and led to a split in the Republican Representatives. While Keeler supported the statue primarily on the grounds of national reconciliation and in honoring a favorite son, other Republicans in the House, including many members of the Grand Army of the Republic, opposed the bill for similar reasons to in past debates. One representative stated that he would not consider any monument to Pierce until monuments honoring New Hampshire's war dead were erected on every Civil War battlefield in the Southern United States, while another sarcastically questioned whether the new monument should read \"our only President\" or \"our disgrace\". The height of the debate came on February 22 when Representative Rosecrans W. Pillsbury stated, \"it was a poor time—on Washington's birthday—to press a measure for the erection of a monument to a traitor\". The discussions elicited responses from the press, with the Concord Daily Patriot newspaper suggesting a statewide referendum on the statue, while the Concord Daily Monitor printed a letter to the editor from Edgar Aldrich, a United States federal judge, who expressed dismay at the legislators' insults. Despite the debates, the bill passed through the Committee on Appropriations and managed to pass with a vote in the House on April 4, but was promptly rejected in a 10—6 vote in the New Hampshire Senate on April 10. Following this, the Daily Patriot floated the idea of a public subscription campaign in order to raise funds for the statue.\n\n\n=== 1913 monument bill ===\nDuring the 1912 United States elections, a rift within the Republican Party concerning its more progressive members helped the Democratic Party, leading to the election of Woodrow Wilson as only the second Democratic president since the end of the Civil War. In New Hampshire, Democrats took control of both chambers of the legislature and the governorship, prompting the Daily Patriot to write in January 1913 that they expected a Pierce statue bill to pass that legislative session. On January 7, Representative Guy H. Cutter proposed a bill allocating $15,000 (equivalent to $462,000 in 2023) in state funds to the erection of a monument on the state house grounds honoring Pierce, and with support from other legislators, such as Chandler, the bill quickly passed through the Committee on Public Improvements. Unlike in previous sessions, critics against the statue were less concerned with Pierce's legacy and focused more on financial considerations. Local newspapers argued that a more economical way of honoring Pierce would be in the naming of a new government building or mountain, and in February of that year, in partial response, the government passed a bill naming one of the White Mountains Mount Pierce. On May 13, the bill, having passed through both chambers of the legislature, was signed into law by New Hampshire Governor Samuel D. Felker.\nAccording to historian Michael J. Connolly, the passage of the monument bill coincided with a general reevaluation of Pierce that was occurring during the early 20th century, with historians' views of Pierce that focused on his political pragmatism and adherence to rule of law. According to Connolly, the reevaluation was fueled primarily by Progressive Era anxieties regarding society and race relations, and in this atmosphere, some historians attributed to Pierce \"a superior wisdom, an admirable level-headedness in a hyper-emotional age, and a practical political sense more in tune with humans as they were, rather than abolition's idealistic and dogmatic fantasies on how they should be\". Connolly also points to two recent events, the federal funding of a monument to President John Tyler in 1911 and the 1913 Gettysburg reunion, as contributing to the bill's passage, as both events aligned with the Pierce statue supporters' focus on national reconciliation and political harmony.\n\n\n=== Creation ===\n\nOn July 11, the governor created the Pierce Statue Committee in order to oversee the monument's erection, appointing to the committee several politicians and businessmen, including Aldrich and Chandler. Henry F. Hollis, a newly-elected Democratic Senator from New Hampshire, and his brother, Allen, urged the committee to select sculptor Daniel Chester French, their uncle, to design the monument. French, a New Hampshire native, said he would be willing to design the statue, but that he would need three years to complete the work due to preexisting projects of his, which was considered outside of the schedule set by the committee. Instead, French joined the committee and recommended for the position Henry Augustus Lukeman, a New York City-based sculptor. Lukeman was considered a protégé of both French and fellow sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens. On November 7, Lukeman met with the committee and, after discussing plans and inspecting the state house grounds, the committee voted to extend an invitation for Lukeman to submit a model of his design for their consideration.\nIn designing the statue, Lukeman consulted Kirk D. Pierce, Pierce's nephew. On December 31, Lukeman presented a model of his statue to the committee at the New Hampshire Historical Society, the design of which the committee accepted. Reports in January 1914 stated that the full-size statue was expected to be completely executed by October 15 of that year. Casting of the statue was carried out by Jno. Williams, Inc. of New York City. Meanwhile, several committee members worked with Governor Felker to decide the location of the statue on the state house grounds and the inscriptions that would appear on the statue's pedestal. In addition to the statue itself, Lukeman also worked on the overall design of the surrounding area, including the installation and design of several nearby electroliers. In total, the monument cost $14,500 (equivalent to $441,000 in 2023).\n\n\n=== Dedication ===\nControversy arose over plans for the dedication ceremony concerning the invited guests. In an attempt to highlight the healing of the rift between the northern and southern states following the Civil War, Governor Felker suggested inviting a Southern Democrats, prompting him to extend an invitation to President Wilson, a native of Virginia. Senator Hollis told the governor that Senator Hoke Smith of Georgia would be willing to speak at the ceremony, while Republican Senator Jacob H. Gallinger invited Francis S. White, a former senator from Alabama and veteran of the Confederate States Army. This prompted Otis G. Hammond, the director of the New Hampshire Historical Society, to write to Chandler concerning White's involvement, saying it was \"a serious error, serving only to revive a sectional feeling which has happily subsided ... These old charges of copperheadism [sic] against the President, unjust and unreasonable, have now somewhat subsided, and I should think it was hardly the best of judgment to revive them again\". Ultimately, neither White nor Wilson attended the ceremony.\nThe monument was dedicated on November 25, 1914, with several hundred spectators attending the ceremony in spite of poor weather that day. Ceremonies commenced at 11 a.m. with a procession from the Eagle Hotel to the site of the statue on the state house grounds. Music for the event was provided by Nevers' Third Regiment Band. Politician Clarence E. Carr served as the president of the event, which featured speeches from Oliver Ernesto Branch, Aldrich, Chandler, Felker, and Carr himself, among others. The statue was unveiled by Susan Pierce, a grandniece of Franklin's. According to Connolly, there was a lack of consistency regarding Pierce's legacy, as speakers alternated in offering praise and criticism of the former president. Additionally, Connolly states that, as with the 1913 Gettysburg reunion, the ceremony contained \"racial significance\", as Pierce's rehabilitation during this time was part of a broader era of heightened racial tension in the United States.\n\n\n=== Later history ===\n\nIn 1994, the statue was surveyed as part of the Save Outdoor Sculpture! initiative. In 2020, amidst the nationwide George Floyd protests and calls from some students at the University of New Hampshire to remove Pierce's name from the name of the university's School of Law, the Concord Monitor published an opinion piece from historian and editor emeritus Mike Pride wherein he discussed the statue's possible removal or relocation.\n\n\n== Design ==\n\nThe monument consists of a bronze sculpture showing Pierce dressed in typical 1850s clothing, including a long dress coat, a bow tie, and a military cloak. He is standing with his right leg extended outward, with his left hand on his hip and his right hand resting on a pedestal consisting of a fasces draped with the American flag. The statue weighs 2,230 pounds (1,010 kg) and stands approximately 8 feet (2.4 m) tall, with side measurements of 55 inches (140 cm) by 38 inches (97 cm), while the granite pedestal supporting the sculpture is approximately 63 inches (160 cm) tall and has side measurements of 62 inches (160 cm) by 48 inches (120 cm). The bronze base of the statue contains markings from both the sculptor (\"AUGUSTUS LUKEMAN Sc. / 1914\") and the foundry (\"JNO. WILLIAMS INC. FOUNDERS N.Y.\").\nThe monument is located on a brick plaza that is set two steps above the surrounding sidewalk and is surrounded by a granite curb on its sides and rear. This plaza takes the general form of an exedra from Ancient Greek architecture, covering an ovular shape with a depth of 12 feet (3.7 m) and a width of 35 feet (11 m). On either end of this exedra are granite pedestals supporting bronze electroliers. The pedestal bears the following inscriptions:\n\nFRANKLIN PIERCE / FOURTEENTH / PRESIDENT / OF THE / UNITED STATESBORN AT HILLSBOROUGH, NEW HAMPSHIRE / NOVEMBER 23, 1804 / A LAWYER WHO LOVED HIS PROFESSION / AND WAS A GREAT LEADER IN IT / MEMBER OF NEW HAMPSHIRE LEGISLATURE / AT 25 AND SPEAKER AT 27 / CONGRESSMAN AT 29 / UNITED STATES SENATOR AT 32 AND / RESIGNED AT 37 / LATER IN LIFE DECLINED THE OFFICE OF / ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED / STATES, THAT OF SECRETARY OF WAR, / THE UNITED STATES SENATORSHIP, AND / THE GOVERNORSHIP OF HIS STATE. / PRESIDENT OF THE NEW HAMPSHIRE / CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION / PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES / DIED AT CONCORD OCTOBER 8, 1869.BRIGADIER GENERAL U.S.A. / PUEBLA / CONTREARAS / CHERUBUSCO / MOLINO DEL REY / CHAPULTEPEC / COMMISSIONER APPOINTED BY GENERAL / SCOTT TO ARRANGE AN ARMISTICE / WITH GENERAL SANTA ANNA / 'HE WAS A GENTLEMAN AND A / MAN OF COURAGE.' / ULYSSES S. GRANTERECTED BY THE / STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE / 1914\n\nThe monument is situated on the southern grounds of the state house, south of the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Arch. It was erected to the east of an existing statue of John P. Hale, an abolitionist politician and contemporary of Pierce's, who has his hand outstretched towards the Pierce statue. In 1915, during a visit to Concord, the editor of the Boston Herald asked Chandler if the placement had been a deliberate choice in showing Hale condemning Pierce. Chandler acknowledged the coincidence, but denied any intention, further responding to the editor, \"I must insist that the arm does not point the accusing finger, but the hand of friendship. Will you accept the idea?\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of sculptures of presidents of the United States\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"The Franklin Pierce statue commission of New Hampshire...\" The Building News and Engineering Journal.

        "content": "The Sabaneta prison fire was a fire that occurred on 3 January 1994 in a prison in Maracaibo, Venezuela, in which at least 108 inmates died. It is the tragedy that caused the most deaths in the country's prison history.\n\n\n== Fire ==\nIt was estimated that the fire was set with gasoline by one of two warring groups in the prison and the gang \"Los Goajiros\" was blamed for it. However, Diario República reported that an internal source revealed that the day before an inmate had been decapitated and that soccer was played with his head, an event that had occurred before in December 1990; according to the source, the event infuriated the fellow inmates and they waited for the night to chain the exit doors and cause the fire. The fire demonstrated the shortcomings of the Venezuelan penal system and led to urgent decisions, including the intervention of the Sabaneta prison and criminal actions against the prison guards.\n\n\n== See also ==\n2018 Valencia, Venezuela fire\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Plantago picta is a species of flowering plant in the family Plantaginaceae that is endemic to New Zealand. William Colenso described P. picta in 1890. Plants of this species of plantain are perennial with a rosette habit, leaves widest above the middle, up to 5 ellipsoid seeds per capsule, and bracts with hairs along the edges but otherwise glabrous. Its conservation status is At Risk – Naturally Uncommon.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nPlantago picta Colenso is in the plant family Plantaginaceae. New Zealand botanist William Colenso described P. picta in 1890.\n\nThe type material was collected by H. Hill on \"Island near Gable End Foreland\", North Island, New Zealand. The lectotype was designated by Heidi Meudt and is housed at the herbarium (WELT) of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa with an isolectotype at the herbarium (K) of the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew.\nPlantago picta is morphologically most similar to P. spathulata, P. raoullii and P. udicola. P. picta and P. spathulata were once considered subspecies.\nP. picta can be distinguished from P. spathulata by the length of the hairs on the on bract edges (minute and 0.1–0.3 mm long vs. long and obvious and 0.3–1.1 mm long); the width of the darkened area on sepal (>50% vs. <50% total sepal width); and size classes of seeds (of two different size classes vs. of one uniform size).\nPlantago picta E.Morris was described in 1901 and is an illegitimate name, since it was published after P. picta Colenso, and is a synonym for a South American plant, P. patagonica.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nPlantago picta plants are small rosettes with a primary root up to 13 mm thick, with up to 50 usually narrowly obovate or obovate leaves, and with visible, short (<15 mm long), rust-coloured leaf axillary hairs in the basal rosette. The leaves have 1–3 veins, are 10–93 mm long (including petiole) and up to 28 mm wide, not punctate, usually glabrous or with patchy, isolated hairs or sparsely hairy on the upper surface, and usually glabrous or with isolated hairs on the midrib of the lower surface. The leaf usually has an obtuse apex, and its edges are smooth or wavy or with up to 10 minute or small teeth, and with isolated hairs or sparsely hairy especially near the teeth. The petiole is sometimes distinguishable from the leaf lamina, and up to 36 mm long. Each rosette plant has up to 21erect inflorescences which can be up to 210 mm long. The scapes are smooth and sparsely to densely hairy. The spikes are usually linear-ovoid with 5–30 densely crowded flowers. Each flower has 1 small bract that is ovate, broadly ovate or very broadly ovate and sparsely hairy along the edges. The calyx is 2.6–3.5 mm long, 1.8–3.8 mm wide, and sparsely hairy on the lobe edges. The corolla tube is 1.4–3.3 mm long, corolla lobes 1.3–2.2 mm long, stamen filaments 3.2–7.5 mm long, anthers 1.9–2.3 mm long, and style 2.7–6.3 mm long and densely hairy. The ovary is 0.8–2.1 mm long, with 4 or 5 ovules. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule with circumsessile dehiscence, usually ellipsoid, globose, anbular obovoid or broadly angular obovoid, widest at middle, 2.1–4.3 mm long and 1.6–3.0 mm wide. Each capsule has 2–5 rust, brown or dark brown seeds 0.7–2.3 mm long, of two size classes, usually ellipsoid, broadly ellipsoid or globose with rounded edges.\nPlantago picta flowers from December to January and fruits from December to March.\nThe chromosome number of Plantago picta is 2n=48.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n\nPlantago picta is a plantain that is endemic to the Gisborne region of the North Island of New Zealand.\nIt grows on bare coastal cliffs made of sandstone or mudstone from 0–50 m above sea level.\n\n\n== Phylogeny ==\nin phylogenetic analyses of Australasian species of Plantago using standard DNA sequencing markers (nuclear ribosomal DNA, chloroplast DNA, and mitochondrial DNA regions) and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), Plantago picta was moderately to strongly supported as being closely related to the mainland New Zealand species P. spathulata, P. raoulii and P. udicola.\nSimilarly, the sole individual of P. picta was closely related to individuals of P. raoulii, P. spathulata and P. udicola in another phylogenetic study focusing on Plantago species throughout the world using whole chloroplast genomes. Finally, the species was not included in another phylogenetic studies focusing on oceanic island Plantago species using standard DNA sequencing markers.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nPlantago picta is listed as At Risk – Naturally Uncommon in the most recent assessment (2017–2018) of the New Zealand Threatened Classification for plants.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Plantago picta at Wikimedia Commons\nPlantago picta occurrence data from Australasian Virtual Herbarium",

        "content": "The 1857 Georgia gubernatorial election was held on October 5, 1857, in order to elect the Governor of Georgia. Democratic nominee and state circuit court judge Joseph E. Brown defeated Know Nothing (Sam) nominee and State legislator Benjamin Harvey Hill.\nBrown was a relatively unknown figure in Georgia politics before his governorship, with his victory over John H. Lumpkin, a close associate of former governor Howell Cobb, for the Democratic nomination shocking many people, with Robert Toombs reportedly asking \"who the devil is Joe Brown\" upon hearing his nomination.\nBrown grew up poor and was not a planter, only owning 13 slaves. A self-made man, he went Yale University to study law and became a lawyer in Canton. Over half his assets came in stock and bonds (including railroad securities) and less than a fourth of his wealth resulted from his ownership of slaves. Additionally, the district that had elected him was in the mountain region of Georgia where very few owned slaves.\nBrown's victory over Hill in the general election, as commented by one writer, \"was in its moral effect similar to the accession of Andrew Jackson to the Presidency in 1828 - a shock to the aristocratic regime in Georgia.\"\n\n\n== General election ==\nOn election day, October 5 1857, Democratic nominee Joseph E. Brown won the election by a margin of 10,835 votes against Know Nothing (Sam) nominee Benjamin Harvey Hill, thereby continuing Democratic control over the office of Governor. Johnson was sworn in for his first of four terms on November 6, 1857. \n\n\n=== Results ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Erich Wagner (15 September 1912 – 22 March 1959) was a German-Austrian SS-Sturmbannführer and camp doctor in the Buchenwald concentration camp.\n\n\n== Life ==\nWagner was born on 15 September 1912 in Komotau, Austria-Hungary (now Chomutov, Czech Republic). After completing his school career, Wagner studied medicine at the University of Graz and Innsbruck, among others, and completed his studies in December 1938 with the state examination. Even before Austria's annexation to the German Reich in March 1938, he was involved with the NSDAP and SS, \n which were banned in Austria. Wagner then attended an SS Junkers school and received his license to practice medicine. In November 1939, Wagner was employed as a camp doctor in the Buchenwald concentration camp, where he worked until January 1941.\n\nFrom the fall of 1940 onwards, SS-Hauptsturmführer Müller worked in pathology, [...] Müller worked with the camp doctor Dr. Wagner, who wrote a doctoral thesis about tattoos. Both searched the entire camp for tattooed people and had them photographed. The prisoners were then called to the gate by Commander Koch, selected based on the splendor of their tattooed skin and sent to the infirmary. Soon afterwards, the best skin specimens appeared in the 'Department of Pathology', where they were prepared and shown to SS visitors for years as special treasures.\nEugen Kogon - The SS state: The system of the German concentration camps - Kindler, Reinbek near Hamburg 1974, p. 161f\nIn June 1940, his thesis, A Contribution to the Tattoo Question was accepted by Friedrich Timm, who had been head of the Institute for Forensic Medicine and Scientific Criminology at the University of Jena since 1938 . At the end of November 1940, Wagner submitted his dissertation, which was later rated “very good”. Wagner graduated with a medical doctorate in September 1941. For this study, 800 tattooed Buchenwald prisoners were examined according to reasons for imprisonment, origin, motivation for tattooing and type of tattoo. In particular, connections between “tattoos and criminality” should be researched. The work was probably mainly written by the Buchenwald prisoner Paul Grünewald and was only accompanied by Wagner. However, the University of Jena was not aware of this.\nThe prisoner Gustav Wegerer, a Viennese chemical engineer and Kapo in the pathology department of the Buchenwald concentration camp, later said the following: “The SS doctor Dr. Wagner did a dissertation on tattoos, and it was noticeable that the prisoners he ordered died and their tattoos were removed. It can be assumed that he liquidated them in the hospital.”  Ilse Koch, wife of the camp commandant Karl Otto Koch, was probably inspired by this work to collect objects made from prepared skin.\nAfter his deployment in Buchenwald, Wagner was probably employed as a troop doctor in Waffen-SS formations . At the end of the war, Wagner was taken prisoner by the Americans, from which he was able to escape in 1948. He lived undetected in Bavaria for six years under a pseudonym . From 1957 he practiced in his wife's medical practice in Lahr/Black Forest until he was arrested in 1958. Wagner was ultimately charged with the Offenburg regional court for his crimes committed in Buchenwald and committed suicide while in custody in Oberkirch prison in March 1959.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nErnst Klee: Auschwitz, Nazi medicine and its victims. 3rd edition.

It has trifoliate leaves at the base of the plant and cream-coloured flowers in a compound umbel with 3 or 4 rays.\n\n\n== Description ==\nXanthosia peduncularis is a spreading perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 15 cm (5.9 in). Its leaves are trifoliate, arranged at the base of the plant, the leaflets linear or wedge-shaped. The flowers are arranged in a compound umbel with the flowers arranged in 3 or 4 rays and a few central flowers. There are narrow involucral bracts that are longer than the flowers and the sepals are heart-shaped. Flowering occurs from September to November. \n\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\nXanthosia peduncularis was first formally described in 1867 by George Bentham in his Flora Australiensis from specimens collected by James Drummond. The specific epithet (peduncularis) means \"pedunculate\".\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThis species of xanthosia grows in gravelly sand in the Esperance Plains bioregion of southern Western Australia.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nXanthosia peduncularis is listed as \"Priority Three\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions, meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Derdas II (Ancient Greek: Δέρδας) was the ruler of the region of Elimiotis (Ἐλιμιώτις), also rendered as Elymia (Ἐλιμία) and Elimeia (Ἐλίμεια), in the early 4th century BCE.  Elimiotis was a client state of Macedon.\n\nThe year 394/3 was a time of dynastic uncertainty in Macedon.  The Macedonian king Aëropus, who had usurped the throne in 398/7 died this year of an illness and was succeeded by his son Pausanias.  His reign was short, as we learn from Diodorus Siculus:Pausanias too, the king of the Macedonians, died after a reign of one year, being assassinated by Amyntas, who seized the kingship and reigned twenty-four years.In this report Diodorus missed a step.  Pausanias was, indeed, killed by \"Amyntas\", but not the man who reigned for twenty-four years.  Aristotle, in a discussion of royal assassinations, said in his Politics:Any sort of insult (and there are many) may stir up anger, and when men are angry, they commonly act out of revenge, and not from ambition. For example… Amyntas the Little [was killed] by Derdas, because he boasted of having enjoyed his youth.Scholars today give Aristotle credit for knowing the order events better than Diodorus, primarily because he lived at the Macedonian court only a few years after these events and would have known many of the witnesses.  The accepted conclusion is that Amytas the Little (who was the son of either the rebellious Philip discussed above or his brother Menelaus) was, in turn, eliminated by Amyntas, son of Arrhidaeus, from another branch of the royal family (who became Amyntas III).  Rather than do the deed himself, Amyntas III prevailed upon Derdas, a scion of the ruling family of Elimiotis, and probably either the son or grandson of Derdas I to act for him. Aristotle's comment suggests that Derdas already had reasons to resent Amyntas the Little.\nDerdas II was later an active participant in a four-year campaign (382–379) waged by Sparta against Olynthus, the leading city of the Chalcidike, which was attempting to build a league of cities on that peninsula.  Two cities under pressure to join, Akanthos and Apollonia, sought help from Sparta in resisting this threat.  Sparta, having assumed responsibility for keeping the peace throughout Greece since defeating Athens in the Peloponnesian War, committed to the project of reining in Olynthus.\n\nDuring the next four summers, Sparta repeatedly sent armies north to the region to attack Olynthus.  In this effort, they sought troops from within the Peloponnese, Boeotia, Thessaly and Macedon.  Among those from the last was a four-hundred man cavalry under the command of Derdas, “ruler of Elimeia”.  In the first summer, it appears that Derdas' participation was somewhat reluctant.  When mounting an attack on Olynthus, the Spartan commander Teleutias stationed Derdas and his cavalry:next to himself on the left… He did this both because he admired this cavalry unit and because he wished to honor Derdas, so that he would be glad he had joined the expedition. The attack faltered at one point and the entire force would probably been defeated if Derdas had not immediately advanced toward the gates of the city with his entire cavalry force… The Olynthian cavalry realized what was happening and, becoming afraid they would be cut off from the gates, turned about and returned to the city in great haste.  And that is where Derdas killed a great number of the cavalry as they attempted to pass by him…Olynthos was not defeated, however, and the next summer (381) Derdas anticipated the renewal of campaign by taking his cavalry to Apollonia in the spring.  The Olynthians chose to attack the city before the Spartan army arrived, but as they approached the gates, Derdas counterattacked, routing them and chasing them all the way back to Olynthos itself.  After this, the Olynthians kept close to home.\nThe campaign went on for another two summers, but eventually the Olynthians sued for peace (379) and made a formal alliance with Sparta.\n\n\n== Notes ==",

        "content": "The 1992 Peruvian embassy attack in Stockholm was a terrorist attack carried out by the Shining Path on the Bolivian embassy in the city of Lima, Peru. The attack took place as part of an offensive policy of \"armed general strike\" by the Shining Path against the government of Alberto Fujimori. The attack left up to 16 people injured, including locals and Bolivian embassy personnel.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAt the beginning of 1992, the Shining Pathsw leadership planned an offensive to undermine national power and internationally degrade the image of Alberto Fujimori, who was due to attend the 2nd Ibero-American Summit in Madrid. By 1992, Fujimori already had bad relations with the majority of the international Hispanic community due to his heavy-handed policy and excesses in the repression of the communist insurgency.\n\n\n== Attack ==\nOn July 22, a car bomb exploded around noon near the embassy, causing great material damage and six people to be injured, including Peruvian civilians and Bolivian embassy personnel. The Peruvian Foreign Ministry reported that the attack was part of Shining Path operations during its so-called \"armed general strike\".\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nA Latin American diplomat, upon visiting the rubble of the embassy, expressed that \"Lima gives the impression of being under the siege of a virtual civil war.\"\nThe government of the then Republic of Bolivia demanded compensation and reparations from the Peruvian government for the attack. Some time later, the Peruvian State agreed to the Bolivian requests. These conversations ended up giving rise to the commodate of Bolivia Mar in the department of Moquegua, a commercial enclave.\n\n\n== See also ==\nJapanese embassy hostage crisis, which took place nearby\nTarata bombing, which took place on the same year\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Vilius Gaigalaitis or Wilhelm Gaigalat (27 September 1870 – 30 November 1945) was a Lutheran priest and Prussian Lithuanian activist. He was a member of the Prussian House of Representatives (1903–1918), director of the consistory of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Lithuania (1925–1933), and professor at Vytautas Magnus University (1925–1936).\nEducated at the University of Königsberg, Gaigalaitis was ordained priest and received doctorate in philosophy in 1900. He worked as pries in Ramučiai (1900–1902), Priekulė (1902–1915), and Katyčiai (1915–1919). As a representative of the Lithuanian Conservative Election Societies, Gaigalaitis was elected to the Landtag of Prussia in 1903, 1908, and 1913. He aligned with the German Conservative Party and defended the use of the Lithuanian language in schools and churches. During World War I, he supported Lithuania's independence and the idea of uniting Lithuania Minor with Lithuania Proper. In 1918, he was elected chairman of the National Council of Lithuania Minor but did not sign the Act of Tilsit. After Lithuania gained control of the Klaipėda Region in January 1923, Gaigalaitis became a member of the Directorate of the Klaipėda Region but resigned within a year due to disagreements and withdrew from further political work.\nGaigalaitis was a member and co-founder of numerous cultural and educational Lithuanian societies. He was the long-term chairman of the Sandora Society and editor of its newspaper Pagalba. After World War I, he worked on establishing Lithuanian schools. He taught at the Faculty of the Evangelical Theology at Vytautas Magnus University from its establishment in 1925 to its closure in 1936. In 1925, he became the director of the consistory of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Lithuania and took measures against pro-German priests.\nVarious Lithuanian schools and societies were liquidated after Lithuania lost Klaipėda Region to Nazi Germany in March 1939, destroying Gaigalaitis' life's work. He retreated to Lithuania and then to Germany where he died in Bretten in 1945. In total, Gaigalaitis published 25 books, including a study on Gemeinschaftsbewegung (Community Movement) among Prussian Lithuanians and the first Lithuanian-language work on poet Kristijonas Donelaitis.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life and education ===\nBorn on 27 September 1870, Gaigalaitis was the youngest of nice children in a family of farmers in Naujienos (German: Heydebruch; present-day Naujininkai in Pagėgiai Municipality) near Vilkyškiai The village was then part of East Prussia which had a large Lithuanian-speaking minority of Prussian Lithuanians. The family owned 300 morgens of land (76.5 hectares or 189 acres). The family was affluent and Gaigalaitis sometimes presented himself as a son of petty nobility.\nGaigalaitis attended a primary school in Žukai starting in 1877. His first known article (a translation from German about Christian missionaries) was published in Keleivis supplement of Konzervatyvų draugystės laiškas in 1884 (at the age of 14). In 1886, he was tutored for nine months by priest Jonas Pipiras and successfully passed entrance examination to the Louise Gymnasium in Memel (now Klaipėda). A year later, he transferred to the realgymnasium in Tilsit (now Sovetsk) where, according to his memoirs, he organized a secret student group Baltija. In Tilsit, Gaigalaitis became acquainted with other Lithuanian activists, particularly those working to publish Varpas, and began contributing more actively to the Lithuanian press.\n\n\n=== University studies ===\nAfter graduating high school in 1892, Gaigalaitis chose to study theology and philosophy at the University of Königsberg. He also took classes on comparative linguistics, history, Lithuanian language. Linguistic professor Adalbert Bezzenberger had a formative influence on Gaigalaitis. In November 1894, he joined the Prussia Antiquity Society. He studied for six months at the University of Berlin (there is conflicting information whether he studied linguistic or agricultural subjects).\nTo become a priest, Gaigalaitis had to pass two examinations – pro licentia concionandi (for delivering sermons) an pro ministerio (for the ministry). There was a mandatory 18-month waiting period between these exams. During this time, Gaigalaitis attended six-week courses at the teacher's seminary in Ragnit (now Neman) and taught in primary schools.\nIn June 1900, he received doctorate of philosophy from the University of Königsberg for his thesis on the Wolfenbütteler Postil (newly discovered Lithuanian manuscript from 1573). Gaigalaitis chose the topic under the influence of Adalbert Bezzenberger who helped him obtain financial assistance from the German government. The thesis was published in the journal of the Lithuanian Literary Society. It was a linguistic, not theological work.\n\n\n=== Career ===\n\n\n==== Religion ====\nGaigalaitis was ordained priest in June 1900. He accepted a position as an assistant priest (Hilfsprediger) in Eidaičiai, but it was a small and remote village with no church. When a small church was built in nearby Ramučiai, Gaigalaitis relocated there (a Lutheran parish in Ramučiai was established in 1902). In April 1902, he became the second priest of the much larger and more established parish in Priekulė. In 1904, Endrikis Endrulaitis became the first priest of the parish. He was active in the Lithuanian press and collaborated with Gaigalaitis, but was skeptical of the Lithuanian National Revival. In October 1915, Gaigalaitis became priest in Katyčiai. Due to increased social and political involvement, he left active pastoral work in March 1919. He then moved to Memel (Klaipėda) where he lived until 1940.\nIn June 1925, Gaigalaitis was elected by the synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Lithuania to the church's consistory. Despite protests from the German and Latvian members of the congregation, President of Lithuania appointed Gaigalaitis as president of the consistory. He served in this position until 1933 and took measures against pro-German priests. For such policies, Gaigalaitis was frequently attacked by German priests. In 1928, Kurt Ballerstedt published a brochure Die evangelisch-lutherische Kirche in Litauen im Kampf um ihre Freiheit (The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Lithuania in the Fight for its Freedom) with a foreword by Gustav Adolf Deissmann. Gaigalaitis responded by publishing his own brochure the following year which highlighted struggles of the church in 1925–1929.\nIn 1937, he attended the World Conference on Church, Community and State in Oxford (the second conference of the Life and Work movement) and delivered a presentation arguing that priests should not get involved in national conflicts.\n\n\n==== Politics ====\n\nIn 1903, Gaigalaitis as a representative of the Lithuanian Conservative Election Societies, was elected to the Prussian House of Representatives of the Landtag of Prussia. He was reelected in 1908 and 1913 serving until 1918. Initially, he joined the fraction of the German Conservative Party but later identified as an independent. According to his memoirs, during his years at the Landtag, he delivered 14 more notable speeches, particularly on the issues of the Lithuanian language in schools and churches. While in Berlin, he promoted Lithuanian culture. For example, he organized an exhibition of Lithuanian folk art in 1910 and lectures about Lithuania.\nDuring World War I, when Germany occupied most of present-day Lithuania, Gaigalaitis published a political brochure The Lithuanian–Baltic Question (Die litauisch-baltische Frage) in which he argued that Germany should create a German-controlled buffer state from the Governorates of Vilna, Kovno, and Suwałki. At the time, he did not want to incorporate Prussian Lithuanians into this polity. In 1917, he published a more comprehensive treatise Lithuania: the Occupied Land (Litauen das besetzte Gebiet) in support of Lithuania's independence. The book included a map of ethnographic Lithuania that encompassed both Lithuania Minor and Lithuania Proper. He was also a member of the German–Lithuanian Society that published newspaper Das neue Litauen which supported Lithuania's independence, but only if Lithuania was dependent on Germany.\nOn 16 November 1918, Gaigalaitis was elected chairman of the National Council of Lithuania Minor which adopted the Act of Tilsit that called for the unification of Lithuania Minor and Lithuania Proper into a single independent Lithuanian state. However, due to political backlash, Gaigalaitis refused to take the post and did not sign the act though he generally was supportive of the idea. Few weeks later, he became chairman of the National Council. Gaigalaitis faced pressure from the German police and fled to Kaunas, the temporary capital of Lithuania, in July 1919. There, he worked as an editor of the government's official newspaper Lietuva.\nHe returned to Klaipėda Region when it was taken over by the French administration as a mandate of the League of Nations in early 1920. He more eagerly joined the Lithuanian efforts of uniting Klaipėda Region with Lithuania, though he wanted to preserve autonomy for the region. On 20 March 1920, Gaigalaitis and three other members of the National Council of Lithuania Minor were coopted by the Council of Lithuania. It was a symbolic measure to show political support for the idea of unification. Gaigalaitis went on two diplomatic missions regarding the Klaipėda Region: for consultations to the United Kingdom in 1921 and as a leader of a delegation of Prussian Lithuanians to the Conference of Ambassadors in November 1922.\nAfter Lithuania gained control of the Klaipėda Region in January 1923, Gaigalaitis became a member of the Directorate of the Klaipėda Region. He was its member from February to December 1923 and primarily worked on religious and educational matters. He drafted the law on the use of the Lithuanian language in schools. Lithuanians wanted to impose stricter Lithuanian language requirements, while Gaigalaitis supported region's autonomy and more moderate approach. Political disagreements led to his resignation from the directorate in December 1923 and withdrawal from further political activities.\nGaigalaitis' political activities attracted criticism. Germans accused him of chauvinism and being a traitor. Lithuanians criticized him for not being sufficiently Lithuanian and for supporting autonomy of the Klaipėda Region. In particular, Gaigalaitis quarreled with Martynas Jankus and Jonas Vanagaitis, two other pro-Lithuanian Prussian Lithuanians.\n\n\n==== Societies ====\nIn 1904, together with others, Gaigalaitis established charitable, cultural, and educational Sandora Society. He was its chairman (until 1940) and editor of its newspaper Pagalba. The society maintained shelters for the disabled, Sunday schools, supported impoverished students, organized church choirs, etc. One of the shelters, established in 1934, now bears his name and continues to operate in Gargždai. The Sandora Society also published 30 books and brochures.\nHe was a member of many other societies, including Birutė Society (supported its library), Lithuanian Literary Society (became its board member by 1911), Lithuanian Scientific Society in Vilnius (1907–1914), and Spauda Society in Tilsit (1914–1922). When the Spauda Society organized the Lithuanian daily Prūsų lietuvių balsas in 1919, Gaigalaitis donated 21,000 marks for the cause.\nIn 1913, in preparation for the 200th birth anniversary of poet Kristijonas Donelaitis, Gaigalaitis published the first biography of Donelaitis and raised money for the construction of his monument on Rambynas. However, the was not built due to World War I. During the war, he raised funds for the Prussians deported to Siberia.\nHe co-founded Aukuras Society to promote Lithuanian culture (1922). In 1924, he was co-founded the Society of the Museum of the Klaipėda Region. He was its chairman until 1939. The society supported the Museum of the Klaipėda Region which opened in 1931 and displayed mainly archaeological artifacts. Gaigalaitis was a representative of the British and Foreign Bible Society in Lithuania (1924–1937). He was also a member and for a time chairman of the Society of Lithuanian–Latvian Unity. Gaigalaitis was one of the leaders of the Klaipėda chapter of the Lithuanian Red Cross established in 1935.\n\n\n==== Education ====\nIn 1922, Gaigalaitis initiated the first Lithuanian gymnasium in Memel (now Klaipėda Vytautas Magnus Gymnasium) and was its first principal (until 1924). He was co-founder and long-term chairman of the Society of Schools in Klaipėda Region established in 1926. When Klaipėda Region was attached to Lithuania, it had 241 primary schools but only one of them taught in Lithuanian. Lack of Lithuanian teachers and resistance from German parents made it difficult to change the language of instruction. Therefore, the society established and maintained private primary schools in the region. In 1938, the society had 60 schools with 2,520 students. In 1934, he established courses for preachers and choirmasters in Klaipėda.\nGaigalaitis and others worked to establish the Faculty of the Evangelical Theology at Vytautas Magnus University in Kaunas. The faculty was established in April 1925. The first three lecturers (including Gaigalaitis) were hired in September 1925. Povilas Jakubėnas (member of the Lithuanian Evangelical Reformed Church) was dean of the faculty, except for the 1927/1928 school year when Gaigalaitis took over the post. Gaigalaitis did not live in Kaunas, and instead commuted from Klaipėda. He worked at the faculty until its closure on 15 September 1936. He taught classes on Christian missions, sociology, liturgy, ethics, exegesis, apologetics, catechesis, and pastoral theology.\n\n\n=== Later life and death ===\nAfter Lithuania lost Klaipėda Region to Nazi Germany in March 1939, Gaigalaitis' life's work was destroyed by the Nazis – various schools and societies (including Sandora Society) were liquidated. He feared arrest by the Gestapo. He moved to Kretinga in January 1940 and worked as a priest of Gargždai parish. His health was failing and he required treatments in sanatoriums.\nIn February 1941, after the Soviet occupation of Lithuania, he expatriated to Germany using his wife's citizenship. They were questioned by the police, passed through a filtration camp, and were prohibited from living with his wife's relatives in Frankfurt. Eventually, they settled in Bretten in present-day Baden-Württemberg. Gaigalaitis lived under police supervision and spent time writing his memoirs (published in 1998). He died there on 30 November 1945. According to his last will, his and his wife's remains were reburied in Elniškė Cemetery near Priekulė on 26 March 1994.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nIn total, Gaigalaitis published 23 books (18 in Lithuanian and five in German). The content of these books varied: academic studies, popular works on Christian morality, educational books on popular science, alphabet books, travel impressions, promotion of teetotalism.\n\n\n=== Academic studies ===\nIn 1904, Gaigalaitis published a study on Gemeinschaftsbewegung (Community Movement) among Prussian Lithuanians. The following year it was translated to Lithuanian as Evangeliški surinkimai Lietuvoje. The movement emerged in the 18th century based on ideas of Pietism and customs of the expelled Salzburg Protestants. According to Gaigalaitis, he spent nine years gathering data and interviewing movement's participants. It remains a valuable historical source and dominates Lithuanian historiography on the subject.\nGaigalaitis had a life-long interest in Lithuanian bibliography. When Silvestras Baltramaitis published his bibliography of Lithuanian books in 1892, Gaigalaitis wrote its review in Varpas and identified 62 missing entries – 58 books and four periodicals. In his personal library, he had 37 of the missing entries. One of these entries (a translation of a short story by Jodocus Temme) is known only from this review. The following year, he published a critical review of historical sources and books on the history of Lithuania in Vienybė lietuvninkų. Starting in 1896, Gaigalaitis compiled bibliography index for journal Mitteilungen der Litauischen literarischen Gesellschaft published by the Lithuanian Literary Society. Such work culminated in a bibliographic review and history of the Lithuanian press Lietuvos nusidavimai ir mūsų rašliava published in 1912. When Lithuania became independent, Gaigalaitis collaborated with Mykolas Biržiška and was one of the key sources for information on Lithuanian books published in Lithuania Minor.\nIn 1913, in preparation for the 200th birth anniversary of priest and poet Kristijonas Donelaitis, Gaigalaitis published his short biography and literary analysis of his key poem The Seasons. It was the first Lithuanian-language work on Donelaitis.\nIn early 1900s, Gaigalaitis studied the works of historian Simonas Daukantas from a linguistic perspective, but this work was not completed.\n\n\n=== Book editor ===\nGaigalaitis edited several books. These include the two-volume Lithuanian translation of Lutheran agenda published in 1897. He edited the Lithuanian translation of the Bible published in 1908. This edition, published in roman and not the German blackletter, was intended for Lithuanians in Lithuania Proper and United States. He modernized the spelling, replaced barbarisms, etc. He also helped edit a collection of Lithuanian folk songs by Vilius Kalvaitis published in 1905. Gaigalaitis also collected folk songs and had a publication prepared in 1888, but it was not published.\n\n\n=== Press articles ===\nThe first known article by Gaigalaitis was published when he was 14. He later contributed to numerous Lithuanian and German periodicals published in Lithuania Minor, Lithuania Proper, and Lithuanians in the United States. Since political articles could attract police attention, Gaigalaitis published under numerous pseudonyms which makes attribution of authorship difficult.\nHe most frequently contributed political articles from his work at the Landtag of Prussia to Lietuviška ceitunga,  Lietuvos keleivis, and Nauja lietuviška ceitunga. He also published political articles in German Rheinisch-Westfälische Zeitung, Der Tag, and others. From 1905 to 1938, Gaigalaitis edited and contributed most of the content to the monthly Pagalba published by the Sandora Society.\n\n\n== Personal library ==\nGaigalaitis was a bibliophile and owned a rich personal library of Lithuanian publications and works about Lithuania in other languages. After World War I, his personal library was merged with the library of the Sandora Society which had about 7,500 books and periodicals in 1939. The library included some old and rare publications, such as Postil of Jonas Bretkūnas (1591), hymnal by Daniel Klein (1704), dictionary by Philipp Ruhig (1747).\nDuring World War II, the library was divided: about 300 books and a collection of periodicals was sold to the State Central Library, other items were taken to Germany, distributed to other collectors, or left to a local priest. Gaigalaitis took about 1,750 volumes with him to Germany. They did not include the old and rare publications (their fate is unknown). In his last will, he left those books to the library of Vytautas Magnus University. In 1956, those volumes were donated to the present-day Berlin State Library. They were catalogued and described by Jochen Dieter Range in 1980. After Lithuania regained independence in 1990, about 1,600 books were transferred to the Martynas Mažvydas National Library of Lithuania in 1997.\nGaigalaitis' personal archive was also dispersed. Some materials were left in Lithuania, others ended up in Germany, Switzerland, United States. Some items were returned from Switzerland with the archive of diplomat Albertas Gerutis. In 2022, relatives of Gaigalaitis transferred some of his personal archive to the Ieva Simonaitytė Public Library of Klaipėda County. The documents include manuscripts of memoirs, diaries, letters, photographs, a few personal effects.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nGaigalaitis received the following awards:\n\n1928: Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas (3rd degree)\n1928: Independence Medal (Lithuania)\n1930: Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas (2nd degree)\n1933: Honorary Doctorate in Theology by the University of Latvia\n1935: Order of the Three Stars (4th degree)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGaigalaitis' bibliography",

        "content": "Kelebantse Sebele II (1892 – 2 October 1939) was kgosi of the Kwena tribe in the Bechuanaland Protectorate (present-day Botswana). He succeeded his father, Sechele II, in 1918. Sebele quickly came into conflict with other members of his family and with the British colonial administration, which deemed him uncooperative and unstable. He held onto power by resisting advisors and taking a harsh approach to ruling, while he collaborated with other dikgosi to protest increasing British control over the protectorate.\nSebele was exiled by the colonial administration in 1931, in an effort led by the new resident commissioner Charles Rey. The administration accused Sebele of corruption and oppression of his people. Sebele's removal incited anger among the Bakwena, who continued to recognise him as the legitimate kgosi. He was succeeded by his younger brother Kgari Sechele II, who was chosen by Rey despite not being next in the line of succession. Sebele's son Moruakgomo Sechele became a pretender, triggering a succession crisis in 1962.\n\n\n== Early life and family ==\nKelebantse Sebele was born in 1892 as the son of Sechele II, kgosi of the Kwena tribe. He was the younger brother of Padi and the elder brother of Tumagole, Kgari, Kgwanyakgwanyang, and Neale. Sebele attended the Tiger Kloof Educational Institute for one year. He moved to Witwatersrand in 1912, where he worked as a mining clerk until 1916. The following year, he enlisted in the South African Native Labour Corps and fought in France during World War I. Sebele took Tlhalefang as his senior wife.\n\n\n== Kgosi of the Bakwena ==\nSebele became kgosi of the Bakwena on 12 February 1918. While the British colonial administration faced several dikgosi that they found insufficient, Sebele proved to be their greatest concern. Britain's resident commissioner expressed concern about Sebele's succession, describing him as unstable and alcoholic to the high commissioner and requesting that his formal confirmation as kgosi be postponed. The confirmation was delayed indefinitely and still had not taken place by the time his tenure ended. Sebele was the first kgosi of the Kwena tribe who could read English.\nUpon becoming kgosi, Sebele inherited the opposition that had plagued his father. Sebele's uncles, Kebohula and Moiteelasilo, had split with the tribe and remained at Borakalalo when Sechele had moved the tribe's capital to the neighbouring Ntsweng. Sebele developed a reputation among his opponents for being irresponsible as kgosi, and he was also seen as unduly harsh, earning him the nickname kgoma ya tlhaba (transl. wild ox). He resisted his advisors and councillors, wishing to avoid any delegation or curtailing of his powers.\nThe greatest point of contention under Sebele's reign was religion. The London Missionary Society, which held influence over many Bakwena headmen, objected to several practices that were permitted by the Kwena tribe. Sebele's father had already allowed Anglicanism to be practiced by the Bakwena and reversed the tribe's rules against polygyny, rainmaking, and bogwera. Sebele angered the London Missionary Society further by allowing circumcision. Sebele's opponents lambasted him as a reactionary and a neotraditionalist. The headmen also had personal reasons for opposing Sechele and Sebele, who had allowed the promotions of junior tribal headmen and even commoners as advisors over senior headmen. This in itself was a response to the London Missionary Society's hold over the senior headmen. During a period in 1925, Sebele temporarily stepped away from his duties, and Kebohula served as acting kgosi. The colonial administration found Kebohula to be more responsible and more cooperative. A dispute between the two occurred in 1927 when Sebele accused Kebohula of witchcraft. Three days of deliberation ended with a decision to banish Kebohula from the tribe, but the colonial administration overruled the decision. It then passed a proclamation banning both attempts to use witchcraft and making accusations of witchcraft.\nSebele's ascension marked the beginning of reduced trade between the Bakwena and the peoples of the Kalahari Desert, and the colonial administration blamed Sebele for their reduced influence in the region over the following years. Contact was lost entirely with the village Tsetseng. It was not restored until 1940, when the colonial administration declared that it had rediscovered the village and re-incorporated it. Sebele resented the control that the British Empire exercised over the tribe. He was one of the dikgosi involved with efforts to limit British power over the protectorate in 1927 along with Tshekedi Khama, and the colonial administration feared that they were gaining influence over other dikgosi, Bathoen II and Molefi.\nInfrastructure was a major focus for Sebele during his reign. He set standardised building requirements, had landfills installed, ordered the use of graveyards, and oversaw the creation of roads and a British hospital. He was an advocate for community events, and he sometimes attended events to sing and play the piano. Sebele took a second wife, a Coloured woman named Susan Wolf, whom he married in 1928. He took a third fiancee, Senwelo-a-Jacoba, but they never wed. The colonial administration was unsatisfied with his oversight of the hut tax, feeling that he was not doing enough to enforce its payment. The administration assumed responsibility for its collection in 1929. Sebele also angered the colonial administration whe he resisted its efforts to exempt Europeans from tribal law.\n\n\n== Removal ==\nThe colonial administration began planning the removal of Sebele as early as 1921, but chose to wait until enough of the population would support such action, as he remained popular among commoners. Sebele's advisors—many of whom were his uncles and cousins—filed complaints against him to the administration, but they remained a minority at the time. Such complaints were filed in numerous times throughout the 1920s, but each time it was determined that his popularity among commoners prevented removal. Charles Rey became resident commissioner in 1930 and decided that he would have Sebele removed. Rey complained that Sebele was corrupt, refusing to preside over disputes or settling them based on favouritism and bribery. He described Sebele as \"a drunken dissolute ruffian\" and said that he expected he would \"have to depose him before long\". The local magistrate Howard Neale advised Rey that the native peoples were fatalists and would accept any change in leadership imposed by the administration. This later proved incorrect.\nRey received authorisation from the high commissioner to depose Sebele in October 1930, but this was overruled by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs that December. Rey found a pretext to remove Sebele in March 1931, when he had the tribe commence the traditional bogwera initiation ceremony. This rite of passage was considered anti-Christian, and its practice was seen as a direct rejection of the administration's authority. Rey's description of the events, which he had exaggerated to suggest participation was coerced, convinced the dominion affairs secretary to allow for Sebele's removal. The order to remove Sebele was given on 7 May 1931.\nThe administration chose to remove Sebele from the area before deposing him to avoid a risk of revolt by the Bakwena. Sebele, Kebohula, and Moiteelasilo were summoned to Mafeking, ostensibly to discuss regional water policy. They arrived on 2 June 1931, at which point Sebele was informed that he was to be banished to Ghanzi, while Kebohula and Moiteelasilo would serve on an interim council. Sebele was not afforded a trial and complained that he had not received the due process he was entitled to under the colonial law. The official reasons given for his removal were \"the embezzlement of £200 hut tax; his oppression and misrule of Bakwena; corruption in kgotla cases; seduction of the daughter of Corporal Moses; the assault of his principal wife Tlhalefang; and neglect of his duties\". Sebele left in exile on 10 June. Before leaving, he reportedly sent a message to his people reading \"Retlasetswe\", meaning that the tribe has been attacked or invaded. This later became a common refrain in demanding his return. Rey hoped that the removal would make an example of Sebele and discourage resistance from other dikgosi. In effect, it emboldened their resistance.\nThe Bakwena were outraged by Sebele's removal. Upon returning to Ntsweng, Kebohula, Moiteelasilo, and their police escort were pelted with stones. Rey organised a meeting of two thousand Bakwena in Molepolole on 10 June where Sebele's successor was appointed. No one here was allowed to speak Sebele's name. Rey decided to skip the line of succession and appointed Sebele's younger brother Kgari as acting kgosi. The people are said to have stood or raised their hands upon Kgari's appointment, which Rey argued was an indication of their support. The meeting was interrupted only once, by a man who earned cheers from the crowd when demanding Sebele's return.\n\n\n== Exile and succession ==\n\nTribes in Bechuanaland and South Africa expressed their support for Sebele, demanding his return and raising legal funds. Sebele reportedly contacted several dikgosi to seek their assistance. The colonial administration's official position was that it had not initiated Sebele's removal and that its only involvement was to facilitate support of an internal uprising. The colonial administration was careful when describing the events not to use the word \"deposed\", instead saying that Sebele was \"relieved of his functions\". Historian Jeff Ramsay described Sebele's reign and subsequent removal as the point that the Kwena tribe began declining in influence.\nSebele was still considered the rightful chief by the Bakwena while he was in exile, and many continued to demand his return. As resistance continued, Rey organised a ceremony to coronate Kgari as the official kgosi on 1 September 1931, hoping to legitimise his rule. Complicating the succession was that Sebele had never been formally removed from the position, only exiled.  Sebele's supporters, the BoSebele, submitted the Great Petition to the colonial administration on 6 March 1933, demanding Sebele be returned and that his right to due process be recognised. The petition had approximately 1,400 signatories, in contrast to the previous petitions that had been submitted against his rule, which had never accumulated more than 25 signatures. Bathoen II and Tshekedi also managed to have the issue brought before the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. Over time, the BoSebele began facing fines, unemployment, and arrest.\nSebele was popular among the people in Ghanzi, to the point that white residents feared his influence. He believed that he had not truly been banished, because he was still in the country, while the British were not. Sebele had his first son, Moruakgomo Sechele, in 1934 with his wife Susan. He later had a second son, Mokgalagadi, also with Susan. Kgari privately acknowledged that Sebele was the legitimate chief and resisted efforts to bring about his return, rejecting an offer by Sebele to formally abdicate in exchange for an end to his exile in 1938.\nSebele died on 2 October 1939, and his body was returned to Molepolole. Sebele's removal fostered doubt about the Bakwena line of succession that continued for generations after his death. His death added legitimacy to Kgari's rule, but Moruakgomo remained a pretender. Supporters of Bonewamang Padi Sechele, another pretender, insisted that Susan never formally wed Sebele, which would make Moruakgomo illegitimate. Moruakgomo and Bonewamang were the subjects of a succession dispute after Kgari's death in 1962, which led to Sebele's brother Neale being chosen as kgosi.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nGulbrandsen, Ørnulf (2012).

        "content": "The Soft Pack is the debut full-length studio album by American California-based indie rock band The Soft Pack. It was released on February 2, 2010, through Kemado Records in the United States and Heavenly Recordings worldwide. Recording sessions took place at Saltlands Studio in Brooklyn in August 2009, except for the song \"Parasites\", which was recorded at Manny Nieto Estudio in July 2008. Production was handled by Eli Janney, except for the song \"Parasites\", which was produced by Rob Barbato. The album debuted at number 27 on the US Heatseekers Albums chart.\nThe album spawned four singles: \"Parasites\", \"Answer to Yourself\", \"C'mon\" and \"More or Less\". Its second single, \"Answer to Yourself\", which peaked at No. 51 on the UK Physical Singles Chart and No. 14 on the Mexico Ingles Airplay chart, became the final song streamed on WOXY.com before its sudden shutdown on March 23, 2010. It is also used for the commercial of the Dutch beer brand Grolsch since August 2010 and was included in the 2013 video game Grand Theft Auto V on the in-game radio station Vinewood Boulevard Radio. The album's third single, \"C'mon\", reached No. 26 on the UK Physical Singles Chart and No. 10 on the Mexico Ingles Airplay. The fourth and final single off of the album, \"More or Less\", made it to No. 44 on the UK Physical Singles Chart.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe Soft Pack was met with generally favourable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 74, based on twenty-one reviews. The aggregator AnyDecentMusic? has the critical consensus of the album at a 6.6 out of 10, based on eighteen reviews.\nDoug Freeman of The Austin Chronicle wrote: \"for all the influences that rip through the LP, the youthful abandon recasts them for a new generation\". Jason Heller of The A.V. Club wrote: \"granted, The Soft Pack has knife-edged pop riffs and crooned vocals galore. But a closer probe reveals a knack for punky songcraft and caffeinated oomph that could have easily been inherited from fellow San Diego group Hot Snakes\". AllMusic's Heather Phares wrote: \"The Soft Pack allows this band an almost completely clean break with their past while showing they're dynamic no matter what they're called\". Andrzej Lukowski of Drowned in Sound wrote: \"it's done brilliantly, with no frills, no ego, no sense of homage (just some damn fine influences), no fat, no bullshit, nothing bar hooks, energy and a certain air of ineffable sadness for good measure. Sometimes you need to believe a scene or movement will save your life. Other times, there's nothing wrong being casually blown away by a record like The Soft Pack\". Saxon Baird of PopMatters found it \"never sound cliche, but excitingly new, even if their influences can be clearly identified\". Stuart Berman of Pitchfork wrote: \"though Lamkin's monotone voice is not the most expressive instrument--it barely wavers whether the occasion calls for a Monks-style organ vamp (\"Move Along\") or a prom-night embrace (\"Mexico\")--each album side gradually ratchets up the tension and releases it through a raucous rave-up (\"Pull Out\" on side A, \"Parasites\" on side B) that successfully bridges the Soft Pack's Nuggets-schooled ethos with the modern-day discord of San Diegan patron saints Hot Snakes\".\nIn mixed reviews, Laura Snapes of NME wrote: \"they may be strutting right down the middle of the road, but they look pretty damn cool doing it. The Soft Pack make being A-OK into something to be proud of\". Will Dean of The Guardian wrote: \"that it's derivative isn't that much of a stick to beat them with, though--they've produced 30 minutes of glossy, singalong, preppy pop-punk\". Michael Cragg of musicOMH resumed: \"it's not a bad album, it's not a good album, it's merely an alright album and that's the real problem\". Mikael Wood of The Boston Phoenix concluded: \"nothing about The Soft Pack makes you wanna know who these guys are or what they have to say about the world outside their practice space\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nMatt Lamkin – songwriter, vocals, guitar, artwork\nMatty McLoughlin – songwriter, guitar\nDave Lantzman – songwriter, backing vocals, bass\nBrian Hill – songwriter, backing vocals, drums\nEli Janney – producer & mixing (tracks: 1–9)\nRob Barbato – producer (track 10)\nManny Nieto – engineering (track 10)\nAaron Rutledge – engineering assistant (tracks: 1–9)\nJoe Lambert – mastering\nShay Peretz – photography\nBrett Erickson – layout\nJean Coffey – management\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Soft Pack at Discogs (list of releases)",

        "content": "Strapped is the second full-length studio album by American indie rock band The Soft Pack. It was released on September 25, 2012, through Mexican Summer. Recording sessions took place at Kingsize Soundlabs, Comp-ny and Rollercoaster Recording in California. Production was handled by the Soft Pack themselves, except for the song \"Bobby Brown\", which was co-produced by Rob Barbato. The album debuted at number 27 on the US Heatseekers Albums chart.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nStrapped was met with generally favourable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 69, based on twenty reviews. The aggregator AnyDecentMusic? has the critical consensus of the album at a 6.8 out of 10, based on sixteen reviews.\nMartyn Young of DIY called the album \"a significant step forward from their debut; far more expansive and ambitious\". Thomas Hannan of The Line of Best Fit wrote: \"as with each of their records, it follows the pattern of having two numbers which will be your absolute favourites, despite the rest of it still ranging from passable to very good\". AllMusic's Heather Phares found it \"isn't a bad album so much as a strangely scattered one, revealing the Soft Pack caught between delivering what they're known for and what they might like to become\". Brendan Frank of Beats Per Minute wrote: \"The Soft Pack's knack for a no-tassels hook is what ends up making Strapped worthwhile, and it works best when they tighten the screws and keep it concise\". Chris Coplan of Consequence stated: \"they may still be a work in progress, but that progress thus far is demonstrative of an increasingly innovative band, one working too hard to slump\". Jamie Fullerton of NME wrote: \"uncomplicated, Spinto Band-ish jangles like 'Second Look', 'Tallboy' and 'Everything I Know' plough casually and happily along without a care in the world, very much like the band themselves\". Rachel Bailey of Paste concluded that the album \"isn't groundbreaking, especially by the standards The Soft Pack have set for themselves\". Aaron Leitko of Pitchfork resumed: \"long and lush isn't a bad look for the Soft Pack, so long as they're keeping the beat\".\nIn mixed reviews, Andy Baber of musicOMH stated: \"it is a straightforward and solid return from a band who sound unsure whether to stick or twist\". Matthew Fiander of PopMatters called it \"an album that seems to both highlight the Soft Pack's strengths and glaringly reveal their limitations to this point\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nMatt Lamkin – vocals, guitar, keyboards, recording (track 11), artwork\nMatty McLoughlin – guitar\nDave Lantzman – guitar, keyboards, bass, photography\nBrian Hill – drums, percussion, photography\nAaron Hestor – saxophone (track 2)\nTony Bevilacqua – saxophone (tracks: 5, 8–10, 12)\nWill Canzoneri – keyboards (tracks: 7, 8, 12)\nRob Barbato – co-producer & recording (track 5)\nDrew Fischer – recording (tracks: 1–3, 6–10, 12), mixing (track 8)\nDavid Newton – recording (track 4)\nLars Stalfors – mixing (tracks: 1–7, 9–12)\nPete Lyman – mastering\nArlette Kotchounian – photography\nClaire Acosta – photography\nHawley Wright – artwork\nAndrew Miller – layout\nRob Carmichael – layout assistant\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Soft Pack – Strapped at Discogs (list of releases)",

        "content": "Lalrinzuala Lalbiaknia (born 15 September 2000), commonly known by the nickname Rinzuala, is an Indian professional footballer who plays as a striker for Aizawl in the I-League.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== Youth career ===\nRinzuala played in the Subroto Cup, before being scouted by Bengaluru FC, which he represented at the U-16 and U-18 levels. He suffered an ACL injury in 2018, that kept him away of the game for 11 months.\nSubsequently, he played three seasons for Gokulam Kerala reserves before returning home in 2022 to play for Chhinga Veng, that competed in the Mizoram Premier League. He recalled that it \"was a decision that I felt I had to take\" and that he \"needed to come back home and start afresh\".\n\n\n=== Aizawl ===\n\n\n==== 2023–24 season ====\nOn 13 June 2023, I-League club Aizawl secured the services of Rinzuala, on a two-year deal. On 29 October, he made his debut for the club in the 2023–24 I-League campaign against Mohammedan SC, in a 2-1 away loss. On 14 November, Rinzuala scored three goals in a 1–3 win over NEROCA, which was his first professional hat-trick. On 28 March, Rinzuala netted twice in a 4–0 win over Churchill Brothers. In this process, he broke the record for most goals scored by an Indian footballer in a single season of the I-League, with 14 goals, overtaking Sunil Chhetri and Mohammed Rafi.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nRinzuala  was born in the streets of Serchhip, a town in his home state of Mizoram. His father, who was a driver, passed away in 2016, before his elder brother died in an accident the following year. His mother started a chicken farm after that, which sustained his family since.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n=== Club ===\nAs of 5 April 2024\n\n\n== Honours ==\nDelhi FC\n\nI-League 2nd Division: 2022–23Individual\n\nMost goals scored by an Indian in a I-League season – 15 goals\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLalrinzuala Lalbiaknia at Soccerway\nLalrinzuala Lalbiaknia profile at AIFF",

        "earliest_creation_date": "2005-02-19 05:00:58",
        "content": "Mjörn is a lake in Västergötland, shared between the municipalities of Alingsås and Lerum and is part of the main catchment area of the Göta River. The lake is 48 meters deep, covers an area of 54.5 square kilometers and has an elevation of 57.1 meters above sea level.\n\n\n== About the lake ==\nMjörn is 55 km2 in size and has a maximum depth of 48 meters. It is 16 km long and 7 km wide. This makes it the second largest lake in Västergötland that lies entirely within the landscape (after Unden). The lake is 58 m above sea level. There are around 60 named islands in Mjörn. Alingsås and Västra Bodarna lie on the lake's eastern shore and Sjövik and Björboholm on the western shore. The lake is not fully regulated, so the water level can vary quite considerably. Its ice and winds are also quite unpredictable. Mjörn is drained by Säveån.\nIts tributaries include Lake Anten and Lake Ålandasjön in the north and Säveån through Alingsås. Its outflow is mainly in Solveden as well as the power plant in Norsesund. It then continues in the lake Sävelången, Säveån through Lerum and Partille municipalities and into the Göta River in Gothenburg.\nThere are several valuable biological, geological and cultural-historical areas around Mjörn.\n\n\n== Fishes ==\nEighteen different species have been identified so far. Among these are more unusual species such as alpine bullhead, lamprey and the special Mjörn trout. The others are northern pike, perch, zander, eel, bream, roach, ide, tench, burbot, ninespine stickleblack, ruffe, vendace and smelt. A local rumor in the Alingså area claims that the lake also hosts the wels catfish, but this has never been confirmed.A fishing license is required. In test fishing, perch, bream, northern pike, perch, zander, burbot, roach, ruffe, vendace and tench have been caught in the lake.\n\n\n== Bird life ==\nMjörn also offers a rich bird life. There are purely maritime species here that do not normally belong in an inland environment, such as great black-backed gull, eurasian oystercatcher and common eider. During migration times, countless birds pass over Mjörn. Examples of breeding seabirds are the black-throated loon, osprey, little ringed plover, red-breasted merganser and great black-backed gull. Bird reserves have been established in Mjörn.\n\n\n== Islands in Mjörn ==\nAll the islands in Mjörn are areas with high nature values. Several small islands are bird protection areas. As late as the 1950s, agriculture was practiced on four of the lake's largest islands. There are now two permanent homes, one on Bokö and one on Kärleken.\n\n\n== Shipping ==\nIn 1987, the non-profit association \"Mjörns Sjökortsförening\" was formed with the aim of creating reliable nautical charts of Mjörn and to manage the marking of a fairway across the lake. Since then, the association has built five new lighthouses on the lake, in addition to the existing \"Alingsås angöring\" lighthouse, and published seven editions of nautical charts.\n\n\n== Sub-catchment area ==\nMjörn is part of the sub-basin (642512-129848) that SMHI calls the outlet of Mjörn. The average height is 81 meters above sea level and the area is 155.69 square kilometers. If the 46 upstream catchment areas are included, the accumulated area is 1.115.33 square kilometers. The Säveån river that drains the catchment area has tributary order 2, which means that the water flows through a total of 2 watercourses before reaching the sea after 46 kilometers. The catchment area consists mostly of forest (41%). It also has 55.73 square kilometers of water surface, giving it a lake percentage of 35.8%. Settlements in the area cover an area of 8.65 square kilometers or 6% of the catchment area.\n\n\n== Areas of application ==\nMjörn is popular as a swimming, boating and fishing lake. Alingsås Segelsällskap, Sjöscoutkår and Mjörns Motorbåtsällskap are based on the lake. Mjörns Ångbåtsförening operates the steam tug S/S Herbert, built in 1905. Recreational fishing is controlled by Alingsås Sportfiskeförening. The Mjörn Runt cycle race is organized annually, starting and finishing in Alingsås. Other associations with links to Mjörn include Föreningen Mjörn, Hjällnäs Båt- och Bryggförening, Mjörns Fiskevårdsområdesförening, Föreningen Mjörnbygden and Björboholms Segelsällskap.\nThe attractiveness of the environment around the lake is shown by the increased demand for plots and large house constructions in Alingsås. The attraction is the \"magnificent view of Lake Mjörn\". Also worth mentioning are the old historic large farms of Bryngenäs, Öijared, Östad and Vikaryd.\nIn connection with the advent of the railroad, typical summer homes were built. The villages of Björboholm, Västra Bodarne and Skår, Lövekulle with its large holiday villas, owned by wealthy merchants mostly from Gothenburg, developed alongside both the Western Main Line, whose first sod was turned in Lövekulle outside Alingsås, and the West Gothenburg Line. Several of them still exist along the shores of Lake Mjörn.\n\n\n== The name ==\nThe lake's oldest name is Mior, and it is already mentioned in Västgötalagen (1350) as a public lake. According to the county administrative board, Mjörn has also been classified as a lake with \"particularly high nature value\", meaning the highest possible classification.\n\n\n== History of the lake ==\nThere are many ancient remains around the lake and on the islands, and ancient finds have been found on the shores and islands. Several excavations have been made on Risön and objects from the Stone Age (3000-1800 BC) have been found.\nAt the Brobacka Nature Center on the northern shore of Mjörn, Scandinavia's largest giant's kettle field can be found, with the largest one measuring approximately 18 meters in diameter. It serves as a reminder of the time when the inland ice covered the area. The powerful flow of meltwater through the narrow passage in Brobacka carried large stones, shaping the enormous kettles.\nMjörn was once part of the North Sea and remnants from this period can still be found today, including so-called glacial marine relics, caridean shrimp that have adapted to fresh water and seashells from sea snails.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nSMHI: Sjöar, vattendrag och avrinningsområden (in Swedish).\n\"Ladda ner data från Svenskt vattenarkiv – Ackumulerade delavrinningsområden (SVAR 2010)\" (Esri Shape).

        "content": "Marooned is the 9th episode of The Ren & Stimpy Show of the first season of The Ren & Stimpy Show that originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on 6 October 1991. It is the second episode in a loosely linked trilogy known as the \"space episodes\" set in the show-within-the show, The Adventures of Commander Hòek and Cadet Stimpy.  \n\n\n== Plot ==\nNotwithstanding their deaths in Space Madness, the episode continues with the story of The Adventures of Commander Hòek and Cadet Stimpy that casts Ren and Stimpy as astronauts going farther into space than any other dog and cat before. The duo clash their space ship onto a strange plant and find themselves marooned. When Ren complains \"we're marooned!\", Stimpy tells him \"just like the title of this cartoon!\" Ren and Stimpy constantly fight as Ren is annoyed by Stimpy's stupidity and habit of making annoying sounds. Stimpy has a handbook for survival, but the duo are nearly eaten several times by hostile aliens. Ren sees an apparition of a female dog that is merely a trick by an alien to lure him out of his camp. Finally, the duo are shallowed alive by an alien and are confronted by the microorganisms living within the alien's stomach. Stimpy tells Ren that his survival book reads: \"It says-we're doomed!\" The ending of the episode implies that Ren and Stimpy will be eaten alive.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe idea for the trilogy known as the \"space episodes\" that would serve as both a parody of Star Trek and as a show-within-the-show was created during a writing session held during a drinking bout in a bar between John Kricfalusi and Jim Smith. The storyboard for the episode was done by Chris Reccardi. Kent Butterworth, an animator who worked for Ralph Bakshi was alleged to have worked as an uncredited free-lancer on the episode and was blamed for the episode's slow pacing, but he denies he ever worked on Marooned. Marooned was finished late and aired months after the date selected for its première.     \n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of John Kricfalusi\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nSexy chihuahua-voice of Cheryl Chase\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe critic Jonathan Barkan praised Space Madness along with its sequel Marooned that \"played almost like demented Star Trek episodes.\" The American critic Dawn Taylor rated Marooned as one of the best episodes of the first season that featured \"some truly disturbing Galapagos Island nature footage.\" By contrast, the American critic Thad Komorowski rated Marooned as a bomb as he stated the episode was slowly paced and boring. \n\n\n== Books and articles ==\nDobbs, G.

The Allied forces managed to capture the city after a long siege.\n\n\n== Siege ==\nThe Arabs began transferring their military operations to the far east of the island of Sicily and set out to besiege the city of Messina. The Aghlabids were allied with the Neapolitans and besieged the city from land and sea. The Aghlabids were led by Fadl bin Jafar al-Hamadhani. The city fiercely resisted the Arabs, repelling all of their assaults. Al-Fadl made a plan; he secretly sent part of his force to the mountains behind the city of Messina. Al-Fadl then launched a vigorous assault from the sea. While the Byzantine garrison concentrated on repelling the assaults, the Aghlabid force marched down from the mountains and scaled the walls behind the Byzantines. Seeing this, the Byzantine garrison soon capitulated, and Messina was taken. The siege lasted from October 10, 842, to September 29, 843.\nThe victory at Messina allowed the Aghlabids to control the crucial strait of Messina, and there the Aghlabids launched their raids into southern Italy.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nAlexander A.

        "content": "Impact events have been a recurring theme in fiction since the 1800s.\n\n\n== History ==\nImpact events have been a recurring theme in fiction since the 1800s. The earliest such stories tended to depict impacts by comets, though other objects such as asteroids and meteoroids became more common in the 1900s. Impact events from more massive celestial objects also appear on occasion. The theme increased in popularity from the 1950s onward, possibly as a result of nuclear anxiety following World War II, and received additional boosts in popularity in 1980 with the publication of the Alvarez hypothesis, which states that the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago was caused by an asteroid impact that created the Chicxulub crater off the coast of Mexico, and in 1994 with the collision of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter.: 79–82 \n\n\n== Disaster ==\nImpact events are a common disaster scenario in fiction.\n\n\n== Tunguska event ==\n\nThe 1908 Tunguska event—an enormous explosion in a remote region of Siberia—has appeared in many works of fiction. It is generally held to have been caused by a meteor air burst, though several alternative explanations have been proposed both in scientific circles and in fiction. A popular one in fiction is that it was caused by an alien spaceship, possibly first put forth in Ed Earl Repp's 1930 short story \"The Second Missile\". It gained prominence following the publication of Russian science fiction writer Alexander Kazantsev's 1946 short story \"Explosion\"; inspired by the similarities between the event and the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima, Kazantsev's story posits that a nuclear explosion in the engine of a spacecraft was responsible. An alien spacecraft is also the explanation in Polish science fiction writer Stanisław Lem's 1951 novel The Astronauts and its 1960 film adaptation The Silent Star, while a human-made one is to blame in Ian Watson's 1983 novel Chekhov's Journey. Additional variations on the spaceship theme appear in Donald R. Bensen's 1978 novel And Having Writ... and Algis Budrys's 1993 novel Hard Landing, among others. Another proposed explanation is that the cause was the impact of a micro black hole, as in Larry Niven's 1975 short story \"The Borderland of Sol\". Some stories nevertheless accept the conventional meteorite explanation, such as the 1996 The X-Files episode \"Tunguska\" that instead revolves around the impact possibly having introduced alien microbial life to Earth.\n\n\n== See also ==\nApocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction\nAsteroids in fiction\nComets in fiction\nDisasters in popular culture\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBloom, Steven D.

        "content": "Larry Tamblyn (born Lawrence Arnold Tamblyn, February 5, 1943) is an American musician and a The Standells member since the 1960s.\n\n\n== Career ==\nTamblyn released his first set of singles as a solo artist between the late 1950s and early 1960s. He formed The Standells in 1962, and came up with the idea of the band name from them \"standing\" around booking agents' offices trying to get work. Their first single \"You'll Be Mine Someday/In My Heart\" was released in 1964. Their drummer during this time was Gary Leeds, later of The Walker Brothers. When he left, he was replaced by former Mouseketeer Dick Dodd.\nThe Standells biggest song was \"Dirty Water\" in 1965. The song written by Ed Cobb. Though the song is credited solely to Cobb, band members Dodd, Valentino and Tamblyn have claimed substantial material-of-fact song composition copyright contributions to it as well as contributing to its arrangement. Tamblyn has stated that Cobb's version was a \"standard blues song\", adding: \"We took the song with the condition that we could arrange in any way we want; we added the guitar riff into it and all of the wonderful vocal asides like, 'I'm gonna tell you a story, It's all about my town, I'm going to tell you a big fat story'...that was all written by us.\"\nThe Standells has reformed many times over the years, most of them including Tamblyn and Tony Valentino. The current version of the Standells is led by Tamblyn.\nTamblyn was inducted into the California Music Hall of Fame in 2023.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nLarry Tamblyn was born in Los Angeles to actors Sally Aileen (née Triplett) and Eddie Tamblyn. His older brother is actor Russ Tamblyn. Before working in music professionally, Larry worked as a fry cook, dish washer, hot dog vendor, and packager at a store. His niece is actor Amber Tamblyn, who is married to actor and comedian David Cross.\n\n\n== Equipment ==\nTamblyn used a Vox Continental electric organ during the \"Dirty Water\" days. Currently, he uses Yamaha Motif XS6 and Hammond organ.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Titovskaya Sopka is a mountain massif (max. elevation 944.7 m), valuable natural-historical territory, complex geological natural monument of local significance (paleontological, petrographic and geomorphological types according to the scientific classification of geological heritage objects). It is located on the southwestern outskirts of Chita, near the confluence of the Ingoda and Chitinka Rivers.\n\n\n== Geographical description ==\nTitovskaya Sopka is a Permian-Early Triassic stratovolcano of the Ingodin-Chita volcanic field. Titovskaya Sopka is characterized by explosive type of volcanic eruption, lavas of medium basic composition, flows of trachyte, trachyandesite, basalt, predominance of clastolavas of plugs with volcanic bombs, complete absence of slag and a large amount of loose tufa material.\nThe stratovolcano is mainly composed of trachyte, trachylliolite, trachyandesite flows, trachyte clastoflavas (up to 100 m wide flows) with rare horizons of basalts (up to 20 m wide flows) attributed to the Tamir series. In the southern rocky parts of Titov Sopka, clastoflavas with volcanic bombs up to 2 m in diameter predominate. Trachyriolite flows with vertical fluidity emphasizing lava movement in the volcano's feeding channel (over 50 m wide) have been established. There, among lava flows of black basalts (1.8 to 30 m wide), a pegmatite dike (7 m wide) and a body of syenite porphyry (18 m wide) that healed the volcano's parasitic plug are also noted. The eastern slopes consist of flows of trachybasalts and trachytes interlayered with clastoplavas and vitrocrystalline tuffs. The width of the flows is 5–10 m. On the left side of the Logovoy dip, the quarry is covered by trachybasalts with a plug made of syenite porphyries (width over 50 m). The peculiarity of the syenite porphyries is the mass development of various \"fernlike\" bushy dendrites of manganese and iron oxides, 20–30 cm in size, along the fractures, as well as many cracks, micro-fractures with displacement amplitude up to 20 cm. On the northern spurs of Titovskaya Sopka, horizons of yellow-gray massive tuffs with secondary bluish formations of vivianite type were found among trachyte clasts.Opposite the lookout point along the Moskovskiy Tract, another parasitic plug is exposed in the road quarry, healed by syenite porphyries.\nIn the southwestern part of the massif, along the steep escarpment above the rocky tributary of the Ingoda River, there is a contact — superposition of trachyte lavas on Paleozoic leucocratic granites. On the southern rocks there is an area of about 50 m high preserved basement terrace of the Praingoda with weak alluvium. The Ingoda River valley in the area of the southern slopes belongs to the antecedent type.\n\n\n== Paleontological findings ==\nIn 1960-1963 M. P. Bezverkhny and M. B. Zvonkova found in sandy loam sediments on the northern outskirts of Titov Sopka the remains of mammoth tusks, a woolly rhinoceros elbow bone, and horse skeletal fragments dated to the Middle-Late Pleistocene. In 1967 E. I. Kornutova found a bison tooth in the area of the mill. In 1991 a student of the Mining Faculty of Transbaikal State University I. V. Kotelnikov found a bison tooth to the north of the mill. V. Kotelnikov collected numerous horse teeth on the northwestern outskirts of Titov Sopka. Paleontological findings of vertebrates are completely selected. Therefore, the paleontological monument Titovskaya Sopka belongs to the category of destroyed monuments and is included in the Geological Red Book of Transbaikalia.\n\n\n== Archaeology ==\n\nA. K. Kuznetsov, the director of the CHOCM, A. I. Makhalov, an employee of the museum, and E. I. Titov, an ethnologist and teacher, made the first collections of stone tools on Titovskaya Sopka. In 1950, A. P. Okladnikov collected ancient artifacts on the territory of the psychoneurological hospital. In 1952, he discovered and excavated a Stone Age workshop, which revealed a picture of harvesting and initial processing of stone raw materials. According to the definition of V. F. Petrun, the main type of raw material was microlavobreccia.\nSince 1966, I. I. Kirillov has been studying the ancient settlements of Sukhotino. The most interesting is Sukhotino-4, where a number of culture remains with Upper Paleolithic dwellings were discovered in the sediments of the Sartanian glaciation. The inhabitants of the dwellings used stone, bone and liner tools. They hunted mammoth, rhinoceros, red and reindeer, bison, saiga, gazelle, blackbucks and others. They also found the shells of Asian ostrich eggs.\nOn the slopes of Titovskaya Sopka four sites with ancient rock paintings are known. The first two were discovered in the 1950s by A. P. Okladnikov, they are Titovskaya Sopka and Sokhatiny Kamen. Other monuments with ancient art are Sukhotino 13 and Gorge, burials from the Bronze Age to the Middle Ages are also known. Gold and silver objects were found in some of the burials. On the south-western slope of the mountain the Russian settlement Zasoposhnoye, inhabited in the late XVII - 1st half of the XIX century, was studied. According to P. S. Pallas, the inhabitants of the settlement built rafts for rafting on the Ingoda, Shilka and Amur rivers. There are remains of log houses, blacksmith's and potter's workshops in the settlement. Later, due to the erosion of the slopes, the settlement was moved to the neighboring Zasopka village.\nThe archaeological monuments of Titovskaya Sopka are constantly subjected to negligence on the part of local authorities, commercial enterprises and the population. Volunteers, scientists and students have been fighting for the preservation of unique archaeological and natural monuments for over 30 years.\nSince the middle of May 2023 work has been started on the definition of a specially protected natural area, which should allow the creation of a tourist zone on the territory of Titovskaya Sopka. It is planned to create an ethno-archaeological park on the territory of the Sukhotino monument complex. For this purpose Sukhotino-4 will be cleared for the museumization of the Paleolithic residential complex. In addition, an ecological path for visitors will be created after the restoration. The open-air museum will function as a scientific and educational hospital.\n\n\n== Historical events ==\n\nOf special interest on Titovskaya Sopka is the terraced cellar cape on the northwestern slope, surrounded by the Moskovsky Tract. On the cape there was a grave of a convict soldier of the rebellious Semyonovsky Life Guards Regiment (1820). In 1827–30, the Decembrist M. S. Lunin erected a massive larch cross on the grave, which was depicted in watercolors by the Decembrist N. A. Bestuzhev and preserved until the 1860s.\nIn 1998, a cast-iron cross was consecrated at this place by Bishop Innokenty of Chita and Transbaikal. In 2002, the Chapel of St. Alexander Nevsky was erected at the place of the cross.\nIn 1906, on the slope of Titovskaya Sopka were shot the leaders of the Chita Republic A. A. Kosciuszko-Valyuzhanich (Grigorovich), I. A. Weinstein, E. V. Tsupsman, P. E. Stolyarov. In 1926 a monument was erected in memory of this tragic event.\n\n\n== Current condition ==\nThe lower parts of the slopes of Titovskaya Sopka are occupied by the suburbs of Chita, the higher parts by potato fields. On the western slope there is the Chita cemetery No. 2. The forest on the hill has been largely cut down and artificial steppe has been created. In the 1960s there were attempts to replant the forest, which should be continued. Till 1993, Titov Sopka housed the plant collections of the Zabaykalsky Botanical Garden.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Titovskaya Sopka in culture ==\nLeonid Vorobyov's song \"What's behind Titovskaya Sopka, Mother\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nТитовская сопка. ez.chita.ru.

        "content": "Untamed World is the 10th episode of the first season of The Ren & Stimpy Show that originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on 10 November 1991.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn a parody of nature documentaries, Ren is Marlon Höek, the host of a nature show, Untamed World and Stimpy is his bumbling assistant. The duo travel to the Galapagos islands to study the \"organisms\" as Ren calls the wildlife. The duo find strange and grotesque animals that all resemble themselves in some way. Ren chases after the rare Speckle-Throated Burrowing Five-Toed Yak, but Stimpy accidentally shoots him with a tranquilizer and tags him by the ear. Ren gets his revenge by tagging Stimpy's tongue.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of John Kricfalusi\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nThe Turtle-voice of Harris Peet\nThe Seagull-voice of Billy West\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe episode was conceived in October 1990 and spent much of 1991 in production. John Kricfalusi, the showrunner, came up with the idea of a spoof of nature documentaries, and was deeply involved in the production, insisting on reviewing personally every drawing for the episode. Many of the drawings for Untamed World were done by Jim Smith, one of the top illustrators at the Spümcø studio. The actual task of drawing in and painting all of the frames one by one was assigned to the Lacewood studio in Ottawa. The lower value of the Canadian dollar to the American dollar led to the task of performing the laborious and time-consuming task of doing all of the drawings one by one being sub-contracted out to Canadian studios. Jamie Oliff, the boss of the Lacewood studio admitted that quality animation was not the strongest suit of his poorly paid workers and admitted that much of the poor visual quality of Untamed World was due to the work done by his studio.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe American critic Dawn Taylor rated Untamed World as one of the best episodes of the first season that featured \"some truly disturbing Galapagos Island nature footage.\"\n\n\n== Books and articles ==\nDobbs, G.

        "content": "Victoria Road is a major thoroughfare in Thornton-Cleveleys, Lancashire, England. Originally known as Ramper Road, it runs for about 2 miles (3.2 km) from Station Road (at its junction with Balmoral Place) in Thornton, in the east, to South Promenade in Cleveleys, in the west. Its addresses are denoted as \"Victoria Road East\" or \"Victoria Road East\", the split occurring at the Amounderness Way roundabout carrying traffic of the A585 between Poulton-le-Fylde and Fleetwood. The road picks up the B5412 designation from Station Road until The Crescent and Brighton Avenue (the A587) in Cleveleys.\nBlackpool Tramway crosses Victoria Road West at the junction of Rossall Road, The Crescent and Brighton Avenue in Cleveleys.\nThe westernmost section of Victoria Road, in Cleveleys, is known for its plethora of cafes. This section is often called the \"jewel in Wyre's crown\", although Victoria Road West received widespread support for road-safety improvements in 2023.\n\n\n== History ==\nAccording to Ben Bowman of the Blackpool Gazette and Herald: \"At Cleveleys there was no highway to Thornton until Ramper Road (now Victoria Road) was constructed of gravel over the marsh to Thornton, under an order called the Marsh Act Award of 1805,\" but a 1786 William Yates map shows Ramper Road was already in place. It is possible that the road continued almost exactly 1 mile (1.6 km) beyond its current eastern terminus to Bulker Ford at Skippool Creek, which is believed to have been a Roman crossing over the River Wyre to Hambleton.A river, believed to be a distributary of the River Wyre, once followed the route of Victoria Road. Borehole samples have provided evidence of a major watercourse.\n\n\n== Junctions ==\nVictoria Road forms junctions with the below major roads (listed from east to west):\n\nFleetwood Road (at Four Lane Ends) (B5268)\nAmounderness Way (A585)\nNorth Drive\nThe Crescent, Brighton Avenue and Rossall Road (all the A587)\n\n\n== Notable landmarks ==\nThornton Centre\nThornton Library\nThornton Sports Centre\nMarsh Farmhouse (built in 1803; Grade II listed)\nVictoria Hotel\nCleveleys Hotel (demolished)\nThe Regal HotelJ. L. Bean Bakers is the oldest shop on Victoria Road West. It has been in business since 1933.Neal's Family Bakery on Victoria Road West was established in 1938. It announced plans to close in March 2024, but was saved by a new owner.\n\n\n=== Business closures ===\nFredericks, a clothing store established in 1989, closed in 2024.Victoria Road West's TSB Bank was one of seventy branches which closed in 2022.Argos closed its Victoria Road West store in 2020, one of 120 such closures nationwide.\n\n\n== Public transportation ==\nVictoria Road is served by Blackpool Transport's routes 7A and 75, Transpora's routes 24, 648 and 660 and Archway Travel's 526.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jack Ridley is a former competitive swimmer who was an All American at Central Washington University and a Hall of Fame swim coach best known for coaching  the Lake Washington and Chinook Swim Clubs in the greater Seattle area from around 1971–1995, and the six-time state championship girls swim team at Newport High School in nearby Bellevue, Washington from 1976-1982.\n\n\n== High School swimming ==\nRidley attended and swam for the Hudson's Bay High School Eagles in Vancouver, Washington, under Coach Lowel Neil. In a February 1963 meet, he won the 200-yard freestyle in 2:04.6, and the 100-yard freestyle in 55.8. The Hudson's Bay Eagles swim team went undefeated in Ridley's Senior year, and took a third place at the State Meet.\n\n\n== College swimming ==\nHe was a National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) finalist for four years at Central Washington University in Ellensburg, Washington, where he swam under accomplished coaches Tom Anderson and Bob Gregson from around 1964–68.  He earned All-American honors at Central Washington.  In March 1964, Ridley competed in the 50, 100, 1,650-yard and freestyle relay events at the NAIA Swim Championships in St. Paul, Minnesota. As an underclassman at Washington State he took a sixth place in the 100 freestyle with a :51.6, helping to lead Central Washington State to a team third place at the NAIA Championships at LaCrosse University in LaCrosse, Wisconsin on March 20, 1965. Ridley helped Central Washington win successive Evergreen Conference Championships, taking a conference record time of 22.8 seconds in the 50-yard freestyle in the Evergreen Conference Championships on February 24–5, 1967.  His time equalled his own conference record set the previous year.\n\n\n== Coaching ==\nRidley's first and longest serving coaching position was with the Lake Washington Swim Club in the greater Seattle area, where he coached from 1971 to 1976, and then after a merger with Mercer Island's Chinook Swim Club around 1978 continued coaching the Chinook Club through 1995.  He coached Olympian and World Record Holder Jo Harshbarger at Lake Washington Swim Club. While at Mercer Island's Chinook Swim Club, he coached Mary Wayte, an Olympic medalist, and also coached American National Champion Ugur Taner at Chinook.  Ridley accompanied Harshbarger to the 1972 Montreal Olympics, and they were later married.\nHe was the girls' swimming coach at Newport High School in Bellevue, Washington from around 1974–1984, coaching a total of ten years.  The Newport Girl's team won six consecutive Washington State Girl's Championship titles from 1976 to 1982, with Ridley continuing to coach the girls' team through at least 1984.  He coached the boy's team at Newport for a period in the mid-70's.  He coached the Mercer High School Boy's team from 1988 to 1995.  In his swimming career, he managed, trained and mentored 54 All-American swimmers.\nHe served as the head coach of the Turkish men’s national swim team during the Summer Olympic Games in Barcelona in 1992.\nRidley coached American swimmers twice at World Swimming Championships and in a number of international competitions.  As of 2012, he was living in Vancouver, Washington, and working as an Assistant Senior Coach at Portland Aquatic Club.\n\n\n== Honors ==\nRidley became a member of the Pacific Northwest Swimmng Hall of Fame in 2004, and in 2007 became a member of the Washington Interscholastic Swim Coaches Association Hall of Fame.  He has also been honored with the National Interscholastic Swimming Coaches Association (NISCA) David H. Robertson Excellence in Coaching Award.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was formed by members of the Forum of the Democratic Right, which functioned within the Democratic Union (Poland), activists of the Republican Coalition and Upper Silesian-Dąbrowa Basin Conservative-Liberal Group, a faction of the Liberal Democratic Congress. In parliament, its representatives (8 posełs, 6 from UD, 2 from KLD) joined the Polish Convention.\nIn the 1993 Polish parliamentary election, the Conservative Party started as part of the Catholic Electoral Committee \"Fatherland\", which gained 878,445 (6,37%), and did not cross the 8% electoral threshold.\nIn the Spring of 1993, the party joined the November 11th Agreement. In February 1994, a group of activists left the party, creating the Conservative Coalition. A year later in the presidential elections, the Conservative Party backed the candidacy of Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz. In 1996, it signed an agreement to work with the Freedom Union, but soon later joined the Solidarity Electoral Action.\nIn January 1997, the Conservative Party entered the Conservative People's Party, and dissolved itself.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Derdas I (Ancient Greek: Δέρδας) was the ruler of the region of Elimiotis (Ἐλιμιώτις), also rendered as Elymia (Ἐλιμία) and Elimeia (Ἐλίμεια), in the mid 5th century BCE.\nOur information about him comes from a few passages in Thucydides, who said that in the lead up to the Peloponnesian War (431–404), the Athenians allied with one Philip, brother of the Macedonian king Perdiccas II, who sought to claim the throne for himself.  The reason for this alliance was not explained in ancient sources, but Konstantinos Karathanasis has speculated that, in response to the recent Athenian settlement at Amphipolis (437) on Macedon's eastern frontier, Perdiccas began to restrict sales of timber to Athens, and that this was the spur that induced the Athenians to support Philip.\nThucydides, in the above cited passage, reported that in this campaign Philip was aided by Derdas, who was not specifically identified, but was presumably a member of the Macedonian nobility and probably a relative. Why Derdas would support Philip in this internecine struggle is also not known.\nDerdas appears to have died shortly after this series of events began.  After giving some background on the situation, Thucydides reported that Philip was now supported by the \"brothers of Derdas\".  He later said that when the Athenians were marching on Potidaea (one of the early engagements of the war), they were joined by \"six hundred Macedonian horsemen, the followers of Philip and Pausanias\".  A later scholiast commented that Pausanias was either a son or brother of Derdas.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nSmith, William.

        "content": "The zoology museum of Trinity College Dublin was formed in 1777 at Regent House, Strand Street in Dublin, Ireland. Robert Ball on appointment as Director (1844–1857), donated his personal collection, and was largely responsible for amassing most of the material by gift, purchase, through personal contacts and especially through the Dublin University Zoological Association. Thomas Coulter further strengthened the collections which came to include insect cabinets by James Tardy and John Curtis.An 1876 building was specifically designed to house the collection. Today it is housed in a small area on the first floor.\nSignificant specimens include an Irish Great Auk, an early marsupial collection including a thylacine, a kākāpō, a, \"Great Indian Rhinoceros\" (partial) and birds collected by Charles Darwin. A collection of Blaschka glass models of marine life date from c.1870.\n\n\n== Mentions ==\nDecember 16, 1854.

These skeletons are very nearly perfect, being furnished with all the small bones and the incisor teeth ; only a few pieces of the tail being deficient. The female is very elegant, the lightness of the cervical vertebras and the slender limbs presenting a marked contrast to the males. This is supposed to be the only skeleton of the female that has been preserved in any tolerable condition. Besides the skeletons, the Museum possesses six sets of horns, in a series from an early age up to the maximum growth; a very fine small head, with short horns, and a beautifully perfect set of teeth.Natural History Review.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLeskean Cabinet\nNational Museum of Ireland – Natural History\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\nMartyn Linnie, 2024 The Unnatural History of Animals: Tales from a Zoological Museum  Red Stripe,Dublin\nGood,J.A. and  Linnie, M. 1990 The History of the Early Nineteenth Century Coleoptera Collection of James Tardy at Trinity College, Dublin, and the Validity of Records Based on His Collection.The Irish Naturalists' Journal Vol. 23, No. 8 (Oct., 1990), pp. 298–305 (8 pages)\nChesney, H.

        "content": "Christiane Helene Berger-Schaffitzel is a German biochemist and Professor at the University of Bristol. Her research considereds the ribosome and translational control mechanism. Her research team identified that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could bind linoleic acid.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBerger-Schaffitzel studied biochemistry in University of Hannover and ETH Zurich. She moved to the University of Zurich for her doctoral research, where she ribosomes and the evolution of antibodies against proteins and nucleic acids. She returned to ETH Zurich as a postdoctoral researcher in 2001, and was eventually made a lecturer.\n\n\n== Research and career ==\nIn 2007 Berger-Schaffitzel was made team leader at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory. She was made a professor of biochemistry at the University of Bristol in 2014. Her research focusses on the complexes involved in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. She makes use of ribosome and naïve antibody display libraries to identify neutralising binders that have high affinity against specific toxins. Supported by a European Research Council Horizon grant, Berger-Schaffitzel developed a snakebite treatment for Sub-Saharan Africa. At Bristol Berger-Schaffitzel established a facility for cryogenic electron microscopy.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic Berger-Schaffitzel started working on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. She used cryo em to show it could bind Linoleic Acid. When Linoleic Acid binds to the spike protein it interferes with SARS-CoV-2 infection and inhibits viral replication. Following this discovery Berger-Schaffitzel founded HALO Therapeutics to create a respiratory antiviral spray for coronaviruses. In 2021 Bristol Live named Berger-Schaffitzel one of the most influential women in Bristol.\n\n\n== Select publications ==\nChristiane Schaffitzel; Imre Berger; Jan Postberg; Jozef Hanes; Hans J.

He was the son of John Propert (1792–1867), surgeon, by his wife Juliana Ross. His father founded in 1855 the Royal Medical Benevolent College, Epsom, of which he was long treasurer. Propert was educated at Marlborough College (Aug. 1843–Dec. 1847), and at King's College Hospital. He obtained the diploma of the Royal College of Surgeons of England and the licence of the Society of Apothecaries in 1855, and in 1857 he graduated M.B. with honours in medicine at the University of London. He then joined his father in general practice in New Cavendish Street, London, and became highly successful.\nPropert was widely known in artistic circles as a good etcher and a connoisseur of art. His house, 112 Gloucester Place, Portman Square, was filled with beautiful specimens of Wedgwood, bronzes, and jewelled work. He was credited with being one of the first to revive the taste for miniature painting in England. His very fine collection of miniatures was dispersed by sale in 1897. He published in 1887 'A History of Miniature Art, Notes on Collectors and Collections,' and compiled in 1889, with introduction, the illustrated catalogue of the exhibition of portrait miniatures at the Burlington Fine Arts Club.\nPropert died at his house in Gloucester Place on 7 March 1902, and was buried at Brookwood cemetery. He married in 1864 Mary Jessica, daughter of William Hughes of Worcester, and had three sons and three daughters, of whom a son and three daughters survived him.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Power, D'Arcy (1912). \"Blackadder, John Lumsden\".

He then transitioned to roles in Australia, including positions at CSIRO Plant Industry in Canberra and Perth.\nSince 2005, Turner has been based at the University of Western Australia as Interim Director of the Centre for Legumes in Mediterranean Agriculture (2006–2007) and adjunct professor in the UWA Institute of Agriculture.\nTurner's leadership roles include being a Research/Program Leader and Officer-in-Charge at the Dryland Crops and Soils Research Unit, CSIRO Plant Industry, Perth, Western Australia, from 1984 to 1995. He has also held visiting research professor positions at University of Aberdeen (1973), Bayreuth University (1982), Würzburg University (1993), Lanzhou University, China (2007-), Northwest Agricultural and Forestry University, China (2017-).\n\n\n== Research ==\nThroughout his career, Turner's research interests have focused on agronomic and physiological responses of crops and trees to water deficits, adaptation of crops to water-limited environments, rainfall-use efficiency, climate change impacts on crop production, stomatal behavior, plant water relations, drought and salinity tolerance, osmotic adjustment, high and low temperature stress, and early vigor. He has worked extensively with crops and trees, including wheat, oats, lupin, chickpea, maize, rice, sorghum, tobacco, cotton, soybean, sunflowers, and several Brassica species.\n\n\n== Contributions ==\nTurner has served as a UNESCO/FAO consultant at the UNDP Centre for Soil and Water Management, Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar, India (1978), and as a Visiting Research Scientist at the International Rice Research Institute, Los Baños, Philippines (1983). Turner contributed with organizations such as the International Centre for Research in Agroforestry (now World Agroforestry Center) and the International Crop Science Congress.\n\n\n== Honors and awards ==\nTurner received fellowships from the American Society of Agronomy, the Crop Science Society of America, the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering, the Australian Institute of Agricultural Science and Technology and the Indian Academy of Agricultural Sciences. He was awarded the Humboldt Research Award, the Centenary Medal for service to Australian society in environmental science, and the Chancellor's Medal from The University of Western Australia, among others.\nIn 2021, Turner was appointed as a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for his service to agricultural and environmental science, and to education.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nNeil Turner is married with three adult married sons and eight grandchildren. He resides in Waterman's Bay, Western Australia.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Dale T. Umetsu is an American physician, immunologist, and researcher known for his contributions to the studies of allergies and asthma. He was the Prince Turki Bin Abdul Aziz al Saud Professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School andhas  held professorships at Stanford University,University of California, San Francisco,and Boston Children's Hospital.\nHe has conducted research into the immunobiology of allergic diseases and asthma, with a particular focus on immune cell subsets and translational medicine.\n\n\n== Education ==\nHe received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Columbia University and pursued his medical and doctoral degrees (MD/PhD) from New York University. He completed his internship, residency, and fellowship in allergy/immunology at Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School.\n\n\n== Career ==\nUmetsu began his academic career at Stanford University, where he served as a professor, Chief of Allergy/Immunology, and Director of the Asthma Center. In 2005, he returned to Harvard Medical School as the Prince Turki Bin Abdul Aziz al Saud Professor of Pediatrics, and performed laboratory research funded by the NIH for more than 20 years.\nHe served Society for Mucosal Immunology as Treasurer from 2007 to 2011, as a member of the editorial board of Mucosal Immunology from 2008, as associate editor from 2009 to the present, as a board member of the American Academy of Allergy, and Immunology from 2002 to 2007, member of the Allergenic Products Advisory Committee, CBER FDA 1998–2002, and as a Study Section chair with the NIH Center for Scientific Review from 1998 to 2000.\nIn 2013, Umetsu left academic medicine to become Principal Medical Director in Respiratory and Allergic Diseases and Global Development Lead for Xolair.at Genentech.\nAt Genentech, he led the team that obtained FDA approval of Xolair for pediatric asthma, for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, the Xolair liquid formulation and for food allergy.\n\n\n== Research ==\nUmetsu's research interests encompass the immunobiology of allergic diseases and asthma, focusing on subsets of CD4 T cells, NKT cells, Treg cells, and innate lymphoid cells. He has published over 200 manuscripts and holds nine patents, and has been working in translational medicine in asthma and food allergies.\nUmetsu's research demonstrated omalizumab in reducing allergic reactions, particularly in individuals with severe allergies, his work culminated in a Phase 3 study in collaboration with the NIH and subsequent FDA approval of omalizumab for food allergy in 2024.\nIn 2004, Umetsu led a team that developed vaccines that reduced or eliminated dogs' allergic reactions to peanuts, milk, and wheat. Umetsu's approach, using heat-killed Listeria mixed with allergens, targets the hygiene hypothesis.\nHis work include mechanisms underlying asthma and allergies, including the role of immune cells such as Th2 cells, mast cells, eosinophils, and natural killer T cells and innate lymphoid cells.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nResearchgate Profile\nStanford profile\nUmetsu's research",

        "content": "Calypso, Brega Calypso or just Brega-pop, is a Brazilian musical genre that emerged in the Brazilian city of Belém (state of Pará), by mixing elements of Pará's regional genres such as lambada, carimbó, guitarrada, siriá, with international music from Caribbean countries, such as calypso, ska, reggae. It developed in the 1990s at concerts and dances in nightclubs on the outskirts of town and through street vendors promoting the production of small local/independent musicians.\nIt was created by musicians from the state of Pará in the city of Belém, who decided to combine the traditional regional brega with other rhythms from Caribbean music such as calypso, from which point the name of this fusion also became calypso.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nBrega was a term used pejoratively to designate popular romantic music of low quality and with dramatic exaggerations (love disappointments) or naivety; with samba-canção, bolero and jovem-guarda linked to it.The musical origin of \"brega\" is not known for sure, but singer Vicente Celestino (1894-1968) in the 1930s is considered to be one of the precursors of brega as a dramatic musical genre, followed by: Orlando Dias, Carlos Alberto and Cauby Peixoto.\nDuring the 1960s, the romantic music of artists was basically from the lower classes and came to be considered tacky and inelegant. This was especially reinforced by the transformations experienced by the country's popular music in that period, with the emergence of stylistic innovations on the music scene that appealed mainly to young people in urban areas. On the one hand, a generation emerged from the university-educated middle classes that would consolidate, in the following decade, under the acronym MPB, no less than \"Brazilian popular music\". On the other, the Tropicália movement - inspired by avant-garde artistic currents and national and foreign pop culture and by traditional manifestations of Brazilian culture and radical aesthetic innovations - and the Iê-iê-iê movement - which led the way for foreign rock'n'roll, giving it a national dressing, and became a major behavioral and fashion phenomenon.And it was the Jovem Guarda that paved the way for new artists who challenged the standards of good taste of the Brazilian middle class in the following decade, since some of the artists who had a connection with the movement would become popular \"tacky\" singers in the following decade. This was the case, for example, with Reginaldo Rossi, from Pernambuco, who led the band The Silver Jets.But it was in the North and Northeast that \"brega\" resisted and consolidated itself as a major musical force. Although radio stations and major record labels began to ignore its existence, \"brega\" artists continued to produce and assimilate new influences. Even with limited investment capital and technical support, these musicians maintained a significant audience in the urban peripheries of these regions, outside the cultural coverage of the hegemonic media.\" Belém do Pará became the main reference in the consolidation of \"brega\" as a musical style in the country. Initially restricted to circuits of dances and concerts - called \"bregões\" - in nightclubs on the outskirts of Belém, the scene acquired great regional proportions with the \"aparelhagens\" (large, powerful professional sound systems) of the big popular parties, attended by thousands of people, usually characterized by music typical of the northern region.\n\n\n=== 1990's ===\nWith the rise of brega in the state of Pará in the 1990s, the rhythm began to increase on the outskirts of Pará. As a result, Pará musicians quickly came up with the idea of fusing brega with the state's traditional rhythms such as lambada, carimbó, guitarrada, and siriá, as well as Caribbean rhythms such as calypso from Trinidad and Tobago and ska and reggae from Jamaica, as well as Caribbean rhythms such as calypso from Trinidad and Tobago and ska and reggae from Jamaica, which contained lyrics that criticized the colonialism of the time. These Caribbean styles arrived in Pará across the state border with the Guianas. The mixture of these new sounds with Pará's brega influenced a new strand called \"brega pop\" or \"brega Calypso\", which also came to be called Calypso, just like Caribbean's original. The name \"brega pop\" was coined by broadcasters Jorge Reis, Rosenildo Franco, and Marquinho Pinheiro, who noticed a more pop feel to this new genre compared to the old brega. With lyrics that still generally dealt with disillusionment, abusive relationships, and love betrayals, typical of brega lyrics - although often veering into explicit eroticization, Pará's \"calypso\" distanced itself from its main strand, as it was characterized by a faster rhythm, with an emphasis on the chord of the guitars, brass instruments and a strong sonic weight in the drums. Various music producers, such as Dedê Borges, Hélio Silva, Manoel Cordeiro, Cléo Pinheiro, Tonny Brasil and Cláudio Lemos, produced countless artists who were very successful, expanding \"Brega Pop\" throughout the North and Northeast!In Pará, brega pop or brega Calypso soon began to be included in new songs by singers such as Wanderley Andrade, Banda Sayonara, Edílson Moreno, Adilson Ribeiro, Banda Quero Mais, Mário Senna, Alberto Moreno, Nelsinho Rodrigues, Bruce Waldo, Kim Marques, and others. In the 1990s, the crisis in the record industry and technological advances transformed the brega music market. Outside the scope of the national recording industry, the musical production of \"calypso\" from Pará was distributed directly by street vendors and camelôs, consolidating an alternative market. The rhythm quickly spread to other states in the north of Brazil. At the end of the decade, music producer and guitarist Cledivan Almeida Farias, known as Ximbinha, became one of the main producers of the calypso style in the whole of Pará, featuring his guitar on most of the CDs by artists on the Pará scene at the time. In 1999, together with his wife at the time, the singer Joelma Mendes, Ximbinha formed the greatest national exponent of the movement that become Banda Calypso.\n\n\n=== 2000's ===\nThe 2000s were marked by the popularization of calypso throughout Brazil. With the creation of Banda Calypso - the band mainly responsible for spreading the style - the rhythm began to spread to other Brazilian states in the early 2000s.In the north-east of Brazil, Banda Calypso was quickly accepted for its musicality. Their songs with a romantic and dance appeal soon became a real fever throughout the country. Although it developed in the parallel market of the peripheries, in this decade \"brega pop\" has become an extremely lucrative business and has regained space in local media throughout the country, with a presence on the programming of the big commercial radio stations. With the success of Banda Calypso, in 2001 onwards, several bands with the same sound and/or the same name calypso began to appear, which soon also began to become popular throughout Brazil, such as - Companhia do Calypso, Planeta Calypso, Furacão do Calypso, Banda da Loirinha and Banda Kassikó.These bands still had lyrics that were generally romantic, although often sensual, most of them were accompanied by a group of vocalists with more than one singer, almost always a blonde, who sang and danced on a stage surrounded by dancers who reproduced marked choreographies, which generally portrayed in a dancing way what was sung in the lyrics. These groups have gained national prominence in all regions of Brazil, with bands of this style appearing on the main national television programs, recording DVDs with large structures, and their managers making a lot of money.\n\n\n=== 2010's ===\nWith the popularization of the tecnobrega style (techno + brega), the result of the fusion of brega with electronic music styles, during the 2010s, calypso ceased to be preferred by the state's bands, singers and artists, who preferred to record what was hot at the time, with calypso losing many of its representatives and losing much of the popularity it had enjoyed in the previous decade.\nWith the end of Banda Calypso and the dissolution of many other calypso bands, the singer Joelma Mendes continued to record calypso songs in her solo career. Her ex-husband, the musician Ximbinha, formed a new calypso band called XCalypso.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCalypso music\nBrega (music)\nTecno brega\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Cretan expedition occurred in August 949, where the Byzantine army invaded the island of Crete which was held by the Arabs. The expedition ended in fiasco for the Byzantine army.\nIn 949, the Byzantine emperor, Constantine VII, planned a new campaign to reconquer Crete. Aware of the costly failure of 911 campaign, Constantine planned a minor, cheaper, and more cautious campaign. He deployed fleets to keep an eye over the Aegean and Mediterranean, reaching to Spain and north Africa. With so many ships on guard duty.\nIn Summer 949, the Byzantine dispatched a fleet of 60 ships consisting of 10,000 marines and 5,700 soldiers and mercenaries. Other source state that the Byzantines had only 4,100 men for the campaign. The expedition was led by the eunuch, Constantine Gongyles. The Byzantine landed on the island without opposition on August 949.\nGongyles failed to fortify his camp or scout the Arabs, which left him exposed. The Arabs launched a surprise counterattack, killing many of the soldiers and capturing the rest along their camp. Gongyles and a small part of his fleet managed to escape this disaster. The failure of the expedition was largely due to Gongyles incompetence.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nWarren T.

        "content": "The Hollywood Independent Music Awards (HIMA) is an awards organization that honors independent artists, composers, songwriters, record labels, and studio recording professionals for their creative contributions to independent music. The independent music categories were once a part of the HMMA's, but they evolved and expanded into a mainstream awards event, with major film music categories, nominees, and winners including Billie Eilish, Rhianna, Olivia Rodrigo, Ludwig Göransson, Danny Elfman, Hans Zimmer, and Austin Butler. Hosting a separate awards show for independent artists was decided by founder Brent Harvey after an increased engagement from independent artists internationally. The first inaugural HIMA ceremony was held on August 17, 2023 at the Avalon Hollywood in Hollywood, California.\nThe HIMA's also held its, Everything Blue, portion of the awards ceremony at the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame in Owensboro, Kentucky, honoring independent artists in blues and bluegrass music on August 12, 2023.  The event was hosted by the Voice's Season 18 winner, Todd Tilghman.\n\n\n== Winners and nominees ==\n\n\n=== Categories ===\n\n\n=== Studio Recording Professionals ===\n\n\n=== Special recognition ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Xinjiang Zhongtai Group (Chinese: 新疆中泰集团有限责任公司) is a state owned business group in China. It was founded in 2001 and has been listed in the Fortune Global 500 companies. The group has been listed in the Shenzhen stock market since 2006 and has 43 wholly owned subsidiaries; along officially 22.700 employees in 2019. It operates investment, asset management, and other businesses.\nThe involvement in forced Uyghur labour brought the company international attention and US sanctions.\nThe company is mostly producing PVC, ionic membrane caustic soda and calcium carbide and further chemicals. causing multiple environmental and health hazards. They are as well involved in textile and agricultural production in Xinjiang and produce 20% of China's cotton.\nThey have several subsidiaries, making it difficult to oversee their activities. They run at least 32 subsidiaries manufacturing clothes, including the Xinjiang Linhua group, responsible for expropriation and Guangzhou Zhongtai New Material Co. (广东中泰新\n材料科技有限公司).\n\n\n== Human rights violations ==\nThe Zhongtai Group is responsible for the transfer of more than 5,000 citizens to be \"sur-\nplus laborers\". Confirmed by state media and corporate publicity.\nZhongtai is involved in reeducation programs. They operate ideological and vocational training facilities passed by thousands of rural farmers. There they teach vocational skills, anti-terrorism, labor discipline, ethnic unity, patriotism, cultural skills and\nlegal knowledge, as well how \"to bear hardships and stand hard work.\" They make use of these workers at Zhongtai and other local companies.\nThere is evidence for about 1000 people being forced to work at Zhongtai's Aral Fulida cotton and viscose processing\nplant.\nXinjiang Lihua Cotton Industry Co. also profited from land transfers of Indigenous lands, retrieved by the state. Between 2017 and March 2018 alone they transferred about 1.95 million mu of Uyghur Region residents' land, involving thousands of farmers.\nIn Shayar Country, Lihua 'accompanied' farmers in investing their land in cooperatives, who then  transferred the land to the company for unified management. The farmers, landless and jobless, are then transferred to work in the factories. Through this system the company justifies the transfer of former farmers to their factories.\n\n\n== International affairs ==\nThe US department of Homeland security put the company on a list of sanctioned companies in September 2023 because of their use of Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, or members of other persecuted groups by forced labour in Xinjiang region.\nThey co-operate with the German BASF, one of the biggest global suppliers of chemicals.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ursquilla (meaning \"primeval Squilla\", in comparison to the related modern genus) is an extinct genus of mantis shrimp that lived in Israel and Jordan during the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous period. It contains a single species, Ursquilla yehoachi.\n\n\n== Discovery and naming ==\nThe first known specimen of Ursquilla (MNHN R. 62691) was discovered in Nahal Tze'elim (formerly known as the Ouadi Seiyal Valley), Israel near a road leading from Beersheba to Mount Sodom, likely in the vicinity of Arad, and is kept in the National Museum of Natural History, France. The deposits in which it originates are part of the Campanian-aged Chert Member of the Mishash Formation, and cover the southeastern flank of the anticline of the Judaean Mountains. This specimen was first described by Jean Marcel Remy and Moché Avnimelech in 1955, who identified it as the carapace of an eryonid crustacean. They designated this fossil as the holotype of a new species which they named Eryon yehoachi. The specific name honors M. Yehoach, who collected the specimen.\nIn 1969, it was published in the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology that Martin Glaessner stated the Eryon yehoachi type specimen is not a carapace, but actually represents the telson and part of the sixth abdominal segment of a mantis shrimp. It was further stated that the specimen may belong to the extant genus Squilla, but was not complete enough for certain identification. This identification was further supported by Cees H.J. Hof, who formally redescribed the specimen in 1998 and established the genus Ursquilla, renaming the species as Ursquilla yehoachi. The generic name combines the prefix ur (meaning \"primeval\") with the genus Squilla, referencing its ancient age and similarity to the extant genus. Furthermore, Hof assigned three additional specimens to the species; one of which (GSI M-8113) belongs to the collection of the Geological Survey of Israel and was collected from the Chert Member of the Mishash Formation, in the northern flank of the Hazera anticline, Israel by Dr. S. Ilani in 1994. The other two specimens are preserved together in the same slab (BMNH I 7316) found in the outcrops of the Amman Formation east of Al-Karak, Jordan, presented in May 1906 and kept in the London Natural History Museum. All these fossils preserve only the tail fan of the animal. An epoxy resin cast of the type specimen is also kept in the London Natural History Museum and labelled as BMNH I 15472.\nA fifth specimen was found by Stan Natkaniec in the Negev Desert, Israel during a private trip and donated to the State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart. This fossil (designated as SMNS 67703) preserves the tail fan and last three abdominal segments of the animal. It was identified as a specimen of U. yehoachi by Günter Schweigert and described in a paper published in 2013, which also reevaluated the four previously known Ursquilla specimens.\n\n\n== Description ==\nKnown specimens of Ursquilla have preserved only the tail fan and last three segments of the abdomen. Size of the telson varies between specimens from 2.4–3.2 cm (0.94–1.26 in) in length and 2.4–3.0 cm (0.94–1.18 in) in width, with the smallest specimens proposed to represent immature individuals. Taking 2.8 cm (1.1 in) as an average telson length and assuming the animal had body proportions matching modern squilloid mantis shrimp such as Squilla mantis, it has been estimated that Ursquilla reached a total length of 17–18 cm (6.7–7.1 in).\n\n\n=== Abdomen ===\nBased on other mantis shrimp, the animal presumably had six abdominal segments, thus the known segments would be the fourth to sixth. The sixth abdominal segment is decorated with four pairs of keels designated as (in order of increasing distance from the center) the submedian, intermediate, lateral and marginal keels. Apart from the marginal keels, all are ornamented with a row of tubercles. The submedian keels are straight and show a gradual increase in height down the animal's length before abruptly ending at the hind margin of the segment. The intermediate keels are slightly curved and less pronounced. The lateral and marginal keels are preserved only in the sixth abdominal segment of one specimen (GSI M-8113), showing the lateral keels are straight while the marginal keels are positioned obliquely, fusing with the lateral keels at the back of the segment. The fourth and fifth abdominal segments are only preserved in one specimen (SMNS 67703) and not preserved as well as the sixth, but appear mostly similar to it in structure apart from having less pronounced ridges.\n\n\n=== Telson ===\nThe telson is vaguely rectangular in shape, about as long as it is broad and with convex side margins. Three pairs of teeth-like protrusions are present on the margins, with the hindmost pair protruding from the back margin of the telson. The protrusions of the hindmost pair are inflated over their length, and each is decorated with four to six tubercles which decrease in size down the length of the protrusions. The other two pairs of protrusions are less pronounced and lack tubercles. Between the middle and hindmost protrusions on each side are a row of four serrations of equal size, known as intermediate denticles. Four addition serrations known as submedian denticles are present on the very back of the telson between the hindmost pair of protrusions, arranged into two pairs (one pair on either side of the telson midline). From the middle protrusions to the front of the telson, the telson margin is inflated, forming a rounded marginal keel decorated with small tubercles. Halfway between the frontmost pair of protrusions and the front margin of the telson is a crease known as the prelateral lobe (a feature seen in derived squilloid mantis shrimp).\nDown the middle of the telson is a robust and rounded keel known as the median keel, which starts a few millimeters behind the front margin of the telson and ends a few millimeters in front of the submedian denticles. The median keel is flanked on either side by a straight row of tubercles. At the side of each row of tubercles is another keel called the submedian keel. This paired submedian keels have small tubercles on their surface and stretch down the length of the telson, almost lining up with hindmost pair of marginal teeth-like protrusions. The submedian keels are mostly straight but curve slightly towards the sides at the front. Another pair of keels known as the lateral keels run close to the telson margins, and are also decorated with tubercles. The lateral keels are curved, together almost forming an ovular outline, and nearly merge with the submedian keels and hindmost marginal protrusions at their end. A short ridge connects each lateral keel to the marginal keel near it, at which pint there is also a small protrusion of the lateral keel pointing towards the telson center.\n\n\n=== Uropods ===\nThe uropods are biramous (branched into two) and preserved in two of the known Ursquilla specimens: GSI M-8113 only preserves incomplete parts of them, while SMNS 67703 preserves them better. The protopod (basal segment) has a curved keel on its outer margin, a branched median keel with small tubercles, and a short keel near the base of the protopod running parallel to the margin of the abdomen. The endopod (inner branch) has an elongated ovular shape and possibly a keel down the middle. SMNS 67703 shows that the exopod (outer branch) is composed of two parts, the proximal part being subrectangular and slightly C-shaped, articulated against the smaller and paddle-shaped distal part. However, GSI M-8113 only poorly preserved the exopod, thus Hof (1998) claims it appears to be made of only one segment. SMNS 67703 shows possibly up to 11 backward-pointing articulated spines along the outer margin of the proximal part of the exopod. The spines increase in length away from the base of the exopod, with the closest to the base measuring 2 mm (0.079 in) and the second closest to the tip measuring 7 mm (0.28 in). The closest spine to the tip of the exopod is broken off, but presumably is the longest. The paddle-like distal part of the exopod is estimated to be 12 mm (0.47 in) long and 6 mm (0.24 in) wide in SMNS 67703, but has only been preserved faintly. There is some indication of setae (bristles) along the rim of this part.\n\n\n== Classification ==\nIn his initial description of Ursquilla, Hof (1998) established the monotypic family Ursquillidae to accommodate the genus. Recognizing the similarity of Ursquilla to the modern genus Squilla, he assigned the family to the superfamily Squilloidea. However, an analysis by Shane T. Ahyong published in 2005 found that despite its age, Ursquilla is a highly derived member of the extant family Squillidae, showing that this family had already greatly diversified by the Late Cretaceous period, and thus Ursquillidae was declared a junior synonym of Squillidae. This result was further supported by the later discovery of an additional Ursquilla specimen, revealing a prelateral lobe on the telson like that found in other squillids.\nA phylogenetic analysis conducted by Smith et al. (2023) recovered Squillidae as a non-monophyletic grouping, with Nodosculda (traditionally placed in Sculdidae) being the closest relative to Squilla mantis despite the latter and Ursquilla having previously been assigned to the same family. However, it is also proposed that such an unconventional result may be due to the fact that Ursquilla, Nodosculda and Lysiosquilla nkporoensis are poorly known, and more material of squillids is needed to resolve the relationships of the group. The results of the analysis are displayed below:\n\n\n== Paleobiology ==\nCees H.J. Hof first noted in 1998 that the known specimens of Ursquilla show variation in the shape of the telson, with those of the two specimens from the Jordanian slab (BMNH I 7316) being more elongated and the keels being less inflated in comparison to the telsons of other known specimens from Israel. He suggested that this may be a preservational artifact. However, it was later pointed out by Haug et al. (2013) that since the two Jordanian specimens are preserved close together on the same slab but oriented in different directions, tectonic deformation would not cause them both to be elongated the same way. Instead, they propose that telson variation among known specimens was actually due to ontogeny, with the telson becoming relatively wider and its keels becoming more inflated as the animal grew older. This is supported by the fact that the most elongated telsons are from the smallest known specimens (the two fossils on the Jordanian slab), while the largest known specimen of Ursquilla (the holotype, MNHN R. 62691) shows the proportionally broadest telson and most inflated keels. Though the idea of the telson variation being an example of sexual dimorphism was also considered, telson ratio differences between sexes has not been reported in any extant mantis shrimp, whereas keel inflation with increasing age is known from many living species, especially within the family Squillidae (which Ursquilla is a member of).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

In October 2023, AD Ports Group was awarded a second concession to develop and operate a bulk and general cargo terminal across berths 11-17 under KGTML. Collectively, AD Ports Group has operational control of a consolidated 2300 meters of quay wall on the East Wharf of Karachi Port. These concession grants to the AD Ports Group come after an inter-governmental arrangement between the Governments of UAE and Pakistan.\n\n\n== Karachi Gateway Terminal Multipurpose (Private) Limited ==\nKGTML is a joint venture between AD Ports Group, as the majority shareholder, and Kaheel Terminals of the UAE. It was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan on October 18, 2023. It operates a bulk and general cargo terminal across berths 11–17 on the East Wharf of Karachi Port under a 25-year concession.

        "content": "\"Ain't No Fun (If the Homies Can't Have None)\" is a song by American rapper Snoop Dogg from his debut studio album Doggystyle (1993). It features American singer Nate Dogg and American rappers Warren G and Kurupt. The song was produced by Dr. Dre. \n\n\n== Background ==\nIn an interview with DubCNN in July 2006, Snoop Dogg said that Daz Dillinger and Warren G brought Dr. Dre the beat but \"Dre took that muthafucka to the next level!\" In an interview with Tidal in 2016, Warren G gave some background information on the song: \"We had a lot of women and they was with it, too. Shit. We was having fun — it was protected. They'd have a bunch of their friends and we'd have a bunch of our guys and we'd just... fuck!\nIn 2013, Suge Knight indicated in an interview with Rolling Stone that the song was created by a member of the Mad Swan Bloods, adding that \"all them dudes already had a record done. And they came and played it for us in the studio. They played us the demo. Everybody looked at it like it was alright. And then after they left, shit, everybody was chopping that same beat.\"\n\n\n== Composition ==\nThe song incorporates funk elements and melodic singing from Nate Dogg, who sings the chorus. The lyrics revolve around having sexual intercourse with women; Kurupt notably raps, \"If Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch, I'd always be broke / I'd never have no motherfucking indo to smoke.\"\n\n\n== Samples ==\nThe song contains samples from \"A Few More Kisses to Go\" by Isaac Hayes, \"Think (About It)\" by Lyn Collins, \"Indo Smoke\" by Mista Grimm featuring Warren G and Nate Dogg, \"Blue Suede Shoes\" by Carl Perkins and \"Turn Off the Radio\" by Ice Cube.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nChristopher John Farley of Time mentioned the song as among the tracks from Doggystyle that are \"perfectly crafted to come booming out of Jeeps and college dorms\". Alan Jones of Music Week regarded the song as \"superb\" and wrote \"Inevitably, its lyrics are wholly unsuitable for radio. It is bound to excite extreme reactions, with enough of those of the positive variety to ensure it will be a success.\" Reviewing Doggystyle for Entertainment Weekly, David Browne had a disapproving reaction to the song, stating \"Sure, it's a swinging, hard-thumping piece of R&B craft that easily outstrips anything new jack crooner Keith Sweat has offered lately, but it also touts gang-banging as a male-bonding sports event: 'Pass it to the homie/Now you hit it,' raps one of Snoop's posse in the most callous tone possible. It's an example of how musically artful, yet lyrically repellent, this album can be.\" Touré of Rolling Stone commented in regard to the song, \"It's a funny song if you don't think about how the woman 2Pac and his homies allegedly sodomized might feel about it, but most hip-hop fans are so used to the ethical deadening hip-hop routinely demands that they won't. Pray that \"No Fun\" isn't misinterpreted by some sick fan, like Nirvana's \"Polly\" was, as an encouragement to rape.\" Ian Cohen of Stylus Magazine remarked \"'Ain't No Fun' finds me being a little conflicted; while I won't question its party credentials or its quotability, it's in the same category as 'Caress Me Down' and 'Put It in Your Mouth,' co-opted by drunken college girls who might let you hold their hand by the fourth date, but have no problem singing along with 'cause you gave me all your pussy and you even licked my balls.'\" When comparing the song to \"Bitches Ain't Shit\" by Dr. Dre, he wrote \"To be honest, I'm not settled on going with 'Ain't No Fun' here, but it has a chorus that's more acceptable to sing in public.\" Tidal's Ryan Pinkard described the song as \"wildly misogynistic\" and an \"unlikely dance floor staple\".\n\n\n== Lawsuit ==\nOn August 4, 2016, rappers Antonio White and Craig Ward filed a lawsuit against the artists alongside Dr. Dre and Suge Knight in the California Central District Court, claiming copyright infringement and fraud. According to White and Ward, they wrote an earlier version of \"Ain't No Fun\", which the chorus of the song originally appeared in and which was intended to appear on their album Volume 1 — Out to Get a Grip. Furthermore, the lawsuit stated that Suge Knight admitted to stealing the song from them in the aforementioned interview with Rolling Stone and \"The verses of both songs are concerned with homies relaxing one night, getting high and having a dialogue addressed to a female who previously had sex with the speaker, followed by suggesting an elaborate scenario, that the female should be sexually shared among the homies, described in a partly humorous, partly derisive tone.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024 Stroud District Council election is scheduled to be held on Thursday 2 May 2024, alongside the other local elections in the United Kingdom being held on the same day. All 51 members of Stroud District Council in Gloucestershire will be elected. Due to the previous election being delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, councillors face re-election after a 3-year term, rather than the usual 4.\n\n\n== Background ==\nStroud has traditionally been a Conservative council. The party held a majority on the council from 1976 to 1984, with a period of no overall control until 2002. The Conservatives remained the largest group on the council, aside from a period between 1994 and 1999, when Labour overtook them. The council again fell to no overall control in 2011, and no party has won a majority since then. In 2016, the council moved from electing by thirds to an all-out system, where all seats are contested every 4 years. \nIn the most recent election, the Conservative party won 20 seats (down 3) with 39.2% of the vote, labour won 15 (down 3) with 29.4%, the Green Party won 13 (up 5) with 25.5%, and the Liberal Democrats won 3 (up 1) with 5.9%. Following the election, Doina Cornell of the Labour Party was elected council leader, with the backing of the Green Party and Liberal Democrats. Labour lost their position as the largest party in the coalition in June 2022, following the resignation of Cornell and 3 others from the party. Green Party councillor Catherine Braun was elected leader on 22 July 2022; the council is now run by a coalition of the Green Party, the Liberal Democrats, the Community Independents group, and the Independent Left group.\n\n\n== Summary ==\n\n\n=== Council composition ===\n\nChanges:\n\nJune 2022: Doina Cornell, Colin Fryer, Trevor Hall, and Robin Layfield leave Labour to sit as independents\nSeptember 2022: Paula Baker, Natalie Bennett, Chris Brine, Helen Fenton, and Mattie Ross leave Labour to sit as independents\nApril 2023: Jason Bullingham (Conservative) resigns; by-election held May 2023\nMay 2023: Gary Luff (Green Party) gains by-election from Conservatives\nJune 2023: Laurie Davies leaves Labour to sit as an independent\nOctober 2023: Jessie Hoskin leaves Labour to sit as an independent\nDecember 2023: Norman Kay (Green Party) dies; seat left vacant until 2024 election\nFebruary 2024: Helen Fenton (independent) joins Green Party\n\n\n=== Election result ===\n\n\n== Candidates ==\nThe Statement of Persons Nominated, which details the candidates standing in each ward, was released by Stroud District Council following the close of nominations on 5 April 2024.\n\n\n=== Amberley & Woodchester ===\n\n\n=== Berkeley Vale ===\n\n\n=== Bisley ===\n\n\n=== Cainscross ===\n\n\n=== Cam East ===\n\n\n=== Cam West ===\n\n\n=== Chalford ===\n\n\n=== Coaley & Uley ===\n\n\n=== Dursley ===\n\n\n=== Hardwicke ===\n\n\n=== Kingswood ===\n\n\n=== Minchinhampton ===\n\n\n=== Nailsworth ===\n\n\n=== Painswick & Upton ===\n\n\n=== Randwick, Whiteshill & Ruscombe ===\n\n\n=== Rodborough ===\n\n\n=== Severn ===\n\n\n=== Stonehouse ===\n\n\n=== Stroud Central ===\n\n\n=== Stroud Farmhill & Paganhill ===\n\n\n=== Stroud Slade ===\n\n\n=== Stroud Trinity ===\n\n\n=== Stroud Uplands ===\n\n\n=== Stroud Valley ===\n\n\n=== The Stanleys ===\n\n\n=== Thrupp ===\n\n\n=== Wotton-under-Edge ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Samuel Merriman (25 October 1771 – 22 November 1852) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMerriman born on 25 October 1771 at Marlborough, Wiltshire, was son of Benjamin (1722–1781), who was eldest son of Nathaniel Merriman of the same place. Samuel's great-grandfather, another Nathaniel, was youngest son of John Merriman (1618–1670), a captain in the army of Cromwell (Waylen, Hist. of Marlborough; Rushworth, Hist. Coll. vii. 1351; Grove, Antiquities of Carisbrook Castle, 1 Dec. 1648; Whitelocke, Memorials). His mother, who was his father's second wife, was Mary, eldest daughter of William Hawkes of Marlborough, and niece to Sir Michael Foster the judge. The father Benjamin had a large brewery in Marlborough. He was a man of scientific pursuits, and the author of political and other essays, some of which were inserted in the ‘Gentleman's Magazine.’ He likewise received medals from the Society of Arts and the Bath Agricultural Society for inventing various machines. Samuel was sent to Marlborough free school, of which in 1783 he was head-boy. In 1784 he arrived in London, and studied medicine under his uncle, Dr. Samuel Merriman. After hearing the lectures of Matthew Baillie and William Cumberland Cruikshank at the Anatomical Theatre in Great Windmill Street he attended in 1795 the midwifery lectures of Dr. Thynne and the Westminster Lying-in Hospital, but his clinical knowledge of disease was principally obtained by seeing the numerous patients of his cousin William (1766–1800), son of the elder Samuel Merriman. In 1807, having become a member of the Society of Apothecaries, he entered into partnership with Mr. Peregrine, to whom he soon resigned the general practice, limiting himself to midwifery alone. In 1808 he was appointed physician-accoucheur to the Westminster General Dispensary, having previously received the honorary degree of M.D. from Marischal College, Aberdeen, for which he was specially examined in London by Dr. Vaughan (afterwards Sir Henry Halford). He resigned the office in 1815, and was appointed consulting physician-accoucheur and subsequently vice-president of the charity. On 17 August 1809 he was elected to the like office at the Middlesex Hospital, where in 1810 he commenced his annual course of lectures on midwifery, and continued them regularly till 1825. In 1822, when his consultation practice as a physician for the diseases of women and children had largely increased, he removed to Brook Street, Grosvenor Square, and he subsequently purchased an estate at Rodborne Cheney, Wiltshire. Merriman resigned his post at the Middlesex Hospital on 7 March 1826, but continued to take a warm interest in the institution, and was one of the treasurers from 1840 until 1845. Of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society he was elected treasurer in 1837.\nMerriman died in Brook Street on 22 November 1852. He married in 1799 Ann (1778–1831), only surviving daughter of his uncle, Samuel Merriman. Their children were two daughters and a son, Samuel William John Merriman, M.D. (1814–1873), consulting physician to the Westminster General Dispensary (1847), physician to the Royal Infirmary for Children (1849), and author of ‘Arguments against the Indiscriminate Use of Chloroform in Midwifery,’ 8vo, London, 1848, and other treatises.\nMerriman published in 1805 a pamphlet in vindication of vaccination entitled ‘Observations on some late Attempts to Depreciate the Value and Efficacy of Vaccine Inoculation.’ He had taken up his pen to prove the superior excellence of the smallpox inoculation, but as he wrote he found his arguments untenable. Essays and other papers of his were published in the ‘London Medical Repository,’ the ‘London Medical and Physical Journal,’ and the ‘Medico-Chirurgical Transactions,’ but the medical works for which he was best known were his ‘Synopsis of the Various Kinds of Difficult Parturition,’ 12mo, London, 1814, which passed through several editions, and was translated into Italian, German, and French, and his edition of Dr. M. Underwood's ‘Treatise on the Diseases of Children,’ 8vo, London, 1827. During his tenure of office as examiner to the Society of Apothecaries (1831–7) he published in 1833, under the title of ‘The Validity of “Thoughts on Medical Reform,”’ an answer to a pamphlet of that title written, as was understood, by John Allen, M.D. He also wrote a ‘Dissertation on the Retroversion of the Womb,’ 8vo, London, 1810.\nMerriman illustrated with anecdotes his copies of ‘A Picture of the College of Physicians’ and Wadd's ‘Nugæ Chirurgicæ.’ He had also a fine collection of portraits of medical men. Philological subjects much interested him. To the ‘Gentleman's Magazine’ and ‘Notes and Queries,’ then recently established, he contributed articles of real value. For the ‘London Journal of Medicine’ he wrote an historical retrospect of the science and practice of medicine under the title of ‘The First of October 1851, by an Octogenarian.’\nSeveral portraits of Merriman were taken at different periods, two of which only have been engraved—one a private plate.\nHis first cousin, John Merriman (1774–1839), surgeon, born on 26 Oct. 1774 at Marlborough, was son of Nathaniel Merriman by his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Baverstock of Alton, Hampshire. In 1794 he came to London to complete his medical education, and was admitted member of the Royal College of Surgeons and of the Society of Apothecaries. He soon became associated in business at Kensington with Thomas Hardwick, whose niece Jane, daughter of John Hardwick of Weston, Herefordshire, he married. For many years he was general medical attendant on the Duchess of Kent, the Princess Victoria, and the Princess Sophia, at Kensington Palace; accordingly the Princess Victoria, as soon as she ascended the throne, conferred upon him and his two sons, John (1800–1881) and James Nathaniel (1806–1854), all of whom were in partnership at Kensington, the appointment of apothecary extraordinary to her majesty. He died on 17 June 1839 at Kensington Square (Gent. Mag. 1839, pt. ii. p. 204). His portrait was engraved by Newton from a painting by Lucas.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Goodwin, Gordon (1894). \"Merriman, Samuel (1771-1852)\".

        "content": "Mystic Crucifixion is a c. 1500 oil on canvas and egg tempera painting by the Florentine Renaissance master Sandro Botticelli (c. 1445-1510) . Painted during the part of his career when he came under the influence of the Dominican friar Girolamo Savonarola (though after the cleric had already been burnt at the stake), the work has been seen as a statement upon the state of Florence itself.\nHere Botticelli depicts themes from the cleric's fiery missives. Therein \"Firebrands and weapons rain down from black storm clouds, and an angel of justice raises his sword to slay the marzocco, the small lion that is the emblem of Florence\".  A woman believed to be Mary Magdalene lays on the ground and wrapped around the cross, figuratively at Jesus Christ's feet. The shields of the angels in picture bear red crosses the symbol of the people  \nof Florence. The city of Florence can been aeen beyond, behind the crucifixion scene in tbe background.\nThe work is held in the permanent collection of the Harvard Art Museums.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Samuel Spode (1798–1872) was a British painter best known for his equestrian sporting scenes, specialising in the portraiture of sporting and military horses.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLittle is known about Samuel Spode's life. There are few sources and the information is sparse. Samuel Spode was born 21 April 1798. He was the grandson of Josiah Spode.\n\n\n=== Marriage and emigration ===\nOn 6 February 1821, Samuel Spode married Mary Crewe. It was the time, when the British Government encouraged adventurers to emigrate to the penal colony of Van Diemen's Land. And only a few weeks after their marriage, Samuel Spode and his wife, as well as his brother Josiah and his wife Maria Middlemore Garner, took their chance and tried their luck in Van Diemen's Land.\nIn Van Diemen's Land, Samuel Spode had briefly served as clerk of the colony's Supreme Court, after being trained as a lawyer by his uncle, Thomas Fenton, who was married to Josiah Spode's youngest daughter, Anne.\n\n\n=== Back in England ===\n\nWhile his brother and his wife remained in Van Diemen's Land, Samuel Spode and his family returned to England in 1826. When they returned to England, they stayed with his sister Sarah and her husband, the potter Charles James Mason (1791–1856), at their house Heron Cottage in the Staffordshire Potteries.\nWithin a year of their return to England, Spode's wife died. The cause of death may have been Acquired brain injury, which might have been the result of a carriage accident back in Van Diemen's land in April 1825. Spode remarried several times, since by the age of 40, he had been widowed three times.\n\n\n=== Samuel Spode's passion – painter of famous horses ===\n\nEven though Samuel Spode was able to make a living for a while with his legal training, he preferred to devote his time to painting. Painting was his passion, particularly animal painting, with a focus on horses.\nSamuel Spode loved equestrian sports. He painted many horse racing and fox hunting scenes. Spode also painted many famous racehorses, including Birdcatcher, Caractacus and Voltager, winner of both: the Derby and St Leger in 1850. Other prominent horses he portrayed were Copenhagen, the Duke of Wellington's war horse, which he most famously rode at the Battle of Waterloo, and Ronald, the charger, ridden by Lord Cardigan in the Charge of the Light Brigade in 1854.\nAt around 1845, Spode painted several paintings for patrons with Stonehenge in the background. It can therefore be assumed that he lived briefly at nearby Amesbury. The painting The Pinckney Family Coursing at Stonehenge is regarded as his most famous work from this period.\nSometimes his patrons liked to be included in the paintings too, like John Dawson Duckett of Duckett's Grove and the Earl of Lonsdale. In 1825, two of Samuel Spode's paintings were reproduced and published in The Sporting Magazine.\n\n\n=== Ireland: On the racecourse, marriage and death ===\nIn the 1830s, Samuel Spode travelled frequently to Ireland in search of commissions. However, he also worked as a horse trainer at the Curragh Racecourse for some time, as evidenced by a painting by Henry Samuel Alken Jnr (1810–1894), titled and dated S. Spode Training Eastern Bere / 1856.\nIn 1865, despite still being married to his fourth English wife, he claimed to be a bachelor and married an Irish girl named Delia in Dublin.\nSamuel Spode died in Dublin on 31 March 1872, leaving several children by several wives. Despite obviously still being married to the Irish girl, who was granted administration of his meagre estate, his death was registered by a Teresa Spode. Her connection to Samuel Spode has never been defined.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nSamuel Spode worked solely on commissions. Therefore, he never exhibited at any of the well-known exhibitions. As a result, he has been relatively unknown and unrecognised. However, his legacy is impressive, both in the number of paintings and the famous horses he depicted.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading (external links) ==\n in alphabetical order \n\nAdam's Auctioneers: Samuel Spode\nArt UK: The Pinckney Family Coursing at Stonehenge, by Samuel Spode\nBlackbrook Gallery: Samuel Spode\nSotheby's: Samuel Spode – Pembroke, a Thoroughbred Horse\nSotheby's: Henry Samuel Alken Jnr (1810–1894) – S.

        "content": "Samuel Merriman (29 December 1731 – 17 August 1818) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMerriman was born on 29 December 1731 at Marlborough, Wiltshire, was third son of Nathaniel Merriman, grocer there, by his wife Elizabeth Hawkes. Being intended for the medical profession he was sent to Edinburgh in 1748, and graduated there as M.D. in 1753, his thesis ‘De Conceptu,’ 8vo, Edinburgh, 1753, being of so much value that it was reprinted by William Smellie in the second volume of his ‘Thesaurus Medicus’ (1779). Merriman first settled as a physician in Bristol, and afterwards removed to Andover, Hampshire; but coming to London in April 1757, he commenced practice in Queen Street, Mayfair, as an apothecary or general practitioner, in partnership with Oakley Halford, who was about to retire. He remained an apothecary for about twenty years, when he acted on his diploma, and practised only as a physician, finally retiring in 1812. His speciality was midwifery. The number of labours which he attended amounted to rather more than ten thousand; in one year alone he attended 362. His leisure was devoted to literature and biblical studies.\nMerriman died at his son-in-law's house, 26 Half Moon Street, on 17 August 1818. In 1753 he married one of the daughters and coheiresses of William Dance, surgeon, of Marlborough, and by her, who died in 1780, he had fourteen children; of these one alone, Ann, wife of his nephew Samuel Merriman, survived him.\nThere is an excellent miniature of him painted by Richmond and engraved by Corner.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Goodwin, Gordon (1894). \"Merriman, Samuel (1731-1818)\".

        "content": "John Fuller (died 14 December 1825) was a Scottish surgeon and historian.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nFuller was a historian of Berwick-on-Tweed. He was some years in practice as a surgeon at Ayton, Berwickshire. During that time, in 1785, he published a pamphlet of ‘New Hints relating to Persons Drowned and apparently Dead’ (London, 8vo), in which he proposed transfusion from the carotid artery of a sheep as a means of resuscitation. It does not appear that the method was tried. On 21 November 1789 Fuller, who appears to have had no previous connection with the university, received his M.D. degree at St. Andrews upon testimonials from Messrs. N. and T. Spens, physicians, Edinburgh, Alexander Wood, surgeon, and Andrew Wardrop, physician (Minutes of the university). Afterwards he practised at Berwick. While there in 1794, soon after the formation of the board of agriculture, he addressed to the board suggestions for the collecting of health statistics from counties periodically, and for the formation of a central medical institution and of a national veterinary college. At the request of Sir John Sinclair, president of the board, he prepared in a small compass the account of Berwick for the ‘Statistical Account of Scotland;’ but as he suggested that it required more extended treatment Sinclair agreed to its publication as a separate work, entitled ‘History of Berwick’ (London, 1799), 4to, with plates. Fuller afterwards lived in Edinburgh. Sykes, the border historian, states that in 1824 Fuller issued prospectuses for a general view of the ‘Border History of England and Scotland,’ but that ‘the work was not published during his [Fuller's] lifetime.’ Fuller died at Edinburgh 14 December 1825.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Chichester, Henry Manners (1889). \"Fuller, John (d.1825)\".

Brandon said that the reason he founded Niche Gamer was to \"to bring original content, insightful opinions and the full and accurate news without any fluff or political agenda.\" Another writer for Niche Gamer is Brandon Lyttle who describes himself as \"A basement-dwelling ogre, who's fan of indie games and slice of life anime and has too many games and not enough time.\"\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n\n=== Plagiarism ===\nGaming news site Gematsu has accused Niche Gamer numerous times of \"very blatantly stealing content from Gematsu\". Niche Gamer's response to the accusations were that a \"ghostwriter\" was the one who plagiarised the content. On 19 December 2019, Niche Gamer owner and founder Brandon Orselli admitted that he lied about the ghostwriter and apologized to Gematsu. On 7 December 2022, Niche Gamer was once again caught plagerizing work from Gematsu Editor-in-Chief Sal Romano.\n\n\n=== Misinformation ===\nOn 16 August 2022, Niche Gamer writer Jonathan White wrote a hit piece article on a mod for the video game Spider-Man. The article claimed that the mod wasn't even a mod and that it simply changed the game from the American version to the Middle Eastern version. The article was later taken down after backlash.\nOn 11 November 2023, Niche Gamer wrote a hit piece article on CNN correspondent Hanako Montgomery who had previously worked for Vice News and wrote the controversial Emmy Award winning documentary \"Inside the Pedophilic Manga Industry in Japan\". The article claimed that the documentary \"slandered Japan’s freedom of expression, manga industry, and labeled its consumers child abusers\". The article called Hanako a \"hack-journalist\".\nOn 7 December 2023, Niche Gamer published an article claiming that Italy had just passed a law that classifies lolicon content as child pornography. They cited a Twitter user by the name of SlyPreformer who claimed that any anime artwork and fanart could be classified as child pornography under Italian law. However, the image that they posted was from a court case against a man convicted for the possession of explicit photos of minors. Furthermore, Italy has classified lolicon as child porography since February 2022.\nOn 12 December 2023, Niche Gamer published an article claiming that the song Idol by Yoasobi topped the song Try That in a Small Town by Jason Aldean as the Top Trending 2023 song. However, neither song was the top song of 2023. The song Flowers by Miley Cyrus was the top song of 2023. The song Idol also never topped the song Try That in a Small Town on any chart.\nOn 25 March 2024 Niche Gamer published an article claiming that American multinational corporation Microsoft made a set of rules to developers to avoid \"curvy female characters\". However no such set of rules were ever made and it was actually just a suggestion that Microsoft had made to help Video game developers.\nOn 28 March 2024, Niche Gamer founder Brandon Orselli wrote an article about the recently deceased Jewish-American Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman who had died at the age of 82 after compications from a fall. The article mocked Lieberman for his view on video games, ranted about the removal of the game Night Trap from store shelves and blamed Lieberman for the creation of the Entertainment Software Rating Board.\nOn 28 March 2024, Niche Gamer writer Brandon Lyttle wrote an article about claiming that the Japanese Communist Party was encouraging Japanese citizens to \"report fanservice manga\" to the UN. The article also had a section voicing support for Liberal Democratic Party member and manga artist Ken Akamatsu who notably wrote the manga Love Hina in 1998. However, the Japanese Communist Party has made no such statement.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Catholic Electoral Committee \"Fatherland\" (Polish: Katolicki Komitet Wyborczy \"Ojczyzna\", KKW or Ojczyzna) was a conservative and Christian democratic electoral alliance in Poland. It consisted of five parties - the Christian National Union (ZChN), Conservative Party (PK), Christian-Peasant Party (SLCh), Party of Christian Democrats (PChD) and the Federation of Polish Entrepreneurship (FPP).\nThe coalition was based on the Catholic Electoral Action that participated in the 1991 Polish parliamentary election. In contrast to the 1991 coalition, the Catholic Electoral Committee \"Fatherland\" downplayed national-Catholicism in favor of more moderate image, and tried to attract centre-right voters. It failed to gain support of the Catholic clergy and tried to develop support bases in parish councils instead. It ultimately failed to cross the 8% electoral threshold for coalitions and gained no seats. It greatly contributed to the fragmentation of centre-right parties in the 1993 election.\n\n\n== History ==\nCatholic Electoral Committee \"Fatherland\" was founded on the 13th of July 1993 in Gdańsk, brokered by the Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Gdańsk, Tadeusz Gocłowski, with the intentions of garnering the votes of the Roman Catholic faithful. The electoral coalition initially sought to expand by the Polish People's Party – Peasants' Agreement (PSL-PL), however, the Peasant's Agreement rejected joining the coalition due to their resentment of PK leader Aleksander Hall and SLCh leader Artur Balazs. The possibility of the Centre Agreement and Movement for the Republic joining the coalition were also proposed, but quickly dismissed.\nThe politicians of \"Ojczyzna\", including the SLCh, counted on the discreet support of the Catholic Church during the election campaign. However, contrary to Ojczyzna's expectations, the Roman Catholic clergy largely refused to endorse any political party in 1993 (though some explicitly condemned the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) - a notably anticlerical party), largely to the coalition's disadvantage, since, during the campaign, they were hoping to present themselves as defenders of the Catholic Church and protectors of the interests of Catholics.\nThe Catholic Church had no intention of getting involved in the election campaign. The Polish bishops drafted a pastoral letter that encouraged participation in the elections and stated in it that \"bishops and priests do not engage in public party-political discussions, do not stand for parliament and do not participate in the election campaign, but they point out the moral principles and criteria that, in accordance with the teachings of the Church, Catholics should follow when choosing their representatives.\"\nIn view of this, the coalition tried to attract Catholic voters without the overt support of the Church by defending the presence of religion in schools, the Concordat with the Holy See adopted at the end of July, and acting in the constitutional debate to guarantee mutual independence. Krzysztof Oksiuta, the head of the electoral staff of \"Ojczyzna\" and at the same time a politician of the SLCh, also claimed that the coalition received offers of cooperation from lay Catholics during the election campaign: \"Parish councils and other Church-related circles themselves are trying to reach us. They are looking for contacts, they come for leaflets. Priests ask us to come to a meeting, and in such cases candidates cooperate with priests\".\nIn the 1993 Polish parliamentary election, the only election the coalition contested, they secured 6.37% of all valid votes. Unlike many other contemporary and future coalitions seeking to bypass the electoral threshold by registering as a party (and thus only needing to acquire 5% of the vote to enter the Sejm), KKW registered as a coalition, and thereby failed to pass the 8% electoral threshold for electoral coalitions, gaining no seats. Their failure to pass the threshold contributed to the SLD's landslide victory in the election.\nThe coalition received abysmal support in urban areas, and had some support in the countryside instead. It contributed to the fragmentation of the centre-right in the 1993 election and was found to have cost fellow centre-right parties support and seats, which led to accusations of the Catholic Electoral Committee \"Fatherland\" being a spoiler party.\n\n\n== Ideology ==\nThe coalition was classified as centre-right. In contrast to the Catholic Electoral Action from 1991, the Catholic Electoral Committee \"Fatherland\" tried to downplay its national-Catholic image in favor of a more inclusive coalition.\nAmongst its main goals, the Catholic Electoral Committee \"Fatherland\" listed \"an efficient and democratic state\", the development of a market economy in Poland and respect for Catholic and patriotic values\". The main slogan of the committee was \"Poland first\" (Polish: Najpierw Polska). Clarifying the meaning of its slogan, the coalition stated: \"Our slogan is not directed against anyone, against any country. We stand for Poland as a general interest, and against group and class interests.\"\nOther slogans that were used in the election campaign were: \"Free enterprise and private property\" and \"State for the family\". Leaders of the coalition emphasised that a comprehensive programme was being presented, proposing solutions in the social and economic spheres. The committee defined itself as one that is \"not afraid of Christian values and want to be a force that clearly represents them\". The need to adhere to Catholic moral values was presented as not only the matter of social conservatism, but was also referred to in terms of anti-corruption.\nExplaining its economic slogan of \"free enterprise and private property\", the Catholic Electoral Committee \"Fatherland\" clarified that it envisions an economic policy aimed at \"fighting unemployment, recognition of agriculture and agrifood processing as a strategic direction of economic policy\" and proposed a \"tax system conducive to economic growth, investment allowances, accessible credit and a reduction in income tax\". Amongst the proposals of the party was also low-cost housing and special welfare programs for disabled people. During the campaign, the coalition summed up its economic goals as following:\n\nensuring a fair standard of living for the rural population;\nstabilizing agricultural markets;\nensuring affordable prices for the consumer;\nguaranteeing a steady supply of food to the domestic market;\nprotecting natural resources of the land, air, and water in order to produce 'healthy food'.\n\n\n== Electoral results ==\n\n\n=== Sejm ===\n\n\n== References ==",

The scouring of all agricultural counties continued. The pride of possessing slaves was lessening and the profit of selling them was increasing. With each year new traders came and some of the old were lost sight of. William Harker was a remarkable exception, for he was 'in the market' for a quarter of a century—1835–59, and he bought 'all likely negroes from 8 to 40 years of age'.\" \nAn 1852 newspaper advertisement placed by Harker caught the attention of Harriet Beecher Stowe, warranting comment in her non-fiction polemic A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin:\n\nNEGROES WANTED. I wish to inform the slave holders of Dorchester and the adjacent counties that I am again in the Market. Persons having negroes that are slaves for life to dispose of will find it to their interest to see me before they sell, as I am determined to pay the highest prices in cash that the Southern market will justify. I can be found at A. Hall's Hotel in Easton, where I will remain until the first day of July next. Communications addressed to me at Easton, or information given to Wm. Bell in Cambridge, will meet with prompt attention.\nWM. HARKER. \n\nMr. Harker is very accommodating. He keeps himself informed as to the state of the Southern market, and will give the very highest price that it will justify. Moreover, he will be on hand till July, and will answer any letters from the adjoining country on the subject. On one point he ought to be spoken to. He has not advertised that he does not separate families. It is a mere matter of taste, to be sure; but then, some well-disposed people like to see it on a trader's card, thinking it has a more creditable appear- ance; and, probably, Mr. Harker, if he reflects a little, will put it in next time. It takes up very little room, and makes a good appearance. \nResearch into the history of the slave trade in Baltimore has found that Harker had an office on South Calvert Street near the intersection with Baltimore Street.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of American slave traders\nHistory of slavery in Maryland\nSlave markets and slave jails in the United States\nBibliography of the slave trade in the United States\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nBancroft, Frederic (2023) [1931, 1996].

        "content": "The Corinth rail disaster occurred on 30 September 1968 when, Two passenger trains carrying people returning to Athens after voting in their home towns in the constitutional referendum of 1968 which had been held the previous day collided near Derveni, Corinth, killing 34 people and injuring 150. It was the worst railway disaster the country had experienced up to that time.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe regime of the Aprilians had organized a mock referendum for the approval of a new Constitution and all of Greece had gone to the polls. \nOn the afternoon of Monday 30 September two passenger trains one and a half hours apart left Kyparissia in Messinia bound for Athens and Piraeus. In the carriages of both train there were almost 2,500 passengers citizens, returning from voting in the referendum on the Constitution of Greece, which had been carried out by the Junta. The two trains had started their journey an hour and a half apart, the first being Regional express (stopping at all stations) while the second an Intercity service (stopping only at major stations). At 15.15 the first train, 304, left Patras.The second train, 306, started from Patras at 16.24, as an express services (stopping only at major stations) the distance between both services decreased quickly on the signal track line. \n\n\n== Collision ==\nTrain \"304\" after parking at the station of Derveni and picking up passengers, continued its route, but stopped a few meters below. It was then said that someone had pulled the emergency lever. Even today it is not known why it happened and who did it. \nThe train crew after stopping came down to see what had happened while one of them placed a warning signal at the back of the train so that the train driver of the following train would be informed in time.\nThe second train, the \"High Speed\", which made stops only at central stations, passed Derveni station without stopping. The \"Peloponnisos\" newspaper wrote (at the time) the railway employees had caught the conversation and one train, 306, was moving at a speed of more than 50 kilometers. No one saw the warning sign that had been posted. By the time the drivers of 306 noticed the stalled train number 304, it was too late. They tried to stop the train but failed. At 18.50 Engine 306 collided into the last car of Train 304, which was reduced to a shapeless mass of metal, while three more cars were derailed. Passengers who had survived, but let injured screamed for help.\nThe by Village of Derveni was made aware of the collision by the big \"bang\". with residents rushing to the scene to see what had happened.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nImmediately after, soldiers from the School of Engineering in Loutraki, police officers and nurses arrived at the scene. The tragic toll of the accident was 34 dead and more than 150 injured. According to a publication of the time in the \"Peloponnisos\" newspaper, the handling of the high-speed train was undertaken by a train driver who had boarded in Patras and was licensed that day. The same publication had revealed that the four train drivers had caught up in a conversation while the train was moving and this resulted in them not seeing the warning signal for the stationary train in time.\nIn the weeks following the crash press speculation over why the Emergency brake was pulled, and by whom. A sailor fainted and a panicked woman pulled the distress signal. An elderly woman fainted and a passenger pulled the emergency handle. A pregnant woman fainted due to overcrowding and a sailor caused the train to stop.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of rail accidents\nList of rail accidents by country\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nSemmens, Peter (1994).

        "content": "Hugh Downman (1740 – 23 September 1809) was an English physician, poet and dramatist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nDownman was the son of Hugh Downman of Newton House, Newton St. Cyres, Exeter. He was educated at the Exeter grammar school. He entered Balliol College, Oxford, 1758, proceeded B.A. 1763, and was ordained in Exeter Cathedral the same year. His clerical prospects being very small, he went to Edinburgh to study medicine, and boarded with Thomas Blacklock. In 1768 he published ‘The Land of the Muses; a poem in the manner of Spenser, by H. D.’ In 1769 he visited London for hospital practice, and in 1770, after proceeding M.A. at Jesus College, Cambridge, he practised medicine at Exeter, where he married the daughter of Dr. Andrew. A chronic complaint in 1778 compelled him to retire for a time. His best-known poem, ‘ Infancy, or the Management of Children,’ was published in three separate parts: i. 1774, ii. 1775, iii. 1776, London, 4to. A seventh edition was issued in 1809. In 1775 appeared ‘The Drama,’ London, 4to; ‘An Elegy written under a Gallows,’ London, 4to; and ‘The Soliloquy,’ Edinburgh, 4to. During his retirement he also published ‘Lucius Junius Brutus,’ five acts, London, 1779 (not performed); ‘Belisarius,’ played in Exeter theatre for a few nights; and ‘Editha, a Tragedy,’ Exeter, 1784—founded on a local incident, and performed for sixteen nights. These plays appeared in one volume as ‘Tragedies, by H. D., M.D.,’ Exeter, 1792, 8vo. He also published ‘Poems to Thespia,’ Exeter, 1781, 8vo, and ‘The Death Song of Ragnar Lodbrach,’ translated from the Latin of Olaus Wormius, London, 1781, 4to. He was one of the translators of an edition of Voltaire's works in English, London, 8vo, 1781. In 1791 he published ‘Poems,’ second edition, London, 8vo, comprising the ‘Land of the Muses’ (with a second version) and ‘Ragnar Lodbrach.’ He was also contributor to Richard Polwhele's ‘Collections of the Poetry of Devon and Cornwall.’\nDownman seems to have resumed medical practice at Exeter about 1790, and in 1796 he founded there a literary society of twelve members. A volume of the essays was printed, and a second volume is said to exist in manuscript. Downman wrote the opening address, and essays on ‘Serpent Worship,’ on the ‘Shields of Hercules and Achilles,’ and on ‘Pindar,’ with a translation of the 11th Pythian and 2nd Isthmian odes. In 1805 Downman finally relinquished his practice on account of ill-health. In 1808 the literary society was discontinued. On 23 September 1809 he died at Alphington, near Exeter, with the reputation of an able and humane physician and a most amiable man. Two years before he died an anonymous editor collected and published the various critical opinions and complimentary verses on his poems, Isaac D'Israeli's (1792) being among them.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Gibson, John Westby (1888). \"Downman, Hugh\".

        "content": "Pugad Island is a small densely populated island situated in Manila Bay and at the mouth of the Angat  – Pampanga River Delta. The island is part of the municipality of Hagonoy, Bulacan. Once, mangrove forests and marshes were proximate in the area and then over time people converted them into fish ponds, which they utilize today in cultivating aquatic organisms such as clams, whiting fish and mussels. According to the latest national census, the island has a population of 1,636.   \n\n\n== Natural Hazards and Disasters ==\nSituated in the overlap of two major river systems, flooding has become a norm especially during monsoon season.  Flood waters submerge the island during high tide and when heavy rainfall brought by typhoons, which causes the dams upstream to spill excess water. In 2023, three tropical cyclones resulted to major flooding in Pugad Island and in low-lying areas in Central Luzon. \nThe frequent occurrence of flooding in the area are linked to urban and population expansion in the area, the decreasing area of mangrove forests, which buffered the island from tides and the threat of rising sea levels due to the melting of the ice sheets and climate change. \nA study by the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, in partnership with the Ateneo de Manila University and the University of Santo Tomas presents various factors that hinder community resilience in small island communities in the Philippines, which includes limited resources and inadequate policies for the implementation of community-based disaster risk reduction and management. The findings of the report are gathered primarily from the responses and experiences of community leaders and residents of Pugad Island.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of islands by population density\n\n\n== References ==",

Porter in 1942, for the United States Transportation Corps. (USATC), originally No. 5001, she served in the Army depot in Tracy, California.\n\n\n=== Industrial service ===\nAfter World War II, in 1947, No. 5001 was sold to the Granite Rock Company of Watsonville, California and given the number 10. The locomotive worked at the company's A.R. Wilson quarry in Aromas, California until the 1950s, when it was replaced by diesel locomotives and taken out of service.\n\n\n=== Preservation ===\nNo. 10 stayed in Granite Rock's yards, until Bruce Woolpert the president and CEO, started a restoration effort in 1988 The work was undertaken at the shops of the California State Railroad Museum. The company donated No. 10 to the museum in 1997. The restoration work included a new boiler built by the Dixon Boilerworks, in Los Angeles. The locomotive was fully restored to operating condition by May 1997, and became the principle motive power of the museum's Sacramento Southern Railroad excursion railroad.\nOn 29 August 1997, No. 10 was operated by an all-female crew to mark the anniversary of the ratification of the 19th. Amendment.\nIn 2010, No.10 was loaned to the Niles Canyon Railway for their steam festival. The following year, No. 10 was taken out of service for extensive boiler repairs, before returning in April 11, 2015.\nAs of 2024, No. 10 is still out of order as the museum is fixing some cylinder issues and reworking the valve bushings.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Elk River Mill & Lumber Co. \"Falk\" No.1 is a 0-4-0 steam locomotive built by Marshutz and Centrell in 1884. This \"gypsy\" type locomotive was purchased by Noah Falk in San Francisco and shipped by vessel to Arcata, CA. It was first used at the Dolly Varden Mill in north Arcata until the mill was closed in 1885. In 1886, it was moved to Falk, California, for use on the Elk River Mill & Lumber Co. railroad. Logs were hauled from the woods to the mill. When the railroad was extended five miles up a narrow, winding canyon, a larger locomotive was purchased in 1903. The Falk was relegated to switching duties at the mill. In 1927 it was retired. The locomotive was given to the city of Eureka, California, for use in a 1936 Fourth of July parade operating on streetcar tracks. \n\nIn May 1986, the engine participated at SteamExpo 86 in Vancouver, British Columbia along with V&T 22 Inyo, CP 374, CP 3, Dunrobin (2nd), PL Co. 12, GW 51, AP 2, CN 1392, UP 4466, HL Co.

The engine participated at Railfair 1999, along with Eureka (locomotive), BHL Co. 1, SCLL 4 Denna, F&W Co. 1 Sespe, ML Co. 1, MSVR 3, JK&Co. Gwen, SERA 28, PM Co. 1, MEL Co. 1, GCRR 1925, H. RY.

Stanford, C. P. Huntington, V&T 13 Empire, V&T 12 Genoa, NPC 12 Sonoma, NSL 1, AT&SF 1010, NWP 112, UP 4466, GR Co. 10, SP 4294, AT&SF 2925, and AT&SF 5021 live. SP 1233 had to pull a mixed freight train. UP 4466 did a last year run before being retired and put back on display. The shay locomotives were having the great shay race. Everything went well, until UP 844 had suffered a boiler tube failure, UP 3985 had to take UP 844 home dead in tow back to Cheyenne, Wyoming for an overhaul restoration into operating condition. As of 2024, The Falk is still operational.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Leve Palestina (Swedish for \"Long Live Palestine\") is a 1978 protest song by the Swedish-Palestinian musician George Totari and Swedish band Kofia. A popular song at socialist protests since its 1970s release, it has gone viral since the onset of 2023 Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\n== History ==\nOriginating in the 1970s, Leve Palestina was created as a protest song by the band Kofia, founded by George Totari, a Swedish-Palestinian musician born in Nazareth who moved to Sweden in 1967. It was released as the last song of the 1978 album Earth of My Homeland, and has subsequently become Kofia's best-known work.\nTotari formed Kofia (Swedish for keffiyeh) in Gothenburg and wrote the song Leve Palestina in response to the limitations on openly criticizing Israel and denial of Palestinian identity in the country at the time. The lyrics of Leve Palestina depict the harvesting of wheat and olives in Palestine and the throwing of rocks and firing of rockets at her enemies. The song invokes the socialist struggle against imperialism, calling for the downfall of Zionism and liberation of Palestine.\nThe song has been regularly chanted at demonstrations in Sweden since it was written in the 1970s, and has been censured by the Swedish authorities. On the International Workers Day in 2019, pro-Palestinian activists sang Leve Palestina at a demonstration in Malmö, drawing condemnation by both right-wing press and the ruling Social Democratic Party. The youth wing of the Social Democratic Party was also reported to the police for singing the song, and accused of hate speech. It subsequently agreed not to sing the song.\n\n\n== 2023 revival ==\nIn the wake of the 2023 Israel-Hamas war, invasion of Gaza and Gaza Strip famine, the song has seen a major revival, spreading through platforms like TikTok and Instagram and becoming a rallying anthem at protests for the Palestinian cause across Europe.\nThe song's viral spread began with a 30-second clip of an October 2023 protest in Stockholm that one Swedish TikToker then set to the music of Leve Palestina. That video has now been viewed five million times. The song has now been heard at protests from Jakarta to Madrid, and has been translated into languages including English, Hindi and Indonesian.\nIn the six months since the revival of Leve Palestina in October 2023, the song has drawn renewed criticism from the Swedish government. Despite calls from Sweden's ruling party to ban or censor the song, and the direction of the police to disrupt its performance, \"Leve Palestina\" continues to be sung at Swedish rallies – events where the thousands of attendees have made police action impractical.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Robert Dickson (1804 – 13 October 1875) was a Scottish physician and botanist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nDickson was born at Dumfries in 1804, and educated at the high school and the university of Edinburgh, where he graduated M.D. in 1826. Having settled in London, he became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1855, and continued to practise there till 1866, when he retired to the country. He was an accomplished botanist, and lectured on botany at the medical school in Webb Street, and afterwards at St. George's Hospital. All the articles on ‘Materia Medica’ in the Penny Cyclopædia were by him, and he also published several articles on popular science in the ‘Church of England Magazine.’ He died on 13 October 1875. In 1834 he married Mary Ann Coope, who also died in 1875. There were six surviving children.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Dixon, James (1888). \"Dickson, Robert\".

        "content": "The Cretan expedition occurred between 911 and 912, when the Byzantine army invaded the island of Crete to recapture it, which was held by the Arabs. The expedition ended in failure for the Byzantine army.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter Arabs from Andalusia took over Crete in 824, it developed into the Arab Emirate of Crete and a base for corsairs that pillaged Byzantium's coastline. Without success, the Empire attempted to retake Crete several times. Emperor Leo VI chose the patrician Himerios to lead a new campaign against Crete in the 910s. The Byzantine navy had 177 and consisted of 34,200 oarsmen, 7140 soldiers, 700 Rus, and 5089 Mardaite merecenaries.\n\n\n== Expedition ==\nThe expedition set sail from Constantinople on October, 911. The Byzantine landed and besieged the city of Chandax, the capital of the Arabs in Crete. The Byzantines faced difficulties during the siege. The walls of Chandax were heavily fortified and large moat was established along with the stiff resistance by the garrison. In addition to supply problems due to the large number of soldiers in the campaign, the Byzantines were constantly harassed by the Arabs outside of Chandax. The siege lasted for six months.\nNews soon reached Himerios that the emperor's health was declining, prompting him to raise the siege and return to the capital. On April, 912, the fleet sailed home and arriving at the island of Chios, he was ambushed by an Arab navy led by Leo of Tripoli and Damian of Tarsus. The Cretans pursued the Byzantines and joined with their allies in destroying the Byzantine fleet. Himerios escaped the destruction.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nShaun Tougher (1997), The Reign of Leo VI (886–912): Politics and People.[1]\nJohn Carr (2015), Fighting Emperors of Byzantium.[2]\nJohn Julius Norwich (1998), A Short History of Byzantium.[3]\nRomilly James Heald Jenkins (1970), Studies on Byzantine History of the 9th and 10th Centuries.[4]\nChristos Makrypoulias (2000), Byzantine Expeditions against the Emirate of Crete c.825-949.[5]",

        "content": "Emma Frances Camp (born 1987) is an English Australian marine biologist, Coral Expert, and National Geographic Explorer who researches the mechanisms of stress tolerance in corals. She is the Team Leader of the Future Reefs Team at the University of Technology Sydney. She is also the co-founder and lead scientist of Coral Nurture Program. In addition to her research, she promotes the retention of females in STEM fields.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nEmma was born in 1987 in Essex, England. She is a dual British and Australian citizen. She completed her schooling at St Martins secondary school, where she captained the women's Basketball team to win the National Championship. Emma played professional basketball in their pre-science career, representing England and Great Britain at the youth levels. She was the captain of Essex Blades team.In 2004, she received her first full international cap against Iceland. Emma attended Belmont Abbey College in Belmont, North Carolina, where she was awarded a BSc (Hons) and received a sports scholarship. She graduated with an Honours degree in Environmental science and chemistry.In 2011, She attended Sheffield Hallam University, where she studied her MSc in Environmental Management and Business. During this time, she played for Sheffield Hatters Basketball club.In 2013, Emma's science career began as she took up a science position at the Central Caribbean Marine Institute in the Cayman Islands. At the same time, she started a PhD at the University of Essex in Marine biology. Her thesis explored the biogeochemical series of reef-associated habitats on coral reefs. In 2014, Emma returned to England and took up a sports scholarship at the University of Essex for women's Basketball while she completed her Ph.D.. Emma captured the team to win the national championship by 1 point with under 2 seconds left. The University of Essex retired #14 Jersey in honor of Emma's efforts and leadership.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn early 2016, Emma Camp was awarded an Endeavour fellowship, and she moved to the University of Technology Sydney to focus on research full-time. Her research continued exploring reef-associated systems, such as Mangrove lagoons, to look for corals living in hostile environmental conditions, called Super corals. These natural laboratories have been a focus of Emma's research ever since.Emma is a National Geographic Explorer. In 2019, Emma's research efforts saw her named a Young Leader for the Sustainable Development Goals by the United Nations. Her research has evolved to consider metabolic interactions between corals and their symbiotic partners and how novel phenotyping tools can be used to select more tolerant corals for reef restoration.In 2018, Emma co-founded the Coral Nurture Program, a tourism-science site stewardship program on the Goat Barrier Reef. She remains the lead scientist for the Coral Nurture Program. In 2023, she moved to the role of Team Leader of the future Reefs Team at the University of Technology Sydney. The Future Reefs team unites coral Eco physiologists, molecular scientists, biologists, and analytical chemists to study how environmental change shapes coral fitness and survival. The team's research ranges from organism-scale molecular signatures to broad-scale ecological interactions, and specialize in advancing technical solutions to support innovative scientific capacity.Emma broadly supports other organizations working in Marine Conservation, including being a scientific advisor for SeaLegacy and an Ambassador for Coral catch. Alongside her research she advocates for the retention of females in STEM and was named an Inaugural STEM game changer by the Australian Academy of Science. She is also an active science communicator, passionate about communicating her research to the public, starring in several documentaries, including the BCC National Geographic film Perpetual Planet Heroes of the Ocean.\n\n\n== Documentary ==\nPerpetual Planet: Heroes of the Oceans 2021 on NAT GEO TV\n\n\n== Notable publications ==\n'Rapid coral decay is associated with marine heatwave mortality events on reefs', 2019, Vol:19, Cited by 155, William P Leggat, Emma F Camp, David J Suggett, Scott F Heron, Alexander J Fordyce, Stephanie Gardner, Lachlan Deakin, Michael Turner, Levi J Beeching, Unnikrishnan Kuzhiumparambil, C Mark Eakin, Tracy D Ainsworth\n'The Future of Coral Reefs Subject to Rapid Climate Change: Lessons from Natural Extreme Environments', 2018, vol:5, Cited by 228, DJ Suggett EF Camp, V Schoepf, PJ Mumby, LA Hardtke, R Rodolfo-Metalpa, DJ Smith\n'Reef-building corals thrive within hot-acidified and deoxygenated waters', 2017, Vol:7, cited by 113, pages: 2434, Emma F Camp, Matthew R Nitschke, Riccardo Rodolfo-Metalpa, Fanny Houlbreque, Stephanie G Gardner, David J Smith, Marco Zampighi, David J Suggett\n'Influence of conservation education dive briefings as a management tool on the timing and nature of recreational SCUBA diving impacts on coral reefs', 2012, Vol:61, pages:30-37, Cited by 132, Emma Camp, Douglas Fraser\n'The other microeukaryotes of the coral reef microbiome', 2017, Vol:25, cited by 89, TD Ainsworth, AJ Fordyce, EF Camp\n\n\n== Awards ==\nEmma has received or been shortlisted for various notable awards.\n\nWomen of Discovery Awards 2023\nNamed on the 2022 Coral Champion List by Lewis Pugh Foundation\nEmma received Rolex Awards for Enterprise in 2019.

        "content": "Denbigh Hall railway bridge carries the West Coast Main Line railway across Watling Street just north of Bletchley, Milton Keynes, in southern England. It dates from the opening of the London and Birmingham Railway in 1838 and was designed by Robert Stephenson though it has been heavily modified. It is a Grade II listed building.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe bridge is of an unusual design. It is an acutely skewed, cast-iron arch. The deck girders are at right angles to the track. It has a width of 165 feet (50 metres) and a square plan of 26 feet 9 inches (8.15 metres) between broad buttress walls in brick with stone abutments. The original curved cast-iron girders were replaced with straight ones when the line was quadruple-tracked in 1892 and again in 1946, the second time with reinforced concrete beams. The decorative ironwork, including the latticed parapet over the road, was preserved. The alterations and surviving original parts demonstrate all four construction techniques for such bridges developed during the bridge's lifetime.\n\n\n== History ==\nRobert Stephenson, the chief engineer of the London and Birmingham Railway surveyed the route and designed the bridge. The bridge crosses Watling Street, an historical route north-west from London, at Denbigh Hall. The area is now an industrial zone on the outskirts of Milton Keynes but in the 1830s was largely open land with an inn which served as a stopping point for stagecoaches on the Holyhead Road. The road was part of Thomas Telford's A5 road when the bridge was built but has since been bypassed. The London and Birmingham Railway opened in April 1838 but construction difficulties at Kilsby Tunnel to the north meant the line could not open as a through route. For the first five months, trains from London terminated at Denbigh Hall station, adjacent to the bridge; passengers were transferred to stagecoaches which took them to Rugby, where they resumed their journeys by train. The full route opened in September 1838 and the station closed. A plaque on the south-east side of the bridge records the temporary station's role.\nThe bridge was designated a Grade II listed building in 1975. Listed status provides legal protection against unauthorised modification or demolition and recognises structures of historical or architectural interest.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBiddle, Gordon (2011).

Tashjian ran for re-election in 1990 but was defeated by Republican nominee Pauline R. Kezer. Tashjian was accused of benefiting from having her name next to state comptroller and gubernatorial candidate Bill Curry on the ballot, who exceeded expectations in the Democratic primary. Tashjian dismissed these claims, saying \"Maybe Bill Curry benefitted a little bit from me. I went out there and met the voters.\"\nRapoport declared victory around 11:30 pm Tuesday night while Tashjian initially refused to concede the close race.\n\n\n== Third-party candidates and independent candidates ==\n\n\n=== A Connecticut Party ===\nA Connecticut Party endorsed Rapoport, giving him access to an additional ballot line.

        "content": "Thurso Pentland Football Club is a football club from Thurso in Caithness, Scotland.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe club was founded in 1918, originally under the name Pentland, by local men on leave from the First World War, who played ad hoc against Royal Navy sides and decided to stay together as a single club.\nPentland was generally the strongest side in the area up until the Second World War, the Caithness & Sutherland representative side always having a Pentland player in its XI until March 1939.  Indeed, the Pentland outside-left in 1938, Roy Manson, was so impressive in an inter-county match that he was signed up by Aberdeen.\nThe club joined the Scottish Football Association as a senior club in 1934.  It remained a member until the War, playing in the Scottish Qualifying Cup from 1934–35 to 1938–39, without winning a tie, but never being disgraced; in its final entry, it drew twice with Brora Rangers before going out at the third time of asking, Brora having won the toss to host the second replay.  The original replay ended 4–4; the Rangers' Miller scored a hat-trick in seven first-half minutes, two from the penalty spot, and Thurso came back from 4–2 down at half-time.  Pentland had been drawn to visit Ross County in the first round in 1939–40, but the competition was called off before the match could take place.\nThe Qualifying Cup was the only senior competition the club was able to enter - an attempt to join the North of Scotland Cup in 1938 was rejected because of distance.\nThe club currently plays in the Caithness Amateur Football Association league.  Its main honours have come in the Highland Amateur Cup, reaching five of the first six finals, and winning the competition three times, the first in 1979–80 with a 5–2 win over Dingwall Thistle at Dudgeon Park.\n\n\n== Colours ==\nThe club's colours are green and black.  Its change kit for 2023–24 is all black.\n\n\n== Ground ==\nThe club plays at St George's Park, also known as The Dammies.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nScottish AFA details",

        "content": "Gideon Delaune (1565?–1659) was a French Huguenot apothecary.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nDelaune was the eldest son of William Delaune, a French Protestant pastor. He was born at Rheims in or about 1565. He accompanied his father to England, and was appointed apothecary to Anne of Denmark, queen of James I. When that monarch determined in 1617 to incorporate the Society of Apothecaries, 114 apothecaries, being his majesty's ‘natural subjects,’ were nominated as members. With them a few foreigners were associated, and Delaune became a member of the court of assistants. He served the office of junior warden in 1624, that of senior warden in 1627, and was master in 1637. He was appointed an alderman of Dowgate Ward 17 January 1625–6, and was discharged as an alien a week later. Thomas Delaune (Present State of London, ed. 1681, p. 329), in an account of the Apothecaries' Company, says: ‘Among many worthy members [was] Dr. Gideon de Laune, apothecary to King James, a man noted for many singularities in his time, a great benefactor to the public, and particularly to the foundation of the Apothecaries' Hall in Black-Fryars, where his statue in white marble is to be seen to this day, and to whom I have the honour to be nearly related, which is not the reason that I mention him, but to perpetuate his memory as well as others, as is due to his desert. He lived piously to the age of ninety-seven years, and worth (notwithstanding his many acts of publick and private charity) near as many thousand pounds as he was years, having thirty-seven children by one wife, and about sixty grandchildren at his funeral. His famous pill is in great request to this day, notwithstanding the swarms of pretenders to pill-making.’ This account is in some respects erroneous. He had only seventeen children, most of whom were stillborn or died in infancy, and his grandchildren were fewer than thirty in number. These facts are proved by his will, dated 19 June 1654, and proved 20 June 1659, and by his funeral certificate in the College of Arms, both of which documents give his age as ninety-four at the time of his death.\nHe was a great benefactor to the Apothecaries' Company, having been ‘a principal means for the procuring of the said company to be made a corporation,’ and for the purchase of Apothecaries' Hall, where a massive marble bust of him is preserved. For many years this bust occupied such a position as to be virtually excluded from sight; but in 1846 it was placed on a bracket at the upper end of the hall. There is also in the hall a portrait of him in oil, supposed to have been painted by Cornelius Johnson. He possessed an estate at Roxton, Bedfordshire, the manor of Sharsted, Kent, where some of his descendants still resided as of the 19th century, a mansion in Blackfriars, London, and extensive property in Virginia and the Bermudas.\nBy his wife, Judith Chamberlaine, he had a son Abraham, who married Anne, daughter of Sir Richard Sandys of Northbourne Court, Kent; and a daughter, Anne, married to Sir Richard Sprignell, bart., of Coppenthorpe, Yorkshire.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Cooper, Thompson (1888). \"Delaune, Gideon\".

        "content": "Benoît Rayski (19 February 1938 – 20 March 2024) was a French journalist and essayist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in Paris on 19 February 1938, Benoît Rayski was the son of Adam Rayski, leader of the Jewish section of the FTP-MOI, a clandestine movement of the French Communist Party within the French Resistance. Benoît published approximately a dozen essays on the history of communism in the Resistance, notably L'Enfant juif et l’enfant ukrainien : réflexions sur une imposture and Le cadavre était trop grand. L'Affiche rouge, the latter of which discussed the Affiche Rouge and those who were sentenced to death for their participation.\nIn his earlier career, Rayski worked for France-Soir, L'Événement du jeudi, Le Matin de Paris, and Globe Hebdo. However, he later began writing for right-wing sources, such as Boulevard Voltaire and Riposte laïque, as well as others such as Atlantico and Causeur.\nIn October 2015, Rayski published an article in Atlantico discussing the reissue of Mein Kampf, which he claimed was a \"bestseller in the Arab-Muslim world\". The following month, Acrimed included him in an article dedicated to \"hawkish editorialists\", mentioning his claims to be a \"left-wing Islamophobe\" and a \"right-wing Islamophobe\". In 2016, he published a racially-charged article in Atlantico attacking Sihame Assbague, with a portion of his article stating: \"I don't want to be mixed with thousands of Sihame Assbagues who spit on me. Me being happy in my garden. Lounging in my hammock. Me smoking cigar. Me reading Tintin in the Congo. Me dreaming of being in a palanquin carried by black people.\" In 2017, he commented on the erotic essays and novels of Marlene Schiappa, whom he called the \"queen of sluts\", provoking reactions from internet users. Two days later, Atlantico issued an apology letter from Rayski to Schiappa. The website's publishing director, Jean-Sébastien Ferjou, declared the comments \"unjustifiable and inappropriate\".\nBenoît Rayski died on 20 March 2024, at the age of 86.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nL'Enfant juif et l’enfant ukrainien (2001)\nUn livre rouge (2002)\nCes étoiles qui brûlent en moi (2003)\nJours tranquilles à Créteil : Voyage au bout d'une haine ordinaire (2004)\nLà où vont les cigognes : récit (2007)\nLe cadavre était trop grand : Guy Môquet piétiné par le conformisme de gauche (2008)\nL’Affiche rouge – 21 février 1944 (2009)\nL’homme que vous aimez haïr (2010)\nJ'ai pour la France une étrange passion : Itinéraire amoureux (2012)\nL'antisémitisme peut-il être de gauche (2013)\nLe Gauchisme, maladie sénile du communisme (2013)\nStèle pour le sous-lieutenant Grunberg : Lycéen et résistant guillotiné par Pétain (2014)\nComment je suis devenu un sale Français : bref itinéraire d'un Juif polonais né en France (2015)\nFils d'Adam, Nostalgies communistes (2017)\nLes bâtards de Sartre (2018)\nLes effacés de la terre : quelques jours dans la vie de Julie (2019)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "William Delaune (died 1610) was a French Huguenot physician and minister.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nDelaune was a native of France, where he became a Protestant minister. He also studied medicine for eight years at Paris and Montpelier under Duretus and Rondeletius. Being obliged to leave his country on account of religion, he came to England, and on 7 December 1582 he was summoned before the College of Physicians for practising medicine in London without a license. As he stated many extenuating circumstances, the consideration of his case was postponed, and on the 22nd of the same month he was admitted a licentiate of the college. He practised chiefly in London, but was living in the university of Cambridge in 1583. He was buried at St. Anne's, Blackfriars, on 19 February 1610. His eldest son, Gideon Delaune, became the king's apothecary.\nHe was the author of ‘Institutionis Christianæ Religionis a Joanne Calvino conscriptæ Epitome. In qua adversariorum objectionibus responsiones annotantur,’ London, 1583, 1584, 8vo. Dedicated to Sir Richard Martin, master of the mint and alderman of London. An English translation by Christopher Fetherstone, minister of the word of God, appeared at Edinburgh about 1585, 8vo.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Cooper, Thompson (1888). \"Delaune, William (d.1610)\".

It is a remake of 2015 French film Blind Date based on an original story by Lilou Fogli.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nUpon moving to a new apartment, pianist Valentina clashes with her next-wall neighbor and game developer David as she makes too much noise and reclusive and sullen David requires silence for his work. But they will find a compromise and love will find a way.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nOriginally known under the working title Tras la pared (transl. 'Behind the wall') and written by Marta Sánchez, the film is a remake of the 2015 French comedy film Un peu, beaucoup, aveuglément!, aka Blind Date. The film is a Tripictures, Second Gen Pictures, and Blind Date Productions production. Filming began in May 2022. Shooting locations included La Latina (Madrid). The film was later renamed to Pared con pared (transl. 'Wall to wall').\n\n\n== Release ==\nLove, Divided was released on Netflix on 12 April 2024.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAmerican review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports a 60% approval rating based on 5 reviews from critics with an average score of 5.4/10.\nDesirée de Fez of El Periódico de Catalunya rated the film 3 out of 5 stars, writing that while \"the plot development is predictable and the dialogues are often embarrassing\", the premise has \"charm\", Font's direction is \"more than correct\", and Aitana underpins the film \"with no apparent difficulty\".\nLiz Kocan of Decider.com gave the film a positive recommendation deeming it to be \"a hidden gem, a romantic fantasy that's broad and appealing, not too heavy on the farce or mistaken identities, and hits just the right notes\".\nJavier Cazallas of HobbyConsolas scored the film with 73 points ('good') considering it \"a charming, simple romantic comedy\".\nEnid Román Almansa rated the film 3 out of 5 stars, deeming it to be \"a small step for Aitana, a large success for Netflix\" in the verdict.\nBeatriz Martínez of Infobae deemed the film to be a \"prefabricated product whose only enticement is the appearance of a centennial star who does not know how to act\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Spanish films of 2024\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External Links ==\nLove, Divided at IMDb",

The whorls are flattened, the spire is  subscalar, the apex is very blunt, the smallish aperture is pear-shaped and there is a very slight tooth on the columella.\nSculpture: Longitudinals:  there are very faint hair-like lines of growth. Spirals:  there are on the body whorl about 20, on the penultimate whorl about 8 rather strong and equal furrows stippled with roundish oval pits. They become more crowded and weaker toward the middle of the base. Just below the suture the\nfirst furrow is minutely and slightly beaded, and it with the next one or two is strong and these are crowded. The flat surface which parts them is somewhat broader than the furrows.\nThe color of the shell is translucent and subglossy white.\nThe spire is conical, high and scarcely scalar. The apex is blunt and truncated. The extreme tip is a very little inverted. The shell contains five whorls, very slightly shouldered just below the suture. Round the top there is a very feeble constriction. Below this the whorl is conical, and in profile flat on the sides. The body whorl is a very little tumid with a produced base. The suture is very little oblique, strongish and well marked, but not channelled. The aperture is pear-shaped, pointed above, a little oblique in direction, patulous or very slightly guttered in front of the columellar point. The outer lip is straight and parallel to the axis, and a little contracted above, arched and patulous in front. The inner lip is slightly convex on the body, on which there is a thin but distinct glaze with a defined edge.  There is a slight angulation at the junction of the body and the columella, near the top of which is a very faint tooth amounting to no more than a slight swelling. The columella itself is very slightly oblique, and is straight, narrow with a sharp edge behind which is a very slight and shallow furrow.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThis marine species occurs off Morocco, Portugal and Spain.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWatson, R.

        "content": "William Davison, or Davidson, (fl. 1635–1660) was a Franco-Scottish chemist and physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nDavison was of Scottish descent, but at an early period settled in Paris, and, through the patronage of Henrietta Maria, wife of Charles I, was named physician to the king of France. Lord Scudamore, English ambassador in Paris, writing to Secretary Windebank, promises to ‘signify to Dr. Davison his majesty's [Charles I] gracious favour. He has been rightly informed concerning the worth of this man, and the benefit his Majesty's subjects receive by him’ (Cal. State Papers, Charles I, Dom. Ser. 1635–6, p. 321). His name also occurs occasionally in subsequent volumes of the ‘Calendars of State Papers,’ in connection with those of persons of eminence who had consulted him. On the title-page of his ‘Prodromus,’ published at the Hague in 1660, he is styled ‘nobilis Scotus,’ formerly councillor and physician to the king of France, and keeper of the Royal Botanic Garden of Paris, and now senior surgeon to the king of Poland. The date of his appointment to be superintendent of the botanic gardens was 1648, and he resigned this appointment to go to Poland in 1650. Evelyn mentions in his ‘Diary’ having gone during his visit to Paris to ‘hear Dr. D'Avisson's lecture in ye physical garden and see his laboratorie, he being prefect of y't excellent garden and Professor Botannicus.’ He is mentioned by La Marolles among several other savants not less distinguished by their knowledge and skill than by their probity (Mémoires, Amsterdam, ed. 1755, iii. 354). Davison was more distinguished as a chemist than a botanist, and was an enthusiastic partisan of the ideas of Paracelsus. His principal work is his ‘Philosophia Pyrotechnica seu Cursus Chymiatricus nobilissima illa et exoptatissima Medicinæ parte Pyrotechnica instructus, multis iisque haud vulgaribus observationibus adornatus.’ Of this work ‘Pars tertia-quarta’ was published in 1633 and also in 1640 (Brit. Mus. Cat.), and ‘Pars primasecunda’ in 1635 and 1642 (Cat., Advocates' Library, Edinburgh). In the copy in the British Museum of the complete edition of the ‘Philosophia Pyrotechnica,’ with the date 1641, there is a portrait of Davison at the age of sixty-nine, but it bears evidence of having been inserted after the volume was bound, and it is improbable that Davison was so old as sixty-nine in 1641. Another edition of the ‘Philosophia Pyrotechnica’ was published in 1657 (Lengley du Fresnoy, Histoire de la Philosophie Hermétique, iii. 3). There is in the British Museum a French translation of the work by Jean Hellot, entitled ‘Eléments de la philosophie de l'art du feu, ou chemie,’ Paris, 1657. Another translation, according to Lenglet du Fresnoy by Davison himself, was published at Paris in 1675 under the title, ‘Eléments de la philosophie de l'art du feu ou cours de chemie.’ In 1651 there appeared at Paris ‘Observations sur l'antimoine et sur la nécessité inevitable de la connoissance et usage de la chemie. Extraits de la Philosophie de l'art du feu ou chemique, du Sieur Davissone.’ This book, of which there is a copy in the British Museum, is probably a translation of the ‘De Natura Antimonii’ mentioned by Lenglet du Fresnoy as published at Paris in 1641. The other works of Davison in the library of the British Museum are: ‘Oblatio Salis, sive Gallia Lege Salis condita,’ 1641; ‘Commentariorum in sublimis philosophi et incomparabilis viri Petri Severini Dani ideam medicinæ philosophicæ prope diem proditurorum Prodromus,’ the Hague, 1660 (another edition was published at the Hague and at Rotterdam in 1668); and ‘Theophrasti veridici Scoti Doctoris Medici Plicomastix seu plicæ e numero morborum apospasma,’ Danzig, 1668. This work was printed at Aberdeen. The ‘Collectanea Chimica Medico-Philosophica Polonica Will. Davisonii’ appeared at Antwerp in 1698\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Henderson, Thomas Finlayson (1888). \"Davison, William (fl.1635-1660)\".

        "content": "Kurixalus yangi, or Yang's frill-limbed tree frog, is a species of frog in the family Rhacophoridae.  It is endemic to India, Myanmar, and China's Yunnan Province.\nThe adult male frog measures 31.6–34.7 mm in snout-vent length. The skin of the dorsum is brown in color. There is yellow and green color on the flanks. There are spots on the upper abdomen. This frog has vomerine teeth, and the iris of the eye is gold in color.\nThis frog lives in evergreen forests between 354 and 1478 meters above sea level. The female frog lays eggs on leaves over water such that the tadpoles fall to the water below upon hatching.\nScientists classify this frog as at least concern of extinction because of its large range. However, it is under some threat from deforestation associated with farming and infrastructure.\nScientists named this frog for Professor Datong Yang of the Chinese Academy of Science for dedication to the country's herpetofauna.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The ongoing Myanmar civil war has had a spillover into other countries, especially India and Bangladesh.\n\n\n== Bangladesh ==\n\nThe spillover of the Myanmar civil war has particularly been a cause of concern to Bangladesh. Beyond the influx of refugees from renewed violence on the border, the rise of the non-state actor Arakan Army created concerns about Rohingya repatriation.\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nThe Rohingya genocide led to around 1 million Rohingya refugees fleeing to Bangladesh. In the first week of September 2020, Bangladeshi forces reported that the Tatmadaw started amassing troops and doing unusual buildups in three different locations on the Bangladesh–Myanmar border. As a consequence, Bangladesh's foreign minister summoned Myanmar's ambassador, calling for him to desist from such activities and to work for mutually beneficial relations between the two countries. As a result, Bangladesh revealed that is ready to face any situation, deploying the 34 Border Guard Bangladesh battalion on the border with Myanmar. This battalion asked their counterparts to arrange a flag meeting but they received no response. \n\n\n=== History ===\nMultiple Tatmadaw artillery strikes have accidentally ended up in Bangladesh territory over the course of the war.\nIn August 2022, Bangladesh strongly protested territorial violations when two Myanmar Army mortar shells hit a Rohingya refugee camp in Bangladesh and when a junta helicopter entered Bangladeshi airspace and fired a shell. Aung Kyaw Moe, the ambassador of Myanmar to Bangladesh, was summoned by the Bangladesh ministry of foreign affairs four times in 2022 due to multiple violations of Bangladesh's airspace in the Naikhongchhari border area by the Myanmar Army.\nOn 3 February 2024, intensifying clashes between the Arakan Army and Tatmadaw in Rakhine state led to mortar shells and bullets landing in Bangladesh, injuring civilians and prompting local villagers to flee. Bangladeshi authorities closed schools and madrasas in border villages. As tensions increased, Bangladesh strengthened the Bangladesh Police and Bangladesh Coast Guard to be stationed to resist any intrusion through the borders. Three hundred and twenty-seven Myanmar Border Guard Police personnel sought refuge in Bangladesh, where they were disarmed and sheltered by the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB). Two days later, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina instructed the Bangladesh Armed Forces and BGB to have patience regarding the situation in Myanmar. On 7 February BGB Director Mohammad Ashrafuzzaman Siddiqui recommended suspending the naval route to St. Martin's Island in Bangladesh due to the increasing border tensions, accordingly, sea travel to St. Martin's Island is indefinitely closed down by the district administration of Cox's Bazar from 10 February. On 8 February 2024, the Tatmadaw agreed to send a ship to take back the stranded BGP personnel in Bangladesh.\n\n\n== India ==\n\nThe renewed ethnic conflict, particularly in Chin state, has fueled the displacement of many into India. On 22 September 2021, after the Battle of Thantlang, nearly 8,000 residents of Thantlang, Chin state, fled to Mizoram, India after houses were set ablaze by the junta army.\nOn January 10 and 12, 2023, Myanmar Air Force carried out airstrikes with one Yak-130 and two MiG-29 targeting Camp Victoria, the Chin National Army (CNA)'s headquarters, near the India-Myanmar border. Five CNA soldiers were killed, at least 10 were injured and some buildings were damaged. The air attacks violated Indian airspace and soil, according to the CNF, local Mizo organizations, and the international research and advocacy organization Fortify Rights. The Chin Human Rights Organization (CHRO) states that at least 200 Chin refugees crossed the border later the week following the airstrikes by Myanmar Army.\nLater in March 2023, the Chinland Defence Force of Matupi engaged in attacks near Paletwa Township. CDF Paletwa assured that on 15 March 2023, Assam Rifles entered Paletwa township and fired gunshots. However, the Assam Rifles denied, saying its soldiers were engaged in “routine border point verification  inside the Indian territory.\"\n\nOn 14 November 2023, the CNA and local CDF forces attacked the Myanmar Army's border guard outpost in Rikhawdar, Falam Township, a hub for border trade with India. The junta responded with air assaults using a jet fighter, to flee into Mizoram, India. A total of 43 Myanmar Army soldiers crossed the India-Myanmar border and sought refuge from the Indian police. They were handed to the Myanmar officials by the Indian authorities through the Moreh-Tamu border. Two days later, residents who had fled to India returned.\nIn late December 2023 and January 2024, fierce fighting in the Rakhine offensive (2023-present), 276 Myanmar army soldiers, with their arms, entered India surrendering to Indian authorities. Because of the influx of refugees and junta soldiers, the Indian government decided to fence the 1,000 miles (1,600 km) border with Myanmar,.\n\n\n=== Impact on Manipuri conflict ===\nAnalysts cite the Myanmar civil war as one of many instigating factors for the increased ethnic violence in Manipur. Drug trafficking and the junta's use of aerial bombing and napalm has destabilized the border region.\nIndia expressed its concern to the junta about its military actions near its sensitive northeastern region in the wake of a massive exodus of refugees into India. In July 2023, there were an estimated 50,000 refugees who had fled to India. These refugees reportedly include many ex-security forces. Minister of Home Affairs Amit Shah stated that the influx of Kuki people from Myanmar created insecurity amongst the Meitei people of Manipur and triggered the violence. According to ground reports, many refugees also brought arms with them and instigated drug turf wars.\nWhile the Myanmar refugees are given familial treatment with compassion to take shelter by the state government of Mizoram, the Manipur government's view on the matter is somewhat divergent. Dominant Zo-Kuki demographic of Manipur's Churachandpur district which borders the state of Mizoram, and the dominant Mizos have strong ethnic relation with each other and with the Kukis of Myanmar. While Chief Minister Zoramthanga of Mizoram, under his governance, shows a sense of compassion towards refugees including ex-forces of Myanmar, at least some Zo-Kuki portion in Manipur are not happy with the attitude of Manipur government, under the leadership of Chief Minister N Biren Singh, towards them who are, if not together, in the proximity of Myanmar immigrants.\n\n\n== Thailand ==\nOn 5 April 2024, the junta garrison in Myawaddy surrendered to the KNLA, allowing anti-junta forces to take the border town. During the capture of Myawaddy, certain junta officials fled into Thailand. The junta requested Thailand for a military flight from Mae Sot to evacuate said officials and others awaiting refuge on the border.\n\n\n== See also ==\nForeign involvement in the Myanmar civil war (2021–present)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Comica, the London International Comics Festival, was a comics festival held in London. Organized by Paul Gravett, the festival generally took place over a number of weeks. In the beginning, the festival's main venue was London's Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA); thus the name, \"ComICA\".\nComica was held in the spirit of European conventions like the Angoulême International Comics Festival. As such, it was focused on the art and literature of the comics form, and only minimally on related pop-culture expression and merchandising. Comica featured panel discussions, graphic novel release signings, workshops, art exhibits, and film screenings, as well as a one-day small press fair (called Comica Comiket). British and North American comics were the main focus, but each festival highlighted work from other countries, including France, Japan, Korea, Italy, and comics from Eastern Europe.\nAnother recurring feature of Comica was the awarding of the Comica Graphic Short Story Prize, sponsored by The Observer newspaper, initially in association with publisher Jonathan Cape.\nIn addition to the festival itself, Comica occasionally produced other comics-related events during the year.\n\n\n== History ==\nAs described in the comics news site The Beat, \"Comica debuted in 2003 as a collaboration between comics expert Paul Gravett, and curator, co-conspirator, and comics-writer John Harris Dunning for the Institute of Contemporary Arts.\" The first Comica Festival was held in late June and early July 2003, taking place over a period of ten days.\nThe theme of the 2004 festival was \"Confessions & Convictions,\" \"highlighting the trend towards autobiography and political commentary prevalent in the comics medium.\" The festival also took place in June over a period of nine days.\nThere was no festival held in 2005, with the only Comica event being an October panel at the ICA on emerging international graphic novelists, with Jessica Abel, Matt Madden, Igort, Paul Wright, Killoffer, Junko Mizuno participating.\nThe Comica Festival returned in 2006, moving to October and taking place over a period of three weeks. (From that point forward, the Comica festival always took place in the fall, usually in October or November.) \n2007 saw the introduction of the Comica Comiket Small Press Fair and the Comica Graphic Short Story Prize (which continued to be awarded after the demise of Comica). \nThe 2009 Comica partnered with Ctrl.Alt.Shift, and produced Ctrl.Alt.Shift  Unmasks Corruption, a comics anthology edited by Gravett, featuring short stories looking at examples of corruption in the real world. It included contributions by comics creators like Pat Mills, Bryan Talbot, Dave McKean, Woodrow Phoenix, Peter Kuper, Dylan Horrocks, and Dan Goldman. An exhibition was held at London's Lazarides Gallery to mark the launch; the exhibition included examples of misguided previous attempts to produce worthy comic books.\nIn 2010, Comica became independent, disassociating from the ICA and registering as a nonprofit organization. That same, year Gravett established the Comica Social Club Meet-Up, \"a monthly meetup for people interested in comics, manga and graphic novels.\"\nGravett produced the 2012 Comica with Megan Donnolley and Peter Stanbury. \nThe 2013 Comica Festival took place October 23–November 16, but prior Comica events that year attracted guests like Jaime Hernandez, Rutu Modan, Brian Bolland, and Frazer Irving.\nThe final Comica Festival took place from mid-October to mid-November 2014; earlier in the year, Comica produced a weekend series of events (in August) at the British Library that featured a Comiket as well as \"Comica Conversations with guests like Bryan Lee O'Malley, Pat Mills, Emmanuel Guibert, Alys Jones, Ian Williams, Jade Sarson, and the CBLDF's Charles Brownstein.\"\nAlthough no Comica Festival was held in 2015, Comica co-sponsored an event at the Institut Français on April 15, 2015: Julie Birmant and Clément Oubrerie in conversation with Paul Gravett. Similarly, in mid-May 2016, Gravett put on a \"Comica London Weekender at London's House of Illustration. This event included a Comica Comiket.\nAfter Comica went defunct, the Comica Social Club Meet-Up became affiliated with the London Comic Mart.\nIn March 2023, the Comica brand was revived as a monthlong series of creator discussions at London's Century Club. Participating cartoonists included Posy Simmonds, Dave McKean, Brian Bolland, and Dave Gibbons.\n\n\n== Graphic Short Story Prize ==\nThe Comica Graphic Short Story Prize was created in 2007 \"with the aim of celebrating the art of the graphic novel and to offer a platform for the graphic novelists of the future to emerge.\" The prize comes with a £1,000 award. The winner is determined by a panel of judges; along with the winner, a runner-up is also announced. A number of prize winners have gone on to have graphic novels published by Jonathan Cape.\nThe award came to be known as the Observer/Cape/Comica Graphic Short Story Prize; it is currently called the Observer/Faber Graphic Short Story Prize.\n\n\n=== List of winners ===\n2007 Catherine Brighton, \"Away In A Manger\"\n2008 Julian Hanshaw, \"Sand Dunes and Sonic Booms\"\n2009 Vivien McDermid, \"Paint\"\n2010 Stephen Collins, \"In Room 208\"\n2011 Isabel Greenberg, \"Love in a Very Cold Climate\"\n2012 Corban Wilkin, \"But I Can't\"\n2013 Emily Haworth-Booth, \"Colonic\"\n2014 Alexis Deacon, \"The River\"\n2015 Richard Woods, \"The Giants of Football\"\n2016 Matthew Dooley, \"Colin Turnbull: A Tall Story\"\n2017 Tor Freeman, \"If You’re So Wise, How Come You’re Dead\"\n2018 Edith Pritchett, \"An Artistic Odyssey\"\n2019 Edo Brenes, \"Memories of Limón\"\n2020 Paul Rainey, \"Similar to But Not Here\"\n2021 Astrid Goldsmith, \"A Funeral in Freiburg\"\n2022 Rebecca K.

(Early in his career, Gravett had run the Fast Fiction booth at the bimonthly Westminster Comics Mart in London. This may have been an inspiration for Comica Comiket, as may have been the long-running Comiket doujinshi convention in Tokyo, Japan.)\nThe first Comica Comiket: Small Press Fair was held at the Institute of Contemporary Arts on 4 Nov 2007. The 2008 Comica Comiket was co-sponsored by London Underground Comics. The 2009 event was co-sponsored by Alternative Press, We Are Words+Pictures, and Nobrow Press. \nThe 2010 Comica Comiket was held in conjunction with the National Collectors Marketplace at the Royal National Hotel, Russell Square. The 2010 event saw the introduction of the \"Drawing Parade,\" organized by Peter Stanbury, in which cartoonists made original drawings projected on a large screen. This became a regular feature of Comica Comiket.\nIn 2013, Comica Comiket became a twice-yearly event: once taking place in the spring and then in the fall during the festival itself. \nIn 2014, a mid-August Comica Comiket was held at the British Library. Exhibitors included Jade Sarson, Gareth Brookes, Hannah Berry, Amber Hsu, Cristian Ortiz, Knockabout Comics, Soaring Penguin, and The Dessinators. The scheduled festival Comica Comiket for November 1, 2014 — to be held at Central Saint Martins — was postponed at a late date and rescheduled for Spring 2015. Instead, a \"CanalCon/Comica Comiket\" was held September 20, 2015, on the Floating Cinema barge, Granary Square, Central Saint Martin’s College of Art and Design — exhibitors included Rebellion Publishing, SelfMadeHero, Knockabout Comics, First Second Books, Soaring Penguin, Centrala Books, Escape Books; guests included Dave Gibbons. (By this time, the Comica festival itself had gone defunct.)\nIn 2016, two final Comica Comikets were held: one in the spring and one in the fall. The spring 2016 event — \"Comica Comiket: The Independent Comics Market\" — was held in London's House of Illustration as part of the \"Comica London Weekender\"; the Drawing Parade was touted as the \"Cavalcade of Celebrity Cartoonists\". The fall — and final — Comica Comiket was for the first time held outside of London, in Surrey, at The Lightbox in Woking. Exhibitors included Nick Hayes, Jessica Martin, and Gary Northfield.\n\n\n=== Comiket dates and locations ===\n\n\n== Comica festival dates ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nAngoulême International Comics Festival\nComiket\nInternational Comic Arts Forum\nThe Lakes International Comic Art Festival\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nComica London Facebook page",

        "content": "In the GDR, the license number was a book identification number. It was assigned as part of the printing approval procedure introduced in the early 1950s.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn the GDR – and previously in the Soviet Occupation Zone (SBZ) – publishers generally required a publishing license to operate as a publisher. This was initially issued by the Soviet Military Administration in Germany (SMAD), then from 1951 by the Office for Literature and Publishing (Main Administration for Publishers and Book Trade) and, after its integration into the Ministry of Culture, by the Ministry.\nIndependently of this, each edition of a book had to be individually licensed as part of the so-called printing approval process. After this process was completed, the book received a printing approval number – provided that it had been approved for printing. In those books, the specific printing approval number usually had to be stated in the imprint (see e.g. TGL 24464). The publishers usually put the number of their publishing license in front of this. Together, these formed the license number of the book.\nSome publishers were able to deviate from this rule, however: for example, Dietz-Verlag and the Militärverlag der DDR only had to state their publishing license in their books, but not the printing approval number. For the Volk und Wissen publishing house, there was a regulation that all books that were confirmed as school books by the Ministry of Education could be published under a uniform printing permit.\nThe printing permit procedure and thus the regulations for specifying the license numbers in the books lasted until December 1, 1989. After that, during a short transitional period, the publishers only printed the number of their publishing license as the license number in the imprint, before this too became unnecessary in the course of reunification.\n\n\n== Creation of the license number ==\nThe license number consisted of several parts: As a rule, the publisher's license number was given first (often together with the abbreviation VLN). This was usually separated from the printing authorization number by a period and a space (\".\"). However, some publishers also used other characters (\"/\", \"-\" or \"·\") or spaces instead. This was usually handled uniformly within a publisher.\nThe printing approval number consisted of three parts separated by a slash (“/”): the publisher number, a number running within a year and the year of publication. The publisher number and the publisher's license number were not identical and could not be derived from one another. The publisher number was permanently assigned to a publisher as part of the printing approval process and makes it possible to determine the publisher from the printing approval number alone.\nIn this way, books could be uniquely identified using the printing permit number. Since each new edition of a book had to be licensed again, each edition of a book was also assigned a new license number.\nAs a rule, the number of the publishing license and the publishing number within the printing permit number remained unchanged over the years. However, they could sometimes change over time - e.g. in connection with restructuring, mergers and spin-offs of publishing houses.\n\n\n== References ==",

Upon his return to Mauritius he worked as a lecturer at the newly formed University of Mauritius. In early 1982 he was one of the nine academics from that institution who stood as candidates at the general elections of 11 June 1982.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nIn 1979 Kailash Ruhee was one of the founding members of the PSM, along with Harish Boodhoo, Armoogum Parsooraman, Yousouf Maudarbocus, and Ashok Roy. They were nicknamed \"the five rare birds\" by Harish Boodhoo at PSM's first rally meeting which was held in July 1979 at Belle-Rose markets.At the June 1982 general elections Kailash Ruhee was a candidate of Boodhoo's PSM within the MMM-PSM coalition in Constituency No. 18. Other candidates of this coalition who also previously worked as lecturers at the University of Mauritius were Swalay Kasenally, Régis Finette, Kishore Deerpalsing, and Dharam Ghokool. Given the 60-0 landslide victory of the MMM-PSM coalition against the Labour Party-PMSD regime, Kailash Ruhee was elected along with Paul Bérenger and Devanand Routho in Constituency No. 18. He became a minister in the ruling government of Jugnauth and Boodhoo. However, on 22 March 1983 Ruhee formed part of the 11 out of 18 inexperienced ministers who resigned from the MMM-MSM government, blaming PSM's Deputy Prime Minister Harish Boodhoo for exerting undue influence over Prime Minister Anerood Jugnauth. Kailash Ruhee and Jocelyn Seenyen were 2 of the 5 PSM ministers of the Jugnauth-Boodhoo government who defected to join Paul Bérenger's MMM.At the 21 August 1983 general elections Kailash Ruhee stood once again as a candidate of the MMM in Constituency No. 18 but was defeated by Michael Glover, Anil Gayan and Raj Virah-sawmy of the MSM-Labour coalition.At the 30 August 1987 general elections the MMM-MTD-FTS coalition presented Kailash Ruhee as one of its three candidates in Constituency No. 16 (Vacoas Floréal) and he was elected to the Legislative Assembly.At the 15 September 1991 general elections Kailash Ruhee was presented, along with Rama Sithanen and Michael Glover, as candidates of the MSM-MMM coalition in Constituency No. 18 (Belle Rose & Quatre Bornes), all three men were elected to the Legislative Assembly, and they were all appointed as ministers of the ruling government. In August 1993 Anerood Jugnauth revoked Paul Bérenger from the MSM-MMM government, and by October 1993 two rival factions formed within the MMM, one led by Prem Nababsing and the other by Paul Bérenger as the latter was becoming too close to the Labour Party. On 26 June 1994 Prem Nababsing launched a new party Renouveau Militant Mauricien (RMM) during a public rally held in Rose Hill. Kailash Ruhee, was among several ex-MMM ministers and politicians (such as Jean-Claude de l’Estrac, Swaley Kasenally, Dharmanand Fokeer, Prem Koonjoo, Mathieu Laclé, Jérome Boulle, Noel Lee Cheong Lem, Bashir Khodabux, Osman Gendoo, Dharam Gokhool, and Amédée Darga) who also vouched their full support to Prem Nababsing and newly-formed RMM.However, Kailash Ruhee did not contest the 20 December 1995 general elections which resulted in the victory of a coalition made up of 5 parties PTR–PMXD–VF–MR–MMSM.In January 2006 Kailash Ruhee was appointed by Navin Ramgoolam as Chief of Staff and Senior Adviser at the Prime Minister's Office. His main role was to reform the civil service.By October 2006 Kailash Ruhee was nominated by the government as Ambassador to the USA, replacing Usha Jeetah who had also been defeated as candidate of the MMM-MSM coalition at the 2005 general elections. He served in this role until late 2009 after which he returned to Mauritius to work as advisor at the Prime Minister's Office.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Sebkha of Oran is a salt lake located within the territory of the municipality of Misserghin, in the province of Oran, Algeria.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe Sebkha of Oran is a lake located 15 km south of Oran in the municipality of Misserghin, and it is about 12 km away from the Mediterranean Sea. It is a depression situated at an altitude of 110 meters, bounded to the north by the Murdjajo Massif and to the south by the Tessala Massif. The sebkha occupies the bottom of this depression, appearing to have a flat topography but slightly inclined towards the west, with a low point at 80 meters above sea level and a high point at 82 meters. It has an elliptical shape, approximately 40 km in length with a southwest–northeast orientation, and a width ranging from 6 to 13 km.\nThe lake is fed by a hydrographic network primarily flowing from the Tessala and Murdjajo Massifs. However, the water in this area is saline. The lake, which forms a thin layer of water ranging from 10 to 30 cm depending on the rainfall, completely dries up during the summer due to high evaporation rates and the region's drought. The climate is semi-arid Mediterranean, with annual precipitation ranging between 378 and 473 mm.\nThe surrounding lands near the lake are used for agriculture. The salt from the lake has negative effects on the southern fringes of the Oran agglomeration as well as the runways of Oran Airport.\nThe Sebkha of Oran has been recognized as a Ramsar site since February 2, 2001. According to Emberger, the climate in Es Senia is classified as semi-arid.\n\n\n== Flora ==\nThe halophytic vegetation of this vast sebkha has been the subject of several in-depth scientific studies. According to K. Bahi, it is evident that \"the wetlands in the Oran region exhibit a floristic biodiversity that deserves protection and conservation.\"\nThe surrounding watersheds of the sebkha are covered with Aleppo pine forests, eucalyptus, cork oak, and thuja.\n\n\n== Fauna ==\nNumerous migratory bird species reside in the wetlands of western Oran. The lake is home to two significant bird species, often exceeding the 1% international threshold: the greater flamingo and the northern shoveler. For example, in February 1972, 1,450 flamingos were counted. Depending on food availability, these birds may move between this lake, the marshes of Macta, and the Sebkha of Arzew (Johnson, in litt.).\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nSebkha el Melah, Béni Abbès",

He is best known for producing the act known as Rose's Royal Midgets, who performed in vaudeville and toured internationally between the early 1900s and 1950s, in later years managed by his widow.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nIsaac Rosenstamm was born in Norden, Hanover (now in Lower Saxony, Germany) in 1865.  He traveled with his family to the United States as a young child, and grew up in New York City.  He was married in 1896 to Clarice Campbell (born Clarissa Molony; 1878 – 1964), who performed as a vaudeville dancer under the name Saharet.  Their daughter Carrie was born later in 1896, in New York.\nRose worked as a theatrical agent, for his wife and also for other clients including Harry Houdini, Ruth St. Denis, the Hilton Sisters, and Chung Ling Soo.   He became known for booking American artists onto European stages, and vice versa.  He also led a cowboy-themed troupe, Ike Rose's Historical Wild West Show, which toured Australia in the early 1910s.    \nHe and Saharet divorced in 1912, and he married Carla Richmann (1891 – 1983) in London the following year.  Soon afterwards, while in Europe and following the example of Leo Singer, he formed a group of performing \"midgets\", as people of unusually short stature were then generally known.  Most of the performers were from Germany.  By 1922, the troupe were performing regularly on vaudeville stages in the United States, and added American members to their numbers.  They also included a woman from Java, purportedly of royal blood, and acquired the name \"Rose's Royal Midgets\" though the troupe was often also billed under other names such as \"Rose's Parisian Midget Revue\".   The number of performers varied over the years, from about nine up to 35, and averaging over 20.  They were billed as \"The Greatest Organization of Miniature Men and Women Ever Gathered from the Far Corners of the World..  Atoms of Humanity... Giants of Ability\".  Their act included acrobatics, dancing, juggling, music, and magic tricks, and audiences and critics were generally impressed by the spectacle.\nIke Rose died in San Diego, California, in 1935.  His wife Carla, often credited as Mrs. Ike Rose, continued to manage the troupe, who performed mainly at fairs, carnivals and circuses.  The act continued performing until the late 1950s.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Dharavi Island (also known as Dharavi Bhet) is an island situated at the mouth of Vasai Creek on the western side of Salsette Island, within the city of Mumbai, India. Dharavi Island comprises six villages, Dongri, Uttan, Pali, Chowk, Gorai, and Manori. \n\n\n== History ==\n\nDharavi Island is located on the western side of Salsette, situated at the mouth of the Bassein creek. The island is named after the Dharavi Devi Mandir, a Hindu temple dedicated to the mother goddess Dharavi. The word, Dharavi translates to loose mud in Tamil language. There, confusion often arises between Dharavi Island and Dharavi, a residential slum area of Mumbai.\nDharavi Island is also home to the East Indian community, who are considered the original residents of Bombay, tracing their roots back to places like the Isle of Bombay, Thane, Salsette, and Bassein (now Vasai). In the 15th and 16th centuries, Portuguese missionaries converted locals to Roman Catholicism, particularly among farming, fishing, and salt-making communities.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nKulvem Village in Gorai retains much of its traditional ambience. The East Indians are mainly engaged in agriculture, and live in century-old homes with Mangalorean tiled roofs, wooden balconies, and spacious kitchens equipped with backdoors for livestock like pigs.\nIn Uttan, the East Indian Museum, founded by the Mogai Gauthan Panchayat, displays artefacts like the 'Puraan', a Bible from 17th-century, written in the East Indian language using the Roman script.\nThere are many religious places on the island, like Our Lady of the Sea Church in Uttan, which was built around 1664, and the over 400-year-old Our Lady of Bethlehem Church. The remnants of Infant Jesus Church, which was destroyed after the Maratha invasion in 1739, are visible from Vairala Tank.\nThese villages of Dharavi Island are primarily inhabited by marginalized communities, including the Kolis, the Kunbis, and the Bhandaris.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nWomen's groups on Dharavi Island engage in various activities, including preparing fish and vegetable pickles, crafting bottle masalas, and making rice handbreads. They also run catering services, make candles, and participate in other Income Generation Programs (IGPs). These groups receive ongoing training to improve product quality and marketing abilities.\n\n\n== Archaeology ==\nIn the archaeological discoveries of Dharavi Island, two Gadhegals or donkey stones from the 12th century were found, depicting a donkey engaged in intercourse with a woman. Over generations, villagers have held these stones in reverence. In 2012, archaeologists interpreted these stones as declarations of land grants, warning of severe punishment for trespassers.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGorai\nManori\nDongri Fort\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024–25 Arizona Wildcats men's basketball team will represent the University of Arizona during the 2024–25 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The team will be led by Tommy Lloyd, in his fourth season as head coach. It will be the Wildcats' 51st season at McKale Center in Tucson, Arizona. It will be their first season as members of the Big 12 Conference.\n\n\n== Previous season ==\n\nThe Wildcats finished the 2023–24 season 27–9, 15–5 in Pac-12 Conference play, winning their 18th and final Pac-12 regular season title and overall 1 seed in the Pac-12 tournament. They lost their semifinal match up against eventual tournament champion Oregon 68–75. The Wildcats were invited to their 34th NCAA tournament appearance, receiving the number 2 seed in the West Regional. They lost in the Sweet Sixteen to number 6 seed Clemson 72–77.\n\n\n== Offseason ==\n\n\n=== Coaching staff changes ===\nAs of March 2024, the Wildcats had no coaching staff changes.\n\n\n=== Departures ===\nDue to COVID-19, the NCAA ruled in October 2020 that the 2020–21 season would not count against the eligibility of any basketball player, thus giving all players the option to return in 2022–23. Additionally, any players who have declared for the 2024 NBA draft—including seniors, who must opt into this year's draft—have the option to return if they make a timely withdrawal from the draft and end any pre-draft relationships with agents. Thus, separate lists will initially be maintained for confirmed and potential departures.\n\n\n=== Acquisitions ===\n\n\n==== 2024 recruiting class ====\n\n*Originally class of 2025, but reclassified to 2024\n\n2024 overall class rankings\n\n*ESPN has not made 2024 recruiting class rankings yet.\n\n\n=== Red and Blue game ===\nThe annual Red-Blue game will take place at McKale Center during the fall with the date and time being announced sometime during the summer.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== Roster ===\nRoster below is based on the 2023–24 roster with outgoing players removed and incoming players added. The roster will undergo multiple changes as players leave via the NBA draft or transfers and players are added via the transfer portal and recruiting.\n\nNote: Players' year is based on remaining eligibility. The NCAA did not count the 2020–21 season towards eligibility.\n\n\n== Schedule ==\nThe Wildcats non-conference schedule will be announced in the summer and the conference schedule will be announced during the fall.  Arizona has confirmed games against Duke at McKale Center, Wisconsin in Madison, Alabama in Birmingham, Purdue in Las Vegas at T-Mobile Arena, an opponent to be determined in the 2024 Big East–Big 12 Battle and has been confirmed to play in the 2024 Battle 4 Atlantis, which includes Gonzaga, Indiana, Louisville, Creighton, West Virginia, Oklahoma and Davidson.  Due to the tournament format, Arizona will be guaranteed one game in the 2025 Big 12 tournament.\n\nSource:\n\n\n== Rankings ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n2024–25 Arizona Wildcats women's basketball team\n\n\n== References ==",

The courthouse opened on July 16, 2018, on a site across St. Louis Street from the John Archibald Campbell U. S. Courthouse.  The façade of the new courthouse was built of limestone from the same quarry in Russellville, Alabama, that was used for the Archibald Courthouse 80 years prior.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSouthern District of Alabama",

Known for its large size, males can weigh between 1.2 to 3.2 kg (2.6 to 7.1 lb) with a wingspan ranging from 131–188 cm (4 ft 4 in – 6 ft 2 in).  This owl features distinctive ear tufts, mottled upper parts with dark blackish and tawny coloring, barred wings and tail, and variably hued buff underparts streaked with darker shades. Primarily nocturnal predators, they feed on small mammals like rodents and rabbits, along with occasional larger prey. This species thrives in diverse habitats, particularly mountainous or rocky areas near woodland edges, shrubby regions, and wetlands where they hunt for their prey. While they have been observed in city parks and suburbs, they are not native to North America.\nGladys was a member of the Minnesota Zoo's bird show, known as the ambassador of her species. Raised from a chick, the zoo staff worked with her daily.\n\n\n== Escape and monitoring ==\nDuring a routine exercise and training session on October 1, 2021, Gladys flew off into a tree. Initially staying close by, she gradually wandered further away, Zoo staff tracked her movements through various trees on the zoo property. Despite efforts to locate her, sightings became sporadic, leading zoo officials to seek help from neighbors in keeping an eye out for her.\nMinnesota's cold seasons were not a concern for its short term survival as Eurasian eagle-owls can survive in cold climates. While Gladys did not seem to pose a threat to people, there was a possibility that people may pose a threat to her. \nThe 5-year-old owl was found injured on the side of the road on the morning of October 14, 2021, two weeks after she went missing. Gladys died before the zoo staff could provide treatment. The injuries indicated that the cause of her death was likely due to an impact, possibly involving a vehicle.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nFormer A Prairie Home Companion host and author Garrison Keillor compared Gladys' escape and that of the Central Park Zoo in New York City eagle-owl, Flaco years later in an essay about captivity demanded relationships and nature of love and need.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of individual birds\nFlaco (owl)\nBarry (owl)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Tarbula (d. between 341 and 349), also called Tarbu, Therbuta, Pherbutha, and Phermoutha, was a Persian saint, virgin, and martyr who was martyred by being cut in half by saw after being accused of witchcraft and causing the illness of the Persian queen. Her feast day is April 4.\n\n\n== Life ==\nTarbula was born in what is now modern-day Iraq. Her brother was Saint Symeon (also called Simeon), bishop of what is now Al-Mada'in. Tarbula, along with her sister and servant, who were also virgins and lived together \"in a kind of ascetic house community\", but were brought to the royal court to attend the queen of Persian emperor Shapur II. Tarbula was \"distinguished by her extraordinary beauty\"; the Roman lawyer and Church historian Sozomen called Tarbula \"beautiful and very stately in form\". The queen suggested that she marry to increase her position, but Tarbula refused because she had made a vow to a life of service to God and virginity. One of the sorcerers of the queen's court offered to marry Tarbula as well, but she also refused him; he might have accused the three women of poisoning the queen.\nAll three women were accused of witchcraft and for causing the queen's illness, in retaliation for the death of Symeon. A few sources blame the Jewish leaders for their arrest, conviction, and execution; the queen was a Jewish convert and \"had great confidence in the attachment of her co-religionists\". According to Sozomen, the case against the women was interpreted as retaliation against Emperor Constantine's banning of the prostitution of young girls and the destruction of the temple of Venus. One of the case's judges became \"deeply enamored with her\" and secretly proposed that she have intercourse with him in exchange for money and her freedom and the freedom of her sister and servant, but Tarbula refused. The other two judges also offered the women freedom in exchange for intercourse with them. The women were found guilty, condemned to death, and were cut in half by saw, then dismembered. Their execution was called an \"especially cruel martyrdom\". The queen was advised to pass between the women's bodies to dissolve their curse against her and to heal her disease. Their bodies were thrown into a ditch, which Christians secretly retrieved and buried.\nTarbula's feast day is April 4.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Works cited ==\nDunbar, Agnes B.C. (1901).

Angel's sexual advances are initially rejected by Teresa, and upon seeing her with her husband, Angel ends up attempting suicide again.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film is an Emiliano Piedra PC production. It boasted a 70 million ₧ budget. Shooting locations included Torrelodones.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe film screened at the 41st Venice International Film Festival in September 1984. The film was not received with enthusiasm by critics, who generally considered it to be a minor, yet self-consciously minor, addition to Saura's filmography.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Spanish films of 1984\n\n\n== References ==",

The latter, however, is a misspelling of Colostracon Hamlin, 1884, a genus of Mesozoic caenogastropods unrelated to the Recent Mediterranean species. Recognizing this situation, Repetto & Bianco established the name Callostracon for the Mediterranean species. Callostracon Repetto & Bianco, 2012, is not a junior homonym of \"Callostracon\" as used by Nordsieck, as the latter is an incorrect subsequent spelling, and thus not a nomenclaturally available name. \n\n\n== Species ==\nCallostracon amabile (R. B. Watson, 1883)\nCallostracon chariis (R. B. Watson, 1883)\nCallostracon tyrrhenicum (Smriglio & Mariottini, 1996)\n\n\n== References ==\n\nRepetto G. & Bianco I. (2012) Callostracon n. gen.

        "content": "Ada Sereni (née Ascarelli) (June 20, 1905 – November 24, 1997) was one of the heads of the Mossad LeAliyah Bet in Italy, one of the founders of Givat Brenner, and a recipient of the Israel Prize for special contribution to society and the country.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nBorn as Ada Ascarelli in 1905 in Rome to the Ascarelli family, a wealthy Jewish Sephardic Jewish family who count Devorà Ascarelli was an ancestor. Her parents were Ettore (1847–1919), and Emma Tagliacozzo (1882–1978). Her father died when she enrolled in high school. Her mother survived the Holocaust by escaping the roundup of Italian Jews on October 16, 1943, and hiding in the convent of the nuns of Notre-Dame de Sion. Her paternal grandfather was Tranquillo Ascarelli, former president of the Israelite University. Her maternal grandfather Ariel, as the Pope's wool supplier, had never had to submit to the restrictions that kept other Roman Jews in the Jewish ghetto.\nShe attended T. Mamiani High School in Rome, where she met Enzo Sereni, who was already active in the Zionist movement. They got married in 1925 at the age of 20 when Enzo received a degree in philosophy from University of Rome; Ada abandons her degree in chemistry. In 1926 they announce to their families they are moving to Israel, doing so in  February 1927 with their infant daughter Hannah (b. July 4, 1926), settling in Rehovot. They were among the first Italians to immigrate (make Aliyah) to Israel.\n\n\n=== Move to Israel and Givat Brenner ===\nSereni found the move to Rehovot very difficult, referring to them as \"the worst time in her life.\" second daughter Hagar (b. July 2, 1927) and While Enzo worked in the orchards, Ada stayed at home caring for their two daughters, the second daughter, Hagar (b. July 2, 1927), was born in Israel.\nIn June 1928, per Sereni's direction, she and her family joined the group founding Givat Brenner, one of Israel's largest Kibbutzes. Her son Daniel (b. March 8, 1931) is born there. \n\nWhile the Kibbutz had no infrastructure (water was carried in on donkeys), Sereni adapted well to life there. She became the director of the pomegranate juice and preserves factory. In 1931 she had her third child, a son named Daniel. In the 1930s, the family joined Enzo on several missions on behalf of the kibbutz and the Zionist movement to Italy, Germany, and the United States. While in New York, Sereni organized a commune of young Israeli pioneers and educators, all living in the same house with their families.\n\nIn 1944, Enzo, against Sereni's wishes, volunteered to go behind enemy lines in Italy to make contact with the Jews who survived there. According to Ada:\"That was perhaps the only time I told Enzo not to pursue his choice. He was adamant.\"After he was deployed on May 15, 1944, all contact with him was lost. At the end of World War II, when Enzo was not among the prisoners who returned, Sereni turned to Shaul Avigur, the head of the Mossad LeAliyah Bet, and with his approval went to Italy to attempt to trace the fate of her husband.\n\n\n=== Mossad LeAliyah Bet in Italy ===\nIn Italy, Sereni learned through written testimony that Enzo was executed in Dachau concentration camp in November 1944.\nThere, Sereni met Yehuda Arazi who coordinated the activities of Mossad LeAliyah Bet and accepted Sereni into the mission. Her official mission was to establish clubs for the members of the Jewish Brigade, in reality she worked to support the Mossad's mission of  facilitating then-prohibited Jewish immigration to British Palestine.\nFrom June 1945 until the Establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, Sereni worked for the group in Italy. From 1945 to 1947 Sereni was Arazi's deputy, taking over as the head from April 1947 – until the establishment of the State of Israel in May 1948.\nSereni duties included purchasing ships ranging from fishing boats to boats able to contain thousands of passengers, organizing the supplies and influx of refugees as well as making sure they were able to survive the journey. She directly intervened in February 1946 when the ship Fede was stopped by Italian authorities, enabling the ship to leave La Spezia in Italy. She once ended up in prison.\n\nFrom 1945 to 1948, Sereni is credited with organizing between 33 and 38 expeditions, illicitly sending more than 25,000 Jews (some estimates say 28,000) from Italy to Israel on dozens of ships setting out from various locations along the Italian coast. One ship was named the Enzo Sereni which successfully sailed to Haifa with 551 men and 357 women, many of whom were former partisans.\nIn Sereni's travels across Italy, she was driven by a volunteer, Mordechai Hod, later the commander of the Israeli Air Force.\n\n\n=== Establishment of the State of Israel ===\nOnce the State of Israel was established and Jewish immigration was openly allowed, Sereni became involved in the clandestine procurement of weapons and other warfare for Israel, as well as the Mossad's operational activity to prevent the procurement of weapons to Arab countries through Operation Robbery. In an unofficial meeting with Italian Prime Minister Alcide De Gasperi, she convinced him to grant her passive complicity for her task from the Italian authorities.\n\n\n==== 1950s ====\nReturning to Israel in 1950, Sereni moved to Tel Aviv, becoming active in various civil issues. With Yehuda Arazi and Maurizio Vitale, she founded the Ramat Aviv Hotel. By naming the hotel Sereni indirectly chose the name of the neighborhood Ramat Aviv as well.\nIn 1954, Sereni's son Daniel and his wife Ofra Sereni (née Katron), who was pregnant at the time, were killed in Ma'agan, when a plane crashed into a crowd participating in a memorial ceremony for paratroopers, like his father Enzo, who operated in Europe in World War II.\nIn 1958, Sereni  joined Nativ, a branch of Israel's secret service focused on helping Jews from the Soviet Union immigrate to Israel. That same year, Sereni sent a letter to David Ben-Gurion, Israel's Prime Minister, requesting approval for her effort of \"Judaizing the goyim.\" With her approval, she went on mission to Italy from 1958 to 1967 to establish a lobby among the Italian elite for the Jews of the Soviet Union. She returned to Israel in 1968.\n\n\n==== 1960s ====\nImmediately after the Six-Day War, Sereni was appointed by Israel prime minister Levi Eshkol to, with Shlomo Gazit, be responsible for \"concentrating efforts to encourage the residents of the Gaza Strip to leave the country.\"\n\n\n=== Awards ===\nIn 1995 Sereni received the Israel Prize for special contribution to society and the country.\nSereni published an autobiography \"I Clandestini Del Mara\", \"The Hidden Passengers of the Sea\". In Hebrew it was titled, \"Ships Without a Flag.\"\nIn the 1960 movie Exodus, Ada is represented.\nIn 2007, a film called \"Exodus: Ada's Dream\" was produced based on Sereni's autobiography, about her actions and efforts to organize the immigration of thousands of displaced Jews in Italy after World War II. It was broadcast on Italian television as a 4-episode miniseries on January 28 and 29, 2006 for Holocaust Remembrance Day, as well as on Israeli television. The film was screened at several festivals in the United States and at the 2007 World Jewish Film Festival in Tel Aviv, receiving enthusiastic feedback.\n\n\n== End of life ==\nSereni helped found the Associazione Italia-Israele.\nSereni died in Jerusalem on November 24, 1998, at the age of 92.\n\n\n== References ==",

The new emblem was unveiled two weeks later, with the traditional green sun having changed hue in a gradient from dark to lighter from left to right.\n\n\n== Results ==\nThe complete vote count showed that 179,005 members of the movement participated, with the change of emblem and name receiving 95% of the votes.\n\n\n== See also ==\n2021 KINAL leadership election\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Joseph Drummond (April 7, 1926 – January 13, 1975) was a Canadian activist based in Saint John, New Brunswick. He became involved with the NAACP and the civil rights movement in the United States and later in his home province of New Brunswick. \nDrummond was a key figure of the NBAACP, New Brunswick's branch of the NAACP. In 1964, he staged a sit-in at a Saint John barbershop to protest against barbers refusing to serve Black people. He also served as a member of the New Brunswick Human Rights Commission and as vice-chairman of the National Black Coalition in Canada. Drummond was also a parliamentary candidate for the New Democratic Party during the 1972 federal election.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nJoseph Drummond was born on April 7, 1926 in Saint John, New Brunswick to parents John Drummond and Agnes Stewart. While serving in the Royal Canadian Navy, he became interested in civil rights and became involved with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) while in Norfolk, Virginia, in 1941. In 1949, he helped lead a Canadian Seamen's Union strike. In 1957, he started participating in activism, shortly after which he was made to leave the Navy. In 1961, Drummond became a field worker in the NAACP's New York City headquarters and became a member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference two years later.\nDrummond also became involved with the NAACP as well as civil rights activism in his hometown of Saint John. On May 12, 1964, while serving as the vice-president of the New Brunswick Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NBAACP), he organized a sit-in with two other NBAACP members at a barbershop in Saint John's Haymarket Square to protest against the owner's refusal to serve Black men. The owner, Tom Arbing, proclaimed that he had \"never cut a colored person's hair in 55 years.\" Drummond stated that the New Brunswick Fair Accommodations Act was only being followed by a few of the city's barbers. In addition, he spoke about Black people facing difficulties when it comes to accessing suitable housing and employment.\nDrummond served as the vice-chairman of the National Black Coalition in Canada and was a member of the New Brunswick Human Rights Commission, which he resigned from in 1971, citing his \"frustration of trying to do a job and unable to get it done.\" Drummond was also involved in politics, running as the New Democratic Party candidate for the Saint John—Lancaster riding during the 1972 federal election, where he lost to Progressive Conservative candidate Thomas Miller Bell.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nOn January 13, 1975, Drummond died in hospital at the age of 48. Several years prior to his death, in 1966, he had undergone open heart surgery in Montreal. In 2021, a mural containing two portraits of Drummond and Lena O'Ree, another civil rights activist in the city, were displayed in Saint John's north end neighbourhood.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBlack Canadians in New Brunswick\nFred Hodges, another activist from Saint John.

        "content": "Viktor Brandt (born 8 July 1999) is a Swedish biathlete. He is the 2024 World Champion in the Men's Relay.\n\n\n== Career ==\nViktor Brandt competed in the Youth World Championships for the first time in 2017, but did not achieve any special results. He took part in the season highlight every year in the following years until 2021, but did not compete at senior level. However, the races at junior level were rarely successful for Brandt, only achieving a result in the top 30 in 2021 with 26th place in the sprint at the Junior World Championships. The Swede celebrated his debut in the IBU Cup in Idre in November 2021 and immediately finished 17th in the sprint. He then confirmed his good form with a seventh place in the second sprint in Idre, and his first podium finish came after the turn of the year in the single-mixed relay in Obertilliach alongside Elisabeth Högberg behind the Russian team. Brandt also took part in the European Championships and finished 21st in the individual race. The Swede also competed almost exclusively in the IBU Cup in the 2022/23 season, achieving a seventh place in the mass start 60 in Ridnaun and narrowly missing out on another podium finish with Ella Halvarsson in Canmore. As Emil Nykvist was unable to compete due to illness, he made his World Cup debut in Östersund at the end of the season and finished 47th in the individual race. \nIn the winter of 2023/24, Brandt competed in the season-opening individual event in Östersund, but was then transferred to the IBU Cup. However, as he impressed in Sjusjøen with three top 10 finishes, including fifth place in the sprint, the Swede was called back into the World Cup after the turn of the year, reached the first pursuit race at the highest level in Oberhof and scored his first World Cup points with 32nd place in the short individual race in Antholz.At the 2024 World Championships in Nové Město, he became the champion in the relay race together with Jesper Nelin, Martin Ponsiluoma and Sebastian Samuelsson.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nViktor Brandt lives at the biathlon base in Östersund. He studies computer science at Mid Sweden University, also in Östersund. Brandt's brother Oskar, who is four years older, is also a biathlete.\n\n\n== Biathlon results ==\nAll results are sourced from the International Biathlon Union.\n\n\n=== World Championships ===\n1 medal (1 gold)\n\n\n=== World Cup ===\n\n\n==== Relay podiums ====\n\n\n=== Youth and Junior World Championships ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nViktor Brandt at IBU",

She worked as a sales agent at MagForce for the Central Africa region. She founded a cultural association that aimed to promote Bantu culture, Reine Bantou. In 2015, she organized the first Reine Bantou gala. She arranged the second organization's gala, the Gala of African Royalty, in 2018 and the event elected a Bantu queen.\nYanzere then moved to France and worked at a company that supported the elders. While working in France, she founded the Association for Support to Touadera in 2019 and became the general coordinator of the organization.\n\n\n== Minister of Arts, Culture and Tourism ==\nDondra appointed Yanzere minister of arts, culture, and tourism on 24 June 2021. She aimed to make the Central African Republic a destination for leisure and business activities to stimulate the country's economic growth. Yanzere founded the National Artistic Ensemble in July 2021. On 19 July 2022, she commenced the tourism development policy. She also suspended the activities of the Union of Musicians of the Central African Republic (UMC) on 10 October 2023 due to internal conflict within the organization. While serving as the minister, Yanzere participated in the 2023 Central African constitutional referendum campaign by joining pro-referendum group as the vice president of Mobilization and Propaganda Commission.\nNevertheless, Yanzere tenure as minister was marked by controversies. She banned the \"We, Students\" documentary because it \" incited revolution against the government.\" Previously, she walked out from the documentary screening in Bangui. Apart from that, she embezzled the government's artist subsidy for Yanzere and her staff's personal gain.\n\n\n== Post ministerial career ==\nYanzere stepped down as the minister of arts, culture, and tourism on 4 January 2024 and the position was replaced by Ngola Françoise Ramadan Mahata.

        "content": "On 14 August 2018, around 11:36 local time (09:36 UTC) a section of the Ponte Morandi (English: Morandi Bridge) in Genoa, Liguria, Italy collapsed during a rainstorm, killing forty-three people. The remains were demolished in June 2019. The replacement bridge, the Genoa-Saint George Bridge was inaugurated a year later.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe cable-stayed bridge was designed by civil engineer Riccardo Morandi, from whom its unofficial name was derived. The viaduct was built between 1963 and 1967  along the A10 motorway over the Polcevera River and officially opened on 4 September 1967.\n\n\n== Collapse ==\nOn 14 August 2018, around 11:36 local time (09:36 UTC), during a torrential rainstorm, a 210-meter (690 ft) section of Ponte Morandi collapsed. The collapsed span was centred on the westernmost cable-stayed pillar, pillar 9, and crossed the Polcevera, as well as an industrial area of Sampierdarena. Eyewitnesses reported that the bridge was hit by lightning before it collapsed. Between 30 and 35 cars and three trucks were reported to have fallen from the bridge.\nA large part of the collapsed bridge and the vehicles on it fell into the rain-swollen Polcevera. Other parts landed on the tracks of the Turin–Genoa and Milan–Genoa railways, and on warehouses belonging to Ansaldo Energia, an Italian power engineering company. The latter were largely empty because the collapse occurred on the eve of a major Italian public holiday, Ferragosto.\nThe initial hypotheses were that a structural weakness or a landslide caused the collapse. The bridge was reportedly undergoing maintenance at the time of the collapse, including strengthening the road foundations.\nThe southern stays reportedly gave way explosively due to corrosion and damage. With only four stays, one of them giving way might have been enough for the structure to lose stability. A preliminary investigative report suggested the pillar itself may have collapsed first, but Genoa prosecutors had not provided the report's authors with a local video showing the southern stays gave way first. There is speculation that lightning may have struck the stays, or a landslide could have destabilised the base.\n\nIn July 2019, a video showing the fall of the bridge was made public. It originated from the nearby Ferrometal company cameras, showing that both southern stays and locally attached road sections at pillar 9 started dropping virtually simultaneously. From the movement of the top crossbeam, the tension cables of the southeastern stay apparently gave way. Immediately, the complete road on the pillar and soon after also the pillar itself fell. However, Autostrade, the company that maintained the bridge, objected that the video still does not show all bridge structures, so it does not really explain the cause.\nAt the time of the collapse, the bridge was managed by Atlantia S.p.A. (formerly Autostrade S.p.A.), a holding company operating toll motorways and airports, which is controlled by the Benetton family. The family waited two days to release a company public statement offering condolences to victims and their families.\nThe disaster caused a major political controversy about the poor state of infrastructure in Italy and raised wider questions about the condition of bridges across Europe.\nAccording to the Corriere della Sera, this was the 11th bridge collapse in Italy since 2013.\nIt was later decided that the bridge would not be repaired, but demolished. Demolition began in February 2019 and was completed on 28 June 2019.\n\n\n=== Victims and rescue efforts ===\nForty-three people were confirmed dead and 16 injured. The dead were 29 citizens of Italy, four from France, three from Chile, two from Albania, and one each from Colombia, Jamaica, Moldova, Peru, and Romania.\nMultiple survivors were transported to nearby hospitals, many in critical condition. Davide Capello, the former goalkeeper for Cagliari, survived without injury and was able to walk away from his car, even though it dropped 30 metres (100 ft) before becoming wedged between parts of the fallen bridge.\nThe area under the remaining part of the bridge, including several homes, was evacuated. As of 02:00 the following day (midnight UTC), 12 people were known still to be missing, and voices could be heard calling from underneath the debris; rescue efforts were continuing by floodlight using techniques commonly deployed after earthquakes.  The number of known dead grew to 43 as of four days after the event.\n\n\n=== Aftermath and reactions ===\nThe railways connecting Genoa Sampierdarena (and Genoa Piazza Principe) with Genoa Borzoli and Genoa Rivarolo were closed immediately as a result of the bridge's collapse. A rail replacement bus service was established between the stations.\nThe day after the collapse, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte declared a state of emergency for the Liguria region, which would last for a year. According to deputy minister of infrastructure Edoardo Rixi, the entire bridge would be demolished.\nThe Italian Football Federation announced that a minute of silence would be held for the victims of the collapse before all football events across the country during the weekend that followed the incident. On 16 August, the Lega Serie A postponed the opening 2018–19 Serie A matches for both Genoese association football clubs Genoa and Sampdoria that were originally scheduled for 19 August.\nItalian transport minister Danilo Toninelli, who had started in office on 1 June 2018, described the incident as \"an immense tragedy\", but it was pointed out that his Five Star Movement political party had said in 2012 that the risk of a collapse of Morandi Bridge was just a silly fairy tale, because \"the bridge would have lasted another hundred years\", quoting a 2009 evaluation by Autostrade.\nGovernor Giovanni Toti said that the loss of the bridge was an \"incident of vast proportions on a vital arterial road, not just for Genoa, but for the whole country\". The disaster resulted in a drop in the stock price of the road's operator, Atlantia, by 5% the same day and by 25% two days later.\nA state funeral was held on 18 August, inside the Fiera di Genova event arena, for 18 victims of the collapse, along with recognition for the firefighters and other rescue workers. Some of the victims' families refused to attend the service and instead hosted private funerals. The funeral was attended by Italian politicians, such as President Sergio Mattarella, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, interior minister Matteo Salvini, transport minister Danilo Toninelli, and the secretary of the Democratic Party Maurizio Martina.\nIn mid-2020, control of the infrastructure company was given back to the government after legislators had reduced the penalty for changing the ownership structure.\nIn 2021 the footbridge immediately next to the Morandi Bridge (previously called Ponte delle Ratelle) was named Passerella 14 agosto 2018.\nVarious criminal charges, up to and including manslaughter, were laid against 59 individuals, many of them employees of Autostrade per l’Italia. The most high-profile defendant was Giovanni Castellucci, chief executive of the company at the time of the collapse. The trial began with an initial hearing in July 2022.\n\n\n==== Infrastructure ====\n\nThe collapse raised concerns about the general condition of infrastructure in Europe, with studies in Italy, France, and Germany suggesting that a significant number of bridges are in need of renovation or replacement due to corrosion and structural deterioration. Infrastructure investment in Italy was reduced dramatically after the 2008 financial crisis. A resident of Genoa told reporters: \"The central government will scapegoat the bridge company, the company will scapegoat someone else — they're all to blame. We all know how bad our infrastructure is in Italy.\"\nThe ruling coalition put pressure on the managers of the road, Autostrade per l'Italia (which is part of the Atlantia group). Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio claimed that they were \"definitely to blame.\" Minister of the Interior Matteo Salvini also blamed European Union budget rules and limitations on deficit and state debt, to which the European Commission opposed a denial. The position of the Benetton family, whose company owns 30% of Atlantia, has also come under scrutiny. Autostrade per l’Italia's chief executive, Giovanni Castellucci, said that the bridge would be rebuilt within eight months.\n\n\n==== Investigative committee ====\nThe investigative committee was to be chaired by Roberto Ferrazza and to have as an expert member Antonio Brencich.  However, these two committee members were immediately criticised for being among the signatories of the February 2018 government report that failed to impose precautionary measures on the weakened bridge. On 23 August 2018, Brencich resigned from the inspection commission, and Minister Danilo Toninelli removed Ferrazza as the chair, for \"reasons of opportunity in relation to all the institutions involved in this affair\".\n\n\n==== NASA satellite data research ====\nScientists from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, developed a method of analyzing satellite data to detect millimeter-sized changes. Their analysis suggests that the deck between pier 10 and pier 11 had minimal movements until early 2015, and that between March 2017 and August 2018, a significant increase in structural changes occurred (noting that the collapsed pier is pier 9, without any consequential damage to piers 10 and 11, and the between deck). The research and imagery were forwarded to the Italian authorities for further evaluation.\n\n\n=== Symbol ===\nA Volvo FM truck belonging to Damonte Trasporti S.R.L. and providing services for Basko Supermercati, painted in blue and green, became a widely publicised symbol of the disaster because it remained standing almost at the edge of the collapsed section. The 37-year-old driver at the time of the accident recounted to the media how he looked in shock as the bridge busy with dense traffic collapsed in front of him, as he brought his vehicle to a stop and ran back until he reached firm ground.\n\n\n=== Demolition and replacement ===\n\nThe last two cable-stayed pillars (10 and 11) of the bridge were demolished using a tonne of explosives on 28 June 2019. The complete bridge was planned to be removed, along with multiple houses in the surrounding area.\nConstruction began on the replacement Genoa-Saint George Bridge, designed by Italian Genoese-born architect Renzo Piano, on 25 June 2019, and it was completed in the spring of 2020. It was inaugurated on 3 August 2020.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of bridge failures\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nPhoto documentation of Ponte Morandi, 8 August 2015\nWebcam of the Ponte Morandi, today\nVideo of collapse\nYelina, Nataliya (5 August 2022). \"Experience: I was driving across a bridge when it collapsed\".

Zabriskie House, also known as the Zabriskie–Schedler House, is located at 460 West Saddle River Road in the village of Ridgewood in Bergen County, New Jersey, United States. The historic frame house was built around 1825 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 22, 2019, for its significance in architecture.\nJohn A. L. Zabriskie was a farmer. After his death in 1864, his son, James Zabriskie, inherited the property. It was later purchased by the Smith family in 1908. Florence Schedler, daughter of Carman Smith, lived here until her death in 2007. The village purchased the property in 2009, with plans to use it as a public park.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Ridgewood, New Jersey\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Bergen County, New Jersey\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Siler niser is a species of jumping spider is endemic to India, It has been proposed the common name glossy jumping spider by the discoverers of the species. The specific epithet is an acronym of the National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER), as the type locality of the species is the institute's campus.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe carapace of a male Siler niser is covered with a mixture of bluish and greenish scales, with blue scales extending below the anterior lateral eyes and running along the rim. The legs are yellow brown with a few interspersed iridescent scales and dark brown longitudinal stripes. The palps are brown. Cymbium, tibia and patella are all covered with white hairs. Abdomen is covered with iridescent scales along anterior, lateral and posterior regions, with the anterior half with a distinct pattern composed of a reddish anchor-shaped mark and four bright blue spots.\nWhile the female's carapace is covered with white and grey scales, lateral margins covered with reddish scales, outer-rim covered with bluish-white scales. The legs retain the yellow brown color of the male but with longitudinal dark brown and white stripes. Abdomen is greyish with a similar, but incomplete pattern as seen in the males. In darker females, the red band is completely black, this perhaps occurs in older females when the scales are lost.\n\n\n== Range ==\nIt is currently known to be endemic to India, it's type locality is National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER), Odisha.\n\n\n== Ecology & Habitat ==\nSpecimens of Siler niser were found in acute vicinity of the ant Camponotus compressus. Individuals were myrmecophagic like of S. semiglaucus. Both sexes waved the first pair of legs in the air, perhaps mimicking the antennae of the ants. This waving behaviour was observed both in the presence as well as in the absence of ants. Individuals are extremely agile and move to the underside of leaves as soon as they detected any external movement.\nType specimens were collected from Hyptis suaveolens and Lannea coromandelica seedling foliage, both about 2 feet above the ground, during the month of May.\n\n\n== Threats ==\nThe type specimen individuals of Siler niser were collected from a grassland-shrubland type habitat. These habitats are under threat as they are often labelled as unproductive and the biodiversity they harbour remains poorly documented.\n\n\n== References ==",

He currently serves as New Zealand's ambassador to the United States and will take up the position of chief executive of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade on 30 June 2024.\nPreviously, Corry served as High Commissioner for New Zealand in the United Kingdom (2020–2022) and New Zealand's ambassador to Thailand (2009–2012).\n\n\n== Early life ==\nCorry grew up in the Taupō–Rotorua area. He is the eighth of ten children to Marie (née Gordon) and John Corry, who was a lawyer and Hong Kong magistrate. Corry studied at Victoria University of Wellington, graduating in 1986 with a Bachelor of Arts with first-class honours.\n\n\n== Career ==\nCorry began his public service and diplomatic career at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1989, working in the Europe division. He was posted to the New Zealand High Commission in Canberra from 1992 to 1995. He was private secretary to foreign ministers Don McKinnon and Phil Goff from 1997 to 2000. While working for McKinnon, Corry was a leading figure in the Bougainville peace process and personally escorted representatives from the Bougainville Transitional Government to Christchurch for peace talks in 1997.\nCorry was posted to New Zealand's United States embassy in Washington, D.C. as a counsellor from 2000 to 2004. Returning to New Zealand, he was appointed director of the chief executive's office and director of the Ministry's Australian division. In 2009, he succeeded Brook Barrington in the post of Ambassador to Thailand which he held until 2012.\nCorry succeeded Barrington a second time in the position of deputy secretary for policy and planning at the Ministry of Defence from 2012 to 2014. He then returned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade as deputy secretary for Australia, Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Africa until 2015, and deputy chief executive for policy until 2020.\nCorry was posted to the London as high commissioner to the United Kingdom from 2020 to 2022 and thereafter returned to Washington as New Zealand ambassador to the United States. \nHe was appointed Chief Executive and Secretary for Foreign Affairs and Trade in March 2024 and will take up that position on 30 June, succeeding acting chief executive Brook Barrington. This was Corry's third application for the position, having been unsuccessful in 2015 (to Barrington's first appointment) and in 2018 (to Chris Seed).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Patrik Kincl (born 21 July 1989) is a Czech professional Mixed Martial Artist competing in welterweight (-77 kg) and middleweight (-84 kg) weight classes. He fought in the most famous European organizations such as KSW, ACB, XFN, and OKTAGON where he won the middleweight championship. Patrik is training in Hradec Králové in Gym All Sports Academy.\n\n\n== MMA career ==\nKincl started MMA at Good Luck Gym in Hradec Králové under coach Jan Voborník. Later, he transferred to the All Sports Academy in Králové-Hradec, where he still works as an active fighter and coach.\nIn the world rankings, Patrik Kincl is among the best placed CZ/SK fighters in the category up to 77 kg and 84 kg, where he is in the top 50-100 fighters in the world.\nIn the KSW organization, where he worked from the end of 2020 to the second half of 2021, he earned the nickname \"The Inspector\".\nThe second half of Patrik Kincl's MMA career so far is lined with title challenges. His first title shot was scheduled for 7 December 2013 in the welterweight division at GCF Fight Night when he challenged Pepa \"Gorilla\" Krále, but the bout did not take place due to an injury to the current title holder. In 2014, he became the interim champion of the Czech organization GCF, when he finished Valid Abdurachmanov by TKO in the first round. Abdurachmanov stepped in as a substitute for Robert Pukač, who was injured and could not fight. Another match in the GCF organization was the main match of the evening, when Hungarian László Soltésze who Kincl knocked out in the first round. Then Kincl signed a contract with the Russian organization ACB (today's ACA). There, after four matches, he was offered a title match with Albert Duraev, but in the end the match did not take place, as the opponent outweighed him by more than 5 kg. Kincl's next much-discussed match took place at the ACB 52 gala, when he finished Arbi Agujev by TKO in the third round. However, the president of the Russian ACB organization disagreed with the result and declared the result invalid. In 2018, Patrik Kincl received a last-minute (\"short notice\") offer from the UFC, where he was supposed to fight Neil Magny, Kincl turned down the UFC offer due to a fight with Karlos \"Terminator\" Vémola at the XFN 11 gala. He lost a heated duel with Vémola to points. The rematch with Karlos Vémola was announced by the XFN organization on 7 June 2019. However, there was no rematch as Vémola moved to the rival organization Oktagon. The XFN organization announced a replacement match on the same date, with Kincl scheduled to face Makhmud \"Mach\" Muradov in a title match. The match Kincl vs Muradov did not take place due to financial problems of the organizer (XFN).\nAt the end of 2019, Kincl signed with the biggest Polish MMA organization KSW, and scheduled a fight with Roberto Soldić for the KSW Welterweight title at KSW 50 in London. The match didn't take place as Kincl stepped out due to an elbow injury.\nKSW rebooked Kincl to fight legendary Michal Materla at KSW 53 on March 21 in Łódź, but the whole event was cancelled due to COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn 19 December 2020, at KSW 57, Kincl finally made his KSW debut against former UFC fighter Tomasz Drwal and knocked him out in the first round. On June 5, 2021, Kincl TKOed Tomasz Romanowski and secured titleshot against welterweight champion Roberto Soldić.\nOn 4 September 2021, he was defeated by Croat Roberto Soldić in the 3rd round. He thus became only the third Czechoslovak representative in the KSW who fought for the title in this Polish organization.\nAt the end of 2021, Patrik Kincl signed a contract with the Czechoslovak organization OKTAGON, and then in February 2022, he won the middleweight title in his first fight under this organization, defeating the interim champion Samuel \"Pirate\" Krištofič on points. He was able to defend the title of middleweight champion in September 2022 against the experienced French fighter Alex Lohoré, whom he finished in the 1st round after a high kick and a subsequent series of hard blows. It was the fastest title defense in the OKTAGON MMA organization up to that time. For the victory over Alex Lohoré, Kincl won the performance of the night.\nTowards the end of 2022, the Kincl vs Vémola rematch was again approaching. This time in the organization OKTAGON MMA. However, the rematch did not take place in 2022 due to Karlos Vémola's health problems. At the end of 2022, Patrik Kincl was announced as a seeded participant in the Tipsport Game Changer pyramid (pyramid in the category up to 77 kg with a shared prize of 1 million Euros), but in the end he preferred a rematch with Karlos Vémola and at the same time a second title defense in the OKTAGON MMA organization in the middleweight category. The long-awaited rematch, for which the entire domestic scene has been waiting for 5 long years, took place in May 2023 at the OKTAGON 43 tournament in an almost sold-out O2 Arena. Here, with the great support of the fans, Patrik clearly defeated his rival on points and successfully defended the middleweight champion belt of the OKTAGON MMA organization for the second time.\n\n\n== Mixed Martial Arts record ==\n\n\n== Boxing record ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Aave Protocol is an open-source, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain and released in 2020. It is one of the largest cryptocurrency liquidity protocols. The Aave Protocol uses smart contracts to automate processes, including distributing funds and handling collateral.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAave Protocol allows anyone with a cryptocurrency wallet to supply and borrow cryptocurrency assets across Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, and other EVM blockchains by posting collateral, without third-party intermediaries such as banks and brokerages. Suppliers share the interest paid by borrowers, who deposit cryptocurrency assets into different liquidity pools. In turn, suppliers can use their cryptocurrency assets as collateral to borrow at stable or variable interest rates. There are currently three versions of Aave, each of which established upgrades to the protocol: V1, V2 and V3.\nV3 introduced lower transaction fees and the ability to operate across virtually all blockchains. This allows borrowers and suppliers to trade in not just cryptocurrencies on the Ethereum blockchain, but also on Layer 2 blockchains that use Ethereum as a settlement layer.\nIn October 2021, Aave reached approximately $28 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL) across multiple chains, including Polygon and Avalanche.\nThe Aave Protocol is governed by AAVE token holders who form the Aave Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). The Aave DAO governs the protocol and proposes, discusses and votes on any changes to the protocol via Aave Improvement Proposals (AIPs).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Aave Protocol was developed and released on Ethereum mainnet in January 2020 by Aave Labs founder Stani Kulechov. Aave means \"ghost\" in Finland, where Kulechov immigrated.\nAave was preceded by ETHLend, also developed by Kulechov, which launched in 2017.\nIn July 2023, Aave released GHO, an Aave-native, decentralized stablecoin. GHO is backed by assets available in the Aave Protocol.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Russell Cook (born 13 March 1997), also known as Hardest Geezer, is an English endurance athlete from Worthing, West Sussex. In April 2024, Cook became the first person to run the entire length of Africa from the southernmost to the northernmost point of the continent as part of Project Africa.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nCook was born in Worthing, West Sussex, attended Vale school in Findon before attending Worthing High School and Worthing College.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 2020, Cook ran from Istanbul, Turkey to Worthing, England in 68 days. Also in 2020, he set the world record for the fastest marathon run whilst pulling a car, in 9 hours, 56 minutes.\n\n\n=== Running the length of Africa ===\nOn 22 April 2023, Cook began Project Africa, planning to run the entire length of the African continent. He began in Cape Agulhas, South Africa, the southernmost point and ended in Ras Angela, Tunisia, the northernmost point on 7 April 2024. The course covered 16,000 km (9,900 mi) and crossed 16 countries. During the run, he had to overcome several challenges including being robbed at gunpoint, food poisoning and being accosted by men with machetes.As part of his endeavour he raised money for the Running Charity, whom offer running and mental health programmes to people struggling, as well as the charity Sandblast who support the indigenous Saharawi population of Western Sahara.\nCook took on the challenge because he had faced mental health issues, gambling addiction, and struggles with alcoholism.Having completed the challenge, the claim Cook was the first to run the full length of Africa was disputed by the World Runners Association (WRA) and Nicholas Bourne. The disputes center on differing routes and semantics.  The WRA agreed Cook is the first to run from Africa's southernmost to northernmost point but claims WRA member Jesper Olsen is the first to run the full length in 2010, running from Taba, Egypt to the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa as part of a world run, while Nicholas Bourne's 1998 run, starting in Cape Town, South Africa and finishing in Cairo, Egypt, was certified by the Guinness World Records in 2000. According to The Independent, \"Mr Bourne said disputes often arise around ultra-running records because there was no governing body to oversee and set criteria for long-distance challenges\". According to Guinness World Records they have no official record for the first man to have run the length of Africa because \"there is no recognised standard for the route, distance or time taken\".\n\n\n== References ==",

Acting Governor Georgy Filimonov is running to a full term in office.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThen-Cherepovets mayor Oleg Kuvshinnikov was appointed acting Governor of Vologda Oblast and was later elected by the Legislative Assembly of Vologda Oblast in December 2011, replacing four-term incumbent Governor Vyacheslav Pozgalyov. Kuvshinnikov resigned early in May 2014 and ran in the special gubernatorial election in September 2014 winning it with 62.98% of the vote. Kuvshinnikov ran for a third term in 2019 and won with 60.79% of the vote.\nOn 31 October 2023 Oleg Kuvshinnikov unexpectedly announced his resignation nearly a year ahead of the gubernatorial election. Deputy Chairman of the Moscow Oblast Government Georgy Filimonov was appointed acting Governor of Vologda Oblast the same day.

        "content": "The Siege of Guimarães was a military siege that took place between the Portuguese separatist forces and the Leonese forces of Afonso VII, who marched into the County of Portugal in 1127, and attacked the Castle and city of Guimarães, the seat of King Afonso Henriques and the Portuguese nobles who had revolted that year against the authority of Countess Teresa.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter the death of Count Henry, his widow D. Teresa took over the government of the county during the minority of her son Afonso Henriques. In 1125, he knighted himself in Zamora Cathedral.\nResentful of Teresa's closeness to her influential lover, the Count of Trastámara, Fernão Peres de Trava, and her favouritism towards the Galician nobility, who supported her plans to reign as an independent queen, in 1127 the Portuguese nobility of Entre Douro e Minho revolted and declared themselves in favour of the infante Afonso Henriques, who was sixteen or seventeen years old at the time.\nFaced with the revolt of the Portuguese nobles, King Alfonso VII gathered his forces and, at the head of his troops, travelled to Portugal in person to restore his aunt to full rule of the county. The king's campaign had the support of Diego Gelmires, the bishop of Compostela, as well as the majority of the Galician nobility.\n\n\n== The Siege ==\nOnce the Portuguese borders had been crossed by Alfonso VII's troops, sieges and battles ensued. The lands of Guimarães, whose castle was the seat of the counts of Portugal, had declared themselves in favour of infante Afonso Henriques and Alfonso VII focused on this castle of central importance, where Afonso Henriques was at the time, and headed there quickly. The end of the campaign would come in Guimarães.\nOnce the city was surrounded and unable to resist, the supporters of King Afonso Henriques decided to ask Afonso VII for peace on behalf of the young infante.\nThrough an agreement negotiated by Egas Moniz, King Afonso VII abandoned the siege without taking possession of the castle, in exchange for a guarantee that the Portuguese nobles would lay down their arms and Afonso Henriques would fulfil his duties as a vassal of León in the future, with Egas Moniz remaining as guarantor. On the one hand, this meant that serious reprisals had been avoided, and on the other, it meant that the revolt had failed, as Queen Teresa remained in government.\nTeresa also suffered reprisals from Afonso VII and lost some lands she had acquired north of the River Minho.\nAfter the order had been restored, and with little interest in the disputes between King Afonso Henriques and his mother (Teresa), after both had recognised the King of León as their suzerain, the latter withdrew from the territory and went back to Galicia.\n\n\n== Consequences ==\nAfonso VII's campaign in Portugal lasted six weeks. It had a profound impact, as resentment grew among the county's society against Teresa and her Galician favourite, who was blamed for the military failure, and those who had previously tolerated the Count of Trastâmara now saw him as an obstacle. Among Afonso Henriques' supporters, however, hope for the future was growing.\nKing Afonso VII was unable to pacify the Portuguese nobles for long. The following year, they rebelled again against Teresa and Fernão Peres de Trava and defeated their troops in the Battle of São Mamede, being driven out of Portugal. Afonso Henriques then took over the reins of the county government.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBattle of São Mamede\nPortugal in the Middle Ages\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "João Inacio De Souza (né Inacio; 2 July 1921 – 1 June 1978) was an Indian theatre actor, composer, singer, playwright, and theatre director who worked on the Konkani stage.\n\n\n== Career ==\nDe Souza, a figure in the realm of Goan musical theater known as tiatr, had a career intertwined with the Mormugao Port Trust (M.P.T; presently referred to as Mormugao Port Authority) in the city of Vasco da Gama, Goa as stated by writer Fausto V. da Costa in the book TIATR 125th Anniversary Commemorative Volume. While there is limited information available about De Souza, his contributions as a playwright and performer are known. De Souza's talent as a tiatrist, or tiatr performer, was evident in his portrayal of various character roles, including those of a landlord (bhattkar), a traditional farmer (kunbi), and individuals belonging to the Hindu community. However, it was his portrayal of a Portuguese police officer or First corporal of the Portuguese Army (Primeiro-cabo) that garnered particular acclaim. De Souza's command of the Portuguese language, authoritative voice, authentic police uniform (fardamento), and distinct style contributed to his excellence in this role. His performances in popular tiatrs such as Nelson Afonso's politically themed Nationalist and the popular Almas de Outro Mundo (Souls from Another World) showcased his memorable depiction of the Portuguese police officer character archetype. In addition to his skills as a performer, De Souza displayed prowess as a composer and singer, specializing in Konkani kantaram (songs). \nDe Souza's musical contributions extended beyond solos, encompassing trios, quartets, and quintets, which solidified his standing as a popular figure in tiatr side-shows. Several of De Souza's compositions, including \"Kazar Borem\" and \"Sukh Bhogxi,\" were recorded by the British record label HMV Records. De Souza was a multifaceted artist known for his contributions as a playwright and director in the realm of tiatr, a popular form of musical theater in Goa. His works encompassed several tiatrs, including Kumpar Mhojer Demand Kela (Lover has demanded me), Sukh (Happiness), and Kednach Polleunk Nam (Never did I witness), among others. Of particular significance was De Souza's theatrical production, Kumpar Mhojer Demand Kela, which served as a pivotal platform for the emergence of Antonio Francisco Fernandes, a Konkani actor and musician professionally known as Tony Sax. The tiatr was overseen by Konkani singer and composer Minguel Rod. Hailing from the city of Sanguem, Goa, Fernandes showcased his skills in this tiatr, leading to recognition from popular figures within the tiatr community. In June 1995, De Souza's impact on the tiatr landscape was further acknowledged when he was among those early tiatrists of the yesteryears who were featured in the 'List of artists that cannot be forgotten,' a compilation by writer and historian Wilson Mazarello, published in 2000.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nJoão Inacio De Souza was born as João Inacio on 2 July 1921 in Vasco da Gama, Goa, which was part of Portuguese India during the Portuguese Empire. He was born to a single father, José Inacio, into a Catholic family who was settled in the city of Vasco da Gama at the time of De Souza's birth. On 1 June 1978, De Souza died in his hometown at the locality of Vaddem in Vasco da Gama, Goa.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nOn 25 July 2012, the Tiatr Academy of Goa (TAG) organized a monthly program entitled \"Somplolea Tiatristancho Ugddas\" at the Black Box, Ravindra Bhavan in Margao, Goa. The purpose of the event was to pay tribute to tiatr artistes who had died and had made significant contributions to the development of tiatr, a form of Goan musical theater. Alongside De Souza, the other popular artists who were remembered during the program were A. M. B. Rose, Aleixinho De Candolim, Domnick Vaz, Carmo Rod, Freddy J. Da Costa, Antonio Moraes, and Thomas Aguelino Fernandes (Peter Champion).  Tiatr artistes John Claro and Tomazinho Cardozo, the former President of TAG, delivered speeches highlighting the accomplishments and artistic contributions of these late tiatr artistes. Additionally, Socorro de Santa Cruz, a tiatr performer, performed some of the songs composed by the deceased artists.\nOn 25 July 2018, the Tiatr Academy of Goa (TAG) organized a special program called \"Somplolea Tiatristancho Ugddas\" at the Black Box, Ravindra Bhavan in Margao. The primary objective of the event was to honor deceased tiatr artistes who were born in the month of July and to recognize their significant contributions to the field of tiatr.

        "content": "The Danish Campaigns to Novgorod (Danish: De danske korstog i Novgorod; Russian: Датские походы на Новгород) were a series of Crusader raids in 1241 by Danish royals and vassals, using the Duchy of Estonia as base of operation, against the Novgorod Republic. The Danish Crusades were supported and executed in coordinance with the papacy and other Crusading states, notably Sweden and the Livonian Order, the former one not being able to send further support after being defeated at the Neva.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nSince 1169, Denmark had continuously sought to establish a Danish empire over the Baltic Sea's coasts. In 1223, Denmark controlled the coastline from Lübeck to Pomerelia, and made a foothold in Estonia. Yet the same year, the Danish king, Valdemar II, was abducted by his own vassal, Henry of Schwein. This led to a domino effect, in which all Valdemar's possessions renounced their vassalage to him, and the Danish Baltic Empire definitively ended in 1227 at Bornhöved.\nThe Livonian Order took advantage of a weakened Denmark and seized the control in the Duchy of Estonia in the same year. This, among with other factors, led the order to be too powerful for the pope, and in 1238 he initiated the Treaty of Stensby, which returned all of Estonia (except Järva) to Denmark. Additionally, Denmark would receive one third of all future conquests in the region.\n\n\n=== Papal ambitions and prelude ===\n\nThe ambitions of the papacy were to expand ecclesiastic control in the east. Papal letters to Scandinavian archbishops commanded the preachings of Crusades against their pagan neighbours. Haakon IV of Norway was attempted to be recruited for a Crusade in 1241, yet he rejected. Still, Denmark under Valdemar II the Victorious, Sweden under Birger Jarl and the Livonian Order, were all in for a Crusade. Novgorod was the main focus for the campaign, since it was a strong bastion for the Russian Orthodoxy and overall posed a serious threat to catholic presence in the Baltics. The Swedes were defeated in the Battle of the Neva, yet this did not stop the Danes and Germans, who launched their own campaign the year later. The Casus belli, being that prince Alexander Nevsky, was so proud of his victory at the Neva, that he started to offend Novgorod's nearby enemies. This gave the Danish and German knights an excuse to further conquests into Orthodox territory.\n\n\n== First Crusade ==\nA few months after the Swedish attack, a force, led by Abel  of Schleswig, consisting of 300 Danish and German knights, supported by an additional greater number of Estonian troops, attacked the Votians in winter 1241. The city of Koporye was occupied and a stone castle was erected to secure the territory. This move was done in order to cut off Novgodrodian access to the southern side of the Bay of Finland, which would greatly damage their economy and international trade. Further to the south, the villages of Tesov and Sablia were also captured, which only lad 30 km from Veliky Novgorod. It is reported in the Novgorod First Chronicle, that the Votians suffered greatly from the campaign.\n\n\n=== Death of Valdemar II ===\nDespite the initial successes, the campaign would come to an end in March. Back in Denmark, king Valdemar had layed ill and died. This led to a succesion crisis in Denmark, over the question of who should succeed Valdemar. Duke Abel therefore suspended his campaign in Novgorod and returned to Denmark to assert his claim on the throne.\n\n\n== Second Crusade ==\nMeanwhile, the king's vassals were led with the defence of Estonia for themselves. They participated in campaign, launched by Andreas von Felben with an army of 1000. The army was allied with Jaroslaw Wladimirow, a former prince of Pskov, who was in exile amongst the Crusaders. The Crusade intented to secure Pskov for Jaroslav and the Catholic Church and their first target was the Novgorodian fortress of Izborsk.\n\n\n=== Battle of Izborsk ===\nA battle for the fortress was quickly started, and the Dano-German army took the fortress. A 600-man force from Pskov continuesly tried to recapture the fort, yet was defeated by the Crusading army. The Livonian Rhymed Chronicle recalls the event;\n\n\"Those from Pskov were unhappy about the news (capture of Izborsk). This is the name of a neighboring town in Rus' whose inhabitants were extremely evil. None of them stayed behind but rather all participated in the expedition and grimly stormed Is- borg, with many bright cuirasses and helmets shining like glass. There were many crossbowmen among them. When they came upon the Brothers' army (the Teutonic Knights) they attacked and the Brothers and the (Danish) King's men boldly charged towards them. The Germans hacked great wounds and the Rusins suffered terribly. Eight hundred of them fell on the battlefield.... The others took to flight and were pursued relentlessly....\"\nThe Crusader army then marched on Pskov, which was left defenseless. The Crusaders camped outside of Pskov for a week, burning villages and Orthodox monasteries, including their books and icons. With a reduced defense and a defeat at Izborsk, the mayor of Pskov, Tverdilo Ivankovich, opened the city gates and surrendered the city to the Crusaders.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\nIt had become clear to Novgorod, that the Crusaders (besides trade) were also interrested in conquering new territories. As a response to the fall of Pskov, Alexander Nevsky reassumed power. The newly arrived prince took the Novgorodian city militia and set out for the occupied Votians, and retook the Crusader castle of Koporye. Danish and German prisoners from the fortress were sent to Novgorod. Nevsky, along with his brother, Prince andrey of Suzdal, now appeared outside of the Crusader occupied Pskov and quickly stormed the city. The Novgorodians then crossed the Velikaya and began burning and pillaging the Crusader territory. In response, the Crusaders raised an army in Livonia and Estonia, under Hermann von Buxhoevden, and met the Russians at the Battle on the Ice.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBattle of Julin Bridge – Polish/Danish naval/land war\nValdemar II of Denmark – King of Denmark from 1202 to 1241\nCanute, Duke of Estonia – Danish noble, Duke of Estonia\nBattle on the Ice – 1242 battle of the Northern Crusades on the frozen Lake Peipus\nSecond Swedish Crusade – Military conflict\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "La Orquesta was a Mexican newspaper published biweekly in Mexico City from 1861 to 1877. It gained a reputation for its caricatures, creating a \"lively, animated, and personal\" genre.\n\n\n== History ==\nIts direct predecessor, Mi Sombrero, was created in 1860 by Carlos R. Casarín, who collaborated with Luis Ponce and Constantino Escalante, Casarín's cousin. Both edited the short-lived Mi Sombrero. In March 1861, La Orquesta was founded by Casarín—who utilized the pseudonym \"el ciudadano Roberto Macario\"—and Escalante. It was edited by Manuel C. de Villegas, and published by the Imprenta de la Paz del Callejón de las Cazuelas in Mexico City. The three, along with painter Hesiquio Iriarte, were the owners. The publication sold every Wednesday and Saturday, and was the first Mexican newspaper to outlast its foundation year.\nDuring the Second French intervention in Mexico it suffered multiple periods of inactivity. One such instance was in 1866, when it was briefly substituted by El Impolítico under the direction of José María Casasola; El Impolítico was published five times. In June 1867, La Orquesta resumed publication under Vicente Riva Palacio, who utilized the pseudonym \"Juan de Jarras\", a character from his first novel, Calvario y tabor.\nIn September 1877, it ceased publication.\n\n\n== Staff and collaborators ==\nFrom 1861 to 1872, it had about 17 editors-in-chief. Some included Casarín, Escalante, Hilarión Frías y Soto, Riva Palacio, and José R. Pérez. Cesarín was the founding editor and remained in the position for under a year. Escalante succeeded him, serving from late 1861 to early 1862. Then Frías succeeded him.\nColumnists included Antonio Carrión,  Juan N. Berra, Ignacio Gazaluz, Juan Darío de Sais, Lorenzo Elízaga, Luis Gonzaga Iza, José R. Pérez (possible pseudonym of Ignacio Ramírez), Vicente Riva Palacio, Francisco Pimentel, Juan Antonio Mateos, Juan de Dios Arias, and Frías y Soto, among others; and cartoonists Escalante, who used the pseudonym \"Tolín\", Santiago Hernández, José María Villasana, and José Tiburcio Alamilla. Literary and poetic figures published included José Puig Caracena, José María de Salas y Quiroga, José M. Esteva (who dedicated a sonnet to Juan Díaz Covarrubias), José Selgas y Carrasco, Anselmo de la Portilla,  Guillermo Prieto, Francisco Zarco, and Florencio María del Castillo, among many others.\n\n\n== Editorial Line ==\nLa Orquesta sought to revindicate liberal principles and the freedom of press, in a moment where the Congress of the Union affected press laws and suspended individual guarantees. Its principal objective was to mock the governmental decisions of Benito Juárez and his ministers, particularly Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada. Commonly criticized were the financial administration, bankruptcy from poor implementation of the Reform Laws, the Second French intervention, and the Second Mexican Empire of Maximilian.\nThe attacks against Juárez's administration was scathing in its editorials, like in its caricatures, which employed the physical deformation of people through the era's archetypes. Animalization of physical traits was predominantly used by Escalante, Hernández, and Casarín to ridicule the political class. For example, cats referred to the entanglements of politicians, crabs regression to the conservative regime, and flies waste and foul odor. Escalante initiated the use of caricatures and in 1872 he was succeeded by Hernández as head of their production.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===",

        "content": "The Two Tickets Puzzle is a 1930 detective novel by the British author Alfred Walter Stewart, published under his pseudonym J.J. Connington.   It was the second and last book featuring Superintendent Ross, an attempt to replace the author's better-known series character Sir Clinton Driffield who returned in Connington's next novel The Boathouse Riddle. With its story of a police detective trying to break down an alibi using railway timetables, it resembled the style of Freeman Wills Crofts' Inspector French series. Dorothy L. Sayers used a similar plot for her 1931 novel Five Red Herrings, and references Connington's novel in the dialogue.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nA mean-spirited businessman Oswald Preston is discovered shot dead under the seat in an empty compartment of a railway carriage. While there seems to be several people who potentially bore him a grudge including his wife, his ward, a former employee and his wife's alleged lover a prominent local doctor. Yet it is almost impossible to see how anyone could have committed the murder while the train was in motion between two stations. Ross and his men set about a lengthy, painstaking task of checking all the train tickets of those passengers travelling on the train. Eventually, the work pays off and they are able to unmask the murderer and give chase as he attempts to escape.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBarzun, Jacques & Taylor, Wendell Hertig.

        "content": "Tell el-Maschuta (Arabic تل المسخوطة Tell el-Mashūta, ) - the ancient Egyptian Per Tem/Pi-Tem - is located in the Wadi Tumilat region in the eastern Nile Delta about 16 kilometers west of Ismailia and about 18 kilometers east of Tell er-Retaba. \nThe use of the site was subject to constant change. Originally founded in the 16th century BC as a settlement of around two to three hectares, Tell el-Maschuta was re-founded at the end of the 7th century BC as a trading center and place of worship of the deity Atum (Tem), which was associated with the naming of Per Tem (Atum) in Tjeku under the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Necho II. Herodotus mentioned the \"Arab city of Patumos\" located in this region in connection with the canal construction begun by Necho II. In Hellenistic times, Per Tem probably bore the name Heroonpolis; however, this is not certain. The name Ero, which originated in Roman times, is the short form of Heroonpolis.\nEarlier results of archaeological research initially led to the assumption that Tell el-Maschuta was the biblical Pithom. For example, Per Tem was also mentioned on the recovered statue of Ankhkherednefer, from which numerous historians inferred a connection to the cult of the deity Atum in Heliopolis, the biblical On. The Pithom stele from the Ptolemaic period shows that the old name Per Tem was still in use as a place name for Tell el-Maschuta several centuries after Necho II.\nAt the beginning of the 2nd century AD, the function of Tell el-Maschuta changed again and it now served as a Roman cemetery. Since the beginning of the 5th century AD, Tell el-Maschuta has only been a mound of ruins. From 1977 onwards, it was archaeologically examined several times during excavation campaigns.\n\n\n== Etymology and research history ==\nIn earlier times, the site was called Ahou Kachah or Abou Keycheyd. A monolith was found there on which Ramesses II is depicted between two sun deities. Archaeologists therefore suspected that an ancient Egyptian city was located at the site, with the sand-covered monolith as a typical identifying feature.\nArchaeological teams identified the site as Pi-Ramesses, the \"place of the Israelites during their oppression\", due to the Ramesses monolith. The supposed discovery prompted numerous archaeologists to intensify their research and excavations at \"Pi-Ramesses\" around 1860. However, further investigations led to the conclusion that it was not Pi-Ramesses.\nWork on the Bubastis Canal was completed at around the same time. After the workers and archaeologists left, the interest in the Mound of the Monument, for which the modern translation Mound of the Damned/Heroes is also used, initially faded.\nIn 1883, Édouard Naville undertook another campaign in this region on behalf of the Egypt Exploration Society and discovered the ruins of Tell el-Maschuta. He examined the existing monuments, statues, inscriptions and building remains and drew up a ground plan of ancient Tell el-Maschuta. However, Naville did not examine the numerous pottery fragments and other small finds in the strata (horizontal excavation layers). In his final report, he came to the conclusion that it must have been the biblical Pithom, as the excavated objects included several monuments from the time of Ramesses II.\nThe French Egyptologist Jean Cledat carried out further investigations in the Wadi Tumilat region between 1900 and 1910 and was able to recover additional finds. John S. Holladay and his team initiated extensive excavations as part of the Wadi Tumilat project initiated by the Canadian University of Toronto. Five excavation campaigns took place from 1978 to 1985. More recently, research commissioned by the Egyptian Antiquities Authority has provided further information about Tell el-Maschuta.\n\n\n== Archaeological studies ==\n\n\n=== First colonization phase ===\nThe excavations prove that Tell el-Maschuta was founded in the 16th century BC at the end of the Second Intermediate Period (1600 to 1550 BC) by the Hyksos (immigrants from the Near East). The name of the village at that time has not yet been determined. The small village resembled an outpost, as there were no special fortifications. The shape of the curved city walls used at this time is characteristic. There is evidence of a continuous increase in burials and the construction of above-ground circular silos during the construction phase of Tell el-Maschuta. The tombs showed striking differences in terms of the status of the buried persons. Warrior burials included the Asian-style weaponry typical of this period, such as daggers and chisel-shaped axes. The other mud-brick graves contained numerous valuable grave goods such as gold or silver headbands and silver-decorated bracelets, earrings and hair rings, gold and silver scarabs, tools and semi-precious stones, as well as amulets and food. In contrast, children's graves and burials in the disused round silos only occasionally included grave goods.\n\nBased on the palaeobotanical analysis of the finds, the archaeological team of the Wadi Tumilat project concluded that Tell el-Maschuta fulfilled all the criteria of an urban settlement, but was only inhabited seasonally from the beginning of the sowing season in autumn until the end of the summer wheat harvest in spring. Due to these characteristics, Tell el-Maschuta had the character of a caravan station that was set up for long-distance trade. During the hot summer months, Tell el-Maschuta remained uninhabited. During this period, the inhabitants probably settled in the vicinity of Tell er-Retaba, where residential camps existed in the Middle Bronze Age. The materials used for the construction of Tell el-Maschuta show parallels to the finds in strata E1 to D3 of Avaris. Dwellings were built closer and closer together. The extent of agriculture, primarily the cultivation of wheat and barley to supply the inhabitants, increased considerably. Cattle, sheep, goats and pigs were also kept. Horse breeding was also already known. Other activities of the inhabitants included hunting several species of birds, hartebeest and gazelles.\nThe workers employed in agriculture were also used for other activities, such as pottery and the production of bronze tools. They also used looms, made clothing and used sickles with prefabricated blades. The exact purpose of the high-temperature ovens found during the excavations is unclear. Ochre-colored piles were driven into the ground in an industrial-like process. It is possible that the ovens were used for the production of leather with metal fittings as well as anvils or grinding tools. The final examination of the pottery found revealed that after the expulsion of the Hyksos by Kamose and Ahmose I, the settlement fell into disrepair and remained uninhabited for at least the period from the New Kingdom to the end of the Third Intermediate Period (1550 to 652 B.C.).\n\n\n=== Second colonization phase ===\n\n\n==== Saite dynasty from Necho II onwards (610-525 BC) ====\nTell el-Maschuta was not re-founded until the end of the 7th century BC, not far from Tell er-Retaba. During this time, Necho II ordered the construction of the Bubastis Canal between 610 and 605 BC in order to connect the Pelusian branch of the Nile with the Red Sea. The new canal led through the Wadi Tumilat and was expected to bring Egypt strategic and agricultural advantages.\n\nThe newly constructed site of Tell el-Maschuta initially served as a camp for the workers involved in the construction of the canal. A short time later, Apis bulls were sacrificed there and facilities were built for what would later become the Temple of Atum. Houses, barns and ovens were built to the north of the temple. In the midst of this construction phase, sudden changes are recognizable, probably due to Nechos' defeat at Carchemish in 605 BC and the loss of his territories in Retjenu. Shortly afterwards, a fortification wall about nine meters wide was erected around Tell el-Maschuta, enclosing an area of 200 m × 200 m. Settlement nevertheless came to a halt, as the protected area was not used for further construction of houses during the Saite dynasty.\nThe community on an area of four hectares was destroyed in 601 BC and then a second time 15 years later. Prior to this, the Egyptian Pharaoh Apries, in alliance with Zedekiah, had failed in his attempt to prevent the capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar II. The devastation can therefore be attributed to the Babylonian king. Two pieces of Jewish pottery from 568 BC were found in Tell el-Maschuta, which testify to the presence of Jewish refugees in Tell el-Maschuta around 582 BC. Larger quantities of similar pottery turned up at Tahpanhes, located about 22 km from the mouth of the Pelusian Nile River, and at a site in the western Sinai region tentatively identified as Migdol.\n\nAfter the destruction and reconstruction, Tell el-Maschuta developed into a highly frequented trading center during the Saite dynasty under the pharaohs Apries, Amasis and Psamtik III. The reason for this may have been the central location between the Mediterranean and Red Sea as well as the trade connection to the Indian Ocean, especially as Tell-el-Mashuta was also roughly halfway between Suez and Bubastis. The archaeological evidence of large quantities of Phoenician trade goods is consistent with Herodotus' statement that numerous Phoenicians settled in a \"Phoenician camp near Memphis\" during the reign of Apries:\"Then the kingdom came to a man in Memphis, whose name was Proteus in the language of the Hellenes. He now has a sanctuary in Memphis, which is very beautiful and well furnished and is situated towards the south of the temple of Hephaestus. The Phoenicians of Tyre live around this sanctuary and this whole place is called the 'camp of the Tyrians'.\"\nHerodotus, Histories, 2nd book, 112Phoenician trade, which took on increasing proportions through the use of the Bubastis Canal, is documented by numerous finds of Phoenician amphorae in Tell el-Maschuta. The amphorae were used as storage containers for trade goods. Further evidence is provided by a terracotta statue found in the ruins of a limestone shrine, which probably represents Tanit or Asherah as a seated goddess. Greek amphorae were represented in smaller numbers, mostly from Thasos or Chios. There were also imported thick-walled mortars and the accompanying pestles, probably of Anatolian origin.\n\n\n==== First Persian dynasty from Cambyses onwards (525-404 BC) ====\nThe conquest of Egypt in 525 BC by Cambyses II was accompanied by the renewed destruction of Tell el-Maschuta at the Battle of Pelusium. Subsequent reconstruction work at the site is well documented. The settlement area, which had already been extended during the Saite dynasty, was used for new buildings during the Persian period with an expansion in the south-western area. In the northern part of Tell el-Maschuta, there is evidence of an area that served as a necropolis south of the temple district in the Persian period from the end of the 6th century BC to around 404 BC at the Bubastis Canal.\nAfter his ascension to power, Darius I extended the Bubastis Canal to a total length of 84 kilometers. Darius I had his achievements inscribed on four large stelae, the first of which was located in Tell el-Maschuta, in Egyptian, Old Persian, Elamite and Akkadian. In the course of the Egyptian rebellion against the Persians, which began in 487 BC, another stone wall was built outside the city wall of Tell el-Maschuta, which was filled with rubble, pottery and other materials. The archaeological findings provide evidence of the battles for Tell el-Maschuta associated with the rebellion. In the period that followed, warehouses were again erected throughout the area. After the Persians were driven out of Egypt in 404 BC, the strata were uninhabited until around 379 BC.\n\n\n==== The last independent ancient Egyptian dynasty (379-341 BC) ====\n\nFragments of monuments from the 30th Dynasty are evidence of the enormous building program of the pharaohs Nectanebo I and Nectanebo II, who also brought about a short-term \"renaissance\" for Tell el-Maschuta by promoting the ancient Egyptian religion. With the recolonization, trade and the import of goods increased dramatically during the 30th Dynasty, although the Bubastis Canal slowly dried up.\nThe trade revived by the Phoenicians focused mainly on wine, olive oil, fish sauces and other durable foods. More distant regions such as Thasos, Chios and Anatolia also took part in the exchange of goods, as did Arabia and Athens in particular. The temple cult of the Egyptian god Atum experienced a new heyday, as evidenced by the cuboid altars made with South Arabian influence. The existing ink inscriptions on glass fragments were mostly written in demotic script. The use of incense, which was also imported from southern Arabia, is documented as part of the sacrificial acts for the temple of Atum.\nThe accidental discovery of a storehouse containing thousands of Athenian tetradrachms caused quite a commotion. The unusually large sum indicates that they were donated as gifts to the temple of Atum. In addition, four bowls were discovered whose style and design suggest a Persian origin and probably came to Tell el-Maschuta via southern Arabia. All four bowls bore similar inscriptions, with one of the bowls bearing the Aramaic entry \"That which Qaynu, son of Geshem, king of Qedar, offered for Han-'Ilat\". This Geshem may be identical to the figure of the same name in the Book of Nehemiah in the Old Testament. The inscriptions on the bowls and additional silver coins found, which show the owl of Athena on their reverse, are dated to the transition from the fifth to the fourth century BC. The end of the 31st dynasty, which was replaced by Alexander's conquest of Egypt, led to an exodus of the inhabitants of Tell el-Maschuta, followed by a period without settlement until around 285 BC.\n\n\n==== Reconstruction of the temple of Atum and construction of trading houses (285 BC to 1st century BC) ====\n\nAfter his reign began, Pharaoh Ptolemy II (285 to 246 BC) began to desilt and renovate the Bubastis Canal, which was associated with a modernization programme for Tell el-Maschuta. As a result of the extensive construction work, the site once again developed into an important trading post. Ptolemy II had his project inscribed and celebrated on a stele that he erected in Tell el-Maschuta.\nNumerous large limestone blocks from other places in Egypt were transported to Tell el-Maschuta for the reconstruction of the Atum temple. A two-room building from the Persian period, which had already fallen into disrepair, was used as a pottery after reconstruction. In addition, probably towards the end of the reign of Ptolemy II, there were up to six-room granaries or multi-room warehouses on the banks of the Bubastis Canal. Several furnaces for the production of bronze goods for the Atum temple and for export were connected to these.\nThe trading houses and warehouses discovered by Édouard Naville and assigned to the \"Children of Israel\" probably date from the early days of the construction program under Ptolemy II, as only these were located in the immediate vicinity of the smelting furnaces on the banks of the Bubastis Canal. Ptolemy III (246 to 222 BC) and his successors must have initiated further extensive construction of trading houses and workshops, as the Wadi Tumilat project was only able to excavate a small number of the numerous trading houses, some of which were up to 75 m long, during its campaigns. The trading houses explored so far could be dated to the period between the second half of the 3rd century BC and around 125 BC. After the end of Ptolemaic rule, Tell el-Maschuta experienced a decline, so that the site lost its main function as a trading post at the beginning of the 1st century BC and was therefore once again abandoned by its inhabitants.\n\n\n==== Tell el-Maschuta as a Roman necropolis ====\n\nAfter the inhabitants left Tell el-Maschuta at the beginning of the 1st century BC, the site fell into disrepair. The site remained unused until the beginning of the 2nd century AD. When Trajan expanded the Bubastis Canal again after his reign, the region of Tell el-Maschuta functioned as a Roman necropolis and underwent the largest expansion in terms of area since its foundation under the Hyksos. There was no new settlement, however, as numerous tombs were erected on the ruins of the former trading center. Previous smaller excavation campaigns had already partially uncovered the Roman cemetery, which is why the archaeological team from Toronto did not carry out any further intensive investigations at this site, but was able to confirm the large quantities of pottery found in the upper stratum.\nThe findings revealed that the necropolis was mostly built for \"privileged Roman citizens\" and consisted of square underground tombs with vaulted superstructures. These mud-brick tombs also had an access path or walled dromos, which allowed access to the burial chambers on the eastern side of the tombs. The vaulted burial passages, which only had a simple access path, were walled up after each burial. The relatives of the grave owner, on the other hand, filled the dromos with sand. Gold-plated figurines of gods, earrings, glass vessels and hairpins made of bone were used as grave goods. Some of the valuable grave goods in the tombs were already looted during their active use as a necropolis.\n\nThere were also simple burials that were embedded in the open space between the mud-brick tombs without any special additions of statuettes of gods. Most of the burials exhibited the typical forms of Roman style, which can also be seen in the symbolic orientation of the graves. The necropolis also had a burial area for children. A Christian child burial is noteworthy in this context. In the upper part of an amphora from Gaza there was a Coptic inscription with two \"Chi-Rho symbols\" as Christ's monogram, which had been used by Christians since the 2nd century AD to represent their faith and to recognize each other. However, this form of burial was only found on very few burial objects.\nIn the early 4th century AD, Tell el-Maschuta was abandoned as a Roman necropolis, as evidenced by the absence of the decorated grave illuminations. Around 381 AD, the existence of a Roman \"garrison of heroes\" stationed in the region of Tell el-Maschuta is attested, but at this time it was located in Abu Suwerr, only about two kilometers away, which retained its military function and is now home to a military air base.\n\n\n== Identifications with the biblical Pithom or Sukkot ==\nFor some time now, there have been controversial discussions about the question of whether Tell el-Maschutah should be identified with the Old Testament Pithom or Sukkot. Édouard Naville believed that his excavation findings confirmed his assumption that it was the \"children of Israel\" who built the \"trading houses\" at Tell el-Maschutah. Kenneth Anderson Kitchen, on the other hand, considers Tell el-Maschutah to be the biblical Sukkot, where the Israelites camped on their exodus from Egypt. Kitchen still stands by his hypothesis that both Tell er-Retaba and Tell el-Maschuta coexisted as settlements in the New Kingdom, without, however, taking into account the pottery findings of John S. Holladay's archaeological team. Donald B. Redford, on the other hand, agreed with Holladay's findings and sees Tell el-Maschuta as the biblical Pithom, which was only built 600 years after the Exodus from Egypt.\nThe references to Sukkot in the Pentateuch (Ex 12:37, Num 33:5-6) remain unclear and leave open whether it is a city, a village, a fort or a region. The \"building of the city of Pitom\" mentioned in Exodus 1:11 is also difficult to reconcile with the past of Tell el-Maschuta. In light of the excavations, those historians who judged the story of the Exodus from Egypt to be fiction or saw it as an anachronistic additional account that was only included in the scriptures around the 6th century B.C.were therefore vindicated.\nDetailed examinations of the ancient Egyptian papyri show that the name \"Tjeku\", from which the Hebrew equivalent \"Sukkot\" is derived, almost always referred to a larger area in the 19th and 20th dynasties and was only written once with the city determinative. \"Per Tem\" or \"Pi-Tem\" as an ancient Egyptian term for \"House of Tem\" referred to a temple of the god that \"lay in Tjeku\". This means that there is no longer any basis for a fixed place name for \"Pithom\" as the \"House of Tem\". For these reasons, Alan Gardiner had already spoken out long ago against equating Tell el-Maschuta with Pithom or Sukkot. Since the excavation findings prove beyond doubt that Tell el-Maschuta no longer existed during the Ramesside period, the ancient Egyptian papyri reports cannot have referred to Tell el-Maschuta and must therefore refer to a different place. Some of the monuments and statues found in Tell el-Maschuta date either to the 9th century BC or to the Ramesside period. This finding, as well as the other excavation results, prove that Tell el-Maschuta can therefore be ruled out as the \"site of the Exodus from Egypt\" or as the \"Pithom near Pi-Ramesses\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBonnet, Hans (2000). \"Pithom\".

        "content": "Fort Albany was a Hudson's Bay Company trading post established in 1679 near the site of the present day Fort Albany First Nation. The fort was one of the oldest and most important of the Hudson's Bay Company's posts. It was also involved in Anglo-French tensions leading to the Battle of Fort Albany in 1688.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area was explored by Charles Bayly, the first overseas governor of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), around 1675, and the original Fort Albany was established in 1679. The fort was named in honour of Henry Stuart, 6th Duke of Albany.:39 It was one of the original Hudson's Bay Company trading posts, the others being Moose Factory on the south shore of James Bay, Charles Fort (later Rupert House) on the east, York Factory in the Port Nelson region, and New Severn (aka Fort Severn).:21 In these early days of the company, each fort was run by a governor, who served for a number of years and oversaw the company employees, managing the trade of their fort.:22\nThe original fort was built inland from the mouth of the Albany River, partly for defense, and moved several times. Ships from England had to lay at the river mouth at Albany Roads. In 1683, Governor Henry Sergeant was directed to make it the primary trading post of the Hudson's Bay Company; it was the largest fort on the Bay at that point, with four bastions and forty-three guns.:51 In 1684 a Monsieur Péré reached the fort from French Canada. He was arrested and his two companions were sent to Charlton Island. In 1685, the French built Fort des Français at the juncture of the Albany and Kenogami Rivers to block the indigenous people from coming north to trade with the HBC.\n\n\n=== Nine Years' War ===\nIn 1686, all three posts on James Bay (Moose Factory, Rupert House, and Fort Albany) were captured by an overland expedition from Quebec. Fort Albany was named Fort Saint-Anne by the French. In 1688 the English sent ships to reestablish their posts but were defeated by French ships that had come to re-supply the forts. In 1693 the English retook the fort and held it thereafter.:52 By the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick, Albany was to be returned to the French, but nothing was done before the war resumed in 1702. In 1709 the French tried and failed to capture the fort. In 1713 the Treaty of Utrecht gave Hudson and James Bays (along with the rest of Rupert's Land) to the English.\n\n\n=== Expansion of the fur trade ===\nFollowing the end of decades of conflict with the French, sloops from Albany traded along the east coast until a new post was built on the Eastmain River in 1723-24 and Moose Factory was reestablished in 1730. By 1771, one ship serviced Albany, Moose Factory, and the East Main sub-house on the east shore.:112\nDuring the 18th century, trade between the Cree and the Hudson's Bay Company continued. In the 1720s and 1730s, 50% of the value of all trade to the Cree at Fort Albany was arms, while cloth and blankets accounted for approximately 25%. This pattern had reversed by the 1780s, when arms accounted for less than 25% and cloth and blankets more than 75% of the trade to the Cree from Fort Albany. By the 1790s, the Cree were using European cloth to make jackets and other clothes, which had acquired ceremonial and practical significance.:49\nAround the mid-1700s, the company's policy was to primarily engage in trade with indigenous people at their forts on the coast. By 1743, Chief Factor Joseph Isbister had found that trade at Albany was being undercut by coureurs des bois that had established trading posts upriver from the fort. So, going against company policy, he took a team 160 miles up river to establish the subsidiary Henley House and re-establish HBC authority. This policy officially changed in the 1770s, and the company began establishing series of inland posts that fed into the coastal forts and factories, which would function as depots for storage and ports for trade back to Europe. According to a report by long-time company factor Andrew Graham, by 1771, around the time of the change in policy, Fort Albany was staffed by 30 men in addition to the chief factor and his officers, and oversaw the sub-houses Henley House and East Main, each with eleven men governed by a sloop master.:111\nAnother official policy of the company was to not allow any of the indigenous people they traded with into any forts. This policy, relaxed by Chief Factor George Spence (1747-1752), was strictly enforced by Chief Factor Joseph Isbister when he returned to the fort in 1752. This sudden removal of access to Fort Albany and Henley House angered Wappisis, a Cree man influential over the indigenous people of the area, and in December 1754 he and a few others destroyed Henley House, killing the five HBC men there and raiding the stores, threatening death to anyone that told the Company people that they had done it. Wappisis went to Albany in May 1755 to trade and attempted to blame \"French Indians\" on the destruction of Henley House. Isbister heard in June from another indigenous person that Wappisis had done it, and Isbister hanged Wappisis and his two sons on June 21, 1755. The employees at Moose and Albany were concerned following the destruction of Henley House, since this was the first such incident of indigenous violence in the company's history. Henley House was re-established under Chief Factor Humphrey Marten by 1768.\nIn 1777, Gloucester House was built 243 miles upriver from Henley House and in 1786, Osnaburgh House was built at the outflow of Lake St. Joseph. This westward expansion significantly increased the trade of Fort Albany. In 1793, the Governor of Albany Fort established posts on the Rainy River and Winnipeg River. Posts supplied from the HBC-run Fort Albany competed with North West Company men from Lake Superior and even HBC posts supplied from York Factory, until the union of the two companies in 1821.\nFort Albany was the headquarters of the Albany District of the Hudson's Bay Company, which, as of 1830, bordered Severn District to its northwest, Moose District to its southeast, the far western reaches of Upper Canada to its south, Lac La Pluie District to its southwest, and Winnipeg District to its west. The east-flowing Albany River drew furs from as far west as Lake St. Joseph. From there, a portage ran west to Lac Seul, the English River, the Winnipeg River and beyond. A north-flowing branch, the Kenogami River led upstream toward Lake Superior at Wawa, Ontario and another branch, the Ogoki River led toward Lake Nipigon.\nFollowing the 1821 merger of HBC with the North West Company, Albany District thrived, recovering from the decline in trade caused by competition while the supply of fur-bearing animals dwindled. In order to curb the extinction of fur-bearing animals, the Governor of Rupert's Land George Simpson established beaver preserves throughout the district.\n\n\n=== Land transfer to Canada ===\n\nIn 1868, the Hudson's Bay Company surrendered their North American territory known as Rupert's Land to Great Britain, which then gave it to the newly-formed Dominion of Canada with an 1869 \"deed of surrender.\" Following this transfer to the Dominion, the province of Ontario engaged in litigation, arbitration, and negotiation to define its northern and western borders. In 1878, arbitrators granted Ontario territory north to the English and Albany rivers, causing Fort Albany to become part of the province. The Canada (Ontario Boundary) Act, 1889 officially expanded the province of Ontario north to Albany River and west to Lake of the Woods. At the suggestion of magistrate E. B. Borron, Ontario initially allowed the old HBC regime to manage the territory, until the province was able to more substantially take on its management, which began by appointing HBC officers as justices of the peace.\n\n\n=== Treaty No. 9 ===\nIn 1905, Treaty 9 was signed by the Indigenous people living around Fort Albany, who had become concentrated in the area over the past few decades and who had been seeking a binding agreement with the government to protect their way of life. The signature of this treaty marked the legal creation of Fort Albany First Nation.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Chief Factors of Fort Albany\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The  Hiratsuka Kawazoe Site (平塚川添遺跡, Hiratsuka Kawazoe iseki) is an  archaeological site with the traces of a late Yayoi to early Kofun period settlement, located in the Hiratsuka neighborhood of the city of Asakura, Fukuoka Prefecture in Japan. It was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1994.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Hiratsuka Kawazoe Site is located in the western part of present-day Asakura City, near the eastern edge of the Chikushi Plain. The Koishihara River, a tributary of the Chikugo River, flows to the west of the ruins, and the ruins are located on a slightly elevated area of about 20 meters above sea level in the Koishihara River basin, on the western edge of the Fukuda Plateau. The Sada River, also a tributary of the Chikugo River, flows to the east of the ruins. The area around this site is an allluvial plain formed, and there are several ruins from the same period in the vicinity, including the Hiratsukayama no Kami ruins in the northeast.The Hiratsuka Kawazoe Site was discovered in 1990 during the construction of the Hiratsuka Industrial Park. The remains include multiple ring moats, the foundations of about 300 pit dwellings, and the remains of about 100 buildings with buried pillar foundations, all within an area of approximately 17 hectares. The area was occupied for approximately 300 years, from the middle of the Yayoi period to the early Kofun period, and it is estimated that by the late Yayoi period, around the 2nd or 3rd century, it had become a large village surrounded by a water moat.  This is thus contemporary with the period of the Civil War of Wa mentioned in the ancient Chinese text  Wajinden of the Wei Zhi (ca. 297), which is part of the Records of the Three Kingdoms.The village contains an oval-shaped central area of about 220 meters north-south by 120 meters east-west (two hectares), surrounded by an inner moat, which contains the foundations of a large buried pillar building. Outside this central area, buildings appear to have been grouped in small clusters surrounded by a double ring moat. Furthermore, on the western lowland opposite the plateau, there are three or four moats, and it is thought that the village had a total area of over 400 meters from north-to-south and 250 meters from east-to-west.Between the ring moats, there were more than six sections created by bending parts of the moat significantly outward. The area to the southwest of the center, outside the inner moat, is a warehouse area consisting only of buildings with standing pillars. On the north side of this section, there are pairs of postholes on both slopes of the inner moat, which are thought to be piers leading to the center. On the other hand, in the area northeast of the center, outside the third moat, there was a group of pit dwellings in the center, and groups of buildings with standing pillars were discovered to the east and west of these. To the west is a moat-standing pillar building with an oval moat around it, resembling the remains presumed to be the site of a bronze casting workshop at the Suku Okamoto Ruins and Suku Nagata Ruins in Kasuga, Fukuoka. In this area, a large amount of unfinished wooden utensils and planks were unearthed, as well as a large amount of unfinished wooden utensils and planks, as well as wooden utensils. It can be assumed that this is the residential and working area of a group of workers. Furthermore, a piece of a bronze spear mold that was used as an anchor stone was discovered in a pit dwelling on the north side of the center near this area.\nIn addition to everyday Yayoi pottery, artifacts include metal items such as bronze spears, bronze arrowheads, bronze mirror fragments, beads, and Chinese coins, as well as wooden items such as agricultural tools, building materials, and fishing gear, but no iron items have been unearthed. Plants found include reeds, grapes, alders, yew, Japanese oaks, Quercus serrata, and bayberry.The site has been developed in the Hiratsuka Kawazoe Archaeological Park (平塚川添遺跡公園) from 2001, with reconstructions of various buildings.  It is located one kilometers from Kamiura Station on the Nishitetsu Amagi Line.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Hirazuka Kawazoe Archaeological Park at Wikimedia Commons\n\nCultural Properties in Fukuoka Prefecture (in Japanese)\nFukuoka Tourism \"Crossroads Fukuoka\" home page(in Japanese)\nAsakura City home page(in Japanese)",

        "content": "Tanele Maseko is a Swazi human rights activist and the widow of the prominent human rights lawyer and democracy activist Thulani Maseko. Following her husband's assassination in 2023, Maseko has become a prominent campaigner both with regards to continuing her husband's activism promoting democratic reform in Eswatini, and also by calling for an independent investigation into his death, for which she has received harassment and intimidation from Swazi authorities.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMaseko was born in KaLuhleko, Bhunya, Manzini Region. Maseko married Thulani Maseko in 2008. They had two children together and lived in Luyengo, near Mbabane.\n\n\n== Activism ==\nMaseko's husband Thulani rose to prominence as a democracy activist, in addition to his work as a lawyer for minority and disadvantaged groups in Eswatini. Thulani had been imprisoned for contempt of court between 18 March 2014 and 30 July 2015 after writing an article in The Nation raising concerns about judicial independence and integrity in Eswatini. During her husband's imprisonment, Maseko wrote an article for Amnesty International about her experiences as the wife of a prisoner of conscience.\nOn 21 January 2023, Thulani was assassinated while watching television at home with Maseko and their two children by unknown individuals. Maseko's killing occurred hours after Mswati III, the King of Eswatini, made public comments warning human rights activists in the country not to \"shed tears\" about \"mercenaries killing them\". Maseko gained greater prominence following her husband's death, becoming the major face of the Justice for Thulani campaign. In July 2023, she stated that she had not received any updates from the police since the immediate aftermath of Thulani's killing, and accused the police of treating the investigation as a cold case.\nMaseko established the Thulani Maseko Foundation to continue her husband's legacy, including campaigning for democratic reform in Eswatini and a transition away from absolute monarchy. Maseko also became the deputy director of the Southern Defenders, a regional human rights network in southern Africa. Maseko made public comments critical of Mswati III; in October 2023 during a talk with the Oslo Freedom Forum in Taipei, she criticised the President of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen, for making a state visit to Eswatini and maintaining diplomatic ties with the Swazi government despite its oppression of Swazi people.\n\n\n=== Harassment campaign and arrest ===\nIn December 2023, while accepting a posthumous award for her husband at the Magnitsky Human Rights Awards in London, she accused Mswati III of being a dictator who had ordered the killing of her husband due to his human rights activism. Local independent media outlets in Eswatini reported that Maseko was being targeted and monitored by state authorities and that her life was potentially in danger. On 29 December 2023, a Swazi government spokesperson, Alpheous Nxumalo, released a statement on X dismissing the reports, while also making derogatory remarks about Maseko, including accusing her of being on \"a global charade to cash in on her husband's death\", of contaminating the crime scene immediately following Thulani's death, and of misrepresenting comments made by Mswati III concerning his stance on human rights activists. Nxumalo's comments were condemned by human rights organisations and activists including the Human Rights Foundation, the Southern Africa Human Rights Defenders Network, the Swaziland Multi-Stakeholder Forum and Maxwell Nkambule.\nOn 27 March 2024, Maseko and her children were stopped at the South Africa-Eswatini border between Oshoek and Ngwenya when attempting to cross back into Eswatini. Immigration officials reported that Maseko's passport had been flagged as belonging to a wanted person; local police officers subsequently confiscated Maseko's passport and phone, and interrogated her for four hours at the Manzini Regional Police Headquarters before releasing her pending a further interview to be held the following day in Mbabane. It was initially reported that Maseko's wanted status was linked to the investigation into her husband's death.\nOn 28 March, Maseko's interview with police officers in Mbabane was halted after her lawyers challenged the legality of the police's refusal to permit them to be present. During her time in the station, activists from the Swaziland Rural Women's Assembly protested outside against Maseko's arrest. As of 29 March 2024, the police have not released information about why Maseko was specifically identified as being a wanted person by Swazi authorities. Lydia Dlamini, the acting Eswatini Police National Commissioner, stated that Maseko needed to be interviewed due to her being the only witness to her husband's murder, and accused her of not co-operating with the police.\nRegional and international human rights organisations including African Defenders, the Southern Africa Litigation Centre, the Centre for Human Rights at the University of Pretoria, Human Rights Watch, and Amnesty International condemned the targeting and detention of Maseko, and called on the Swazi government to focus on carrying out an independent and transparent investigation into Thulani Maseko's death. Human Rights Watch described the harassment of Maseko by Swazi authorities as an attempt to dissuade her from pursuing \"justice and accountability\" for her husband's murder, while Amnesty International accused the government of weaponizing the criminal justice system to target Maseko.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The tapestry cartoons of Francisco de Goya are a group of oil on canvas paintings by Francisco de Goya between 1775 and 1792 as designs for the Royal Tapestry Factory of Santa Barbara near Madrid in Spain. Although they are not the only tapestry cartoons made at the Royal Factory (other painters of this factory were Mariano Salvador Maella, Antonio González Velázquez, José Camarón and José del Castillo), they are much the best known. Most of them represent bucolic, hunting, rural and popular themes. They strictly adhered to the tastes of King Charles III and the princes Charles of Bourbon and Maria Luisa of Parma, and were supervised by other artists of the factory such as Maella and the Bayeu family. Most are now in the Museo del Prado, having remained in the Spanish Royal collection, although there are some in art galleries in other countries.\nAfter a fruitful career in his native Aragon, the renowned court painter Francisco Bayeu got his brother-in-law to go to Madrid to work on the decorative works for the royal palaces. By then, Anton Raphael Mengs was the most prominent artist at the court after Tiepolo's death in 1770. It was this employment at the court that most satisfied the ambition of Goya, and which would eventually make him the most fashionable artist for the wealthy class of Madrid. Between 1780 and 1786 he left this commission to spend his time as an artist in other private activities.\nThe tapestry cartoons are structured in seven series, each with a different number of works and subject matter. A common feature in all of them is the presence of rural themes and popular entertainment. Only the first one shows themes related to hunting.  Once finished, the cartoons were woven into tapestry and placed in the piece for which they were intended in the royal palaces.\nIn 1858 they went to the basement of the Royal Palace of Madrid, where some were stolen in 1870. That year Gregorio Cruzada undertook the task of cataloging them and showing them to the public in the museum. They appeared for the first time in the official catalog of the institution in 1876. However, some small modellos (painted by Goya for the approval of the subjects) were in the hands of the Dukes of Osuna, whose descendants auctioned them in 1896. At that auction some paintings were bought by the Prado and others by collectors such as Pedro Fernández Durán and José Lázaro Galdiano, remaining in Spain.\nGoya was able to grow as an artist and raise his social status through these pieces, which made him a sought-after painter in high circles in Madrid. In 1789 he obtained the position of Pintor de Cámara de Carlos IV —the former Prince— and years before he was admitted to the Academia de San Fernando.\n\n\n== Context ==\n\nThe year was 1774 and Goya was twenty-eight years old when his father, Javier Nieto, died recently. Born in Fuendetodos, a town near the Aragonese capital, one of his greatest ambitions was to settle in Madrid, the capital of the kingdom, a city that was modernizing by leaps and bounds due to the efforts of the Bourbons, a dynasty that, despite having been in power for only 70 years, had already consolidated itself completely.\nTwice Goya has tried to be admitted to the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando, but on both occasions the paintings he attached to his application were rejected. But the painter was able to travel to Italy, the great cultural center of the time. It was then that he painted his first great historical painting: Hannibal Seeing Italy from the Alps. However, he did not do well in the competition and decided to return to his homeland, where he undertook the famous paintings of the Cartuja del Aula Dei.\nGoya marries Josefa, sister of the wealthy Bayeu painters. Some time later his brother-in-law Francisco was able to obtain a position at the court for the novice provincial painter, perhaps following orders from Mengs.\nTomlinson notes that between April and December 1774, Goya was decorating the Charterhouse of Aula Dei, so he did not join the group of painters in Madrid until well into 1775. Rapelli categorically rejects this theory, stating that the Aragonese settled in the Spanish capital in December 1774.\n\nThe painter will find himself in the capital with an extremely large court of artisans and painters. The Royal Tapestry Factory of Santa Barbara is the center of artistic activity. The bohemian Mengs will sometimes direct Goya's work, and in his very long absences the first architect of the court, Francisco Sabatini, will do so. Occasionally Bayeu himself and Mariano Salvador Maella, another outstanding cartoon painter, would take on this role.\nUntil 1780 he painted four series of cartoons, but that year the economic crisis forced the suspension of the supply of cartoons for the royal estancias. Then Goya decided to give his career another turn. Perhaps the desire  —fueled, no doubt, by the study of his life and work — to emulate Diego Velázquez, leads him to make his way as a private painter. He returns to his homeland in Aragon and paints the dome and pendentives of the Regina Martyrum of El Pilar, which will bring him into conflict with his brother-in-law Francisco and the town council of Zaragoza. In Madrid he worked as a portrait painter for high society, especially for the Dukes of Osuna. He also managed to paint for the church of Saint Francis the Great the painting Saint Bernardine of Siena Preaching before Alfonso V of Aragón and to enter the Academy of San Fernando with his best known religious work, Christ Crucified, a magnificent fusion of Velazquez's style with that of Mengs. Shortly thereafter he met the infante Luis de Borbón, brother of the king and exiled from the court as a result of his morganatic marriage. The prince became his patron and introduced him to aristocratic circles. It is very likely that Goya decided to return as a tapestry painter after the death of his protector in 1785.\n\nIn 1786 Goya returned to the factory and painted cartoons that already denoted verism (The Snowstorm and The Wounded Mason). In the last series he painted, elements were foreshadowed —the groom with a simian face in The Wedding— that the Aragonese painter would later depict in his Caprichos.\nSix years later, in 1792, Goya suffered an illness that would be the turning point of his career. He would never return to his former work as a cartoon painter, and now undertook works of a more personal nature. However, he will paint other works for the court, such as Charles IV of Spain and His Family.\nHagen evidence Goya's rise from a simple provincial painter to a full-fledged court artist. In 1786 Goya acquires his first carriage and is already a sought-after painter. He describes to his friend Zapater a trial trip, from which it is inferred that he enjoys an excellent economic situation since he belongs to the Academy of San Fernando and is about to become the King's Painter.\nJosé Gudiol, one of the first experts in the work of the master of Fuendetodos, affirms that in Goya the indelible imprint of the courtly world and the grace of the popular world, which always alternated in the painter's mind, are mixed.\nJeannine Baticle, another of Goya's great scholars, points out that Goya becomes \"the faithful heir of the great Spanish pictorial tradition. In him, shadow and light create powerful volumes built in the impasto, clarified with brief luminous strokes in which the subtlety of the colors produces infinite variations\".\n\n\n=== Spain at the time ===\n\nThe death without descendants of the last Spanish Austria, Charles II, caused a long war between the European powers that culminated with the recognition of Philip of Anjou as king of Spain under the name of Philip V. This, grandson of the Sun King, introduced French fashion in Spain, and brought Gallic artists such as Hyacinthe Rigaud and Louis-Michel Van Loo to work in the Peninsula.\nFrom the 1730s onwards, the presence of Italians at the Madrid court became more notorious, due to the fact that Philip V's second wife, the Parmesan Isabella de Farnesio, had a great preference for the culture of the Italic Peninsula. Jacopo Amigoni and Gianbattista Tiepolo would be the most prominent Italians in Spain, but under Charles III the luck would change in favor of the Bohemian Mengs. After the death of the latter, no more foreign painter would be called to Spain, what Tomlinson (1993) calls \"nationalization of Spanish painting under Charles III\".\nIt is feasible that this nationalization of art is strongly rooted in the open hostility of the Spanish people towards foreigners, derived from the failure of the Seven Years' War. This whole movement culminated in the Motín de Esquilache, with which the enlightened Spaniards gradually displaced the French. Two examples of this were Aranda and Floridablanca.\nIn 1782 there was a brief attempt to put the tapestry factory in the hands of Spanish craftsmen. But the king rejected the painters' requests and handed over the management of the workshop to a Fleming named Vandergoten, supposedly a relative of the family that had founded the factory more than six decades earlier.\n\n\n== Dating and attribution ==\nThe seven series of tapestry cartoons are composed, in total, of between 60 and 73 works. Some authors, such as Rapelli, date the paintings at 63.\nJuan Ramón Triadó Tur has established in his monograph on the Prado Museum an exact number of 60 cartoons, although this figure may well refer only to the number of works of this series preserved in the Madrid art gallery.\nThe three leading specialists in Goya's cartoons, Nigel Glendinning, Valeriano Bozal and Janis Tomlinson, are inclined to date the series between 1775 and 1792. Considering the aforementioned six-year interval, this would result in twelve years of Goya's work at the Royal Tapestry Factory.\nThe size and motifs of the cartoons were intimately related to their hierarchy and the place assigned to them in the royal room. They can, therefore, be divided into panels —the most extensive compositions, which would occupy the largest space and would delimit the theme of the entire series— and other smaller cartoons destined for over doors or balconies. A letter from Goya to his friend Martín Zapater details a meeting with the sovereign and the princes in 1779, where it is stated that only the sketches for the main scenes were shown. This could explain the serious stylistic discrepancies between the main subjects and the smaller cartoons. Some authors attach great importance to the fact that the series projected in 1787 and 1791-92 were never hung as Goya had agreed.\n\nThe dating of the cartoons has not been the subject of much discussion, since the Royal Factory kept detailed records of the works, which remain to this day. However, there is a serious dating conflict for Blind Man's Bluff. Critics of the stature of Bozal and Glendinning affirm that it was made in 1789, but Tomlinson rejects this theory and proposes that it was completed before 1788, since the series to which it belonged was left unfinished when Charles III died —on December 14, 1788— and in April 1789 Goya received the longed-for appointment as painter of the chamber, so his activity in the field of cartoons would diminish drastically. The small reference guide to Goya's works in the Museo del Prado, written by Manuela de Mena, records Blind Man's Bluff as having been painted between 1788-89.\n\nNor has it been determined to which series belong The Swing and A Stickball Game. Although most critics prefer the former bedroom, Tomlinson argues that they were painted for the bedroom of the princes in El Pardo. Other paintings that have provoked debate for their location in the series are Boy with a Bird, Boy and a Tree and Majo with Guitar. In this area of dating, it has been complicated to determine whether The See-Saw is a tapestry cartoon, because although Tomlinson decides in the affirmative, another part of the specialized critics refuses to take the attribution as part of the cartoons.\n\nAs Tomlinson points out, it is beyond doubt that Goya painted the tapestry cartoons. However, there have been some incidents surrounding that issue. The most notorious example has been Cats Fighting, discovered in the basement of the Prado in the 1980s. Since it bears no relation to Goya's other cartoons, especially to the series to which it has traditionally been attributed —the fifth—, it has been seriously doubted that it is the work of the Aragonese. Moreover, it does not have the same stylistic features as other works of the period.\nAnother of the paintings with doubtful dating is Chicken Fights, which Bozal assumes as part of the seventh series, dedicated to the king's office in El Escorial, as well as the official page of the Prado Museum.\nUsually some of the paintings for the alameda of the Dukes of Osuna are taken as part of the cartoons for tapestries, with characteristics and themes extremely similar to those of the cartoons, although with a different technique. The best known case is The Fall, a country scene. Another case to highlight is A Picador, painted around 1795, but the chronological proximity of this piece with the cartoons causes many scholars to think that it is part of a series.\n\n\n== Technique ==\n\nTapestries are weavings made in a similar way to carpets, which by combining threads of different colors and tones allow, as in a mosaic, to visually recreate real images.\nThe cartoons were a very precise sketch, in color and real size, of the motif that the weavers had to reproduce. These paintings owe their name of cartoon to the fact that they were usually painted on that material and not on canvas or board. The choice of such a humble support is explained by the fact that these models or patterns were not valued as autonomous works of art, and their conservation was not mandatory. The tapestries obtained were usually framed or embedded in the walls, although, as Tomlinson (1993) indicates, many times this task was not carried out and they were simply hung.\nThe loom is the most precise instrument for weaving a tapestry and its base is the warp. It is a set of parallel threads in a longitudinal direction on which the scenes of the cartoons are drawn. The making of the tapestry is a very slow task and it is carried out through two types of looms. In the high-warp loom the cartoon is placed behind and the weaver uses a mirror to handle the work with greater dexterity. The low-warp looms allow greater speed because it is done on the front side of the piece, and also greatly reduces the cost of the work because they do not match the quality of the tapestries woven in high-warp.\n\nThe Royal Factory began its work with low-warp looms, but seven years later Antoine Lainger —from the Gobelinos factory— installed high-warp looms. In this way, works of better quality and fineness were achieved. 1727 is considered the peak year for tapestry in Spain.\nA document from 1790 describes in detail the process of making cartoons. Measurements were taken of the room, mainly the walls, and sent to the director of the factory. Most of the clients asked for cartoons with country, jocular, allegorical themes, and only a minority requested cartoons with historical allusions.\nIn the specific case of Goya's cartoons, the weavers of the Royal Factory filed complaints against the Aragonese for the detail with which he made the sketches, especially that of The Meadow of San Isidro (1788). This sketch, of a pre-impressionist character, has such a large number of minute details that it was impossible to convert it into a tapestry. Craftsmanship restrictions were imposed in this case and thanks to this situation, together with the death of Charles III, the work remained only a sketch.\n\nIn The Fair of Madrid, the three central characters of the composition receive a strong luminous impulse. But in the tapestry more details were necessary —contrary to what would happen years later with The Meadow of San Isidro— and the luminosity of the original painting had to be scattered. The tapestry lost part of the essence of the sketch. In The Kite, a painting with a pyramidal structure, the colors of the jacket of the man in the foreground changed from reds to ochers and yellows. In 1780 Goya painted the sketches of The Washerwomen and The Tobacco Guards, which do not include some of the details found in the final paintings, but appear to have been drawn by Goya in collusion with the principal weavers.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nNo point of agreement has been established regarding the number of series that made up the tapestry cartoons. Bozal (2005) favors four series, as does Glendinning (2005). Again Tomlinson debates, designing a chronology of seven series, as he divides those proposed by Bozal and Glendinning. The Museo del Prado in its official guide tries to reconcile the three sources by establishing a chronology of five series of cartoons.\nThe following is a brief description of each series, according to the scheme proposed by Glendinning and Bozal:\n\nFirst series, hunting themes for the dining room of the princes of Asturias in El Escorial.\nSecond series, popular amusements and country leisure for the Royal Palace of El Pardo.\nThird series, the seasons of the year and other scenes of social scope, destined to the dining room of the princes and the bedroom of the infantas of Spain in El Pardo.\nFourth series, games and cheerful aspects of Spanish society. Elaborated for the office of the new king, Carlos IV, at El Escorial.\n\n\n== Analysis ==\n\n\n=== Overall ===\nWhen Goya arrived in Madrid, Charles III, like his son Charles, was a hunting enthusiast. The court had itinerant headquarters, as the king wished to spend most of his time outside the capital and at the royal sites set aside for hunting activities. In the Monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial the king's family resided from September to December, so it was necessary to fit out rooms that once belonged to the servants for the members of the royal family. But it was also necessary to decorate the rooms with tapestries and this led to the hiring of new painters for the Royal Factory, such as Goya. Meanwhile, at the Palace of El Pardo —about fifteen kilometers distant from Madrid— the court was housed from January 7 to Palm Sunday. Charles III doubled the size of the site and added an eastern wing to the palace complex. It was here that many of Goya's tapestries were hung, and he delivered four series of cartoons to adorn El Pardo.\nDespite the fact that painting cartoons is not a work that left great fame for the painter, many specialized authors consider that Goya tried to reach the social summit through the cartoons. He could introduce himself in the capital, and more importantly, in the Court. Years later, he was able to present his designs directly to the king and princes, and even kiss their hands. Thus, from being a simple provincial painter, he became one of the most renowned artists of the Court.\nIn the royal rooms, where the tapestries were hung, good taste and the strict observance of artistic norms prevailed. The Aragonese mixed Tiepolesque rococo with the neoclassical art brought to the top by Mengs. The scenes must also have charm and variety in the themes. In spite of not being works of full realism, there are works in the series that overflow with verism, as in The Injured Mason or Poor Children at the Well.\nUntil then, the master from Fuendetodos had only worked on religious scenes. It was necessary to move away from the late baroque that these paintings expressed, and also from rococo, in order to obtain a piece \"from life\". Neoclassicism, so much in vogue during the decades prior to the execution of Goya's first cartoons, was not the most appropriate way to transmit the vivacity of a popular scene, such as those of children playing —who were sometimes aristocrats in disguise, in order to escape from their hieratic existence—. Picturesqueness required that the atmosphere, the type, the style, the landscapes and the scenes should be everyday and contemporary to the spectator, like a scene of daily life. They should also have a certain atmosphere of amusement and entertainment, which would arouse curiosity and would not distract the client's interest. The realism that the painting should possess would capture the motif by individualizing it, as the characters of costumbrista art are, on the contrary, representative members of a whole.\n\nIt is natural that Goya should have painted hunting scenes for the Princes' dining room at El Escorial, a palace famed as one of the best known hunting grounds at court. Not surprisingly, the second series dealt with matters of country leisure, very appropriate for a dining room. In this case, his cartoons of Dance on the Banks of Manzanares, The Picnic and Boys Picking Fruit stand out.\nBut the fact that they were intended for royal rooms does not exclude the presence of violent scenes, which were an integral part of Spanish life at the time. Goya introduces dramatic notes in the series that will be the archetype for some of his engravings. Quarrel in the New Tavern is a violent scene that contrasts with the tranquility of cartoons such as The Parasol and The Picnic.\n\nA new style, which Mengs commented on in his Letter to Pons, appears, and Goya is one of its first exponents. Known as Lo Sublime Terrible, his contemporaries praised the force with which the Aragonese painter posed these themes. José Moreno de Tejada expressed this vision in a poem of 1804, where he refers to The Snowstorm as a \"painting that seemed to him not only sublime but capable of expressing sadness and even terror through the landscape\". But since his works were intended for royal rooms, Goya could not develop paintings that would fully receive the appellation of Sublime. The cartoons that include details with large crowds of people (The Meadow of San Isidro) could be an appropriate vehicle for developing the Sublime style. However, it is the minimal space they occupy that prevents them from delving into the elements of this style.\nAccording to Glendinning, many times Goya's main idea for the cartoon was modified to suit the looms and even the taste of the princes. Goya had to prepare several times a straight tapestry according to the current conventions, as in The Young Bulls and The Kite, but not in The Parasol.\n\n\n==== Themes ====\nBucolic and hunting themes flood the compositions planned by the Aragonese for the Royal Factory. Unlike the court of the Habsburgs —especially Philip IV—, the Bourbons did not want scenes from the past but popular, country scenes that could represent how life was lived in Spain at the time.\nGoya abandoned the religious and historical motifs with which he had worked in Zaragoza. In his first cartoons he was closely supervised by Bayeu, which is why these works are impregnated with his style. Hunting and fishing are treated in this first series, as they are the great hobbies of Prince Charles. This is consistent with the description of \"popular scenes\" that art scholars have given to the cartoons.\nFor the next series, Goya would adapt the scenes to the taste of Princess Maria Luisa of Parma, who wished to see tapestries with country scenes, the amusements of the majos and, in short, the joyful and amusing atmosphere of 18th-century Madrid. Hagen (2004) states that this was because the princess could not mix freely, as she wished, among the lower classes due to her very high rank.\nA common motif in Goya's cartoons is childhood. Children Blowing up a Bladder, from the second series, is a covert homage to the work of Pieter Bruegel the Elder and also to some themes in German literature. According to Tomlinson, Goya had altercations with the weavers because of the inclusion of two men in the background of this cartoon, who would be virtually impossible to bring to tapestry. Despite this, the painting is the first example of the brevity of the children's fun and joy, a constant ideal in Goya's work. Another of the paintings with an allusion to childhood is Boys Picking Fruit, strongly related to another painting from a later series, Boys Climbing a Tree. The cartoon includes a metaphor related to the state of the fruit: if it is ripe, great sensual satisfaction will be obtained; if it is rotten, the effort will have been in vain. This allegory was expressed by Diego de Torres Villarroel in La fortuna varia y loca.\nThe majos are common in Goyaesque art. Maja and Cloaked Men is the most faithful representation —and perhaps a tribute— to the way of being and living of the majos, who a few months earlier had led a revolt against the prohibition of the cape and brimmed hat.\nThe Frenchification in Spain is evident after the arrival of the Bourbons. It is possible that the precedents of the neoclassical painters influenced Goya in his second series. The Parasol shows a young woman dressed in the Spanish style but with a Gallic hairstyle. It is also possible that it is a maja, but the most accepted hypothesis recognizes a young woman at the peak of beauty, at fifteen years of age and when they begin to consider marriage. The same approach to French art can be seen in another classic work of cartoons, The Blind Man's Bluff.\n\nAlthough the Aragonese painted only cheerful subjects for the royal palaces, in his last series of cartoons one can guess the verism that he would use in later paintings, such as The Charge of the Mamelukes or Los fusilamientos del tres de mayo. The Snowstorm completely abandons the theme of country amusements and shows peasants suffering the inclemencies of winter. From the same year dates The Injured Mason, which refers to the pain and suffering of the lower class, but at the same time alludes to a decree issued by the king protecting artisans from the misfortunes that could befall them.\nTwo of his last cartoons —The Wedding and Straw Man— reveal the satirical character of the author. The first is a scathing criticism of arranged marriages. In a village, a beautiful young woman is married to an old man with a simian face. It may even be a precedent of Los caprichos. While in Straw Man, a painting of a rural nature, the women have fun playing with the doll that represents a man. In the sketch, the man was shown with his head high and fallen at the end, like a helpless victim. In short, it is a symbolic game full of evil that could allude, like Chicken Games, to the change of ministers in Spain at the time.\n\n\n==== Style ====\n\nThe style of Goya's cartoons often reflects his aspirations and pretensions to obtain a higher social status. The new style of the cartoons can be appreciated from 1786, when Goya returned to the factory, already a reputable artist with a high social status. The academic, almost neoclassical style of Amiconi and Tiepolo strongly influenced the Aragonese, especially in the series of the four seasons.\nAfter being named painter of the chamber by Charles IV in 1789, Goya obtained even more prestige, which was reflected in his art. In those years he completed The Meadow of San Isidro. In spite of being an appropriate frame for sexual insinuations, the painter refuses to do so because the cartoon would be destined for the bedroom of the little infants. Likewise, the allegorical and metaphorical nature of his works of this period makes the last series of cartoons more inclined to human folly than to other details of royal taste.\n\nAs we have already seen, Goya's cartoons often resort to depicting popular life in Madrid, and also show the gradual Frenchification of the city, as it dresses and adopts the customs of the neighboring country. Despite the very strong rejection of the Gauls —popularly known as \"gabachos\", to this day—, the Spanish, not only the people of Madrid, even accepted a French ruler at the dawn of the 18th century. But the delicate balance that would be established in the second half of the century would be definitively broken in the War of Independence, with which the romantic ideal of the search for a national identity would gain strength.\nGlendinning points out that many of Goya's early compositions use a pyramidal scheme, such as The Kite, The Drinker and The Blind Guitarist. A faithful admirer of Velázquez, the Aragonese artist used a strong and decisive brushstroke that often caused problems for the weavers. He accentuated the details of light, the master left aside the shadows and broke the existing balance between the two most important elements of the pictorial composition. It is known that Goya's way of working prevented the realization of a first version of The Blind Guitarist, so the painter was forced to substitute a man with a cart for a leaning tree and a fisherman. The same thing happened three years earlier with Hunting Party, where Goya had to radically change the location and the color of the hunter's jacket in the foreground.\n\n\n==== Influences ====\n\nIn his early years, Goya had been a pupil of the master José Luzán, one of the most reputable painters in his native Zaragoza. Although not many references to this artist can be found in his paintings, one of the most notable is in The Meadow of San Isidro.\nItalian art, which Goya had been able to study during his trip in 1771, left its mark on some of the tapestries. Tomlinson (1993) notes that the works of the two leading Italian painters of the time, Tiepolo and Amiconi, may have inspired several of Goya's cartoons. The academicist rigidity, used especially in mythological and historical subjects —like Tiepolo's works—, was combined with the delicate and fine rococo art to give rise to some of Goya's most famous cartoons. Italian Baroque also influenced Goya, in works such as Hunter and his Dogs and Shepherd Playing a Pipe. Both are related to some drawings by Italian engravers that Goya may have met during his travels in Italy. Caravaggio painted The Cardsharps, whose scheme and tonalities Goya reproduces in Card Players.\nRococo is the style of all Goya's cartoons except for The Snowstorm, The Injured Mason, Poor People ar the Fountain and their respective sketches. The painter used a palette of warm tones, reinforced by touches of impasto, a style that gave Goya the possibility of creating his own pyramidal scheme. Thus, he placed the main characters in the foreground, the environmental beings behind a mound and in the background a well-worked landscape. The main features of rococo that can be admired in Goya are: vivacity, immediacy, curiosity, chromatism of soft pinks, gauzy textures in the skirts of the women, a luminous background landscape, etc.\n\nThe Parasol is the work most closely related to French painting. Tomlinson and Baticle point out as prototype of the painting the works The Concert, by Boucher, and the engraving Près de vous belle Iris by Lancret, by Horthmals, of which a print is preserved in the Royal Palace of Madrid that could have been studied by Goya. Other feasible hypotheses point to the influence of The Finding of Moses, by Charles de La Fosse and The Wild Boar Hunt, a fine allegory of Europe by Joseph Parrocel; in both the detail of the umbrella appears. On the other hand, the Frenchman Jean Ranc was a painter at the court of Philip V, but before going to Spain he painted Vertumnus and Pomona (Musée Fabre of Montpellier), which Goya must have known through a print. The taste for Ranc at court must have spurred the Aragonese to paint The Parasol.\nOther paintings by Goya may have been inspired by Fragonard's Love Letters and Michel-Ange Houasse's Women at the Fountain. The latter is preserved in the royal collections of the Royal Palace of Madrid. It is highly probable that it was seen by Goya, who would take it as an example for Young Women with Pitchers.\nThe literature of the time was of great importance to Goya in the creation of some of his works. The Fair at Madrid and The Picnic are illustrations of sainetes by Ramón de la Cruz, a well-known comedian. Leandro Fernández de Moratín, a friend of Goya's, was interested in the theme of the unequal marriage depicted in The Wedding. Finally, The Tobacco Guards deals with a subject that Francisco de Quevedo and the Count of Villamediana liked, who composed sonnets about it. There is even a parallelism with the much-used theme of the lazarillo, in The Drinker.\nThe Swing and The Young Bull could represent a passage written by Nicolás Fernández de Moratín, Leandro's father, in his clandestine poem Arte de las putas:\n\nRegarding the largest painting of the last series, The Wedding, Bozal explains the particular transition from the rococo that impregnated most of the cartoons to an accentuated neoclassicism, which Goya would bring to its peak at the dawn of the 19th century. The painter had already tried to take his art from rococo to neoclassicism, as evidenced by The Meadow of San Isidro.\n\nIn The Quail Shoot, as in all the paintings of the first and some of the second, the imprint of Mengs — pyramidal composition— and Bayeu —vivid colors and naturalistic figures— who directed Goya's works, is revealed. Some court cartoonists, such as José del Castillo, simultaneously influenced these early works.\nWilliam Hogarth was an English painter characterized by his strong representations of childhood, models repeated by Goya in The Blind Guitarist. It is the only evocation of English painting found in his cartoons. The Woodcutters and Majo with Guitar respond to similar works by Zacarías González Velázquez and Ramón Bayeu, although the latter showed a greater superiority to Goya in his composition.\nThe imprint of Bartolomé Esteban Murillo and other exponents of Baroque art in Spain is clear in paintings such as Boys Picking Fruit and Boys Climbing a Tree. Murillo made several compositions where he enhanced the role of children playing at picking fruit.\nThe egregious figure of Diego Rodríguez de Silva y Velázquez, from whom Goya would have been able to study some works owned by the Royal House, is the strongest influence of Spanish art in his cartoons, especially in technique. Jovellanos admires this in his friend the painter. The influence of the Sevillian master was reinforced after the period that the Aragonese spent with the Infante Luis. Goya can make use of rapid brushstrokes to give life to the painting, through a magnificent abstract effect.\nIn almost all the cartoons of the third and fourth series Goya applies a technique with strong colors and a large spotlight placed in the center of the painting, as Velázquez did in his younger years. The river of The Tobacco Guards uses a brushstroke identical to the one used by the Sevillian, while the still lifes and tiles of The Pottery Vendor underlie a tribute to the painter and his Christ in the House of Martha and Mary.\nOn the other hand, the portrait that appears in the background of The Fair of Madrid evokes an unquestionable Velázquez style, and the distribution of figures, as well as the brownish tones of A Stickball Game, once again remind us of the master from Seville.\nThe only influence of foreign art, besides French and British, that can be found in these Goyaesque works is that of Rembrandt. The Dutchman, as Goya said, was \"his master\", along with Velázquez and nature. The vivid tonalities and the stain effect that The Swing produces in the viewer are an implicit reference to Rembrandt's art.\n\n\n==== References in later works by Goya ====\n\nShortly after completing the fifth series, Goya made seven ornamental paintings for the country estate of the Dukes of Osuna. The scenes are predominantly rural and quiet, gentle subjects prevail in these paintings. The harmonious and pleasing colors do not prevent Goya from believing that scenes of country leisure should be left for the bucolic residences. There was no amusement in any of Goya's paintings, and even in some of them there is an atmosphere of violence (Stagecoach Hijacking). The similarity with the cartoons lies in the fact that the paintings of the Osuna villa reflect the same country atmosphere as the tapestries, especially the one located on the banks of the Manzanares.\nGlendinning recognizes that The Snowstorm and The Injured Mason, undertaken at that time, are Goya's main source of inspiration for these paintings. The presence of \"dangers\" that denote both are a faithful sign that the Aragonese no longer believed in picturesqueness and longed to separate himself from the customs imposed on the tapestries.\nLos caprichos is a series of engravings designed by Goya in the nineties. Its first stage is framed within the aesthetic climate favored by the cartoons. Maja and Cloaked Men, from the second series, is a direct precedent of some of the most characteristic scenes of the etchings of Los caprichos, where the game of love and jealousy becomes the argumentative center of the composition.\n\nIn the paintings of the last series, a tense and deceitful relationship between the two sexes prevailed —one of Goya's favorite themes, which he developed in Los caprichos—, and Tomlinson (2008) notes that preparatory drawings for such a series may have been developed since then. Such is the case of The Straw Manikin and The Wedding, which, as mentioned above, are covert satires of the world of relationships.\nChicken Fights is a sarcastic allegory of the removals and appointments of ministers in the time of Charles IV, although disguised as a harmless children's game. To Rise and To Fall, capricho number 56, published in 1799, repeats the scene but now ironizing the secretaries of state in the form of grotesque dolls.\nGoya's sharp irony reached its peak with the so-called Black Paintings (1819-1823). The work of this group that is most closely linked to the tapestry cartoons is A Pilgrimage to San Isidro, although the same subject is treated in Pilgrimage to the Fountain of San Isidro. The same theme had been touched upon by Goya more than three decades earlier (sixth series of cartoons: The Meadow of San Isidro and The Chapel de San Isidro), but now, instead of a display of wholesome fun, drunkenness and unhinged faces are present. The same theme, which Goya used to love, was used for his 1812 work The Burial of the Sardine.\n\n\n=== By series ===\nThe seven series scheme proposed by Tomlinson in her studies is reproduced here. As mentioned above, there is no uniform criterion for determining the exact number of series.\n\n\n==== First series (1775) ====\n\nWhen he arrived at the Royal Factory, Goya had only painted religious, historical or mythological paintings. It was Bayeu to whom Goya owed his training as a carton painter. In fact, the delivery receipt for Goya's first five cartoons was made out in Bayeu's name. The same document stipulates that these cartoons were executed under his direction by Goya. All the receipts for the following series appear in the name of the painter from Fuendetodos.\nThis first series was long ignored by Goya scholars, as it was usually attributed to Ramón or Francisco Bayeu. In the shadow of his brother-in-law, the painter began a difficult period at court and his name was even confused: \"Ramón Goya\", as he was called in a document of the period.\nThe first series of tapestry cartoons consists of nine paintings on hunting themes, Prince Charles' main interest. The dining room of the heirs to the throne at El Escorial —the palace where hunting exercises were most practised— was to be decorated with them. Unlike in other series, the exact place of each painting in the dining room is not known. In this series Goya depicts more realistic, everyday scenes.\nIt was painted in collaboration with his brother-in-law Ramón Bayeu and under the watchful eye of his wife's other brother, Francisco. The mark of the elder Bayeu is perceptible both in the preparatory drawings and in the resulting cartoons, as he indicated to the young Goya the subjects to be treated. On 24 May 1775 Bayeu delivered five of Goya's cartoons to Cornelio Vandergroten: The Boar Hunt (the largest painting in the series), Hunting Party, The Angler (the only painting in the series related to fishing, although some hunting activities can be identified in the background), Boys Hunting with Owl and a still life identified as Hunting Still Life. Other paintings in the series, delivered on 30 October, were the over-doors of Hunting Dogs and Hunting with a Decoy, as well as two corner paintings with the themes of Hunter with his Dogs and Hunter Loading his Shotgun.\n\nThis series is characterised by outlined contours, loose pastel brushstrokes, rounded-faced and static characters. The drawings, mostly done in charcoal, also bear witness to the very clear influence of Bayeu. The layout is different from other cartoons by Goya, where the figures are more free and dispersed throughout the space. It is more oriented to the needs of the weavers than to the painter's artistic creativity. It resorts to the pyramidal composition, as in Hunting with a Decoy and Hunting Party.\nIt may have been well received in the factory and at court, as the directors —especially Mengs— encouraged Goya to make \"cartoons of his own invention\". He did not return to the subject of hunting until ten years later, with the painting Hunter by a Spring.\nThe traditionalism of the subjects in this series, together with the impersonal style, makes it difficult to attribute the cartoons correctly without documents. Until the 19th century, the works in this set were usually taken to be the work of Francisco Bayeu.\nThe most accomplished and important composition in the series, Hunting Party, has some obvious flaws in colour and tonality, but it proves Goya's ability to paint a good hunting scene.\n\n\n==== Second series (1776-1778) ====\n\nFor this series Goya had already freed himself from the powerful influence of Bayeu and for the first time conceived cartoons for his own. For the Dining Room of the Prince and Princess of Asturias in El Pardo, he drew on the courtly taste of the time, which wanted to get closer to its people. The aristocrats wanted to be like the majos, to look like them and even went so far as to dress up in majos' clothes to take part in their parties. This is why Goya includes mentions of this group in almost all the cartoons in this series.\nThe second series of cartoons consists of Picnic on the Banks of the Manzanares, Dance of San Antonio de la Florida, An Avenue in Andalusia, The Parasol, The Kite, The Drinker, Quarrel in the New Tavern, Boys Picking Fruit and Children Blowing up a Bladder. According to José Rogelio Buendía's study, most of the cartoons in the series were delivered on 12 August 1777.\nThe fact that Goya was able to paint his cartoons without the tutelage of Francisco Bayeu has been appreciated, although the first paintings in the series show some flaws, as in the case of The Picnic, a cartoon with imaginative and varied colours that nevertheless shows great disorder in the composition. A study of the work suggests that Goya did not pay much attention to the details in order to avoid problems for the weavers, or else he chose to ignore them because he was unaware of what they meant.\nA letter from Goya, dated 30 October 1776, reveals that the painter had obtained autonomy as a tapestry painter. In this document he encloses the description of The Picnic, and mentions that he had been helped by Mengs.\n\nIt can be said that the second series is closely related to the third and fourth, as all three capture the atmosphere in Madrid at the time. All three sets deal with popular and spontaneous themes, which are not without freshness either. But Goya was unable to develop his artistic genius freely. Although he got rid of Bayeu, the factory maintained strict guidelines regarding the themes for the production of cartoons.\nThe painter completely distanced himself from the hunting diversions imposed on him by his brother-in-law. The paintings in the second series express a compromise in terms of the weaver's needs, as simple compositions, light colours and good lighting would allow for better weaving. The series deals with majos, petimetras and gypsies, and distinguishes more complex subjects undertaken with clear outlines and explicitly rigid figures. The Aragonese artist identifies several of the majos in his cartoons in the series as inhabitants of the various Spanish provinces. For example, in Quarrel in the New Tavern, Goya describes one of the men involved in the brawl as \"a Murcian\".\nBozal and other authors specialising in Goya's painting consider The Parasol to be the most successful work in this series, as it combines the pyramidal art of Neoclassicism with the chromatic effects of the emerging \"gallant\" painting.\n\n\n==== Third series (1778-1779) ====\nIn October 1777 Goya completed his second series. It was such a success that he was commissioned to undertake a third series for the antedormitory of the Prince and Princess of Asturias in El Pardo. He returned to popular themes, but now focused on the themes of the Madrid fair. The audiences between the painter and the princes Charles and Maria Luisa in 1779 were fruitful in the sense that they enabled Goya to continue his career at court. Now that they had become kings, the other princes became prominent promoters of the Aragonese painter.\nOn 4 January 1779 Goya gave the factory The Fair of Madrid, The Haw Seller, The Pottery Vendor and The Military Man and the Lady. Tomlinson assumes that this record is incomplete, as the overdoors are omitted as they are considered less important. Other paintings in the series, sent to the factory shortly afterwards, are Children in a Chariot, The Blind Guitarist, Boys Playing Soldiers and Majo with Guitar.\nOnce again Goya achieved overwhelming success. Proof of this is the fact that he applied for the post of painter of the chamber on the death of Mengs, but was refused. However, he had already managed to win the sympathy of the princes.\nHis palette adopts varied, earthy contrasts, the subtlety of which enables him to highlight the most important figures in the painting. Goya's technique is reminiscent of Velázquez, whose portraits Goya was reproducing in his early etchings.\nDetailed descriptions of this series have made it possible to reconstruct how the tapestries were laid out in El Pardo. Goya relates in his correspondence that the series was intended to be hung clockwise in the antedormitory. If this had been the case, The Blind Guitarist would have been on the north wall, but when it was rejected by the tapestry makers, its place was taken by A Stickball Game. The east and west walls would be decorated with The Pottery Vendor and The Fair of Madrid, the largest panels in the series, and also with the overdoors Children in a Chariot and Boys Playing Soldiers. Finally, the south wall would be decorated with The Haw Seller and Military Man and the Lady.\nGoya's artistic growth is already evident. In this group of paintings, devoted entirely to the country and populist tastes of the princes, he had the opportunity to demonstrate that he no longer needed any supervision. On the other hand, two of his most successful works, The Pottery Vendor and The Fair of Madrid, not only from this series but from the cartoons in general, are overflowing with naturalness. The figures appear more human and natural, and not attached to the rigid Baroque or to a budding Neoclassicism, but to a more eclectic painting.\n\nThe landscape, which Goya used to draw with great care and attention to every aspect, becomes a problem in the weaving. The tapestry weavers cannot fully develop the minutiae that Goya designed. Above all, it is difficult to trace the outlines with the utmost clarity. The conflict led to the return of The Blind Guitarist, and Goya found the solution by painting A Stickball Game, which was to be hung in the bedroom and thus form part of the fourth series.\nThe themes of the third series are varied. Flirtation can be found in The Haw Seller and Military Man and the Lady; childish candour in Children Playing Soldiers and Children in a Chariot; popular scenes of the capital in The Fair of Madrid, The Blind Guitarist, Majo with Guitar and The Pottery Vendor. The last two works in the series are difficult to classify, such as The Swing and A Stickball Game. The hidden meaning is also present in several paintings, as The Fair of Madrid is a disguised criticism of the high society of the time.\nThe critics have seen in The Pottery Vendor the most beautiful cardboard in this series, as the use of nuances and the fine treatment of the objects is remarkable. The harmony of the coppery golds, the greys and the blue of the sky is outstanding. The gathering of characters from all social classes constitutes a breakthrough in genre painting. It shows a genuine dynamism hitherto unseen in Spanish painting.\n\n\n==== Fourth series (1779-1780) ====\n\nMany authors, such as Mena, Bozal and Glendinning, consider the fourth series to be a continuation of the third, as it took place in the same palace at El Pardo. Tomlinson, however, points out that this set has different stylistic features from the previous one. It was intended for the bedroom of the Princes of Asturias in the aforementioned Palace of El Pardo.\nValentín de Sambricio and Gregorio Cruzada Villaamil were the first scholars to study tapestry cartoons. Both point out that the bedroom walls were not entirely adorned with Goya's tapestry cartoons, but that the princes used French furniture to complete the decoration. It could be conjectured that Goya's work may have been affected by this situation.\nA document signed by Goya states that the series was undertaken between 1779 and 1780. The cartoons produced during this period are The Swing, A Stickball Game, The Rendezvous, The Tobacco Guards, The Washerwomen —the largest composition in the series, which was to establish the subjects to be treated in the rest—, The Young Bull, The Woodcutters, and the overpaintings Boy with a Bird and Boy and a Tree.\nUnlike the third series, its successor was not so much influenced by the life of the majos as by scenes of a more rural nature derived from the second series.\nDetailed descriptions by Goya have survived from this series, which are the main source for studying it. Despite this, it contains strong details that are only visible through careful observation. Once again, the sexual sense is developed in the characters of the series: in The Washerwomen, a woman caresses the animal's horns, a very clear phallic connotation. It should be recalled that the poor reputation of these workers had been a recurring theme in 18th-century literature and that in 1790 a royal decree prevented the washerwomen of the Manzanares from addressing middle-class citizens.\n\nThe animal's horns again have an allusive meaning to the phallus in The Novillada, where a bullfighter has fun with a steer. The pelvis of the man in the foreground is framed by the animal. The phallic sense obtained from this situation is combined with that of The Washerwomen. Many critics have seen The Young Bull as a self-portrait of Goya, who was also a great bullfighting enthusiast.\nThe female counterparts to these paintings are The Washerwomen and The Swing. The immense game of flirtation drawn by Goya is completed by the largest piece in the series and the one that contains the most sexual mysteries, A Stickball Game. This painting contains a strong sexual message that can only be deciphered by comparing it with others in the same room. It is unheard of that such a puritanical monarch as Charles III —who tried to destroy the Hapsburg nude collection— could have allowed such a strong sexual message to remain in his palace, but most authors believe that this was because few realised the true meaning of the painting.\nIn The Tobacco Guard an allegory of virility can be discerned, as, like The Young Bull, it was placed in front of paintings with feminine themes. In this specific case, the guard dressed with pistols, swords and other weapons is a metaphor for manhood, which, in this situation, lies in the sword held between his legs.\nThe last two cartoons in the series were used as overdoors, The Fountain and The Dog, now in Patrimonio Nacional. The cartoons were lost in the 19th century and the only way to study them has been through Goya's descriptions. Tomlinson has argued that the tapestry makers deviated from Goya's original composition, so the resulting tapestries would not be a reliable vehicle for studying Goya's works.\nThe placement of the cartoons and the sense they made when viewed as a whole may have been a strategy devised by Goya so that his clients, Carlos and María Luisa, would be caught up in the wall-to-wall flirtation. The colours of his paintings repeat the chromatic range of the previous series, but now evolve into a greater use of the backgrounds and the faces of his characters.\nAround this time, Goya began to stand out among court painters, who followed his example by depicting the customs of the people in their cartoons, but they were not as well received as those of the Aragonese painter.\nIn 1780 the supply of tapestries came to an abrupt halt. The war that the crown had waged with England to recover Gibraltar had caused serious damage to the kingdom's economy and unnecessary expenses had to be eliminated. Charles III temporarily suppressed the Royal Tapestry Factory, and Goya had to work in the private sector.\n\n\n==== Fifth series (1786-1787) ====\n\nIn 1786, after work resumed at the Royal Factory, the Aragonese painter returned to painting cartoons. He was commissioned to paint a series for the dining room of the Princes of Asturias in El Pardo, described as \"paintings of jocular and pleasant subjects needed for that site\". Despite being identified as \"the dining room\", recent studies have established that it is the heir's living room, where he also ate.\nFor this series Goya tackled a theme with a long tradition in Western art: that of the four seasons. But this time the Aragonese painter put his own stamp on the paintings, turning the allegories into bucolic scenes representative of each period of the year. The theme of the periods of the year used to be the favourite theme of rococo and tapestry to decorate dining rooms.\nBut Charles III died unexpectedly on 14 December 1788, and the decorative programme that had been drawn up for El Pardo was left incomplete. The cartoons from this series, now transferred to tapestry, were sent to El Escorial, where they were used to decorate the walls of the monastery without a specific order.\n\nThe cartoons in this series were Goya's first work at court after being appointed painter to the king in June 1786. On 12 September he sent a letter to Zapater in which he stated: \"I am now very busy making sketches for a piece where the Prince is eating\". Shortly afterwards he had to show them to the monarch, as at the end of the year he submitted an account of the expenses of \"a coach to the Royal Site of El Escorial to present to His Majesty (may God preserve him) the Drafts for the Piece where the Prince eats in El Pardo\".\nThe first part of the series deals with village life in a more traditional manner. Two of the paintings depict country activities (The Snowstorm and Summer) and two represent aristocratic customs rooted in the countryside (The Flower Girls and The Grape Harvest).\nThe Flower Girls demonstrates an unparalleled beauty. Summer rejects the traditional model of Ceres as an allegory of summer, and instead depicts a group of peasants resting and playing pranks on their companions. In The Grape Harvest, autumn is depicted as a traditional sale of fruit and other country delicacies, with a touch of elegance provided by the finely dressed woman on the left and the little boy trying to pick the fruit. Here again, Goya provides another magnificent depiction of childhood. Finally, The Snowstorm is the most studied cartoon in the series and Goya's first work with a markedly realistic character, as evidenced by the peasants suffering the harshness of winter.\nThe same dose of verism that Goya applied to The Snowstorm is repeated in The Injured Mason. Originally designed as a satirical painting —his sketch was The Drunk Mason—, Goya unexpectedly changed the direction of the work, and now paints a wounded mason being held up by his companions. The pain of the working classes depicted in The Wounded Bricklayer is matched by the misery radiated in Poor People at the Fountain.\nIt is these three paintings that depict pain in its best-known facets. In fact, it is thought that the woman and children in Poor People at the Fountain are the family of the injured worker in The Injured Mason, as they were close to each other in the dining room. In the same vein is The Snowstorm or The Winter, but here he portrays the harshness of winter attacking defenceless peasants.\nOther paintings in the series are Boys with Mastiffs, a possible allegory of Gemini, according to Tomlinson; Boy on a Ram, a companion piece to the previous one; Cat Fight, a window shutter for the dining room, whose authorship is doubtful; Magpie in a Tree, a large painting reminiscent of Boy with a Bird and Boy and a Tree. Finally, the last two works in the series are Shepherd Playing a Pipe and its companion piece Hunter by a Spring, echoes of the series of country and hunting scenes.\n\n\n==== Sixth series (1787-1788) ====\n\nOnce the decorative project for the Prince's dining room at El Pardo had been completed, the success achieved by Goya's work allowed the Aragonese to continue to participate in the next series, which would decorate the apartments of the daughters of the Princes of Asturias, the Infantas.\nBut King Charles III fell ill at the end of 1788 and died on 14 December of the same year. The work plan for El Pardo was left unfinished, and only the cartoon known as Blind Man's Bluff was made into a tapestry, the others remaining only as cartoons.\nTomlinson (2008) considers that if this series had been completed it would have been known as the most complex and well-done of Goya's previous works. However, despite the fact that it was never transferred to tapestry, it has been possible to study it in detail.\nThe first known record of this series dates from 31 May 1788. A few months earlier Goya had received the commission, and on that date he wrote to Zapater to announce that he had finished designing the cartoons and would soon begin work on them. Goya wrote that \"the subjects are difficult and very laborious, such as that of The Meadow of San Isidro, on the day of the saint himself, with all the bustle that this court is accustomed to have\".\nAs Goya stated in his letter to Zapater, the central scene of the series would have been The Meadow of San Isidro, which only remained as a small sketch measuring 44 x 94 cm. The painter states that he worked practically from life. This sketch is a magnificent preconception of what would become 19th century Impressionist painting. In the field of topography, Goya had masterfully depicted the architecture of Madrid, which appears here once again. The painter captures the two largest buildings of the time, the Royal Palace and the church of San Francisco el Grande. The village is depicted at the time of the joyful picnic on 15 May, the day of San Isidro Labrador, patron saint of the town of Madrid. Although the subject could lend itself to hidden erotic allegories, the Aragonese artist rejects them —unlike other paintings in the third and fourth series— and shows only a festive scene in a free, unconventional composition.\n\nOne of the best known paintings in the series is Blind Man's Bluff, which did become a tapestry and was one of the most studied cartoons. It recreates the popular game of the same name, typical of the aristocracy and suitable for the daughters of princes. Some of the participants are dressed as majos and others in Parisian fashion. The mobility and dynamism of the painting makes the viewer believe that he can open the circle of participants. The fine handling of the light suggests an aristocratic bearing and the contrasts lead to a warm, familiar scene. One of the major differences between the sketch and the final tapestry is that in the first one a woman appeared outside the circle, possibly the partner of the man holding the ladle. For unknown reasons, Goya decided to remove this figure from the resulting cartoon.\nThe Hermitage of Saint Isidore on the Saint's Feast Day again discusses the theme of the popular festival in Madrid, as did The Meadow of San Isidro. The two paintings are closely linked. In The Hermitage of Saint Isidore there is a marked dynamism and an almost perfect outline of the majestic chapel. Other paintings in the series are Country Picnic, in which Goya changes the stereotype of the picnic and transforms it into a painting in the neoclassical style; and Harassed Cat, an almost unknown sketch that has been forgotten by critics, despite its attractive backlighting and rapid brushstrokes.\n\n\n==== Seventh series (1791-1792) ====\n\nGoya received the title of chamber painter after painting portraits of the new monarchs, Charles IV and Maria Luisa of Parma, heirs to the late Charles III. Now, aware of his new responsibilities, he rejected proposals to paint new series of cartoons.\nEl Escorial is now the favourite place of the kings, who have abandoned El Pardo. At that time, the making of tapestries for the second enclosure was suspended, although it was made clear that for other projects the Factory could allow \"drawings to be made that would please, and in which good taste would shine through\". And on 20 April 1790 the court painters received a communiqué stating that \"the King has agreed to determine the rural and jocular scenes, which he wants to be represented in the tapestries\".\nGoya was on the list of artists who were to paint cartoons to decorate El Escorial. However, the king's painter, who is now the king's court painter, initially refused to undertake another —in his opinion— tiresome series, as he considered it too much of a craft and believed he had split from the guild of cartonists. But the success of the first of the cartoons in what was to be his seventh series, Gossiping Women, a masterly account of a conversation between majas, encouraged Goya to continue.\nHe was assigned the cartoons to be hung in the royal office of the Monastery, and the king even threatened to suspend Goya's salary if he refused to collaborate. But shortly afterwards he travelled to Andalusia, where he became seriously ill and even died, leaving the series incomplete according to plan: only seven of the twelve cartoons planned were completed.\nIn addition to Gossiping Women, the paintings in the series include Chicken Fights, a playful children's game alluding to the change of ministers; The Stilts, an allegory of the harshness of life; The Wedding, a scathing criticism of arranged marriages; and Young Women with Pitchers, a painting that has been interpreted in various ways, as an allegory of the four ages of man or of the majas and celestinas, but no consensus has been reached; Boys Climbing a Tree, a foreshortened composition that cannot avoid comparison with Boys Picking Fruit, from the second series; and The Straw Manikin, Goya's last tapestry cartoon, which symbolises the implicit domination of women over men, with evident carnivalesque overtones of an atrocious game in which women rejoice in manipulating a man.\n\nThis series is often considered to be the most ironic and critical of the society of the time. Goya may have been influenced by political themes —the French Revolution was at its height—. In Chicken Fights, for example, the children going up and down are a disguised sarcasm on the volatile situation of the government, reflected in the periodic change of ministers.\nAll the paintings are quite different in size, and Young Women with Pitchers is one of the longest pieces. They are also very different in the way they capture reality, but satire is the common denominator of the whole series. As in all the previous series, with the possible exception of the third —set in Madrid— the rural and country atmosphere prevails over the urban.\nThe fact that this is a cheerful facet of Spanish society does not exempt the paintings from fierce criticism of the government, although Goya's position means that he has to disguise it in order to prevent his emoluments from diminishing. The open-air games played by young men, boys and women are a perfect setting for Goya's covert criticisms.\nThe Wedding is the best known and most accomplished painting in this series. Once again, the radiant childhood, so common in Goya's work, appears in the figure of the boy on the left. The village priest and the old man who opens his arms, possibly the bride's father, stand out. The woman's beauty belies the ugliness of her future husband, although he may be \"a good match\". Goya's fearlessness in capturing the facial and characterological expressions of the figures in his paintings is confirmed here. In short, it is a joyful procession of people marching with a strong sense of irony.\n\n\n== Fate ==\n\nWhen the tapestry was finished, it was placed in its assigned place in the room previously agreed upon. Tomlinson notes that the series made between 1787 and 1792 (fifth, sixth and seventh) were never hung as detailed in the factory plan.\nThe vast majority of the cartoons were stored in one of the basements of the Royal Factory. During the War of Independence, the antique dealer Livinio Stuyck made an inventory of one hundred large cartons, twenty-seven small ones and sixty-six cartons for shutters or over doors. The general archive records that the main authors were Goya, Bayeu and Antonio González Velázquez.\nIn 1858 a large number of Goya's cartoons were moved to the basement of the Royal Palace in Madrid, where they remained until 1870, when Gregorio Cruzada discovered them and took them to the Museo del Prado. They first appeared in the Prado's catalogue in 1876.\nOn 19 January of that year the following cartoons were reported stolen: Dogs on a Leash, Majo with Guitar, Chicken Fights, Children in a Chariot, The Doctor and The Sew-Saw. The last three pieces are among the very few cartoons that are not in the Prado Museum.\nThis prompted Cruzada to publicise the cartoons, which were soon well received in Spanish art circles. The Museo del Prado, the institution that inherited the royal collections, has received almost forty of the cartoons. For their part, most of the final tapestries are still in their original locations, such as El Pardo and El Escorial.\nThe vast majority of Goya's preparatory sketches for his cartoons, such as those for the sixth series and The Threshing Floor —a sketch of The Summer—, were sold to the Duke and Duchess of Osuna, the artist's patron, in 1799. In 1896, his heirs auctioned the works. The family of the Spanish nobleman Pedro Fernández Durán y Bernaldo de Quiraldós acquired some of them, such as The Drunk Mason. At this auction the Prado acquired The Meadow of San Isidro, Blind Man's Bluff and The Hermitage of San Isidro, all preparatory canvases for the Aragonese artist's cartoons. On Fernández Durán's death in 1931, his will stated that his entire collection of paintings would be transferred to the Museo del Prado. On the other hand, some collectors, such as José Lázaro Galdiano and several American businessmen, bought cartons such as Boy on a Ram and Picnic in the Country Picnic.\nBetween 1984 and 1987, six cartoons by Goya, including The Cats and Hunter by a Spring, were discovered in the cellars of the Prado Museum. They are believed to have been housed there by Sambricio more than a hundred years ago.\nAs for the study of the work, the first historiographer to do so was Cruzada himself. In 1946, Valentín de Sambricio's study was published, which provided numerous documents for an in-depth knowledge of the situation of the paintings. It was in 1971 that Jutta Held's book appeared, which was innovative in that it analysed the paintings in depth through documents obtained from the archives of the Royal Factory. Together with Sambricio's work and the catalogue by Pierre Gassier and Juliet Wilson Bareau —which is not only limited to the cartoons but to Goya's entire oeuvre— it is the most complete catalogue of the tapestry cartoons.\nA few years later, the first purely analytical studies began to appear. In the early 1980s, Nigel Glendinning and Fred Licht published their books Goya and His Critics (in Spanish: Goya y sus críticos) and Goya in Perspective, respectively. In 1989 the University of Cambridge published Janis Tomlinson's book on Goya's early years at court, translated into Spanish in 1993 as Francisco de Goya: los cartones para tapices y los comienzos de su carrera en la Corte de Madrid. Finally, in 2005, studies by Valeriano Bozal and Glendinning himself were published, covering the whole of Goya's life and work, but both devote an important chapter to the study of the cartoons.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Francisco Goya's tapestry cartoons\nList of works by Francisco Goya\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBOZAL, Valeriano (2005).

        "content": "Txikispora is a genus of parasitic protists made up solely of the species Txikispora philomaios. It is the only genus in the family Txikisporidae, which is a member of the class Filasterea and is closely related to Ministeriidae. The lineage was first described in 2022 based on specimens identified from the United Kingdom. The species represents a previously undiscovered type of life that diverged extremely early from animals and fungi. It parasitizes amphipods in the genera Echinogammarus and Orchestia and most frequently infects their hemolymph and hemocytes.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe Filozoan species was described in 2022 in the Journal of Eukaryotic Microbiology by Ander Urrutia, Stephen Feist, and David Bass. The new generic and specific combination Txikispora philomaios means \"May-loving spore\", in reference to its presence in collections during only a few days during the month of May. Txikispora is derived from two Basque words: txiki meaning \"small\" and spora meaning \"spore\". The specific epithet philomaios is also Basque: philo meaning \"love\" and maios meaning \"May\".\nA Rel homology region (RHR) was identified in Txikispora philomaios. The characteristics of the RHR of Txikispora philomaios was most similar to Tunicaraptor unikontum, suggesting a phylogenetic relationship between the two species.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe species goes through several stages of life. The first is as a single spherical cell, called the monokaryotic stage. It usually has a cell wall, and is characterized by a nucleus with a small nucleolus on its periphery and many small mitochondria with diverse lipoid structures. The next stage is multinucleated, and consists of four cells joined together and is somewhat larger. It appears to have three cells, with the fourth often hidden from view. The unicellular stage is often split off from the multicellular one.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nTxikispora philomaios parasitizes the amphipod genera Echinogammarus and Orchestia, but is not found in the related genera Gammarus and Melita. Individuals infected by the parasite displayed yellowing tegument, a less rigid carapace, less visible internal organs, and increased lethargy and unresponsiveness. Txikispora philomaios specifically infects the hemolymph and individual hemocytes, with up to ten parasites found in a single hemocyte. Other organs that are infected are the hepatopancreas, testes, and ovaries. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nLeger, Michelle; Ros-Rocher, Nuria; Najle, Sebastian (2022). \"Rel/NF-kB Transcription Factors Emerged at the Onset of Opisthokonts\".

She is the UN Women Representative in Malawi, the African Union Commission, and the UN Economic Commission for Africa, a position she assumed in May 2013. She formerly served as UN Women Representative in Ethiopia. She was the UNIFEM and UN Women Chief of Africa for 12 years, based in New York City, United States. Chiwara effectively led UN Women's strategic collaborations with a number of organizations, including the European Commission, the World Bank, the OECD DAG Gender Net, FEMNET, the YWCA, the African Union Commission, the UNECA, and the African Development Bank.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nLetty Chiwara grew up in an agricultural community in Zimbabwe with eight siblings, where girls typically received less educational opportunity and preferential treatment. However, her parents defied these norms and sent her to attend a boarding school.\n\n\n== Career ==\nChiwara worked in her home country of Zimbabwe as a Town Planning Officer in Matabeleland South in Harare for four years. While working in this role, she received a scholarship to pursue a Master's degree in Urban Development Planning at the University of London. A gender course during her studies inspired her to address these disparities.\nUpon returning home to fulfill her scholarship's service requirement, Chiwara resigned from her government job. After eight months, she was hired as a consultant with UNIFEM in Harare. This initial project involved bringing women from the Southern African Development Community to a trade fair. She now has a leadership position with UN Women in Ethiopia, where she collaborates with the African Union Commission and the UN Economic Commission for Africa. She led the Africa Unite Campaign against violence against women and girls and is currently leading efforts to develop an initiative focused on ending harmful practices and child marriage in Africa.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Nexchip (Chinese: 晶合集成; pinyin: Jīnghé Jíchéng) is a partially state-owned publicly listed Chinese pure-play semiconductor foundry company based in Hefei, Anhui.\nIn terms of revenue, it is currently mainland China's third largest semiconductor foundry behind SMIC and Hua Hong Semiconductor. It is also one of the largest semiconductor foundries in the world based on the same metric.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn May 2015, Nexchip was originally established as a joint venture between Taiwanese company Powerchip and the Hefei City Construction and Investment Holding Group, a state-owned enterprise. Its founder, Michael Tsai had previously served as President of Powerchip and had also held senior position at other Taiwanese technology companies. According to Tsai, Nexchip was founded on the advantages of the local industrial supply chain, driven by BOE Technology to become the world's leading Display Driver ICs (DDI) chip foundry.In response to the United States New Export Controls on Advanced Computing and Semiconductors to China, anonymous sources have reported that Nexchip was purchasing everything it could including second-hand tools to keep its fabs running.On 5 May 2023, Nexchip held its initial public offering becoming a listed company on the  Shanghai Stock Exchange STAR Market. The offering was 1,160x oversubscribed due to popular demand and raised 9.96 billion yuan making it one of the largest IPOs in 2023.In October 2023, Nexchips opened a new fab in Hefei that specialized in manufacturing car chips. As China's leading DDI foundry, it wanted to expand into to the automotive power chip market. According to Nexchip, overconcentration on the DDI sector was a potential risk due to order fluctuation and bargaining power. Therefore, it wanted to diversify into other areas. Its five largest customers accounted for 66.47% of sales.As of 2023, Nexchip has achieved mass production for 12-inch wafer foundry platforms of the 90nm to 150 nm process nodes. It is now in the risk-taking phase of mass production of 55 nm nodes  Apart from the DDI sector, Nexchip is also involved in microcontrollers, CMOS Image sensors and Power Management ICs. Nexchip's 2023 half-year report showed DDI accounted for 87.84% of sales and its process nodes with the most sales were the 90 nm platform followed by the 110 nm platform.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSemiconductor industry in China\nList of semiconductor fabrication plants\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "The Chikugo Provincial Capital Site (筑後国府跡, Chikugo Kokufu ato) is an archaeological site consisting of the ruins of the Nara period to early Heian period Provincial Capital of Chikugo Province, located across the Aikawa, Asatsuma, and Mii neighborhoods of the city of Kurume, Fukuoka,  Japan. The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1996, with the area under protection expanded in 2007.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nFollowing the Taika Reform (645 AD)  which aimed at a centralization of the administration following the Chinese model (ritsuryō), provincial capitals were established in the various provinces, headed by an official titled kokushi, who replaced the older Kuni no miyatsuko. With a square layout, the provincial capitals were patterned after  the Capital of Japan, first Fujiwara-kyō and then Heijō-kyō, which in turn were modelled on the Tang capital Chang'an, but on a much, much smaller scale. Each had office buildings for administration, finance, police and military and the official building of the governor, as well as granaries for tax rice and other taxable produce. In the periphery there was the provincial temple (kokubun-ji), and nunnery (kokubun-niji) and the garrison. This system collapsed with the growth of feudalism in the Late Heian period, and the location of many of the provincial capitals is now lost.\nThe Chikugo Provincial Capital was located on a low plateau on the left bank of the downstream where the Chikugo River, which flows westward on the south side of the Chikugo Plain, changes its flow significantly to the south. The existence of the kokufu ruins at this location was speculated by scholars of Kurume Domain in the Edo Period. During archaeological excavations in 1961, relics such as the remains of an enclosure containing the foundations of a dug-out pillar buildings, roof tiles, and a circular ink stone were discovered, indicating that a large-scale government office was operated in the area during the Nara period. Further excavations from 1972 confirmed that the complex had been reconstructed at four locations at different times. The first phase was in the late 7th century, and the complex showed a strong military flavor, with deep moats. It is speculated that this phase pre-dates the start of the kokufu system, and may have been related to the capital of Tsukushi Province before its division. The second phase was from the mid-8th century. The complex includes a Buddhist temple and workshops. This complex was destroyed by fire around the time of Fujiwara no Sumitomo's rebellion. The third phase is from the early 10th century, during which time the complex greatly expanded and was even larger than the Dazaifu complex which was the civil authority over all of Kyushu. The fourth and final phase was from the late 11th century. It was on a much smaller scale, and it disappears from the documentary record in the late 12th century.\nPlans are underway to preserve the site as the Chikugo Kokufu Ruins Historical Park.  It is located about a five-minute walk from Daigakumae Station on the JR Kyushu Kyudai Main Line.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\n\n\n== External links ==\nFukuoka Tourism web (in Japanese)\nKurume City home page (in Japanese)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Oleksiy Vasylovych Prylipka (Ukrainian: Олексій Васильович Приліпка; born 9 March 1944) is a Ukrainian agronomist and political scientist who earned the title of Hero of Ukraine in 2002. He was able to write about thirty scientific publications, including seven guides for academic institutions and business professionals, by skillfully combining his work with scientific expertise.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBorn on 9 March 1944, in the Ukrainian village of Bohoduhivka. Prylipka's early years were enmeshed in the labor and suffering typical of post-war rural life following World War II. He learned the values of hard work, love for the country, and the inherent worth of agricultural labor from his parents, who toiled long hours on the communal farm. In 1971, he received his degree as a scientific agronomic from the Ukrainian Agricultural Academy (now National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine), and later as a political scientist from the Kyiv Higher Party School.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1962, Prylipka began working as a turner in a Mariupol factory. Upon graduating in 1971, he was employed by the Kyiv Oblast's Pere-yaslav-Khmelnytskyi Department of Agriculture as the chief agronomic and director of the region's plant protection station. He served for the party in the Kyiv Oblast for sixteen years, and for two of those years, served as the deputy chairman of the Ukrainian State Committee for Village Social Development.\nWhen Prylipka took over as general director of the company Scientific Research Production Agro-Pushcha-Vodytsia in 1994, his journey to prominence as a leader officially started. Entrusted with reviving a failing organization on the edge of bankruptcy, he executed an incredible recovery. By virtue of his leadership and organizational abilities, he elevated the company to the forefront of the national agriculture industry. By using modern technology and contemporary, computerized management techniques, he not only brought operations back to life but also led innovation that resulted in the creation of new vegetable crop kinds.\nWith over thirty scientific publications under Prylipka, including seven university and company specialized guides, he has made a substantial contribution to the debate on agriculture. Furthermore, via his leadership at National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine (NUBiP), he has been instrumental in developing the following generation of agricultural experts. The Department of Closed Soil, the Scientific and Training Center of Horticulture, and the Research and Training Center of Closed Soil grew under his direction.\nPrylipka is the Head of the Department at NUBiP. He is also an academician of the Academy of Technological Sciences of Ukraine and a Doctor of Economic Sciences. In March 2006, he was a Lytvyn's People's Bloc candidate for people's deputies of Ukraine, no. 126 on the list of electoral district.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nPrylipka's family was one of the communal farmers. While Hanna Andriivna, his mother, worked on the farm on a daily basis, his father was an automobile driver.\n\n\n== Awards and recognitions ==\nPrylipka received the title of Hero of Ukraine and the Order of the State by Presidential Decree of 13 November 2002, in recognition of his exceptional personal contributions to the advancement of agricultural and contemporary management practices in Ukraine. He has received other awards and recognitions such as:\n\n Hero of Ukraine Order of the State (13 November 2002)\n Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise Fifth Class (6 March 2009)\n Order of Merit Third Class (26 February 2001)\n Medal \"Veteran of Labour\" (1983)\n Medal \"For Labour Valour\" (1976)\nHonorary Diploma of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine (26 June 1999; 14 October 2004)\nState Prize of Ukraine in Science and Technology (19 December 2005)\nHonored Worker of Agriculture of Ukraine (31 October 1997)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

Donaldson was defeated by Edwin Poots MLA, by 19 votes to 17.\nOn 17 June, after 21 days and amid a party crisis, Poots resigned. The Belfast Telegraph described the events as \"one of the most tumultuous days in the DUP's 50-year history\".\nDonaldson declared his candidacy on 21 June to become Leader of the DUP. He was elected unopposed, made leader-designate on 26 June, and was appointed party leader on 30 June.\n\n\n=== Sexual offences charge ===\nOn 28 March 2024, Donaldson was arrested by the Police Service of Northern Ireland and charged with non-recent rape and multiple other sexual offences. The following day he stood down as leader of the DUP, which, as required by its rules, suspended his membership pending the outcome of the judicial process. Donaldson will appear before Newry Magistrates' Court on 24 April 2024.\n\n\n== References ==",

Hatshausen is located to the northeast of Warsingsfehn and Boekzetelerfehn, and is approximately 13 kilometers to the northeast of Leer. It has a population of 602.\nThe nearby settlements of Ayenwolde, Büschersfehn, and Königshoek are administratively part of the village. The village's parish church, the Mary Magdalene Church, dates from 1783 and was built axially on the border with Ayenwolde.\n\n\n== History ==\nHatshausen is first mentioned in the Münster parish register of the 15th century as Harstahusum.\nAround 1613, the preacher Johannes Fabricius worked as a pastor in the community. He is considered the discoverer of sunspots and wrote a Latin work about them, De macullis in sole observatis, which he had printed in Wittenberg in 1611. A monument was erected to him and his father David Fabricius in Osteel in 1892.\nThe preacher Anton Christian Bolenius worked in the community from 1707 to 1716. He introduced moor burning and thus buckwheat cultivation to East Frisia.\nThe formerly independent municipality has formed the municipality of Moormerland together with ten other villages since the municipal reform that came into force on January 1, 1973.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "VILLARI (formerly known as Porcellane VILLARI) is a former Italian porcelain craft workshop founded in 1967 by Cesare and Silvia Villari in Solagna, Italy.\n\n\n== History ==\nVillari was established in 1967 by two founders, Cesare Villari and Silvia Villari as a porcelain craft workshop in Solagna, Italy. Initially, it has been focused on the production of fine porcelain figurines inspired by Capodimonte. In the 1970s, the company expanded its product line to include cups, vases, and chandeliers adorned with handcrafted porcelain flowers.\n In 2000, a collection dedicated to reproductions of neoclassical objects, many of which are in the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, was developed. This led to the Grande Impero Collection, which draws on the forms of the Empire Style that spread in France in the second phase of the neoclassical period (between the 18th and 19th centuries).\nThe brand is distributed worldwide through single-brand boutiques in major world capitals such as Dubai (Dubai Mall), London (Harrods), Istanbul, Beijing and more.\nVILLARI’s products include lighting, fine porcelain, home decor, table top, bathroom accessories, home fragrance, scented candles, corporate gifts, architect & designer's, resource, and jewelry.\n\n\n== Collaboration with artists ==\nIn 1988, VILLARI created two works commissioned by the American pop art artist Jeff Koons: \"St. John the Baptist,\" a free interpretation of Leonardo Da Vinci's \"St. John the Baptist,\" produced in four copies. The other life-size statue was \"Michael Jackson and Bubbles,\" which depicts the singer with his small chimpanzee, painted entirely in 24-carat gold leaf.\nOn May 15, 2001, one of the five copies of \"Michael Jackson and Bubbles\" was auctioned and sold to an anonymous collector for $5,615,000 by Sotheby’s - New York. These works have been exhibited in various museums worldwide, including the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Munich, Cologne, Berlin, Guggenheim, and the MOMA in San Francisco.\nMore recent VILLARI’s collaborations with artists and designers include, Fabio Novembre, Ferruccio Laviani, Li-Jen Shih, Giulio Gianturco, CQ Studio, Elena Xausa, Ramz (About Abdul Al-Romaizan).\n\n\n== References ==",

De Leon has won seven FAMAS Awards, two Gawad Urian, four Luna Awards, eight Star Awards for Movies and eight Metro Manila Film Festival Awards. In 1991, he became the second actor to win \"Best Actor\" in all major award-giving bodies in the Philippines, achieving Grand Slam for his performances in Biktima (1990) and My Other Woman (1990). He received numerous honorary accolades including the FAMAS Circle of Excellence Award in 2005, a star on the Eastwood City Walk of Fame in 2006, the Lino Brocka Lifetime Achievement Award in 2008 and the Legend Award from the Cinema One Originals Digital Film Festival in 2009. In 2007, Philippine Daily Inquirer named De Leon among the best Filipino actors of all time.\nAt age 19, De Leon won his first acting award for his debut film, Tinimbang ka Ngunit Kulang, where he won Best Actor at the 22nd FAMAS Awards, becoming the youngest actor to win in that category. He has since tallied a total of 18 nominations for Best Actor at the FAMAS Awards, taking home four more wins in the succeeding years for his work in Ganito Kami Noon... Paano Kayo Ngayon? (1976), Kapag Napagod ang Puso (1988), My Other Woman (1990) and Ipagpatawad Mo (1991).

He is the most awarded Filipino actor in the Best Actor category at the MMFF history.\nIn 1993, De Leon became the third actor to be inducted into the FAMAS Hall of Fame, joining Fernando Poe Jr., Eddie Garcia and Joseph Estrada as the only inductees in the Best Actor category. In 2019, he was inducted into the MMFF Hall of Fame, joining Anthony Alonzo and Cesar Montano as the only male inductees at the film festival. With his thirteenth Best Actor nomination for Dekada '70 in 2003, De Leon became the most nominated actor at the Gawad Urian Awards. He has won Best Actor twice for his roles in Ikaw ay Akin (1977) and My Other Woman (1990). Two films co-starring De Leon, Ganito Kami Noon... Paano Kayo Ngayon? (1976) and Dekada '70 (2002), have been submitted as official entry of the Philippines to the Academy Awards for a possible nomination for \"Best International Feature Film.\"\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nChristopher de Leon at IMDb",

Incumbent Governor Andrey Bocharov is running to a third term in office.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThen-All-Russia People's Front executive committee chairman and former State Duma member Andrey Bocharov was appointed acting Governor of Volgograd Oblast in April 2014, replacing first-term Governor Sergey Bozhenov, who served in office for just two years. Bocharov easily won the election for a full term in September 2014 with 88.49% of the vote. Bocharov ran for a second term in 2019 and overwhelmingly won again with 76.80% of the vote against three registered opponents.\nInitially the Governor of Volgograd Oblast was limited for just two consecutive terms so Bocharov would have been term-limited in 2024. However, in December 2021 \"On Common Principles of Organisation of Public Authority in the Subjects of the Russian Federation\" law was enacted, which lifted term limits for Russian governors. Volgograd Oblast followed suit and lifted the restrictions, which allowed Bocharov to seek another term in 2024.\nIn April 2024 during a meeting with President Vladimir Putin Governor Bocharov announced his intention to run for a second term and received Putin's endorsement. \n\n\n== Candidates ==\nIn Volgograd Oblast candidates for Governor can be nominated only by registered political parties. Candidate for Governor of Volgograd Oblast should be a Russian citizen and at least 30 years old. Candidates for Governor should not have a foreign citizenship or residence permit. Each candidate in order to be registered is required to collect at least 5% of signatures of members and heads of municipalities. Also gubernatorial candidates present 3 candidacies to the Federation Council and election winner later appoints one of the presented candidates.\n\n\n=== Declared ===\nAndrey Bocharov (United Russia), incumbent Governor of Volgograd Oblast (2014–present)\n\n\n== See also ==\n2024 Russian regional elections\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Johan Carl Modeweg (25 March 1782 – 20 August 1849) was a Danish industrialist who founded the textile company J. C. Modeweg & Søn. From 1831 his company was based at Brede Works in Kongens Lyngby, north of Copenhagen.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nModeweg was born on 25 March 1782 in Copenhagen, the son of clockmaker Tobias Modeweg (1757–1801) and Marie Sørensdatter (c. 1746–1818). His mother was first married to clockmaker Michael Peter Beck, c. 1744–80. His father was born in Magdeburg but came to Denmark by way of Sweden.\n\n\n== Career ==\nModeweg established a grocery business in Copenhagen in 1804 or 1805 but had to close it after a few years. In 1809, after a bankrupt master tableclothmaker, he acquired nine handlooms. On 27 January 1810, he obtained a royal license to establish and operate a cloth factory in Copenhagen. His company prospered during the war with England and the Danish state bankruptcy in 1813. In early 1820, when a fire in early 1820 destroyed both his property and its inventories, he, an interest-free loan enabled him to import modern machinery and. On trips abroad, he studied the latest manufacturing methods.\n\nIn 1811, together with Theodor Suhr, he was able to buy Brede Works from Ernst Schimmelmann's heirs. While Suhr continued to run the copper works for a time, Modeweg took over most of the land and the main building as a new home for his textile factory. The factory was initially operated by water power from Mølleåen. Later, a small steam engine was acquired.\nIn 1838, Modeweg made his son Julius Emil Modeweg (1813–69) a partner in the firm. Its name was subsequently changed to J. C. Modeweg & Søn.\n\n\n== Personal life and legacy ==\n\nModeweg was married on 2 September 1805 in Trinitatis Church to Marie Magdalene Louise Bock (1783–1843). She was the daughter of tobacco spinner Johan Carl Bock (1750–1805) and Frederikke Lovise Braad (ca. 1752–1786). After the death of his first wife, on 25 September 1844 in Lyngby he married to Petrine Nicoline Tangen (1807–1880). She was the daughter of sailing master Hans Gullich Tangen and Johanne Elisabeth Franck.\nModeweg died on 20 August 1849. He is buried at Copenhagen's Assistens Cemetery.\nThe company was continued by Julius Modeweg. In 1844, he acquired the remaining part of Vrede Worls. His widow Anna Elisabeth, Modeweg (née Gudmann) sold the company in 1872 to the wholesalers Carl Albeck (1830–1905) and William Salomonsen (1842–1900).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJohan Carl Modeweg at geni.com",

        "content": "William Mann (1817–1873) was an English astronomer active at Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope, where he erected a new transit-circle in 1855 and made valuable observations.\n\n\n== Life ==\nWilliam Mann was born at Lewisham in Kent on 25 October 1817. He was third son of Major-general Cornelius Mann, R.E., and grandson of Gother Mann, and accompanied his family to Gibraltar in 1830, on his father's appointment as commanding-royal engineer. In 1837 Admiral Shirreff procured him the post of second assistant at the Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope, and after due preparation he entered upon his duties in October 1839. For six years he was engaged chiefly on the remeasurement of Lacaille's arc, and sometimes passed three months without shelter even by night. His health, impaired by hardships, was recruited by a trip to England in 1846, and on his return in December 1847 he engaged, as first assistant, in the ordinary work of the observatory. His next voyage home was for the purpose of fetching the new transit-circle, erected by him at the Cape in 1855 with the aid of native labour. His observations of the great comet of December 1844, and of the transit of Mercury on 4 November 1868, were communicated to the Royal Astronomical Society, of which body he was elected a member on 10 March 1871. From a chest disorder, contracted through assiduity in cometary observations, he sought relief at Natal in 1866, in England in 1867, but was attacked in 1870 with debilitating effect by scarlet fever, of which two of his children had just died. He retired from the observatory, and died at Claremont, near Cape Town, on 30 April 1873.\n\n\n=== Personal ===\nHe married in 1863 Caroline, second daughter of Sir Thomas Maclear. The value for three years of a small pension, granted to him from the civil list on the eve of his death, was paid to her by Gladstone's orders. \n\n\n== Appraisal ==\nAccording to Agnes Mary Clerke, writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, \"Mann's character and abilities were superior to his opportunities. He was a good mathematician and mechanician\". Mann's fellow-assistant, Professor Piazzi Smyth, once wrote of his \"splendid intellectual parts and excellent dispositions\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nClerke, A.

        "content": "The Cretan expedition occurred in Autumn 828, where the Byzantine army invaded the island of Crete which was held by the Arabs. The expedition ended in fiasco for the Byzantine army.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn 824 or 827, Andalusian fugitives were expelled from Alexandria and left for the island of Crete. The fugitive leader, Abu Hafs occupied the island. He founded the city of Chandax which became its capital. The Byzantines were aware of the danger Crete poses to them. Soon they dispatched an expedition led by Damianos and Photenious but were defeated.\n\n\n== Expedition ==\nIn Autumn of 828, the Byzantine emperor, Michael II, dispatched another fleet of 70 ships under the strategos of Kivirraioton, Craterus of Cibyrrahaeot. The Byzantines landed at Amnisos where the Arabs were waiting for them. A bloody and fierce battle ensued on the coast where the Byzantines routed the Arabs, killing and taking many prisoners. Those who survived the battle escaped to Chandax. The Byzantines, instead of following up their success, chose to establish their camp and celebrate their victory. They neglected the defense of their camp. At the night, the Arabs launched a sortie against the sleeping Byzantines who were taken by surprise. The Byzantines were subsequently massacred and their ships were captured. Craterus escaped on a merchant ship. However; the Arabs chased him to the island of Kos where he was captured and crucified.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nIt became clear after this victory that the Arabs had come to inhabit Crete. That year, 828, they had total control over the island. The battle changed the naval balance of power in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Arabs made frequent and destructive assaults against the coastlines of the Aegean Sea.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nJohn Bagnell Bury (1965), A History of the Eastern Roman Empire from the Fall of Irene to the Accession of Basil I.

        "content": "Lesueuria vitrea is a species of comb jelly in the family Bolinopsidae. It is the type species of the genus Lesueuria and is found in the Mediterranean Sea. Its type specimen was collected in the Bay of Nice.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nLesueuria vitrea was first described by French zoologist Henri Milne-Edwards in 1841, when it was designated as the type species of the newly established genus Lesueuria. Over the next century, several other zoologists collected or viewed the species and included it in their lists. Alessandro Spagnolini in 1870 believed the species may be what is now called Bolinopsis infundibulum, William M'Intosh claimed to have found it in Scotland in 1888, and Fanny Moser expanded the genus by adding L. hyboptera and L. tiedemanni in 1908. Ole Theodor Jensen Mortensen agreed with Spagnolini in 1912, theorizing that L. vitrea was either a rare deep sea species, a heteromorphic form of B. infundibulum, or specimens of B. infundibulum that lost most of their lobes through damage or mutilation. In 1957, Lesueuria vitrea was included in a species compendium, but with the note non revue depuis — \"never seen again\" since its first description. A series of dive explorations in 1957 in the Bay of Nice, where the species was originally reported, did not find any specimens; they did, however, find several of Bolinopsis hydatina in the range. The genus Lesueuria was assigned to the family Bolinopsidae in 1995.\nDespite its status as the name-bearing type of the genus Lesueuria, Milne-Edwards did not submit any of the type material of the species for preservation or study. Because of the likelihood that it is in fact a mutilated member of the genus Bolinopsis, the name Lesueuria vitrea is considered uncertain, or a nomen dubium, by the World Register of Marine Species.\n\n\n== Description ==\nIn Milne-Edwards' original description, he noted the species' four auricles which look like ribbons, and its simple oral lobes. He also described a sensory organ but was unable to identify its exact nature. He interpreted several fibers that radiated from the organ as nerve structures, but they were later determined to be unrelated muscle fibers.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nChun, Carl (1877). \"Das Nervensystem und die Muskulatur der Rippenquallen\".

Incumbent Governor Valery Limarenko is running to a second term in office.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn September 2018 Governor of Sakhalin Oblast Oleg Kozhemyako was appointed acting Governor of Primorsky Krai after a political crisis that followed the 2018 gubernatorial election and the resignation of previous acting Governor Andrey Tarasenko. Vera Shcherbina, Chairwoman of the Sakhalin Oblast Government, served as acting Governor until December 2018 when Atomstroyexport president Valery Limarenko was appointed instead by President Vladimir Putin.\nLimarenko, despite being a member of United Russia party, ran for a full term as an Independent and faced a spirited challenge from Communist State Duma member from Primorsky Krai Aleksey Korniyenko. Former State Duma member and 2015 gubernatorial runner-up Svetlana Ivanova failed to secure support from CPRF and ran as an Independent but was unable to pass the municipal filter. Limarenko won September 2019 gubernatorial election with 56.14% of the vote with Korniyenko placing second with 24.21%. It was the closest gubernatorial election that cycle.\nIn April 2024 during a meeting with President Vladimir Putin Governor Limarenko announced his intention to run for a second term and received Putin's endorsement. \n\n\n== Candidates ==\nIn Sakhalin Oblast candidates for Governor can be nominated by registered political parties or by self-nomination. Candidate for Governor of Sakhalin Oblast should be a Russian citizen and at least 30 years old. Candidates for Governor should not have a foreign citizenship or residence permit. Each candidate in order to be registered is required to collect at least 10% of signatures of members and heads of municipalities. In addition, self-nominated candidates should collect 0.5% of signatures of Sakhalin Oblast residents. Also gubernatorial candidates present 3 candidacies to the Federation Council and election winner later appoints one of the presented candidates.\n\n\n=== Declared ===\nValery Limarenko (United Russia), incumbent Governor of Sakhalin Oblast (2018–present)\n\n\n== See also ==\n2024 Russian regional elections\n\n\n== References ==",

As the modern historian T.Sultanov has established, these 92 \"tribes\" include \"the names of the majority of Turkic and some non—Turkic ethnic groups that inhabited Central Asia at that time\".\nThere is a legend that 92 people went to Medina, where they took part in the war of the Prophet Muhammad against the kafirs and were converted to Islam by Saint Shah-i Mardan. Of these 92 people, according to legend, the \"Uzbek\" tribes supposedly originated, which are also called in the text by the common name ilatiya.\nTo date, more than 18 lists of 92 Uzbek tribes are known, and all of them are compiled on the territory of Transoxiana, that is, the oases of the Central Asian basins of two rivers: Syr Darya and Amu Darya. The earliest list dates back to the XVI century, and the latest to the beginning of the XX century. One of the lists was recorded by N. V. Khanykov, who was in Bukhara in 1841.\nAnalyzing the lists of Uzbek tribes, it can be noted that most of them begin with the names of three tribes: Ming, Yuz and Qyrq.\nThere was also the Desht-i Qipchak Uzbek tribe Uyshun (Uysun), whose groups are known in the Tashkent and Samarkand oases, traces their origin to the Wusuns. Among Uzbeks, the Usun tribe is considered one of the most ancient among 92 Uzbek tribes and enjoyed certain privileges.\nOne of the lists of 92 Uzbek tribes compiled in Transoxiana lists tribes that lived in the oases of Central Asia long before the conquest of the region by Sheibani Khan. For example, in the list of manuscript 4330.3 from the collection of the Institute of Oriental Studies of Uzbekistan, you can find such types as: barlas, katagan, kipchak, uz, naiman, etc.\nThe poet Alisher Navoi in his works written in the XV century mentioned the ethnonym \"Uzbek\" as the name of one of the ethnic groups of Mawara al-Nahr.\nThe poet of the XVII century Turdy wrote about the ethnonym Uzbek as a unifying name for 92 tribes in Central Asia.\n\n\n== Notable people from some Uzbek tribes ==\n\n\n=== Mings ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Manghits ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Qungrads ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Yuz ===\nOgahi (full name is Muhammad Riza Erniyozbek oglu) (17.12.1809 - 14.12.1874) - Uzbek poet, historian, translator.\nMunis Xorazmiy (full name: son of Shermuhammad Amir Avazbi) (1778 - Qiyat village near Khiva - 1829) is an Uzbek poet, historian, translator, and calligrapher.\nMuhammadali Ahmedov - (born on March 1, 1942 in the Boz district of Andijan (now Boston)) is a poet, writer, scientist, translator, pedagogue and public figure.\n\n\n=== Arlot ===\nAbdul-Qādir Bedil — was an Indian Sufi, and considered one of the greatest Indo-Persian poets.

        "content": "Yashil yarpagh- a journal published in 1928 by Azerbaijani political refugees living in Turkey.\n\n\n== About ==\nThe \"Yashil Yarpagh\" journal, published on June 16, 1928, was the third journal published by Azerbaijani refugees. It was less significant in terms of volume and influence compared to the journals \"Yeni Kafkasya\" and \"Azeri Turk.\" The journal's address was listed as follows: Istanbul, Hilali-Əhmər street, across from Hagia Sophia. It was published by the \"Orkhaniyya\" press. The first article in the journal is titled \"Ten years behind us.\" The second issue was released on July 5, 1928. The journal consisted of 8 pages and its final issue was published on September 1, 1928. Mammad Sadıq Aran was the chief editor of the journal. Additionally, signatures of Erdoğan and Sisyanlı were also found in the journal.\nIn the header section of the journal, the statement \"Published every 15 days with the pen of industrious Azerbaijanis, it is a public, political, independent nationalist magazine\" is included.\n\n\n=== Purpose ===\nIn the article \"Yolumuz\" published in the first issue of the Yaşıl Yarpaq journal, the purpose of the journal is stated in the following words:\n\nToday, another small journal enters the life of the press. In this journal, which comes to the agenda with the assistance of young Azerbaijani writers, shortcomings may be observed. Our journal will strive to eliminate the shortcomings it allows through the goodwill and kindness of its esteemed readers. The \"Yashil yarpagh\" is published to convey the sorrows of the unfortunate Azerbaijan living under the chain of oppression to the watching world, which has been ignited by tragedy for years.\nUnder pressure from the Soviet leadership, just like the journals \"Yeni Kafkasya\" and \"Azeri Turk\" the \"Yashil Yarpagh\" journal was also closed shortly after its short-lived publication. Since there were no changes in the editorial team, the main topic of the journal was the pressure of the Soviet leadership not only on the Russians but also on other nationalities, and this situation was seriously criticized by the journal.\nIn the article titled \"On Years Behind Us,\" featured in the first issue, the changes in the past ten years since Azerbaijan gained independence in 1918 are explained:\n\n\"Having broken the century-old chain of oppression to achieve freedom and independence, the Azerbaijani Turks' declaration of independence marked its tenth anniversary on May 28th of the past year. Only those who witnessed the event can truly appreciate how this declaration was made in a challenging period after passing through difficult stages. Despite all its losses, the four million-strong Turkish Azerbaijan managed to restore its usurped rights against the hundred million-strong Russian masses and earned the honor of establishing the first national and civil Turkish republic with all the conditions and innovations of the century.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "May Nagmamahal Sa'yo, internationally released as Madonna and Child, is a 1996 Philippine drama film directed by Marilou Diaz-Abaya from a screenplay written by Ricky Lee and Shaira Mella Salvador. Starring Lorna Tolentino, Ariel Rivera, and Stefano Mori, the film revolves around a woman who returned from working overseas and began to search for her missing son whom she gave up for adoption at the orphanage years earlier. It also stars Claudine Barretto, Gina Pareño, Renato del Prado, Jaclyn Jose, Tom Taus Jr., Emman Abeleda, Rolando Tinio, Archie Adamos, and Lilia Cuntapay.\nProduced and released by Star Cinema, the film was theatrically released in the Philippines on 25 January 1996. It was later screened in film festivals and retrospective events worldwide, including in Hong Kong on 27 March 1996, as part of the 20th Hong Kong International Film Festival, in Japan on 15 September 1996, as one of the exhibited Filipino films for the 6th Fukuoka International Film Festival, and in Germany on 26 June 1999, as part of the tribute to the director at the Munich International Film Festival.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1988, Louella, a woman living in the town of Talisay, Batangas, gave up her son to the care of Father Nicandro at the orphanage to work overseas as a domestic helper. Seven years after she served there in Hong Kong, she returned to her hometown, only to be welcomed by her uncle Boy and younger sister Janine but ignored by her mother Rosing because she threw Louella out when she found that Louella was impregnated and later, dumped by a traveling businessman. While fetching Janine from school, she reunites with Nestor, the town's policeman. The following day, Louella returns to the same place where she gave Leonard up for adoption but Father Cortez and Manang Ofel, the current parish priest and one of Father Nicandro's assistants, respectively, inform her that Leonard and other children were transferred to Hospicio de San Agustin in Pasig.\nThe search for her son begins with Louella going to Pasig, only to find out that the orphanage was demolished. Nestor, who later joins her search, tells Louella that the orphans, including Leonard, were transferred to other orphanages including the two mentioned from the information he gathered. In an unnamed orphanage located in Lipa the two discover that the children in the said facility have disabilities, which Leonard didn't have when he was born. One morning, she receives a mail from an employment agency that she is assigned to work again in Hong Kong. The search continues when they visit Hospicio de San Cristobal in Tagaytay and there, Louella meets a boy named Conrad who is humming the same melody as the one she did for her missing son.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\n\nFor director Marilou Diaz-Abaya, May Nagmamahal Sa'yo is the third film she directed for ABS-CBN's film production arm, Star Cinema, following Ang Ika-11 na Utos: Mahalin Mo ang Asawa Mo, which was co-produced with Regal Films, in 1994 and Kapag May Katwiran... Ipaglaban Mo!: The Movie, which became a box-office success, in 1995. Because of the latter's success, Abaya accepted another project offered by the studio and teamed up again with Ricky Lee, her longtime screenwriting collaborator, who co-wrote the screenplay with fellow screenwriter Shaira Mella Salvador. In contrast to her previous films that deal with and depict women who were oppressed and victimized, May Nagmamahal Sa'yo depicts the life and motherhood of Louella, played by Lorna Tolentino, as well as talking about the topic of adoption.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nNoel Vera, writing for The Manila Chronicle in 1996, described the film as \"enthralling\" and gave praise to all aspects featured throughout the work, particularly the acting performances of the cast including Lorna Tolentino, Jaclyn Jose, Gina Pareño, and Stefano Mori, Ricky Lee and Shaira Mella Salvador's screenplay, and the direction done by Marilou Diaz-Abaya.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMay Nagmamahal Sa'yo (Madonna and Child) at IMDb",

        "content": "The  Church of St. George (Rečane) was a small Serbian Orthodox Church, located in the village of Rečane, Kosovo. It belonged to the Diocese of Raška and Prizren of the Serbian Orthodox Church.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt is unknown exactly when the church was built, however a tombstone inscription on the floor of the church suggests that the church was built before 1370. The church plan and building method were built in line with the Serbo-Byzantine style of architecture, a style common in the 14th century. It is purported that the church was commissioned in the name of an unknown Serbian military vojvoda who was buried on the church grounds. This is further supported by the fact that the church was consecrated in the name of Saint George, a highly venerated saint among the Serbian military nobility at the time. Two restoration works were completed in the 20th century, one in 1926 and another from 1956 to 1960. In 1953, the church was classified as a cultural monument and placed under state protection.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe church was small in size, consisting of a reduced cross-in-square layout with three bays and a dome. The façade was rendered in stone with added brickwork and ceramoplastic elements in the upper sections. \n\n\n== Frescoes ==\nDespite being small in size, the church was notable for its frescoes and architecture. The frescoes had a recurring theme of military saints. However, the placement of frescoes and choice of saints were in line with those depicted in other churches from the same time period. The life of St George was depicted in the second zone of the western bay. This included his life before martyrdom, discussions with his father, the destruction of gold and silver idols and, him giving his wealth away. The frescoes were painted by two painters in the 14th century, however evidence of fire damage was noted which impacted the visual appearance of the frescoes to a minor degree. \n\n\n== Destruction ==\nIn 1999, following the arrival of KFOR troops after the end of the Kosovo War, the church was burned and later completely demolished with explosives by extremist Kosovo Albanians. A collection of both black and white and colour photographs of the church frescoes and building was collected in the 1980s. The collection serves as the only evidence of the church existing. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMinistria e Kulturës, Rinisë dhe Sportit - Kisha e Shën Gjergjit në Reçanë (Suharekë)",

        "content": "Sukhwinder Singh Sangha (3 February 1965 - November 3 1990) was a Sikh Kharku and head of a faction of Bhindranwale Tiger Force of Khalistan. Sangha was a popular Kharku, known for his help of civilians. He was awarded the title of the \"20th-century Hari Singh Nalwa\" by Damdami Taksal and other Sikh Jathas.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nSukhwinder Singh Sangha was born on February 3, 1965, to Gulzar Singh and Mahinder Kaur in the village Sangha near Tarn Taran. He was the eldest of 5 siblings. Sangha was born in a farming family and became a farmer at a young age. Sangha took Amrit at a young age. Sangha received a Bachelor of Fine Arts at Sri Guru Arjan Dev College.\nSangha began listening to Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale's speeches and sermons and soon after joined Amrik Singh's All India Sikh Student Federation. During Dharam Yudh Morcha Sangha courted arrest in protest. Sangha was kept in Ludhiana prison. Sangha was released, but arrested once more after Operation Blue Star. He would be released later.\n\n\n== Early actions ==\nSukhwinder Singh Sangha began his militancy after his second release. Sangha took part in multiple militant gatherings and associated himself with Ranjit Singh Rana Thru and did multiple militant activities in the Majha area. Thru, Sangha, and a group of around other 15 Kharkus were involved in the robbing of a Home Guard and Railway Police armory on February 16, 1986. They took 16 rifles and 440 cartridges of ammunitions. Thru, and Sangha were also involved in killings of looters in Majha.\n\n\n== Bhindranwale Tiger Force of Khalistan ==\nOn August 25, 1987, Rana Thru was killed in a police encounter leaving Sangha alone. Sangha soon met Gurbachan Singh Manochahal, the head of Bhindranwale Tiger Force of Khalistan. Sangha joined BTFK and became its Lieutenant General. Sangha led the day-to-day operations of BTFK and led 50-80 Kharkus. Around this time Sangha made a statement in the press appealing for Kharkus to not be involved in \"personal problems\", to not harass \"innocents\", and to use weapons against \"tyrants\" and not to \"cause terrorism\". Sangha also appealed for people to see Kharkus as \"brothers\" and not \"terrorists\". Sangha also reveled that his father had been murdered and said he did not join the movement to kill \"personnel enemies\" and said he would not do anything until \"evidence has been revealed\".\nOn January 26, 1988, Sangha claimed responsibility for killing 8 Black Cats. Sangha alleged in a press note that the 8 had sent letters in his name attempting to extort people. Sangha said that they were killed as they went to take 500,000 rupees from a family they had sent extortion letters to.\nSukhwinder Singh Sangha claimed responsibility for killing 2 Homeguards in Dublia on March 20, 1989.

        "content": "Inche Mohamed Sidik bin Haji Abdul Hamid (born 1896 or 1897), commonly known as Inche Sidik, was a Singaporean politician. He was a member of Malay Union before he left in 1957 and joined the Singapore branch of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO). He was the Member of Parliament (MP) representing Southern Islands Constituency from 1955 to 1959. He also served as the Assistant Education Minister.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHe was born at Bussorah Street (now known as Sultan Road) and went to Raffles Institution. He worked as a clerk. He spent 33 years working at the Customs Department as a senior preventive officer.\nSidik was also the vice-president of the south zone of the Malay Football Association of Malaya and the president of the Malay Union.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1952, Sidik and members of the Malay Union protested against the construction of a park in Geylang. In 1954, Sidik stated that the Malay Union had not joined Labour Front.\nIn 1955, he contested in the 1955 Singaporean general election for Southern Islands Constituency. He was the only candidate of the Malay Union to be participating. He became the Member of Parliament (MP) representing Southern Islands Constituency after he won with 50.57% of the vote against Progressive Party member Hollupatherage James Caldera Kulasingha, who got 49.43%. Sidik also won with the narrowest margin of just 1.15%.\nIn 1956, he left the Malay Union after serving as its president for four years. This happened after he and Inche H. M. Hassan donated a refrigerator to the Singapore branch of the British Red Cross under their names instead of the Malay Union's. He was succeeded by Tengku Ismara Raja after he lost to with 17 votes compared to his 26. After he left, he joined the Singapore branch of the United Malays National Organisation (UNMO).\nAfterwards, Sidik stated that he was still the representative of the Malay Union despite leaving as he was elected on the union's ticket. In 1958, he opened Hua Yi Middle School.\nDuring the 1959 Singaporean general election, he contested in Siglap Single Member Constituency against 7 other candidates. He had originally wanted to contest in Southern Islands Constituency again, but lost his nomination to Inche Ahmad Jabri by four votes. During his rally speech, he stated that there would be \"no happiness if [People's Action Party] comes into power.\" He was unsuccessful, only garnering 11.05% of the vote.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Warsingsfehn is a village in the region of East Frisia, in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is the capital of the municipality of Moormerland. Warsingsfehn is located just to the north of Veenhusen and is approximately 9 kilometers to the north of Leer. With a population of 7,951, it is the most populated village of the municipality.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe village of Warsingsfehn was created as a moor colony in the 18th century. The village was flooded during the Christmas Flood of 1717 and was then moved to its current, higher location. The birth of the peat colony of Warsingsfehn is considered to be 16 November 1736. On this date, landowner Gerhard Warsing received a leasehold of a raised moor area of 225 hectares. Under his son Hermann Warsing, the lease area was expanded again: in 1769 by 50 hectares, in 1776 by 62 hectares, and in 1779 by ten hectares.\nThe Warsings gave out the properties on the canal and side canals that branched off at right angles to subleaseholders. They cultivated the moor by first removing the upper layer of white peat and then digging out the black peat underneath to serve as fuel. The peat was then transported by barge to the surrounding cities, especially Emden and Leer, as heating material. After the black peat layer was excavated, the white peat layer was placed back on the moor soil. Since it has little yield, it was mixed with animal dung from the marshes of East Frisia and fertilized in this way. However, the moor settlers were usually only able to make a modest living.\nMany people from Warsingsfehn therefore switched to shipping early on. While in 1751 there were five smaller peat ships and four other inland waterway ships on the Warsingsfehn canals, the number had already risen to 31 peat ships by 1816. However, to generate additional sources of income, the captains also sailed in small sea transport between ports on the North Sea coast. In 1816, Warsingsfehn was also home to twelve seagoing ships in addition to the peat ships. By the end of the 19th century, their number had risen to a total of 82, before the advent of steam shipping gave the small sailors competition, against which they could not compete. In addition to the captains and owners, many sailors from Warsingsfehn also went to sea.\nAgriculture, which was mostly part-time anyway, could not feed the residents less and less. Between 1816 and 1831 alone, the cultivated area increased from 90 to 205 hectares. At the end of the 19th century, however, there was hardly any moorland left that could be cultivated. There was therefore a wave of emigration to the United States, especially in the last three decades of the 19th century, with more than 100 inhabitants leaving their village.\nDue to the social structure (moor colonists, sailors), there was clear support for the SPD in Warsingsfehn since the emergence of the workers' movement, and then also for the Communist Party in the Weimar Republic. However, especially since the May 1924 German federal election, this was always offset by a significant share of votes from right-wing parties. In the July 1932 German federal election, the NSDAP was 50 percent ahead of the SPD (25.2 percent) and the KPD (17 percent) combined. In the second place, however, was the strictly evangelical Christian Social People's Service.\nDuring the National Socialist era, officials from the SPD and KPD were exposed to political persecution. Nine people whose place of birth or residence was Warsingsfehn were killed in the concentration camps Auschwitz, Sobibor, and Kauen.\nOn the occasion of the Lower Saxony municipal reform, Warsingsfehn was united with the surrounding communities on 1 January 1973 to form the new large municipality of Moormerland. When it came to the question of the location of the municipal administration, Warsingsfehn prevailed over the neighboring town of Neermoor: although Warsingsfehn is one of the youngest towns in the municipality of Moormerland, it had already grown into by far the largest in the early 1970s.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Human-oriented sexualism (対人性愛中心主義 (taijin-seiai-chūshin-shugi)) is the concept that sexual attraction towards flesh-and-blood human is \"normal\" sexuality. This is the term used to describe the marginalization of fictosexuality. The sexuality attracted to real human is called \"human-oriented sexuality.\" While the concept is raised from fictosexuality studies in Japan, it is now being discussed in research outside of Japan and in areas other than fictosexuality studies.\n\n\n== Etymology and background ==\nHuman-oriented sexuality (対人性愛 (taijin-seiai) is the term used to describe the sexual majority attracted to flesh-and-blood people. This term emerged from grassroots usage among those who prefer two-dimensional sexual creations like manga and anime, yet lack sexual attraction to flesh-and-blood individuals. Based on this premise, the term \"human-oriented sexualism\" was coined, prompting inquiries into institutions, customs, and value judgments rooted in human-oriented sexuality.\nTwo-dimensional characters are non-human entities; they are not representations of humans but belong to a distinct category separate from humans. Sexuality attracted to two-dimensional characters represents an alternative \"sexual orientation,\" distinct from attraction to flesh-and-blood humans. However, under human-oriented sexualism, such sexuality is often rendered invisible.\nThe concept of human-oriented sexualism can be understood as a combination of the idea of compulsory sexuality from asexual research and the notion of humanonormativity from objectum sexuality research. This concept is often used as similar to the amatonormativity.\n\n\n== Academic research ==\n\n\n=== Queer studies ===\nAccording to queer theorist Yuu Matsuura, human-oriented sexualism is closely related to heteronormativity. Human-oriented sexualism erases the possibility of segmenting sexuality in ways other than the \"heterosexual/homosexual\" category, thus serving as a precondition for the exclusion of homosexuality. Heteronormativity is positioned as a combination of gender binarism and human-oriented sexualism. Furthermore, it has been observed that human-oriented sexualism shares roots with transphobia, operating within the same structural framework.\nKazuki Fujitaka, associate professor of feminist/queer studies at Kyoto Sangyo University, highly appreciated Matsuura's theory about critique against human-oriented sexualism and described the theory as \"a practice of healing those who get hurt by a normative society and of defamiliarizing the world,\" akin to what bell hooks calls \"theory as liberatory practice.\"\n\n\n=== Fan or otaku ===\nIn the field of research on otaku and manga studies, there exists a lineage of debates that contest human-oriented sexualism. Matsuura cites examples such as the \"ethics of moe\" proposed by Patrick W. Galbraith, the feminist analysis of yaoi by Yukari Fujimoto, the concept of \"multiple orientations\" advanced by Tamaki Saitō, and Elizabeth Miles' investigation into sexual desire for two dimensional characters as a \"third sexual orientation.\" In philosopher Haruka Tsutsui's study of \"Oshi,\" the potential for non-human-oriented sexuality is discussed as a potential subversion of patriarchal sexual norms facilitated by fan activities.\n\n\n=== Obscenity law ===\nResearch on the distribution of obscene materials  expresses concerns regarding the regulation of two-dimensional sexual creations. Applying the same logic as that used for regulating the public display of genitalia and sexual acts of real people would imply that two-dimensional sexual expressions are unconditionally considered representations of real flesh and blood. Consequently, two-dimensional sexual expressions might be interpreted as stimulating the desire for sexual intercourse with real people.\nSimilarly, Matsuura's research on child pornography regulations has criticized the inclusion of two-dimensional sexual creations within such regulations. This criticism arises from the perception that such inclusion aligns with an ethical judgment rooted in human-oriented sexuality, as it implicitly disregards the ontological difference between humans and two-dimensional characters.\n\n\n=== Intimacy and family ===\nThe notion that intimate or familial relationships with non-humans, such as AI, robots, and pets, are considered inferior to relationships between humans is discussed as a manifestation of human-oriented sexualism.\n\n\n== Activism ==\nAn organization that critiques human-oriented sexualism is the Taiwan Entrepot of Fictosexuality, a Taiwanese fictosexual activist organization. Discussions and movements criticizing human-oriented sexualism are aligned with solidarity with feminism and LGBTQ rights, while simultaneously raising criticisms of human-oriented sexualism within feminist and queer circles. Additionally, it has been noted that movements opposing restrictions on two-dimensional sexual creations, such as manga and anime, also serve as a critique against the human-oriented sexualist legal system.\n\n\n== Explanatory notes ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nFictosexuality\nNijikon\nHeteronormativity\nAmatonormativity\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Battle of Caesarea occurred in 1073 when the Seljuk Turks defeated a Byzantine force near Caesarea who were led by Isaac Komnenos and his brother, Alexios. Isaac was captured during the battle.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter the battle of Manzikert, the new emperor, Michael VII Doukas, had appointed a new Domestikos in 1073, Isaac Komnenos along his brother, Alexios, and Roussel de Bailleul, to deal with the Seljuk invasion who were infesting Anatolia. Roussel, a second in command, had a mercenary force of 400 Frankish men. While the Byzantine army marching to meet the Seljuks, soon an argument between Isaac and Roussel flared up, leading to Roussel abandoning the Byzantine camp with his men. The Byzantine had already arrived in Kayseri where the Seljuk army was approaching.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nUpon learning of the 400 Franks' flight, Isaac briefly considered dispatching a troop under the command of his brother Alexios to hunt them down. However, word soon spread that a Seljuk force was on its way. Isaac traveled to the Cappadocian frontier to meet the Seljuks, leaving Alexios in charge of a small guard to watch over the Byzantine camp.\nIsaac attacked the Seljuks, however, the Byzantines were overwhelmed and ambushed by the large number of the Seljuks, many of his men were killed and taken prisoners. Isaac fell from his horse after attempting to stop his men from retreating only to be taken prisoner by the Seljuks.\nThe Seljuks then attacked the Byzantine camp. Alexios tried to raise to troops moral, only to find himself abandoned by his men and therefore forced to retreat. the Seljuks looted the camp and its baggage. Alexios retreated to Ankara.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAt Ankara, Alexios learned about his brother's fate. Isaac managed to ransom himself along number of hostages and follow up with his brother at Ankara.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nMarek Meško (2023), Alexios I Komnenos in the Balkans, 1081–1095.[1]\nOsman Aziz Basan (2010), The Great Seljuqs, A History.[2]\nAlexander Daniel Beihammer (2017), Byzantium and the Emergence of Muslim-Turkish Anatolia, Ca. 1040–1130.[3]\nFranz Georg F. von Kausler (1829), Dictionary of battles, sieges and meetings of all peoples. 4 vols.

        "content": "Volodymyr Ilyich Kozyavkin (Ukrainian: Володи́мир Іллі́ч Козя́вкін; 9 June 1947 – 16 December 2022) was a Ukrainian physician and scientist who earned the title of Hero of Ukraine in 2001. As the medical director of LLC International Rehabilitation Clinic Kozyavkin, he specialized in the fields of neurology and medical rehabilitation.\nKozyavkin's groundbreaking Kozyavkin Method approach of intense neurophysiological therapy is used worldwide to treat individuals with organic nervous system disorders and cerebral palsy. Owing to its efficacy, this rehabilitation approach has garnered widespread worldwide recognition and is legally recognized in Ukraine.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBorn on 9 June 1947, in the Ukrainian village of Ostrozhets. He went to No.8 School (Duben Gymnasium No. 2). Kozyavkin received his degree from the Grodno Medical Institute's medical faculty in 1971.\n\n\n== Medical career ==\nKozyavkin was first employed as a physician at the Brest Psychiatric Hospital and then at the Dubna ambulance station. He then worked in the Moscow departmental clinic of TASS, doing scientific and medical work. He authored two PhD theses: \"Structural and functional disorders of cerebral and spinal structures in cerebral palsy and the rehabilitation system of these patients\" (1996) and \"Manual therapy in the rehabilitation of cerebral palsy patients\" (1992).\nKozyavkin has been the Lviv Rehabilitation Center Elita director in March 1990, the Institute of Medical Rehabilitation Problems in 1996, and the International Clinic of Rehabilitation in 2003. He was elected to the post of professor in 1999 in the P.L. Shupyk National Medical Academy of Postgraduate Education's Department of Medical Rehabilitation and Balneology. The Institute of Medical Rehabilitation Problems in Truskavets was established as a branch of this department.\nKozyavkin gave a presentation on intense rehabilitation technology from Ukraine in March 2009 at the European Parliament's headquarters in Brussels during the International Conference on Social Adaptation of Persons with Disabilities. A corresponding member of the National Academy of Medical Sciences (NAMS) since December 2011, and later becoming an academician on 16 September 2021.\n\n\n=== Kozyavkin Method ===\nKozyavkin adapted manual therapy procedures for children to fit their unique anatomical and physiological aspects based on his experience as a neurologist, manual therapist, and observer of changes in muscle tone in adults following spinal manipulation. When a new strategy was used in the mid-1980s, the outcome was better than expected: individuals with spastic types of cerebral palsy showed less muscular tone and more movement volume, which was welcomed by medical professionals, patients, and the parents of the ill children.\nWritten by Kozyavkin, the Kozyavkin Method is a technique of intense neurophysiological therapy that has revolutionized the way people with cerebral palsy are treated. Because of its success, the developed rehabilitation method received widespread international acclaim in addition to formal approval in Ukraine. One of the four most successful conservative approaches for cerebral palsy patient rehabilitation was the Kozyavkin Method, according to the 1997 edition of the encyclopedic magazine Kinderorthpedie.\n\n\n== Death ==\nAccording to the presidium of the NAMS of Ukraine, Kozyavkin passed away on 16 December 2022, at the age of 75. The Truskavets City Council expressed profound grief over his passing, recognizing it as an irreparable loss not only for Ukraine and Truskavets but also for the global medical community.\n\n\n== Awards and recognitions ==\n\nIn August 2001, Kozyavkin received the title of Hero of Ukraine with the Order of the State award from the President of Ukraine for his exceptional dedication to the country's advancement of medical research, creation of radically new approaches to treatment, and reintegration of patients with cerebral palsy. In 2017, Professor Kozyavkin's Method was entered in the register of the European Medical Association (EMA) as the best medical practice.\nKozyavkin has received other awards and recognitions such as:\n\n Hero of Ukraine Order of the State (21 August 2001)\n Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise Fifth Class (18 August 2006)\n Order of Merit Third Class (13 May 1997)\n 20 Years of Independence of Ukraine Medal (19 August 2011)\nState Prize of Ukraine in the Field of Architecture (26 July 2005)\nState Prize of Ukraine in Science and Technology (1 December 1999)\nHonored Worker of Science and Technology of Ukraine (29 June 1994)\nHonorary Citizen of Kyiv (2006)\nHonorary Citizen of Dubno (25 July 2003)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "The 2024 Orenburg Oblast gubernatorial election will take place on 8 September 2024, on common election day. Incumbent Governor Denis Pasler is eligible to run to a second term in office.\n\n\n== Background ==\nEnergy executive Denis Pasler, a former Chairman of the Government of Sverdlovsk Oblast (2012–2016) was appointed acting Governor of Orenburg Oblast in March 2019, replacing two-term Governor Yury Berg. Berg's resignation was widely expected as by the end of 2018 Berg was rated among the most unpopular governors in Russia.\nPasler was nominated for full term by United Russia and won the September 2019 gubernatorial election with 65.94% of the vote with Communist Maksim Amelin placing second (23.72%). During the campaign 2014 gubernatorial candidate and LDPR State Duma member Sergey Katasonov initially expressed interest in running for a second time but eventually did not file, while in exchange Pasler renominated LDPR member and incumbent Senator Yelena Afanasyeva.\nIn January 2022 rumours surfaced that Governor Pasler in a short time would resign and return to the private sector, however, Pasler has never actually resigned during 2022. In November 2023 it was again reported that Pasler had considered retirement since at least 2021 and was thought to resign in spring 2024, ahead of the 2024 gubernatorial election. In case of Pasler's early resignation Presidential Administration adviser Aleksandr Sokolov had been considered a potential appointee prior to his nomination as acting Governor of Kirov Oblast in May 2022. Senator Afanasyeva expressed her interest in running for the governor to succeed Pasler in 2024, while some experts view State Duma member Oleg Dimov as the frontrunner for the position.\n\n\n== Candidates ==\nIn Orenburg Oblast candidates for Governor can be nominated only by registered political parties. Candidate for Governor of Orenburg Oblast should be a Russian citizen and at least 30 years old. Candidates for Governor should not have a foreign citizenship or residence permit. Each candidate in order to be registered is required to collect at least 5% of signatures of members and heads of municipalities. Also gubernatorial candidates present 3 candidacies to the Federation Council and election winner later appoints one of the presented candidates.\n\n\n=== Publicly expressed interest ===\nYelena Afanasyeva (LDPR), Senator from Orenburg Oblast (2014–present)\nNina Ostanina (CPRF), Member of State Duma (1995–2011, 2021–present), Chairwoman of the Duma Committee on Family, Motherhood, Fatherhood, and Children (2021–present)\n\n\n=== Potential ===\nOleg Dimov (United Russia), Member of State Duma (2021–present)\nDenis Pasler (United Russia), incumbent Governor of Orenburg Oblast (2019–present)\n\n\n== See also ==\n2024 Russian regional elections\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On April 14, 1942 Kawaguchi Detachment who just landed in Lingayen, Pangasinan intended as reinforcement of the 14th Imperial Japanese Army to finally subdue Philippine-American forces in Bataan. However, General King surrendered days earlier before they arrived. Instead, General Homma Masaharu commander of 14th Army ordered them south to secure Cebu island in the Visayas intended as launching place for invasion of Mindanao after it is secured.\nThe island garrison was neutralized after a few days of fighting as they lacked artillery guns, no anti-aircraft guns, no antitank guns, and limited ammunition. The forces retreated but did not surrender until ordered to do so by General Sharp on May 10, 1942.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe island has 6,500 defending troops under Colonel Irvine Scudder who has Philippine Commonwealth Army units, Philippine Constabulary units, Philippine Army Air Corps unit, and US Navy detachment in Mactan Island. It is also based on Army Transport Service under Lieutenant Colonel Cornelius Byrd, who was responsible for bringing the supplies to Bataan and Corregidor. It has a harbor and Lahug Airfield where a few bombers and fighters to attack the Japanese in Luzon. Homma wanted to use Cebu as a launching pad for the invasion of Mindanao island and secure whatever supplies were available under Army Transport Service.\n\n\n=== Disposition of Cebu Brigade ===\nThe Island is under the command of Colonel Irvine Scudder, who has his command post at Camp Lapulapu in Lahug, Cebu City. It has 82nd Infantry Regiment, which is based in Argao, Cebu, under Colonel Emigdio David. 83rd Infantry Regiment (less 1st Battalion) under Lieutenant Colonel Fortunato Borbon but technically under its senior instruction Lieutenant Colonel Rufus Rogers based in Liloan a northern town of Cebu. The Cebu MP Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel Howard Edmands as former Philippine Constabulary officer. A day during invasion it was transferred to Lieutenant Colonel John D. Cook's command of Cebu East sector command. Just like any other units in  Visayas Islands and Mindanao they do not have a single artillery piece in the island and ammunition is limited.\nVisayan Force Headquarters is also located in Cebu where it was organized a month ago. General Chynoweth and his staff are in Camp X, a Bureau of Forestry compound located in Cantabaco a town in central highway. A few days before the invasion, after getting permission from USFIP HQ he ordered 1st Battalion 83rd Infantry under Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Grimes transferred from Bohol to Cebu to cover Cantabaco and protect Camp X vicinity.\nTwo MP companies were posted in the Mactan Island with a naval detachment under Lieutenant Commander Slimmons, USN, in charge of the island.\n\n\n== Japanese Invasion ==\nOn April 9, 1942, reports of Japanese naval convoy with 4 cruisers and 11 transports from Luzon is spotted south of Panay by a P40 Warhawk fighter who landed in Lahug Field in Cebu has reached Visayan Force Headquarters. General Bradford Chynoweth alerted all his units of imminent invasion of the Japanese in the Visayas Islands.\n\n\n=== Landing in West Coast ===\nMajor General Kawaguchi Kiyotake sent 124th Infantry Regiment to west coast of southern Cebu and landed in Barangay Bato, Pinamungajan, Cebu on April 16. Kawaguchi moved north with tanks and artillery support towards Toledo. Opposing them is 1st Battalion 82nd Infantry under Major Daniel Iway. General Bradford ordered Lieutenant Colonel Grimes to moved forward and repulse Japanese nearing Barangay Uling.\n\n\n=== Landings in East Coast ===\nJapanese sent a group to land in Sibonga, another group landed in San Fernando however it withdraw before Captain Ernest V. Jordan Brigade Operations Officer brought 3rd Battalion 82nd Infantry. Later Japanese landed in Talisay and was opposed by  Cebu MP Regiment. Colonel Edmands MPs initially hold off Japanese at the beaches but Naval fire support made his troops retreated to Cebu City. Colonel Edmands ordered Naval Detachment to start the demolition and the two companies cross back to Cebu through Mandaue pier. However, they cross back through Cebu pier where Japanese also landed the same time.\n\n\n== Visayan Force Headquarters Evacuation ==\nAs the demolition charges placed on bridges failed to detonate and 1st Battalion 83rd Infantry failed to carry its mission in Cantabaco, General Chynoweth and Colonel Scudder decided to evacuate the headquarters to Sudlon, Cebu City. Cebu Brigade evacuated towards Busay, Cebu City and left evacuated supplies in Cebu Sierra Madre Mountains. Chynoweth arranged Colonel Roger Hilsman his Force Chief of Staff who is ill to transfer to Negros and maintained a liaison with USFIP and Mindanao Force.\nSupplies in the warehouses of Army Transport Service was brought to the mountains, some issued to units and civilians to ensure nothing is left to the Japanese. This resulted to torture and brutal beatings of Colonel Cook upon knowing is left and leaving the Japanese ship sent to Cebu to get all the supplies ended empty handed.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAfter Visayan Force headquarters unable to maintained contact outside Cebu having been isolated in Cebu Sierra Madre Mountains, General Wainwright upon realization that Cebu is lost, receiving Colonel Hilsman's report that Cebu combat operation has cease ordered General Sharp of Mindanao Force to reconstitute his old command the Visayas-Mindanao Force to command the other island garrisons that still exists.\nKawaguchi Detachment was able to defeat the Cebu Brigade and in control of the island including Cebu ports and Lahug field which is vital for their next conquest of the Japanese, the Mindanao Island.\nPhilippine Commonwealth Supreme Court Chief Justice Jose Abad Santos was captured in Barili, Cebu and was brought to Malabang, Lanao and was executed in May 1942.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== See also ===\nVisayan Force\n81st Infantry Division\n82nd Infantry Regiment\nKawaguchi Detachment\n\n\n=== External links ===\nThere were others, Unpublished papers of Colonel Hiram Tarkington, CO 61st Field Artillery\nTabunan, Colonel Manuel F.

She was elected to serve on the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IAHCR) from January 2024 through to the end of 2027 and to be the OAS's Rapporteur on Human Mobility.\n\n\n== Life ==\nPochak qualified as a lawyer and took a strong interest in human rights. She was the General Director of Human Rights in the Public Prosecutor's Office.\nIn 2022, she was working for the Secretary of Human Rights of Argentina as a \"Subsecretary of Protection and International Relations on Human Rights\". \nArgentina proposed that she should be a candidate to be elected to be one of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR)'s commissioners. As part of the process, an independent panel led by Claudia Martin of the American University Washington College of Law looked at all of the prospective candidates to be one of the four new IACHR members. The panel was concerned that four candidates were withdrawn, however, Pochak was considered to be acceptable as a candidate after they investigated her human rights standards and her \"independence, impartiality, and absence of conflicts\".\n\nIn 2024 new IACHR commissioners were elected, including Gloria de Mees and Pochak, to replace long-serving commissioners: the Jamaican Margarette May Macaulay, Julissa Mantilla Falcón and the Panamanian Esmeralda Arosemena de Troitiño. The initial President of the  Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) was Roberta Clarke.\nPochak took over the role of Rapporteur on Human Mobility from a previous commissioner José Luis Caballero Ochoa. The job is to look at human mobility and report to the OAS.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Ankokuji Burial Jar Cluster (安国寺甕棺墓群, Ankokuji kamekan bogun)  is a Yayoi period cemetery, located in the Yamakawajindai  neighborhood of the city of Kurume, Fukuoka Prefecture Japan. It was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1972.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Ankokuji Burial Jar Cluster is located on the south bank of the Chikugo River, approximately 2 kilometers north of Mount Kora, in an area where the Chikugo River, which flows through the Chikugo Plain, passes the foot of Mt. Kora and changes its flow from west to south. The necropolis was discovered in 1978 during an urban planning project. The site is spread out in an almost oval shape, measuring approximately 60 meters from east-to-west and 90 meters from north-to-south. The remains found in the archaeological excavation area include 111 jar burial graves, 4 earthen pit graves, 4 pits, and 17 ritual sites. Other than the two stone-covered jar tombs from the middle of the Yayoi period, all of the jar tombs are double-sided jar coffins.The ritual remains are an earthen pit containing a large amount of red-painted Yayoi pottery was discarded. Since no burial goods were found in the tombs, no difference in social status could be recognized. It is estimated that there are probably around 300 graves in total in this site, which is important for understanding the tomb system of the Yayoi period. The excavated items are on display at the Kurume City Cultural Properties Museum. The site is approximately 15 minutes by car from Nishitetsu Kurume Station on the Nishitetsu Tenjin Ōmuta Line. \nThe site is located within the grounds of the Rinzai school temple of Ankoku-ji, one of the 60 Ankoku-ji temples which were constructed in all provinces across Japan, in the 14th century by Ashikaga Takauji. \n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFukuoka Tourism Web(in Japanese)",

        "content": "The Yame Kofun cluster (八女古墳群, Yame Kofun-gun) is a group of kofun burial mounds located in the Yame hills, across the towns of Yame, Hirokawa, Chikugo, Fukuoka, Japan. The Noriba Kofun was designated a National Historic Site in 1922, followed by the Iwatoyama, Ishijinyama, Zenzōzuka, and Kōgadani Kofun on an individual basis. These five separate National Historic Sites were merged into a single site in 1978, and the Maruyamazuka, Maruyama, and Chausuzuka Kofun were added to the protected area.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Yame Kofun cluster consists of approximately 300 kofun built between the 4th and 7th centuries in Yame Hills. These are thought to be the tombs of the clan of Iwai, the ruler of Tsukushi, who were a powerful local in northern Kyushu mentioned in the Kojiki, Nihon Shoki and other ancient sources. In 527 AD, they were leaders of the Iwai Rebellion, to overthrow Yamato control.\n\nNoriba Kofun\nThe Noriba Kofun is a two-tiered zenpō-kōen-fun (前方後円墳), which is shaped like a keyhole, having one square end and one circular end, when viewed from above, located approximately 300 meters east of Iwatoyama Kofun. It has a length of approximately 70 meters; the diameter of the rear circular portion is approximately 30 meters, the height is approximately five meters, and the width of the front portion is approximately 35 meters. According to Edo period accounts, the tumulus once had stone statues of warriors, but these have since disappeared; the surrounding moat and embankment are also missing. The burial facility is a horizontal passage with a multi-chamber structure. It is a decorated kofun. The back and side walls, which are made of large stones, and the stones on both sleeves of the burial chamber are decorated with continuous triangular patterns, concentric circles, and bracken hand patterns in red, yellow, and blue. The burial chamber is not open to the public for preservation reasons. It was opened in the early twentieth century and grave goods such as jade, horse harnesses, and Sue ware were discovered. These artifacts are now in the Tokyo National Museum, and a gilt-bronze-covered ring-headed iron sword pommel is in the Fukuoka Prefectural Fukushima High School. The tumulus is estimated to have been constructed in the mid-6th century based on the grave goods, decorative patterns, and burial chamber structure.\nAccording to legend, as it is located next to the Iwatoyama Kofun, it is said to be the tomb of Kuzuko, a son of Iwai, the Prince of Tsukushi.\n\nIwatoyama Kofun\nThe Iwatoyama Kofun is a two-stage keyhole-shaped tumulus orientated to the west, with a 43-meter square projection on its northeast corner. The tumulus has a length of 135 meters, with a posterior circular diameter of 60 meters and a height of 18 meters, and an anterior rectangular width of 92 meters and a height of 17 meters. It is surrounded by a 20-meter-wide moat and embankment. It was built in the first half of the 6th century, based on the chronology of the Sue ware pottery, and this also matches the records in the \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihonshoki\" (as well as the of Chikugo no Kuni Fudoki) as the location of the grave of Iwai, the \"Prince of Tsukushi\" who led the Iwai Rebellion against the Yamato state. The main body of the tumulus has not been excavated, but  electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) has confirmed a structure that is presumed to be a side-pit type stone burial chamber.  The Iwatoyama Kofun is especially noted for its more than 100 stone statues, which have been unearthed from the mound and surrounding embankment, which depict near life-sized people, animals, and objects. This is unique in terms of both the number and variety of stone images. Two of the stone warriors are National Important Cultural Properties and are at the Tokyo National Museum, and two more; along with 60 other stone images (all also Important Cultural Properties) are at the Iwatoyama History and Culture Center on site.\n\nSekijinsan Kofun\nThe Sekijinsan Kofun is a keyhole-shaped tumulus that was held in legend to be the grave of Prince Iwai's father.  The tumulus has a length of 107 meters, with a posterior circular diameter of 53 meters and height of 12 meters, and an anterior rectangular width of 63 meters and a height of 11 meters. It was constructed in two stages in the front and three stages in the rear., and parts of a surrounding moat and embankment survive on the west side of the anterior part and the east side of the posterior part. Based on the shape of the tomb and the age of the Sue ware pottery that was excavated, it is thought to have been built in the early to mid-5th century, and is thus the oldest in the cluster.  In the center of the posterior circle is a horizontal-entry cave-style stone burial chamber made of flat masonry of chlorite schist, and a house-shaped sarcophagus. The lid is a hipped structure with a base length of 2.8 meters, and a rope hanging protrusion on the gable side. The body is made up of four stone slabs, and is 1.4 meters high and 2.3 meters long. The lid of the sarcophagus is embossed with a straight arc pattern and a double circle pattern, and is also painted red, which is important as the oldest known decorated tomb. The burial chamber was opened in the Edo period and any grave goods, as well as the ceiling have been lost. It is covered by a protective facility and can be viewed. The tumulus is also known for its stone warrior statue (Important Cultural Property) which is now enshrined with his back to the burial chamber. This stone statue is mentioned in Edo Period records, and is made of volcanic tuff from Mount Aso. It stands 1.8 meters tall, and is wearing triangular plate armor and is holding a sword. The face is eroded, as per local folklore, if people who had pain in their limbs, hips, shoulders, etc., rubbed or struck a spot on the statue corresponding to their sore area, it would be cured. This kofun should not be confused with the Sekijinsan Kofun (石神山古墳) in the city of Miyako, Fukuoka, which has the same name, but written in different kanji.\n\nKōgadani Kofun\nThe Kōgadani Kofun is a two-tiered circular enpun (円墳)-style tumulus measuring approximately 39 meters in diameter and 7 meters in height. The outer diameter, including the surrounding moat and embankment, reaches approximately 55 meters, making it the largest in the region. It was discovered by chance during the construction of an orchard in 1970. The burial facility is a horizontal-entry stone passage made of broken schist stones with a stone house-shaped burial chamber. The back and side walls are decorated with circles, concentric circles, triangular patterns, \"bipedal-ring\" patterns, and eyelids in red and green. One-third of the burial chamber was destroyed when the tomb was discovered, but it was later restored, a preservation facility was built, and the murals were protected. The bipedal-ring pattern is very rare, and there are only three other confirmed cases of this pattern, all of which are found in this region. In addition, the design of the chamber suggests a strong connection with the Higo region.  The tumulus is estimated to have been constructed in the mid-6th century, slightly earlier than the Maruyamazuka Kofun. Currently, it is maintained as a park along with the adjacent Sekijinyama Kofun. The burial chamber is open to the public twice a year, in spring and autumn, and a replica of the burial chamber is on display at Kofunpia Hirokawa.\n\nZenzōzuka Kofun\nThe Zenzōzuka Kofun is a keyhole-shaped tumulus and the third largest in the cluster after Iwatoyama Kofun and Sekijinyama Kofun. The front part faces west, and the tomb is built in two stages and surrounded by fukiishi and haniwa. Judging from the style of the cylindrical haniwa, it appears to have been built in the early to mid-6th century.\n\nMaruyamazuka Kofun\nThe Maruyamazuka Kofun is a large round tumulus measuring approximately 33 meters in diameter and 5.3 meters in height, and it is thought that originally there was a moat and embankment surrounding the mound. It is located 200 meters to the south of the Zenzōzuka Kofun and Chausuzuka Kofun. The burial facility is a double-sleeved, horizontal stone burial chamber measuring eight meters in total length and opening to the south. Like the Noriba Kofun, it has a multi-chambered structure with a front chamber and a back chamber, using large stones for the lower back and flat stones at the top, stacked in a dome shape. Additionally, the back walls, burial chambers, and front chamber sleeve stones are decorated with triangular patterns, circular patterns, and warabi patterns in red, yellow, and green. The burial chamber was backfilled after excavation for preservation purposes, and it is currently impossible to enter. The Maruyamazuka Kofun is thought to have been constructed around the latter half of the 6th century.\n\nChausuzuka Kofun\nThe Chausuzuka Tumulus is a circular kofun, measuring 24 meters in diameter and 5.3 meters in height. Judging from the appearance of the surrounding area, there is a possibility that a surrounding moat or embankment existed, but it is not clear. Due to grave robbery, the center of the mound has collapsed, but it is believed to have had a side-pit-type stone burial chamber. Although no excavations have been conducted, it appears that this tumulus was built around the latter half of the 6th century, based on the Sue ware and cylindrical haniwa found at the site.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\nDecorated kofun\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Iwatoyama-kofun at Wikimedia Commons\n Media related to ISekijinsan Kofun at Wikimedia Commons\n\nYame city home page(in Japanese)\nCultural Properties in Fukuoka Prefecture(in Japanese)",

His first training session with the senior team of Cape Town Spurs came when he was 15, and he was moved up to the senior team in 2021. Here, he played two seasons in the National First Division, gaining promotion to the 2023–24 South African Premier Division.\nIn 2022, Bern went on trial with KV Mechelen in Belgium. He also helped launch a charity campaign called \"Blikkies and Boots\", aimed at donating sports gear and nutritional goods for the club Blikkiesdorp United FC.\nDuring the 2023–24 Premier Division, Bern was moved from left back to defensive midfield. The manager Ernst Middendorp who took over during the season wanted Bern more centrally in the field.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Basilica of Saint-Julian of Brioude is a basilica of the Auvergne Romanesque style located in the territory of the French commune of Brioude, in the department of Haute-Loire in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region. It is classified as a historical monument.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe Basilica of Saint-Julian is located in the southern margin of the former Diocese of Clermont, in the municipality of Brioude, in the French department of Haute-Loire.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first sanctuary dedicated to Saint Julian dates back to the late 4th century. It was built on the presumed tomb of the saint by a Spanish lady, as a token of gratitude for the fulfillment of her vow. Gregory of Tours reports that the saint's fame spread, attracting pilgrims. A first church was then built. The Duke Victorius, the Visigothic governor of Auvergne, adorned it with marble columns from ancient monuments; the remains of fluted columns found today in the crypt may be part of them. A clergy was established to celebrate worship and welcome the faithful: Gregory of Tours mentions in his writings the existence of a monastery and monks.\nThe construction of the Romanesque church dates back to the first quarter of the 12th century. It was favored by the development of the town of Brioude, which became a place of pilgrimage and a stop on the routes to Santiago de Compostela, Rome, and Jerusalem. A militia was allegedly established to guard the saint's tomb, later replaced by a college of canons.\nThe chapter then sought to break free from the control of the Counts of Auvergne. Pope Urban II, who came to preach the First Crusade in Clermont in 1095, placed Saint-Julian under his direct authority. His successor, Paschal II, confirmed the chapter's right to appoint its abbot and provost. King Louis VII also asserted that the chapter depended on him. Dissensions arose within the chapter itself, reflecting the rivalry between the families of Mercœur and Auvergne. In 1223, after the incorporation of Auvergne into the royal domain, the chapter bought back from the Counts of Auvergne their feudal rights over Brioude. The chapter of Saint-Julian maintained its control over Brioude until the Revolution, which led to its dissolution. The church, reassigned for parish use in 1794, saw one of its bell towers demolished and the other decapitated.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Prague Speedway has consisted of several former motorcycle speedway teams and stadia and the current team known as AK Markéta Praha, who race at the Markéta Stadium.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1928 to 1992 ===\nThe origins of speedway in Prague can be traced back to races held at the Stadion Letná, starting on 9 June 1928 and these were soon followed by meetings at the Great Strahov Stadium on 14 May 1933 and the Žižkov TJ Sokol Stadium on 11 April 1934.\nFollowing the end of World War II, the Czechoslovak military began forming sports teams and regional and national competitions. In 1953, a law (following the Soviet model) determined that all clubs should be voluntary sports societies, with athletes being allocated to clubs according to their civic occupations. The first Czechoslovak Team Speedway Championship was held in 1956 and featured two teams from Prague, Rudá Hvězda Praha (Red Star Prague), associated with the Czechoslovak police force and KAMK Prague, who were based at the ČAFC stadium in Spořilov. The two teams finished first and second respectively in the inaugural league season. Red Star then dominated the league during the period 1957 to 1962, when many teams carried the Svazarm prefix to their club names.\n\nDespite the league competition ending in 1963, the Czechoslovak Individual Championship continued and Red Star rider Luboš Tomíček Sr. was the county's leading rider, winning five consecutive titles. Additionally the first World Championship event held in Prague was a continental qualifying round during the 1963 Individual Speedway World Championship, held at the Great Strahov Stadium on 9 May.\nIn 1965 and 1966, the FK Viktoria Stadion held speedway, used by the Victoria Speedway Club Praha (VSC). VSC was the new name for the Prague team that raced primarily at Spořilov again from 1967 and included riders such as Antonín Kasper Sr., František Ledecký, Václav Verner and Bohumír Bartoněk. When the league restarted in 1967, VSC emerged as the new champions but the Red Star team began to dominate again the following season and VSC were homeless by 1970.\nIn 1971, VSC found a new home at Letňa Avia in Čakovice and were called Zizkov Prague before taking the name AMK Čakovice in the late 1970s. The venue also hosted a final round of the Czechoslovak Individual Championship eight times from 1973 to 1983. Meanwhile, the city's Red Star team based at the Markéta Stadium continued to dominate all competition and continually won the league title. It was not until the fall of Real socialism in the Eastern Bloc countries, that clubs began to choose names of their own, Red Star became Olymp Praha and then much later AK Markéta Praha. \n\n\n=== After Dissolution ===\n\nFollowing the Dissolution of Czechoslovakia the Czech Republic Team Championship began in 1992. AMK Čakovice competed during 1992 and 1993 but then folded and the Letňa Avia became solely a football ground. \nThe demise of the Čakovice club left the Markéta Stadium as the sole remaining speedway venue in Prague. The Great Strahov Stadium had last hosted speedway on 2 September 1973, the ČAFC stadium in Spořilov had been demolished to make way for a road and the Stadion Letná and FK Viktoria Stadion had long since removed their speedway tracks.  \nAs the only Prague club, AK Markéta Praha continue to compete strongly in the Czech Republic Extraliga, winning the league in 2022. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Cristina Sampaio (born 1960) is a Portuguese children's book illustrator and newspaper, magazine and animated cartoonist who has won many awards for her work.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nSampaio was born in the Portuguese capital of Lisbon in 1960. She studied at the Lisbon School of Fine Arts, graduating in painting. She continues to live in Lisbon.\n\n\n== Career ==\nShe began working as an illustrator and cartoonist for magazines and newspapers in 1986, and in 1987 did the first of over 20 illustrations of children's books. The newspapers she has worked for have included Público, O Independente and Expresso in Portugal, as well as international papers such as the The New York Times and The Boston Globe in the US, Kleine Zeitung and Die Presse in Austria and Alternatives économiques and Courrier International in France. In 1998, she created the set design for the children's musical Bom Dia, Benjamim!, a theatrical presentation performed at the Belém Cultural Centre near Lisbon, based on a successful television series. She is a member of Cartooning for Peace. Sampaio has produced multimedia presentations for Ciência Viva and others and, more recently, has worked with the Spam Cartoon collective to produce animated shorts for SIC Notícias and RTP3. \n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\nSampaio has received many awards for her work including the Society for News Design Award of Excellence in 2002, 2005 and 2009, the Prémio Stuart Award for Cartoons (2006 and 2010), a First Prize for an editorial cartoon from the World Press Cartoon (2007), where she also received two honourable mentions in 2009 and 2015, and the Society for News Design of Pamplona Silver Medal 2009. In 2009, the Amadora Comic Strip Festival awarded her the prize for best children's illustration for the book Canta o Galo Gordo (The Fat Rooster sings). In 2023 she was one of 16 finalists for the European Cartoon Award.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nIn 2023 an animated cartoon by Sampaio was broadcast on RTP3. It showed a police officer training in a shooting range, shooting with increasing intensity the darker the colour of his target became. The intention of the cartoon, inspired by events in France when a young Frenchman was killed by the police, leading to civil disturbances, was to criticise the racism of the security forces. She was condemned by both the left and right of the Portuguese political spectrum and received \"dozens of threats and hate messages\". Both she and the broadcaster were the subject of criminal complaints by the Portuguese police, even though they stressed that the target of the cartoon was the French police, not the Portuguese.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nSampaio's work has been presented in numerous group and solo exhibitions, in Portugal and elsewhere. They include: \n\nCombat Illustrations 88/89, The Commune (1989)\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, Centro Cultural da Malaposta, Lisbon (1996)\n25 Comics commemorating the 25th of April, Cordoaria Nacional, Belém, Lisbon (1999)\n500 years of Brazil, Casino Estoril and Museu da Imagem e do Som do Rio de Janeiro (2000)\nThe Drawing of the Day, a decade of illustrations in Público, at Bedeteca de Lisboa (2001).\nNa Ponta da Linha, Cartoon Xira (2003).\nThings that happen, Cordoaria Nacional (2004)\nWorld Press Cartoon – Prix 2005-2008, Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Paris (2008)\nCartoons from the 27 Countries of the EU, Zappeion Megaron, Athens (2008)\nCartoon Xira, Vila Franca de Xira (2009 and 2010)\nExpressions – International Cartoon Exhibition, Global Forum on Freedom of Expression, Drøbak, Norway (2009)\nDessine-moi la Paix en Méditerranée, Marseille (2009)\nOne Century, Ten Pencils, One Hundred Drawings, Museum of the Presidency of the Republic, Lisbon (2009)\nTaches d’Opinion, Mémorial Cité de l’Histoire, Caen (2010)\nRes Publica, Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Lisbon (2010)\nExhibitions - Cristina Sampaio (Portugal).

        "content": "The 2024 Bolivarian Youth Games (Spanish: Juegos Bolivarianos de la Juventud 2024), officially known as the I Bolivarian Youth Games \"Sucre 2024\" and simply known as Sucre 2024, will be the first edition of the Bolivarian Youth Games, a regional multi-sport event for athletes of up to 19 years old, organized by the Organización Deportiva Bolivariana (ODEBO). Originally scheduled to be held in Sucre, Bolivia from 17 April to 1 May 2020, the inaugural edition of the Bolivarian Youth Games underwent several postponements until it was definitively scheduled to be held from 4 to 14 April 2024.\n\n\n== Host city and date changes ==\nODEBO launched the Bolivarian Youth Games for the first time in 2010 with Lima, Peru to be the host city of the first edition in 2015. In February 2015, the event was postponed in order to establish the age limit for athletes as well as the sports program and a new date for the Games. In July 2015, during its Extraordinary General Assembly, ODEBO moved the Games to 2016, keeping Lima as host city.\nIn January 2016, ODEBO approved the age range for athletes following the same criteria as the International Olympic Committee for the Youth Olympic Games, and the Games were moved to 2019. In 2017, the Games were again rescheduled, this time for 2020, and Peru resigned to host the Games, giving way to Sucre, Bolivia being named as the new host city on 10 November 2017.\nEarly 2019, the Games were scheduled to be held between 17 April and 1 May 2020, but were then rescheduled for 17–30 October 2020 due to the 2019 Bolivian protests, and later for 5–18 December 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2020, ODEBO decided to reschedule the games from 24 April to 7 May 2021 and in December 2020 it rescheduled the event again, this time from 27 November to 9 December 2021 at the request of the Organizing Committee due to the health emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic prevailing at that time.\nIn October 2021, the Games were postponed to 2022 due to lack of funding and to avoid a clash with the 2021 Junior Pan American Games (25 November–5 December). In April 2022, ODEBO and Bolivian authorities reactivate the organization of the event, setting April 2023 as the new date for the Games. In August 2022, ODEBO's President Baltazar Medina confirmed the First Bolivarian Youth Games in Sucre from 30 November–9 December 2023 as new tentative dates, which were confirmed in January 2023. Finally, in April 2023, the Games were rescheduled for the last time to take place between 5 and 14 April 2024 in order to allow more time for the organization and to coincide with Sucre's bicentennial commemorative activities.\n\n\n== Venues ==\nThese are the venues confirmed to host the games:\n\nColiseo Municipal Max Toledo – Badminton.\nColiseo Jorge Revilla Aldana – 3x3 basketball, Table tennis and Volleyball.\nColiseo Universitario N° 1 – Boxing and Taekwondo.\nComplejo de Raquetas Conrrado Moscoso – Basque pelota and Squash.\nComplejo de Tenis La Madona – Tennis\nComplejo Deportivo Garcilazo – Archery, Baseball5, Beach volleyball, Futsal, Handball and Cycling BMX racing.\nCircuito Bolivariano El Rollo – Triathlon (cycling and running).\nEstadio Olímpico Patria – Athletics, Karate, Racquetball, Weightlifting and Wrestling.\nPiscina Bolivariana El Rollo – Swimming and Triathlon (swimming).\nPoligimnasio Max Toledo – Artistic gymnastics, Fencing and Judo.\nSucre-Potosi route – Road cycling\nCerro Churuquella – Mountain biking.\n\n\n== The Games ==\n\n\n=== Participating National Olympic Committees ===\nAll 7 ODEBO's National Olympic Committees (NOCs) will participate in these games. Each NOC was able to enter a maximum of 200 athletes, with the exception of the host, which was entitled to enter up to 300 athletes. Numbers in brackets denote the number of athletes being sent to the Games.\n\n Bolivia (238)\n Chile (184)\n Colombia (162)\n Ecuador (101)\n Panama (69)\n Peru (185)\n Team ODEBO (1)\n Venezuela (197)\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe original 2020 games program proposed 25 sports in 31 disciplines. The final 2024 program feature 24 sports in 27 disciplines with the following changes regarding the original program: Football and Softball were replaced by Futsal and Baseball5 while Shooting was removed from the program.\nNumbers in parentheses indicate the number of medal events to be contested in each sport/discipline.\n\n\n=== Schedule ===\nThe competition schedule is as follows:\n\n\n== Medal table ==\n  *   Host nation (Bolivia)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in Spanish)\nI Bolivarian Youth Games – 2020 Technical Information",

Her father Professor Urbano Egidio da Silva Costa Gondim de Albuquerque guided her early education. She moved to Natal to become a teacher. She championed female education throughout her career and wrote a popular book called Reflexões às minhas alunas that went through many reprints. She had conservative views, however, and held realist novels (such as O Cortiço by Aluísio Azevedo or O Ateneu by Raul de Pompeia) to be unsuitable for young minds.\nShe retired in 1891 at age 52. She then began to dedicate herself more seriously to literature and history, writing books such as O Brasil - poema histórico do país and Sedição de 1817 na Capitania ora Estado do Rio Grande do Norte. She continued to publish poetry and works on regional and national history, until her death in 1933. One of her last books was a volume of poems called A Lira Singela.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 1995 Queensland local elections were held on 11 March 1995 to elect the councils of three of the local government areas (LGAs) of Queensland, Australia.\nThe elections were held following several amalgamations which saw the abolishment of the Shire of Albert, Shire of Moreton and Shire of Mulgrave. Elections for these LGAs (and the LGAs they merged into) had been held only a year earlier in 1994.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn 19 March 1992, the Electoral and Administrative Review Commission, created two years earlier, produced its report External Boundaries of Local Authorities, and recommended a number of changes to local government boundaries and the amalgamation of some local governments.\n\n\n=== Albert ===\n\nAlbert, created in 1948, had seen a rapid expansion from the late 1960s onwards. However, the Shire of Logan was separately incorporated in 1978, and Albert lost 110.0 km2 (42.5 sq mi) of its area and 54,650 people in the change − almost three-quarters of its population. With the astronomic growth levels experienced by the Gold Coast area from the late 1970s onwards, the new Albert grew from 18,753 at the 1976 census to 143,697 in 1991.\nAlthough the commission's recommendations only included boundary adjustments between Albert and the City of Gold Coast, the outcome following much public debate was a decision by the Queensland Government to absorb Albert into Gold Coast City.\n\n\n=== Moreton ===\nMoreton was created in 1917 and represented an area surrounding, but not including, Ipswich. In 1988, the shire had a population of about 38,000 people and covered an area of 1813 square kilometres.\nIt merged into the City of Ipswich, although some of its boundaries fell under the City of Brisbane and the Shire of Esk.\n\n\n=== Mulgrave ===\nMulgrave, formed in 1879, surrounded the City of Cairns in the Far North, and was administered from Cairns. It covered an area of 1,718.3 square kilometres (663.4 sq mi), and by the time of the 1991 census, 88% of it population resided within Cairns's metropolitan area.\nThe Commission recommended that the shire be merged into Cairns City, which happened when the Local Government (Cairns, Douglas, Mareeba and Mulgrave) Regulation 1994 was gazetted on 16 December 1994.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Lin Min Chen (Chinese: 林明禎; born 1 June 1990) is a Malaysian actress active in Malay, Taiwanese, and Hong Kong cinema. Debuting as a singer in Taiwan, Lin embarked on her acting career with the 2016 Taiwanese romance series Love Me and Prince of Wolf. She gained recognition in Hong Kong with her role as Summer/Winter in the 2017 horror romance film Vampire Cleanup Department and has since appeared in various Hong Kong productions, including The Fatal Raid, A Journey of Happiness (both 2019), and One Second Champion (2021). In 2022, Lin delivered a breakout performance as Meow in the comedy film Table for Six, earning a nomination for Best Supporting Actress in the 41st Hong Kong Film Awards. She reprised the role in the sequel Table for Six 2 in 2024.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLin was born on June 1, 1990, in Penang, Malaysia. She was of Chinese descent with ancestral roots from Chaozhou, Guangdong. Her mother was a lounge bar singer, and she had an elder sister and two younger brothers. When she was six years old, her family moved to Johor Bahru. After graduating from high school, Lin ran a beauty salon with her sister to raise money for her brothers' school fees. In her childhood, she never intended to join the entertainment industry; instead, she aspired to become a chef. She had plans to study culinary arts in Australia after saving enough money from the salon business.\nIn 2014, Lin gained popularity on the internet when a customer took a photo of her at the beauty salon. Several artist agencies, including singer Yu Heng's recently established studio, approached her. Yu Heng invited Lin to Taiwan to record a demo after recognizing her potential. In 2015, Lin signed with Seed Music as a singer and moved to Taipei to begin her career. She released her first single, \"My Happy Adventure\" in 2016, and subsequently starred in lead roles in the romance web series Love Me and Prince of Wolf. During the same year, the production crew of a horror romance film called Vampire Cleanup Department, directed by Chiu Sin Hang, went to Taiwan to audition for a suitable lead actress. Lin's agency recommended her for the audition, and she won the role of Summer/Winter, a vampire who died in the nineteenth century. Her performance in the film garnered public recognition in Hong Kong and marked the beginning of her career there. Lin filmed an advertisement for a fintech company in 2017, and released her second EP, #Me, in both Taiwan and Hong Kong. In 2019, she starred in the comedy action thriller film The Fatal Raid and the Hong Kong-Malaysian comedy film A Journey of Happiness, playing lead roles. She also released her third EP Whoo in the same year. In 2021, Lin appeared in Chiu Sin Hang's sports film One Second Champion as Yiu, a yoga teacher at a struggling boxing gym, and landed a recurring role in the Singaporean horror mystery thriller series The Ferryman·Legends of Nanyang.\nIn 2022, Lin achieved a breakthrough role in the Hong Kong comedy film Table for Six. She portrayed Meow, a Taiwanese media personality who moves to Hong Kong and stays with a family starring Dayo Wong, Stephy Tang, Louis Cheung, Ivana Wong, and Peter Chan. Her performance, along with her iconic media personality greeting posture in the film, garnered significant popularity on the internet, and she received a nomination for Best Supporting Actress at the 41st Hong Kong Film Awards. Lin reprised her role in the sequel Table for Six 2 in 2024, and her performance, particularly a crying monologue scene, received positive acclaim. She was also named the Youth Ambassador in the 16th Asian Film Awards.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nLin Min Chen at IMDb",

Over the years, G-Drive ran in conjunction with multiple race teams, including Jota Sport, TDS Racing, Graff Racing, and Algarve Pro Racing.\nAs a result of regulations imposed by the FIA on Russian competitors in the aftermath of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, G-Drive withdrew from international competition.

        "content": "Esther Lipsen Coopersmith (January 18, 1930 – March 26, 2024) was an American diplomat, philanthropist, political lobbyist, and a champion for women's equality. For over 70 years, she organized gatherings, from small dinners to grand formal ones, across the world. Her client list varied from politicians and visiting royals to academics and actors. In 2009, UNESCO named her a goodwill ambassador for \"fostering intercultural dialogue\".\n\n\n== Early years ==\nEsther Lipsen was born on January 18, 1930, in Des Moines, Iowa; her father was an emigrant cattle dealer from present-day Moldova and her mother was a homemaker from Romania. They moved to Mazomanie, Wisconsin, and Lipsen became interested in politics at age 8, after listening to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's fireside chats on the radio. After graduating from high school, she studied at the University of Denver and later at the University of Wisconsin, where she joined the Young Democrats of America. She became actively involved in politics in 1952, when she filled in to chair an event for the presidential Democratic hopeful, Tennessee senator Estes Kefauver, who went on to win the Wisconsin primary election and 11 of the 15 others across the country, even defeating sitting President Harry S. Truman, who then withdrew his re-election campaign. Kefauver asked Lipsen to open and manage a campaign office for the Chicago convention. Not having any experience with such a job, she asked a rival politician's aides for advice. Despite Kefauver's popularity and campaign success, he lost the Democratic nomination to Illinois governor Adlai Stevenson II. Lipsen then organized Young Democrat campaign clubs to support Stevenson. Although Kefauver invited her to Washington, D.C., in 1954, he did not hire her, despite his desire to run in future presidential elections.\n\n\n== Wife, diplomat, and ambassador ==\nWhile in Washington, D.C., Lipsen met real estate developer Jack Coopersmith. They married in 1954 and had four children within 8 years. In 1964, Jack remained in Washington, while Esther traveled the country for President Lyndon B. Johnson's family, hosting barbecues for his two daughters. She also served as one of Johnson's White House staff.\nIn 1972, she supported Joe Biden when he ran in the United States Senate election. She even hosted a fundraiser for him at her home in 2023. During the 1978 Camp David Accords with President Jimmy Carter, Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, Coopersmith hosted a party for the news media. One year later, Carter appointed her as a representative of the U.S. for the United Nations (UN), her first paying job since the 1950s. In 1984, the UN awarded her its Peace Medal, making her only the second woman at the time to receive the honor. In 1991, she accompanied then-governor Bill Clinton to Moscow to improve his knowledge of foreign policy for his plans to run for the U.S. presidency.\nIn 2009, UNESCO named Coopersmith a Goodwill Ambassador \"in light of her outstanding contribution to strengthening mutual understanding between peoples and her unfailing commitment to fostering intercultural dialogue.\"\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nFollowing her husband Jack's death in 1991, Coopersmith sold their home in Potomac, Maryland, and bought and renovated a house in Kalorama Heights in D.C. She rarely ventured from it, however that didn't affect her desire to be diplomatic. She turned it into a museum of sorts, displaying all the memorabilia she collected over the years, and hosted dignitaries for between 50 and 75 events in it. Her last trip abroad was in 2023 to celebrate the U.S. re-entering UNESCO.\nCoopersmith died from cancer at her home on March 26, 2024, at the age of 94.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nProfile at UNA-CNA\nStatement from President Biden on the Passing of Esther Coopersmith\nCoopersmith's 90 birthday celebration on YouTube",

        "content": "Mackinlaya confusa is a plant in the carrot, fennel and parsley family Apiaceae that is endemic to Queensland, Australia. It was first described in 1909.\n\n\n== Description ==\nMackinlaya confusa is a shrub growing up to 6 m (20 ft) tall, usually unbranched. The compound leaves are held on petioles up to 25 cm (10 in) long,  with 5–7 leaflets arranged around a common attachment point (i.e. they are palmate). The leaflets are glabrous (without hairs), measure up to 21 cm (8 in) long and 10 cm (3.9 in) wide, and their margins may be smooth, toothed or lobed.\nThe inflorescence is terminal and takes the form of an umbel of umbels of umbels - that is, a number of stalks of equal length emanate from a single point on the plant, which in turn branch from a common point into more stalks, and these finally branch into a number of flower stalks (pedicels), again of common length and attachment point, and each carrying a single flower. Individual flowers are about 2.5 mm (0.10 in) diameter and may be white, cream or green.\nThe fruit when ripe is a glaucous 2-lobed drupe about 10 mm (0.39 in) long and 15 mm (0.59 in) wide, which may be blue, purple, black or reddish. The remnants of the style and calyx usually persist at the apex, and they contain 1 or 2 cream to pale brown seeds.\n\n\n=== Phenology ===\nFlowering occurs from January to June, fruit have been observed from July to January.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThis species was first formally published in 1909 by the English botanist William Botting Hemsley, in the journal Kew Bulletin of Miscellaneous Information (now known as Kew Bulletin).\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe genus Mackinlaya was erected by Mueller and named in honour of the Scottish-born Australian explorer John McKinlay (cited as \"J. MacKinlay\" by Mueller). The species epithet confusa is from the Latin confusus meaning confused, and is a reference to the complex branching (i.e. three times umbellate) of the inflorescence.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThis species is endemic to Queensland and is found from the top of Cape York Peninsula, southwards along the east coast to Hinchinbrook Island. It grows in and adjacent to various types of rainforest, at altitudes from sea level up to 1,000 m (3,300 ft).\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nThe fruit are eaten by cassowaries (Casuarius casuarius) and golden bowerbirds (Prionodura newtoniana).\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nThis species is listed by the Queensland Government's Department of Environment, Science and Innovation as least concern. As of 29 March 2024, it has not been assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nView a map of herbarium collections of this species at the Australasian Virtual Herbarium\nView observations of this species on iNaturalist\nView images of this species on Flickriver.com",

        "content": "Piotech (also known as Tuojing Technology; Chinese: 拓荆科技; pinyin: Tàjīng Kējì) is a partially state-owned publicly listed Chinese company that manufactures semiconductor chip production equipment.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn April 2010. Piotech was founded by a group of returning international technology veterans from the United States along with the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\nIn 2015, Piotech announced that it had received a 270 billion yuan investment from a group that included the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund and Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment. The China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund currently remains the largest shareholder of the company.\nAccording to Piotech's initial public offering (IPO) prospectus in 2021, it has three products lines which are developing equipment for plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD) and  sub-atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (SACVD). The company's products were used in 14 nm process and above. It had also carried out testing in 10 nm process and below. Its customers included SMIC, Hua Hong Semiconductor, Yangtze Memory Technologies and ChangXin Memory Technologies.\nOn 20 April 2022, Piotech completed its IPO becoming a listed company on the Shanghai Stock Exchange STAR Market.\nIn July 2022, Piotech shares surged 10% after news reported that the United States was pushing the Netherlands to ban ASML Holding from selling certain technology to China to manufacture chips.\nIt was speculated that the United States New Export Controls on Advanced Computing and Semiconductors to China that was effective 7 October 2022 would have an impact on Piotech. According to a filing in early 2022, six of the seven key research and development executives of Piotech were American citizens. Many of its top management including chairman and general manager were also Americans.\nIn March 2024, Piotech stated its plan to invest 1.1 billion yuan in a high-end semiconductor equipment industrialization base construction project.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSemiconductor industry in China\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Swainsona longipilosa is a small annual plant in the family pea and is endemic to a small area in the central west of Western Australia.  It has about 5 egg-shaped leaflets with the narrower end toward the base, and racemes of up to 3, reddish purple flowers.\n\n\n== Description ==\nSwainsona longipilosa is an annual plant that typically grows to a height of about 4 cm (1.6 in). Its stems are about 1 mm (0.039 in) wide, densely softly-hairy and ribbed. The leaves are about 20 mm (0.79 in) long with about 5 egg-shaped leaflets with the narrower end towards the base, the side leaflets 5–8 mm (0.20–0.31 in) long and 2–3 mm (0.079–0.118 in) wide with stipules up to 7 mm (0.28 in) long at the base of the petioles. The flowers are arranged in racemes up to 10–50 mm (0.39–1.97 in) long with up to 3 flowers on a peduncle less than 0.5 mm (0.020 in) wide, each flower about 8 mm (0.31 in) long on a pedicel less than 1 mm (0.039 in) long. The sepals are joined at the base, forming a tube about 1 mm (0.039 in) long, the sepal lobes about the three times the length of the tube. The petals are reddish-purple, the standard petal about 6–8 mm (0.24–0.31 in) long and about 7 mm (0.28 in) wide, the wings 5–6 mm (0.20–0.24 in) long, and the keel 8–9 mm (0.31–0.35 in) long and 3–4 mm (0.12–0.16 in) deep. Flowering has been observed in August and the fruit is oblong, about 15 mm (0.59 in) and 3 mm (0.12 in) wide.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nSwainsona longipilosa was first formally described in 1993 by Joy Thompson in the journal Telopea from a specimen collected in 1981. The specific epithet (longipilosa) means \"long hair\".\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThis species of swainsona is only known from two localities in Western Australia where it grows on a stony, exposed hilltop in Acacia woodland in the Carnarvon and Gascoyne bioregions.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nSwainsona longipilosa is listed as \"Priority One\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions, meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations where it is potentially at risk.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Acteon panamensis is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Acteonidae.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe length of the shell attains 7.04 mm, its diameter 4.5 mm.\n(Original description) The apex of the shell is badly eroded, but apparently blunt. The shell contains about four whorls, the body whorl much the largest. The spire is shorter than the aperture. The suture is strongly marked. The whorl in front of it is abrupt, but not channelled. The periostracum pale yellowish, nearly transparent and polished. The sculpture consists of (on the penultimate whorl four) sharp distant spiral, fine, microscopically punctate, incised lines. These increase on the body whorl to about fifteen, of which five or six on the base are closer, the remainder, on the sides of the whorl, are less crowded, subequidistant, and similar. The shell is obscurely parallel-sided, slightly rounded, with a rounded and slightly protracted base. The aperture is narrow and is rounded in front. The outer lip is sharp, simple, or minutely notched by the incised spiral lines. The body of the shell shows a slight wash of callus. The columella is straight, short and has a single obscure fold near the middle, which lags behind the aperture. There is no umbilical perforation. \n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThis marine species occurs off in the Gulf of Panama.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nKeen, A. M. (1971). Sea Shells of Tropical West America.

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The KhAD-KGB campaign in Pakistan was a joint campaign in which the Afghan KhAD’s foreign \"Tenth Directorate\" and the Soviet KGB targeted Pakistan using prostitution spy rings, terror attacks, hijackings, serial killings, assassinations and the dissemination of propaganda to dissuade Pakistan from supporting the Afghan Mujahideen.\n\n\n== Prostitution spy rings ==\nIn mid-1985 the Soviet Union and Kabul launched psychological warfare against Pakistan in an attempt to morally destabilize society. As part of this strategy, the KGB and KHAD deployed hundreds of young girls of Afghan, Central Asian, and Russian origin to corrupt Pakistani society. This influx initially targeted the major urban centers such as Islamabad, Lahore, Karachi, Faisalabad, Multan, and Quetta. These groups of prostitutes strategically selected affluent areas in these cities and operated within a well-organized structure. Many of these prostitutes had connections to KGB and KHAD agents, with high-ranking government officials and Pakistan army officers being their primary targets. This led to the emergence of a \"galemjum (prostitute) culture\" in Pakistani society, which attracted professionals, the local commercial class, and frustrated youth in various urban centers.\n\n\n== Terror attacks ==\nAccording to a report by the US Defense Department, approximately 90% of the estimated 777 acts of international terrorism committed worldwide in 1987 took place in Pakistan. By 1988, KGB and KhAD agents were able to penetrate deep inside Pakistan and carry out attacks on mujahideen sanctuaries and guerrilla bases. There was strong circumstantial evidence implicating Moscow-Kabul in the August 1988 assassination of Zia ul-Haq, as the Soviets perceived that Zia wanted to adversely affect the Geneva process.\nAfghanistan's KHAD was one of four secret service agencies accused of perpetrating terrorist bombings in multiple Pakistani cities including Islamabad, Lahore, Karachi, and Rawalpindi during the early 1980s resulting in hundreds of civilian casualties. By the late 1980s, the US State Department blamed WAD for the perpetration of terrorist bombings in Pakistani cities.\n\n\n== 1987 Karachi car bombing ==\n\nOn 14 July 1987 two vehicles drove into the Bohri Bazaar in  Karachi, Pakistan packed with RDX and parked. The first car bomb detonated at about 6:30 pm outside a hairdresser's shop on Syedna Burhanuddin Street near a bus stop destroying eight shops and a hotel. The second car bomb detonated 30 minutes later on Raja Ghazanfar Ali Road which is about 100 yards away from the first car bombing. The car bomb detonated outside a record shop, setting multiple buildings on fire and destroying more dozen cars. The fires from the second car bomb continued burning for four hours. The double car bombing killed 72 people and injured 250. The Pakistani government blamed the Afghan intelligence agency for the car bombing.\n\n\n== US Peshawar consulate bombing ==\nA car bombing occurred in 1987, targeting the US consulate in Peshawar which ended up killing over 30 people.\n\n\n== 1988 Ojhri Camp disaster ==\n\nOn 10 April 1988, the Ojhri Camp, which was used as an ammunition depot for the Afghan mujahideen during the Soviet-Afghan war, exploded. As a result, munitions and rockets expelled by the blast killed 93 people and wounded 1,010 others, although it’s believed the death toll was much higher. U.S. Defense Department officials believed that the explosion at Ojhri Camp was the work of the Soviet KGB and the Afghan KhAD state intelligence agency.\n\n\n== Aid to Al-Zulfikar ==\n\nPakistan International Airlines Flight 326 was a domestic scheduled passenger flight that was hijacked by al-Zulfikar terrorists with support of Afghanistan's KHAD, from 2 March to 14 March 1981. It was a routine flight scheduled from Karachi to Peshawar, but the hijackers diverted it to Kabul, Afghanistan, and then Damascus, where the hostage situation ended with the release of prisoners by the Pakistani government.\n\n\n== The Hathora murders of Karachi ==\nAround some time in 1985, Pakistani police in Karachi were becoming alarmed by an increased number of killings. While the murders took place in different areas of the city, an investigation found these murders to be done in the same manner; a single blow to the head with a hathora (the word for \"hammer\" in Urdu). Upon investigation of the victims and their backgrounds, it was found that they were all street urchins or beggars on the streets.\nNone of the victims of the Hathora group survived apart from one person, who described the murderers as men in \"white suits and black masks\" who drove a white Suzuki vehicle. Upon realization that these murders were being committed by a group. newspapers across the nation began to report the victim's story and referred to these men as \"the Hathora Group\" oweing to their method of using hammers to murder their victims. Police didn't know who these men were and what motives they had to do commit these murders. For a while, these cases of murders stopped and then finally resumed around some time in mid-1986. For nearly 2 years, the city of Karachi was terrorised by the horrors of such group, with civilians fearing they would enter their homes and be killed by the Hathora group.\nSome Pakistani newspapers alluded that the Hathora group was actually made up of members of the Soviet intelligence agency, the KGB, and KHAD, who were striking back due to the Pakistani government backing the Afghan mujahideen against the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. A sociologist, when asked about these killings, mentioned that the chaos that was occurring in Karachi was easily manipulated by groups for their own motives. The sociologist strongly believed that these killings were planned to spread more fear in the city, which could be the intention of KHAD and the motive behind the murders.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nIn response to these attacks, Pakistan intensified Operation Cyclone which eventually resulted in the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan. In 1989, Pakistan would commence “Operation Jalalabad”, widely known as the Battle of Jalalabad, resulting in a decisive Afghan government victory.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSoviet-Afghan war\nOperation Cyclone\nBadaber uprising\nAfghanistan-Pakistan skirmishes\nOperation Curtain\nBattle for Hill 3234\nBattle of Jaji\nSiege of Khost\nOjhri Camp disaster\nOperation Magistral\nFirst Battle of Zhawar\nSecond Battle of Zhawar\nPakistan Soviet air confrontations during the Soviet Afghan war\nRaids inside Soviet Union during Soviet Afghan War\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sevil Geydarovna Aliyeva (Russian: Севиль Гейдаровна Алиева, born 12 October 1955) is an Azerbaijani composer and the founder of Space TV. She is also the daughter to the former President of Azerbaijan Geydar Aliyev, as well as the elder sister to the incumbent president Ilkham Aliyev.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn in Baku in 1955 to Heydar Aliyev and Zarifa Aliyeva, Sevil started to learn music when she was 6 years old. In 1982, when Geydar was appointed First Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union, the whole family, including Sevil and his younger brother, Ilkham Aliyev, who was studying at Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) during that time, moved to Moscow.\nShe married Makhmud Mamed-Guliev, who has been serving as the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs since 1993. They have a daughter, who frequently made phone calls to Kremlin, where Geydar was working. One day, she was invited to Kremlin to have a tea with Geydar, and she went with Sevil. Despite this, Sevil later revealed that her daughter could go there without her.\n\n\n== Post-Soviet life ==\nFollowing the 1993 coup, Geydar came to power and became the new President of Azerbaijan. Sevil, who advocated freedom of people, was not in favour of her father's ruling style.\nIn 1998, Sevil left Azerbaijan and moved to London. Since then, she rarely visits Azerbaijan; one of them was in 2003, when Geydar passed away.\nFollowing the death of Geydar, his son and Sevil's younger brother, Ilkham, succeeded his presidency, although Sevil was not in favour of her brother. She once planned to encourage people to fight against her brother. She opposes Armenian–Azerbaijani wars, as she believes that her mother, Zarifa, has an Armenian blood.\nIn 2009, several newspapers reported that Sevil was trying to join politics, in opposition to her brother. She, however, denined the rumour.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSevil Aliyeva on Instagram",

        "content": "The 2024 Murmansk Oblast gubernatorial election will take place on 8 September 2024, on common election day. Incumbent Governor Andrey Chibis is running to a second term in office.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSecond-term Governor of Murmansk Oblast Marina Kovtun announced her resignation in March 2019, citing personal reasons. Initially Deputy Minister of Energy Aleksey Teksler was expected to be appointed acting Governor of Murmansk Oblast, however, two days prior to Kovtun's resignation Teksler was appointed acting Governor of Chelyabinsk Oblast. Then-Deputy Minister of Construction, Housing and Utilities and Federal Chief Housing Inspector Andrey Chibis was appointed as Kovtun's replacement.\nChibis ran for a full term nominated by United Russia and won the September 2019 election with 60.07% of the vote against five opponents, including Murmansk Oblast Duma members Maksim Belov (LDPR, 18.27%) and Mikhail Antropov (CPRF, 11.38%), former Apatity mayor. Despite the overwhelming margin of victory (nearly 42 points), it was the third closest gubernatorial election that cycle.\nOn April 4, 2024 Governor Chibis was attacked and stabbed by a lone assailant after a town hall meeting in Apatity. Chibis survived the attack and was rushed to a hospital in Murmansk for treatment of his injuries, while his deputy Nadezhda Aksenova served as acting Governor of Murmansk Oblast until Chibis's recovery. Two weeks later, on April 18, 2024, Chibis returned to office and the same day held a call with President Vladimir Putin, where the governor expressed his intention to seek a second term and received Putin's endorsement. \n\n\n== Candidates ==\nIn Murmansk Oblast candidates for Governor can be nominated by registered political parties or by self-nomination. Candidate for Governor of Murmansk Oblast should be a Russian citizen and at least 30 years old. Candidates for Governor should not have a foreign citizenship or residence permit. Each candidate in order to be registered is required to collect at least 7% of signatures of members and heads of municipalities. In addition, self-nominated candidates should collect 0.5% of signatures of Murmansk Oblast residents. Also gubernatorial candidates present 3 candidacies to the Federation Council and election winner later appoints one of the presented candidates.\n\n\n=== Declared ===\nAndrey Chibis (United Russia), incumbent Governor of Murmansk Oblast (2019–present)\n\n\n== See also ==\n2024 Russian regional elections\n\n\n== References ==",

It stars Raveena Tandon, Manav Vij, Chandan Roy Sanyal, Satish Kaushik, Anushka Kaushik, Jatin Goswami and others.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRaveena Tandon as Tanvi Shukla\nManav Vij as Siddharth Shukla\nChandan Roy Sanyal as Neelkanth Misra\nSatish Kaushik as Judge Arun Kumar Jha\nArijeet Kaurav as Sonu\nRaju Kher as J P Sharma, Tanvi's father\nAnushka Kaushik as Rinki Kumari\nAmbrish Kumar Shukla as Matadin, Rinki's father\nJatin Goswami as Raghubir Singh\nAlok Chatterjee as Daanveer Singh\nSushmita Mukherjee as Lata Jha, Arun Jha's wife\nDaya Shankar Pandey as Surendra Mohan\nRio Kapadia as Harsh Sinha\nIndra Kumar as Income Tax officer\nRajshree Thakkar as Mahua\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was announced in September 2022. Principal photography commenced on 16 November 2022. Filming wrapped on 23 November 2022.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nRaveena Tandon plays the lead role and she finished her shooting on 23 December 2022. Chandan Roy Sanyal was finalised for the role of a lawyer. Satish Kaushik played the role of the Judge. Anushka Kaushik also joined the movie with a pivotal role.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe movie was premiered on 29 March 2024 on Disney+ Hotstar.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIt received negative reviews, with praise for the performances, plot and criticism for derivative nature. \nGiving a poor 1.5 star out of 5 Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV opined \"The title isn't the only thing that is baffling about this film. The choice of Bhopal as filming location for a story set in Patna is strange, to say the least.\"\nShubhra Gupta of The Indian Express opined \"A climactic rigmarole mars it, but Patna Shuklla is still one of those you can watch simply because you want to see good women win.\"\nMonika Rawal Kukreja for Hindustan Times wrote \"At two hours 13 minutes, the film appears a tad stretched in the second half and could have gone for a crisper editing, especially in the scenes outside the court.\"\nRonak Kotecha of The Times of India rated the movie 3.5 stars out of 5 and wrote \"Despite a slow pace, Raveena’s flawless act keeps the viewer interest alive. Manav Vij is well-suited to play Siddharth, a man who has to strike a balance between his wife’s unwavering stand for what’s right and what is practically possible in a small town.\"\nSana Farzeen for India Today gave 2.5 stars out 5 and stated \"Bankrolled by Arbaaz Khan, the film gives Raveena Tandon a great platform to perform, something that the actor rightfully deserves.\"\nRohit Bhatnagar of The Free Press Journal praised Raveena Tandon's performance and stated \"Raveena Tandon is the lifeline of Patna Shuklla. She rides the entire film on her own shoulders quite well.\"\nPushpangi Raina of Outlook India wrote \"The movie doesn’t have abrupt cuts; however, there are a few seconds of black screens here and there, but those can be easily ignored.\"\nSukanya Verma of Rediff.com gave poor 2 stars out of 5 and stated \"Patna Shuklla's dull drama struggles to leave any impact as it goes about randomly introducing skeletons in everyone’s closet as its quick fix solution to anything.\"\nGautaman Bhaskaran of News18 felt the movie \"strongly resembles Jolly LLB\". He further stated \"The movie itself has many facets that run parallel to Jolly LLB. Judge Jha (late Satish Kaushik) in Patna Shuklla looks very similar to Judge Tripathi (Saurabh Shukla).\"\nShreyas Pande of Cinema Express also found the movie similar to Jolly LLB movie and stated \"The judges in Patna Shuklla and Jolly LLB are almost identical, and even the back-and-forth between the lawyers and judges in both films are similar.\"\nLikewise others, Bollywood Hungama reviewer also stated \"The comical side of the judge instantly reminds one of the Jolly LLB series. It also looks forced. Some of the arguments placed by Tanvi seemed weak and it didn’t look convincing.\"\nReviewing for The Week Suparna Sharma commented \"What’s worse is that the film can’t stay and applaud Tanvi in her big moment of victory.\"\nPratikshya Mishra of The Quint stated \"The flaws in Patna Shuklla are evident but the film has enough going for it to merit a watch.\"\nNandini Ramnath of Scroll.in praised Raveena's performance and opined \"The old-fashioned emphasis on moral probity leans a bit too heavily in favour of its crusading heroine. Tanvi’s courtroom tactics and legal acrobatics often bring her intelligence into question.\"\nRishil Jogani of Pinkvilla wrote \"Patna Shuklla is a well made legal drama with a very interesting twist in the last 20 odd minutes of the film.\"\nA critic from Telangana Today stated \"There are also issues of gender discrimination faced by women. Despite occasional flaws, it goes maintains a steady flow with an engaging narrative, comedy timing, and one-liners.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPatna Shuklla at IMDb",

        "content": "Hausa Ajami script refers to the practice of using the alphabet derived from Arabic script for writing of Hausa language.\nAjami is a name commonly given to alphabets derived from Arabic script for the use of various African languages, from Swahili to Hausa, Fulfulde, and Wolof.\nHausa ajami is an alphabet where vowel sounds are written using a mixture of combining marks and letters. Unlike Semitic languages such as Arabic that build words on consonant patterns and so normally hide vowel diacritics in the Arabic script, it can be difficult to read Hausa text without the full vowel information, and therefore Hausa retains all vowel diacritics in the text.\nIn Niger and Nigeria, there exists two general orthographic traditions, each derived from two Quranic orthographic practices. One of these is based on the Quran recitation and inscription of the 8th century religious scholar Hafs ibn Sulayman , the other based on the Quran recitation and inscription of another 8th Century scholar, Warsh. Hafs tradition is the most popular across the Muslim world, and especially in Egypt, the Levant, and the Arabian Peninsula. Warsh tradition is the second most popular tradition across the Muslim world, and has been especially popular in North Africa, West Africa, and Andalusia. In Niger and Nigeria, Warsh is the orthographic convention preferred by local Sufi schools and scholars (including Tijaniyyah and Qadiriyya schools), whereas Hafs is the orthographic convention preferred by Sunni schools and scholars, including the Salafi Izala Society. While technically such distinction between Sufis and Sunnis does not theologically exist, this is a good approximation of the sociolinguistic situation.\nWhile Hafs is generally always written in Naskh, Warsh is written either in Naskh, or in Maghrebi script, following North African traditions, and in a local calligraphic tradition.\nFrom Nigerian independence up until 2007, the Hausa text on Nigerian naira banknotes were written in Warsh script. Prior to independence, British West African pound banknotes included Hausa text written in Hafs script.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name 'Ajami' came to be used in such a way for the adoption of Arabic script to write a non-Arabic language in Africa. Originally, 'Ajami' referred to non-Arab language in Africa, as it did elsewhere in the Muslim world too, with Persian, Turkish, Malay, Spanish, etc. being referred to as 'Ajami'. Thus, in Northern Nigeria for example, languages such as Hausa and Fulfulde where referred to as 'Ajami languages'. Thus by extension, texts written in such languages were referred to as 'Ajami', simply meaning \"foreign\", and to be distinguished from texts written in Arabic. But, it was in colonial Northern Nigeria that the earlier notion of 'Ajami language' (Hausa, Fulfulde) was misinterpreted and transformed into 'Ajami script'.\nIt was within the context of this development that Mervyn Hiskett states that 'It [Hausa] is now written for official\nand scholastic purposes in the Roman script (with the addition of three special letters), but the older Arabic script\n(known as ajami) is still extensively used for private correspondence and religious tracts'.\nOver time, this misrepresentation by European Christian missionaries, colonial officials, and Africologists, was adopted by native Hausa-speaking scholars as well. For example, famed Hausa linguist, Ibrahim Yaro Yahaya, uses 'Ajami' in such a way.\n\n\n== History ==\nHausa Ajamī, the use of Arabic alphabet for non-Arabic language writing, has been\ndeveloped as a form of discourse by Islamic clerics in Hausa city states since the advent of\nIslam in the region through Malian cleric merchants in the 14th century. Although not widely\nspread, it nevertheless provided those fluent in its script with a literacy device that enabled\nthem to exchange written communication, without necessarily being fluent in the Arabic\nlanguage. The etymology of the word itself denotes a non-native Arab.\nThe use of Arabic script to write local languages of West Africa, including Hausa, started by the Islamic clerics in Hausa city states since the arrival of Islam in the region through Malian cleric merchants in the 14th century. Although not initially widely used, it nevertheless provided those fluent in its script with a literacy device that enabled them to exchange written communication, without necessarily being fluent in the Arabic. However, for many centuries, Arabic was the literary language of Hausa city-states, as it was seen as the more prestigious means of communication. In fact, for centuries, it was the semi-nomadic Fulfulde community of Northern Nigeria that wrote its native language in 'Ajami script' than the urban-rural Hausa community.\nPre-colonial Hausa writings in Arabic script have been described as mostly Islamic literature, usually in verse as opposed to 'essentially un-Islamic' oral prose, as well as some historical chronicles, folktales, official and private\ncorrespondence. But nevertheless, the development of Hausa Ajami orthography was both successful and marginalized by the predominance of Arabic. And thus, pre-colonial Hausa was never standardized, never diverged into a single set of conventions across different literatures. Another thing that can be concludied is that, geographically speaking, there were two poles of attraction in Hausa literature. One variety of Hausa Ajami may be described as Western or Sokoto-centred and close to the written traditions of the Central Niger region. Another variety, based in Kano, which looks like an offshoot of the venerable centuries-old tradition of Borno (Kanuri language) Ajami. Both were reflected not just in their specific conventions of transcription, but also in their respective styles of handwriting. This divergencep ersisted through the 19th and the 20th century, with the development of the two orthographic traditions, Warsh and Hafs.\nBritish and German colonization of West Africa, and specifically encroachment of Christian missionaries, coinciding with the Fula Jihads and the literary boom brought by the consolidation of the Sokoto Caliphate, resulted in the start of a 'golden age of Ajami', during which Arabic-script Hausa writings were 'flourishing in the 19th century and continuing into the 20th', prior to the decision of the British colonial authorities to Romanize the Hausa language in 1930. On the one hand, Islamic scholars and local rulers relied ever so greatly on Arabic-script Hausa to communicate and to express literature. On the other, the bureaucratic needs of the time, compelled mid-level colonial administrators to rely on Ajami Hausa. And thirdly, missionaries thought that using Ajami to write and communicate in the local language would best facilitate the spread of their work and would best connect them with the Hausa populous.\nDespite the disillusionment of bureaucrats, both colonial and post-independence natives, and despite the spread of Latin alphabet through secular education, Christian missionaries have remained interested in Ajami script as one of the ways to communicate in Hausa. Throughout the 20th and the 21st century, various translated Christian literature have been produced in Ajami, including a 2020 Bible translation into Ajami-script Hausa.\n\n\n== Alphabet ==\nAs Hausa Ajami script was never recognized and regulated officially, there has never been a top down imposition of a unified convention. Standardization of letters in Ajami has happened over time and in various stages, in synch with neighbouring Ajami traditions, as well as external factors.\nFor example, vowels in Hausa Ajami script, including representation of vowel [e], and differentiation of short versus long vowels, were one of the first aspects to be unified and standardized. Consonants on the other hand, especially consonant letters for representing sounds that don't exist in Arabic, took longer to become standardized. Some new letters were even coined in the late 19th and early 20th century, and because of the direct influence of the Boko alphabet (Latin alphabet). For example, whereas previously in writing, sounds [b] and [ɓ] may have usually been written with a singe letter ba 'ب‎', it was the innovation of introducing the separate letter in Latin alphabet that created an impetus for scholars writing in Ajami script, to innovate and introduce a separate Ajami letter for the distinct sound as well.\n\n\n=== Letters ===\nBelow is the list of letters of Hausa Ajami, in both Warsh and Hafs traditions. Beige highlight marks letters that are only used for writing of loan words of Arabic or European origin. Green highlight marks letters that are innovations of Hausa orthography and are not used in Arabic language.\n\n\n=== Vowels ===\nHausa comprises 5 basic vowels, each with a short and lengthened correspondence. There also two additional diphthongs. These comprise of [a], [e], [i], [o], [u] and their lengthened counterparts. It does need to be noted that vowels [o] and [e] are almost always in the long form, and rarely in the short form.\nIn normal daily Latin orthography, short and long vowels are not distinguished. Vowel lengths are thus only shown in Latin phonetic or phonemic transcriptions. However, in Ajami script, they are always written down. However, in spoken pronunciation, the contrast between vowel lengths does matter, and a difference in vowel length does change the meaning of a word. Vowel lengthening must be observed if the speaker wants to convey the proper meaning in Hausa. Failure to observe it may make his utterance meaningless. At best, such a failure may suggest to the Hausa listener that the subject is either a novice in the language or is a victim of speech defect. Thus, in this regard, Hausa is therefore more accurately written in Ajami than in Latin script.\nHausa is also a tonal language. Each of its five vowels may have low tone, high tone or falling tone. But tones are omitted and not written down, neither in normal daily Latin orthography nor in Ajami script.\nWhereas in Arabic, there are 3 diacritics corresponding to the vowels [a], [u], [i]; Hausa has 5 basic vowels. Vowels are written in an identical fashion in both Warsh-derived and Hafs-derived traditions of Hausa Ajami.\nIn Hausa, vowel [a] is shown as it would be in Arabic, with a fatha diacritic '◌َ'. A long vowel [aː] is indicated by writing an alif succeeding the letter and diacritic 'ـَا'.\nIn Hausa Ajami orthography, there is no distinguishing between [o] and [u]. They are both shown with damma diacritic '◌ُ'. Some languages in West Africa, especially in Western Sahel, do have a distinction, where the vowel [o] is marked with an inverted damma, but this is not the case in Hausa. Long vowels [oː] and [uː] are indicated by writing a waw succeeding the letter and diacritic 'ـُو'. There were some attempts at innovating a convention to show the vowel [o] in Hausa Ajami in the 19th and 20th centuries, but those did not catch on. In Hausa, the vowel [o] is almost always in its lengthened form. In a final position, the long vowel [oː] is distinguished from the long vowel [uː], by writing an additional alif + sukun diacritic 'ـُواْ'. The 2020 Hausa Bible translation uses alif + sukun diacritic in medial positions as well. Some other manuscripts place a sukun over the waw 'ـُوْ' which is written optionally.\nIn Hausa, vowels [i] and [e] are distinguished, vowel [i] shown with a kasra diacritic '◌ِ', while [e] is shown with a subscript dot diacritic, known as imāla. As mentioned before, Hausa Ajami orthography draws from the Warsh Quran recitation traditions. In Warsh, there are instnaces where, based on Old Arabic, the vowel [a] is raised and moved to the front, and is pronounced approximately as an [e]. This has been marked in Warsh Quran transcription, with an imala diacritic ◌ٜ.\nA long vowel [iː] is indicated by writing an ya succeeding the letter and diacritic 'ـِیـ ـِی'. Vowel [e] is considered a combined [a+i] vowel in Warsh Quranic recitation tradition. Thus a long vowel [eː] is indicated by a combined dotless ya + superscript alif 'ــٜىٰـ ـٜىٰ'.\nVowels at the beginning of a word (or in the middle of a word, but at the beginning of a syllable) require a letter to act as carrier of the diacritic, and in Hausa, this carrier letter has a glottal sound [ʔ]. While the expected letter for this role is alif 'ا', in Hausa, in some manuscripts and for some vowels, the letter ayn 'ع' is also used. Table below illustrates word-initial vowels with alif as its carrier. \n\nBelow table shows word-medial vowels in Hausa.\n\nBelow table shows word-final vowels in Hausa.\n\n\n=== Diphthong ===\nThere are two diphthongs in Hausa, represented in Latin by au and ai. As per Hausa phonotactics, neither vowel in a diphthong is a long vowel. These diphthongs are written with the letters waw and ya respectively, with sukun or zero-vowel diacritic on top:\n\n\n=== Palatization and Labialization ===\nThere are three letters in Hausa that can be subject to palatization (secondary articulation of a 'y' [j] sound) or labialization (secondary articulation of a [w] sound). These are 'G g / غ', 'K k / ک', and '‌Ƙ ƙ / ࢼ'. In Boko alphabet, digraphs, combining these letters with either 'y' or 'w' are used. In Ajami, new letters, with 3 dots, have been created for this purpose. Palatization and labialization are distinguished by the diacritic on top of these unique letters, fatha diacritic '◌َ' and  damma diacritic '◌ُ' respectively, and by whether these letters are followed by a waw or by a y. In Hausa, in most but not all cases, these palatized and labialized sounds are followed by an [a] vowel. In Ajami, thus, the subsequent [a] diacritic is dropped. Thus, if these letters are to be followed by a different vowel other than [a], the diacritic is placed on the follow-up letter.\n\n\n=== Punctuation ===\nMost Hausa Ajami punctuation is similar to Arabic, Persian, and other languages that use Arabic script, including the Arabic comma '،' and question mark '؟'. \nThe only distinction is, for a period, Hausa Ajami use the Quranic triple dot '؞' as opposed to a single dot.\n\n\n== Text samples ==\nArticle 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRobinson, Charles Henry.

        "content": "Yudas Sabaggalet (born 24 February 1964) is an Indonesian lecturer and politician from Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle who served two terms as regent of Mentawai Islands Regency between 2011-2016 and 2017–2022, and previously as the regency's vice-regent between 2006 and 2011. He also served as member of the regency's parliament when it was first created in 1999.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nYudas was born in Madubak Ugai, a village in South Siberut, Mentawai Islands as the youngest child with three siblings from a family of a farmer native of the village. His father died when he was five years old. He spent his childhood and early education on local elementary school while helping his family work on the field until the 3rd year. He then moved to a private school in Muara Siberut, living in the school dormitory and finished in 1977.Yudas then moved to Padang to pursue junior and then senior highschool, which he finished in 1985. A year later, he studied management at faculty of economy in Bung Hatta University, a private university in West Sumatra while also working at a Coca-Cola factory and gained bachelor's degree in 1994. He was an active member of the Indonesian Union of Catholic University Students. He continued his study at Gadjah Mada University in 1995 but never finished the study and instead choose to work in Bogor. He then returned to West Sumatra after the Asian financial crisis in 1998 and decided to enter politics, as well as continuing his study at Andalas University, getting master's degree at management in 2005. He worked as a lecturer at Taman Siswa University's faculty of economy in Padang since 2001, teaching both undergraduate and graduate students. He later also received doctorate in development study at Andalas University in 2023.\n\n\n=== Political career ===\nHe initially started his political career at Peace Love Nation Party (Indonesian:Partai Damai Kasih Bangsa), a Christian-based party in Indonesia. He gained a seat in the newly-formed Mentawai Islands Regency's parliament until 2004 when he decided to join Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDIP). However, he lost his seat next election in 2004 and decided to be running mate of Edison Saleleubaja who was running for regent of Mentawai Islands candidacy in 2006. He then ran for regent himself and won election in 2011, and then for second term in 2017.As Mentawai Islands was the poorest and the most isolated regency in the West Sumatra province,\nhe initiated several infrastructure projects such as Trans-Mentawai road, Rokot Airport, and establishing Mentawai Fast ferry route services connecting the islands within the regency. Other projects also included Peipei Airport and several port constructions proposed in 2017. To speed up construction of Trans-Mentawai road which was started in 2012 and to circumvent budget constraints, Yudas proposed to Ministry of Public Works and Housing to use Indonesian Army personnels to work on the road construction. By the end of his tenure in 2022 due to limited budget, only 37% of the road segments was finished. During the construction of Rokot Airport, he also proposed several names for the new airport, arguing that name of an airport should reflect the regional characteristics. Other than that, he also supported central government plan for a special economic zone in West Siberut in 2018.In 2017, he sided with indigenous communities against industrial forest permit in Siberut Island, arguing that it will harm the environment. He argued that tourism should be the main sector of the regency instead as it preserves native culture and traditions instead of the industrial forest. In 2022, he argued against newly passed law regarding status of West Sumatra province, which he said was not accommodating enough towards native Mentawai culture and only mentioned Minangkabau culture. After his tenure ended, he was subject to controversy of which he was accused of owning total of twenty land plots and house assets, of which he denied calling it \"nonsense\".\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nYudas is married to Rosmaida Sagurung and they have three children. He is a Catholic.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The North Island rugby league team is a rugby league team that represents the North Island of New Zealand. They first played in 1920 against the touring England team in Napier, Hawke's Bay. However the primary purpose of the side was to play against the South Island team, with the match often serving as a trial type match to chose the New Zealand international side.\n\n\n== Inter island matches ==\n\n\n=== 1920 ===\nThe England team was touring New Zealand following their tour of Australia where they had played 13 matches. They played Auckland, Rotorua, South Auckland (Waikato), New Zealand, and King Country, before a match was organised for them against a North Island team at Napier in the Hawke's Bay on August 4. The North Island team was relatively weak with only 8 of the 13 players chosen being New Zealand representatives when ordinarily the entire side would have been national representatives. The side included 5 local Hawke's Bay players (Pat Burrows, Edmund Downing, Percival Exeter, Con McCarthy, and Henry Pring). Aside from a loss to Auckland in their first game the England side made short work of all domestic opposition, including this North Island side who they thrashed 46-5.\n\n\n=== 1925 ===\n1925 saw the first ever 'proper' North Island rugby league team match in what was to become a near annual fixture over the ensuing decades. The match was played in \"unfavourable conditions\" at Carlaw Park before 4,000 spectators, making \"good football out of the question\". The match was largely a battle of the forwards though North Island backs Lou Brown, Ben Davidson, and Horace Dixon all crossed for tries. Forward Ernie Herring had an outstanding game scoring a hat trick.  Frank Delgrosso struggled with his goal kicking in the conditions, converting just one of their 7 tries. Neil Mouat scored all of the South Island's points with a try and 3 penalties. At halftime Neville St George came on for the North Island after Alf Townsend retired with a broken rib.\n\n\n=== 1926 ===\n The entire North Island team was composed of Auckland players with the exception of Wally Desmond from Wellington. Unlike the previous season which saw just 4,000 attend the match the crowd for the 1926 edition was an enormous 18,000 with the match described as \"brilliant\". The South Island backs were said to be \"Herculean\", \"fighting like tigers\". The northern backs were far to clever though and they put on several tries with the margin likely to have been larger if not for Peckham and Cole leaving the field through injury in the second half leaving them 2 players short.\n\n\n=== 1927 ===\n\n\n=== 1928 ===\n\n\n=== 1929 ===\nLen Scott was injured during the match and replaced by Allan Seagar for the North Island while for the South Island Sanders was injured and replaced by Doogan. In past years the North Island team was dominated by players from the Auckland competition however the North Island team on this occasion featured players from outside Auckland such as Ted Meyer, Dick Trautvettor, Bob Stephenson, Joe Menzies, Tom Timms, and Tassie Bergan.\n\n\n=== 1930 ===\nFor the North Island v South Island trial the Devonport and Ponsonby clubs gave permission for their jerseys to be worn by the respective sides. Mick O’Brien of the South Island team broke his tibia late in the match.\n\n\n=== 1931 ===\n The North Island had one of their largest ever wins over the South Island. Pat Meehan of the Marist club scored 4 tries, with New Zealand internationals Claude List (3), Edwin Abbott (2), Hec Brisbane (2), and Alan Clarke also scoring. Clarke also kicked 5 conversions and a penalty for 15 individual points. For the South Island Falgar scored 2 tries, with Johnny Dodds scoring a try and kicking their lone conversion.\n\n\n=== 1932 ===\nJim Amos left the field with an injured shoulder for the South Island team and was replaced by E O'Brien. Bert Cooke made his North Island debut and played brilliantly, scoring three tries for the winners in front of a crowd of 15,000. He had only recently converted to rugby league but his performance was instrumental in his selection for the New Zealand test team. Len Scott also scored three tries with Claude List crossing for one. Albert Laing converted three of the North Island's seven tries. Laing also made his debut for New Zealand after his effort, while Scott and List also gained New Zealand selection once more after having debuted for New Zealand in 1928. For the South Island J. Devonport and E. Hamberger scored a try each. Jim Amos had kicked two goals before being replaced. Jonas Masters kicked their other three goals.\n\n\n=== 1933 Not Played ===\n\n\n=== 1934 ===\n The match was described as \"by far the most brilliant North-South match seen in Auckland for many years\". The South Island led 13-3 at the half time break before a magnificent rally by the North Island saw them overcome the deficit and draw level following tries to George Tittleton and Bert Cooke, both of which were converted by R.E. Smith from the Hawke's Bay. The North side extended their lead through tries to Cliff Satherley, Wally Tittleton, Cooke, and then Lou Hutt before the South Island scored a consolation try to Billy Glynn.\n\n\n=== 1935 ===\nThis was the 10th inter-island match stretching back to 1925. The North Island had won 7, the South Island had won 1 in 1929, with a draw in 1930. Roy Bright, Wilf Hassan and McNeil (Richmond) were selected to play for the North Island but were unavailable. The North Island had 3 players debuting, Bill Telford, Ted Mincham, and W. Large (Hawke's Bay).\n\n\n=== 1936 ===\nDuring the match Reg Haslam was running with the ball when he began falling into a hole which had fallen into the ground. In the meantime he had passed the ball and play moved away but was forced to stop once the referee realised what had happened. It had formed near a drain where the water had washed away the soil beneath the ground. A ball boy was photographed standing in the hole ‘buried’ to his waist. The gate receipts for the match were £608 19/ with 15,000 in attendance at the match and the trial curtain-raiser.\n\n\n=== 1937 Not played ===\n\n\n=== 1938 ===\nBrian Riley was initially named to play for the North Island side but as he was unable to get leave from work to potentially tour Australia if selected he was replaced in the North Island side. The result showed the absolute domination of the Auckland competition over other parts of New Zealand with 12 of the 13 players drawn from the Auckland club competition. Joe Cootes was the only player from outside Auckland, playing in Wellington. For the North Island Des Herring scored 3 tries, and Rangi Chase 2, with 7 other players (Gordon Midgley, Walter Brimble, Jack Satherley, Joe Cootes, Angus Gault, Jack Brodrick, and Clarry McNeil) also crossing the line. Jack Smith kicked 10 conversions and also kicked a penalty. The only scorer for the South Island was P. Scott who kicked a penalty.\n\n\n=== 1939 ===\nWally Tittleton was chosen as the North Island captain while Rex King captained the South Island.\n\n\n=== 1940-43 Not Played ===\n\n\n=== 1944 ===\nThis was the first time since 1939 that the North Island v South Island match had been played. The North Island won comfortably scoring 9 tries to 3. Roy Nurse was the only North Island player who had previously played for them with the other 12 on debut. Ralph Martin had played for Manukau from 1940 to 1944 had moved to Wellington during the year for his army training and had joined the Korodale club and also represented Wellington following that point. Hawea Mataira had originally been selected but was travelling to Wellington with the Auckland Waterside Workers team to play in their annual fixture with Wellington Waterside and was replaced by Ririnui but then on match day he himself was replaced in the side by Wellington's F. Andrews who was in his first year of rugby league. Owen Brooks from the Waikato had a remarkable day scoring 3 tries and kicking 8 conversions for a personal tally of 25 tries. Joe Murray from the Manukau club also scored 3 tries. Pouvi (Robert) Salaia, one of the first Pacific born players involved in New Zealand rugby league, scored for the North Island. For the South Island New Zealand international John Newton scored twice and Ces Davison converted all three of their tries.\n\n\n=== 1945 ===\n The South Island team featured 2 Wellington players (F Moses and Hector Mallinder) for the first time in its history, rendering it a South Island team in name only. G Moyes, chosen at lock from Waikato was unavailable as he was feeling unwell so his place was taken by Fred James of the City side and he played well scoring 2 tries. Veteran Arthur Kay played for the North Island in the centre position. He was in his 13th season of senior rugby league having debuted for Ponsonby in 1933. The crowd was estimated at between 15 and 20,000 which was the largest seen at the ground for many years.\n\n\n== Players, appearances and scoring (1920–1945) ==\n\nNotes\nWally Desmond moved to Wellington in 1926 and played for the representative side against Waikato (South Auckland); however there was then no club competition in Wellington.\nIn 1925 Neville St George came on as a replacement for Alf Townsend at halftime.\nIn 1929 Allan Seagar replaced Len Scott at halftime.\nIn 1931 the Marist and Devonport clubs fielded a combined team as a short-lived requirement by the Auckland Rugby League.\nIn 1944 Ralph Martin was representing Wellington. He had played several seasons for Manukau in Auckland but had moved to Wellington as part of his Army training and was a member of the Korodale club.\n\n\n== Record by Opponent from 1920 to 1945 ==\n\n\n== Representation by province (1920-1945) ==\nJim Laird is the only player to represent the North Island for more than one province (Waikato in 1932, and Auckland in 1935).\n\n\n== Representation by club (1920-1945) ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Black Hole is the penultimate episode of the first season of The Ren & Stimpy Show that originally that aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on 23 February 1992. It is the third episode in a loosely linked trilogy known as the \"space episodes\" set in the show-within-the show, The Adventures of Commander Hòek and Cadet Stimpy.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe Adventures of Commander Hòek and Cadet Stimpy is a parody of Star Trek that served as a show-within-the-show. Ren and Stimpy are once again piloting a space ship though the depths of space when their ship is unwillingly sucked into a black hole. On the other side of the black, Ren and Stimpy find themselves in trapped a strange, surreal world that causes both of them to frequently mutate into grotesque versions of themselves. Ren wants to find a way to escape the alternative dimension, but is frustrated by Stimpy's stupidity and annoying habits. Ren and Stimpy stumble across a mountain of socks meant for  left feet, and Ren realizes that the mountain of socks are where all of the Earth's missing socks have gone. He has visions of being welcomed as a hero upon his return to Earth for discovering the mountain of socks, but must first find a way to return home. Stimpy learns from reading a book that they must leave by 3 pm or be struck forever in the alternative dimension and there is a bus stop at the Trans-Dimensional Gateway that will take them out. Ren and Stimpy find a bus that runs to Jersey City, but are expelled from the bus when they lack the exact change. Rather than suffer continuing mutations, Ren and Stimy decided to commit suicide by setting their molecules to implode. After making the settlings, Stimpy reveals that he had the exact change all long and just forgot it, leading Ren to call him an idiot. Both Ren and Stimpy die when their molecules implode.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of John Kricfalusi\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nThe Bus driver-Harris Peet\nGeorge Liquor-Harris Peet\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe idea for a trilogy that would serve as both a parody of Star Trek and as a show-within-the-show was created during a writing session held during a drinking bout in a bar between John Kricfalusi and Jim Smith. The precise story of the production of Black Hole is heavily disputed. Bob Camp claims that he co-directed Black Hole, a claim rejected by Krcifalusi who states he directed Black Hole himself. Black Hole does not list a director in its credits, which apparently reflected a dispute within the Spümcø at the time over who had directed Black Hole. Camp claims to have served as the co-director, saying he got \"his feet wet as a director\" on Black Hole, a claim categorically rejected by Kricfalusi who states that he was the only director on Black Hole. Kricfalusi explained the lack of a director's credit on Black Hole by saying: \"A director is somebody  who right from the start of a story, follows it all the way through to the end, and it's his idea and vision\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe critic Kendra Ackeman listed Black Hole as one of the best of the show with a \"entertaining\" and surreal story. By contrast, the journalist Thad Komorowski described Black Hole as a failure that had no coherent plot, substituted \"silliness for substance\" and seems not to had any single person directing it. The animation expert Martin Goodman wrote: \"On a surface level, they were funny, subversive cartoons with an offbeat retro look, but a deeper examination revealed them to be an encapsulation of some of our darkest fears, ones in which the soul and body are powerless against a world out of balance. Perhaps the most striking example of this was the episode Black Hole, which finds the duo stranded on a bizarre, hostile planet; they begin to mutate into progressively hideous versions of themselves before imploding at the end of the cartoon.\"\n\n\n== Books and articles ==\nDobbs, G.

The ruins were demolished in 1813.: 120  Nothing remains of the old church and much of the masonry has been reused in the church of Creeting St Mary.

        "content": "Neukloster Abbey was a Cistercian abbey in Wiener Neustadt, in Lower Austria. In 1881, it became a priory of Heiligenkreuz Abbey.\n\n\n== History ==\nContrary to the Cistercian custom of only building monasteries in remote areas, an exception was made for King Frederick. Frederick succeeded in freeing up the Dominican monastery next to his residence (founded by Leopold VI in 1227) for Cistercians from Rein Abbey. Because of the new beginning compared to the previous Dominican monastery and in allusion to the Cistercian original monastery of Cîteaux as the novum monasterium par excellence, Frederick's court monastery was called the \"new\" monastery. The founding abbot was from Rein, but the second (from 1446) was Gottfried von Otterstätt, previously cellarer at  Maulbronn Abbey.\nIn the decades following its foundation, the Neukloster monks were granted dispensations in order to work as pastors. Normally, laymen and women were not allowed to enter the Cistercians' convent churches, but a document from 1457 allows the presence of women at the rood screen during the celebration of mass in the Neukloster.Emperor Frederick was imaginative when it came to the abbey's endowment: the fortress of Rohr near Wildon was confiscated as a rebel estate and donated to Neukloster. The previous owner had probably died as a partisan of Albrecht VI. An annual payment of 300 pounds pfennigs from the parish of St. Peter in Ljubljana was also made to the new monastery.\nIn 1446, a large carved altar was erected in the abbey church, which is now the Wiener Neustädter Altar in St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna.\nIn 1467, Eleonor of Portugal, the wife of Emperor Frederick, was buried in the apse of the abbey church. Three children of the imperial couple are also buried there. But the burial place for which the entire Cistercian foundation project had been intended did not materialize: Emperor Frederick himself was buried in St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna in a magnificent tomb that had originally been placed (empty) in the chancel of the Neuklosterkirche. There are several references to the imperial benefactor amidst the coats of arms along the nave's ceiling. The larger version of his famous AEIOU monogram appears twice.From 1797 to October 1803, the monastery served as a residence for the governor of Lombardy, Archduke Ferdinand Karl of Austria-Este, his wife Maria Beatrice d'Este and their children, after they had been exiled during the Coalition Wars.The Josephine reforms caused the monastery a great deal of trouble, but it was not abolished. In 1784, the church was rededicated as the second of Wiener Neustadt's parishes. In 1804, a monastery school was opened, which was transferred to state administration in 1871.\nIn 1793, Mozart's Requiem was performed in the collegiate church for the first time in its original purpose, during a Requiem Mass for Count Walsegg's deceased wife.The monastery suffered for centuries from insufficient funding; economic problems were the reason that in 1880/81 the Neukloster monastery was united with Heiligenkreuz Abbey, some 30 km away, as a unio extinctiva; as the convent died out, the property became a Heiligenkreuz priory.\nIn May 2017, a collection of around 4,700 art objects, known as the Kunst- und Wunderkammer (Cabinet of Art and Wonders), was opened. The monastery was an essential part of the Lower Austrian State Exhibition in 2019. A \"room within a room\" made of glass was built for viewing the library. The east façade towards the garden, the Chapel of the Holy Cross, and the baroque refectory with its frescoes by Johann Baptist Bergl were also restored and refurbished.\n\n\n== Neukloster Abbots ==\n\n\n== Inscriptions ==\nAbove the gate to the south aisle of the cloister, which was erected in 1767, is a text attributed to Bernhard von Clairvaux, from the Epistola ad Fratres de Monte Dei: In religione vivit homo purius, cadit rarius, surgit velocius, incedit cautius, quiescit securius, irrigatur frequentius, purgatur citius, moritur confidentius, remuneratur copiosius (\"As a monk, a man lives more purely, falls less often, rises more quickly, walks more securely, sleeps better, becomes angry less often, becomes pure more quickly, dies more confidently and receives a greater reward\").\n\n\n== Other tombs ==\nFor Empress Eleonore, see above. The New Monastery is the burial place of the West Hungarian noble family of the Counts of Mattersdorf-Forchtenstein from Aragon (Spain).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nFranz Xaver Schweickhardt: Darstellung des Erzherzogthums Österreich unter der Ens, durch umfassende Beschreibung aller Burgen, Schlösser, Herrschaften, Städte, Märkte, Dörfer, Rotten etc. etc., topographisch-statistisch-genealogisch-historisch bearbeitet und nach den bestehenden vier Kreis-Vierteln [alphabetisch] gereiht.

        "content": "Dick Hall (May 12, 1938–November 2, 2022) was a Mississippi politician who served on the Mississippi Transportation Commission for the Central District from 1999 to 2019, the longest tenure of any commissioner in state history. He also served in the Mississippi State Senate and Mississippi House of Representatives for three terms each. He was a Republican.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHall was born on May 12, 1938, in Vicksburg, Mississippi, but grew up in the Fondren area of Jackson, Mississippi.

In 1988, he was elected the Mississippi State Senate for District 25, suceeding Sen. Con Maloney; Hall served three consecutive terms. He chaired the Environmental Committee, the Public Health Committee and the Energy Committee. In the legislature, he helped pass legislation like the Education Reform Act of 1982, the 1987 Four-Lane Highway Program, the Budget Reform Act of 1992, and the Mental Health Reform Act of 1997.\nHall was appointed by Kirk Fordice to the Mississippi Transportation Commission on April 12, 1999, to fill an unexpired term from Wayne Burkes. He retired in 2020, making his total tenure 20 years and 9 months, the longest of any commissioner in state history.

        "content": "St James' Church is an Anglican church in Eve Hill, in Dudley, West Midlands, England, and in the Diocese of Worcester. It was built in 1840, and it is Grade II listed.\n\n\n== History ==\nDudley grew in the early 19th century, so that the existing churches, of St Edmund and St Thomas, were insufficient for the population. St James was built as a sister church to St John's Church in the Kates Hill area of Dudley; both were designed in Early English style by William Bourne and were built from 1838 to 1840. They were dedicated by the Bishop of Worcester Robert Carr in July 1840, this church being dedicated, like Dudley Priory, to St James. The building was funded by private subscriptions, donations from the Worcester Society for erecting churches, and from the Church Commissioners. It originally seated about 1000 people, the number being later reduced.\nBoth churches were originally chapels of ease to the Church of St Thomas. The Parish of St James was created in 1844.\nRestoration and improvements were carried out in 1869: the chancel and clerestory were rebuilt, galleries were added, and an organ chamber and vestry were added.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThere is a nave with north and south aisles, galleries above the aisles, and a chancel. The west tower has tall lancet-shaped bell-openings in pairs on each side of the upper stage. The arcades, of seven bays, to the aisles have thin columns with foliage capitals.\nThere is an ornate wrought-iron rood screen. The pulpit, given to the church in 1869, is of Caen stone and depicts saints and biblical figures. The font was given to the church in 1869 by the vicar of Dudley, the Rev James Caulfield Browne. The stained-glass east window, of three lights, was given to the church by the widow of John Roberts, a surgeon who died in 1850.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Inspector Rishi is a 2024 Tamil language horror crime drama television series created, written and directed by J.S. Nandhini for Amazon Prime Video. It stars Naveen Chandra, Sunaina Yella, Kanna Ravi, Kumaravel, Meesha Ghoshal, Semmalar Annam, Gajaraj and others.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAn inspector, Rishi, loses his eyesight in one eye during a shootout, fails to save his pregnant girlfriend and gets transferred into a jungle area where he must have to solve the cases behind the myths.\n\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n\n== Release ==\nInspector Rishi was released on 29 March 2024 on Amazon Prime Video along with dubbed versions in Hindi, Telugu, Malayalam, and Kannada languages.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nSaibal Chatterjee of NDTV stated \"What Inspector Rishi does with great skill is probe the myths and ingrained belief systems that inevitably exist on the boundaries of a world of human greed and exploitation.\"\nBhuvanesh Chandar of The Hindu stated \"Unlike anything seen in the Tamil horror space, the vanaratchi makes for a fascinating horror subject, and having such a unique spectre in a setting like a forest helps a horror series that consciously shies away from the routine genre tropes like jump scares and gore. But though horror fans may not have many complaints, Inspector Rishi isn’t quite the best investigative thriller out there.\"\nChirag Sehgal of News18 rated the series 3 stars out of 5 and wrote \"The series plays out like a slow-burner getting us impatient at times, but the screenplay (although I could not see why it should not have been shorter) does effectively create an eerie atmosphere. And the jungle setting bathed in mist and mystery sends shivers down our spines.\"\nSonal Pandya for Times Now rated the series 3 out of 5 and wrote, \"The dialogue is mostly expository, but it lays the groundwork for each episode.\"\nJanani K for India Today wrote \"‘Inspector Rishi’ fails in this aspect as the twists and turns remind us of many Tamil films, including ‘Whistle’. The show could have been a little more taut for it to have maximum impact.\"\nNandini Ramnath of Scroll.in stated, \"Several characters are plagued by terrifying visions, which convince them that Vanaratachi is on the rampage, even as human villains do their work.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nInspector Rishi at IMDb \nInspector Rishi at Rotten Tomatoes",

The satellites are built by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) and then transported to Taiyuan for launch. Their main uses are in the fields of atmospheric data for weather prediction, ionosphere, gravity and climate research, as well as disaster prevention. Like the Yunhai-2 series, the satellites reportedly use the Global Navigation Satellite System Radio Occultation (GNSS-RO).\n\n\n== Satellites ==\nAs of March 29, 2024, there are 2 satellites in the Yunhai-3 constellation in orbit, Yunhai-3 01 and Yunhai-3 02.\n\nㅤ\n\n\n=== Yunhai-3 01 ===\n\nYunhai-3 01 was launched on November 11, 2022, aboard a Long March 6A rocket from LC-9A at Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in China. It was launched into a sun-synchronous orbit and given the COSPAR ID \"2022-151A\". It was placed into an ~856 x 855 km orbit with an inclination of 98.8 degrees. The satellite is still in operation as of March 29, 2024. The upper stage of the Long March 6A used to launch Yunhai-3 01 broke up in orbit into 37 pieces of debris, possibly due to a propellant explosion. Nine of the 37 pieces of debris currently remain in orbit.\nㅤ\nㅤ\nㅤ\nㅤ\nㅤ\n\n\n=== Yunhai-3 02 ===\n\nYunhai-3 02 was launched on March 26, 2024, on a Long March 6A from LC-9A at Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center. It was also launched into a sun-synchronous orbit. As of March 29, 2024, it is in an ~864 x 847 km orbit with an inclination of 98.82 degrees.\nㅤㅤ\nㅤ\nㅤ\nㅤ\nㅤ\nㅤ\nㅤ\nㅤ\nㅤ\nㅤ\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Gorge railway station on the Palmerston North - Gisborne Line was located in the Tararua District of the Manawatū-Whanganui region in New Zealand’s North Island.\nThe station opened on 2 February 1900 and closed on 21 October 1965. It is unusual in being one of only six stations whose name begins with the word The.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nThe Gorge station was opened in 1900 as a simple passenger halt at the Woodville entrance to the Manawatū Gorge.  The station consisted of a simple passenger platform and shelter on the river side of the railway, alongside a backshunt with capacity for 18 wagons, which was used for service purposes when bridge gangs were working in the Gorge. \nA review in 1936 showed a tablet hut had been established sometime in the proceeding years and in 1937 approval was given for a loop to be installed next to the backshunt to serve limestone traffic. At 8.00am on Wednesday 20 December 1939, the station was closed as a Holiday Switchout Tablet station, but lime traffic continued as the mainstay of the station's output and it was still noted as being a switch-out tablet station in 1954.\nIn 1962 the station was noted as having two loops, with the second loop also having a loading bin. In that year the first loop was removed and the second converted into a backshunt operated from the Woodville end of the station. However, by 1965 the remaining siding to the Gorge Lime Company was closed and by 1967 the remaining tracks had been lifted.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Kleanthes K. Grohmann is a German linguist, academic, and author. He is a professor of Biolinguistics in the Department of English Studies at the University of Cyprus and the founding Director of the Cyprus Acquisition Team (CAT Lab).Grohmann's research focuses on biolinguistics, with emphasis on syntactic theory, language acquisition and development, language pathologies, and multilingualism. He has authored, co-authored, and edited research articles and books including Prolific Domains: On the Anti-locality of Movement Dependencies, InterPhases: Phase-Theoretic Investigations of Linguistic Interfaces, The Cambridge Handbook of Biolinguistics, and the textbook Understanding Minimalism. He is also the founding co-editor of the book series Language Faculty and Beyond.\nGrohmann is a member of the International Network in Biolinguistics, and has held various editorial positions. He is the founding Editor-in-Chief of Biolinguistics, and Associate Editor for the special section on Autism in Frontiers in Psychiatry.\n\n\n== Education ==\nGrohmann obtained a bachelor's degree in Linguistics from the University of Wales, Bangor (UK) in 1996 under the supervision of Ian Roberts and a PhD in linguistics from the University of Maryland, College Park (USA) in 2000, where his doctoral advisor was Norbert Hornstein.\n\n\n== Career ==\nGrohmann began his academic career as a Research Fellow at the Center for General Linguistics, Typology and Universals (ZAS Berlin) and as a Postdoc at the Goethe University Frankfurt from 2001 to 2002. Subsequently, he joined the University of Cyprus as a Visiting Lecturer, becoming Visiting Assistant Professor and later assistant professor of Theoretical Linguistics in 2004. He was promoted to associate professor of Biolinguistics in 2009. Since 2015, he has been serving as Professor of Biolinguistics in the Department of English Studies at the University of Cyprus.Outside the University of Cyprus, Grohmann became a Research Associate in the Center for Research on Bilingualism at Bangor University (2011–2014) and has been an International Advisory Board Member of the University of Illinois Bilingualism Research Laboratory since 2011.In 2010, he co-founded the Linguistic Society of America (LSA) Special Interest Group for Biolinguistics and has been serving as the Director of the Cyprus Acquisition Team (CAT Lab) since its foundation in 2008.\n\n\n== Research ==\nGrohmann has contributed to the field of linguistics by studying the syntax, semantics, and pragmatics of Wh-question formation, pronominal grammar, morpho-syntax, movement diagnostics, clause structure, non-finiteness, computation, predication, and related topics. He is most known for his proposal that movement dependencies have to span a minimum (structural) distance, known as anti-locality. His theoretical approach to the scientific study of language is rooted in the Chomskyan tradition of generative grammar, the so-called Minimalist Program.\n\n\n== Works ==\nGrohmann has authored, co-authored and co-edited works focusing on biolinguistics, psycholinguistics and socio-syntax. His 2003 book Prolific Domains: On the Anti-locality of Movement Dependencies explored anti-locality, an approach to syntactic computation and clause structure, introducing domains to restrict movement and offering a unified account of standard and anti-locality across clauses. In her review for the Language, Asya Pereltsvaig commented: \"The book is clearly written and well argued. In addition to its contribution as a research monograph, it can be used as a text for an advanced undergraduate or graduate syntax course.\"In 2013, Grohmann co-edited The Cambridge Handbook of Biolinguistics with Cedric Boeckx, exploring language development, evolution, and neuroscience, covering topics such as the language instinct, critical period hypothesis, and bilingualism. He also published a textbook, Understanding Minimalism alongside Norbert Hornstein and Jairo Nunesa, which introduces minimalist grammar, contrasting it with Government and Binding analyses. Mary Aizawa Kato remarked, \"The book is highly recommended for all students of natural language syntax and generativists in particular.\"\n\n\n=== Biolinguistics ===\nGrohmann researched biolinguistics throughout his career. He outlined foundational questions in biolinguistics, distinguishing it from generative grammar, and proposed a research agenda on language pathology in comparative biolinguistics. With Maria Kambanaros, Evelina Leivada, Natalia Pavlou, Charley Rowe, and other students, postdocs, and colleagues from the CAT Lab, he explored language development in Cypriot Greek, introducing \"bi-x\" with emphasis on \"(discrete) bilectalism\" and the Socio-Syntax of Development Hypothesis to understand the connection between biolinguistic implications and clitic placement acquisition.\n\n\n=== Psycholinguistics ===\nGrohmann's work on psycholinguistics encompassed language development and performance, particularly in children. In a 2014 study with Marina Varnava, he investigated how Cypriot Greek-speaking children aged 4 to 9 acquire the interpretation of wh-questions, revealing developmental discrepancies in a diglossic environment.In joint work with Maria Kambanaros, Grohmann also looked into how children with specific language impairment (SLI) use general all-purpose (GAP) verbs as a sign of immature language, emphasizing the distinction from light verbs in language development. Additionally, they examined the language performance of a child with 22q11 deletion syndrome at ages 6 and 10, revealing improved morphosyntactic abilities over time but no changes in nonverbal IQ or vocabulary.Collaborating with Christiana Christodoulou, Grohmann analyzed subjunctive clause comprehension in Greek Cypriot bilectal children with Down syndrome, finding parallel performance with typically developing children and unaffected acquisition by linguistic differences.\n\n\n=== Multilingualism ===\nGrohmann has investigated multilingualism and its impact on language acquisition. In joint research, he observed multilingual children with specific language impairment showing a consistent preference for retrieving nouns over verbs, suggesting a shared grammatical principle across languages. He also used cognates as an effective intervention for multilingual children with specific language impairment, resulting in significant improvement in English and cross-linguistic transfer effects to Bulgarian and Greek.Grohmann and colleagues found executive control advantages in bilectal children (Cypriot Greek and Standard Modern Greek) over monolinguals, linked to working memory and inhibition, emerging after considering lower language proficiency.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Selected books ===\nProlific Domains: On the Anti-locality of Movement Dependencies (2003), John Benjamins; ISBN 978-1588114419\nUnderstanding Minimalism (2005, with Norbert Hornstein & Jairo Nunes), Cambridge University Press; ISBN 978-0521531948\nInterPhases: Phase-Theoretic Investigations of Linguistic Interfaces (2009, ed.), Oxford University Press; ISBN 978-019954113\nThe Cambridge Handbook of Biolinguistics (2013, ed. with Cedric Boeckx), Cambridge University Press; ISBN 978-0521761536\nMultifaceted Multilingualism (2024, ed.), John Benjamins; ISBN 978-9027214638\n\n\n=== Selected articles ===\nCastillo, J.

In the AFC Cup, they finished third in their group, having gotten a historic first-ever win over Myanmar's Shan United as well as losses to Australia's Central Coast Mariners and Cambodia's Phnom Penh Crown. However, the club crashed out in the semi-finals of the 2023 Copa Paulino Alcantara after losing to then-non-league side Davao Aguilas. The club sacked head coach Joshua Schirmer and brought in Turkish coach Memiş Özata as well as the returning Levent Öztürk. After managing to retain most of its local core, the club replaced its departing foreign players with players largely of Dutch and Surinamese nationalities, such as winger Zamoranho Ho-A-Tham and midfielder Guytho Mijland.\n\n\n== Squad ==\nAs of 29 March 2024\n\n\n== Transfers ==\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

        "content": "Lois Audrey Pittom (4 July 1918 — 5 April 1990), known as Audrey Pittom, was a British Civil Servant; her career included roles as an Inspector of Factories, Deputy Chief Inspector of Factories, Under-Secretary in the Health and Safety Executive, Department of Employment.\n\n\n== Education ==\nPittom was educated at Laurels School, Wroxall Abbey, Warwick; and St Anne's College, Oxford, where she was awarded a BA (Hons) degree in 1939.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAudrey Pitton was appointed as an Inspector of Factories in 1945; she was promoted to Superintending Inspector, Nottingham, in 1967; Deputy Chief Inspector of Factories in 1970; and Under-Secretary in the Health and Safety Executive, Department of Employment in 1975.\nPittom had an interest in ergonomics and occupational health and had the nickname “Seats Pittom”.\nWhen she was appointed Under-Secretary in the 1970s she said: “If you really want to give health a boost it must come first in the title”. Her concern was the long-term occupational health effects on workers as well as from the risks posed by accidents. In 1977 upon the introduction of a scheme under which toxic properties of substances would be legally notifiable, she wrote “In the past, a number of substances have been introduced which have subsequently proved to have tragic and sometimes fatal effects, perhaps long after they have first been used. In introducing this scheme, we are concerned with the health of those at work not only today but also in the future”.\nIt is reputed that the title of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, and the wider use of the term ‘Health and Safety’ was coined by Pittom. She was appointed Under-Secretary in charge of health policy when the Health and Safety Executive was formed in 1975. Formally the Heath and Safety Executive was a 3-person body corporate comprising a Director General, a Deputy Director General and a third senior official. The first post-holders were John Howard Locke (DG); Bryan Hugh Harvey (DDG) and Audrey Pittom head of the Hazardous Substances Branch.\nPittom was deputy chair of the committee established after the Flixborough Disaster in 1974 where 28 people were killed. She was also Director for Hazardous Substances for the Ministry of Health.\nPittom was one of the signatories of the 1978 Canvey Report which investigated the hazards from various activities on Canvey Island.\nAudrey Pittom became a Member of the Association of University Women in 1966. She remained active in her local Association after her retirement.\n\n\n== Retirement ==\nShe retired from the civil service on 1 July 1978 when she was 60.\nFollowing her retirement, she was a parish councillor for the Parish of Barby, Northamptonshire.\nShe was appointed Companion of the Bath (CB) in the New Year Honours 1979.\n\n\n== Personal ==\nLois Audrey Pittom was born in Barby Northamptonshire, the second of three daughters of Thomas Pittom, farmer and landowner, and his wife Hylda (née Ashby). The other daughters were Hylda E. Pittom born in Rugby District in 1915 and Gillian Mary Pittom born in Rugby District on 26 November 1923.\nShe gave her recreations as gardening and sight-seeing in Europe.\nAfter retiring she lived at 1 Rectory Lane, Barby, Northamptonshire where she died of cancer on 5 April1990. Her funeral service was held at Barby parish church on 12 April 1990 followed by cremation.\nAudrey Pittom never married.\nHer estate was valued at £268,479 when probate was granted in July 1990. Charities received a total  of £18,000.\n\n\n== See also ==\nJohn Howard Locke\nHealth and Safety Executive\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Lorenz Manuel Hilty is a Swiss computer scientist and author most known for his work on the sustainability aspects of digital technologies. He is Professor at the University of Zurich in Switzerland (UZH), Sustainability Delegate of UZH and Director of the Zurich Knowledge Center for Sustainable Development.Hilty is an Honorary Fellow of the ICT for Sustainability (ICT4S) conference and held the position of Associate Editor for the Journal Environmental Modelling and Software.\n\n\n== Education ==\nHilty obtained a doctoral degree in Computer Science from the University of Hamburg (UHH) in 1991. He then conducted postdoctoral research projects focusing on methods for computational modeling of traffic and its environmental impacts at the University of St. Gallen (HSG) (1992), UHH (1993–1995) and the University of Ulm (1996–1998), working alongside Franz-Josef Radermacher. He later submitted his post-doctoral habilitation thesis titled \"Environmental Information Processing – Contributions of Informatics to Sustainable Development\" at UHH, which was accepted in 1997.\n\n\n== Scientific career ==\nIn 1998, Hilty was appointed as Professor of Information Systems at the University of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland. In 2000, he initiated the research program Sustainability in the Information Society at Empa Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology. From 2004 to 2010, he set up and headed Empa's Laboratory for Technology and Society. His research work at Empa was accompanied by teaching appointments at the University of Basel and St. Gallen and a Guest Professorship for New Media and Sustainability at the Institute for Social Ecology in Vienna. He joined UZH as a professor of Informatics and Sustainability at the Department of Informatics in 2010. In parallel, he was an Affiliated Professor at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm from 2013 to 2018, where he worked with the Centre for Sustainable Communications (CESC). Since 2014, he has also served as the Sustainability Delegate of the executive board of UZH.Hilty was appointed as an Expert to the Commission for Ethics and Technology at the Swiss Academy of Engineering Sciences in 2006, served as the Swiss Delegate to IFIP TC9 Computers and Society from 2002 to 2008 (2006 to 2008 as Vice Chair), and was a board member of the Swiss Informatics Society from 2003 to 2011. He initiated and chaired the first ICT for Sustainability conference ICT4S 2013 in Zurich and served on the Council of the University of Constance from 2019 to 2023.\n\n\n== Research ==\nHilty's research interests include the social and ecological opportunities and risks of digital technologies. His laboratory at Empa became known for a System Dynamics model on the environmental impact of ICT in the European Union and for technology assessments of pervasive computing based on the precautionary principle.Hilty has contributed to the conceptualization of the interdisciplinary field of research between ecological sustainability and digital technologies, and later played a key role in the emergence of ICT4S (Information and Communication Technology for Sustainability) as an interdisciplinary field of research and an international community. Under his leadership, collaborating research groups at Empa and UZH investigated environmental aspect of digital technologies in detail, including the local and global flow of waste electronic equipment and the consequences for metal availability.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2023 – Honorary Fellow Award, ICT4S\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Selected books ===\nInformation Systems for Sustainable Development (2005) ISBN 978-1591403449\nInformation Technology and Sustainability: Essays on the Relationship between Information Technology and Sustainable Development (2008) ISBN 978-3837019704\nWhat Kind of Information Society?

        "content": "Petro Ivanovych Gadz (Ukrainian: Петро Іванович Гадз; born 21 August 1960) is a Ukrainian agro-entrepreneur, public figure and music teacher who is a recipient of the Hero of Ukraine in 2012. He is also the founder and director of the vegetable and fruit farm company Farm GADZ. Additionally, he is also the deputy chairman of the Agrarian Union of Ukraine.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBorn on 21 August 1960, in the Ukrainian village of Zelena. Gadz was born into a farming family in the Ternopil Oblast, laying the foundation for his agricultural background. His educational journey began at Buchach Children's Music School, Ternopil Music School in 1978, followed by graduation from the Kyiv Institute of Culture (now Kyiv National University of Culture and Arts) in 1986.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThroughout his career, Gadz held various teaching positions, including roles at music schools in Monastyrsky and Dzhuryn. Transitioning into administrative roles, he served as director of the music school in Yazlovka from 1984 to 1995 before venturing into entrepreneurship until 2001. Since then, he has been actively involved in agricultural leadership, notably as chairman of the supervisory board of the Buchachagrokhlibprom Society in the Ternopil Oblast.\nGadz's political engagement began in 2002, serving as a Deputy of the Ternopil Regional Council of the 4th convocation and as a member of the Buchach Raion Council, where he contributed to the permanent commission on agro-industrial complex and land relations. However, his political journey faced a shift in the fall of 2015 when he was expelled from the Agrarian Party of Ukraine. Undeterred, he registered as a candidate from the Petro Poroshenko Bloc in constituency No. 10 during the elections to the Ternopil Regional Council. Due to health concern on 28 November 2019, he announced his reignation as people's deputy.\nBeyond politics, Gadz is also involved in public service as a member of the supervisory board of Ivan Horbachevsky Ternopil National Medical University, demonstrating his commitment to various spheres of community development. He assumed the presidency of FC Kolos Buchach on 21 August 2005, and holds significant positions within regional agricultural associations and unions. At the assembly hall of his agricultural firm Buchachagrokhlibprom in 2022, nominal certificates were given to the top tenth grade pupils from Trybukhivtsi, Zolotopotitska, and Buchach Raion villages.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n\n=== Political Ties and State Subsidies ===\nIn September 2017, members of the Ternopil Regional Council and people's deputies visited Gadz after their forced relocation to the Petro Poroshenko Bloc. Discussions during the Verkhovna Rada meeting focused on land relations and agrarian policy in Buchach, with him securing funding for his agricultural company during Petro Poroshenko's visit. Journalists uncovered that businesses associated with their assistants or members of the Verkhovna Rada's agriculture committee were the primary recipients of budget subsidies, leading to his company, LLC Buchachagrokhlibprom, receiving approximately 14 million in state support in 2019, facilitated by the assistance of Mykola Liushniak.\n\n\n=== Allegations of Pollution ===\nHis nomination as chairman of the Ternopil Regional Council's permanent committee on environmental protection and natural management in 2020 was prompted by the outcry. After all, the person responsible for its destruction was chosen to save the environment. In late September 2020, a scandal erupted as it was revealed that Farm GADZ had been dumping sewage into a reservoir between the villages of Sokolivka and Zolotyi Potik, leading to widespread contamination and fish die-offs. Prompted by public outrage, environmental inspection authorities and the police responded by collecting samples for examination and investigating the incident, with locals attributing the recurring environmental disasters to sewage discharge from his dairy complex of Buchagrokhlibprom.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nGadz is married to Maria Pavlovna Gadz, and together they have a daughter.\n\n\n== Awards and recognitions ==\nWith the granting of the Order of the State for exceptional personal contributions to the Ukraine in the expansion of agricultural output, the introduction of cutting-edge technology and contemporary forms of management, and many years of selfless effort, he was named the Hero of Ukraine. Oleksii Reznikov, the minister of defense, gave the recognition on 9 July 2023, for his individual and professional contributions to the nation's farmers' victory.\nGadz has received awards and recognitions such as:\n\n Hero of Ukraine Order of the State (24 August 2012)\n 20 Years of Independence of Ukraine Medal (27 June 2012)\nHonored Worker of Agriculture of Ukraine (26 June 2008)\nDistinction of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine Medal (9 July 2023)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Thrigmopoeus truculentus is a species of Indian tarantula found in the Western Ghats. It is also known as the Karwar large burrowing spider, Karwar burrowing spider and lesser Goa mustard tarantula.\n\n\n== Range ==\nThrigmopoeus truculentus is endemic to the Western Ghats region, specifically Karnataka, Goa, Maharashtra. It has been recorded from vertical bunds along the roads and trek paths in Coorg as well as other locations in Goa, Maharashtra and Karnataka.\n\n\n== Habitat and ecology ==\n\nBurrows of Thrigmopoeus truculentus were found in 0.5-5m height from the ground in Coorg and Uttara Kannada districts. These bunds are usually covered with ferns and grasses in Monsoon and post-monsoon. The burrows are found on bunds with high canopy or in the ghat areas were direct sunlight was minimum. Only very few sightings of burrows without canopy was observed.  The entrances of burrows belonging to T. truculentus is often shaped like a trumpet-bell, the rim of which is consolidated with wet mud and spider silk. In some cases a porch like entrance is seen due to the extended dorsal rim of the burrow. Often the burrow entrance is reinforced with adjacent twigs, dry leaves and other such artifacts that prevents it from collapsing, as it also offers an extended passage during entry and exit for the inmate of the burrows. The embankments on which the burrows were dug by the spiders were predominantly covered with herbaceous flora, and in the monsoon season the microhabitat was covered in lush green vegetation which conspicuously decreased in post-monsoon.\n\n\n== Pet trade ==\nThrigmopoeus truculentus has much lesser demand in the pet trade market compared to other spiders, with buyers mainly from United Kingdom, US, Germany and Poland. With increasing demand for tarantulas as pets, there has been an exponential increase in illegal trade and captive breeding efforts. There are indications that locals are usually hired for collection, the spiders are then smuggled to breeders/collectors.\n\n\n== Threats ==\nThrigmopoeus truculentus is threatened by fragmentation, habitat degradation, soil erosion, developmental activities and pet trade. Habitat degradation is caused by the widening of roads where T. truculentus build it's burrows, cutting of trees, soil erosion, tourism and other such human infleuence and bund maintenance. T. truculentus origninally barely missed the vulnerable category as listed in the 2008 IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals, However, due to the continuing decline inferred in its area of occupancy, in the quality of habitat and population, T. truculentus has since been put in the Near-threatened species category.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Linganatha Thammiam Adisesh, usually known as L. T. Adisesh (11 May 1927 – 19 November 2016), was an Indian cricketer who played first-class cricket from 1947 to 1956. He became a doctor and practised in England.\nAdisesh was a middle-order batsman and all-rounder. While studying medicine at the University of Mysore he represented the university in the Rohinton Baria Trophy, scoring 185 when Mysore won the final in 1950–51. He played in the Ranji Trophy for Mysore from 1947 to 1956, and also played for South Zone in first-class matches against international touring teams. \nIn 1951–52 Adisesh had his most successful match, scoring 70 and 183 and taking 4 for 33 in the first innings when Mysore defeated Hyderabad by 422 runs in the Ranji Trophy. A few weeks later he top-scored for South Zone against the touring MCC, scoring 69 and 29. \nIn 1952–53 Adisesh again top-scored for South Zone, this time against the touring Pakistan team, scoring 87. Shortly afterwards, he was selected to tour the West Indies in 1952–53 with the Indian Test team, but was one of several selected players from South Zone who made themselves unavailable in protest at what they believed was a West Zone bias among the selectors.\nAdisesh continued his medical studies in England. He played league cricket in northern England, including a spell with Liverpool in the Liverpool and District Cricket Competition from 1966 to 1973. He practised medicine in Liverpool, and died at home there in November 2016, aged 89.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nL. T. Adisesh at ESPNcricinfo",

        "content": "\"The Chance of Love\" (Korean: 운명, Unmyeong; Japanese: 運命, Unmei, lit. \"Fate\") is a song recorded by South Korean duo TVXQ. It was released through SM Entertainment on March 28, 2018, as the lead single from their eighth studio album New Chapter No. 1: The Chance of Love (2018). It was the duo's first Korean single after serving two years in the Republic of Korea Armed Forces from 2015 to 2017.\nWritten and produced by their longtime collaborator Yoo Young-jin, \"The Chance of Love\" is an electro swing pop song with R&B elements, similar to TVXQ's previous single \"Something\" (2014). The lyrics focus on the feelings of love at first sight and destiny. The accompanying music video was released on the day of the album's release.\n\"The Chance of Love\" was re-recorded to Japanese and released as a track on the duo's ninth Japanese album Tomorrow (2018).\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nOn August 21, 2017, three days after Max Changmin's discharge from the Korean army, TVXQ held a press conference announcing their official comeback. They stated that they had already started working on new material for an upcoming album, which they recorded during breaks from their military services. New Chapter No. 1: The Chance of Love, the first of a duology, was announced on March 16, 2018. The first two music video teasers for \"The Chance of Love,\" featuring U-Know Yunho and Changmin separately, were released on March 23. The music video teaser was released on March 24, confirming the song to be the album's lead single. It was formally released on March 28, 2018, alongside the album.\n\"The Chance of Love\", written by TVXQ's longtime collaborator Yoo Young-jin is described as a \"electro swing\" R&B song by Billboard and a \"swing jazz\" dance song by The Korea Herald. The success of TVXQ's previous jazz-fusion song \"Something\" (2014) has inspired TVXQ to pursue a similar \"musical-like\" performance number as their lead single. Despite comparisons to \"Something\", Yunho described \"The Chance of Love\" as more catchy and sophisticated, with a sense of maturity that represents TVXQ's standing as 15-year K-pop veterans. He also stated, \"The song’s addictive hook is the focal point. Even if you listen to it ever so slightly, the song is attractive enough to capture your ears.\"\nVeering from the duo's previous works that centered on explosive performances with aggressive lyrics, \"The Chance of Love\" is a song that centers on love at first sight, while also sending a message that TVXQ are \"destined\" or \"fated\" to be with each other and their fans.\n\"The Chance of Love\" debuted at number 36 on the Gaon \nDigital Chart, and peaked at number 30. The music video was directed by Rigend Film.\n\n\n== Promotion ==\nTVXQ debuted their performance of \"The Chance of Love\" on Mnet's music program M Countdown on March 29, 2018, followed by KBS's Music Bank on March 30, MBC's Show! Music Core on March 31, and SBS's Inkigayo on April 1. They promoted the song again for a second time two weeks later on the same music programs, from April 12 to 15.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Credits ==\nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes.\nStudio\n\nSM Booming System – recording, digital editing, engineered for mix, mixing\nSonic Korea – mastering\nPersonnel\n\nSM Entertainment – executive producer\nLee Soo-man – producer\nTVXQ – vocals\nYoo Young-jin – producer, lyrics, composition, arrangement, vocal directing, background vocals, recording, digital editing, engineered for mix, mixing, music and sound supervisor\nJihad Rahmouni – producer, composition, arrangement\nLorenzo Fragola – composition, arrangement\nHaris Alagic – producer, composition, arrangement\nJeon Hoon – mastering\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial teaser video for \"The Chance of Love\" (U-Know Yunho version) on YouTube\nOfficial teaser video for \"The Chance of Love\" (Max Changmin version) on YouTube\nOfficial teaser video for \"The Chance of Love\" on YouTube\nOfficial video for \"The Chance of Love\" on YouTube",

        "content": "John Snarey is a psychologist, academic, and author. He is a Senior Research Psychologist and the Franklin N. Parker Professor Emeritus in the Candler School of Theology and the Laney Graduate Department of Psychology at Emory University.\nSnarey is most known for his work in the social scientific study of human development, having done pioneering research on lifespan psychosocial development and generativity, on morality, moral development, and moral education, and the psychology of religion and faith development. He has authored and co-authored research papers and books such as Race-ing Moral Formation, How Fathers Care for The Next Generation, and Conflict and Continuity. Additionally, he is the recipient of the 1988 AERA Outstanding Human Development Research Award, the James Moran Award for Exceptional Research in Family Relations and Child Development from the American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences (AAFCS) in 1994, the 2003 GSU Marie C. Keel Award for Excellence in Mentoring in Educational Psychology, the 2007 Albert E. Levy Scientific Research Award from Emory University and the Association for Moral Education Kuhmerker Career Award in 2014.\nSnarey is a Fellow of the American Psychological Association (APA) and the American Educational Research Association (AERA). He was a Founding Cohort Member of the William James Society and has been a member of the William James Studies Editorial Board since 2005.\n\n\n== Education and early career ==\nSnarey earned a B.S. in Education with a concentration in Psychology from Geneva College in 1969 and an M.A. in Religion and Culture in 1973 from Wheaton College, where he became an instructor in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology in 1974. Between 1975 and 1981, he worked as a Teaching Fellow at Harvard College and the Harvard Graduate School of Education, where he obtained an Ed.D. in Human Development and Psychology in 1982 and was awarded the Exemplary Dissertation Award from the National Council for the Social Studies and the Kuhmerker Dissertation Award from the Association for Moral Education. From 1982 to 1984, he completed a Postdoctoral Clinical Research Fellowship in Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSnarey held positions as a Research Associate at Harvard's Graduate School of Education and an Associate Research Psychologist at Wellesley College until 1985; he then served as an associate professor of Human Development and Education at Northwestern University until 1987, when he joined Emory University as an associate professor of Human Development and Ethics. He was promoted to full Professor in 1995 and was awarded a named chair, the Franklin N. Parker Professor of Human Development and Ethics, in 2014. He has been serving as Senior Research Psychologist and the Franklin N. Parker Professor Emeritus since 2023.\nSnarey was the Chair of the Department of Theology and Personality from 1994 to 1996 and subsequently assumed the role of Director of the Honors and Thesis Programs until 2001. In 2001, he was elected as the Chair of the Emory University Faculty Council and President of the Emory University Senate until 2005, concurrently working as the Director of the Moral Cognition, Development, and Education Lab from 2004 to 2015.\n\n\n== Research ==\nSnarey has contributed to the field of psychology by studying psychosocial development across the life cycle, the psychology of moral development and decision-making, and the psychology of religious and nonreligious faith development, using longitudinal, cross-cultural, and neuroimaging methods.\n\n\n=== Psychology of the human life cycle ===\nSnarey has studied the psychology of the human life cycle throughout his career. In the book How Fathers Care for The Next Generation: A Four-Decade Study, he analyzed the role of fathers in children's development over four decades and generations, emphasizing social-emotional, intellectual-academic, and physical-athletic aspects, and defining characteristics of supportive paternal engagement. David Popenoe stated, \"For those who hold the view that fathers are superfluous, or for anyone who wants to read an extraordinarily rich discussion of the importance of fathering, this book is strongly recommended.\" He also investigated the coping strategies of married men facing infertility, finding that earlier coping methods predict later parenting resolutions and midlife achievement of psychosocial generativity.\nIn response to Nancy Snow's retelling of Clarence Darrow's negative take on parental generativity, Snarey concluded that both modeling and reworking processes influence the course of generativity. With Victoria Lasser, he examined how parent behavior influences ego development in adolescent girls during the transition to college, highlighting the importance of considering the dynamics within the father-daughter-mother triangle.\n\n\n=== Psychology of morality ===\nSnarey researched the psychology of morality by analyzing moral education, moral development, justice and care ethics, with a theoretical focus on Lawrence Kohlberg's theories. He reviewed cross-cultural research on moral reasoning, supporting Kohlberg's claim of universal moral development while noting biases and emphasizing the need for a developmental perspective on sociocultural systems. In addition, in 1987 and 1988, he contributed to a two-volume set, which presented the system of classifying moral judgment built up by Lawrence Kohlberg and his associates over a period of twenty years. Georg Lind commented, \"These volumes present an unprecedented methodology for understanding moral-cognitive development. Developmental, school and clinical psychologists will find it very useful.\"\nIn 2004, with Vanessa Siddle Walker, Snarey co-edited Race-ing Moral Formation: African American Perspectives on Care and Justice, which examined moral development and education within the African American community, challenging existing notions and offering insights to promote moral reasoning and justice in schools. In a review for the Journal of the American Educational Studies Association, Sylvia Jones called it \"a splendid center for academic discourse on marginalization\". He also worked alongside colleagues, using fMRI to show that moral sensitivity, essential for ethical decisions, correlates with specific brain activations, differing for justice and care moral issues.\n\n\n=== Psychology of religion ===\nSnarey's work on the psychology of religion has focused on William James and his writings, especially the varieties of religious experiences, as well as on pragmatism, religious education, and faith development. Alongside Lynn Bridgers, he analyzed James' spiritual journey through his family history, emphasizing his father's conversion to Emmanuel Swedenborg's religious beliefs and how James' writing process contributed to his own moral and religious evolution. With Katie Givens Kime, he proposed applying James' perspective to address reductionism in neuropsychological studies of religion, advocating interdisciplinary collaboration among neuroscientists, scholars, and psychosocial scientists. Additionally, he and Joel McLendon analyzed William James's Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh to understand them as separate performances, using first-hand accounts and a word-count method to illuminate James's perspectives and experiences during each lecture.\nSnarey's empirical studies of religion also used cross-cultural research methods. His cross-cultural study of faith development, as conceptualized by James Fowler, focused on the faith of Jewish non-theists in Israel and the United States, discovering tentative support for the legitimacy of Fowler's faith development model, and establishing that the construct validity of Fowler's model and measure was adequate for research purposes.\nSnarey's study of religious ethics in 186 societies paired the ideas of William James with those of sociologist Max Weber, revealing that environmental water scarcity predicted beliefs in a morally concerned supreme deity.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n1988 – Outstanding Human Development Research Award, American Educational Research Association (AERA)\n1994 – James Moran Award for Exceptional Research in Family Relations and Child Development, American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences (AAFCS)\n2003 – Marie C.

It is a concrete building that was built in the late 1960s for refueling ships and submarines.\nThe name Kuuli Muna refers to Oskar Kuul, the chairman of the Kirov Collective Fishing Farm, which owned property in the area. Currently, Reidikai is abandoned, used by divers, and used for picnics by the sea. The water depth around Reidikai is 10 to 13 meters (33 to 43 ft). From Reidikai, pipelines on the seabed lead to the Viimsi oil storage facility.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Reidikai at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Alinaq Noyan (–1289) was a commander of the Il-Khanate and a Commander of Georgia. He was the son-in-law of the Il-Khanid ruler Tekuder. He may have been a son of Tügür Bitigchi, a commander of Hulegu.\nAlinaq led a military campaign on his behalf against Tekuder's rival Arghun. Arghun left for Khorasan in spring to gain the allegiance of minor nobles and amirs. Tekuder on the other hand began to be suspicious of his half-brother Qonqurtai and Arghun's potential alliance. Qonqurtai was accused of conspiracy and was arrested by Tekuder's son-in-law, Alinaq Noyan - the viceroy of Georgia - on 17 January 1284, and was executed the next day. An army contingent was sent to Jazira, from where Gaykhatu and Baydu fled to Khorasan, to Arghun's encampment while several emirs such as Taghachar and Doladai were arrested.\nTekuder's next step was to send Alinaq with 15,000 men against Arghun, while he himself followed Alinaq on 26 April with his main army composed of Armenians and Georgians in addition to Mongols stationed in Mughan plain near Bilasuvar. Arghun prevailed against Alinaq in battle on 4 May, south of Qazvin, but nevertheless retreated to his lands in Khorasan. Ala ud-Daula Simnani, future Sufi saint of Kubrawiya order also fought in Arghun's army during this battle. Arghun tried negotiate a truce, which Ahmad, against the advice of his councillors, refused. Another embassy sent by Arghun, this time led by his son Ghazan arrived at Tekuder's camp near Semnan on 31 May. The embassy was a success, as Ahmad accepted a truce on the condition that Arghun send his brother Gaykhatu as a hostage. Arghun agreed to the terms and sent his brother accompanied by two amirs, including Nawruz into the custody of Buqa, then the most senior of Tekuder's commanders, on 13 or 28 June. Buqa in turn handed him over to Ahmad who put Gaykhatu in Tödai Khatun's encampment.\nDespite this, Tekuder continued hostilities and continued to advance on Arghun. This caused Buqa to harbour resentment towards Tekuder and to grow more sympathetic to Arghun. On the other hand, he lost the favour of Tekuder who started to invest his trust in Aq Buqa, another Jalair general.\nArghun's next step was to seek refuge in Kalat-e Naderi, a strong fortress on 7 July with 100 men. But he was forced to surrender to Alinaq four days later. Victorious, Tekuder left Arghun in Alinaq's custody while he himself left for Kalpush, where his main army was stationed. This was the opportunity Buqa was seeking - he broke into Alinaq's camp and set Arghun free, while killing Alinaq. Tekuder fled west and looted Buqa's encampment near Sultaniya in revenge. He continued on to his own pasturelands near Takht-i Suleyman on 17 July planning to escape to the Golden Horde via Derbent. However, Qaraunas, who had been sent by Buqa, soon caught up with and arrested Tekuder. He was turned over to Arghun on 26 July on the Ab-i Shur pasturelands, near Maragha.\nAlinaq was succeeded in this position by his son Qurumushi.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nHope, Michael (22 September 2016).

        "content": "Kiri Marie Nathan  (born 1972) is a New Zealand Māori fashion designer, entrepreneur, cultural ambassador and mentor, based in Auckland. She is co-founder of the fashion brand Kiri Nathan, was the first Māori designer to open New Zealand Fashion Week, and was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to Māori and the fashion industry.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nNathan was born in New Zealand in 1972. Her iwi are Ngāpuhi, Ngāti Hine, Ngāti Hauā, Ngāti Maru and Ngāti Paoa. She spent her early childhood living and going to school between Scotland and New Zealand. At about age 10, her family settled in Glen Innes, Auckland. When her parents divorced, she lived with her grandmother, seamstress Inez Fullerton, in St Heliers, who taught her how to sew. Nathan's grandmother, and mother, Rozelle Fullerton, both made their own clothes.\nNathan was introduced to the fashion industry by designer Kim Fraser who was her mentor after high school, and tutor when Nathan did her three-year diploma in visual arts at the Manukau Institute of Technology, majoring in fashion. At age 18, Nathan became a single mother while she continued to study. Her tutors failed a black silk dress she designed that incorporated Māori design in woven braid trims. Nathan entered the design in the New Zealand Creative Youth Awards and won the Womenswear section, as well as the Overall Supreme Award.\nAfter graduating, Nathan learned traditional and contemporary Māori weaving and became a flight attendant and then an in-flight manager for Ansett and Air New Zealand for 14 years. She met her husband Jason Te Ahu Renata Nathan (Ngāpuhi and Ngāti Whātua) and his child in 1998. They married and had three more children. While working at Air New Zealand, Nathan entered various fashion competitions including the New Zealand Wearable Art Awards. In 2008, she won the Supreme Award at Style Pasifika. Winning the major prize, she and her husband had the confidence to start their own label.\n\n\n== Work ==\nNathan started her Kiri Nathan high-end fashion label in 2010, and she and her husband launched their first collections in 2012.\nNathan's distinctive garments, jewellery, and pounamu designed by husband Jason Nathan, bring together Māori culture, tradition, and contemporary designs. Nathan uses traditional raranga (weaving) techniques to create kākahu (handwoven garments and cloaks) and applications to garments. Each year she creates seven ongoing trans-seasonal collections based on wahanga o te ao Māori (components of Māori life). Her clothes acknowledge Māori whakapapa (genealogy), use sustainable materials and are ethically sourced and manufactured. Kiri Nathan pieces have been worn by Barack and Michelle Obama, the Duchess of Sussex, Beyoncé, Demi Lovato, Ed Sheeran and Mariah Carey and owned by Bruce Springsteen and Will.i.am.\nIn 2017, Nathan founded the Kāhui Collective, a community to support emerging Māori and indigenous fashion designers in their businesses and creative endeavours. The Kāhui Collective is one part of the ecosystem Nathan is building, called KAURI, designed to be the first commercial Māori fashion industry. From 2017 to 2022, Nathan led several trade visits to China to support groups of Māori fashion designers.\nIn 2020, Nathan dressed Jojo Rabbit producer Chelsea Winstanley in a handwoven gown for the Oscars red carpet when she was the first indigenous producer nominated for best picture.\nIn 2022, Nathan moved her business from her small Auckland home and studio, into her showroom, creative workshop and operations hub called Te Āhuru Mōwai, meaning shelter or safe haven, in Glen Innes. The working space is where Nathan makes her clothing and woven kākahu, and it is also a community hub for future of Aotearoa fashion designers to be mentored. In 2023, the Kahui Collective sold its designs at a pop-up store at Te Ahuru Mōwai.\n\nIn 2022, Prime Minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, wore a kākahu to show her support for Māori at the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II.\nIn 2023 Nathan was the first Māori designer to open New Zealand Fashion Week in its 22-year history, with a spectacular runway show telling the story of the evolution of Māori garments and culture. Instead of creating one collection, as is usual, Nathan created six. Instead of photographing 30 garments for their lookbook, they shot 130. Te Pāti Māori (Māori Party) co-leader Rawiri Waititi MP, modelled a pounamu tie on the runway, referring to him being dismissed from parliament for not wearing a western tie. Vogue Australia described the milestone show as “the changing of the guard” in New Zealand fashion.\nIn addition to New Zealand Fashion Week, Nathan has shown at Guangzhou Fashion Week China, Fiji Fashion Week and Kiri Nathan was the first New Zealand label to be selected for the London Fashion Week international showcase by the British Council and the British Fashion Council. Nathan has won numerous fashion competitions and Kiri Nathan was the first New Zealand fashion label to work with Walt Disney Pictures for the red carpet of Moana. Handwoven Kiri Nathan kākahu are in the Walt Disney museum, the Auckland Museum and will be used to cloak women in all future New Zealand Monarchy dame investiture ceremonies. Te Papa Tongarewa, the Museum of New Zealand, has 13 Kiri Nathan pieces in its New Zealand National Collection.\nNathan serves on the board of the WOW World of Wearable Arts, the advisory board for New Zealand Fashion Week, the New Zealand China Council board, the New Zealand Mindful Fashion board, the advisory board for Super Diverse Woman and is a founding board member of the I have a Dream charitable trust that helps disadvantaged children achieve academic success. She is a founding member of Wāhine Toa, identifying and mentoring leadership in young Māori women.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\n\nIn 2019, Nathan was named the MWDI (Māori Women's Development Incorporated) Māori Business Woman of the Year, and also received a Blake Leader award the same year.\nIn the 2020 Queen's Birthday Honours, Nathan was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to Māori and the fashion industry. The same year, she was the first Māori finalist for SheEO NZ.\nIn 2021, Nathan was inducted into the New Zealand Hall of Fame for Women Entrepreneurs.\nIn 2024, Nathan was one of three finalists for New Zealander of the Year in the New Zealander of the Year Awards.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nNathan lives in Mount Wellington, Auckland with her husband and business partner, Jason Te Ahu Renata Nathan, who is the master carver behind the Kiri Nathan brand's notable pounamu designs. They have five children and four grandchildren.\nIn 2021, Nathan completed an intensive 36-week full-immersion te reo Māori language programme.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of New Zealand designers and artisans\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Pieris balcana, the Balkan green-veined white, is a species of butterfly within the family Pieridae. The species has white upper wings with darkened apex tips. Females contain 2 dark spots on the forewing whereas males only contain 1 that are sometimes absent. The underside of the wings is yellowish with gray scales running along the veines of the wings. The species can be differentiated from the similar Pieris napi from the underside wing gray scales being more spread out and faded, compared to the scales of P. napi being more sharply defined.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nPieris balcana occurs in Balkans in regions from Croatia to southwestern Bulgaria and central Greece at elevations up to 1,300 meters. The species inhabits vegitated areas alongside hedges and edges of woodland and woodland clearings. Forest habitats the species inhabits include broadleaf deciduous forests, coniferous woodlands, and mixed woodlands. Eggs are laid on various Brassicaceae members which the larvae feed on, where the adult generations then occur from March to October.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nPieris balcana has been assessed as a 'Least concern' species by the IUCN Red List in 2009 due to it having a large occurrence and population size of more than 10,000 adult individuals with no decline in populations of more than 25% in the previous 10 years. It also occurs in a number of protected areas across its range.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The System is a villainous professional wrestling stable performing in the American promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). The group consists of members Brian Myers, Eddie Edwards, Edwards' wife Alisha, and Moose. Moose is the current TNA World Champion, while Myers and Edwards are the current TNA World Tag Team Champions.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn the June 15, 2023 episode of Impact!, Myers approached Moose to offer to team with him against Impact World Tag Team Champions ABC (Ace Austin and Chris Bey). On July 15, at Slammiversary, Myers and Moose was involved in the Impact World Tag Team Championship four-way tag team match, which was won by Subculture (Mark Andrews and Flash Morgan Webster). On the August 8 episode of Impact!, Myers unsuccessfully challenged for the Impact World Championship against Alex Shelley. On August 27, at Emergence, Myers teamed with Moose, Bully Ray and Lio Rush defeating Josh Alexander and Time Machine (Alex Shelley, Chris Sabin and Kushida). On December 9, at Final Resolution, Myers teamed up with Eddie Edwards to unsuccessfully challenge ABC for the Impact World Tag Team Championship.\n\n\n== History ==\nOn January 13, 2024, at the \"Countdown to TNA Hard To Kill\", Myers and Edwards defeated Eric Young and Frankie Kazarian pre-show. During a backstage interview at Hard To Kill, Edwards, Myers, Alisha Edwards, Moose and DeAngelo Williams would form a stable calling themselves \"The System\". The stable later accompanied Moose to his main event match for the TNA World Championship against Alex Shelley. During the match, Edwards and the rest of The System attempted to distract Shelley, prompting a brawl with Shelley's partners, Chris Sabin and Kushida. Moose later won the match, after which he was confronted by Nic Nemeth. On February 23, at the \"Countdown to No Surrender\", Myers and Edwards defeated Intergalactic Jet Setters (Kevin Knight and Kushida). On March 8, at Sacrifice, Myers and Edwards defeated ABC to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship, while Moose successfully defended his TNA world title against Eric Young.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n== Championships and accomplishments ==\nTotal Nonstop Action Wrestling\nTNA World Championship (1 time, current) – Moose\nTNA World Tag Team Championship (1 time, current) – Myers and Edwards\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Thyreosaurus is an extinct genus of stegosaurian dinosaur from the Middle Jurassic El Mers III Formation of Morocco. The genus contains a single species, Thyreosaurus atlasicus, known form a partial disarticulated partial skeleton consisting of several dorsal vertebrae, ribs, a limb bone, and dermal bones. Thyreosaurus is characterized by a unique dermal armor with an asymmetrical texture, indicating that it may have been recumbent. Alongside Adratiklit, Thyreosaurus increases the diversity of unique stegosaurs occurring in the Middle Jurassic of Africa.\n\n\n== Discovery and naming ==\n\nThe Thyreosaurus holotype specimen, HIIUC-BN00, was discovered in 2021 in sediments of the El Mers III Formation (El Mers Group, Boulahfa North locality) near Boulemane in the Middle Atlas mountains of Morocco. The specimen—which is associated but disarticulated—consists of nine dorsal vertebrae, 21 fragmentary ribs, a limb bone tentatively described as a fibula, and six osteoderms.\nThe fossil material was first reported in several conference abstracts in 2022 and 2023 before its formal description.\nIn 2024, Zafaty et al. described Thyreosaurus atlasicus as a new genus and species of stegosaurian dinosaur based on these fossil remains. The generic name, Thyreosaurus, combines thyreos (θυρεός), the name of an oblong shield used in Ancient Greece—referencing the specimen's unusual osteoderms—with the Greek σαῦρος (sauros), meaning \"lizard\". The specific name, atlasicus, refers to the Atlas Mountains of Morocco.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe holotype of Thyreosaurus belonged to an adult individual with an estimated body length of 6 metres (20 ft), but it was not fully grown. It possessed unique dermal armor that has been compared to that of nodosaurid ankylosaurs, consisting of asymmetrically sided oblong plates that were likely arranged recumbent on the back of the animal, instead of being held erect as in other stegosaurs.\n\n\n== Classification ==\nIn their phylogenetic analysis, Zafaty et al. (2024) recovered Thyreosaurus as dacentrurine member of the Stegosauridae, as the sister taxon to Dacentrurus. These species are in turn sister to Adratiklit, a contemporary of Thyreosaurus. Their results are displayed in the cladogram below:\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ryan Strnad (born September 17, 1971) is a beer vendor at American Family Field who created the political action committee Drinks In The Seats.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nStrnad was born in Oklahoma City, and after briefly living there and in rural Pennsylvania, he was raised in Muskego, Wisconsin, for most of his childhood life and graduated from Muskego High School. He served active duty in the United States Army as a cavalry scout from 1994 to 1997 achieving the rank as an E-4 specialist. When he returned to the Milwaukee, Wisconsin, suburbs as a civilian, Strnad attended Milwaukee Area Technical College receiving an associate degree in police science.\n\n\n== Career and running for office ==\nStrnad has been employed by Delaware North Companies as an in-seat vendor at home baseball games of the Milwaukee Brewers since 1988. While first working at Milwaukee County Stadium, he started selling food items and briefly supervised. In 1998, he became an in-seat beer vendor where he is currently. In addition to working various events including the opening of Miller Park, he has since gotten politically involved with the union Workers United being a union steward and serving on the union's bargaining committee at the stadium. In 2017, as a union steward, and in response to expanded competition from the concession stands in the nearby concourses at the stadium, Strnad started Drinks In The Seats and became a lobbyist to defend the jobs of in-seat beer vendors at the legislative level, as a result, he gave up his position as union steward in the process.\n\n\n=== State Assembly race ===\nIn 2000, and while a resident of Oak Creek,Wisconsin, Strnad ran as a Republican for the Wisconsin State Assembly in the 21st District where he lost to incumbent Jeffrey Plale.

        "content": "Yasuhisa Hara (Japanese: 原 泰久, Hepburn: Yasuhisa Hara, born June 9, 1975) is a Japanese manga artist and the creator of the series Kingdom.  \nWith more than 100 million tankōbon copies in circulation worldwide, Kingdom is one of the best-selling mangas in history. In 2013, Hara won the Grand Prize of the 17th Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize for his work on Kingdom. \n\n\n== Early life ==\nHara was born in the town of Kiyama in Saga Prefecture and attended Tomeikan High School. He would later be appointed first ambassador of his hometown.\nHara then enrolled at Kyushu Institute of Design where he graduated with a Bachelor's degree in 1998 and a Master's degree in 2000. He enrolled at the university with the intention of becoming a film director but learnt it was difficult to make a living in the film industry. In this third year at university, he decided to become a manga artist because he could do everything by himself such as directing, writing scripts and drawing.\nDuring his time at university, Hara had drawn a lot of storyboards but never drawn manga.  In 1997, he submitted his first work, Ueda-kun's Theory of Degeneration which won the Anticipation Award in the 36th edition of Young Magazine's Tetsuya Chiba Awards. In 1999, his work Ousamatsu won the runner-up grand prize at the 40th Tetsuya Chiba Awards He was assigned to an editor at Young Magazine where several of his one-shot stories were published but were never brought up at serialization meetings. At that point Hara gave up becoming a manga artist.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 2000, Hara took a job at Fujitsu as a systems engineer where he worked for three years.  During his time there, he gained experience on how teams worked as well as the difficulties encountered such as when his senior left the company and had to cover for him. He ended up losing money for the company but his bosses and seniors protected him. According to Hara, his time working there was crucial to developing Kingdom.\nIn 2003, Hara won the Encouragement Award at the 23rd Young Jump MANGA Grand Prix for his one-shot manga, Ha to Sen.\nIn 2005, Hara joined Weekly Young Jump as a manga artist to create the series, Kingdom. For several months he worked as an assistant to Takehiko Inoue which according to Hara was a very valuable experience.\nIn 2006, Kingdom started serializing in Weekly Young Jump. Initially the series struggled to gain popularity and was at the risk of getting cancelled. Hara asked Inoue for advice to which Inoue stated \"The story is interesting, it's just that Shin's eyes are too small\". With only a few words from Inoue, Hara realized that his work up to then had more emphasis on story rather than illustrations and adjusted the art style of Kingdom.\nIn 2012, Kingdom became the Guinness World Record Holder for the \"Manga Written by the Most People.\" A total of 1,087 people participated in the campaign to redraw the 26th volume of Kingdom. Notable mangaka who participated included Inoue, Eiichiro Oda, Masashi Kishimoto and Hirohiko Araki.\nIn 2013, Hara won the Grand Prize of the 17th Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize for his work on Kingdom.\nIn November 2023, with the release of its 70th volume, Kingdom surpassed 100 million copies printed.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHara was married in 2006 and has three children. In August 2020, Ruriko Kojima said on a radio show that she was currently in a relationship with Hara.   In September 2020, he released a statement on Twitter confirming he had divorced in March that year and that he had committed adultery. In July 2021, Kojima revealed they had broken up.\nOn August 15, 2019, Hara attended a roundtable discussion with Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. He revealed he had been following the show since its fourth season. In the 2019 live action film of Kingdom, Hara insisted that Chengjiao draw inspiration from Joffrey Baratheon.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n1997: Anticipation Award for Ueda-kun's Theory of Degeneration at 36th Tetsuya Chiba Awards\n1999: Runner-up grand prize for Ousamatsu at 40th Tetsuya Chiba Awards\n2003: Encouragement Award for Ha to Sen at the 23rd Young Jump MANGA Grand Prix\n2013: Grand prize for Kingdom at the 17th Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize\n2017: Grand prize for Kingdom at the 1st Tsutaya Comic Awards\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n=== Manga ===\n\n\n==== One-shot ====\nOtomatsu (1999)\nSenshiki (2001)\n\n\n==== Kingdom ====\nKingdom (2006–present)\nKingdom Highlights Volume 1 (2012)\nKongo (2003)\nHorse and Liquor for 300 Soldiers (2004)\nKingdom Highlights Volume 2 (2012)\nLi Mu (2004)\nMeng Wu and Chu Zi (2005)\n\n\n=== Animated works ===\nKingdom (2012–present)\n\n\n=== Live action films ===\nKingdom (2019)  – screenplay\nKingdom 2: Far and Away (2022) – screenplay\n\n\n== See also ==\n Anime and manga portal\n Biography portal\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nYasuhisa Hara  at Anime News Network's encyclopedia",

The album was announced on March 2024 and was confirmed to be the reunion of \"the Avengers\", which consists of Dímelo Flow, Sech, Dalex, Justin Quiles, Lenny Tavárez, and Feid. Although, Feid would not appear on any track off the album by release, with some questioning his absence.\nLike the previous album, The Academy (2019), the album's concept is inspired by the Avengers.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Queen of Kosala (Sanskrit: करणस्य राज्ञी) is a title used since the 11000 BCE by the wife of the King of Kosala. This term is often only used for the role of a queen consort (wife of the king). The earliest records show the first holder of the title being queens Keshini and Sumatithe wife of king Sagara, while Mallika of Kosala was believed to be the final holder of the title. However Sita is most famously known for holding this title while her husband Rama was king of Kosala.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThis title is more often given to the queen consort of the kingdom while their husbands are the supreme head of the kingdom. Once the king passes away due to circumstances the queen in this title will immediately lose the title as Queen of Kosala and will be known as the Widow queen.\n\n\n== Spouse of the Kings of Kosala ==\nThe first title holder is recorded to be queen Idhumiti and the final holder being Mallika of Kosala the spouse of king Pasenadi.\nWhile king Dasharatha was king he made his three wives Kaushalya, Kaikeyi and Sumitra queens of Kosala and all three were given the title.\nWhile Sita was in exile for 14 years with her husband, Mandavi's husband Bharata was the acting king of Kosala hence making Mandavi the acting queen for 14 years till the Coronation of Rama and Sita.\n\n\n=== List ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nCoronation of Rama and Sita\nKosala Kingdom\n\n\n== Notes ==",

        "content": "Rawnaq Naderi also known as Sayed Nooruddin Rawnaq Naderi (born 1940 in the valley of Kayan, Dushi district, Baghlan Province, Afghanistan) was a distinguished Afghan poet whose works have contributed significantly to Persian literature. As the son of Sayed Kayan, a prominent religious leader of the Afghanistan Ismailis, Naderi's upbringing was deeply influenced by a rich cultural and religious environment. \n\n\n== Biography ==\nNaderi was born into a family renowned for its devout Islamic faith and cultural patronage, with his father, Sayed Kayan, being a well-respected figure among the Afghanistan Ismailis. This heritage played a crucial role in shaping Naderi's perspectives and thematic focus in his literary works. He spent several years in jail along with his other four brothers and eventually he and 2 of his brothers were executed by the totalitarian regime of Hafizullah Amin in 1979 and two others survived. After his death, his elder brother Sayed Mansur Naderi, got out of jail and formed a strong military alliance to defend Ismaili interest in Afghanistan.\n\n\n== Advocacy through Verse: Poetic Contribution to Human Rights and Democratic Values ==\nRawnaq Naderi's body of work stands as a compelling testament to his steadfast commitment to human rights and democratic values, articulated through the medium of poetry. His literary journey, marked by the publication of four significant works—\"Ghunchaha\" (\"The Buds\"), \"Khun e Del\" (\"The Heart’s Blood\"), \"Armaghan e Zindan\" (\"A Gift from Prison\"), and \"Tuhfae Share\" (\"The Poet’s Gift\")—delves deep into themes of love, loss, resilience, and the relentless pursuit of justice. These themes not only reflect Naderi's personal and collective experiences but also serve as a broader commentary on the socio-political landscape of his time.  \nThrough traditional poetic forms, Naderi voiced the struggles and aspirations of the Hazara community and the wider Afghan society, positioning his work as a critical bridge between cultural identity and literary expression. His verses resonate with calls for justice and equality, shedding light on the challenges faced by marginalized communities and advocating for their inclusion in the fabric of Afghan society.\nNaderi's poetry transcends personal narrative to address universal concerns about human dignity and democratic freedoms, making him a pivotal figure in Afghan literature. His contributions continue to inspire discussions on social justice and the power of literature as a tool for advocacy and change, underscoring the enduring relevance of his work in contemporary times.\n\nThe legacy of Rawnaq Naderi, enriched by his advocacy for human rights and democratic values, remains an essential part of Afghan cultural heritage. His work not only provides profound insights into the cultural and social issues of his era but also serves as a beacon of hope and resilience, advocating for a more inclusive and just society.\n\n\n== Voices and Sufferings of the Hazara people in Rawnaq Naderi's Poetry ==\nRawnaq Naderi's poetry deeply reflects the experiences of the Hazara people under difficult historical conditions. His work is significant for incorporating the Hazaragi dialect, bringing to light the unique culture and challenges faced by the Hazara community in Afghanistan. Despite his notable contributions, Naderi's poetry has not been widely recognized in modern Afghan literary studies, a fact that underscores a broader issue of representation for minority voices in the country's cultural narrative.\n\nNaderi's poetic legacy includes poignant expressions of social and political critiques, rendered through the lens of Hazara suffering and resilience. His efforts to document the Hazara plight, especially through poems written in Hazaragi, have provided valuable insights into the community's struggle against oppression. Scholars and literary critics emphasize the importance of Naderi's work in preserving Hazara cultural identity and history, advocating for a more inclusive approach to Afghan literature that acknowledges and celebrates diverse contributions.\n\nDr. Freba Farhat Saifi discusses the profound connection between Rawnaq Naderi's poetry and the societal challenges of his era in \"Social Rheumatism in Rawnaq Naderi's Poems.\" Naderi, who lived through a tumultuous political climate marked by oppression and turmoil, wielded his pen against the injustices inflicted by the rulers of his time. His works vividly portray the social unrest and the struggles for freedom and justice, making him a significant but underrecognized voice in Afghan literature. Through a descriptive-analytical research method, including discussions with Naderi's family, Dr. Saifi aims to reintroduce this poignant voice to literature enthusiasts, highlighting his relevance in today's society. Naderi's poetry, rich in social romanticism, serves as a mirror to the collective consciousness of a people yearning for change, capturing the essence of human and societal pain in the face of authoritarian regimes. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Arif Agha Mosque (Arabic: مسجد عارف آغا) later known as the Imam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal Mosque is a historic mosque located in the Rusafa area of Baghdad, Iraq. The mosque was built during the Ottoman period, and it contains a small mausoleum which is purported to be the burial place of Ahmad ibn Hanbal, the founder of the Hanbali school of thought.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe mosque is an Ottoman-period structure. It consists of a prayer hall, courtyard, and a small room topped by a dome which serves as a mausoleum. The total area of the mosque is around 300 square metres, and the mausoleum room cannot hold more than 30 visitors. Parts of the mosque are in disrepair and currently undergoing an extensive restoration.\n\n\n== Attribution of Ahmad ibn Hanbal's burial place ==\nIn 1937, the remains of Ahmad ibn Hanbal were supposedly transferred to the Arif Agha Mosque after the cemetery he was buried in was flooded by the Tigris. Later historians have doubted the story, saying that it is inaccurate and erroneous. Before this, a domed mausoleum had been built over the grave of Ahmad ibn Hanbal, but it was destroyed repeatedly.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mosques in Iraq\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Adolph Samelson (6 September 1817 – 12 January 1888) was a German Jewish ophthalmic surgeon.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSamelson was born to Jewish parents at Berlin on 6 September 1817. He was educated at the Berlin Gymnasium, the Winterhaus, and the Berlin Friedrich-Wilhelm Gymnasium, and finally at the university of Berlin, where he graduated M.D. in 1840. In the following year, he began to practice at Zehdenick in Brandenburg, where he played some part in politics as a staunch liberal, and became a member of the town council and the electoral colleges for the Prussian national assembly and the German reichstag. He was instrumental in the foundation of a friendly burial society and a co-operative loan society, and was an active contributor to ‘Die Neue Zeit,’ a local liberal newspaper which was started in 1849. For an article on the Dresden insurrection and the mode in which it was suppressed by the Prussian soldiers he was imprisoned for six months and deprived of his civil rights. After his release he resumed his professional duties at Zehdenick, but they were terminated by the withdrawal of his license to practice medicine. He afterwards went to Berlin, took up the study of diseases of the eye, and became the pupil and friend of Dr. von Graefe. The authorities eventually forced him to leave the country, and he went to Paris, with the intention of entering the medical service of the French army in the Crimea. He, however, fell ill during a cholera epidemic, and spent some time in Holland and Belgium. But he was prevented by official difficulties from following his profession there.\nIn the summer of 1856, he came to England and devoted himself chiefly to the study of the diseases of the eye. He took up his residence in Manchester in 1857, and from that time displayed the keenest interest in its social, sanitary, and educational progress. In 1859 the Prussian authorities restored his social status and his license to practise. His zealous public spirit and high character gained him many warm friends in Manchester, where he was one of the physicians of the Eye Hospital from 1862 to 1876, and joined in the management and support of the Schiller-Anstalt, the Sanitary Association, the Dramatic Reform Association (of which he was the treasurer and moving spirit), the Art Museum, the Provident Society, and other organisations. He was also a member of the Manchester Literary Club, and a frequent speaker at its meetings, where his knowledge of classical and modern literature and his critical acumen in discussion were much appreciated. In 1865 he went to Berlin to be treated by von Graefe for an affection of the eye called ‘granular lid,’ and afterwards published his ‘Reminiscences of a Four Months' Stay’ with that oculist, in which he gave to the English public the first account of his method of linear extraction of cataract. Samelson in 1867 translated von Graefe's essay on ‘The Study of Ophthalmology,’ and between 1860 and 1880 contributed many papers on ophthalmic science to various journals and societies.\nHis last years were attended by persistent insomnia, and he sought relief at Bournemouth, and then at Cannes, where he died on 12 January 1888. He was buried at the Protestant cemetery. By his will, he left the bulk of his property, valued at about 4,900l., to charitable and educational institutions.\nBesides professional papers, he wrote: \n\n‘The Altar at Pergamus and the Satyr from Pergamus: Papers read before the Manchester Literary Club,’ 1881.\n‘Dwellings and the Death-rate of Manchester,’ 1883.\n‘The Education of the Drama's Patrons,’ printed in ‘Social Science Association Transactions’ (1882) and ‘Journal of Dramatic Reform.’\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Sutton, Charles William (1897). \"Samelson, Adolph\".

He was the grandson of Valentine Sayer of Sandwich, who was thrice mayor of that town (information kindly given by Mr. Gerald Brenan). When twelve years of age Augustin travelled with his family in France, and was made a prisoner of war, but was soon permitted his liberty within certain limits, and is said to have supported himself as a tutor in a French school. He was, in after life, an excellent French scholar, a good classic, and an able mathematician. As soon as he was fully restored to liberty he commenced his medical studies in England. In the ‘Medical Directory’ it is stated that he graduated B.A. in 1811, and M.A. in 1813; at what university he took these degrees is unknown. After studying medicine for seven years, he entered, on 31 January 1815, as a student at Leyden, where, four days later, he graduated as doctor of medicine. It is said that he was afterwards an army surgeon. He was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians on 22 December 1820, and elected a fellow on 11 July 1843. He was a fellow of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society, and was elected president in 1840. He was a member of the Medical Society of London, and for some years took an active part in the proceedings of the Westminster Medical Society, of which he was president from 1830 to 1846. He was physician to H.R.H. the Duke of Kent, and honorary physician to Prince Frederick of the Netherlands. His chief public appointment was that of physician to the Lock Hospital and Asylum, which he held for many years. Through a long professional life he was an earnest advocate of sanitary reform, and for years he was a conspicuous member of the Marylebone representative council. He died at his residence in Upper Seymour Street, Portman Square, on 15 November 1861, aged 71. He bequeathed to the library of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society a copy of the ‘Dictionnaire de Science Médicale’ in sixty volumes.\nThe following were his chief works: \n\n‘Inquiry to ascertain the maximum Limit of the Annual Taxation required from the Sewers Ratepayers,’ 8vo, London, 1855.\n‘Metropolitan and Town Sewage: their Nature, Value, and Disposal,’ 8vo, London, 1857.\n‘London Main Drainage: the Nature, and Disposal of Sewage,’ 2nd ed. 8vo, 1858.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Webb, William Wilfrid (1897). \"Sayer, Augustin\".

        "content": "Rosanna Natoli is an Australian politician and former television presenter.\nShe is currently the mayor of the Sunshine Coast Region, having been elected at the 2024 Queensland local elections.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nIn December 2023, Natoli announced she would contest the 2024 Queensland local government elections as a mayoral candidate for the Sunshine Coast Regional Council, vying to be the successor of Mark Jamieson who had announced he would not be recontesting the position.\nNatoli achieved 27% of the primary vote, defeating her nearest rival Ashley Robinson on 24% and was subsequently elected as the new mayor of the Sunshine Coast Region.\nHer election resulted in Natoli becoming the first woman to be elected mayor of the Sunshine Coast Regional Council.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Seven Queensland ===\nNatoli is arguably best known for her lengthy tenure as a presenter for the Seven Network's regional network, Seven Queensland.\nNatoli commenced working for the network as a journalist, initially based in Bundaberg and then Maryborough before relocating to the Sunshine Coast where she has lived ever since.\nAlthough based on the Sunshine Coast, Natoli was seen throughout the state reading local Seven News updates for the various geographical areas of Queensland while also filling in for weather forecaster Livio Regano on the main 6pm bulletin in each market.\nNatoli was also a journalism lecturer at the University of the Sunshine Coast. \nNatoli took leave from both positions in the lead up to the 2024 Queensland local elections. After being declared the new mayor of the Sunshine Coast Regional Council on 29 March 2024, Natoli said she would formally resign from her positions at Seven Queensland and the University of the Sunshine Coast.\n\n\n=== Fake or fortune? ===\nIn 2017, Natoli and her husband Joe Natoli appeared on the BBC's Fake or Fortune? which investigated the authenticity of a Tom Roberts oil painting, entitled Rejected, which the Natoli's had purchased from an English auction website in 2013. The Natoli's initially believed the work to be genuine and had it estimated prior to auction at $30,000 before a Tom Roberts expert cast doubt on its authenticity. Thinking it was worthless, Natoli stored the painting in a cupboard until a friend suggested approaching Fake or Fortune?  At the conclusion of their investigation, art historian Mary Eagle concluded the work to be genuine.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nNatoli was born in Bundaberg, but grew up in Brisbane where she attended Aspley State High School. She was school captain and dux of the school. Some of her early employment experience includes working at clothing retailer Best & Less and the Sheraton Hotel.\nShe graduated from the University of Queensland with a Bachelor of Science majoring in psychology before receiving a Graduate Diploma in Communication – Journalism from the Queensland University of Technology.\nNatoli married her husband Joe Natoli in 1989, and has three children. Her husband is a councillor on the Sunshine Coast Regional Council, the same council which she now leads. This has led to some concerns around potential conflicts of interest, which both Natoli and her husband dismissed. In 2004, her husband became the final person to be elected as mayor of the Maroochy Shire Council prior to the council being merged into the new larger Sunshine Coast Regional Council which was formed as a result of the 2008 Queensland council amalgamations. Although he attempted to be elected as inaugural mayor of the new council, he was defeated by former Noosa Shire mayor Bob Abbot.\nNatoli has an interest in performing, beginning when she played the lead role in a school musical at Aspley State High School. In 2017, she played the Wicked Witch in a stage production of The Wizard of Oz.\nIn March 2022, Natoli was ranked at #64 in the list of Sunshine Coast's 100 most inspirational women, compiled by the Sunshine Coast Daily.\nIn August 2022, Natoli was injured when she slipped and fell just prior to her taking to the stage to MC the Victory in the Pacific ball on the Sunshine Coast. She was treated by paramedics at the scene before being transported to hospital where she underwent surgery for a break in her forearm.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Tony Trigilio (born 1966 in Erie, Pennsylvania) is an American poet, editor, and scholar.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nTrigilio earned a bachelor's degree from Kent State University in 1988, and a master's degree (1990) and Ph.D. (1997) from Northeastern University. He has taught since 1999 at Columbia College Chicago, where he is a professor of English and Creative Writing. He directed Columbia College's M.F.A. program from 2006 to 2009 and 2012–2015, and chaired the school's Creative Writing Department from 2015 to 2017.\nHe is the author and editor of sixteen books, including, most recently, Craft: A Memoir (Marsh Hawk Press, 2023); The Beats and the Academy: A Renegotiation, co-edited with Erik Mortenson (Clemson University Press / Liverpool University Press, 2023); Proof Something Happened, selected by Susan Howe as the winner of the Marsh Hawk Press Poetry Prize (Marsh Hawk, 2021); and Ghosts of the Upper Floor (BlazeVOX [books], 2019), the third installment in his multivolume epic poem, The Complete Dark Shadows (of My Childhood). A volume of his selected poems, Fuera del Taller del Cosmos, was published in Guatemala in 2018 by Editorial Poe (translated by Bony Hernández).\nHis poems have been anthologized widely, most recently in The Best American Poetry (Scribner, 2023), The Eloquent Poem (Persea Books, 2019), The Golden Shovel Anthology: New Poems Honoring Gwendolyn Brooks (University of Arkansas Press, 2017), and Obsessions: Sestinas in the Twenty-First Century (Dartmouth College Press, 2014), among others.\nPoet and scholar Joseph Harrington has praised Trigilio as “one of the most versatile writers in the U.S. today,” noting that Trigilio is “stretching not only poetry, but narrative as well. His books have various forms, voices and topics. You never know what he’ll do next.” Trigilio's innovative incorporation of historical research in his poems has made him a significant figure in contemporary documentary poetry. Reviewing his collection Historic Diary, Margaret Rozga argues that Trigilio's poems “insist that the unanswered questions of history haunt us long after the events are over.” In a review of Trigilio's collection Proof Something Happened, Jerome Sala notes that Trigilio's “Rashomon style” documentary poetics evokes “a sense of time travel: the documentarian style brings you back to the originary moments. You feel you are as close as possible to actual events.”\nTrigilio has earned acclaim for his inventive work with popular culture, autobiography, and poetic form—most notably in his multivolume epic poem, The Complete Dark Shadows (of My Childhood). For this ongoing project begun in 2011, Trigilio is re-watching every episode of the 1960s gothic soap opera, Dark Shadows, which he saw every afternoon with his mother when he was a small child. He writes one sentence in response to each Dark Shadows episode, then shapes these sentences into poetry, prose, and hybrid forms, using each sentence as a conduit for autobiographical explorations. Maggie Millner has praised the project as Trigilio's “effort to face his demons, compose his memoirs, and keep alive the memory of his mother—all the while combining elements of kitsch, ekphrasis, and new formalism.” Joe Milazzo commends the project as a contemporary example of the Italian concept of sprezzatura, first coined in 1528 by Baldassare Castiglione in The Book of the Courtier and defined by Milazzo as the “nonchalant performance of virtuosity.”  The third volume in the series, Ghosts of the Upper Floor, was published by BlazeVOX in 2019. Volume Four, The Punishment Book, is expected in 2024.\nWith Arielle Greenberg and David Trinidad, he co-founded the poetry magazine Court Green in 2004. From 2004 to 2015, Court Green was published in conjunction with Columbia College, and twelve issues of the magazine appeared during that time. In 2017, Trigilio and Trinidad revived Court Green as an independent online poetry journal. Aaron Smith joined Court Green as a co-editor in 2020.\nTrigilio also has published a wide range of literary criticism and scholarship. He is the author of Allen Ginsberg's Buddhist Poetics (Southern Illinois University Press, 2012 [paperback]; 2007 [cloth]) and “Strange Prophecies Anew”: Rereading Apocalypse in Blake, H.D., and Ginsberg (Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2000). In 2014, he edited a posthumous collection of Elise Cowen’s work, Elise Cowen: Poems and Fragments (Ahsahta Press, 2014).\nA past recipient of an Illinois Arts Council Fellowship in Poetry, he lives in Chicago.\n\n\n== Published Works ==\n\n\n=== Poetry ===\nThe Lama’s English Lessons (2006), winner of the Three Candles Press First Book Award\nMake a Joke and I Will Sigh and You Will Laugh and I Will Cry (2008)\nWith the Memory, Which is Enormous (2009)\nHistoric Diary (2011)\nWhite Noise (2013)\nThe Complete Dark Shadows (of My Childhood), Book 1 (2014)\nInside the Walls of My Own House (2016)\nGhosts of the Upper Floor (2019)\nProof Something Happened (2021), winner of the Marsh Hawk Press Poetry Prize\n\n\n=== Creative Nonfiction ===\nCraft: A Memoir (2023)\n\n\n=== Literary Criticism ===\n“Strange Prophecies Anew”: Rereading Apocalypse in Blake, H.D., and Ginsberg (2000)\nAllen Ginsberg's Buddhist Poetics (2012, paperback; 2007, cloth)\n\n\n=== Edited ===\nVisions and Divisions: American Immigration Literature, 1870-1930 (co-edited with Tim Prchal, 2008)\nElise Cowen: Poems and Fragments (2014)\nDispatches from the Body Politic: Interviews with Jan Beatty, Meg Day, and Douglas Kearney (2016)\nThe Beats and the academy: A Renegotiation (co-edited with Erik Mortenson, 2023)\n\n\n== External links ==\nAcademy of American Poets author page\nPoetry Foundation author page\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Solomon Sawrey (1765–1825) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSawrey was born in 1765, received his professional education from Andrew Marshal, M.D. (1742–1813), who taught anatomy privately in Bartlett's Court, Thavies' Inn, from 1785 to 1800. Sawrey attended Marshal's lectures in 1794, and attracted the attention of his master by a dissection of the nerves of the eye. He was admitted a member of the Corporation of Surgeons on 7 July 1796, and he acted for some years as demonstrator to Marshal. He lived first in Bucklersbury and afterwards in Chancery Lane. He practised his profession in both places, and in later life turned his attention more particularly to ophthalmic surgery. He died in 1825.\nHe wrote:\n\n‘A popular View of the Effects of the Venereal Disease upon the Constitution,’ London, 8vo, 1794.\n‘An Inquiry into some of the Effects of the Venereal Poison upon the Human Body,’ London, 8vo, 1802: the work is worthless, for the advance of knowledge has shown that its conclusions are based upon incorrect premisses.\n‘An Account of a newly discovered Membrane in the Human Eye, to which are added some Objections to the Common Operation for Fistula Lacrymalis, and the Suggestion of a New Method of treating that Disease,’ London, 4to, 1807. The newly discovered membrane is now known as Descemet's membrane or the elder Demour's (1702–1795) membrane. The new method of treating fistula consisted in passing a probe through the nasal duct from below upwards, instead of from above downwards, as is usual. It never came into general use. He edited Marshal's ‘Morbid Anatomy of the Brain in Mania and Hydrophobia,’ with a memoir, London, 8vo, 1815.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Power, D'Arcy (1897). \"Sawrey, Solomon\".

        "content": "Ella McKenzie Gross (Korean: 엘라 메켄지 그로스; born December 1, 2008) is an American child model and actress.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nElla McKenzie Gross was born on December 1, 2008, in Los Angeles, California, to a Korean-American mother and German-American father, with the Korean birth name, Nabi (Korean: 나비). She also has a younger brother, born two years apart. \nCited as a \"prodigy\" in both modelling and acting, Gross first featured on the cover of a magazine at age two. She was offered to model for the magazine while Gross was playing at a park in South Korea; around this time her father, a prosecutor in the military at the time, was dispatched to the country from Los Angeles, leading the whole family to visit together. Her mother, who also modelled for children's clothing, viewed the offer as fun. With the start of kindergarten, her modelling advancements were paused for about a year before her request to resume; her mother, who worked as a lawyer, had since fully assisted her daughter's work along her side. Gross modelled for brands Zara, H&M, GAP, Fendi, Lacoste, Levi's, Tommy Hilfiger, and Adidas, and debuted on the runway at age nine at the Tokyo Girls Collection A/W 2018 fashion show held at Saitama Super Arena, Tokyo, Japan, with 30,000 viewers. Gross thereafter walked the runways of Tokyo Girls Collection S/S 2019 and 2019 New York Fashion Week.\nIn July 2018, Gross signed with The Black Label. Its founder, Teddy Park, stated: \"She has a special voice that is completely capable for being a singer as well\". Rosé of Blackpink was also said to have wanted to take a demo song recorded by Gross after a listen. In the midst of her business trips to South Korea from Los Angeles, she often learned dance routines from choreographers. \n\n\n== Public image ==\nGross attained interest in the United States and abroad for her biracial genes and looks, reminiscent of a young Miranda Kerr. Korean media outlets cited her as a young Song Hye-kyo, or was nicknamed as \"little Jennie\" by Blackpink fans following a picture posted with the singer. Her virality on social media platforms led her Instagram account, handled by her mother at the time, to gain a large following.  \n\n\n== Other ventures ==\n\n\n=== Philanthropy ===\nGross served amidst a jury of judges for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) X Uniqlo: Youth with Refugees Art Contest (2023).\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Television series ===\n\n\n== Music videos ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nElla Gross at IMDb",

        "content": "Jamba is an open-weights large language model (LLM) developed by AI21 Labs. It utilizes a Mamba-based model built on a novel state space model (SSM) and transformer hybrid architecture. It is a 52 billion parameter model trained using a mixture-of-experts (MoE) technique with 12B active parameters (number of parameters active per token). Jamba can fit up to 256K tokens in its context window and is the largest Mamba-variant LLM created, or 140k tokens in a single 80GB GPU\nJamba performs well across a number of key measurements including throughput and efficiency while outperforming or matching other state-of-the-art models in its class on a wide range of performance benchmarks while having significantly greater context limits enabling use-cases that require increased context. The model is released with open weights under an Apache 2.0 license\nThe company plans to release a beta-version instruct-tuned version on the AI21 Platform in the near future\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nContext window size: 256k tokens\nParameters: 52 billion\nArchitecture: Hybrid Mamba (SSM) Transformer using Mixture of Experts (MoE)\n\n\n== See also ==\nMamba - deep learning architecture\nMixture of experts - deep learning technique\nAI21 Labs - Tel Aviv (Israel) based AI company\n\n\n== References ==",

It is covered by the arching anterior process, which does not have a tooth-like projection on its back side.\nAs of 2022, it comprises 20 species.\n\n\n== Subgenus Lecythifera ==\nThe subgenus Lecythifera is also characterized by the presence of an intermediate process of the pronotum, and by a toothless anterior process. However, unlike in Cladonota, the intermediate process is not surpassed by the anterior process. The subgenus comprises 21 known species as of 2022. All species with both male and female specimens known are sexually dimorphic, with the exception of C. plummeri.\n\n\n== Subgenus Lobocladisca ==\n\nThe subgenus Lobocladisca is uniquely distinguished by a small tooth-like projection on the back side of the anterior process. Like in the subgenera Cladonota and Lecythifera, species of this subgenus all have an intermediate process on their pronotum. The subgenus comprises nine species as of 2020, many of them only known from the type specimen or the original description, and thus of uncertain validity. Conversely, Cladonota (Lobocladisca) biclavata is the most common species of the genus in all of South America.\n\n\n== Incertae sedis ==\nNo illustration is known for Cladonota brunnea, and the type specimen, discovered in Brazil, has not been preserved. While it is possibly a genetic variation within C. apicalis, the description is considered too insufficient for assignment at the subgenus level.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Elisabeth Guttenberger (née Schneck; 6 February 1926 – 25 March 2024) was a German Holocaust survivor and human rights activist. Of Sinti origin, she survived the Romani Holocaust and testified at the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials after having been interned at the Gypsy family camp.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in Stuttgart on 6 February 1926, Guttenberger lived in her hometown until 1936. Her father, Josef Schneck, was a dealer of antique string instruments. Her mother, Sofie, valued a good education for her children, enrolling them in music lessons. She later stated that her education helped provide her opportunities for administrative offices within Auschwitz. Once Adolf Hitler took power, her family found it difficult to find economic opportunities due to the strict racial criteria. The family moved to Munich in 1936. She was unable to attend secondary school and was forced to abandon her apprenticeship in confectionery due to intervention from the Gestapo and was instead conscripted into working at a munitions factory.On 16 December 1942, the Nazi regime decreed that all Romani still living within German territory must be deported to Auschwitz with the goal of complete extermination. Guttenberger's family was apprehended in Munich on 8 March 1943 and deported to Auschwitz eight days later, where she received the prisoner number Z 3991. The camp consisted of 32 stables with three-story bunks, with up to a thousand prisoners crammed into each stable. She was the only member of her family to survive internment, having learned of her father's death after her freedom. She was transferred to Ravensbrück on 1 August 1944 before being sent to Flossenbürg. The camp was closed on 15 April 1945 and the prisoners were sent on a death march to Marienbad. She was liberated by American troops in late April 1945.After the war, Guttenberger was called to testify in the Frankfurt trials, which took place from 1963 to 1965. Although she was unable to attend the trial, her testimony was read by investigating judge Heinz Düx before the Pforzheim District Court. However, the court did not find her testimony conclusive. After the trials, she regularly testified at the commemoration of the Reichstag building in Berlin, notably on the 50th anniversary of the \"Auschwitz decree\" in 1992. She also spoke at the opening of the Documentation and Cultural Centre of German Sinti and Roma in 1997. On 2 August 2014, her testimony was read by Olga Grjasnowa at an event organized by the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, taking place at the Memorial to the Sinti and Roma Victims of National Socialism.In March 2008, a Stolperstein bearing the names of Guttenberger's family members was placed outside their former home in Stuttgart. The organizing group was awarded the Alfred Hausser Prize by the Association of Persecutees of the Nazi Regime – Federation of Antifascists and she was present at the awards ceremony.Elisabeth Guttenberger died on 25 March 2024, at the age of 98.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nAdler, H.

Supadevi is considered to fulfill the wishes of devotees. In addition to goddess Bhagavati, there are idols of Ganesh, Mahakali, Mahalaxmi and Shiva in the temple. The donation received from the devotee is used to run two local schools.\n\n\n== Mythology ==\nAccording to mythology, during the Baise-Chaubise era, a marriage was decided between the prince of Khanchikot and the princess of Balrampur, India. On the wedding day, while returning to Arghakhanchi with the bride, there was a plan to feed the people on the way. During the feast, there was a dispute among the people regarding the caste of bride.\nRegardless of the controversy, the bride was taken towards Khanchikot. However, blood started leaking from the pallaquin carrying the bride. When the people looked inside, the bride had committed suicide. From the next day, villages started suffering from unknown disease. A Jhankri said that the dead princess has appeared in the form of Devi and should be worshipped. The villagers gathered in the place where the blood had appeared and started worshipping the place.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe temple was constructed in 1600 B.S. by King of Khanchi, Biswa Pal Shah in the name of his daughter Subarna Kumari and installed the Bhagwati devi goddess. Daily prayer is offered to the goddess. Animal sacrifice is done except on the days of new moon, Shri panchami, Rishi panchani, Krishna Jamastami, Ekadashi, Aksyha Tritiya and Ram Nawami.\nDaily prayer was started from 2040 BS and a new structure in pagoda shape was constructed in 2042 BS.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Green Valley, previously called Toll Town, is a ghost town in northeast Denton County in the state of Texas in the United States of America. The ghost town is about 8 miles [CONVERT] away from the city of Denton and rests near the Elm Fork in the Trinity River. The town received its name for the valley it rested in.\nThe site is one of the several ghost towns in Denton County, and one of many in Texas. Some notable ones in Denton County include Elizabethtown, Drop, Stony, and Alton.\n\n\n== History ==\nSettlers began to move toward a valley located in between the Trinity River and two nearby creeks in the year 1870, five years after the end of the American Civil War. They were drawn to the valley because of its abundance of water, fertile soil, and a large amount of trees that would protect settlers from Native Americans. A village eventually formed, originally called Toll Town. The reason for this naming is believed to be because of two roads or trails that intersected at the site of the village. Sometime in the early 1870s, a man named Henry Clay Wilmoth arrived at Toll Town and began teaching at a subscription school.\nLocals began to want a post office to make their town official, so Henry applied for one to be set up in Toll Town, and the request was accepted. The post office was later granted in 1874. Everyone soon wanted a different name for the town. Henry made the suggestion that the town be named \"Green Valley\" due to the surrounding landscape, and the name was officially changed in 1878.\nAfter the post office was constructed, the town grew with the addition of three stores and a blacksmith shop. Green Valley had a population of 50 people around this time, and plans were made to construct more schools and form the Green Valley School District. It isn't known at what time these were made, but a church and cemetery were constructed as well.\nIn 1880, a man who has been documented as Mr. C.A. Hankins, was mining limestone when bright yellow chunks blew out of the rocks. He believed what he found to be gold, so he traveled to Denton and the community was ecstatic. But he soon learned that what he found was known as \"fools gold\", which was mostly sulfur.\n\n\n=== Green Valley School District ===\nIn 1883 a second subscription school was opened only about a hundred yards from the first one. According to residents of the time, the school was \"poorly furnished\" and parents had to either make or bring their own furniture and equipment. Later, in the spring of 1884, the two schools were organized to form District Number 20, also known as Green Valley School District 20. Once the district was organized, another schoolhouse was built in the center of the town.\nApparently the location of the school had citizens upset. Families that lived further north wanted the school to be closer to them, as with the families that lived in the southern portion of Green Valley. This led to a division in the types of students that attended; the \"Northern crowd\" and the \"Southern crowd.\" Similarly to the previous ones, this school was also poorly constructed. It had no solid foundation, and animals, particularly rabbits and dogs, would get inside the school and make a commotion. In March 1984 students arrived to school to find that the schoolhouse was gone. The previous night, unknown conditions had caused the school to burn down.\nAfter the old school was gone the leader of the South Crowd knew he wouldn't be able to relocate a new schoolhouse closer to the southern portion of the town, so it was built where the old one was. This caused further conflicts between the two crowds, and a vote was held to move the new school a half-mile north of the old one. This school was much more modern and was perfectly suitable for students to attend comfortably. However, around 10–12 years later, the building was demolished and construction on a new one began.\nLong after the decline of Green Valley, yet another school opened in 1919, when the district was annexed into the Denton Independent School District. Operations at the new school lasted much longer than all the others, and students attended first through tenth grade up until 1935 when it was decided that children would attend until their ninth year, then go to Denton schools for their tenth and eleventh. The school remained open until 1949.\n\n\n== Decline ==\nDespite the activity at the Green Valley School District before the new school was even constructed, Green Valley began to decline shortly after the year 1881. Like many other ghost towns in North Texas at the time, this was due to the Texas and Pacific Railway. The railway system was supposed to bring people to Green Valley in a modern and much quicker way. However, the railroads bypassed the town by about 5 miles. Shortly after, the town of Aubrey was founded and almost everyone in Green Valley moved there to be closer to the railroad.\n\n\n== Current State ==\nCurrently Green Valley rests near Aubrey, Denton, Krugerville, and Cooper Creek. The church, Green Valley School, and the cemetery all still remain in the area and in active use. The school has been repurposed as a community center for anyone to use. An RV park has also been constructed in the northern portion of the site. Much of the area has also been secured by the United States Army Corps of Engineers for Ray Roberts Lake. People still live in Green Valley, although it is unknown what the population count is as of 2024. These factors have lead to debate over whether to consider Green Valley as a ghost town or an unincorporated community.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nGreen Valley is near the towns of Aubrey, Denton, and Krugerville in the north-eastern part of Denton County. The ghost town is located on Farm-to-Market Road 2153 and Shepard Road. The ZIP Code for the area is 76227.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "St James' Church is the parish church of Boroughbridge, a town in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThe original St James' Church was a medieval chapel-of-ease to St Andrew's Church, Aldborough, located in what is now St James's Square.  The current church was built on Church Lane in 1852, to a design by James Mallinson and Thomas Healey.  It is in the Decorated style, but is a simple, pared-back design.  C. P. Canfield describes the building as \"a moderately large church... the subscribers got a lot of accommodation for their money\".  The tower is said to be a copy of the tower of the Mediaeval church.  The building was Grade II listed in 1984.\nThe church is built of sandstone with roofs of stone slate and tile.  It consists of a nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, a south porch, a chancel and a west tower.  The tower has three stages, a north stair turret, stepped angle buttresses rising to embattled corner turrets, string courses, a west window with a pointed arch and hood mould, lancet windows and clock faces in the middle stage, two-light bell openings with hood moulds, and an embattled parapet.\nThe east window has four lights, and stained glass by William Wailes.  Re-set into the internal walls are late Norman architectural fragments.  They form a random collection and, other than the possible arch of a priest's door, were set into the walls of the former church.  These may have originally formed part of one or more earlier churches and have been used in reconstructing the chapel at Boroughbridge, perhaps after a raid by Scots in the early 13th century.\n\n\n== See also ==\nListed buildings in Boroughbridge\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The immediate origins of the genocidal killings in Southern Kaduna especially in the 2010s and early 2020s can be traced to the events that brought in Goodluck Jonathan into power in 2010 as the President of Nigeria, and escalated after the presidential election in 2011, which he won.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIt could be recounted that during the 2011 Nigerian presidential election campaign aired on the Nation television, the NTA, the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) candidate, Muhammadu Buhari while addressing a crowd in Kano in the Hausa language, called for mass violence as the crowd cheered. In his exact words as captured by TheCable thus, \"Ku fita ku yi zabe. Ku Kasa, ku tsare, ku raka ku tsaya. Duk wanda bai yarda ba, ku halaka shi.\" The subtitles captured in the video had the following words, \"Firstly, you must register, come out and vote. You guard, protect, escort to the collation centre and you wait until the result is counted. Anyone who stops you, kill them!!! (Crowd chants wildly.)\" Even though Buhari's supporters tried to give another meaning to this statement, the reality was seen after the election was lost to Jonathan.\nThe violence that erupted after Jonathan's victory in 2011 spread across the northern states of Nigeria with over 65,000 said to be displaced as a result. Although Kaduna State had seen crises in the past, they seem to have escalated during this period in time.\nIn the 2011 Kaduna State gubernatorial election, Patrick Yakowa emerged as the first Christian and Southern Kaduna indigene to be elected as governor of Kaduna State. He had earlier served as governor after the sitting governor, Namadi Sambo was picked by Goodluck Jonathan to become the Vice President of Nigeria following the death of President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua in 2010. Muslim leaders in the state were not happy and threatened to resist the elevation of a Christian as governor of Kaduna State.\nYakowa's tenure was not to last long as his life was to be ended in 2012. His deputy, Mukhtar Ramalan Yero took over as governor of Kaduna State after he was killed in a helicopter crash in Bayelsa State alongside former National Security Adviser, Owoye Andrew Azazi. Yakowa's death was later discovered to have been plotted by an Islamic cleric, Isa Pantami (who would later 2019–2023 serve as a minister in the Buhari government), and some Northern Muslim leaders in 2010, who saw having Yakowa, a Christian, as governor of Kaduna State as \"an insult to Islam in the country\". The Taraba State governor, Danbaba Suntai also faced same attack but narrowly escaped.\n\nOn July 15, 2012, former FCT minister, Nasir el-Rufai, tweeted, \"Anyone, soldier or not that kills the Fulani takes a loan repayable one day no matter how long it takes.\"\nYero's tenure was marred with attacks by \"unknown gunmen\" (later discovered to be Fulani herdsmen) in the Southern Kaduna area, causing him to be unpopular among the people. This is in addition to his unpopular choice of Nuhu Bajoga as deputy governor. Southern Kaduna vowed to vote out governor Yero and president Jonathan in the 2015 gubernatorial and presidential elections, due to their insensitivity to the killings by the Fulani gunmen in the region.\nIn the 2015 Kaduna State gubernatorial election, Nasir el-Rufai of the APC defeated Mukhtar Ramalan Yero of the PDP.\nEl-Rufai picked Barnabas Bala Bantex as running mate. In spite of the rumors about the two not getting along, el-Rufai denied that their relationship was cordial. Bantex resigned in 2019 to contest for the senate of Kaduna South senatorial district under APC which he lost to the sitting senator, Danjuma Laah, of the PDP. In the 2019 Kaduna State gubernatorial election, el-Rufai selected a Muslim woman, Hadiza Balarabe from Southern Kaduna, as running mate under the APC. This would be the first time a Muslim-Muslim ticket would be experimented in Kaduna State since the return of democracy 1999. He, however, defended his choice saying the government house is neither a mosque nor a church.\n\n\n== Paying of Fulani terrorists \"to stop killing\" ==\nIn December 2016, in an open interview the Kaduna State governor, Nasir Ahmed Musa el-Rufai confessed to paying some Fulanis across the Sahel countries to stop killing Southern Kaduna indigenes due to the grievances erupting from the killing of their cattles in the 2011 post election crisis in the state. During that period, the governor said 204 people lost their lives while the Catholic Church in Kaduna State said 808 people were killed by the armed bandits.\n\nIn response to the above, the sitting senator representing Kaduna South Senatorial District, Danjuma Laah, said there was never a time in 2011 that Fulanis in those Sahel countries mentioned by the governor such as Niger, Mali, Chad and others were killed with their cattle in the Southern Kaduna as the area is not a converging point for those countries and called el-Rufai's claim a lie. According to him, \"The Governor just invented this lie to make excuse for his imported murderous Fulani kindred to continue their extermination of our people and the occupation of our lands.\"\nIn April 2021, el-Rufai made a turn-around and said anyone caught negotiating with bandits would be severely dealt with.\n\n\n== Grazing reserves in Southern Kaduna ==\nThe governor, el-Rufai, proposed to create cattle grazing reserves for the Fulanis in 16 separate locations in the state on 180,000 hectares of land and Southern Kaduna was to provide 130,000 hectares in six locations viewed as being strategic. The Southern Kaduna People's Union (SOKAPU) points on this plan as a cause for the immediate crises, but the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) denied this claim.\nAccording to the SOKAPU President, Dr. Musa Kaptain Solomon:\n\nSOKAPU is standing on this assertion based on the genesis of the ongoing killings. As soon as the government of Nasir el-Rufai announced plans which he said was to resuscitate what he claimed were old grazing reserves in Southern Kaduna, we resisted. We already had a normal relationship in which Fulani graze cattle in our communities' lands free-of-charge and they were normal parts of our communities. They graze their cattle as usual, leave during the seasonal migration, and return when they like. We keep their belongings safely until their return. Forget about the unfortunate 2011 crisis, which was ignited by CPC thugs in Kaduna, Zaria, Zonkwa, Kafanchan and so on. That was a politically motivated issue, and had no relationship with grazing\nIn June 2016, Southern Kaduna in its entirety through the SOKAPU kicked against this plan as it was viewed with suspicious motives which would allocate an additional 5,000 hectares to the Federal Government for the same grazing reserve for the Fulanis making 17 in all. The SOKAPU also claims that between 2011 and 2016, over 4,000 people lost their lives in 54 documented attacks.\nThe SOKAPU President, Musa, in November 2016, in an interview said, \"Grazing reserve is like robbing Peter to pay Paul\".\n\n\n== Arrest of journalists for criticizing the regime ==\nOn 27 April 2016, a Kaduna-based journalist, Jacob Onjewu Dickson, a reporter for Authentic News Daily, a news website, got arrested. He reportedly wrote a report stating that the Kaduna State governor, el-Rufai, was pelted with rocks by youths on a peace-brokering mission.\nOn 26 October 2016, a public commentator and former Kaduna State University lecturer, John Danfulani, got arrested over his Facebook post criticizing Nasir el-Rufai's government and detained for 13 days.\nIn July 2017, Luka Binniyat, the SOKAPU spokesman joined the list of journalists to be arrested and detained by the Kaduna State governor, Nasir el-Rufai, for criticizing his approach to handling the attacks in Southern Kaduna. He spent over 100 days in detention and was released in October 2017.\nOn 8 May 2019, another journalist, Stephen Kefas, was arrested by the Police in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, and later transferred to Kaduna based on \"orders from above\". His offense was reposting a post on Facebook made by Sahara Reporters on the kidnap and murder of the Agom Adara, HRH Raphael Maiwada Galadima. He was remanded in the Kaduna prison. There was a protest staged for his release by three groups, with some protesters labeling the act tyrannic.\nOn 4 November 2021, Luka Binniyat was again arrested in his office in the SOKAPU secretariat in Kaduna, after his report of 28 October 2021, on the US news website, The Epoch Times, again on the Kaduna State government's way of tackling the killings in Southern Kaduna. The Committee to Protect Journalists also urged the Nigerian government to \"immediately and unconditionally\" release Luka Binniyat and drop all charges against him on November 15, 2021. He was, however, released on 3 February 2022.\nOther human rights abuses by el-Rufai were listed by the human rights campaigner and lawyer, Prof. Chidi Odinkalu.\n\n\n== Renaming of chiefdoms and creation of emirates in Southern Kaduna; and arrests, kidnap and murder of Southern Kaduna traditional rulers ==\nIn March 2017, the B'gwam Akurmi, HRH Ishaku S. Damina, was arrested by the Kaduna State governor, Nasir el-Rufai. The reason for his arrest as narrated by the Southern Kaduna People's Union (SOKAPU) spokesman, Luka Binniyat, was that he handed over a Fulani man suspected of being a notorious kidnapper in the area to the Nigerian Army, in whose custody he died. The Akurmi youths took to the media to demand for the release of their ruler.\nIn October 2017, Daily Trust reported the plans to restructure 32 chiefdoms and emirates in Kaduna State, out of which 13 chiefdoms and emirates in the central and southern senatorial districts of the state would be renamed. Earlier in June of that year, 313 districts and 4,453 village heads were reportedly sacked by the el-Rufai administration with the excuse of lessening the financial burden posed by the local government councils. This reform led to the reverting to the pre-2001 77 districts and 1,429 village units at the time of the deregulation of the traditional institution by the then-governor, Ahmed Mohammed Makarfi. The affected institutions, however, challenged this decision in court.\nIn the early hours of January 1, 2018, the Etum Numana, HRH Gambo Makama, and his pregnant wife were attacked and killed in their home in Arak village, Sanga LGA. The chief's 45-year-old son sustained injuries.\nOn 3 January 2018, the Agom Akulu, HRH Yohanna Sidi Kukah, chief of the Akulu Chiefdom, was also kidnapped by some unknown gunmen. The chief is a younger brother of the Catholic Archbishop of Sokoto, Bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah. He was, however, released a few days later.\n\nIn June 2018, a former Chairman of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), Prof. Chidi Odinkalu, and the founder of the Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC), Dr. Frederick Fasehun, tackled el-Rufai, on the decision to convert some chiefdoms to emirates in the state. This resulted from the letter titled \"Review of Nomenclature of chiefdoms in Kaduna State\" addressed to the Chief of Kauru, written on May 30, 2018, in which the governor directed the chief, HRH Alhaji Ja'afaru Abubakar, to refer to himself as an emir. The letter states, \"I am directed to inform you that you are to be respectfully addressed as the Emir of Kauru Emirate Council. Kindly accept the esteemed regards of the commissioner at all times.\" The motive behind this was questioned and termed unconstitutional. The OPC leader also commended the joint resolution by the Nigerian National Assembly to sanction President Muhammadu Buhari over his attitude towards the ongoing killings in parts of that country.\nIn October 2018, the Agom Adara, HRH Dr. Raphael Maiwada Galadima, was kidnapped alongside his wife and driver at Maikyali village along the Kaduna-Kachia road on his way back to his palace in Kachia after accompanying el-Rufai to Kasuwan Magani to an attack site. The wife and driver of the chief were later released while the chief remained in the kidnappers' den. Sahara Reporters reported that the kidnappers of the chief said before he was murdered, \"Even if they pay your ransom, we will still kill you; that is the order we have.\"\nHis murder was said to be the result of his refusal of the governor's plan to balkanize the Adara Chiefdom to accommodate a Kajuru Emirate.\nIn July 2021, the Kpop Ham, HRH Jonathan Gyet Maude, was also kidnapped.\nOther name changes included the Atyap Chiefdom being renamed Zangon Kataf Chiefdom and its ruler, the Agwatyap, HRH Sir Dominic Yahaya, demoted to a second class status. This change affected other chiefdoms as well. Some other chiefdoms were split to make way for newer chiefdoms and emirates in contradiction to the governor's excuse of cost reduction earlier given for the reduction of the numbers of districts and village wards per traditional council.\nSOKAPU added that the conversation of chiefdoms to emirates have also heightened the situation.\n\n\n== Demand for Hausa-Fulani chiefdoms ==\nIn August 2020, there was also a demand for chiefdoms by Fulani groups, led by the Chief Imam of Kafanchan, Kabir Kasim. He claimed most of the major towns in Southern Kaduna were founded by the \"Hausa-Fulani\" whom he claimed are the largest single ethnic group in the area, and are often viewed as targets. He added that Southern Kaduna was founded by a Fulani tribe called the Kachechere and that other Southern Kaduna groups were migrants from northern states of Nigeria. He again said, \"We hereby debunk the claims of the Southern Kaduna People's Union (SOKAPU) of its personal interest that its members are the only indigenes of Southern Kaduna. Happily. the constitution of the country is seriously against the indigene/settler dichotomy,\" He, thereafter, demanded that a law should be enacted to stop the calling of the Hausa and the Fulani settlers in Southern Kaduna.\n\nThese demands have, however, been rejected by Southern Kaduna indigenous communities, represented by the SOKAPU President, Jonathan Asake, who in his response with Sahara Reporters, said the governor's agenda was to embark on ethnic cleansing in Southern Kaduna which has encouraged such demands by the Fulani community. He added, \"They can go and claim Kano because most of these people causing these havoc come from Kano, Sokoto, Katsina and Jigawa. They are not indigenes of Southern Kaduna. El-Rufai is giving them the latitude to cause this problem when they said they want their own chiefdom. It is not chiefdom, it is emirate they are looking for. I want to let him know that before him there were governors and after him there will be governors who will bring peace we need in Kaduna State.\"\n\n\n== Attacks on Southern Kaduna villages, curfew impositions, and killings with impunity by Fulani terrorists ==\n\nOn 25 August 2016, in a press statement signed by the SOKAPU President, Kaptain Solomon Musa, the SOKAPU leadership pointed out the previous confessions by the Kaduna State governor about knowing who the killers were doing nothing to stop the killings in the region, and challenged the people of Southern Kaduna to defend themselves, calling for el-Rufai's resignation. The protest, done in collaboration with the Coalition of Professionals led by Barr. Mark Nzamah Jacob, in Gwantu, followed the continuous killings of Southern Kaduna indigenous peoples in Sanga LGA, by Fulani herdsmen. The SOKAPU leader demanded that Southern Kaduna should be included in the joint military operations undertaken by the present government of Kaduna State in the forest and bushes of Birnin Gwari to rescue rustled cows and goats to save human lives and properties. An estimated figure of 10,000 indigenes of Southern Kaduna from 24 villages were said to have been killed since the invasion of their communities started in 2011. In addition, in 2014 in Sanga alone, about 30,000 refugees fled killing and arson by the herdsmen. In Musa's words, \"...those natives are yet to return home as herdsmen have converted they farm lands into grazing grounds, under arms.\" The leaders thanked the governor for visiting some of the affected communities but pressed on for more to be done after the usual political promise of ending the killings and nothing happening. They said two days after the governor's visit, the pastor of the RCCG, Ungwan Anjo, Godogodo chiefdom, Luka Ubangari, was killed by suspected herdsmen, adding that same herdsmen went to the Ningon Community and killed two men, Gambo Sule and Benjamin Auta, two days later. They lamented that with all those acts, no one has been arrested and charged, instead youths who put their lives on the line to protect their communities are the ones getting arrested and locked up always by the police and soldiers.  They recalled a statement made by Haruna Usman, the Kaduna State chairman of MACBAN, who said that the killing and destruction in Gada Biu, Akwaa, Ungwan Anjo and Godogodo were a revenge for the killing of a Fulani leader (or Ardo) in the area.\nIn January 2017, the Kaduna State Council of Imams and Ulamas led by its chairman, Sheikh Abubakar Babantune and secretary, Aminu Ibrahim, organised a press conference making accusations and calling for the arrest and prosecution of Southern Kaduna chieftains and Christian religious leaders including the senator representing Kaduna South senatorial district, Danjuma Laah; a member of the House of Representatives, Sunday Marshall Katung; clergymen like Rev. Zachariah Gado of 19 DCC Fellowship; CAN President, Samson Ayokunle; CAN Secretary-General, Musa Asake; former KASU lecturer, John Danfulani. They accused them of encouraging the killings in the region. They also called for the prosecution of Zamani Lekwot and five others sentenced to death by the Okadigbo tribunal investigating the 1992 Zangon Kataf crises. Furthermore, they asked for a review of the \"White paper of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Kaduna State Religious Disturbances of 2001\", pressing for the arrest of Elder Saídu Dogo, Archbishop P.Y. Jatau, and Archbishop B.A. Achigili; and the \"White paper on the report of the Federal Government Investigation Panel on the 2011 Election Violence and Civil Disturbances\", asking for the investigation of a History Teacher who slaughtered his student's father in her presence. \n\nIn June 2020, el-Rufai set up a 'White Paper Committee' to investigate the 1992 Zangon Kataf crises. According to Premium Times Nigeria's report by his special adviser on media and communications, Muyiwa Adekeye, The events of 11th and 12th June 2020 in Zangon-Kataf and Kauru LGAs offer compelling evidence that these persistent contentions over farmlands is a conflict trigger that has to be boldly addressed, rather than wished away.\nIn July 2020, Fulani chieftains represented by the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association (MACBAN) said there were 3,099 Fulani IDPs in Southern Kaduna. They also reported missing persons and lost animals.\nAs of 30 October 2020, at least 100 Southern Kaduna villages were under Fulani occupation according to SOKAPU. There had been incessant attacks across four Southern Kaduna LGAs since Nasir el-Rufai came in as governor of Kaduna State. These include Chikun, Kajuru, Kachia and Zangon Kataf. The pattern had been that of the killing of the indigenous population and replacement with the Fulani population.\nOther affected LGAs include Kaura, Kauru and Jema'a. After an attack by the terrorists on the indigenous communities, curfews were usually imposed by the state government and that gives room for further killings. Some of the killings especially in the Zangon Kataf axis were alluded to the 1992 Zangon Kataf crises, like in the case of 30-year-old Yusuf, an Atyap young man, whose mutilated body was found at the bank of the Kaduna River on June 10, 2020.\nWhenever youths from communities protest the act, they get arrested and detained while the killers go undetected. On 15 August 2020, a street reporter, Beevan Magoni, led a protest against the trends. Southern Kaduna youths in Kaduna, Abuja and Lagos went out peacefully to protest the killings which they termed as \"genocide\". Some youths got arrested in Kaduna by the police over the excuse of not informing the authorities of their plans.\nIn March 2021, soldiers opened fire on women peacefully protesting the indiscriminate arrests of their children in Kanai district, Atyap Chiefdom, killing one woman on the spot, shooting two others with one dying later on, and injuring many others.\n\nOn 31 March 2021, SOKAPU reported how the Commander of the Nigerian Army Operation Safe Haven, Major General Dominic Onyemulu, got about 15 Atyap community leaders among which were village heads, arrested. He was said to have tricked them into a meeting at one of their operational base on Ungwan Rimi-Bajju road, close to Kafanchan whence they were arrested. Their offence was said to be the killing of 75 cattle (figures later adjusted to 300) and some sheep. They stayed four days in military illegal incarceration, then passed to the Kafanchan Police Area Command. Among them was Waje Laah, an unwell 85-year-old great-grandfather. They were said to have been kept by the police for six days under dehumanizing conditions before being transferred to the Kaduna State Police Command Headquarters in Kaduna. In his words, the SOKAPU spokesman, Luka Binniyat said, \"Not a single Fulani leader has been called for questioning not to talk of being detained. We also said that under Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State, that has been the style of justice – victims are dragged and punished, while the alleged murderers are walking free with no consequence to their actions.\"\nIn February 2022, the MACBAN chairman in Kaduna, Haruna Tugga, said not less than 10 Fulani herders, including a one-year-old infant, were killed; with 99 cows either poisoned or missing between January 22 and February 2, 2022.\nAdara and Atyap lands, in particular, had been under constant Fulani terror attacks between early 2020 to mid-2023. Awemi Dio Maisamari, the National President of the Adara Development Association (ADA), said between January and May 2020, no fewer than 107 people have been killed, 49 injured, about 66 persons kidnapped, 111 houses burnt, 32 villages destroyed and about 20,000 displaced. Many Atyap villages were sacked and many killed in the same unprovoked attacks, a situation which the Hausa community in the Zangon Urban district had distanced itself from in spite of allegations levelled against it by the Atyap Community Development Association (ACDA) of harbouring Fulani terrorists in the settlement. \nOn May 1, 2023, the ACDA organized a World Press Conference to voice out the ongoing genocide in its territory. Sun News Online reported the ACDA National President, Samuel T. Achie saying, \"As of the last count, 20 villages have been displaced, 18 villages burnt down, while 518 people killed with thousands of victims who have taken refuge across many communities from 2017 till date.\" In less than 24 hours before leaving office on May 29, 2023, the state governor, Nasir el-Rufai proscribed the ACDA, calling it an illegal entity. In response, the National President of the ACDA said the proscription would be challenged in court because it is an infringement on freedom of association.\n\nIn April 2023, the SOKAPU National President, Awemi Dio Maisamari, advocated for a UN/AU base in Southern Kaduna. In his words, \"We advocate for a UN or AU Peace Enforcement Operations Base in Southern Kaduna. This will practicality demonstrate that the world is interested in our collective survival as minority ethnic groups. It must not abandon us to be hounded by well funded and well-armed herdsmen who are being encouraged and protected by their powerful kinsmen and collaborators in and outside Nigeria.  In the past 6 years, about 63 Atyap communities have been attacked, hundreds of homes burnt and hundreds of natives killed by pillaging armed herdsmen. Not a single Fulani is facing prosecution for these crimes. Ironically, scores of Atyap leaders have been arrested and put in jail over trumped up charges in the violence in which they are the victims.\"...\nIn March 2024, SOKAPU through its spokesman, Josiah Abraks, showed delight over the decision by the Governor of Kaduna State, Uba Sani, el-Rufai's successor, to resettle the displaced communities in Southern Kaduna with the inauguration of a 10-man committee. This came after the State Security Council's recommendation issued on November 8, 2023, to resettle displaced persons in their original settlements. Responding to an interview question by a Punch Nigeria reporter, Samuel Tabara Kato, the SOKAPU National President said repentant terrorists should not be allowed to join the security agencies.\n\n\n== Unequal humanitarian treatment ==\nThe responsibility of fending for the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) affected by the attacks in Southern Kaduna, especially the indigenous populations, were heavily on the families, religious institutions and individual donors. The government and National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) most times failed to extend the same concern to indigenous Southern Kaduna IDPs as they would to other IDPs elsewhere in the state.\n\n\n== Muslim-Muslim ticket ==\nIn June 2023 after his tenure as governor, Nasir el-Rufai was known to have made a statement while addressing Islamic clerics on the imposition of a Muslim governor and Muslim deputy governor on Kaduna State as an experiment to be replicated in Nigeria at the Federal government level. He made the statement in Hausa and was transcribed to English, afterwards.\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary of the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Dr. Solomon Dogo, while condemning the statement by el-Rufai said the video has revealed the much-talked about Islamization agenda on ground. He added, \"His eight years in power as governor, characterised with massive killings and decimation of Christian-dominated areas of Southern Kaduna, can now be understood.\"\n\n\n== Impact on indigenous cultural bonding ==\n\nIn the aspect of culture, most Southern Kaduna cultural festivals usually celebrated towards the end and beginning of the year had been halted with the lasts held between late-2019 and early-2020. These festivities only resumed with the exit of the Nasir el-Rufai regime on 29 May 2023. This exit was greeted with the introduction of the maiden Southern Kaduna Cultural Festival (SKFEST) held mainly in the township stadium, Kafanchan, between 28 and 30 December 2023. Over 20 of the about 57 ethnic nationalities in Southern Kaduna partook in the festival.\nThe Agwatyap's Buffet was also held in the Agwatyap's palace, Atak Njei, Zangon Kataf, on 31 December 2023. This was in honour of the Nigerian Chief of Defence Staff, Christopher Gwabin Musa, an indigene of the area, selected by the new president, Bola Tinubu, who came in few months back, to take the position. This was greeted by the people with excitement. On the same day, the Nom Bajju annual cultural festival celebration also resumed in Zonkwa after being celebrated last 18 years back, in 2005.\nOn 1 January 2024, the town of  Gworog saw the comeback of the Afan National Festival, last celebrated in 2020.\nIn March 2024, the Khituk Gwong was held in Kagoma, and the Tuk-Ham in Kwain. These festivities are a way of preserving the people's cultures, building friendship and helping their languages remain.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSouthern Kaduna Crisis\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHundeyin, David (24 December 2022). \"Southern Kaduna: Blood, Tears, Anger [DOCUMENTARY]\" [Something truly abominable is happening in Southern Kaduna.

        "content": "St Andrew's Church is the parish church of Aldborough, North Yorkshire, a village in England.\nAldborough is the site of the Roman town of Isurium Brigantum, and it is believed that the church lies on the site of a temple to Mercury.  Two churches successively occupied the site before the present building was commenced, in the early 14th century.  In 1318, the building was partly destroyed by raiders from Scotland, but it was repaired, with a north chantry chapel added in 1333, and the north aisle dating from about 1360.  The clerestory dates from the 15th century, the roof was restored in the 16th century, and the south aisle was rebuilt in 1827.  The church was Grade I listed in 1966.\nThe church is built of red sandstone with a lead roof, and consists of a nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, a chancel, a north chapel, and a west tower.  The tower has angle buttresses, a west window with a pointed arch and hood mould, a clock face on the west side, two-light bell openings, and an embattled parapet.  The east window has five lights and is in Perpendicular style.\nInside, the roof is panelled, with bosses.  There is Mediaeval stained glass in the north aisle, and 14th-century canopies which would originally have sheltered figures.  There is a weathered Roman sculpture which may represent Mercury, a 16th-century panel depicting Daniel in the Lion's Den, and a brass of William of Adleburgh, dating from around 1360.  There is 17th-century panelling in the chancel, moved from elsewhere, a communion rail from about 1700, and 18th-century breadshelves.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGrade I listed buildings in North Yorkshire\nListed buildings in Boroughbridge\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Clara Osborne Botzum (April 11, 1894 – 1986) was an Arizona state representative whose work focused on the development of Parker, Arizona, and the Colorado River Valley. She was the first woman to chair the Mines and Mining Committee.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nOsborne was born on April 11, 1894, in Indianapolis. In 1900, the Osborne family moved to Parker, where her father owned a mine. Her family later moved to Pasadena, California, where Osborne attended the Wilson School, Grand School, Girls Collegiate School, and the Theop Institute.\nOsborne married Lieutenant Charles O. Botzum, who she divorced after five years. Osborne moved back to Arizona, where she was active in her family's mines. Possibly due to the economic downturn mines faced in the 1920s, Botzum began working as a secretary of the Northern Yuma County Chamber of Commerce by 1930. Botzum was particularly dedicated to the creation of the Parker Bridge, which she advocated for with Isabella Greenway. In September 1937, Botzum cut the ribbon dedicating the bridge.\nBotzum also worked as a miner, In 1938, her Lion Hill Mine was \"said to have yielded the highest gold content ever found in Arizona.\"\nBotzum ran for state senate in 1934, but was beat by Nellie T. Bush. In 1942, Botzum was elected to the Arizona House of Representatives as the Yuma County representative as a Democrat. She was re-elected for a term from 1958 to 1962, for a total of six terms. She served as vice-chair of the state government committee and chair of the mining committee. She was the first woman to chair the Mines and Mining Committee, earning the title \"The Mining Lady.\"\nBotzum continued to work to improve Parker's economy. During World War II, she convinced the federal government to mine war-minerals locally. As Parker had not had a bank in decades, she convinced a banker to open one. She was the honorary chair of the creation of a new county, ultimately leading to the creation of La Paz County, Arizona, with Parker as the county seat.\nBotzum died in 1986 on a trip to San Diego.\n\n\n== Honors and awards ==\nJan. 4, 1979: Parker Bridge was rededicated in honor of Botzum\n1983: Spirit of Arizona Award, Arizona Senate\n1990: Arizona Women's Hall of Fame\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Espumilla is a traditional Ecuadorian meringue and popular street food. The word \"espumilla\" means \"foam\" in Spanish. It possibly is dated back to 1907 with records mentioning its existence. It is made with egg whites, sugar, and fruit pulp, often guava, frequently whipped by hand to achieve the right texture. It resembles ice cream and is often sold in ice cream cones. \nOriginally from downtown Quito, it is now sold by street vendors across Ecuador, including schools, plazas, and fruit markets. Espumilla can vary in flavor and garnishes, sometimes topped with Ecuadorian blackberry syrup called arrope de mora. The two most common flavors are  guava and blackberry in Ecuador. However, other flavors include banana, strawberries, and naranjilla. The dessert represents a part of Ecuadorian culinary heritage and is popular among locals and tourists. \nThey are also found in Venezuela, Guatemala and Nicaragua.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Cal York, an amalgam of California and New York, was a pseudonymous name used in the American film magazine Photoplay that ran from 1911 to 1980. Popular entertainment scholar Anthony Slide considered it one of the most reliable voices in the old Hollywood gossip columns. York (presumably the editors) was the \"columnist\" for \"Inside Stuff,\" and also a contributor to other parts of the magazine, including \"Plays and Players.\" Not every film scholar seems aware of the pseudonym, as many quote York without noting the meaning behind the name. Slide notes that the surname York once morphed to Yorke, assuming a typo, but it may also have been an inside joke. He adds that toward the end of the magazine's life West Coast editor Richard Cuskelly wrote as Cal York. By the 1970s Photoplay was still using the old name, but Slide considered it an echo of the past.\nThere was also a character named Cal York in the 1955 American drama Toughest Man Alive, and it may have been a wink to the long-running character.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Andrew Marshal (1742 – 4 April 1813) was a Scottish physician and anatomist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMarshal was born in 1742 near Newburgh in Fifeshire. He was son of a farmer. He was educated at Newburgh and Abernethy, and was at first intended for a farmer; but when he was about sixteen he decided to become a minister among the 'Seceders,' a body to which his father belonged, and which had separated from the established kirk in 1732. This plan he relinquished in consequence of his having given some trifling offence to his co-religionists, and for some time subsequently led a desultory life, without any definite and continuous employment. He was for four years tutor in a gentleman's family, carried on his studies both at Edinburgh and Glasgow while supporting himself by teaching private pupils, and travelled abroad for about a year with the eldest son of the Earl of Leven and Melville. He translated the first three books of Robert Simson's 'Conic Sections,' Edinburgh, 1775, and gave some attention to Greek, Latin, trigonometry, logic, metaphysics, and theology. At last, when thirty-five years old, he seriously adopted the medical profession, and in 1777 went to London to prosecute his studies, although he was invited to become a candidate for the professorship of logic and rhetoric at the university of St. Andrews. In London he attended the lectures of Cruikshank and the two Hunters in Great Windmill Street. In 1778 he was, through the interest of Lord Leven, appointed surgeon to the 83rd or Glasgow regiment, which he accompanied to Jersey. Here he remained till 1783, when the regiment was disbanded. He performed his duties with great zeal and ability, and with 'a rigid probity' that occasionally involved him in disputes with his commanding officers. In 1782 he graduated M.D. at Edinburgh, with an inaugural dissertation, 'De Militum Salute tuenda.' In the next year he settled in London, on the suggestion and under the auspices of Dr. David Pitcairn, who was at that time physician to St. Bartholomew's Hospital. He at first intended to practise surgery, and was admitted to the London College of Surgeons in January 1784; but he afterwards became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians (September 1788). For the first seventeen or eighteen years of his life in London he was known almost exclusively as a successful teacher of anatomy. His anatomical school was in Thavies Inn, Holborn, where he settled in 1785, and built a dissecting-room. It was at first intended that Marshal's lectures should form part of a scheme (suggested by Dr. Pitcairn) for establishing a kind of school of physic and surgery for the pupils of St. Bartholomew's Hospital; but this plan was, to his disappointment, given up, and he lectured on his own account. Both his figure and his voice were against him; but he was so thoroughly acquainted with his subject that the matter of his lectures was excellent, and 'the whole was given with a constant reference to the infinite wisdom of the contrivance exhibited in the structure, so as to form the finest system of natural theology.' In 1800 he gave up his lectures on account of his health, and devoted himself entirely to medical practice, which he had before neglected. He died, after much suffering, at Bartlett's Buildings, Holborn, 4 April 1813. He was unmarried. He was always of an unsocial temper, and in his later years was very much alone. He left behind him numerous papers and memorandum-books, which were entrusted to the care of Solomon Sawrey, who had been his assistant in preparing his lectures. He had also a valuable anatomical museum, of which a detailed catalogue raisonne was being prepared at the time of his death. The only papers that were found to be fit for publication were edited by Sawrey, London, 8vo, 1815, with the title, 'The Morbid Anatomy of the Brain, in Mania and Hydrophobia; with the Pathology of these two Diseases.' The book, which furnishes much valuable information, derived from accurate observation, contains four parts : I. 'That Water in the Pericardium and Ventricles of the Brain is an Effect and Evidence of Disease.' II. 'On Canine Madness.' III. ' Morbid Anatomy of the Brain in Mania,' IV. 'Observations on the Nature of Mania.'\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Greenhill, William Alexander (1893). \"Marshal, Andrew\".

        "content": "Mount Margaret, also known as Primrose Ridge, is a 5,059-foot (1,542-metre) summit in Alaska, United States.\n\n\n== Description ==\nMount Margaret is located in the Alaska Range and in Denali National Park and Preserve. It is situated 11 miles (18 km) west of Mount Healy at miles 14–20 of the Park Road which traverses the mountain's southern slope. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains west into the Sanctuary River and east into Savage River, which are both tributaries of the Teklanika River. Topographic relief is modest as the summit rises 2,550 feet (780 meters) above the Savage River Canyon in two miles (3.2 km).\n\n\n== Climate ==\nBased on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Margaret is located in a tundra climate zone with long, cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Winter temperatures can drop below −20 °F with wind chill factors below −30 °F. The months May through June offer the most favorable weather for climbing or viewing.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe mountain's toponym has been officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names as reported, and perhaps given, by surveyor Woodbury Abbey on his 1921 survey of the boundaries of McKinley National Park. The name honors Margaret Murie (1902–2003), naturalist, writer, conservationist, and one of the most significant figures in Alaska history.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mountains and mountain ranges of Denali National Park and Preserve\nGeology of Alaska\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWeather forecast: Primrose Ridge\nNational Park Service site: The Mystery of Mount Margaret",

        "content": "National Mang-Hyang Cemetery (Korean: 국립망향의동산; Hanja: 國立望鄕의동산) is a cemetery in Seonggeo-eup, Seobuk-gu, Cheonan, South Chungcheong Province, South Korea. The cemetery is largely devoted to interring the remains of members of the Korean diaspora.\n\n\n== Description ==\nIt was founded on October 2, 1976. It was first conceptualized by the organization Mindan, which represents Zainichi Koreans (pre-1945 Koreans in Japan and their descendents) that are aligned with South Korea (by contrast, Chongryon is meant for Zainichis aligned with North Korea). Mindan submitted a petition to create such a cemetery to the South Korean government, and the government accepted the petition. The first burial was conducted on October 10, 1976. The total land area of the cemetery proper is 51,485 m2 (554,180 sq ft), and there is space for 7,680 graves.\nThe cemetery was initially meant to hold the remains of Zainichi Koreans. Since then, its scope has expanded to include all members of the Korean diaspora. It became a national cemetery in 2013.\nPeople over 70 years old can apply to reserve a spot in the cemetery. According to the official website, applicants must meet at least one of the following conditions:\n\nKoreans (with living relatives at time of burial, and have reserved a plot in advance, who hold or formerly held South Korean nationality) who have been residing overseas before December 31, 1988.\nDirect descendents of pre-1945 Korean emigrants, who were born overseas (with living relatives at time of burial and have reserved a plot in advance).\nOthers who have received approval from the Minister of Health and Welfare.\nSpouses of people who meet any of the above qualifications.\nFor people who have already died, efforts can be made by other people to repatriate their remains. However, this process can be complicated if the deceased has no known living relatives. In some cases, companies such as Nippon Kokan or Nippon Light Metal, which benefitted from the forced labor of Koreans during the colonial period, have reportedly refused to provide records on Koreans that could help in locating their relatives. In other instances, local Japanese governments have assisted in locating relatives.\nEach year, a memorial ceremony is held in the cemetery on October 2. There are various memorials for Koreans whose remains are now lost. In August 2018, a monument was established in honor of comfort women, the term for sex slaves of Japan during World War II.\nNumerous groups in the Korean diaspora are represented in the cemetery. It holds memorials for those who remains were lost or destroyed during World War II. It has a memorial for the passengers of Korean Air Lines Flight 007, who were shot down by the Soviet Union over Sakhalin on September 1, 1983.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHomepage (in English; also available in Korean, Russian, and Chinese)\n1976년 망향의 동산 준공(Completion of National Mang-Hyang Cemetery in 1976) on YouTube – a Korean News broadcast of the cemetery's inauguration (in Korean)",

        "content": "John Maplet (1612? – 4 August 1670) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMaplet probably born in 1612 in the parish of St. Martin-le-Grand, London, was son, according to Wood, of 'a sufficient shoemaker.' According to the 'Register of the Parliamentary Visitors to Oxford' (ed. Burrows, p. 488) he was twenty in 1632. He was educated at Westminster, whence in 1630 he was elected to Christ Church, Oxford. He graduated B.A. on 8 July 1634, MA. on 17 April 1638, and M.D. 24 July 1647. On 9 December 1643 he was elected junior proctor upon the death of William Cartwright, and served for the remainder of the year; and in the autumn of 1647 he was nominated principal of Gloucester Hall, now Worcester College. He was a delegate of the university appointed to receive the parliamentary visitors, and is said to have submitted to their authority. But he quickly left the university. About 1648 he became tutor to Lucius Gary, third lord Falkland, with whom he travelled in France for two years, staying chiefly at Orleans, Blois, and Saumur. During the tour he made many observations, which he committed to writing, 'in a neat and curious hand, with a particular tract of his travels in an elegant Latin style' (Guidott). He afterwards went to Holland and the Low Countries, where an uncle seems to have resided. On 5 March 1651 it was certified to the committee for reformation of the universities that he was ' absent upon leave' (Burrows, p. 329), but while still abroad he appears to have been ejected from his offices at Oxford. On his return he settled as a physician at Bath, practising there in the summer and at Bristol in the winter 'with great respect and veneration from all people in those parts.' He was acquainted with the Thomas Guidott physicians of his time, and helped Guidott in his early days. At the Restoration he resumed the principalship of Gloucester Hall, but retired in 1662. He died at Bath on 4 August 1670, aged 55; his wife died in the following February. In the north aisle of Bath Abbey, where they were buried, an elaborate monument, with a black marble tablet with a Latin inscription to Maplet's memory, was erected by Guidott. Under it is another small tablet with an inscription to his wife, aged 35, and his children, a son John, aged three years, and a daughter Mary, aged three months. Of Maplet Guidott says: 'He was of a tender, brittle constitution, inclining to feminine, clear skinn'd and of a very fresh complexion.' Wood says 'he was learned, candid, and ingenious, a good physician, a better Christian, and an excellent Latin poet.'\nBesides 'Familiar Epistles,' Maplet left in manuscript 'Mercurial Epistles,' 'Consultation with Dr. Edmund Meara, Dr. Samuel Bave, and others,' 'Cosmetics,' the 'Treatise of his Travels into the Low Countries and France,' and 'Poems and Epitaphs on Several Occasions and Persons ' (in the Oxford collection), all in Latin. In 1694 Guidott published in quarto Maplet's 'Epistolarum Medicarum Specimen de Thermarum Bathoniensium Eftectis,' which was dedicated to the leading contemporary physicians. Guidott also preserves some Latin verses by him on catarrh in the eyes, some lines headed 'De Catarrhi Fuga' and 'In Primum Canitiem,' with a rhymed translation of the latter. He considers his patron's style terse and his words choice, but his periods a little too elaborate.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Norgate, Gerald le Grys (1893). \"Maplet, John (1612?-1670)\".

It was written and recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic, and produced by the band and Richie Kennedy. The album received positive reviews from critics.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nInterplay received a score of 78 out of 100 on review aggregator Metacritic based on 12 critics' reviews, indicating \"generally favorable\" reception. Uncut stated that on \"Yesterday Is Only a Song\" as well as \"on the best tunes of Interplay, Ride feel wonderfully, unexpectedly, younger than yesterday\", while Mojo found it to be \"overall: troubled, unflinching, but tuneful and triumphant\".\nRobin Murray of Clash called it \"perhaps the best album yet of their mighty second arc\" as they \"embrace and move past their illustrious past, resulting in one of the most finessed, intriguing albums of their career to date\". Under the Radar's Dom Gourlay described it as \"the masterpiece Ride have been promising since getting back together. The jewel in an already impressive crown, but one that further illustrates Ride as a band looking forwards for inspiration instead of the nostalgia favored by many of their peers\". Reviewing the album for Glide Magazine, Doug Collette opined that it is \"either a testament to their bond as a band or a flagrant demonstration of an egregious lack of imagination\" and observed that it is \"difficult to distinguish individual instruments within the ever-so-dense mix of Interplay\".\nAllMusic's Fred Thomas said that \"one of the more notable shifts on the album is how the songwriting looks more to the influence of '80s synth pop than ever before\" but felt that it \"land[s] more like a collection of ideas being fleshed out than a cohesive album experience\". Ben Cardew of Pitchfork commented that \"ironically, the shoegaze revivalists often sound considerably more attached to classic Ride than Ride themselves do these days\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nRide\n\nAndy Bell – production, arrangements\nLaurence Colbert – production, arrangements\nMark Gardener – production, arrangements\nSteve Queralt – production, arrangements\nTechnical\n\nRichie Kennedy – production\nJohn Davis – mastering\nClaudius Mittendorfer – mixing\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Chariessa catalina can be distinguished from Chariessa elegans by an elytra that is closer to blue than black, and a forebody that is closer to crimson than C. elegans' diluted-blood red. C. catalina and C. elegans share a range in the southwestern corner of the continent but the range of C. elegans extends north toward the U.S.-Canadian border. This species seems to be most often encountered in March. The type specimen was collected in the Catalina Mountains of Arizona in 1969.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Czerwińsk Floating Bridge over the Vistula was a temporary floating bridge used by the forces of the Kingdom of Poland during the summer campaign of 1410 in the Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War.\nAccounts of its use are found in the anonymous Chronicle of the Conflict and in the Annals of Jan Długosz, where it is referred to as a \"bridge on boats\". The construction was prepared secretly during the winter and spring of 1410, floated down the Vistula, and assembled above Czerwińsk on June 30, enabling Polish units to efficiently and swiftly cross the river within three days. Afterwards, the bridge was dismantled and floated to Płock. It was reused at the end of September 1410 near Przypust, where Polish forces were crossing back from Prussia.\nThis structure provided a faster crossing of the Vistula, which came as a surprise to the Teutonic command and facilitated the concentration of Polish-Lithuanian forces at Czerwińsk. This had a significant impact on the further course of the campaign, and thus on the Battle of Grunwald. The idea of using such a construction, as well as its execution and efficient use, is considered a major success of contemporary Polish military engineering.\n\n\n== Bridge type ==\nThis structure is variously referred to as a pontoon bridge in different works, which according to Professor Barbara Rymsza from the Research Institute of Roads and Bridges in Warsaw, is not a precise term. It should be used for bridges based on boats (pontoons) transported to the crossing site over land. However, in situations where boats are towed or floated down the river to the assembly site, as in the construction of 1410, the term \"floating bridge\" should be used.\n\n\n== Reason of construction ==\nThe decision to build the bridge was made in early December 1409 during a council meeting in Brześć Kujawski attended by King Władysław Jagiełło, Grand Duke Vytautas, and their closest advisors. It resulted from the choice of Czerwińsk as the concentration point for the Polish-Lithuanian forces. The bridge was intended to facilitate the crossing of the Vistula river by the banners of the Kingdom of Poland, coming from the west (from Greater Poland) and the south (Lesser Poland and Red Ruthenia), as well as reinforcements from the Masovian dukes. Subsequently, on the northern bank of the river, these units would join forces with the troops of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, marching from the east from the direction of Pułtusk after crossing the Narew river. Furthermore, the use of this construction in Czerwińsk allowed for keeping the Teutonic Order commanders uncertain about the main direction of the Polish-Lithuanian army's attack, which was aimed at Malbork, in order to lead to a decisive battle.\n\n\n== Preparations ==\nThe elements of the crossing were clandestinely prepared during the winter and spring months of 1410, upstream of the Vistula river, near Kozienice, close to the Radom Forest, from which materials for construction were obtained. The supervision of the works was carried out by the Radom starosta, Dobrogost Czarny of Odrzywołek, of the Nałęcz coat of arms. The direct executor of the task was the master carpenter Jarosław, about whom little else is known, although he may have been identical to Jarosław, who received royal privilege on 14 February 1410, to build a mill and sawmill on the Wieprz river near Krasnystaw.\nThe choice of Kozienice as the place of work was due to the proximity of the forest and the fact that it was one of the last major settlements on the Vistula river, close to the area of military concentration, which was not located within the territory of the Duchy of Masovia. Most likely, the work was carried out by peasants from the starosta's estate under the direction of town craftsmen. The expenses were covered by the king.\n\n\n== Usage ==\nAccording to the plan, the bridge was floated down the Vistula river, most likely on 29 June 1410. It was assembled in just half a day on June 30. It was set up somewhere above the Czerwińsk monastery, although it is currently difficult to precisely locate this place (it may have been along the Kromnów – Zdziarka or Kromnów – Czerwińsk line).\nAccording to the accounts in the Chronicle of the Conflict and in the Annals of Jan Długosz, the crossing of the Polish forces with their accompanying baggage, artillery, and other military equipment began on the same day and proceeded without any incidents over the following days until July 2. On June 30, the king and most of the troops from Lesser Poland found themselves on the northern bank of the Vistula, where they set up camp. It took the following days for the remaining Polish units, gradually arriving at the concentration area, to join them. The crossing itself proceeded in good, orderly fashion – as Długosz reports, selected knights guarded the entrances to the bridge to prevent confusion and crowding, and the exits were also secured with massive beams, which prevented deviation from the designated path. A guide accompanied each unit. It appears that priority in using the bridge was given to baggage trains and artillery, while some cavalry units may have swum across the river due to the low water level that summer.\nIt is unknown who supervised the floating of the structure, as well as its assembly and the crossing itself. Regarding the latter task, Długosz emphasized the role of the king, a view endorsed by Stefan Maria Kuczyński, highlighting the monarch's involvement down to the smallest details, supported by a later mention in a Teutonic document from 1412 regarding Jagiełło's role in directing the construction of the castle in Veliuona. However, it is difficult to imagine that the king personally directed everything without the assistance of others.\nThe crossing was completed without technical damage or major disruptions by several tens of thousands of troops, along with artillery, baggage trains, and camp followers. Their exact number is difficult to determine, with various estimates presented in scholarly literature – 18,000 cavalry, 4,000 infantry, 30 cannons, and 8,000 wagons; 18,000 cavalry and 2,000 infantry; 25,000 cavalry, 4,000 infantry, and 8,000–9,000 wagons; approximately 20,000 cavalry and an indeterminate number of camp followers. As for the size of the baggage train, Andrzej Nadolski critically assessed estimates ranging from 8,000 to 11,000 wagons, based on the assumption that each lance fournie had at least one wagon, in addition to vehicles from royal cities for transporting cannons, ammunition, and provisions. In his opinion, such calculations should be significantly reduced based on specific examples from slightly later times (e.g., the known size of the Polish baggage train at the Battle of Chojnice), and it can be assumed that in the Polish army in 1410, one wagon was assigned to every 5–6 combatants.\nAfter the crossing, the bridge was dismantled and floated to Płock to be reused later. This occurred at the end of September 1410, when the Polish army was returning from Prussia. After the conclusion of the campaign in the Dobrzyń Land, the king with court retinue, baggage train, urban contingents, and part of the levy of knights stood on September 25 on the Vistula near Przypust (near Aleksandrów Kujawski). There, the bridge was set up again, although this time assembly encountered previously unknown technical difficulties. As a result, the crossing took place only after two days, on September 27.\nThe further fate of the structure remains unknown. It has been suggested that parts of it were used during subsequent wars with the Teutonic Order, when other crossings were established on the Vistula (near Zakroczym in 1414, Czerwińsk in 1422, or Nieszawa in 1454). However, this seems unlikely, as the elements of the bridge would have required special maintenance.\n\n\n== Construction ==\n\nThe exact details of the bridge construction did not survive, likely due to keeping its construction secret. In the Chronicle of the Conflict, it was described briefly, emphasizing only the uniqueness of the construction and the fact that no injuries occurred during the crossing. Długosz provided slightly more details about this bridge. Based on his account, attempts have been made to reconstruct the dimensions of the structure, yielding various results.\nApproximately 500 nine-meter-long beams and 2,500 3.5-meter-long planks were estimated to have been used for assembling the bridge, along with 168 to 200 boats, likely flat-bottomed and spindle-shaped, stable, with lengths of 8–12 meters and widths of 2–3 meters, on which the construction was to be supported. For this purpose, about 500 m³ of wood from selected trees of high structural quality were used. Additionally, a large quantity of anchor ropes was twisted. The floating likely occurred partially assembled, in the form of catamarans. The number of spans could have reached 80.\nThe bridge was approximately 500 meters long, as this was the width of the Vistula river in the vicinity of Czerwińsk. However, it is possible that it was shorter, which could have been due to the terrain around the river, the presence of the Kępa Śladowska island, and numerous sandbars that could have been used for the crossing (there might have been several sections of the bridge between these islands and the shore). Its width was probably around 2.4 meters, and the bridge was covered with fascine and a layer of earth fill, without railings.\n\n\n== Significance ==\n\nThe Czerwińsk Floating Bridge facilitated a swift crossing of the Vistula river, accelerating the concentration of Polish and Lithuanian forces. After crossing the river at this point, they could strike at the lands of Dobrzyń, Chełmno, and Pomesania, heading towards Malbork. The threat to the heart of the Teutonic Order itself forced the Knights to accept battle in open field, leading to the Battle of Grunwald. Additionally, the speed of the crossing surprised the Teutonic leadership, as evidenced by mentions of it in their correspondence.\nHowever, it is difficult to determine the extent to which the construction itself was extraordinary. Długosz presented in his Annals an account of a meeting in Toruń (July 3) between the Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen and Dobiesław Skoraczewski, a Polish knight serving the Hungarian envoys, Stibor of Stiboricz, and Mikołaj Gara. They sent him to the Polish camp, where he was on June 30. According to the chronicler, the Grand Master did not believe in the rapid crossing of the Vistula by the enemy, citing reports from his scouts that the Polish forces were on the river but unable to cross it. Moreover, he treated the stories about the bridge as unserious, claiming he was informed of its construction in the air. When Skoraczewski, who had seen the structure, began to explain its actual appearance, Jungingen dismissed his words as lies or too biased assessment of the power of the King of Poland due to the origin of the interlocutor. It is possible that this account is not reliable but rather the result of deliberate, biased portrayal of the Grand Master in the chronicle as arrogant and full of pride, disdainful of the opponent. It is also possible that the Grand Master quickly learned about the bridge and crossing, and the conversation with the Polish knight confirmed the information he had received earlier.\nBoth the Chronicle of the Conflict and Długosz's account describe the bridge at Czerwińsk as a novelty, previously unseen in Poland. In Polish scholarly literature, this construction is considered a bold and innovative solution, a spectacular success of contemporary military engineering, particularly in terms of assembly speed and the length of the bridge. It is also acknowledged as the first Polish bridge for which a written account of its operation has been preserved.\nFloating bridges were not entirely uncommon in medieval Europe. Such structures were known at least since the late 11th century; for example, they were used to connect the banks of the Nogat river. Additionally, in the summer campaign of 1410, a similar bridge was assembled on the Narew river near Pułtusk for the crossing of Lithuanian forces. Descriptions of such technical solutions also appear in treatises on the art of war from that era. Chronologically closest to the Great War with the Teutonic Order was Conrad Kyeser's Bellifortis, a work completed around 1405, richly illustrated, where both in the description and in the miniature, a floating bridge is depicted, which may resemble the one at Czerwińsk.\n\n\n== Commemoration ==\nIn January 2010, on the occasion of the 600th anniversary of the Battle of Grunwald, there was an idea to create a replica of the bridge to commemorate this object and popularize knowledge about it. Work began at the Warsaw Institute of Roads and Bridges under the direction of Professor Barbara Rymsza. Due to the navigability of the Vistula river, the construction of a full-size replica was not considered. Initially, it was planned to build a pier in the shape of a horseshoe, with two sides resembling modern military bridges, and one side being a reconstruction of two spans of the 1410 bridge. Engineering units of the Polish Army were supposed to be involved in the construction, but this did not succeed due to the need to fight floods in May and June 2010. Ultimately, with the involvement of local authorities, a bridge-building company from Warsaw, assistance from the Polish House in Pułtusk, and the Volunteer Fire Brigade from Nowy Dwór Mazowiecki, a replica consisting of a span supported on boats and a shore span with horse beams was built. It was ceremoniously unveiled on 26 June 2010, as part of the 600th anniversary celebrations of the Battle of Grunwald in Czerwińsk, combined with the historical picnic Through Czerwińsk to Grunwald. It was only a temporary attraction and was dismantled after three days.\n\nMeanwhile, in Kozienice, in the palace-park complex, there is a multi-figure monument commemorating the construction of the bridge along with a replica of its fragment. Erected on a small hill, the monument depicts Władysław Jagiełło on horseback, whose bridle is held by Zbigniew Oleśnicki (the royal secretary during the Great War), while the starosta Dobrogost Czarny presents the monarch with plans for the construction of the bridge. Below, there is a figure of Master Jarosław bowing to the ruler, with carpenters and blacksmiths at work behind him. Behind them is a replica of two spans of the bridge. The monument was unveiled on 19 June 2010, as part of the Kozienice celebrations of the 600th anniversary of the Battle of Grunwald.\n\tMemorial in Kozienice – Construction of the Floating Bridge\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDzikowski, Tadeusz (2010). \"Wpływ inżynierii wojskowej na wiktorię grunwaldzką\".

        "content": "Good Day for Living is the tenth studio album by American country music artist Joe Nichols. It was released on February 11, 2022, via Quartz Hill. Three singles have been released from the album, including its title track, which became Nichols' first top 20 hit on the Billboard Country Airplay chart since 2014.\n\n\n== Content ==\nThe 13-track album was co-produced by longtime collaborators Mickey Jack Cones and Derek George, who previously worked with Nichols on his 2013 album, Crickets.  Good Day for Living was recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic, which allowed Nichols to take his time with the record while on a break from touring: \"For the first time in a long time, I didn't feel any pressure. I'm the type of person who's always striving for more, but I've reached a place where I'm grateful for everything I've accomplished so far. It's been such a good run. I feel at peace, and that has freed me up to make new music that's very honest\". It marked his first release under Quartz Hill Records, and Nichols credited label head Benny Brown for his intuition on some of the song selection for the record.\n\"Home Run\" was released as the album's lead single on May 10, 2021, and was a major influence in Nichols' initial decision to sign to Quartz Hill. \"Good Day for Living\" and \"Brokenhearted\" were issued as the album's second and third singles, respectively, and both charted on the Billboard Country Airplay chart, with the former becoming a top 20 hit.\nThe album includes a collaboration with Blake Shelton on \"I Got Friends That Do\". It also features several songs previously recorded by other artists: \"She Was\" by Mark Chesnutt for his 2002 self-titled album, \"Hawaii on Me\" by Chris Janson for his 2019 album, Real Friends, and \"Reckon\" and \"Why Can't She\" by Adam Craig in 2016 and 2018, respectively.\nNichols toured in support of the album on the Good Day for Living 2022 Tour, which commenced on February 12 in Jackson, Mississippi, and ended in September after 26 dates.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nMatt Bjorke of Roughstock spoke favorably of the album's melodies and production choices, and highlighted the diversity in material across the project, while comparing Nichols' vocals at times to Ronnie Milsap and Gene Watson.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 1998 Connecticut Secretary of the State election took place on November 3, 1998, to elect the Secretary of the State of Connecticut. Incumbent Democrat Miles S. Rapoport did not seek re-election to a second term, instead opting to run for the open CT-01 seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.\nDemocratic nominee and state representative from the 100th district Susan Bysiewicz defeated Republican nominee Ben Andrews.\n\n\n== Democratic primary ==\n\n\n=== Candidates ===\n\n\n==== Nominee ====\nSusan Bysiewicz, attorney and state representative from the 100th district (1993–1999)\n\n\n==== Eliminated in primary ====\nEllen Scalettar, state representative from the 114th district (1993–1999)\n\n\n=== Convention ===\nThe Democratic statewide nominating convention was held on July 19, 1998.\nThe convention was a competitive race between two state representatives, Ellen Scalleter from the 114th district and \nSusan Bysiewicz from the 100th district. According to NYT, \"Ms. Bysiewicz's aides swarmed the convention floor in headsets and sunny yellow T-shirts today, while Ms. Scalletar treated delegates to dessert and breakfast, ran a shuttle bus and decorated the area around the convention with bouquets of lilies and life-size cardboard cutouts of herself.\"\nScaletter won the party's endorsement with 58% of the vote to Bysiewicz's 42%. Bysiewicz pledged to her supporters that she would continue her campaign into the primary race in September. After the convention, Scaletter met with Bysiewicz but failed to convince her to avoid a potentially expensive primary race.\n\n\n=== Results ===\nThe Democratic primary was held on September 18, 1998. Susan Bysiewicz narrowly defeated sate party-endorsed Ellen Scaletter in an upset.\n\n* Indicates party endorsement\n\n\n== Republican primary ==\n\n\n=== Candidates ===\n\n\n==== Nominee ====\nBen Andrews, former president of the Connecticut chapter of the NAACP and candidate for state representative from the 1st district in 1978\n\n\n== Third-party candidates and independent candidates ==\n\n\n=== Libertarian Party ===\n\n\n==== Nominee ====\nKenneth F.

The investigation determined that he had bribed former state treasurer, Paul J. Silvester, by directing $750,000 of a $1.5 million consulting fee in exchange for Silvester's investment of $150 million in pension money in a private equity fund, Landmark Partners, based in Simsbury. \nAndrews was also convicted of lying to federal agents and of conspiracy to launder money. He continued to maintain his innocence up until his sentencing to 30 months in federal prison in 2005. He began his sentence in 2007 and was released in 2009.\n\n\n== References ==",
