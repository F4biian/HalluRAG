        "content": "Crateva tapia, commonly known as toco, payaguá, naranjuelo, or beach apple, is a member of the genus Crateva, belonging to the family Capparaceae. It is native from Mexico through Central America into South America as far as south Brazil.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThey are trees or shrubs, reaching a size of 2–25 m in height, with a crown up to 20 m in diameter, bark opaque, light brown to grey, completely glabrous. Leaflets broad to narrowly elliptical to broadly ovate or obovate-elliptical, the lateral ones more or less obliquely asymmetrical, (3–) 8–13 (–18) cm long and 2–9 cm wide, apex long acuminate to rounded and abruptly acute, base cuneate to obtuse (or almost rounded) and gradual to abruptly attenuated towards the petiolules, glaucous or minutely papillose on the underside; petiolules very distinct, (4–) 6–10 mm long, petioles 5–15 cm long. Terminal inflorescences on the new leafy branches, flowers numbering 30–120, but only 10–20 bloom at the same time, raceme axes 6–16 cm long and 5–10 mm wide, bracts linear-lanceolate, up to 9 mm long, rapidly deciduous, pedicels 20–32 mm long; sepals lanceolate to oblong or ovate, acute, free part of the limb ca 5–9 mm long and 2–3 mm wide; petals 10–45 mm long and 3–7 mm wide, the blade 8–30 (–35) mm long and 3–7 (–13) mm wide, white to greenish white and when wilting cream, pink or pale purple, claw 5–11 mm long; stamens 14–20, filaments ca 35–46 mm long, tiny in pistillate flowers; gynophore 29–54 mm long or only up to 1–5 mm in staminate flowers. Infructescence of the leafy branches 6–18 cm long and 5–10 mm wide, the pedicel scars well spaced.\nThe fruit is a globular to oblong or ovoid berry, 4–9 cm long and 3.5–6.5 cm wide, turning yellow to orange or pink, pericarp 4–6 mm when immature and 1–2 mm when mature, filled with a fleshy pulp, gynophores 30–50 (–70) mm long and 3–4 mm wide, pedicels 20–60 mm long; seeds numerous, dark colored, 8–9 mm long, 6–7 mm wide and 3–4 mm thick. The pulp of sandy consistency is edible, with a sweet-sour taste.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nCrataeva tapia was described by Carl Linnaeus and published in Species Plantarum 1: 444. 1753.   \n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nCrataeva tapia is widely distributed from Mexico to south Brazil. It is a common species in dry forests and disturbed sandy soil areas, at all zones; at an altitude of 0–500 (–1000) m; fl (Dec–) Feb–Jun, fr Feb–Sep (Dec); a highly variable species . When growing in dry environments, it is very similar to C. palmeri with which it is apparently sympatric and possibly hybrid, but it is differentiated by the leaves or inflorescence axes being glabrous, the flowers white, and the leaflets pediculate.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Murdoch McKenzie (1743 – 27 January 1829) was a British Royal Navy commander and hydrographer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMcKenzie was born in 1743, was the nephew of Murdoch McKenzie the elder. He is said to have been a midshipman of the Dolphin in her voyage round the world under Commodore John Byron, 1764–6. In 1771 he succeeded his uncle as surveyor of the admiralty. In 1773 he was surveying the coast of Cornwall, in 1775 the coast of Kent, in 1779 the south coast of Devon. On 5 August 1779 he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in the navy, but the promotion made no difference in his work. In 1780 he surveyed the channel between the Isle of Sheppey and the mainland, an idea having been started that the Dutch might attempt to get again into the Medway by this passage. In 1781 he surveyed the Needles, at the request of the Trinity House, in order to determine the best way of protecting vessels from the rocks. About this time his eyesight began to fail, but he continued to act as chief surveyor of the admiralty till 1788. His charts were not published till 1804, and it does not appear that he had anything to do with that stage of the work. He was promoted to be commander on 31 January' 1814, and died on 27 January 1829, in his eighty-sixth year (Gent. Mag. 1829 pt. i. p. 188). He is described as of Minehead in Somerset. The confusion between the two hydrographers of the same name is almost inextricable, and the 'Treatise on Marine Surveying' is commonly attributed to the nephew.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1893). \"McKenzie, Murdoch (1743-1829)\".

Tongsiripaisri relinquished the franchise to an actress Anyarin Terathananpat in 2019.\nThe pageant was skipped once; in 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand, the national organizer was unable to organize the national event, and the country representative for the international tournament was appointed instead.\n\nWinner gallery\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Editions ==\nThe following table details Miss Grand Bangkok's annual editions since 2016.\n\n\n== National competition ==\nThe following is a list of Bangkok representatives who competed at the Miss Grand Thailand pageant.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Miss Grand Bangkok at Wikimedia Commons\nMiss Grand Thailand official website",

        "content": "Enoch Edgar Hume (March 24, 1844 – July 5, 1911) was an American physician and politician who served as mayor of Frankfort, Kentucky from 1905 to 1906. He also served as a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1875 to 1877. \n\n\n== Early life, education, and family ==\nEnoch Edgar Hume was born on his grandfathers farm in Trimble County, Kentucky. He was educated in the public schools of Louisville, Kentucky, and later attended Mount Washington Academy. At the outbreak of the American Civil War, he enlisted on the side of the confederacy, but was found by Union authorities, and sent to Camp Chase, a military prison in Ohio.  After the war, he traveled to Clearfield County, Pennsylvania, where he ran a logging camp. Upon his return to Kentucky, he began studying medicine at the University of Louisville and graduated in 1869. He married Mary South on December 19, 1877, in Frankfort, Kentucky. Together, they had one daughter and a son, Edgar Erskine Hume.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter graduating, Hume moved to Anderson County, Kentucky, where he practiced medicine for three years. While living in Anderson County, he was the roommate and friend of Champ Clark, future speaker of the United States House of Representatives. He then traveled to New York for further education. He studied at Bellevue Medical College and graduated in 1875. Upon his graduation, he was employed at the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital. During this time, he also worked at Columbia University's medical department.\nWhile in New York, the Democrats of Anderson County presented him as a candidate for the Kentucky House of Representatives, without him knowing. Upon his return to Kentucky, he won the election and represented Anderson County during the sessions of 1875, 1876, and 1877. At the end of his term, he declined a nomination for the Kentucky Senate.\nIn 1880, Hume moved to Frankfort, the capital of Kentucky, where he pursued the practice of medicine for over 30 years. During this time, he was the family physician for several of Kentucky's governors. He was the physician for governor William Goebel and one of 18 physicians who cared for him after he was shot by an assassin on January 30, 1900. Goebel died four days later.\nIn 1905, Hume was elected mayor of Frankfort. He served as mayor until 1909. During his time as mayor, he worked to establish new roads and sewers, and reduce the city's debt. In 1907, he called for all Kentucky teachers to meet at Mammoth Cave, and there they formed the Kentucky Educational Association. He was also a member of the board of trustees for the State Normal School for Colored Persons, and did much to improve education for African Americans within Kentucky. According to the Kentucky Historical Society's 1914 book Register of the Kentucky State Historical Society, Hume was greatly esteemed by the African Americans of Kentucky and was honored with a building named after him, along with a gold ring.\n\n\n== Later life and death ==\nOn account of failing health, Hume retired in 1909. His brother-in-law and associate John Glover South continued the business after Hume's retirement. Even after his retirement, his health continued to deteriorate, and during his last months, he only left his home once; to go vote for his friend James B. McCreary for governor. Hume died on July 5, 1911, at his home in Frankfort, at the age of 67. He was interred at Frankfort Cemetery in Frankfort.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Bop for Kerouac is a 1981 studio album by Mark Murphy.\nBop for Kerouac is the 18th recorded album by American jazz vocalist Mark Murphy. It was released by Muse in the United States in 1981 when Murphy was 49 years old. The release is a tribute to Beat writer Jack Kerouac and bebop. Murphy reads excerpts from two of Kerouac's works, The Subterraneans in \"Parker's Mood\" (track 3) and On the Road in \"Ballad of the Sad Young Men\" (track 8).\nMark Murphy recorded Bop for Kerouac in six hours on March 12, 1981, with producer and arranger Bill Mays and saxophonist Richie Cole. The album reflects Murphy's interest in the hip Beat Generation, Jack Kerouac, bebop, vocalese, mixing storytelling with music, ballads, and using the voice as a musical instrument for improvisation. Lyrical themes include isolation, loneliness, and bebop's masters. It includes quotes from Kerouac both on the album sleeve and in the tunes themselves. It was followed by a sequel, Kerouac Then and Now, released in 1989. Both albums were met with critical acclaim. Murphy was at his peak. As was typical with his Muse releases, he was paid a flat fee upfront and received no royalties.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn his book, This is Hip: The Life of Mark Murphy, author Peter Jones writes that \"With Bop for Kerouac, Mark Murphy showed that it was possible to be nostalgic for something that was far from mom and apple pie. In his celebration of the most liberal writer America has ever produced, Murphy offered an alternative vision of both the Fifties and the present\". Murphy had recorded bop and vocalese (words added to an instrumental soloist's improvisation) previously but this was a complete concept album dedicated to Jack Kerouac.\nWhen asked about his favorite personal recordings years later in an interview with Ted Pankin for Jazziz, Murphy said, \"We accomplished some rather remarkable things with Bop for Kerouac and the second Kerouac record. I was really responsible, I think, for bringing the Kerouac name back into the fore, because two years after my record came out, I noticed that the records started putting out Beat Generation stuff. Hmm! I was never given any credit for it, but anyway, that was my thought on it\".\n\nDan Ouellette, writing in a feature in DownBeat in 1997 singles out for praise Murphy's \"bold Kerouac projects\" in which Murphy \"unleashed a dazzling display of rambling, hip-daddy-o, stream-of-consciousness vocalese ... What started out as an experiment in capturing Kerouac’s spirit of wordplay turned into some of Murphy’s most organic, inspirational and spur-of-the- moment material\". Ouellette quotes Murphy: \"Basically I was looking for another way to do a bebop album. I never met Jack, and I never expected I’d become a Kerouacian, but I am one of the lucky people still alive who did see Lord Buckley perform...What really turned me on about this guy was that he wrote like an improvising musician...I really connected to him\". Murphy told James Gavin, \"Why should I do another be-bop album and leave out the man who re-created the bop era for us all\"?\n\n\n== Recording ==\nWorking on a tight budget and \"allotted with just six hours to do the entire project\", Bill Mays was hired to arrange, conduct and produce the recording by Joe Fields of Muse Records. Bill Mays said, \"I hate working that fast really. I mean, even to have just another six hours would take the pressure off ... But Mark was very well prepared. Before we went in, he and I rehearsed very thoroughly at my apartment, where I had a nice Steinway piano. Mark had me underscore the readings much like I might do in a film segment. We knocked out an awful lot of music in six hours.\"He hired Richie Cole and Bruce Forman. Mays said, \"The thing about that album that I'm proud of is that I had a small group, and I made it sound like a little big band, especially \"Boplicity\".\" Murphy had definite ideas about how he wanted each tune to go. Murphy was essentially the co-arranger on many of the tunes. Mays characterized Murphy as loose, go-with-the-flow, never getting angry. The day of the recording a film crew blew out the power, delaying the start of the recording and Richie Cole's car was hit in the parking lot. Even so they finished on time within the tight six hour schedule.\nThe album sleeve features short notes from beat poets Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Gregory Corso, as well as Steve Allen, publisher Jay Landesman, Kerouac biographer Lawrence Lee, and San Francisco club-owner Fred Kuh. In addition, a quotation from a 1959 Playboy article by Kerouac, \"The Origins of the Beat Generation\" is included.\nAuthor Peter Jones said that Murphy \"appreciated the freedom he had with Muse to pursue his own creative projects\". Murphy said, \"I never could have done Kerouac anywhere else\".\n\n\n== Touring ==\nMurphy tried out the entire album live at Le Café in Sherman Oaks. Murphy was happy with the reception. He said, \"But each night the one they roared for and sometimes stood for was the 8 minute track combining the last page of Kerouac's On the Road and the Landesman/Wolfe song (written for Jack's Beat Generation) \"The Ballad of the Sad Young Men\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\nOverall the critical reception to the album has been positive. Most reviewers find the album to be excellent, one of Murphy's essential recordings. The album helped establish Murphy as a bebop singer and forever associated him with the Beat lifestyle and to bebop music. Reviewer's find the Kerouac readings to be highly expressive and to blend perfectly with the associated tunes. Many of the recordings were popular in Murphy's live performances for the rest of his career.\nThe album was nominated for a 1982 Grammy award at the 25th annual Grammy awards for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Male, but lost to Mel Tormé for An Evening with George Shearing & Mel Tormé.\nIn his book, A Biographical Guide to the Great Jazz and Pop Singers, author Will Friedwald says that the recording is \"Murphy's most successful concept album\" and calls it \"extraordinary\". Friedwald calls Murphy a cultural critic and says this recording along with the later Kerouac, Then and Now to be his \"ultimate statement on literary and musical beatnikism...focusing on Kerouac as a pop culture hero, and dwelling on the music of Charlie Parker and his inner circle of bebop heroes, such as Charles Mingus and Sonny Rollins.\" Friedwald laments that the vocal versions of jazz instrumentals would have been better left wordless (tracks 2 and 5). He singles out the ballads and prose recitations as high points. He finds the final track \"The Ballad of the Sad Young Men\" with the Kerouac introduction to be \"stunningly perfect\".\nThe AllMusic entry written by Sott Yanow gives the album 4.5 stars saying, \"this poetry and jazz set works suprisingly well\". Yanow also includes the album in his list of best individual Muse sets by Mark Murphy in his book The Jazz Singers: The Ultimate Guide.\nThe Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music rates the release as excellent (4/5, meaning a high standard album from this artist and therefore highly recommended). \nAndrew Gilbert, writing for MusicHound Jazz, calls the album a \"highly effective jazz/literature project\".\nThe Penguin Guide to Jazz assigns 3 stars (meaning a good if middleweight set; one that lacks the stature or consistency of the finest records, but which is certainly rewarding on its own terms).\nJohn Swenson, in The Rolling Stone Jazz & Blues Album Guide, assigns the album 4 stars (excellent, representing peak performances in an artist's career, and providing the best introduction to an artist's work) and calls the recording \"an engaging mixture of bop standards interspersed with Kerouac readings\".\nStereo Review gives the album an Honorable Mention in its annual Record of the Year Awards for 1981, selected by editorial staff and critics. Chris Albertson writing a 1982 review of the album in Stereo Review calls it a contender for vocal album of the year and says he was \"overwhelmed\" by the results achieved by Murphy and Richie Cole and calls the blend of poetry and jazz \"perfect\".\nOwen Cordle, writing in DownBeat magazine in 1982 likens Richie Cole playing Bird (Charlie Parker) to Mark Murphy's Miles Davis, capturing a \"detached cool intensity\" in the bebop music. He gives the album a 5 star rating. He says that \"Boplicity\" \"slips in like the birth of the cool, deliberately laidback, smoldering under­neath\". Writing about the recordings of \"The Bad And The Beautiful\" and \"Ballad Of The Sad Young Men\" (with a reading from On The Road), Cordle says they \"become a cathartic ache in the heart as Murphy stretches his phrases nearly to the tensile limit of emotion, most like early Miles\".\nAuthor, singer, musician, and composer Peter Jones notes that \"Bop For Kerouac combines the sadness and the euphoria of the intertwined jazz and beatnik lifestyles that Murphy knew from the inside, but it isn't the crazed, ecstatic homage to bebop that one might expect...the overall tone is elegiac, and ballads dominate\".\nWriter James Gavin said, \"It remains, I think, his greatest achievement on record, and an album that I play to this day. It has all of the best of Mark and none of the worst of Mark.\" James Gavin calls the album \"one of the most moving vocal albums in jazz\". He finds the tracks with Kerouac readings highly evocative of the 1950s jazz club scene with Murphy an ideal storyteller to take you there. He singles out the Lester Young portrait in Joni Mitchell's lyrics to the Mingus tune \"Goodbye Pork Pie Hat\" and likens Richie Cole as the Young to Murphy's Billie Holiday. Commenting on the ballads, Gavin finds those recordings capture the loneliness of the Beat lifestyle and likens Murphy's Kerouac readings to Montgomery Clift in vocal expressivity. In an article for the Village Voice Gavin calls Bop for Kerouac a masterpiece with a \"gripping portrait of the '50's underworld\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Be-Bop Lives (Boplicity)\" (Miles Davis, Ray Passman, Holli Ross) – 6:39\n\"Goodbye Pork Pie Hat\" (Charles Mingus, Joni Mitchell) – 4:53\n\"Parker's Mood\" (Charlie Parker, King Pleasure) – 4:33\nIncludes a reading from The Subterraneans by Jack Kerouac\n\"You Better Go Now\" (Irvin Graham, Bickley Reichner) – 3:26\n\"You've Proven Your Point (Bongo Beep)\" (Charlie Parker) – 3:47\n\"The Bad and the Beautiful\" (David Raksin, Dory Previn) – 3:54\n\"Down St. Thomas Way\" (Sonny Rollins, Ray Passman, Herb Wasserman) – 5:06\n\"Ballad of the Sad Young Men\" (Tommy Wolf, Fran Landesman) – 7:37\nIncludes a reading from On the Road by Jack Kerouac\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nPerformance\nMark Murphy – vocals\nBob Magnusson – bass\nLuther Hughes – bass\nJeff Hamilton – drums\nRoy McCurdy – drums\nBill Mays – keyboards, arranger, conductor\nRichie Cole – alto saxophone, tenor saxophone\nBruce Forman – guitar\nMichael Spiro – percussion\nProduction\nJim Mooney – engineer\nBill Mays – producer\nJ.P. ‘‘Really Happy’’ Kuhn – cover\nCathleen W.

        "content": "William Mudge (1796 – 20 July 1837) was a British Royal Navy commander.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMudge was born in 1796. He was the third son of Major-general William Mudge. He was promoted to be lieutenant in the navy on 19 February 1815. In August 1821 he was appointed first lieutenant of the Barracouta, with Captain Cutfield, employed on the survey of the east coast of Africa under Captain William Fitzwilliam Owen. He was afterwards moved into the Leven under the immediate command of Owen, and on 4 October 1825 was promoted to the rank of commander. He was then appointed to conduct the survey of the coast of Ireland, on which he was employed till his death at Howth on 20 July 1837. He was buried with military honours in the ground of the cathedral at Howth on 24 July.\nIn addition to 'Sailing Directions for Dublin Bay and for the North Coast of Ireland,' which were officially published, 1842, Mudge contributed several papers (mostly hydrographic) to the 'Nautical Magazine;' and to the Society of Antiquaries, in November 1833, an interesting account of a prehistoric village found in a Donegal bog (Archæologia, xxvi. 261). He married in 1827 Mary Marinda, only child of William Rae of Blackheath, by whom he had a large family. He has been confused with his father (e.g. in Brit. Mus. Cat.), whose work, it will be seen, was entirely geodetic.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1886). \"Mudge, William (1796-1837)\".

He was apprenticed to his father, and then entered the office of C. Beazley. His first essays in art were landscape-paintings; but at the age of twenty he had begun to work as an architect. From 1799 to 1827 he exhibited designs of minor works at the Royal Academy, the most ambitious of which was a ‘Design for a Temple of Fame.’ In 1820–2 he designed the hall of the Leathersellers' Company in St. Helen's Place, and in 1827 the priory at Hornsey. The headquarters of the London militia, Bunhill Row, were designed by him; the Wesleyan Centenary Hall in Bishopsgate Street Within (1840); Christ Church, Virginia Water; and a great number of smaller works. Pocock died on 29 October 1849 in Trevor Terrace, Knightsbridge, London.\nHe published:\n\n‘Architectural Designs for Rustic Cottages,’ London, 1807, 4to; of which new editions were published in 1819 and 1823.\n‘Modern Finishings for Rooms,’ London, 1811, 4to; also republished in 1823.\n‘Designs for Churches and Chapels,’ London, 1819, 4to.\n‘Observations on Bond of Brickwork’ (1839), written for the Institute of British Architects, of which society he was an early member.\nHis son William Willmer Pocock was also an architwct.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1886). \"Pocock, William Fuller\".

        "content": "Myochroidea is a genus of lichen-forming fungi of uncertain familial placement in the order Lecanorales. It has four species of grey or brown-grey crustose lichens.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe genus was proposed in 2008 by the lichenologists Christian Printzen, Toby Spribille, and Tor Tønsberg, with Myochroidea rufofusca assigned as the type species. This lichen was first described as Biatora rufo-fusca by Martino Anzi in 1860. The name Myochroidea is derived from the Greek word myochrous, which translates to \"mouse-coloured.\" This naming is inspired by the characteristic grey or brown-grey colour of the lichen's body (thallus), reminiscent of the hues found in a mouse's fur.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe thallus of Myochroidea is crust-like and not clearly defined at its edges. It has a texture that can range from wart-like clusters to small, granule-like structures, especially noted in the species M. minutula. These granules are similar in appearance to tiny, angular cysts. The clusters (areoles) can vary in shape from slightly to prominently rounded, sometimes even resembling coral in their complexity. The surface of these lichens is non-glossy, with hues from mouse grey to greyish brown or olive brown, and harbours a trebouxioid (green algal) photobiont.\nThe reproductive structures (apothecia) of Myochroidea are reddish to blackish brown, and occasionally ochre, in colour. These structures are seated directly on the thallus and may range from flat to significantly rounded, maintaining a matte or slightly shiny appearance. These parts are either not covered in a powdery coating (pruina) or have such a coating so fine that it's only noticeable when moist. The edges of the apothecia are typically slightly raised compared to the central disc, though in older structures, the edges may not be as distinct. The supporting tissue (exciple) surrounding the reproductive discs is either colourless or a pale orange-brown, with the outermost layers blending in colour with the layer above the reproductive cells (epihymenium), composed of strongly gel-like, interweaving and branching fungal filaments. These filaments may be interspersed with small, colourless to pale yellow granules. The underlying tissue layers (hypothecium, subhymenium, and hymenium) are colourless, while the epihymenium may be a pale ochre to brown shade. The filaments (paraphyses) are branched and fuse together, with their tips often brown and slightly enlarged. The spore-producing structures (asci) contain eight spores each and react to iodine by turning dark blue. The spores themselves are simple in form, colourless, and range from spindle-shaped to broadly elliptical.\nThe structures typically responsible for asexual reproduction (pycnidia) have not been observed in this genus. Chemically, Myochroidea lichens may contain fatty acids, lobaric acid, and xanthones, though some species do not produce any detectable secondary metabolites.\n\n\n== Similar genera ==\nMyochroidea shows a superficial resemblance to the genera Biatora and Japewiella. Despite these surface similarities, these three genera can be distinguished from one another by differences in the structure of their spore-producing sacs (ascus type) and the tissue surrounding the reproductive structures (excipular anatomy). In Myochroidea, the exciple is characterised by densely interwoven fungal threads (hyphae) that have slightly thickened and pigmented ends. Contrastingly, in both Biatora and Japewiella, the hyphae within the exciple are set within a gel-like substance, a feature that is particularly prominent in Japewiella. Moreover, the presence of thickened and pigmented hyphae at the tips, as seen in Myochroidea, is not observed in Biatora.\nAdditionally, Myochroidea shares the Micarea-type ascus with both Helocarpon and the more recently described Xyleborus, according to Harris and Ladd's 2007 publication. However, Helocarpon is distinct due to its carbonised underlayer (hypothecium) and surrounding tissue (exciple), as well as its lack of thickening at the tips of the excipular hyphae. On the other hand, Xyleborus sets itself apart with a gelatinous exciple that features radiating, lightly branched hyphae and the unique presence of spore-producing structures (sporodochia).\n\n\n== Species ==\nMyochroidea leprosula (Arnold) Printzen, T.Sprib. & Tønsberg (2008)\nMyochroidea minutula Printzen, T.Sprib. & Tønsberg (2008)\nMyochroidea porphyrospoda (Anzi) Printzen, T.Sprib. & Tønsberg (2008)\nMyochroidea rufofusca (Anzi) Printzen, T.Sprib. & Tønsberg (2008)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "William Innes Pocock (June 1783 – 13 March 1836) was a British Royal Navy lieutenant, artist and writer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPocock was the second son of Nicholas Pocock, marine painter, and younger brother of Isaac Pocock, artist and dramatist. He was born at Bristol in June 1783. He entered the Royal Navy in 1795, served more especially in the East and West Indies, and from 1807 to 1810, in the St. Albans, made three several voyages to the Cape of Good Hope, St. Helena, and China. In the last of these the convoy was much shattered in a storm off the Cape of Good Hope, and was detained at St. Helena to refit. During this time Pocock made several sketches of the island, which, with some account of its history, he published as Five Views of the Island of St. Helena in 1815, when public interest was excited in the island as the residence allotted to Napoleon. On 1 Aug. 1811 Pocock was promoted to be lieutenant of the HMS Eagle, with Captain Charles Rowley, and in her saw much active boat-service in the Adriatic. She was paid off in 1814, and Pocock had no further employment afloat. He appears to have amused his leisure with reading, writing, and painting; he is described as a good linguist, and is said to have published in 1815 Naval Records: consisting of a series of Engravings from Original Designs by Nicholas Pocock, illustrative of the principal Engagements at Sea since the Commencement of the War in 1793, with an Account of each Action (Watt, Bibl. Brit.). There is no copy in the British Museum. He is also said to have written some pamphlets on naval subjects, none of which seem now accessible. He has been confused with William Fuller Pocock, architect and artist. He died at Reading on 13 March 1836. He was twice married, and left issue.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1886). \"Pocock, William Innes\".

        "content": "George Levy McMahon (June 18, 1904 – July 11, 1978) was a Canadian oil executive who was president of Pacific Petroleums from 1952 to 1961. He also served as president of the Calgary Stampeders and along with his brother, Frank McMahon, provided funding for the construction of McMahon Stadium.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMcMahon was born on June 18, 1904, to Francis J. and Stella (Soper) McMahon. He grew up in Moyie, British Columbia, and Spokane, Washington, and attended Gonzaga University and Whitworth College. In 1924, he earned a degree in business administration from the latter institution.\nFrom 1924 to 1926, McMahon worked in the metal department of the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company in Kimberley, British Columbia. He then worked for Pemberton and Son, a stock and bond brokerage based in Vancouver.\n\n\n== Business ==\nMcMahon's success as a broker provided the much of the money he and his brother needed to start their own oil well drilling business. They entered the oil business in 1930 and in 1939, founded Pacific Petroleum. In 1948, they drilled one of Alberta's first oil wells, Leduc No. 3. They were also among the first to develop the Turner Valley oil fields. In 1949, they started the Westcoast Transmission Company, which constructed the $200-million Westcoast Pipeline. McMahon served as president of Pacific Petroleum from 1952 to 1961. He then served as Pacific's vice chairman until his retirement.\nIn 1963, McMahon began construction on the Calgary Inn, a 12-story, 319-room hotel. He served as president of Calgary Inn Ldt. until 1968 and the hotel is now the Westin Hotel Calgary.\nMcMahon also served as a director of the National Trust Company, Phillips Petroleum Company, Canadian Atlantic Oil, Peace River Natural Gas Company, Charter Oil Company, and New Gas Exploration Company of Alberta.\n\n\n== Calgary Stampeders ==\nA longtime director of the Calgary Stampeders, McMahon was elected president of the team in December 1959. Under his leadership, the Stampeders went from a deficit of $2,066 in 1959 to surplus of $233,666 in 1967. In 1960, George and Frank McMahon put up the initial $300,000 towards the construction of a new football stadium in Calgary, which was named in their honor. McMahon stepped down in 1968 due to ill health and was replaced by Pat Mahoney.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMcMahon was a member of the Canadian Scottish Regiment and served in the 2nd Reserve Battalion of the British Columbia Regiment during World War II. In 1955, he was made an honorary colonel of the South Alberta Light Horse.\nMcMahon's first marriage ended in divorce in 1945. On March 21, 1946, he married Katherine Latimer Staples. They had three sons and three daughters.\nIn 1967, illness forced McMahon to live most of the year in The Bahamas. He died on July 11, 1978, at Calgary General Hospital.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Redditch Town Hall is a municipal building in Walter Stranz Square in Redditch, a town in Worcestershire, in England. It is the headquarters of Redditch Borough Council.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter significant population growth, largely associated with the needle and fishing tackle industries, a local board of health was formed in the area in 1858. After the local board of health was succeeded by Redditch Urban District Council in 1894, the new council adopted the old police station and magistrates' court in Evesham Street as its offices. The council later acquired a Victorian style house on the corner of Mount Pleasant and Salop Street: that building became known as The Council House although, after the council left, it was rebuilt and became known as Stoneleigh House.The Council House in Mount Pleasant continued to serve as the headquarters of the urban district council for much of the 20th century and remained a meeting place for the enlarged Redditch Borough Council which was formed in 1974. However, in the late 1970s, with the increasing responsibilities of the borough council, council leaders decided to commission a more substantial civic complex. The site they selected, on the southwest side of Alcester Street, was occupied by town's fire station.The new building was designed by Cassidy & Ashton Partners in partnership with Ove Arup & Partners, built in red brick with metal roofs and was completed in 1982. The design involved an asymmetrical main frontage erected around a courtyard facing onto Alcester Street which featured fountains and an octagonal kiosk with a pyramid-shaped roof. Internally, the principal room was the council chamber which was established in a single storey polygonal structure in the south east corner of the complex. The architectural historian, Nikolaus Pevsner, seemed unimpressed with some aspects of the design: he said that \"the building outstays its welcome by extending…along the southwest of Alcester Street.\"The town hall was the venue, in October 1984, for the annual Aneurin Bevan Memorial Lecture during which the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, Roy Hattersley, spoke about reducing unemployment and repatriating capital back to the UK.By 2020, much of the building's floorspace was disused, leading to calls for a major renovation project.  Civic leaders announced that the building would be extended, with a new entrance and reception area added, and it was confirmed that the town library, jobcentre and Citizens' Advice Bureau would all relocate to the building. It was also decided that the west wing would be converted to accommodate a National Health Service clinic, while the council chamber would move to the second floor. The first stage of the works, relating to the new clinic, was completed in October 2023, while construction work to implement the second stage of project, relating to the relocation of the council chamber, commenced on site in April 2024.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Movement for Progressive Change (MPC) is a political party in Liberia. \n\n\n== History ==\nThe MPC contested the 2011 presidential election. Their nominee was Simeon C. M. Freeman, alongside running mate Cyrus Cromah. After a failed referendum in August to shorten the residency requirements for presidential candidates, the MPC filed a legal challenge against six other presidential candidates, including incumbent president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, on grounds they were ineligible to run due to failing to meet the unchanged residency requirements. The case was dismissed by the Supreme Court of Liberia on October 5. Freeman received 5,559 votes, 0.5% of the total. In the legislature, the MPC won no seats in the Senate, but two in the House of Representatives. Numene T. H. Bartekwa was elected in the Grand Kru County #2 District and Alex Chersia Grant won in the Grand Gedeh County #3 District.\nThe MPC again unsuccessfully contested the Senate in the 2014 election.\nIn early 2016, Freeman fled the country. He was facing legal charges of treason by the Sirleaf government after he had claimed the government was involved with the death of businessman Harry Greaves. Freeman claimed that he himself was declared an enemy by the government. In June 2016, several MPC members left the party, joining the Alternative National Congress, due to the group's lack of confidence in the leadership of the MPC. The government dropped all charged against Freeman while he was out of the country. He returned to the country in December.\nIn the 2017 election, Freeman again contested the presidency, alongside running mate William T. Knowlden. According to Rodney Sieh of FrontPage Africa, Freeman was among the harshest critics of the Sirleaf government running, advocating a smaller government and a prioritization of the private sector as a means of economic growth. Freeman received 6,682 votes, 0.4% of the total. In the legislative elections, the MPC saw no victories in 2017. Rep. Grant won re-election under the Coalition for Democratic Change banner, and Jonathan Fonati Koffa won the Grand Kru County #2 District.\nBy September 30, 2020, Nimba County Senator Thomas Grupee switched party allegiance from the Unity Party to the MPC. In the Senate election that year, Senator Grupee was defeated for re-election by Jeremiah Koung. No MPC candidates were elected. By September 20, 2022, Q. Somah Paygai, who served as the running mate on the National Patriotic Party ticket in the 2005 presidential election had become a member of the MPC.\nIn May 2023, ahead of the presidential election that year, Freeman announced his running mate to be James Kollie Barclay. Freeman received 13,205 votes, 0.72% of the votes. The MPC again won no seats in the Senate. In the House, Isaac G. Bannie was elected to the Grand Bassa County #1 District.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Undercurrent is a 1998 American–Puerto Rican neo-noir crime film directed by Frank Kerr, starring Lorenzo Lamas, Brenda Strong and Frank Vincent. Lamas stars as a down-on-his-luck American living in Puerto Rico, who gets paid to frame a woman for adultery and finds himself dragged into a murder intrigue.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe creative principals behind Undercurrent have roots in the Boston area, and it was the first feature from Belmont-based producer Paul Boghosian after several documentaries. The film drew its inspiration from 1940s romantic thrillers, and shares its name with one such film from 1946. PRITCEFF (Puerto Rico Investors Tax Credit Enhanced Film Fund), an incentive program created by the Puerto Rican government, also lent its support to the project. It was supposed to be followed by a second Puerto Rican joint venture tentatively called Primal Rage, but that apparently did not eventuate.\nThe film was shot in Puerto Rico, where it is set, in the spring of 1997. Old San Juan, the capital city's historic district, was the main location and key scenes were shot at the former Carmelite convent turned luxury hotel, El Convento. Undercurrent was the first film collaboration for Denise Hajjar, a Boston fashion designer who had dressed local TV personalities. She traveled with the crew, and brought with her the pieces that made up Strong's wardrobe, which were taken from her recent collections. However, she selected the male characters' clothes from three different Puerto Rican boutiques to follow the mandate that each must have a distinct look.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Pre-release ===\nUndercurrent was initially intended by the producers for a premium cable premiere. The picture was screened on April 11, 1998, at a Latin American film festival hosted by the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, in presence of director Frank Kerr and producer Paul Boghosian. A theatrical premiere was also organized in Puerto Rico the following month.\n\n\n=== Release ===\nThe film premiered domestically on VHS and DVD through Lions Gate Entertainment via their Avalanche Home Entertainment label on July 27, 1999.\n\n\n=== Reception ===\nUndercurrent has received mixed reviews. In his book A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Film Noir, film historian John Grant praised the \"great cinematography of Puerto Rican coastal scenery\" and assessed that \"the screenplay has some interest, but Lamas' woodenness more or less dooms proceedings.\" In Ante el lente extranjero, an examination of foreign films shot in his country, Puerto Rican academic Luis Trelles Plazaola wrote that \"two acceptable action sequences, one at the beginning and one at the conclusion\" were to the film's credit, while the rest was \"a reiteration of common tropes, frequent nudity and scenes of simulated sex, with little conviction put into a story of betrayals and twists.\" He did acknowledge the performance of local actor Daniel Lugo, while judging that Lamas and Strong's pairing relied more on their sex appeal than on their performances. TV Guide wrote that \"[t]he doublecrosses are neatly woven into the fabric of this derivative crime picture, but neither screenwriter Wayne Behar nor director Frank Kerr can stay ahead of the jaded audience.\" However, it deemed that \"the chemistry between Lamas and Strong is striking\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nUndercurrent at IMDb \nUndercurrent at AllMovie",

The elections were boycotted by the Liberal Party, while the Serbian Progressive Party had dissolved itself prior to the elections. As a result, the People's Radical Party won all the seats. However, several members of the Liberals and Progressives were named amongst the appointees to the National Assembly.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nNikola Pašić was appointed president of the National Assembly and Dimitrije Katić as vice president.\nThe Radical Party's Đorđe Simić remained Prime Minister, but was dismissed by the king in October 1897 and replaced by Vladan Đorđević, who headed a cabinet whose members (with the exception of the Minister of War) were appointed by the king, largely composed of independents and Progressives, with a single Liberal. On 14 March 1898 the Assembly was dissolved, with the intention of holding new elections. A decree was issued on 18 April setting the election date as 23 May.\n\n\n== References ==",

With that in mind, the music created by The Defiant could very well be some of the best I’ve ever had a hand in making, as well as one of the most important and thoughtful musical experiences of my career. I am thrilled to be a part of it.”\n\n\n== Debut album (2023-present) ==\nThe band released their debut album \"If We're Really Being Honest\" on October 27, 2023, through Cranberry Bog Records, immediately followed by a string of promotional appearances on Timcast IRL and other television and internet programs.\nQuickly following the release of the record, the band announced a major US tour supporting Me First and the Gimme Gimmes in Spring of 2024.\nThe band performed their single Dead Language on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on April 3, 2024.\n\n\n=== Discography ===\n\n\n==== Albums ====\nIf We're Really Being Honest\n\n\n==== Singles ====\nWhere Did Lady Liberty Go?\nDead Language\nCan't Stop Crying\nEverybody Loves Me\n\n\n== References ==",

He lost his left leg in the Battle of Trafalgar.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nRivers was entered on board the Victory in May 1795. In her he went out to the Mediterranean, was slightly wounded in the action of 13 July 1795, was present in the Battle of Cape St. Vincent, 14 February 1797, and on the return of the Victory to England continued in her while she was employed as a depot for prisoners, till paid off in 1799. He again joined the Victory in 1803, when she went out to the Mediterranean as flagship of Lord Nelson, and, continuing in her, was present in the Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805, when he was severely wounded by a splinter in the mouth, and had his left leg shot off in the very beginning of the action. On 8 January 1806 he was promoted to be lieutenant of the Princess of Orange. He received a gratuity from the patriotic fund, and in 1816 was awarded a pension of five shillings a day for the loss of his leg. From April 1806 to January 1807 he served in the Otter sloop in the Channel, from April 1807 to October 1809 he was in the Cossack frigate, in which he was present at the reduction of Copenhagen in September 1807, and in the end of 1809 was in the Cretan off Flushing. For the following years, and till the peace, he served in successive guardships at the Nore. After many fruitless applications for employment, he was in November 1824 appointed warden at Woolwich dockyard, and in April 1826 to Greenwich Hospital. Here he remained for upwards of thirty years, during which time he took an active part in the administration and organisation of the hospital and many of the minor charities connected with it. He died in his rooms in the hospital on 5 December 1856. He married, in 1809, a niece of Joseph Gibson of Long Bennington, Lincolnshire, and had issue. A subscription bust by Thomas Milnes is in the Painted Hall at Greenwich.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1896). \"Rivers, William\".

The Peruvian troops were commanded by Captain EP Juan Chávez Valdivia and Ensign Oscar Mávila Ruiz. This event revived the need to reach an agreement, so on February 16, 1904, both parties agreed to continue the arbitration trial before the King of Spain.\nAnother armed incident occurred shortly after, this time in Torres Causana, on July 28, 1904, where once again the Peruvians rejected an Ecuadorian advance on their territory.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Nobles County Heritage Center, located in Worthington, Minnesota, is a cultural institution owned and operated by the Nobles County Historical Society, dedicated to preserving and sharing the history of Nobles County. Housed within the historic Worthington Armory, the Center serves as a repository for historical artifacts, documents, and archives.\n\n\n== Exhibits and Collections ==\nThe center offers a variety of exhibits that explore different aspects of the county's history as well as traveling exhibits focusing on state and national history. Visitors can learn about the early pioneers who settled the land, the agricultural heritage of the region, and the social and cultural development of Nobles County over time. The center's permanent and rotating exhibits showcase the extensive collection of artifacts, photographs, documents, and textiles donated to the Nobles County Historical Society.\n\n\n== Research ==\nThe center is also a resource for researchers interested in the local history of the community. Their collection comprises donations from local individuals, families, and businesses, including self-published family histories, biographies, genealogical documents, manuscripts, church records, marriage records, county records, and various other materials. The Society staff is available to assist researchers and answer questions about Nobles County's past.\n\n\n== Programs ==\nThe Center actively engages with the community through educational programs, lectures, and workshops. The center also serves as a venue for community events and gatherings.\n\n\n== Nobles County Historical Society ==\nThe Nobles County Historical Society (NCHS) originated from an Old Settlers Picnic held on Sept. 10, 1933, at the Chautauqua Pavilion in Worthington. Plans quickly unfolded to preserve and showcase historical articles and papers of significance. Initially, space in the courthouse was allocated to store and exhibit a few small artifacts, while others were scattered throughout the county, awaiting a permanent home.\nThe artifact collection shifted among different locations until 1962 when a museum was established in the lower level of the Nobles County Library. In 1996, the library underwent renovations, resulting in a 40% reduction in museum space. Despite the growing collection of artifacts, NCHS faced limitations in exhibiting them or offering programming to local residents.\nNCHS embarked on renovating the historic 100-year-old Worthington Armory building into the new Nobles County Heritage Center. The Armory has been restored and converted for use as a museum with modern updates. NCHS successfully relocated its offices to this new space in late 2021.\nThe Society also operates the Nobles County Pioneer Village, an outdoor living history museum that is open seasonally. It features a collection of historic buildings, including a one-room schoolhouse, a blacksmith shop, and a general store. Costumed interpreters demonstrate pioneer life skills and crafts, allowing visitors to experience a bygone era firsthand.\n\n\n== Worthington Armory ==\nThe armory was constructed in 1922. The architectural style is typically classified as Beaux Arts, reflecting a period of interest in classical Greek and Roman forms. The building served as a training facility for the National Guard for many decades and also played a role as a community center, hosting events and celebrations.\n\n\n== Transformation from Armory to Heritage Center ==\nIn the late 20th century, the National Guard no longer required the armory. Facing potential demolition, the Nobles County Historical Society stepped in. Recognizing the building's historical significance, the Society undertook a project to renovate the armory and transform it into the Nobles County Heritage Center. The renovations were completed in 2021, successfully preserving the historical character of the structure while incorporating modern updates to enhance accessibility and functionality.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Nobles County, Minnesota\nList of museums in Minnesota",

        "content": "Charles Quincy Goodhue (October 2, 1835 – March 21, 1910) was an American illustrator. Upon retiring as a marble-cutter in 1890, he began to sketch, from memory, scenes of 19th-century Portland, Maine, his hometown. His book, Portland Through Grandfather's Eyes, is now in the possession of the Maine Historical Society.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nGoodhue was born in Portland, Maine, in 1835, to Richard Shatswell Goodhue and Sarah Wendell Quincy. He was a twin with brother Henry Williams Goodhue.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nGoodhue found work as a marble-cutter at Enoch M. Thompson's Monument Works company on Portland's Preble Street, at its junction with Cumberland Street. He also worked as a firefighter.\nWhen he retired, in 1890, he began to sketch, from memory or printed materials, several scenes of Portland in the 1840s. He put together a book, Portland Through Grandfather's Eyes, which was recreated in 1981 by the Maine Historical Society as Mr. Goodhue Remembers Portland: Scenes from the Mid-19th Century, containing 23 of Goodhue's drawings and one by his great-granddaughter. Many of the buildings and streetscapes depicted in his sketches were destroyed in the Portland fire of 1866.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1858, Goodhue married Catherine O'Donnell, with whom he had six known children between 1859 and 1878, including Henrietta Quincy.\n\n\n== Death ==\nGoodhue died in 1910, aged 74. He was interred in Portland's Evergreen Cemetery. His wife was buried beside him upon her death eight years later.\n\n\n== References ==",

They celebrate the poster art and artists by serving the community through education by hosting screen printing classes as well as exhibiting artists work in there gallery space.\n\n\n== History ==\nThey opened there doors on July 1, 2017, and since have served the thriving poster community in San Francisco through both the exhibitions and printmaking studio. The building is located in Lower Haight and has a complex history, originally being part of San Francisco State Teachers' College (now SFSU). Additionally it is home to the iconic The Bronze Bunny sculpture by Jeremy Fish.\n\n\n=== Community ===\nHaight Street Art Center's focus on community has allowed them to host printmaking pop ups at a variety of offsite locations including, the California Academy of Sciences, Outside Lands, the National AIDS Memorial Grove, and Amoeba Records.\nAdditionally, they collaborate with local artists to engage differing communities in San Francisco. Most recently in 2023, they have worked with mural artist Oscar Lopez to bring awareness to food justice issues and climate in California. This project was mural based and included community pop ups as well as printmaking classes onsite.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Non-combatant casualty value (NCV), also known as the non-combatant and civilian casualty cut-off value (NCV or NCCV), is a military rule of engagement which provides an estimate of the worth placed on the lives of non-combatants, i.e. civilians or non-military individuals within a conflict zone. It has become an element of strategic planning and policy-making during a number of armed conflicts, providing a quantification of the proportionality principle as interpreted by the military command, and thus influencing decisions regarding the use of force and \"acceptable\" collateral damage. It has been described as a \"central value in contemporary Western war\" and \"perhaps our starkest rule of engagement\".\nThe value is used as a threshold for delegated authority at the operational level; the threshold can be exceeded if the military commander is able to request and achieve sign-off from higher echelons within the military or political framework.\nInternational law's historical prohibition against intentionally targeting civilians has been said to be poorly suited to modern warfare, due to its notion of \"intent\". NCV calculations are possible in modern warfare due to the availability of wider information sets and advanced weaponry with more accurate targeting, reducing collateral damage. The targeting process has been systematized and proceduralized, allowing for the rationalization of the killing of noncombatants.\n\n\n== Valuation of lives ==\nAcceptability of NCV levels vary depending on the type of target and military objective, or for a specific area of operations, mission, or weapon system. The two most significant factors are: (1) the perceived value of the local civilians, and (2) the perceived value of the target.\nThe value attributed to civilian lives depends on racial and geographic factors. Western forces operating in Western states, for example against a domestic terrorist attack, will use an NCV close to zero, in order to minimize casualties amongst their own citizens. Equivalent operations by Western forces in non-Western countries will use significantly higher NCVs.\nLower NCVs are considered acceptable for \"high-value targets\", i.e. strategically important targets such as enemy command centers or weapons facilities. Higher NCVs is usually considered unacceptable for civilian infrastructure, humanitarian sites, and densely populated areas where the risk of civilian casualties is greater.\nReported examples include:\n\nUS forces in the Iraq War, high value target, initial phase of the war: NCV of 29-30\nUS forces in the Iraq War, rank-and-file jihadist: NCV significantly lower\nUS forces in Afghanistan: NCV of 1\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nNCV has faced criticism for its subjective nature, potential for manipulation, discrepancies in its application across different conflicts, and possible contravention of international humanitarian law. Critics argue that assigning a numerical value to human life undermines the inherent dignity and rights of non-combatants, reducing them to mere statistics in military calculations. Moreover, the lack of standardized methodologies for determining NCV and the influence of political considerations raise concerns about its reliability and ethical implications.\nAccording to Mathias Delori, in military assessments of moral actions the \"actual number of deaths and injuries hardly counts... the ‘way’ in which violence is perpetrated matters more than the actual level of violence... it is the very act of calculation - the very fact that calculation took place - that justifies action... [and] although all lives matter in principle, some lives count more than others in practice\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nCivilian casualties from U.S. drone strikes\nCivilian casualty ratio\nLoss exchange ratio\nCollateral damage\nAcceptable loss\nLegitimate military target\nProportionality (law)\nMilitary necessity\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDelori, Mathias (2020-02-03). \"The politics of emotions in contemporary wars\".

        "content": "Parliamentary elections were held in Serbia on 23 May 1898 to elect members of the National Assembly. The result was a victory for the Liberal Party, which won 112 of the 194 seats.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe parliamentary elections of June 1897 had been boycotted by the Liberal Party, while the Serbian Progressive Party had been dissolved prior to the elections. As a result, the People's Radical Party won all seats in the National Assembly.\nThe Radical Party's Đorđe Simić remained Prime Minister, but was dismissed by King Alexander I in October 1897 and replaced by Vladan Đorđević.\nOn 14 March 1898 the Assembly was dissolved, with the intention of holding new elections. A decree was issued on 18 April setting the election date as 23 May. 194 members were elected, up to 65 additional members appointed.\n\n\n== Campaign ==\nThe Liberal Party contested the elections in an alliance with the Serbian Progressive Party, while the People's Radical Party ran alone after failing to agree any alliances.\n\n\n== Results ==\nAmidst manipulation by the police, the Liberal Party won a majority of the seats. The Progressives finished second, while the People's Radical Party won only one seat. The appointed members were largely supporters of the Liberal Party.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nSima Nestorović  was appointed president of the National Assembly and Dragomir Rajović as vice president. Vladan Đorđević remained Prime Minister.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "John Felix Jones (died 3 September 1878) was a British captain in the Indian navy and surveyor.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJones was, as midshipman and lieutenant of the East India Company's ship Palinurus, under Commander Robert Moresby, engaged in the survey of the northern part of the Red Sea, 1829–34. The charts were principally drawn by Jones. He was next employed in the survey of Ceylon and the Gulf of Manaar, under Lieutenant Powell, and in May 1840 joined Lieutenant C. D. Campbell, commanding the Nitocris, in the survey of Mesopotamia, in the course of which he connected the Euphrates and Mediterranean by chronometric measurements for longitude. In October 1841 Captain Lynch commenced the survey of the Euphrates, and on his retirement in 1843 was succeeded by Jones, who continued for several years the examination of the Tigris and Euphrates. Consequent on the disputes between Persia and Turkey in 1843, Jones, in company with Major Sir Henry Rawlinson, was sent in August 1844 to collect information respecting the boundary, the results obtained being officially printed in 1849, under the title ‘Narrative of a Journey through Parts of Persia and Kurdistan.’ In 1848 Jones examined the course of the ancient Nahrwan canal, and surveyed the once fertile region which it irrigated. In 1850 he surveyed the old bed of the Tigris, discovered the site of the ancient Opis, and made researches in the vicinity of the Median wall and Physcus of Xenophon (cf. Smith, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography). In 1852 he made a trigonometrical survey of the country between the Tigris and the Upper Zab, including the ruins of Nineveh, the results of which are recorded in a series of maps of ‘Assyrian Vestiges,’ and the accompanying memoir. In 1853 he completed a map of Bagdad on a large scale, with a memoir on the province. In 1854 he was named political agent at Bagdad and consul-general in Turkish Arabia. In 1855 he was appointed political agent in the Persian Gulf, and in that capacity was able to render important services during the war in 1856, and still more during the mutiny of 1857–8. Broken health then compelled him to return to England, and, though he revisited Bombay in 1863, he had no further active employment. His later years were spent in geographical work for the India office, and in 1875 he completed a beautifully drawn map, in four sheets, of Western Asia, including the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates; it remains in manuscript in the India office. He was also a constant contributor to the ‘Geographical Magazine’ and an active fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. He died at Norwood on 3 September 1878.\nThe most important of his numerous memoirs are included in ‘Selections from the Records of the Bombay Government,’ 1857, new ser. No. 43.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1892). \"Jones, John Felix\". In Lee, Sidney (ed.).

        "content": "The 2003 Tatra Mountains avalanche was an avalanche that occurred on 28 January 2003, sweeping away nine out of a thirteen-member group heading to the summit of Rysy in the Tatra Mountains. The participants of the trip were students from the I Leon Kruczkowski High School in Tychy and individuals associated with the school's sports club Pion.\nOn 28 October 2010, the film Cisza premiered, based on the events of 2003.\n\n\n== Avalanche ==\nA group of youths consisting of 20 high school students and one 22-year-old student from Tychy arrived at the mountain hut at Morskie Oko on 27 January 2003. The organizer and guide of the tragically ended expedition, as well as one of the two group supervisors, was Mirosław Szumny, a geography teacher and head of the school's sports club Pion, who had previously taken students on mountain trips multiple times but did not have formal qualifications to lead them. At the mountain hut, Szumny spoke with the Tatra Volunteer Search and Rescue worker Władysław Cywiński, who – as stated in a letter to Michał Jagiełło in 2005 – strongly advised against climbing Rysy, suggested hiring a mountain guide, warned that the youths were not prepared for such a climb, and the groups were too numerous, but he failed to convince Mirosław Szumny. The first part of the group climbed Rysy without any problems on January 27, and the second part was supposed to reach the summit the next day. On the same day, members of the first group, in a conversation with a member of the Tatra Volunteer Search and Rescue avalanche commission, Lesław Riemen, reported that the snow layer was approximately ankle-deep.\nDuring the night, the weather conditions changed: there was a warming and rain. The avalanche risk level was the second (moderate) on a five-point scale. Nevertheless, Mirosław Szumny, along with the second supervisor, Tomasz Zbiegien, and the second part of the group (total of 13 people: 10 high school students, a university student – the brother of one of the high school students, and two supervisors) set out for the summit. They left the mountain hut at 6:30 AM.\nAn avalanche towards Czarny Staw descended around 11:00 AM from Rysy, almost from the very top. At the moment when it hit the group, they were divided: three people were in the front, and two smaller groups were in the back. The size of the avalanche is estimated at 13 hectares, the length of the movement track at over 1200 meters, and the mass of the falling snow at 26,000 tons (this was the amount remaining on the surface; according to experts, much more snow was pushed into the lake), and the avalanche's front had several meters in height. The impact was so strong that it cracked the ice cover on a large part of the lake's surface, even at a distance of over 200 meters from the shore, despite it having a thickness ranging from 70 to 100 centimeters. Four people, including Mirosław Szumny, found themselves above the avalanche's edge, which prevented them from being injured.\n\n\n== Causes of the avalanche ==\nExpert topoclimatologists investigating the causes of the avalanche determined that the avalanche was triggered by a series of natural factors \"with the possibility of secondary influence of human interference\". Scientists did not conclude whether the behavior of the excursion participants could have contributed to the avalanche. The court acknowledged the competence of the scientists and accepted that the avalanche occurred spontaneously.\nAccording to the analysis by Dr. Mieczysław Sobik from the University of Wrocław, the cause of the avalanche was the atmospheric conditions in the months leading up to the disaster. Alternating temperature drops and warm-ups led to the formation of ice crusts, significantly hindering the bonding of new snow layers with existing ones. Additionally, the weather conditions contributed to the formation of cup-shaped snow layers, which enable the occurrence of a \"slab\" avalanche. The immediate cause of the avalanche was the last snowfall, with the warming that occurred the day before the avalanche having no significance. The avalanche occurred in two stages: the first stage was the descent from Kocioł pod Rysami, which in the second stage merged with the snow from the Rysa couloir.\n\n\n== Rescue operation ==\n\nAssistance was immediately summoned after the accident by a random tourist who found himself in the immediate vicinity of the avalanche but outside its range. The expedition was personally led by Jan Krzysztof, the head of the rescue service. A group of rescuers from the Tatra Volunteer Search and Rescue found one person at the beginning, partially buried under the snow, a girl named Luiza, who had a broken arm and general bruises. Rescuers only realized the extent of the tragedy when a teacher arrived at the scene. After some time, two more people were rescued. Rescuer Grzegorz Bargiel found under a meter of snow one of the excursion participants, Przemysław, who was already without breath and pulse. After resuscitation, he was transported by helicopter to the hospital, but after 72 days, he died in the hospital. A pedagogue helping the rescuers at the avalanche site found another of his students, Łukasz, who was deceased.\nDuring the day, 36 Tatra Volunteer Search and Rescue rescuers worked at the avalanche site, including two doctors and six avalanche dog handlers, as well as fifteen or seventeen trained employees of the Tatra National Park, including the director of the Tatra National Park, Paweł Skawiński. In the evening of the day of the avalanche, the search was suspended due to bad weather conditions. In particular, rescuers did not consider it possible to search the area around Czarny Staw. At this point, many of them were convinced that the remaining victims were buried under its ice (this is the opinion expressed by Adam Marasek, one of the most experienced rescuers, among others); this assumption later proved to be fully correct.\nThe next day, at 6:00 AM, the search was resumed despite the third level of avalanche danger. On the same day, there was a malfunction of the Sokół helicopter, during which both helicopter engines were successively shut down. The crew managed to jump out of the aircraft (from a height of several meters) when the first engine stopped, and its members suffered only minor injuries. During the attempt to return to the landing site, the second engine also failed. Henryk Serda landed autorotationally in the village of Murzasichle, but during the touchdown, the helicopter suffered serious damage (the tail beam was broken). Further searches, also conducted with the help of Slovak rescuers, did not bring any results. Dogs with sensitive noses indicated places on the lake, but conducting searches there in winter was impossible.\nUpon receiving news of the tragedy in the Tatra Mountains, a crisis management team was established at the City Hall of Tychy by order of the Mayor of Tychy, Andrzej Dziuba. On the same evening, families of the avalanche victims traveled from Tychy to Zakopane. The next day, mourning was declared in Silesia. The remaining six bodies, pushed under the ice of Czarny Staw, were only found in the spring, after the thaw; one of them was retrieved from a depth of 26 meters. The last victim was found on June 17. In total, Tatra Volunteer Search and Rescue organized 14 search expeditions, involving 260 rescuers, 36 avalanche dogs, and the rescuers worked for 2,203 hours.\n\n\n== Case of the helicopter ==\n\nThe management of the Air Ambulance Service accused pilot Henryk Serda of violating procedures and dismissed him from work, but not specifically due to any allegation related to the accident at Czarny Staw; one of the accusations was insubordination. Serda defended himself by claiming that the dismissal was retaliation for criticizing the organization. The pilot appealed to the labor court, and in 2005, he was reinstated to work in the Air Ambulance Service. At the same time, the prosecutor's office charged him with unintentionally causing the accident due to failure to activate the engine anti-icing system, as suggested by the investigation conducted by the Main Commission for the Investigation of Aviation Accidents. Serda defended himself by maintaining that he had activated the system, and if it did not work, it could have been the fault of the helicopter's owner – the Air Ambulance Service, which did not properly maintain the equipment. Ultimately, he was acquitted of the charge; the court allowed that the accident could have been caused by snow entering the engine.\n\n\n== Trials ==\nIn February 2004, a criminal trial regarding the tragic death of high school students, a university student, and a group leader began before the District Court in Katowice. Mirosław Szumny, a geography teacher and organizer of the tragic trip, was accused. The prosecution, based on the expert opinion, alleged that the accused committed numerous errors: the group was too large, the participants were walking too close to each other, the group was poorly equipped, the youths were not adequately prepared, as it was the first winter trip to the Tatra Mountains for most of them, and above all, that he did not consider the deteriorating weather conditions. As a result of this trial, the court sentenced the teacher for unintentionally causing danger and imposed a one-year suspended prison sentence for three years. In the verdict announced on 22 March 2005, the court accepted that the avalanche occurred spontaneously. At the same time, it recognized that the suspect did not have the qualifications to lead the group and, contrary to the Tatra Volunteer Search and Rescue's suggestions, did not hire a mountain guide. The court dismissed the charge of organizing the trip the previous day (January 27), as it deemed that although the teacher exposed the participants to danger, prosecution should proceed from a private complaint, which was not filed. The court noted that it applied a suspended sentence because the teacher had no prior convictions and enjoyed an impeccable reputation. The prosecutor appealed the verdict.\nDuring the second trial, Mirosław Szumny admitted to making mistakes in organizing the trip, stating that when going to the mountains with the youths, he was aware that an avalanche could occur and that there was no weather that would provide a sense of security. On 11 April 2006, he was sentenced to two years in prison, suspended for four years. The Katowice Court of Appeal ruled that the accident occurred due to the unintentional fault of the teacher.\nIn 2016, Andrzej Matyśkiewicz, whose two sons died in the avalanche, filed a civil lawsuit against the City Hall of Tychy, the teacher-organizer of the trip, and the school sports club for compensation of 700,000 PLN with interest. In 2018, the District Court in Katowice ruled, in a non-binding manner, that the teacher and the club must pay 140,000 PLN in compensation. The court explained that the city's civil liability had expired. Both the plaintiff and the defendant teacher appealed the verdict. In February 2019, the Katowice Court of Appeal upheld the amount of compensation awarded to the deceased boys' father by the District Court, dismissing the appeals filed by him and the teacher. At the same time, the proceedings regarding the sports club were suspended. After the verdict became final, at the initiative of internet users from Tychy, two graduates of the Leon Kruczkowski High School organized a fundraiser on the zrzutka.pl platform, aiming to raise funds to pay the awarded compensation. The full amount was successfully raised.\n\n\n== Fatalities ==\nPrzemysław Kwiecień (18 lat) – znaleziony 28 stycznia;\nSzymon Lenartowicz (17 lat) – znaleziony 13 maja;\nAndrzej Matyśkiewicz (16 lat) – znaleziony 7 czerwca;\nŁukasz Matyśkiewicz (22 lata) – znaleziony 28 stycznia;\nJustyna Narloch (16 lat) – znaleziona 17 czerwca;\nEwa Pacanowska (17 lat) – znaleziona 7 czerwca;\nArtur Rygulski (18 lat) – znaleziony 5 czerwca;\nTomasz Zbiegień (36 lat) – znaleziony 8 czerwca.\nPrzemysław Kwiecień died in the hospital ten weeks after the accident.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "revision_id": 1219872142,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Color and Symmetry is a book by Arthur L. Loeb published by Wiley Interscience in 1971. The author adopts an unconventional algorithmic approach to generating the line and plane groups based on the concept of \"rotocenter\" (the invariant point of a rotation). He then introduces the concept of two or more colors to derive all of the plane dichromatic symmetry groups and some of the polychromatic symmetry groups.\n\n\n== Structure and topics ==\nThe book is divided into three parts. In the first part, chapters 1–7, the author introduces his \"algorismic\" (algorithmic) method based on \"rotocenters\" and \"rotosimplexes\" (a set of congruent rotocenters). He then derives the 7 frieze groups and the 17 wallpaper groups.\nIn the second part, chapters 8–10, the dichromatic (black-and-white, two-colored) patterns are introduced and the 17 dichromatic line groups and the 46 black-and-white dichromatic plane groups are derived.\nIn the third part, chapters 11–22, polychromatic patterns (3 or more colors), polychromatic line groups, and polychromatic plane groups are derived and illustrated. Loeb's synthetic approach does not enable a comparison of colour symmetry concepts and definitions by other authors, and it is therefore not surprising that the number of polychromatic patterns he identifies are different from that published elsewhere.\n\n\n== Audience ==\nUnusually, the author does not state the target audience for his book; his publisher, in their dust jacket blurb, say \"Color and Symmetry will be of primary interest on the one hand to crystallographers, chemists, material scientists, and mathematicians. On the other hand, this volume will serve the interests of those active in the fields of design, visual and environmental studies and architecture.\"\nOnly a school-level mathematical background is required to follow the author's logical development of his argument. Group theory is not used in the book, which is beneficial to readers without this specific mathematical background, but it makes some of the material more long-winded than it would be if it had been developed using standard group theory.\nMichael Holt in his review for Leonardo said: \"In this erudite and handsomely presented monograph, then, designers should find a rich source of explicit rules for pattern-making and mathematicians and crystallographers a welcome and novel slant on symmetry operations with colours.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe book had a generally positive reception from contemporary reviewers.  W.E. Klee in a review for Acta Crystallographica wrote: \"Color and Symmetry will surely stimulate new interest in colour symmetries and will be of special interest to crystallographers. People active in design may also profit from this book.\" D.M. Brink in a review for Physics Bulletin published by the Institute of Physics said: \"The book will be useful to workers with a technical interest in periodic structures and also to more general readers who are fascinated by symmetrical patterns. The illustrations encourage the reader to understand the mathematical structure underlying the patterns.\"\nJ.D.H. Donney in a review for Physics Today said: \"This book should prove useful to physicists, chemists, crystallographers\n(of course), but also to decorators and designers, from textiles to ceramics. It will be enjoyed, not only by mathematicians, but by all lovers of orderliness, logic and beauty.\" David Harker in a review for Science said: \"It may well be that this work will become a classic essay on planar color symmetry\"\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nThe author's idiosyncratic approach was not adopted by researchers in the field, and later assessments of Loeb's contribution to color symmetry were more critical of his work than earlier reviewers had been. Marjorie Senechal said that Loeb's work on polychromatic patterns, whilst not wrong, imposed artificial restrictions which meant that some valid colored patterns with three or more colors were excluded from his lists.\nR.L.E. Schwarzenberger in 1980 said: \"The study of colour symmetry has been bedevilled by a lack of precise definitions when the number of colours is greater than two ... it is unfortunate that this paper was apparently ignored by Shubnikov and Loeb whose books give incomplete and unsystematic listings.\" In a 1984 review paper Schwarzenberger remarks: \"... these authors [including Loeb] confine themselves to a restricted class of colour group ... for N > 2 the effect is to dramatically limit the number of colour groups considered.\"\nBranko Grünbaum and G.C. Shephard in their book Tilings and patterns  gave an assessment of previous work in the field. Commenting on Color and Symmetry they said:\"Loeb gives an original, interesting and satisfactory account of the 2-color groups ... unfortunately when discussing multicolor patterns, Loeb restricts the admissible color changes so severely that he obtains a total of only 54 periodic k-color configurations with k ≥ 3.\" Later authors determined that the total number of k-color configurations with 3 ≤ k ≤ 12 is 751.\n\n\n== References ==",

Center Dave Woodward was named to the second team and tackle Jim Poole to the third team. Quarterback Billy Harper, end Ulysses Kendall, and tackle Jerry Wade received honorable mention. Six Cameron players were selected as first-team players on the 1961 Oklahoma junior college all-star team: backs Joe Don Looney, Billy Harper, and Bob Kelly; center Dave Woodward; tackle James Poole; and defensive tackle Jerry Wade. \nKelly led the team during the regular season with 712 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns on 134 carries, an average of 5.3 yards per carry. Looney placed second with 531 yards and 10 touchdowns on 109 carries for an average of 5.8 yards per carry. Looney also punted for Cameron, averaging 38.6 yards on 17 punts. Harper led the team in passing, completing 26 of 56 attempts for 538 yards, nine touchdowns, and three interceptions. Ulysses Kendall was the leading receiver with 12 receptions for 336 yards and four touchdowns.\nLooney went on to win All-American honors for the 1962 Oklahoma Sooners football team and played six years in the National Football League.\nThe team played its home games at Ron Stephens Stadium in Lawton, Oklahoma.\n\n\n== Schedule ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": "2021-03-27 21:06:20",
        "content": "Cryphalus dorsalis is a small bark beetle (subfamily Scolytinae, family Curculionidae), 1.60–1.90 mm long and found in southern parts of Asia with a distribution range from India in the west to Java (Indonesia), the Philippines and southern China in the east. Little information is available on its biology, even on its host plants. In a detailed re-description of the species based on light trap material and specimens without host plant records, Johnson et al. (2020) mentioned that fir (Abies) has been cited as a host plant in one publication which recorded it from Hainan Island (China) where Abies does not grow.\n\n\n== Description ==\nCryphalus dorsalis can be identified by the combination of its size, a transverse ridge on the male frons, the arrangement of scales and spatula-shaped setae, as well as the smooth elytra. Compared to many other species of the genus Cryphalus, the adults are rather compact, only 1.75x longer than wide. The dorsal colour is brownish with some parts lighter, the ventral colour is lighter brown. The femora of the legs are pale, but the tibia are dark brown. In profile, the anterior part of the pronotum is slightly curved, not strongly rounded or domed as in some species of this genus. The pronotum is somewhat triangular in profile and there are around 50 tiny humps (also called 'asperitites') on the anterior part, the 'pronotal disc'.\nThe elytra are 1.6 times longer than the pronotum. They have longitudinal stripes, visible as rows of punctures. However, unlike in many other species of Cryphalus, these are weakly developed and the elytra have a smooth appearance, devoid of the longitudinal grooves and pits found in other Cryphalus species. Females have a size of 1.60–1.90 mm. Males are slightly smaller than females. The frons (frontal part of the head) of the male has a straight trans­verse ridge (carina).\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nCryphalus dorsalis has been originally described from India by Motschulsky as Hypoborus dorsalis. After examining the type series, it was transferred to the genus Cryphalus by Wood who noted that it is identical \"or very near\" to Cryphalus indicus. C. indicus, in turn, was  assigned as a synonym of Cryphalus dorsalis by Johnson (2020).\nThis indirect assignment of Hypoborus dorsalis as a synonym of Cryphalus dorsalis by Wood and Johnson has caused some confusion among authors and the species is listed as Cryphalus dorsalis Wood, 1969 in some cases. Further, Hypoborus dorsalis Motschulsky, 1866 may be still listed as a separate species in some databases and by some authors. In addition, it is also listed as a synonym of Hypoborus ficus by some authors. For example, as of April 2024 the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) lists it 3 times: a) as a separate species, b) as a synonym of Hypoborus ficus, and c) as Cryphalus dorsalis Wood, 1969.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Xianju County Library (Chinese: 仙居县图书馆), also known as Xianju Library (仙居图书馆), is a county-level public library located in Xianju, Taizhou, Zhejiang Province, People's Republic of China. It is under the jurisdiction of the Xianju County People's Government and is supervised by the Bureau of Culture, Radio, Television, Tourism, and Sports of Xianju County. The library building is located at No. 2 Jiefang Street in Xianju County and includes several branches and academies in various forms. As of July 2018, the collection of Xianju County Library reached 811,314 volumes. In 2018, it was promoted to a national first-grade library.\nThe history of the library can be traced back to the Xianju County Public Library established in 1927. Subsequently, it was divided into the Book Department of Xianju County Public Education Institute, the Library Room of Xianju County People's Cultural Palace, and the Library Room of Xianju County Cultural Palace. These institutions were the predecessors of the independent Xianju County Library established in August 1978. The current library building was constructed in 1986, with an area ranking at the bottom among those in Taizhou, making it unable to meet the daily needs. The ongoing construction of the Xianju County Library as part of the \"Xianju County Urban Cultural Complex\" will address this issue by relocating the entire library.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the spring of the 16th year of the Republic of China (1927), Wang Shijiao of Shuikongtou Village in Xianju Chengguan donated 50 yuan and assisted with 1 mu of farmland to establish a reading room. Subsequently, the Xianju County government convened people from all walks of life to discuss and establish the Xianju County Public Library, with the library located in the Wenming Building. In August of the 18th year of the Republic of China, following the order of the Provincial Department of Education, the Xianju County People's Education Institute was established, and the original County Public Library was renamed the Book Department of the Xianju County People's Education Institute. In the 27th year of the Republic of China, the Provincial Department of Education ordered the disbandment of the People's Education Institute and its replacement with a mobile teaching group, while also approving the establishment of a county library. Thus, the Xianju County Public Library was re-established. In February of the following year, the mobile teaching group was disbanded, the People's Education Institute was reinstated, and the county library was once again incorporated into the Book Department of the People's Education Institute, with its location relocated to the Confucian Temple.\nIn July 1949, the People's Liberation Army entered Xianju, and all staff of the Xianju County People's Education Institute resigned, resulting in the loss of books. In September of the same year, the remaining books and equipment were stored in the Confucian Temple, and the construction of a new library began. In August of the following year, the Xianju County People's Cultural Palace was established, with a library room collecting books. Subsequently, various systems gradually formed. In December 1952, the Xianju County People's Cultural Palace was renamed the Xianju County Cultural Palace. During the Cultural Revolution, library borrowing services were intermittent. In early 1967, the Xianju County Cultural Palace established a Cultural Revolution Group, which replaced the director in leading the work of the cultural palace. Within a year after July 1968, the county cultural palace did not have a formal leadership structure and was controlled by mass organizations. In 1972, the library room reopened, but was limited to reading Mao Zedong's quotations, works of Marx and Lenin, and revolutionary opera scripts. In the same year, the central government issued relevant documents, and the Xianju County Cultural Palace resumed the directorship system. Due to the situation, the director and the Revolutionary Leading Group of the Xianju County Education Bureau coexisted and took turns leading the work. In 1974, the Xianju County Cultural Palace invested 70,000 yuan to build a building, which was completed in 1976.\nIn April 1977, after the end of the Cultural Revolution, the library room of the Xianju County Cultural Palace moved into the main building of the county cultural palace, with over 310 square meters of space for activities. On August 1, 1978, the Xianju County Library was established. In April 1979, Wang Miyu was appointed as the first director; in May, it became an independent entity under the Xianju County Bureau of Culture and Education. After 1982, it became subordinate to the Xianju County Bureau of Culture. On June 30, 1984, the construction of the Xianju County Library building began. After completion in October 1986, it was opened to the public on New Year's Day the following year and has been in use ever since. In 1994, the Xianju County Library was rated as a national second-grade library, one of the first in the country.\nOn March 9, 2017, the Xianju County Library Council was established, and the first council meeting was held, electing Zhu Shoulong as the chairman. In 2018, with a total score of 988.5 points and ranking second in Taizhou, it was promoted to a national first-grade library assessed by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. In May 2019, the construction of the Xianju County Urban Cultural Complex project began. The project is located east of the Xianju Party School, covering a total area of 47.48 mu and a total construction area of 70,400 square meters. The Xianju County Library will move into this project.\n\n\n== Building ==\nIn August 1949, after the establishment of the library room of the Xianju County People's Cultural Palace, the next month saw the planning of a new library in the Confucian Temple. It consisted of two east wing rooms totaling 40 square meters, while ancient books were stored in three rooms upstairs totaling 50 square meters. The following year, the library room was relocated to the Wending Building, consisting of three rooms with a total area of 80 square meters (with ancient books still stored in the original location). In August 1951, the library room moved back to the Confucian Temple, with an additional south-facing bungalow of nearly 40 square meters. In June 1963, it moved to five bungalows on Xueqian Street, covering 75 square meters, offering lending and newspaper reading services to the public, and adding a \"Youth Home\" (which relocated to Chengguan Town -now in the area of Taiping Street- in 1965 and became the town cultural station). In 1964, some books were moved to the vicinity of the Xiaocai Market, renting two rooms totaling 40 square meters in a civilian house. In 1965, the library on Xueqian Street temporarily moved to three bungalows totaling 50 square meters in the west wing of the Xianju County Cultural Palace, but soon returned to Xueqian Street.\nAfter the start of the Cultural Revolution in 1966, the library room was closed. In 1968, the library room's book depository moved to two rooms totaling 40 square meters at No. 212 Nanmen Street, with an additional room of 10 square meters. After the reopening of the library room in 1972, it moved back to the west wing of the county cultural palace, and ancient books were also moved to the county cultural palace in July and August, stored in the east wing. In 1973, the three bungalows in the south wing were expanded, with an area of 60 square meters. From summer 1975 to October 1976, the juvenile reading room opened at the entrance of Jiufang Lane, opposite a rented civilian house. From 1974 to 1975, a total of 70,000 yuan was allocated by the provincial and county governments of Zhejiang and Xianju to begin construction of the cultural palace building, which was completed in August 1976.\nIn April 1977, after the end of the Cultural Revolution, the library room moved into the cultural palace building. The ten small rooms on the west side of the third floor were used as book depositories, covering an area of nearly 150 square meters, while the six large rooms on the ground floor were used as reading rooms, with an area of 231 square meters. Among them, there was one lending library, two semi-open-shelf lending rooms, two reading rooms for newspapers, and one reference book depository. Ancient books were moved to the third floor of the building in the second half of 1977, occupying three rooms. After the formal establishment of the Xianju County Library in August 1978, the building remained at the original location for eight years. During this period, the independent library building started construction in June 1984, consisting of four rooms on four floors and three rooms on five floors, covering an area of 0.5 mu, with a construction area of 1440 square meters. The project was completed in October 1986, and it was put into use in January 1987. After the completion of the new building, the nine staff members worked overtime to move and decorate, saving the state more than 3,000 yuan in expenses. The building has been in use ever since. The original cultural palace building is now used as dormitories for some employees.\nThe area of the library building is among the lowest in the entire city of Taizhou, and the original building has long been unable to meet daily needs, so the library has been planning to build a new one. In December 2014, the design of the new building of Xianju County Library began, and the new building was located on the north side of the foot of Nanfeng Mountain, designed by the Landscape Design Institute of China Academy of Art. In May 2019, the construction of Xianju County Urban Cultural Complex project started, which is the first large-scale comprehensive public cultural infrastructure project in Taizhou City. The project is located on the east side of the Xianju Party School, at the junction of Yong'an Creek and Nanfeng Mountain, with a total land area of 47.48 mu and a total construction area of 70,400 square meters. The total investment of the project is about 636 million yuan, and the construction period is 3 years. Xianju County Library, Xianju County Museum, Xianju County Cultural Center, and Xianju Theater will all settle in the project. Among them, Xianju County Library has collection areas, reading areas, conference areas, etc. After the completion of the project, Xianju County Library will be able to store at least one million books, effectively alleviating the current shortage of seats and bookshelves.\n\n\n=== Current building ===\nThe main building of Xianju County Library is located at No. 2 Jiefang Street, covering an area of 0.5 mu, with a main building area of 1440 square meters and a total area of 3725 square meters. The library is equipped with book lending room, newspaper reading room, children's room, electronic reading room, reception area, local books room, etc. There is also an academic lecture hall in the library, which is fully equipped and can accommodate more than 100 people.\n\n\n=== Overview ===\nAs of May 2019, Xianju County Library has built 18 township branch libraries, 8 HeHe Book Bars, 12 specialty branch libraries, and 8 academies. Among them, specialty branch libraries are set up in places such as community correction centers, PICC, and maternal and child health hospitals, selecting books with targeted content, such as medical and health books in maternal and child health hospital branch libraries, and will continue to build 4 to 5 in 2019. \nAcademies undertake the task of \"inheriting and promoting local excellent culture\" and have been recommended by the Xianju County Government as an important work. In May 2016, the \"Xianju Academy Construction Plan\" was specifically issued, clearly positioning the Xianju Academy as \"a new type of cultural work carrier integrating traditional cultural education and modern humanities education.\" The academy has received support from the masses and various departments, and has had a positive impact. Xianju County Library also has a large mobile library, which regularly delivers books, exhibitions, and lectures to remote areas, providing services to people in remote areas. The collections of all branch libraries can be borrowed and returned throughout the county, achieving \"one-card access\" even in other branch libraries.\n\n\n== Library affairs ==\n\n\n=== Overview ===\nXianju County Library is a subordinate unit of the Bureau of Culture, Radio, Television, Tourism, and Sports of Xianju County, which budgeted 5.15 million yuan for the library in 2019, mainly used for personnel salaries and book purchases. The library has 11 formal positions, with 8 current permanent staff as of April 2019. As of April 2019, Jiang Zhien was the director of Xianju County Library. The mission of Xianju County Library is to \"improve the quality of citizens and create a literary Xianju\"; the vision is to \"build Xianju County Library into a first-grade county-level library in China\".\nIn 2017, Xianju County Library had an annual circulation of 772,000 volumes and received more than 1.39 million visitors annually. As of May 2017, Xianju County Library had issued 21,466 library cards.\n\n\n=== Collection and borrowing information ===\nAs of July 2018, Xianju County Library had a total collection of 811,314 volumes (including 172,000 volumes in rural cultural auditoriums).

The library also has a set of reprints of \"Siku Quanshu\", as well as \"Republic Series\" and 16 sets of rare edition reference books, which are the \"treasures\" of Xianju County Library.\nPreviously, to apply for a library card at Xianju County Library, a deposit of 100 yuan was required. Starting from March 2018, residents of Xianju obtained library cards for free at the main library or branch libraries by presenting their Citizen Card, with the same privileges as regular library cards. Each cardholder can borrow up to 5 books for a period of one month, with an extension of 15 days allowed once.\n\n\n=== Digital services ===\nXianju County Library organizes professional personnel to digitize local chronicles such as \"Xianju County Chronicles\" and \"Guangxu Xianju County Chronicles\", processing them digitally through information technology so that readers can read them online without the need for physical books. Xianju County Library was the first in Zhejiang Province to initiate database project construction. Currently, it has built 8 databases including \"Xianju Historical and Humanistic Map\", \"Xianju Lantern Database\", \"Xianju Colored Stone Inlay Database\", \"Xianju Folk Embroidery Art Database\", \"Millennium Ancient Town—Potan History of Changes\", \"Xianju Memory Database\", \"Xianju County Library Microenterprise Think Tank\", and \"Xianju County Special Literature Library\", with a total digital resource volume of 6.63 TB.\nThe library has also launched the \"Xianju County Digital Library\" service platform, providing access to 420 million Chinese and foreign literature information and 3.3 million book catalog information through the Zhejiang Digital Library platform. The digital library also contains local documents and special books from Xianju County, making it, according to Library Director Jiang Zhien, \"the first in Taizhou\". In addition to the above digital resources, Xianju County Library also has access to Fangzheng Apabi digital books, Tsinghua Tongfang full-text journals, papers, newspaper databases, the National Cultural Information Resource Sharing Platform, Longyuan journals, and Weipu Chinese science and technology journals. Readers can search for resources in the electronic reading room on the first floor of the library, with only an internet fee of 1 yuan per hour charged.\nIn terms of offline equipment, Xianju County Library and some branch libraries support borrowing books and entering the library using mobile phone QR codes, as well as self-service card issuance through card issuance machines.\n\n\n=== Activities ===\nXianju County Library organizes public lectures called \"Xianju Story Collection\", which are based on local culture and history, sparking a local cultural trend in Xianju County. Xianju County Library has also held activities such as \"Celebrating the New Year with Literary Joy\", \"Exhibition of the Public Library Law\", and a Spring Equinox Poetry Meeting, as well as lantern riddle guessing activities on Lantern Festival both online and offline via WeChat public accounts.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Wheatley Plaza (also known as the Wheatley Plaza Mall and as the Wheatley Gardens Mall) is a major, outdoor shopping center located at the southeastern corner of the intersection of Northern Boulevard (NY 25A) and Glen Cove Road (CR 1) in Greenvale, in the Town of North Hempstead, Nassau County, New York, United States. The center is owned and maintained by Manhasset-based Castagna Realty.\n\n\n== History ==\nWheatley Plaza was planned by Castagna & Sons (now Castagna Realty) – the same company responsible for the Americana Manhasset in the Strathmore section of Manhasset. First proposed by  Castagna in 1977, the center was constructed in 1980, as one of the shopping centers of its type on Long Island. It was built on the site of the former Wheatley Gardens flower nursery, and was designed to blend in with the surrounding community.\nWhen originally planned in 1977, the 9.57-acre (3.87 ha) development was envisioned to contain a movie theater, a supermarket, restaurants, and several retail stores. By 1978, when the Town of North Hempstead approved an extension of the rezoning of the land from residential to business & parking, to permit the center's construction (which was scheduled to commence that fall), the plans were amended. The amended plans retained the supermarket, restaurants, and 20-to-25 stores, but eliminated the movie theater; the rezoning was granted in 1977 but due to construction not beginning until the fall of 1978, more than 12 months after it was first granted, North Hempstead's laws required an extension to be granted. In its early planning phase, the center drew a considerable amount of opposition due to fears that the development would worsen the chronic congestion issues at the intersection of Northern Boulevard and Glen Cove Road. The project and the rezoning had the support of then-Town Supervisor Michael J. Tully Jr., who argued that the center & rezoning would be a better land use than the strip malls which could have otherwise been constructed.\nThe center soon secured anchor tenants, with Pathmark opening a large store in the supermarket space the year Wheatley Plaza opened, and with Ben's Kosher Deli opening a location in 1982. The establishment of the Pathmark at Wheatley Plaza was mentioned in The Washington Post in 1989, regarding the impacts had on smaller grocery stores in a community when large supermarkets begin competing with them.\nIn August 1980, shortly after Wheatley Plaza's opening, the 58 families which moved into the then-new Northern Woods Estates development in the Village of East Hills – located directly behind the parking lot – voiced complaints about the shopping center's lights at night, leading to a landscape screening to block the light from entering the neighborhood and the houses.\nIn 2010, Red Mango opened a location at Wheatley Plaza.\nIn 2011, Brooks Brothers opened a Fleece store at Wheatley Plaza; this was the company's third location to open in the United States.\nIn 2015, the Pathmark at Wheatley Plaza closed, following the bankruptcy of A&P, after having been a tenant of the center since its opening in 1980. It was subsequently replaced by a Stop & Shop the same year.\n\n\n== Major tenants ==\nAs of 2024, major tenants at Wheatley Plaza include Ben's Kosher Deli, Bluemercury, Paper Source, Starbucks, and Stop & Shop. Former major tenants at the center include Pathmark, Banana Republic, and Aerie.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAmericana Manhasset – Another Castagna-owned shopping mall in North Hempstead, located in nearby Manhasset.\nLake Success Shopping Center\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

The party is reportedly among one of several \"anti-immigrant parties\" registered ahead of the 2024 local elections.\nThe \"about\" section of the party's website outlines their position on migration (opposing \"open borders\"), education (rejecting what they deem indoctrination), neutrality, free speech, support for farmers (and opposing net zero) and housing (prioritising housing for Irish people).\nDavid O’Reilly, one of the three officers of its executive committee, contested the 2020 general election in Galway East, where he stated his opposition to same-sex marriage, abortion, and \"multi-cultural supremacy and mass migration\", and described climate change as a hoax. He came 11th, of 12 candidates in the constituency, with less than 0.6% of the vote and was eliminated in the first count.\n\n\n== References ==",

She co-curated an exhibition of papyri, portraits and Egyptian contemporary art at the John Rylands Library in 2012, and she has published papyri from the John Rylands collection. Her most recent book, Stolen Fragments: Black Markets, Bad Faith, and the Illicit Trade in Ancient Artefacts, was published in 2024 by Redwood Press and Stanford University Press. The book examines the purchase of a fragment of papyrus dating to the second century CE containing lines from Paul's Letter to the Romans by Steve Green, the billionaire owner of the craft chain Hobby Lobby. The fragment derived from the holdings of Oxford University and had been sold without the consent of the owners.\nBefore taking up a position at the University of Bologna in 2022, Mazza was a lecturer in Graeco-Roman material culture at the Department of Classics, Ancient History, Archaeology and Egyptology of the University of Manchester from 2009. She was previously the Tipton Distinguished Visiting Chair in Catholic Studies              (Department of Religious Studies) at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Mazza has written for Hyperallergic and Eidolon, and her work has been covered by The Guardian.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nMazza, R.

        "content": "Timekeeping on the Moon is an issue of synchronized human activity on the Moon and contact with such. The two main differences to timekeeping on Earth is the length of a day on the Moon, being the lunar day or lunar month, observable from Earth as the lunar phases, and the differences between Earth and the Moon of how differently fast time progresses, with 24 hours on the Moon being 58.7 microseconds faster, resulting from the different masses of the Moon and Earth, the effect being called gravitational time dilation.\nAs of early 2024, there is no lunar time standard. Instead, the time on the Moon is different for each country involved. Thus, American activities on the Moon run on the time zone of their mission control centre, while Chinese activities on the Moon run on China Standard Time. As more countries are active on the Moon and interact with each other, a different, unified system will be needed.\nIn 2024, the White House asked NASA to establish a unified Coordinated Lunar Time standard for the Moon and other celestial bodies by 2026.\nThe European Space Agency has proposed a lunar reference time for the Moon to solve this issue.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe technology used for the timekeeping devices deployed to the Moon have varied over the decades. Several Omega Speedmasters have been on the Moon, synched to Central Standard Time (CST).\nThe Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) kept a triple-precision count of time in a real time clock cuing from a quartz oscillator; a standby option (although never used) would allow it to update this count every 1.28 second (~0.78 hertz) — more often when not standing by. In addition to maintaining the clock cycle, computer timekeeping allowed the AGC to display the capsule's vertical and horizontal movements relative to the Moon's surface, in units of feet per second.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMonth\nLunar year\nTimekeeping on Mars\nInternational Celestial Reference System and its realizations\nNautical time\nSidereal time\n\n\n== References ==",

It has operated as the Union Depot Museum since 1990, and was added to the National Register in 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1847, the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad received a grant to construct a rail line south from Grand Rapids through Vicksburg. This line was completed in 1870. In 1872, the Grand Trunk Railway built a second line through the town. A wood framed depot was constructed at the intersection of the two lines by the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad. The Peninsular Railway leased space in the building, and the depot served both lines. This lasted until 1900, when a fire destroyed the building. \nIn 1903, plans were announced to construct a new depot, servicing both lines. The Grand Rapids & Indiana Railroad hired the Grand Rapids architectural firm Williamson & Crow to design the new depot. The depot opened in 1904. In 1920, Grand Trunk was taken over by the Canadian National Railway, and in 1922 the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad was taken over by the Pennsylvania Railroad.\nHowever, after World War II, passenger volumes decreased, and in 1968 the Pennsylvania Railroad ceased passenger operations to Vicksburg. In 1972, Canadian National followed suit. In 1974, all freight service was suspended. Around that time, the Vicksburg Historical Society was formed to preserve the building, and restoration efforts began in the early 1980s. In 1983, the village of Vicksburg purchased the building, and in 1990 it was dedicated as a museum.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Vicksburg Union Depot is a single story building constructed of red brick accentuated with stone detailing. It is sited at the intersection of two rail lines. The building has a skewed L-shaped footprint, with two wings each parallel to one section of track. The exterior design exhibits elements of both Romanesque Revival and Tudor Revival architecture. A projecting stone belt course encircles the building, and forms the sill of the windows on each side. The roof consists of a one-and-one-half story gabled central portion with lower, hipped extensions over each wing.\nA three-window projecting bay is situated in the center of the track side of the building. Gabled wall dormers, with parapets and arched windows, are located on each side. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Azza El Siddique (born in Khartoum, Sudan 1984) is a visual artist based in New Haven, Connecticut. She holds a Master of Fine Arts from Yale University (2019) and a Bachelor of Fine Arts from OCAD University. Her family immigrated to Vancouver, British Columbia, when she was four.\n\n\n== Practice ==\nAzza El Siddique's practice revolves around questions of power, temporality, memory, identity, and place, which she explores mainly though large-scale mixed media installations. Her works are often inspired by archaeology, but she eschews practices of conservation and allows her pieces to be affected by time. Some of the materials she uses include clay, scented oils, metal, water, light, and smoke, along with gravity and time which are actors in shaping the life cycle of her “aesthetic ecosystem”.\nEl Siddique's work has been featured in Vancouver, New York, Montreal, Buffalo, Toronto, Miami, and New Haven amongst other cities.\n\n\n== Selected Works ==\nLattice Be Transparent, which was presented at 8eleven Gallery in Toronto, was an installation of large sculptural works made of fabric, plastic, water, string, glass, cinderblocks, clay, and other materials.\nIn 2018, El Siddique's installation at Cooper Cole Gallery in Toronto  Let me hear you sweat included industrial metal shelving stacked with unfired clay vessels. The shelving was draped in vinyl to trap water from humidifiers and force condensation, rusting, and erosion. Another section positioned unfired clay vessels on a metal grate underneath dripping scented water, eroding the pieces throughout the course of the show.\nEl Siddique's 2023 installation that which trembles waves at Bradley Ertaskiran in Montreal foregrounded her interest in Egyptian and Nubian mythology. The installation centered on a large double-headed porcelain cobra, bound by metal scaffolding. During the time of exhibition, water dripped onto the installation causing corrosion over time. The sensorial environment was heightened by heat activated sandalwood perfumery.\n\n\n== Selected Group Exhibitions ==\nEl Siddique has been involved in more than 20 group exhibitions in Canada and internationally(website).\nIn 2019, El Siddique's work featured in Material Tells at Oakville Galleries (Toronto), Too Full to Cry at Shin Gallery (New York), Ripe at Dawn at Green Hall Gallery (New Haven), and NADA Miami.\nFor the show, fire is love, water is sorrow (2021), El Siddique engaged her work in conversation with that of her late brother Teto Elsiddique (1982–2017). The artist joined Elsiddique's paintings to a large metal scaffold, often exposing both the front and back of the works. Along with the scaffolding, El Siddique created metal canvases with soldered designs as counterparts to her brother's paintings. One of these canvases, One washes the other, was shown independently at Charles Moffett Gallery's “Genius Loci” (2023) in New York, which featured artists from around the world displaying a sensitivity to place and environment.\nAlso in 2021, El Siddique participated in MOCA's Greater Toronto Art 2021 in its inaugural iteration, which highlights prominent contemporary artists working in the greater Toronto area.\nIn 2024, El Siddique took part in Aporia: Notes to a Medium at the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery which explored the importance of doubt in navigating contemporary societies.\n\n\n== Awards/Grants ==\nEl Siddique is the recipient of over a dozen awards (website). Funding for her project The Edifice of Tirhaga Pt. I (ongoing: 2024) is funded by Creative Capital, a non-profit organization based in New York City. The project transforms El Siddique's late brother's pickup truck into a “mobile public sculpture”, relating it to Egyptian funerary rites, a recurring theme in her work, and the combination of ancient and modern technology.\n\n\n== Residencies ==\nIn 2021, El Siddique was resident artist at Amant, a non-profit art gallery in Brooklyn, NY, where she undertook archival research on Egyptian perfumery.\nIn 2022, she was a resident artist at John Michael Kohler Arts Center, where she worked on sculptural projects.\nEl Siddique's other residencies have included Silver Art Project (2020), The Lighthouse Works Fellowship (2019), Harbourfront Centre (2014–2017), and the Chautauqua School of Arts (2014).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Arthrobatis is an extinct genus of possible rays that lived during the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic in the United Kingdom. It contains one species, A. rileyi, and is the only member of the family Arthrobatidae. It might be the oldest known batoid, but its exact age and affinities are uncertain.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nArthropterus rileyi was named by Louis Agassiz in 1843 for pectoral fins from the Lias Group of England. The type material is lost; it was housed in the Bristol Museum and may have been destroyed in 1940 by the Bristol Blitz. The original genus name was preoccupied by the beetle Arthropterus. In 1940, Gilbert P. Whitley proposed Arthrobatis as a replacement.\nDavid S. Jordan named the family Arthropteridae in 1905. It was invalidated because its type genus was preoccupied and in 2024 it was replaced by Arthrobatidae.\n\n\n== Classification ==\nArthrobatis was initially identified as a shark by Agassiz. In 1848, it was first classified as a ray by Christoph Giebel and was synonymized with Platyrhina. Pieter Bleeker retained it as a distinct genus and assigned it to Rhinobatidae in 1859. It was referred to Rajidae in 1880 by Albert Günther, which was followed by Whitley. In 1987, Henri Cappetta speculated that it could actually be a misidentified bony fish. Arthrobatis is currently considered to be a tentative batoid, but what taxa it is most closely related to is unknown. It is potentially as old as the Rhaetian, pre-dating the Pliensbachian Antiquaobatis, which would make it the earliest ray.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "In the southeastern border province of Sistan and Balochistan, an attack on an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) headquarters happened on the night of 4 April 2024. At least 11 Iranian security force members were killed in this attack. The clashes occurred in the towns of Chabahar, Rask and Sarbaz. Jaish ul-Adl, a Sunni armed group, was involved in the attack and lost at least 16 members during the clashes. This incident is one of the deadliest attacks carried out by Jaish ul-Adl. The region has a predominantly Sunni Muslim population and has witnessed frequent clashes between Iranian security forces and militants. The attack took place following an Israeli missile strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria that killed Quds Force Brigadier-General Mohammad Reza Zahedi and his deputy, General Mohammad Hadi Hajriahimi.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe area, bordering Afghanistan and Pakistan, has witnessed frequent clashes between Iranian security forces and militants as well as drug traffickers. Over the past decade, Jaish ul-Adl, a Baluchi separatist militant group, has consistently focused its attacks on the Revolutionary Guards in western Balochistan. However, since the \"Bloody Friday\" incident in Zahedan, these assaults have escalated significantly, resulting in large-scale and lethal strikes against Iranian forces. Jaish ul-Adl was one of they terrorist groups that got ahold of weapons left behind after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. The attack came after an Iranian airstrike targeted Jaish ul-Adl operatives, including senior commander Ismail Shahbakhsh, within Pakistani territory. Jaish ul-Adl has launched attacks against Iranian security forces, with a notable incident in December that killed 11 police personnel. The group cites the pursuit of greater rights and improved living conditions for ethnic minority Baluchis in Shi'ite-dominated Iran as their rationale for the attacks. Sistan and Balochistan, one of Iran’s most underdeveloped provinces, houses a discontented local population as a result of government policies. Baluchis, many of whom are Sunni, have faced disproportionate discrimination for a long time. Additionally, they make up about 5% of Iran's population, but account for around 20% of all executions in Iran.\nThe government of Iran is confronting a multitude of challenges: severe international economic sanctions, direct targeting of its interests by Israel in Syria, and ISIS attacks within its borders. Amidst the ongoing turmoil, the insurgency in Sistan and Balochistan has seized the opportunity to apply additional pressure on the struggling government.\n\n\n== Attacks ==\nOn the night of 4 April 2024, the Jaish al-Adl militant group carried out an unprecedentedly complex and sophisticated attack targeting Iranian security forces in southeastern Iran. Coordinated and simultaneous assaults struck at least two Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) headquarters, a police station, and a naval facility in Chabahar, Rask and Sarbaz within Iran's Sistan and Balochistan Province. The attacks, which began around midnight and lasted over 13 hours, resulted in the deaths of 11 Iranian security personnel and 18 Jaish al-Adl militants. The gunmen stormed various security and military compounds, wearing suicide vests, but failed to seize the Guards headquarters. This attack occurred amidst heightened tensions following a suspected Israeli missile strike that hit Iran's consulate in Damascus, for which Iran pledged revenge. The IRGC commander stated that the security forces had freed the people taken hostage by the terrorists.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nIran mobilized its forces to deal with Jaish al-Adl’s attacks at multiple locations. The United Nations Security Council issued a statement condemning the attack. The Council expressed sympathy and condolences to the victims’ families and the government of Iran. It reaffirmed that terrorism poses a serious threat to international peace and security, emphasizing the need to hold perpetrators accountable and bring them to justice. \"Pakistan openly condemns the despicable and cowardly attack on security and police headquarters in the cities of Rask and Chabahar,\" stated an official Pakistani government release.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Room Smash is an action and sandbox game created by Paradyme Games in September 2020.  The game enables players to demolish selected rooms of their choosing. (E.g. subway, supermarket, etc).\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nPlayers have the option to select which room they want to demolish. Upon making their choice, a user interface (UI) appears on the side, featuring six classifications. After clicking on one of these categories, users are presented with additional options. Once a specific option is chosen, players can proceed to destroy the selected room they initially chose.\nIn the game, an Easter egg can be unlocked by destroying an arcade machine within one of the games maps. Once the arcade is demolished, an extra button appears on the main screen. Clicking this button takes the player to an arcade-style game called Raptor Rampage. In Raptor Rampage, players navigate a Velociraptor in a platformer-style game, destroying items within a building to earn points within a set time limit. By collecting a clock with confetti coming out of it, players extend their playtime, allowing them to accumulate more points. Unfortunately, the easter egg has been discontinued from use in the game itself, and the only way to access it is by going through the game's code.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe game has been rated 4.8 on the Apple App Store, 4.6 on Google Play. \nThe game has received a 12+ rating on various app stores for its depiction of fantasy violence, alcohol usage, and realistic violence\n\n\n== See also ==\nCity Smash\n\n\n== References ==",

Born in Lahaina, Hawaii, she represented Maui County in the Hawaii Territorial House of Representatives beginning in 1945, but was ill for much of her term. She died of an intracerebral hemorrhage in 1946 before the term concluded.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nIsabell Namauʻu was born in Lahaina, Hawaii, on May 17, 1891.\nNamauʻu sang at the annual meeting of the Hawaiian Girls' Club in May 1919. On June 25, 1921, a farewell party was held at the Kula Sanitarium for Namauʻu and a colleague, who were both leaving the sanitarium. In July and August 1921, Namauʻu sang Hawaiian music at the daily assemblies of the territory's summer school, which was held at McKinley High School.\nOn December 19, 1921, Namauʻu married prominent rancher Charles Thompson at her home in Lahaina. The couple travelled to Hana to celebrate. At the time of the marriage, Namauʻu was a teacher at the Episcopal School in Lahaina and had previously taught in Kula. She was Thompson's third wife; they had four children together.\n\n\n== Career and death ==\nThompson was elected as a Democrat to represent Maui County in the Hawaii Territorial House of Representatives for a term beginning in 1945. She was unwell for most of her term, and only intermittently present in the legislature.\nOn June 11, 1946, Thompson died of a sudden intracerebral hemorrhage at her home in Kihei. She was 55 years old. Because there were no legislative sessions scheduled before the next general election that November, her seat remained vacant through the end of the term.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Works cited ===",

        "content": "Richard Swanley (died September 1650) was a British Royal Navy commander.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSwanley  is probably to be identified with the Richard Swanley, a commander in the East India Company's service, who in 1623 went out as master of the Great James with Captain John Weddell, and was in her in the four days' fight with the Portuguese near Ormuz, on 1–4 February 1625; but there was another captain of the name in the company's service at the same time, and the identification cannot be ascertained beyond doubt. In the summer of 1642 Swanley commanded the Charles in the Narrow Seas, and took a prominent part in the operations against Chichester, and in the reduction of the Isle of Wight for the parliament. He co-operated with William Waller against Portsmouth, and after its fall on 7 September 1642 summoned Southampton. In the fleet of 1643 Swanley commanded the Bonaventure of 34 guns as admiral of the Irish seas, and for good service in capturing the Fellowship of 28 guns in Milford Haven both he and William Smith, the vice-admiral, were granted by the parliament a chain of the value of 200l. In February 1644 he came off Milford Haven in the Leopard, and his squadron landed two hundred men to assist Colonel Rowland Laugharne against the royalists; and he was next ordered to cruise against an expected attempt from Brittany (Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1 and 15 June 1644). He continued serving throughout the summer, co-operating with the army in Pembrokeshire, and taking care that reinforcements from Ireland should not reach the royalists. One vessel laden with troops he captured, offered the covenant to the English on board, and flung the Irish into the sea (Gardiner, Civil War, i. 337). In the following summer he was again afloat, but in August was, on some charges which seemingly could not be sustained, superseded by Robert Moulton. On investigation it was determined to reinstate Richard Swanley, and he was accordingly appointed to the Lion, in which he continued, still on the same station and on similar service, till towards the end of 1647. He was afloat in July, but in November had left the sea, and in the following January was petitioning to have his accounts passed. For the next few years he resided at Limehouse, where he died in September 1650. He was buried in the churchyard of Stepney (Lysons, Environs of London, iii. 434, Suppl. 1811, p. 441). In his will (in Somerset House: Pembroke 149), dated 28 May 1649, and proved on 11 Sept. 1650, he mentions his wife Elizabeth, a daughter Mary, and two sons John and Richard, the latter of whom may probably be identified with the Richard Swanley bound apprentice to the East India Company in December 1633, who served afterwards in the navy, and was master of the Revenge in 1669.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1898). \"Swanley, Richard\".

        "content": "Ore no Shikabane o Koete Yuke, commonly abbreviated to Oreshika, is a 1999 role-playing video game co-developed by Alfa System, MARS Corporation and Contrail, and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation. A remake for the PlayStation Portable was released in 2011. The story follows a family cursed by the oni lord Shutendoji to have short lives and never have children with mortals. Aided by friendly gods who can help them produce heirs, the family goes on a generations-long quest to defeat Shutendoji. Gameplay combines role-playing mechanics and a turn-based battle system with continuing the family tree through pairings with different gods.\nDesigner Shoji Masuda of MARS Corporation created the original concept, inspired by the idea of a story covering multiple generations. The game began production in 1996. Other staff included illustrator Makoto Sajima, and composer Ryōko Kihara. Both the original and the remake saw strong sales, and met with praise from Japanese journalists for the unique gameplay design. Ore no Shikabane o Koete Yuke saw no Western release due to its focus on Japanese culture. A sequel for the PlayStation Vita, Oreshika: Tainted Bloodlines, was released in 2014 in Japan and 2015 worldwide.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nOre no Shikabane o Koete Yuke is a role-playing video game in which players take on the role of a family in the Heian period in and around the city of Kyoto. The gameplay is focused around the player continuing the family tree; the family is cursed for its members to live only two in-game years, so players must find gods to pair with living members of the family in order to sire the next generation. The god chosen by the player dictates elements of the next generation's appearance, along with their player statistics. During the game, the player party goes into labyrinths around Kyoto, dungeons where they fight enemies to gain strength or progress the narrative. Battles start when making contact with an enemy, entering a dedicated arena; depending what direction an enemy is attacked, the player can gain an advantage.Combat is turn-based, with the player selecting actions including attacking, defending, and using skills. Combat ends when either side is defeated, with the enemy being defeatable by either wiping them out or killing the group's leader. Loot is dictated through a randomized slot machine at the start of combat. After winning, the party is rewarded with two types of experience points; \"war victory points\" increase a character's statistics, while \"dedication points\" allow the family to interact with a wider range of progressively powerful gods to continue the family line. Playable characters also have a character class system, with their job decided by players when they are born, with different weapons impacting their skills and attack range.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nMarried warriors Owa and Genta storm Shutenkaku Castle to defeat the oni lord Shutendoji, who threatens Kyoto and has taken their children hostage. Shutendoji kills Genta and their captured elder daughter, but Owa offers herself to Shutendoji if their surviving child is spared. Shutendoji agrees, but places twin curses on the child in secret; the child can only live two years, and can never have children with a mortal. Concerned at Shutendoji's actions, the gods led by Hiruko Taishoten bless the child, giving them the ability to immediately reach adulthood and permission to have children with gods. With these gifts, the family sets out to fight Shutendoji, who is also cursing earthbound gods across Japan. To aid the family, Hiruko joins them in human form as an aide, and a spirit called Kitsuto acts as a self-proclaimed divine messenger.\nThe family undermine Shutendoji's influence across Japan, then successfully assault Shutenkaku Castle and defeat Shutendoji. Shutendoji is revealed to be the cursed physical form of Kitsuto, Hiruko's twin brother born from a union between a human and a goddess. Harbouring resentment against humans for his mortal family's deaths and the gods who imprisoned him as Shutendoji to control an earlier rampage, he enacted his plans to free himself and torment the family of Owa, revealed to be his aunt in human form. The family pursues Kitsuto, who has been using the captured Owa's power to birth his demon army and control the local gods. During their fight Kitsuto merges with Owa, forcing the family to kill them both. Owa regains her divine form, and takes Kitsuto−reborn as a baby−to heaven to raise him as one of the gods. This action lifts the family's curse.\n\n\n== Development ==\nThe concept for Ore no Shikabane o Koete Yuke was created by designer Shoji Masuda. He first got the idea of a story following multiple short-lived generations after the birth of his second child in 1995. Production began in 1996 in parallel with several other projects. The game was co-developed by Alfa System, Masuda's MARS Corporation, and Contrail, the latter a support division of publisher Sony Computer Entertainment. Masuda had collaborated with Alfa System on a number of game projects including Linda Cube; shared staff with Linda Cube included programmer Hiroshi Hasegawa. Masuda attributed the unusual game premise being greenlit to the optimistic atmosphere in Japanese companies at the time, which were experiencing an economic boom.Masuda drew inspiration from two simulation video games available at the time; Derby Stallion which focuses on breeding successive racehorse generations, and the baseball series Eikan wa Kimi ni which had the team leader change every three years. He combined these inspirations with role-playing elements to create the game's main systems. The game was developed for the PlayStation, with Masuda choosing an older 2D design for its art and battles over then-dominant 3D models. His reasoning was both to keep the speed of battles high, and to emulate traditional Japanese painting. Commenting in 2011 on its similarity to later \"social\" titles, Masuda said the game was aimed at adults only able to play short sessions.The scenario was the last part of the game to be finalized. The character Kitsuto was originally female, but at the request of a senior wanting the game to appeal to female gamers, he was changed to a handsome boy. As with many of Masuda's other games, the content and theme focuses on death, though he called this commonality a coincidence. The Heian setting was chosen over other periods due to the number of folklore and mythology set within that era, and being a time of historical transition in history tying into the theme of generational change. The dungeon areas were all based on pre-existing locations in Japan, such as the Lake Biwa Canal, the Ōeyama Mountains, and various temples across Honshu. Many of the gods' names were either explicit references to pre-existing Japanese deities, such as Hiruko being based on Ebisu, or used word play based on their in-game roles and stories. The characters were designed by Makoto Sajima, an artist who had done work on video games and light novel illustration. When choosing an illustrator, Masuda wanted an artist that could appeal to both manga and anime fans, and the general public. The anime cutscenes were created by Studio Sign.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe music was composed by Ryōko Kihara, who had previously worked in the anime and commercial industry, and composed the score for Linda Cubed. Masuda asked Kihara on board the project after going to a concert featuring her music during the game's planning stage. He positively described her theme as \"rooted in daily life\" and in line with the game's focus on families. Kihara wanted her music to be a \"standard\" that would never grow old for players. The music was arranged by Kazuhiko Toyama, while the main theme \"Hana\" was performed by Gokigen Band. Masuda heard \"Hana\" being performed at a concert by Kihara early in his planning of the game, and immediately asked for its use. He further stated the game's overall tone and theme was inspired by the song, and wrote the lyrics to be simple yet \"powerful\" in meaning. A soundtrack album for the game was published by Sony on July 23, 1999.\n\n\n== Release ==\nOre no Shikabane o Koete Yuke was released on June 17, 1999. Masuda said the title came up during a conversation with manga author Hiroshi Izawa; Masuda was brainstorming ideas with Izawa, and they came up with the title based on the game's premise. The title is often abbreviated to \"Oreshika\", with some Western journalists and fans also using this title. The full title is translated as \"Over My Dead Body\". The game cover and manual notably featured two children, Ichimaru Kurashina and Miki Kurai. They were found and brought in to pose for the cover by Kurashina's father, an art designer whom Masuda met by chance. The game was released as a PlayStation Classic on Japan's PlayStation Network on February 22, 2007.\n\n\n=== Remake ===\nA remake of Ore no Shikabane o Koete Yuke was confirmed at a music concert in March 2011, with a press release containing its platform, information on its content and planned release window. The remake was released on November 10, 2011, for PlayStation Portable. The gameplay changes include status menus for monitoring the family and allied gods, \"techniques\" for use in battle, an ad-hoc multiplayer element which allows players to trade their party members for bonuses, and a post-game challenge mode dubbed \"Ura Kyoto\". Alongside a standard edition, a limited special edition was released which included two new gods also included in first print copies of the standard edition, a soundtrack disc, a booklet featuring behind-the-scenes details, and themed PSP accessories. As part of this special edition, Kurashina and Kurai returned to recreate the original cover art. Free downloadable content was released in 2012 featuring seven further gods for players to interact with.While Masuda and Alfa System were eager to revisit the game, and Masuda attributed Sony agreeing to it to luck and positive changes within the company. He had wanted to create a sequel, but during talks with Sony it was decided to create a remake to both gauge interest in a sequel and revisit mechanics. The multiplayer was restricted to an ad-hoc function due to difficulty maintaining a dedicated server. Most of the work on the remake was described as balancing and adjusting gameplay, as Masuda felt the original was close to ideal. The graphics were redrawn, the aspect ratio expanded from 4:3 to 16:9, the scenario was greatly expanded, the voice overs were re-recorded, and in response to fan requests an epilogue was added to address the original game's abrupt ending. While actors for named characters returned, most of the other characters had new voice actors.Sajima returned as character designer, and Kihara as composer. Masuda wanted all the original songs to be kept, while Kihara insisted on there being new orchestration. She compared the differences between the two soundtracks to different interpretations of the same music from different orchestras. Kihara also contributed new themes, arranged by Konoskee. A soundtrack album for the remake was released on November 23, 2011, by Team Entertainment.It got re-released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on April 17, 2024 in Japan as part of PlayStation Plus Premium Classic Catalog, though it's also available as an individual purchase.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nAccording to Matsuda, the original release only shipped 20,000 copies during its first week. By the end of the year, the game had sold over 137,500 units. Combined with sales of the PlayStation Classic version, the game sold 400,000 copies. Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu felt the game's RPG elements were basic, but that the character growth elements were \"unique\", citing it as an ambitious title. In a retrospective article on the game Inside Games cited it as a highly memorable title from the late PlayStation lifecycle, highlighting the amount of player freedom and its unusual gameplay mechanics.During its opening week, the remake reached third place in sales charts, selling over 94,000 units. It sold just over 140,000 units by the end of 2011. In a pre-release preview, 4Gamer.net highlighted its improved visuals and refined gameplay elements compared to the original. Revisiting the game, Famitsu lauded its replay value and the adjustments to game balance compared to the original, feeling that its mechanics had aged well and remained unique.\n\n\n== Sequel ==\n\nSince its release the title has become a popular favourite in Japan, and Masuda would reference elements of Oreshika in his other work. No version of Ore no Shikabane o Koete Yuke saw an official release outside Japan. During a 2014 interview, Sony studio chief Allan Becker stated that the game was not localized as Sony thought it was \"too 'Japanese' to appeal to a western audience.\" A sequel for the PlayStation Vita was released in 2014 in Japan. It was also released in the West in 2015 under the title Oreshika: Tainted Bloodlines.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (archived 2008)",

        "content": "Parliamentary elections were held in Serbia on 22 May 1901 to elect the members of the National Assembly. They were the first elections held under the 1901 constitution, which provided for a bicameral parliament consisting of a National Assembly and a Senate.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn the summer of 1900 King Alexander I suddenly announced his engagement to  Draga Mašin. Disapproving of this, the government of Vladan Đorđević resigned. A government led by Aleksa Jovanović was appointed in its place, but resigned in March 1901 and was replaced by a coalition government led by Mihailo Vujić. The Vujić government prepared a new liberal constitution, which was promulgated by the king on 6 April.\nThe new \"octroyed\" constitution provided for a bicameral parliament with a fully-elected 130-member National Assembly with a four-year term and a partially elected 51-member Senate (30 members appointed for life by the king, eighteen elected members, the Archbishop of Belgrade, the Bishop of Nis and the crown price) with a six-year term. Elections to the National Assembly were set for May and Senate elections for August.\n\n\n== Electoral system ==\nThe 130 members of the National Assembly were elected from party lists in constituencies based on districts and towns, with seats allocated according to population. Each list was required to have at least one candidate that had graduated from university.\nVoting was restricted to men over the age of 20 who paid at least 15 dinars in taxation, while candidacy was restricted to literate men aged at least 30 who had paid at least 60 dinars in tax. Civil servants, priests and heads of municipalities were not allowed to run for election.\n\n\n== Campaign ==\nThe People's Radical Party and Serbian Progressive Party formed an alliance to contest the elections, even launching a jointly-run newspaper. However, this was opposed by younger members of the Radical Party, who ran as independents in some districts and eventually became the Independent Radical Party.\n\n\n== Results ==\nThe Radical–Progressive alliance received around 130,000 votes, while the Independent Radicals received around 40,000 votes and Liberals 30,000.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAlthough the National Assembly had a four-year term, on 25 March 1903 the king issued a royal proclamation suspending the 1901 constitution and dissolving parliament. He then appointed new members to the Senate. Through a second proclamation 45 minutes later, he reinstated the constitution and called for early elections in May.\n\n\n== References ==",

Her great-grandparents invented the Bigouden picot, which was derived from the Irish picot. Her ancestors embroidered for the likes of the Emperor of Russia. She was the eldest child of Marc Le Berre, who owned the store À la Ville d'Ys in Quimper.> A Breton regionalist, he was a member of the Seiz Breur movement and created the kabic. He would later buy old pieces from Coco Chanel. Her mother, Anne-Marie Kerloc'h, taught her how to be a housewife. In her father's store, she met numerous artists being exhibited, including René-Yves Creston, Géo-Fourrier, Robert Micheau-Vernez, and René Quillivic. Her father told her the tales of François-Marie Luzel, which would inspire her work.\nImpassioned with the arts, she entered the École régionale des beaux-arts de Quimper. During her studies, she frequented the Faïencerie Keraluc, where she gathered inspiration for her works. She was a student of Jos Le Corre and met Gwen Jégou, who she married in 1955. The couple had two children: Tugdual (1956–2018) and Gaïde (1957–2016). Dodik and Gwen opened a ceramics shop in Saint-Malo in 1956, on Place de la Poissonnerie.\nIn 1979, Jégou created Rencontres chez Gwen et Dodik with her husband, which was also known as Le Petit Théâtre de Gwen et Dodik, which hosted artists, poets, writers, singers, and more. They brought in the likes of Pêr-Jakez Helias, Youenn Gwernig, Irène Frain, Glenmor, Michel Le Bris, and performers from the Étonnants Voyageurs. In 1981, she organized the Rencontres Poetiques de Bretagne, also known as the Rencontres poétiques internationales de Bretagne, of which she became director in 1982. In 1984, she participated in a global congress of poets in Marrakesh, led by Léopold Sédar Senghor. In 1986, she hosted Senghor, Pêr-Jakez Helias, and Gérard Le Gouic at Mont-Saint-Michel. For her, \"culture only exists as an exchange, a link, an opening to the world\".\nIn 1990, with the help of the municipality of Saint-Malo, she opened the Maison internatioanle des poètes et des écrivains, inaugurated by Federico Mayor Zaragoza, Director-General of UNESCO, as well as Mayor René Couanau, 1989 Nobel Prize in Literature winner Camilo José Cela, and Édouard Maunick. She directed the house until August 2014, when it was led by Pascal Verdeau, although she maintained de facto leadership. She was also a co-founder and member of the Maison des métiers d'art français and devoted time in 2008 to saving frescos in association with the Amis du peintre Geoffroy Dauvergne.\nDodik Jégou died in Saint-Malo on 2 April 2024, at the age of 89.\n\n\n== Works ==\nNine ceramic frescos in Ruhr\nLa Conception de Merlin\nLa Légende de la ville d'Ys\nLe Barzaz Breizh\nLes Contes de Luzel\n\n\n=== Illustrations ===\nThe Wonderful Adventures of Nils by Selma Lagerlöf\nLes contes de Luzel by Pêr-Jakez Helias\nComment le renard Poil-Roux fut battu à la course par Ventre-à-Terre, l'escargot by Pêr-Jakez Helias\nAngèle by Angèle Vannier\nLe Livre d'Angèle by Angèle Vannier\n\n\n=== Stamps ===\nBarzaz Breiz\n\n\n=== Publications ===\nEntretien avec Mario Vargas Llosa (2003)\n\n\n== Expositions ==\n17 frescos at the Parlement of Rennes (1981)\n40 frescos and ceramic pieces at the UNESCO Headquarters (1985)\nBibliothèque municipale de Rennes (1989)\nInauguration de la Maison des légendes (2001)\nÉglise Saint-Sauveur de Saint-Malo (2021–2022)\nVarious exhibitions in Barcelona, Brussels, Cannes, Deauville, Florence, Frankfurt, London, Lyon, Munich, Paris, Prague, Thessaloniki, Strasbourg, and Stuttgart\n\n\n== Distinctions ==\nKnight of the Ordre des Palmes académiques\nOrder of the Ermine (1997)\nGoursez Vreizh\nMedal of the Ville de Saint-Malo (2021)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Edward Nicholls (fl. 1617) was an English sea captain.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nNicholls in 1616 commanded the Dolphin of London, of about 220 tons, trading to the Levant. She had 19 guns, mostly small, 5 murderers or swivels, and a crew, all told, of 38 men and boys. On 1 January 1616–17 she left Zante, homeward bound, with a full cargo, and on the 12th, being then off the south end of Sardinia, she fell in with a squadron of five Turkish men-of-war, probably of Algiers, all large ships, heavily armed and full of men, and three of them commanded by Englishmen, whose names are given as Walsingham, Kelly, and Sampson. The fight that followed between these pirates and the Dolphin was one of the most remarkable that have been recorded. Over and over again the Turks attempted to board the Dolphin; two or three times they even succeeded in doing so: but the heavy fire kept up from the Dolphin's round-house and close fights forced the enemy to retire with great loss. The Turkish ships were raked through and through, and towards night they drew off, in evident distress, and having lost, it was supposed, a great many men. The Dolphin, too, had suffered a good deal of damage, with seven killed and nine wounded. The next day she put in to Cagliari, where she refitted and buried her dead. On 20 February she sailed for England, and arrived in the Thames without further hindrance. Of Nicholls nothing more seems to be known.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1894). \"Nicholls, Edward\".

Her classically trained performance career as a violinist and electric violinist has led her to record and tour with ensembles specializing in contemporary classical music and hybrid orchestral works.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nAsano began playing violin at age five, in a musical family, by studying the Suzuki method.  She studied at the Berklee School of Music with a dual major in Performance and Professional Music, graduating in 2022.\n\n\n== Career ==\nFirst widespread recognition as a professional violinist came from a viral video in 2021 by Asano, from a cover of “Roses” by SAINt JHN (2018), performed on electric violin.\nAsano has collaborated with Tina Guo, Kiki Wong, and Grace Kelly in performances as the RAMENSTEIN quartet.  Asano toured with Ally the Piper as the duo Mia x Ally, a touring group which performs hybrid orchestral arrangements using electric violin and electric bagpipe.  These collaborations are distinctive for their use of the aggressive tonality, performance, and fashion choices which follow the heavy metal music aesthetic.\nMia Asano participated as a solo violinist on the 2023 Two Steps From Hell tour\n\n\n== Instruments ==\nAsano plays the electric seven-string fretted Viper violin manufactured by Wood Violins.\n\n\n== Recordings ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

The game immerses players into a 2D model representing a small section of a city, granting them the ability to interact with it, mainly through destructive actions.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nIn the game, users have the option to select the city they wish to destroy. Once a city is chosen, the map loads, and a user interface (UI) appears on the side of the screen, featuring six classifications. Upon clicking one of these buttons, users are presented with additional options, enabling them allows the player to destroy the city through various weapons.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe game has been rated 4.8 on the Apple App Store, 4.6 on Google Play. \nThe game has received a 12+ rating on several app stores due to its depiction of fantasy violence and realistic violence. The game also depicts similar scenarios to that of the tragic events that took place during the September 11th attacks in 2001.\n\n\n== City Smash 2 ==\nIn January 2021, the Paradyme Games official YouTube channel teased beta testing of a spinoff game for City Smash, depicting the environment in a 3D format, rather than being in a 2D format.\nIn 2023, the game was officially launched on both the Apple App Store, Googles Play Store, and other miscellaneous app stores. The game's premise involves exploring a city in a 3D environment, while still retaining the same destructive gameplay mechanics as the original game. \n\n\n== See also ==\nRoom Smash\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "George Peacock (1805 – 6 June 1883) was an English sea captain and shipowner.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPeacock born in 1805 at Starcross, near Exeter. He was son of Richard George Peacock, a master in the navy, who had served with Sir Alexander Cochrane in the West Indies, and with Thomas, lord Cochrane, afterwards tenth earl of Dundonald. After the peace his father owned and commanded ships trading to the Mediterranean and Brazil, and young Peacock served his apprenticeship with him, rising gradually to command a ship on a voyage to the Pacific. In 1828 he entered the navy as second master of the steamer Echo, employed in surveying the lower Thames. In the next year he went out to the West Indies in the Winchester, and in March 1831 was appointed acting-master of the Magnificent, from which he exchanged into the Hyacinth as a sea-going ship. While in the Hyacinth he surveyed the harbour of San Juan de Nicaragua, his chart of which, with later corrections, is still in use. He also, in an official letter, pointed out the advantages of the route across the isthmus from San Juan, and recommended Colon, then known as Victor Cove, as a terminus for a railway. He seems to have persuaded himself that in this he made an original discovery; but the routes he recommended were known to the Spaniards from the earliest times, and in after years to Francis Drake, Henry Morgan, and the later buccaneers. On 21 September 1835 Peacock was confirmed as master of the Medea steamer in the Mediterranean, and, while serving on the coast of Greece, made a survey of the isthmus of Corinth, marking the line of a possible canal. A copy of this he presented to the Greek government, in acknowledgment of which the king of Greece in 1882 conferred on him the order of the Redeemer of Greece; at the time, however, in 1836, King Otho, paying a visit to the Medea, presented Peacock with a gold snuffbox.\nIn 1838, being then master of the Andromache, Peacock surveyed and buoyed the harbours of Charlotte-town and Three-rivers in Prince Edward Island. In 1840 he applied to be appointed to the Blenheim, then going to China; his application was refused, and, being offered the command of the steamers of the newly constituted Pacific Steam Navigation Company, he resigned his warrant in the navy. He superintended the building and equipment of the steamers, and himself commanded the first that went out, which he took through the Strait of Magellan. For the next five years he acted as the company's marine superintendent, and claimed to have during this time laid down buoys, erected beacons, built a lighthouse, surveyed harbours, opened and worked coal-mines, discovered new guano-beds, suggested railways, and brought the first regular mails from Valparaiso to Panama. In 1846 he returned to England, and seems to have been busy for the next two years in carrying out experiments with an anti-fouling composition for the bottoms of iron ships, for the manufacture of which he started a company in 1848, under the style of Peacock & Buchan. In 1848 he accepted an appointment as dockmaster at Southampton, the title of which office was afterwards changed to superintendent of the docks. He held this till 1858, when he retired to Starcross, and carried on business there as a shipowner.\nIn 1859 he vainly memorialised the admiralty with a view to having his name reinstated on the list of masters. He printed the memorial, letters, and certificates, under the title of ‘Official Correspondence.’ In 1860 he commanded an unsuccessful expedition, under the patronage of Napoleon III, for the discovery of ‘nitrates’ in the Sahara, the idea being, apparently, that they were the natural concomitants of sandy desert. In 1873 he took out a patent for chain cables of a specified pattern, in connection with which he published ‘A Treatise on Ships' Cables, with the History of Chains, their Use and Abuse’ (cr. 8vo). He wrote many other pamphlets, among which may be named ‘The Resources of Peru …’ (cr. 8vo, 1874), which ran through four editions within six months; ‘On the Supply of Nitrate of Soda and Guano from Peru, with the History of their first Introduction into this Country’ (cr. 8vo, 1878); ‘Notes on the Isthmus of Panama and Darien;’ ‘The Guinea, or Gold Coast of Africa, the veritable Ophir of Scripture.’ He died on 6 June 1883, in the house of his son-in-law, Henry Cookson of Liverpool, and was buried at Starcross.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1895). \"Peacock, George (1805-1883)\".

        "content": "M4 Sport is a Hungarian terrestrial television channel owned and operated by Duna Média since 2015. On this channel, events of the 16 prominent Hungarian sports are carried, as well as international sports events, events featuring outstanding Hungarian athletes, and the broadcast of their competitions and championships. All of this includes self-produced shows. M4 Sport provides approximately 10 hours of \"live\" sports broadcasting per day.\nOn July 18, 2020, on the channel's fifth birthday, it was announced that a new channel called 'M4 Sport+ would be launched from September 12. For the time being, the new channel can only be viewed for a limited time, on weekends between 14:00 and 22:00 in the time slot shared with Duna World, not only in Europe, but also in those parts of the world where Duna World's programs are broadcast to Hungarians abroad. The terrestrial coverage of the channel is 99,6% of Hungary's territory. In 2022, the channel had an audience share of 2,7%.\nThe channel's advertising time is sold by Atmedia.\n\n\n== History and technical data ==\nBased on the amended Media Act, service providers were obliged to transmit the subscription-free M4 Sport as of July 1, 2015, in one of the first program slots, just like the other networks of the MTVA, with the exception of M3. On analog networks, the channel mostly replaced Duna World, on digital channels it got a new frequency along with its HD version, including on MinDig TV. Thus, the HD version of Duna World did not have to be transmitted, although it was not discontinued either, because it is still available on some service providers.\nThe channel is also available in HD quality on the Eutelsat 9A satellite (11,958 MHz), also replacing Duna World HD. However, a significant part of the broadcasts here are geoblocked for rights reasons (such as the Formula 1 broadcasts and their special races), so anyone who wants to watch the channel abroad must obtain a code card from the MTVA for this purpose.\nM4 Sport is the first sports television in Hungary, whose programs are subtitled on Teletext, on page 444. MTVA uses an automatic speech recognition system for live broadcasts. Because of this, the subtitles of Duna World have been moved to page 555 since July 1, 2015.\nThe channel identification logo, on the other hand, is not located on the left, but on the upper right corner, like the rest of the public TV broadcasters, due to the uniform appearance of international broadcasts (e.g. Formula 1).\nM4 Sport was the first public television with an independent image since the 2012 image update. Later, the M1, M2 and M5 also got it.\nThe M4 Sport was the first to use a logo different from the first three channels (slanted and non-equal length lines).\nIn the case of parallel broadcasts, the more important event is broadcast by M4 Sport, while the other is usually broadcast by Duna World or Duna. In August 2016, during the Rio Olympics, M4 Sport exclusively broadcast the events of the Olympics, other sports events and M4 Sport's magazine programs were broadcast by M5 during this time.\nFive times a day, it broadcasts the daily current affairs program Egy Perc Híradó of the M1 channel.\nOn June 9, 2021, for the time of the Tokyo Olympics, five new supplementary channels for online pop-up broadcasts were launched, M4 Sport 1, M4 Sport 2, M4 Sport 3, M4 Sport 4 and M4 Sport 5. Their pop-up programs are exclusively available on m4sport.hu is available and contains broadcasts that did not have a place on the terrestrial channels. On June 11, 2021, the channel got a new look, and the studio was also renewed.\n\n\n== Olympic broadcasts ==\nThe summer and winter Olympics were exclusively broadcast on public television in Hungary. This became the case even after the launch of the M4 Sport. The rights were bought from the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the European public service television organization.\nHowever, for the period between 2018 and 2024, Discovery Communications acquired the European television and multiplatform broadcasting rights for the Olympic events, so M4 had to negotiate with them to keep the Olympics available on free platforms alongside the paid pan-European Eurosport.\nThe International Olympic Association has awarded the EBU and Warner Bros. Discovery with all European broadcast rights for the four Olympic Games to be held between 2026 and 2032. The EBU will have the rights to free-to-air broadcasts on television and digital platforms. All EBU members – including M4 Sport indirectly – will provide more than 200 hours of coverage of the Summer Olympic Games and at least 100 hours of the Winter Olympic Games on television, radio, live streaming, and reports appearing on websites, apps and social media platforms. in the framework of Thus ensuring European public television that some of the broadcasts are still available on FTA channels. The paid broadcasts can also be followed on Eurosport this time.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in Hungarian)",

        "content": "Šimānum (also Simanum) was an ancient Near East city-state whose location is not yet known. Its areal location is known to be in the northernmost part of Mesopotamia or the southernmost part of Anatolia, in the vicinity of the Tigris river, north of the Upper Zab river, and near the confluence of the Tigris and eastern Habur river (often confused with the western Habur river off the Euphrates). It is well documented during the time of the Ur III Empire in the late 3rd Millennium BC. It has been proposed that Šimānum was known, under different names, in other periods. If those proposals are correct the site was active from the Akkadian Empire period though the Old Babylonian period. Šimānum is also the name of an Old Babylonian month.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first ruler of Ur III, Shulgi, conducted a number of military campaigns in the northeast region of the empire around Šimānum. Šimānum itself appears to been a vassal rather than a tributary state. Records, in Shugi year 45 and Amar-Sin year 6, report bears being sent to Ur by the ruler of Simanium.\nLate in the reign of Shulgi (c. 2094–2046 BC), continuing into the reign of the Amar-Sin (c. 2046–2037 BC), the daughter of Shu-Sin, Kunši-matum (Submit, O land!) was given to the son of the then ruler of Simanum, Pušam/Bušam, in marriage. Pušam is noted, as ruler of Šimānum, in various Ur III records from the 2nd year of Amar-Sin until the 1st year of Shu-Sin. Pušam is also known from a seal found at Urkesh. In the first year of Shu-Sin Kunši-matum is recorded as being the bride (wife of the ruler) of Arib-atal of Šimānum. Arib-atal was the son of Pušam and brother of Ipḫuḫa. Ipḫuḫa later became ensi of Šimānum, noted in a text from the 1st year of Ibbi-Sin. Arib-atal was denoted as being the \"man\" of Šimānum. There is some debate on the status of Pušam and Arib-atal, ranging from ensi (governor) under Ur to vassal to ruler of an independent though strongly allied state.\nIn the second year of his reign, Ur III ruler Shu-Sin (c. 2037–2028 BC) launched an attack on polities to the north, including Simanum, Habura, and Mardaman.\n\n\"... (Sü-Sín)..., [the fl]ood which overwhelms the disobedient  king (and) the rebel land, whose orders make the foreign country tremble, whose strength is outstanding his daughter was given as a bride to Simànum  [Simanu]m, [Habur]a, (and) [the surrounding districts, rebelled against the king]. They ch[as]ed his [daughter] away from [her] residence. ... He smote the heads of Simânum, Habura, and the surrounding districts. He returned his daughter to her residence. He assigned to her service Simânum, Habüra, and the surrounding districts. He settled the enemy people, his booty, (namely) Simânum, for the god Enlil and the goddess Ninlil, on the frontier of Nippur, (and) built for them [a town]. He set (them) apart for them (Enlil  andNinlil). The god of their town was Sü-Sín. ...\"\n\nRoyal inscriptions record that this attack resulted from the royal family of Šimānum, allied to and intermarried with Ur, being overthrown. Success was reported to the capitol and a reward \"for the messenger Lugal-sisa who brought the good news of the defeat of Simanum\". This attack was marked in two of his year names (SS3 and SS4).\n\nmu Dszu-Den.zu lugal ur2iki-ma-ke4 si-ma-num2ki mu-hul - Year Shu-Sin the king of Ur destroyed Šimānum\nmu us2-sa Dszu-Den.zu lugal ur2iki-ma-ke4 si-ma-num2ki mu-hul - Year after the year Shu-Sin the king of Ur destroyed Šimānum\nThe later year name was only used for the early part of the year before being superseded. One record reports that daughter Kunši-matum was restored to the throne of Šimānum after the successful attack. In any event, correspondence between Ur and Šimānum continue until the early part of the reign of Ibbi-Sin (c. 2028–2004 BC).\nUr III ruler Shu-Sin, after destroying Šimānum settled the prisoners of that war in a town he founded near Nippur that he called Šimānum (sometimes called E-Šu-Suen). This practice for disposition of prisoners continued into the first millennium. Texts from Drehem, near Nippur, record a number of cases of \"individuals of \" being used as guarded workers, some of them acquired for a price. Early during the reign of the next, and last, Ur III ruler, Ibbi-Sin, Ur lost control of the Nippur area and the last record from this prisoner town is dated to the 4th year of Ibbi-Sin.\nA tablet from Irisaĝrig dated to the 5th year of Shu-Sin recorded rations going to \"ĝuruš from Simanum\".\n\n\n=== Ašimānum/Asimānum ===\nAsimānum is known from the Akkadian Empire period and is typically assumed to be Šimānum. A fragmentary text of ruler Naram-Sin reports\n\n\"... He (Naram-Sin, went) from  Asimanum to Sisil. At Sisil he  crossed the Tigris River and (went) from Sisil to the side of the  Euphrates River. He crossed the Euphrates River and (went) to Basar, the Amorite  mountain. ...\"\n\n\n=== Šināmum ===\nThe poorly attributed Šināmum (now thought to be at Üçtepe Höyük), active during the Old Babylonian period, has been pointed to as possibly being Šimānum i.e. \"Although  it  seems  probable  that  Ur  III  Shimanum,  Old  Assyrian  Shimala,  Old  Babylonian  Shinamum  and  Neo-Assyrian  Sinabu  are  one  and  the  same  place\" though this has now lost favor. One of the few textual references was found at Tell Shemshara.\n\n\"... Another matter: the lands of Šinamum and Tušḫum are on a par with Elaḫut itself; but there is no prince (madārum) guiding it, so they are looking to Elaḫut for leadership. If my lord would order it, my messengers should keep on going to these people, so that with 20 manas of silver I could bribe them and make them the enemy of the ruler of Elaḫut in a very short time.   ...\"\n\n\n=== Šibaniba/Šibānum ===\nIt has been proposed that Šibaniba (Šibanibe in the Neo-Assyrian period), known in the Middle Assyrian period and thought to be at the site of Tell Billa, was earlier known as Šimānum though scant Ur III or Akkadian Empire period remains were known from there, the excavations being thinly published, and the areal location is not favorable.\n\n\n== Location ==\nWhile the rough areal location of Šimānum is known and a number of sites have been proposed all that is known about its specific location is that it was very near the 3rd millennium BC city of Habüra which was in turn near to the city of Maridaman (usually assumed to be the Middle Assyrian period Mardaman).\n\n\n=== Near Habura ===\nŠimānum is known to be near the city Ur III period city of Habüra (Ha-bu-raki) which lay on the Habur river a tributary of the Tigris river (not to be confused with the western Habur river, off the Euphrates), at or near this confluence. In one text it is called \"apqum sa Habür\" (source of the Habür). In particular the large site of Basorin Tepe (also Basorin Hoyuk) has been proposed. Basorin has also been proposed as the site of Kipšūnu and of Šabīrēšu. Shamsi-Adad I, ruler of Ekallatum, campaigned against a city of Haburâtum, generally thought to be Habüra. Haburâtum is also known from Mari texts and was near to Razama and Burullu. The location of Haburâtum was near the Habur, off the Tigris. It has also been speculated that the god Ḫabūrītum was from the city of Habüra. In a text of Samsi-Addu found at Tell Shemshara it states\n\n\"... As to Kušiya, why does he remain there? Give him instruction and send him to me by the [x] day of the month, before your mountains and roads get icy: From Zasli to Šegibbu; from Šegibbu to Zikum; from Zikum to Uraʾu; from Uraʾu to Lutpiš; from Lutpiš to the land of Ḫaburatum. Now, if otherwise, because your mountains and roads are already icy so that he cannot travel, let him stay with you. Make it your responsibility to provide him and his servants food and drink (“bread and beer”). Do release the people of the bearer of this tablet of mine.\"\n\n\n=== Near Mardaman ===\nThe linkage with Mardaman (presumed to be Maridaman) is based on its listing with Habura in a later Shu-Sin military campaign primarily against Simaski.\n\n\"(As for) the [pe]ople  of Ha[bura] and [Maridaman,  Sü-Sín,  [ki]ng of the black-headed people, raised servitude for them (and) co[vered] (them with it) as with a garment. In order to mine silver (and) gold he set them (to work there (in Zabasali) from there (Bulma).\"\n A location for Mardaman north of the modern city of Mardin in the Cizre region of Anatolia early on proposed based on the similarity in names but has since been discounted. More recently, the site of Bassetki has become generally accepted based on tablet found there in 2017.\n\n\n=== Other proposals ===\nAssuming the correspondence to Asimānum is correct, the location is thought to be near to the cities of Sisil and Talmuš, also unlocated (Gir-e Pān is proposed for Talmus).\nSinan on the confluence of Batman River and Tigris near the present Bismil in Turkey has been proposed.\nA location in the \"vicinity of Assur\" has been proposed. A related suggestion was \"north of Nineveh\".\nAt one time Tell Hamoukar was suggested based on its size and location.\nA recent proposal, based on the location and the similarity of names Šibaniba and Šimānum, is the site of Tell Billa\n\n\n== See also ==\nCities of the Ancient Near East\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nGarfinkle, Steven, \"The Participation of Marginal and Liminal Groups in Secondary State Formation under the Third Dynasty of Ur\", Journal of Ancient Near Eastern History, vol. 9, no. 2, pp. 305–317, 2022\nLafont, Bertrand, \"Women at Work and Women in Economy and Society during the Neo-Sumerian Period\", The Role of Women in Work and Society in the Ancient Near East, edited by Brigitte Lion and Cécile Michel, Berlin, Boston: De Gruyter, pp. 149–173, 2016",

        "content": "Mongolian rap, or Mongolian hip-hop, is a musical genre that appeared at the end of the 1980s in Mongolia, during a period in which the Mongolian communist regime was weakening and new opportunities for expression were developing. The Har Sarnai (Black Rose) group, created in 1991, entirely at odds with the existing musical standards, played a major role in the development of this style. At the beginning of the 2000s, a new generation of artists offered music with varied influences, but since then this diversity has tended to decrease somewhat with greater attention paid to the American model. Female rappers are rare due to social pressure.\nMongolian rap is a reappropriation of the styles of American hip-hop. It partly uses the same visual codes, such as the symbolic practice of dramatized conflict, loose sports clothing, jewelry, provocative behavior and images, crews, etc. It also incorporates Mongolian cultural references such as Khöömii (throat singing) and Morin khuur, a traditional musical instrument. References to the Mongolian Empire and in particular to the figure of Genghis Khan, a nationalist guardian figure in modern Mongolian society, are frequent. Costumes and references to Mongolian society are evident in song titles and lyrics.\nThe subjects covered are very diverse, though many productions have romantic love as their subject. Political demands and protest messages are also often addressed. In certain songs, perhaps echoing American rap, women are objectified. Another theme regularly addressed is that of the authenticity of the Mongolian people. It is nationalist in nature, and has its roots in the search, since the fall of the communist regime, for a national identity. It involves the denunciation of mixing between Mongolians and other peoples, the fight against immigration (especially Chinese) and the rejection of foreign investments. A more moderate position promotes the development of the Mongolian people on their own and an end to blaming others.\nThe Mongolian language is widely used, but other languages, especially English, which is well-integrated into the local linguistic landscape, are also used. English is used as a tool that artists use and manipulate for various purposes, sometimes by means of the invention of anglicized Mongolian terms, to meet the needs of their artistic approaches. The use of coarse language is seen as making it possible to give more reality to texts and to better understand the urgency of certain messages.\nWith the development of the Internet and other technologies at the end of the 1990s, the spread of Mongolian rap has increased and some artists have had the opportunity to perform abroad.\n\n\n== Motivations and independence ==\n\nThe communist regime for some time sought to ban access to Western popular music, wary of its ideological message. However, from the mid-1960s, it began to penetrate Mongolia from Mongolians returning to the country, spreading covertly among young people, first in the capital Ulaanbaatar. The Mongolian government then chose to support this musical movement by appropriating it and creating tightly controlled pop music groups. In the mid-1980s, these groups began to emancipate themselves, taking advantage of the political decline. Some of their songs were taken up by young demonstrators who, in 1990, in the midst of the collapse of the USSR, obtained the resignation of the communist authorities without violence. The transition to a democratic nation with a free market economy began. Government control over migration eased considerably and a significant part of the rural population invested in Mongolian cities, notably Ulaanbaatar, profiting from the employment opportunities offered by the new economic system. In 2010, more than two thirds of Mongolians were urban and almost half the population lived in the capital.\nMongolia is one of the youngest countries in the world with 75% of the population under 35 years old. Unlike rural youth who still live in a traditional way of life, urban youth are largely open to external cultural influences, which have resulted in their multilingualism. If Western pop music was already accessible before 1990, the democratic revolution greatly facilitated access. Youth quickly took on these influences, moving from consumers of the global popular music scene to producers, experimenting with numerous musical styles, playing with these means of expression while adapting them to local contexts. Around 1990, some artists produced covers of popular Western songs in Mongolian or English. Others have integrated political and societal messages into their songs, such as the defense of democracy and freedom, or cultural ones such as the life of Genghis Khan. The opening of Mongolia to the West has led to the appearance of musical scenes creating a hybrid betwee foreign influences and typically Mongolian sounds, themes and styles. Foreign languages, notably English, and Mongolian are used together.\nThe economic difficulties resulting from the transition from a centralized and planned economy to a market economy, which notably made musical instruments very expensive, led to the disappearance of many groups in the early 1990s. At the end of this decade, the situation of artists previously dependent on Ulaanbaatar - rural communities not having the means to pay the ticket for a concert - improved with the emergence of computers, cable television, urban radios and the Internet. In addition, many companies have begun sponsoring artists, benefiting in return from association with these artists.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nRap, very different from typical Mongolian productions, had great difficulty establishing itself. The first Mongolian rap group was MC Boys, which appeared at the end of the 1980s. It addressed societal, philosophical subjects and rebellion. It was quickly followed, starting in 1991, by the group Har Sarnai (Black Rose). Formed by two brothers, it offered loud and raw music with house rhythms, which they describe as techno-rap. Anthony J. Fonseca describes their style as a combination of disco and electronic dance music, Gregory Delaplace as an mixture of electronic music, rap and pop. They sang or even shouted in a guttural and growling voice (throat singing), constantly exchange words, dealing with the dark sides of life and love. They appeared on stage in fantastical costumes, militaristic uniforms, leather boots, face paint, long wigs and top hats, constantly moving with their fists and feet in the air. In the opinion of music historian Peter K. Marsh, they \"marked a clear alternative to the refined, well-coiffed and well-behaved ballad singers that had dominated the musical main-stream until then\" and \"helped to clear a space for a new generation of rappers.\"\n\n\n=== Development ===\nRap began to truly find its audience from the beginning of the 2000s with the advent of a new generation to which the groups Digital and Tatar belonged. Young artists took advantage of rap music and hip-hop culture to translate their hopes, fears and frustrations into forms previously unavailable in mainstream music. Initially confined to the capital where it appeared, Mongolian rap then spread to the rest of the country, reaching rural youth.\nBetween 1997 and 2002, Dain Ba Enkh (War and Peace) sang on political and societal subjects to music with Western RnB and disco-funk rhythms. Enkhtaivan, active during the 2000s, was the first solo RnB and rap singer. The groups MonTaRap, Lumino and the singer Aka Odko adopted RnB forms, the group Quiza used G-funk music, the singer Gee and the group Ice Top use forms of Gangsta rap and hardcore rap. The group Vainquish chose a grand sound elaborated with synthesizers and a Roland TR-808 drum machine. Since the 2010s, XL, Metune and others have employed traditional instruments and throat singing. These two local elements are regularly associated with hip-hop music. Some female rappers appeared, such as the artist Gennie.\n\nIn the early 2000s, it was not uncommon for Mongolian lyrics to be based on well-known American music: Bi hendch hereggüi (I'm Useless, 2001) by Ice Top used What's the Difference (1999) by Dr. Dre, and Lumino's Hüniih ([She's] Someone Else, 2004), one of the group's big hits, borrows I Know What You Want (2003) from Busta Rhymes and Mariah Carey. While the original lyrics of What's the Difference are about denigration and boasting, the Mongolian version expresses personal inadequacy. In the second case, the original text is an affirmation of erotic art while the Mongolian text is a rejected declaration of love. The influences are not only American. Thus, French rappers sometimes serve as a reference: MonTaRap in Minii Benz (2002) reinterprets Ma Benz (1998) by NTM, and Tatar uses in a song the alternation of a low, sometimes guttural voice, inspired by that of Joey Starr (NTM), and a strong and higher voice comparable to that of Akhenaton (IAM).The voice is consider a genuine instrument. In the early 2000s, Ice Top pushed it to its limits. Listening is, in the opinion of Grégory Delaplace, \"musical experiment that takes language to its animal frontier\".\n\n\n=== Americanization ===\nThe variety of style seen initially tended to diminish somewhat thereafter. Gregory Deplaplace wrote in 2014 that Mongolian rap became Americanized as it developed and approached Eminem's model. The singer Gee, with his even steady flow and rough but clear voice, is an embodiment of this. This movement does not prevent innovations in the use of language like Neg ödriin haan (King for a day, 2010) by Rokit Bay. Finally, Gee himself sometimes uses traditional musical instruments such as the morin khuur in his music as well as khöömii (throat singing). Even a Mongolian artist like TulgaT who lives in Los Angeles and sings in American English maintains his own style.\n\n\n== Visual and cultural aspects ==\nRap is a musical movement in which artists interact with the global forms of the hip-hop movement, mainly influenced by the culture of the African-American community where it was born in the 1970s, and which remains a defining reference, while rooted in the local social, economic, cultural and political context of the country where it is practiced. Mongolian rap is therefore a reappropriation of the styles of American hip-hop into a local context.\n\n\n=== Références visuelles au hip-hop américain ===\n\nThe Mongolian rap scene uses visual references to the American hip-hop movement such as graffiti, which it appears on album covers or on murals, or the use of the American Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics label. Intended to warn of potentially shocking lyrics, it is misused by a number of rappers from America and other regions of the world to demonstrate quality.\nMongolian artists also create characters in the \"gangsta\" or \"bad boy\" style, which refer to the symbolic practice of dramatized conflict. They can thus dress in loose sports clothing, often bearing logos of American sports teams, or in tight-fitting leather jackets and pants, and some display jewelry (rings, necklace chains) or piercings and tattoos. Others have baseball caps worn backwards or sideways. Rappers also adopt the stage gestures, swearing and obscene motions seen in Western rap videos and use visuals such as counting stacks of banknotes or imitating snorting cocaine in their music videos or on the covers of albums. This is for Mongolian rappers to \"align their art with international hip-hop customs while also allowing them to differentiate it from other mainstream Mongolian pop song genres.\"\n\nThese provocations can have had a significant impact. In 2002, the music video for the song Namaig dagaad tsenge (Follow me and have fun) by the group Lumino showed the artists rapping among strippers in a club. The Minister of Justice, deeming it pornographic, banned its broadcast on television channels allied to the political party in power. The Streisand effect ensured the success of the video and the album and reinforced the group's rebellious image. A new version with \"Censored\" labels was released as a mockery.Among American rappers, the concept of collective, of gang or \"crew\", is borrowed from the language of the ghetto, and designates a kind of family helping each other and sharing a set of dress, body or gesture symbols. It is only partially taken up by Mongolian rap groups, generally failing to have such a defined system of identity marks. Among these crews, one of the most famous is Click Click Boom, which also includes a graffiti artist and a morin khuur player, which thus reinforces its aesthetic distinction. Another, created by Gennie, Yudenten (The Hoodies), travels through rural Mongolia in search of talented young rappers.\n\n\n=== Influence of Genghis Khan ===\nOne of the characteristic features of Mongolian hip-hop is frequent references to the Mongol Empire. On a cover of the album Lamba guian Nulims by the group Lumino, the three members of the group, in bad boy posture, are dressed in warrior costumes harkening back to the time of Genghis Khan, the \"bad boy of history\". according to geographer Patrick Rérat. This reference to Genghis Khan is part of a revaluation of Mongolia's past and in particular of its guardian and essential figure, after the fall of the Mongolian communist regime. Previous policy prohibited the evocation of this character, previously venerated, for fear that his deification would awaken Mongol nationalism and inspire desires for autonomy. The upheavals which followed the establishment of a more open political and economic regime were accompanied by the search for a national identity: \"In a few years Genghis Khan once again became the symbol of the unity of the nation, of its strength, of its ability to surpass internal divisions and overcome the vicissitudes of history\", \"he is the symbol of the time when steppe horsemen ruled half of the known world\". For example, in 2002, the first stone of a giant memorial was laid in the capital. A second monument was erected in 2006. Intellectuals such as the writer Galsan Tschinag criticize this cult, supported by the Mongolian state considering it to be an exaltation of a past intended to make people forget through dreams the difficulties of the country, particularly its impoverishment. This is accentuated by climatic problems leading to the death of livestock, which leads to a settling of nomads and therefore anarchic urban growth of the capital.\n\nReferences to the Mongol Empire are very numerous in Mongolian rap, even if they are not exclusive to this genre of music. In the early 2000s, the group Har Sarnai wore the clothes of Mongolian warriors during its concerts and performed choreographies mixing hip-hop dance and traditional dance. In its album covers, the Tatar group, named after a people whom Genghis Khan integrated into his empire and who provided numerous fighters, represents characters from the conquests by drawing inspiration from the technique and aesthetics of graffiti. The traditional writing borrowed from the Uyghurs under Genghis Khan, rejected during the communist period from 1941 in favor of Cyrillic, is also given pride of place on the covers even if it is little used in daily life. During the reign of this emperor, Tibetan Buddhism appeared. Repressed during the Stalinist period, it experienced a renaissance in the early 1990s. The album Lamba guian Nulims (The tears of Mr. Lamba) by Lumino, refers to a Buddhist book very popular in the 1920s, \"The tears of a monk \".\n\n\n== Lyrics ==\n\n\n=== Variety of subjects ===\nMongolian rappers tackle a wide variety of subjects. The most widespread among all rappers (with the exception of Gee) is romantic love, even if, in the opinion of Grégory Delaplace, the subject is not developed in the most profound and the most varied manner. In this theme, the pain of love is regularly addressed, mainly from the male point of view, because female artists are rare. This theme is treated in a darker way than in the pop and pop-rock genres. Sexual attraction, casual romance, celebration of youth and partying, declarations of principle, the city of Ulaanbaatar, etc. are other chosen themes.In certain songs, Mongolian rap participates, through its references to the great moments of its history, in the nationalist revival of Mongolia. It is also a vector of political demands and protest messages, addressing corruption in the political world, the inaction of politicians, foreign investments, insensitivity to the suffering of the poor, unemployment, poverty, alcoholism, or single mothers. These songs can be associated with video clips filmed in the dark and desolate spaces of abandoned or dilapidated buildings. Mongolian rappers feel an obligation to empower and teach younger generations. The incorporation of the rappers' personal experience aims to reflect reality. In the song UU (Drink), Gee addresses the scourge of alcoholism in Mongolia and uses a few expletives to emphasize the urgency of his message.\nIn other lyrics, male rappers judge women in their work or behavior and tell them what to do, or depict them as \"bitches\", trophies, or weapons with which to attack their male enemies. It could be that this is just a cover of American hip-hop themes. Unlike men, who are expected by Mongolian society to be independent, aggressive, and loud, female artists face family and societal pressures to make them family-centered and selfless, qualities that go against the nature of the hip-hop lifestyle according to Wallace Quinn Graham. Many women therefore stop after one to two years of rapping.\n\n\n=== Patriotism ===\nA central concern specific to many Mongolian rap lyrics, but also to many other areas of society, is that of authenticity, or how to be an authentic Mongolian. This question finds its origins in the rise of nationalism which followed the end of the communist regime. \"Mongolian identity is more and more linked with the possession of a \"pure blood\" –something that is denied to children of mixed descent and to ethnic \"minorities\" in the Western provinces or in Inner Mongolia, who are disqualified as \"Mongols\" in the full sense of the term.\" Cultural preservation involves, among other things, the transmission of blood through generations, a nationalist and eugenic idea perfectly illustrated by the song Iluu (Superior, 2009) by Ice Top, where it is sung that the Mongolian man and the Mongolian race is superior.\nHowever, it is above all the obstacles to the practical application of Mongolian identity in today's world, more than its definition, that interest rappers. Among these obstacles to this achievement are the government, through its corruption and inaction, and Chinese immigration from which it is believed Mongolians will become a minority and the country's resources will be consumed. Ice Top and Dain ba Enh, in their duet 76 — the number of deputies to the State Great Khural — take up these themes. Rapper Gee is particularly intense in his attacks against China and does not hesitate to invoke the figure of Genghis Khan. This hatred of China can go as far as calling for murder, as the group 4 Züg (Four Directions) does. However, such songs are not common. In these denunciations, the rappers believe that they are the voice of the majority against that of illegitimate minorities. A third reason is given for what is preventing Mongolians from realizing their potential as a nation: the Mongols themselves. The Tatar group developed this more moderate position in several songs, notably Hün hüneeree bai (Be your own person) which propelled them to fame at the age of 18. According to this group, Mongolians must take their own responsibilities by no longer looking for fault elsewhere, by not trying to take advantage of others and by ceasing to cling to crazy dreams and beliefs.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\nThe harshness of the Mongolian language makes Mongolian rap difficult to hear and understand, according to rapper Tsetse. On the contrary, rapper Gennie considers it suitable even if the music is inevitably harsh. Due to the lack of words that rhyme together in the Mongolian language, most rappers do not attempt to make their verses rhyme. Critics of Mongolian rap deplore the use of crude vocabulary, but these words are considered useful for expression by the artists, even if their use should be downplayed according to some. They \"are reflective of hip-hop\nculture’s values of truthfulness, freedom, and independence\" according to Tsetse.\n\nFor many rappers, French, Japanese, Spanish, Korean and Russian but especially English are used to name groups and artists (for example, in English: Range, Ice Top, Gee, Click Click Bloom, BBChain, Oppozit; in Spanish: Quiza), song titles and sometimes for writing lyrics. The lyrics of the songs are, while generally in Mongolian, in some cases are entirely in English. In Mongolia, English has been integrated into the local linguistic landscape since the end of the communist regime and holds an important place in daily life. If the use of English in a song is well accepted when it comes to a pure language, standard English, it is not always so when it comes to African-American vernacular English and can it can lead to criticism when this dialect is integrated into a Mongolian song. The rapper Gennie experiences this in her song with a nationalist theme, but with the English title Don't Cry. It has been accused of trying to imitate American rap. She defended herself by explaining that she is not manipulated by English, but that it is she who manipulates it. The use of English in Mongolian rap is a part of several strategies. It is a way to identify with a transnational musical scene (British English, African-American vernacular English, etc.) or to differentiate oneself from other English-speaking musicians. It is also a symbolic resource for revealing a \"foreign voice\" or an imaginary foreign subject; it is a space of freedom allowing the expression of taboo and disturbing aspects of Mongolian culture. Finally, it is used for the invention of anglicized Mongolian terms, incomprehensible to English speakers, and which require knowledge of the local culture to be understood.\n\n\n== Authenticity ==\nMongolian rap arouses criticism from older generations of musicians, who see it only as a copy of American models and the result of brainwashing by American hip-hop, but also from defenders of traditional culture: Mongolian rap artists are accused of distorting Mongolian language and culture. Critics also point out that cultural backgrounds are different. There is a mix of the population in the different districts of Ulaanbaatar. Ghettos linked to racial, ethnic or socio-economic class are absent. In addition, Mongolian rappers generally come from the middle class, are mostly educated, and have never had difficult living conditions, which, according to these artists, is due to the fact that the poor do not have the ways to launch an artistic career. Artists who have had a difficult career like Gee, who grew up in a Ger Khoroolol, a neighborhood of yurts, are particularly admired by their colleagues. Other rappers are considered commercial and called fake by other lesser known artists who consider that they degrade the quality of the music and make it less credible.\nIn response to criticism of the authenticity of Mongolian rap, Peter K. Marsh points out that rappers believe that rap is both authentic and real in Mongolia, that they do not seek to strictly copy American rap but to develop a space for artistic expression to defend problems that seem important to them and which are not addressed by others. For many artists, rap is perfectly suited to the realistic expression of social criticism; while, in the opinion of rapper Batorgil from the group Ice Top, Mongolian pop-rock which only sings about love. The public following Mongolian rap expects serious lyrics as is often the case in American rap. For Sender Dovchin, Mongolian rap is a transmodal art, a recombination of linguistic resources (Mongolian, English, French, etc.), traditional elements (throat singing, Mongolian musical instruments), nationalist symbols, cultural heritage, transgressions, behavioral attitudes, which make Mongolian hip-hop a way of life in its own right.\n\n\n== Spread ==\nTechnological means such as the Internet, in particular social media sites such as YouTube and Facebook, have improved the visibility and quality of productions, facilitated contacts between fans and artists or between artists, while making competition between artists more equitable, the support of a producer or a music label no longer being obligatory. These media also offer greater artistic freedom, with commercial logic no longer constraining production.\nMongolian rap is heavily marketed in Mongolia and many rappers sell at least some of their songs, if only to survive economically. A few rare exceptions like the rapper Gennie refuse this commercialization.\nThe diffusion of Mongolian rap goes beyond national borders. It is thus integrated into the network of the Asian musical world and groups like Lumino and Tatar have given concerts in China, Japan and South Korea and even, for the group Lumino, in the United States with the Mongolian diaspora. Rapper Gennie was invited to the United States by a rock guitarist to collaborate and record music. She also participated, in France, in the Mongolian-French hip-hop festival Hos Ayas. This event features prominently in the documentary Mongolian Bling (Ghazarian & Binks, 2012), the subject of which is Mongolian rap.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== Note ===\n\n\n=== Articles ===\nDelaplace, Gregory (2014). \"The ethics and esthetics of Mongolian hip-hop\". gendai Mongoru o shiru tame no 50 shô [Understanding Mongolia in 50 Chapters] (in Japanese). pp. 269–302.\n\nSender Dovchin (2011). \"Performing Identity Through Language: The Local Practices of Urban Youth Populations in Post-Socialist Mongolia\" (PDF).

The species' close proximity and similarity to Cuzcodinella oryx suggests ecological barriers like metamorphic soil led to speciation.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Start was a weekly popular and entertainment magazine targeting men, in circulation between 1969 and 1991 in Zagreb, Yugoslavia. The magazine is known for its unique position in a Communist country featuring both erotic and pornographic content and quality articles on current affairs with detailed analyses.\n\n\n== History and profile ==\nStart was established in 1969 as a successor to the Moto magazin. The first issue of Start appeared in January that year. It was headquartered in Zagreb and was published by Vjesnik which was a well-known publishing house in the country. The first issue described it as \"a magazine for every family, and for each of our citizens.\" However, it was also added in the same issue that the magazine content included all topics \"that interests a modern man.\" The magazine came out weekly.\nIn the initial phase Start was designed based on Playboy, Lui and Penthouse. During this period its cover pages featured nude photographs of women, one of which was the French actress Maria Schneider. Following the change of its editor-in-chief in 1973 Start was redesigned becoming a political and cultural magazine which was modeled on the German magazine Stern.  \nStart contained erotic and pornographic materials in addition to the critical and comprehensive analyses on current affairs, science and art. The latter became dominant from 1973. One of its most significant sections was the interviews which featured both interviews with Yugoslavian leading figures and translations of the interviews from foreign magazines. It also published literary works most which were the examples of a genre called \"jeans-prose\". Later its focus was exclusively on current affairs. Start frequently published materials from Ms., an American magazine, and contained articles on feminism most of which were written by Jasenka Kodrnja and Maja Miles. Vesna Kesić and Slavenka Drakulić were other contributors of the magazine.\nMladen Pleša was appointed editor-in-chief of Start in 1980 and then, the magazine began to target young readers featuring articles on rock music, modern art and fashion.\nAs of 1984 Start sold 200,000 copies half of which were bought by the Serbians. The magazine enjoyed higher levels of circulation during its run. Start folded in 1991.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Alaura Sharp is an American college basketball coach and is the current head coach of the Appalachian State Mountaineers women's basketball team. She previously served as the head coach of the Presbyterian Blue Hose women's basketball team from 2018 to 2024. At Presbyterian, she led her team to their first ever NCAA Tournament and their first ever NCAA tournament win when they beat the Sacred Heart Pioneers 49–42 in a First Four matchup.\n\n\n== Coaching career ==\nSharp played basketball for the women's basketball team at Southwest Minnesota State University. After graduation, she landed her first coaching job as an assistant coach at Adams State University. Following a two-year stint at Adams State, Sharp accepted a head coaching position at Lamar Community College in Colorado. At the conclusion of the 2008–2009 season, Sharp became the head coach of the women's basketball team at Garden City Community College and remained in that position for four years. During that time she compiled an 83–45 record, defeated 11 nationally ranked teams, and turned the Broncbusters into a top contender each year in the tough Kansas Jayhawk Community College Conference and Region VI.  In 2012–13, Sharp guided Garden City Community College to its best record in school history at 29-4 and a No. 13 ranking in the NJCAA polls.\nFollowing her success at the JuCo level, she was hired as an associate head coach at the University of Southern Mississippi. Following two years and two WNIT appearances with Southern Mississippi University in 2014 and 2015, Sharp took another associate head coach and recruiting coordinator position with the Louisiana Tech Lady Techsters. During her time there, the team reached the 2017 Women's National Invitation Tournament.\nIn 2018, Sharp accepted her first Division I head coach coaching job at Presbyterian. From 2018 to 2024, Sharp won 76 games. During the 2023-2024 season, Sharp guided her team to a 2024 Big South Tournament championship. This secured the Presbyterian women's basketball team's first-ever trip to the NCAA Tournament. During a First Four matchup with the Sacred Heart Pioneers, Sharpe led Presbyterian to their first-ever NCAA tournament victory. Following the play-in game, Presbyterian faced an undefeated  South Carolina Gamecocks team led by Dawn Staley. Although Presbyterian lost by 52 points to South Carolina, Sharp praised Staley for making a pregame visit to talk with her team who was making their first NCAA tournament appearance.\nOn April 5, 2024, Sharp was announced as the new head coach of the Appalachian State Mountaineers women's basketball team.\n\n\n== Head coaching record ==\n\n\n=== NCAA DI ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]",

        "content": "Neapolitan tailoring was born as an attempt to loosen up the stiffness of English tailoring, which did not suit the Neapolitan lifestyle or climate.\n\nVincenzo Attolini, the master tailor at London House in Napoli created the  Neapolitan look featuring slim lines, high armholes, and soft-shouldered jackets. Cesare Attolini helped to promote the Neapolitan silhouette.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe Shoulders: the Neapolitan jacket has no shoulder padding. Neapolitan tailors removed the shoulder padding from their jackets to provide more movement freedom. For this reason, the Neapolitan shoulder on informal jackets is sewn like a shirt sleeve (Italian: spalla a camicia), and it follows the natural curve of the human body rather than giving it shape. This type of sleeve is cut about 10 cm larger than the armhole, and it can be finished with the repecchia – that shirring the tailor creates with the extra fabric. This little flair is known as manica a mappina and gives the jacket a \"rugged\" appearance. For formal occasions, the Neapolitan shoulder features a rollino – a little roll of padding that raises the sleeve head to drape more cleanly.\nThe Sleeves: the Neapolitan sleeve is shorter than that found on other jackets, as Neapolitans like shirt cuffs to show right above their wrists, especially when adorned with cuff-links. The sleeves are cut closer to the arms to avoid extra fabric hanging when these are raised.\nThe Pockets: the pockets of a Neapolitan jackets are curved and applied as patches; the breast pocket is called a barchetta, which means \"little boat\", due to the higher top corner of the pocket, which, along with the rounded bottom, gives it the shape of a stylized boat. The side pockets are equally curved, and their shape recalls that of a pot; hence the name a pignata. Neither feature has any practical functionality, but they are particular to Neapolitan tailoring and contribute to the look of a jacket made in Naples. Double-hand finished stitching may also run throughout the sides of the patch pockets – a recurring feature in informal Neapolitan tailoring.\nThe Lining: lining is considered an unnecessary burden, and the Neapolitan tailors keep it as minimal as possible. Usually, the jacket is unlined or only half lined; even the sleeves are entirely unlined, as they're meant to fit closely. Additionally, the lining is often left open (volante, literally \"flying\") so that people can admire the fine details and construction of the jacket.\nThe Lapels: Neapolitan jackets are famous for their wide lapels, which are often peaked (a punta) for double-breasted jackets, formal jackets, and coats. The risvolto dentellato (the \"classic\" style of lapels – not peaked) is wider in Neapolitan jackets: they can be as wide as 4 inches (compared to the 3 inches of a regular lapel width). Just as is the case for the pockets, the Neapolitan lapel features double stitching running along the sides – a peculiar detail of a Neapolitan creation – although reserved for the less formal pieces. The scollo a martiello (literally \"hammer neck\") is the opening of the jacket over the shirt, which in Neapolitan tailoring is parallel to the lapels. The cran is the space that separates the lapel and the neck, and it is usually higher in Neapolitan tailoring to create the illusion of a more slender figure.\nThe Body: Neapolitan jackets tend to be shorter in the back; in Neapolitan dialect, they say the jacket zompa arrèto, which roughly translates as \"it jumps in the back\". This characteristic allows the jacket to \"slide\" gracefully along the body. The vents on the sides are pretty deep in Neapolitan jackets – up to 12 inches. The darts in the front goes all the way down to help the fabric follow the shape of the body and create elegant quarters.\nButtons and Buttonholes: the three-roll-two construction features a lapel that hides the third button to provide extra freedom of movement thanks to a longer opening in the front. The buttonhole on the lapel is called occhiello in Italian, and it means \"little eye\" to its elongated almond shape. There isn't a tradition for a specific type of buttonhole in Naples, but there is a tendency of Neapolitan tailors to prefer slightly shorter and thicker buttonholes that resemble those of a shirt, while \"regular\" buttonholes of English tradition are more elongated and slender. Some tailors add a slight teardrop shape at the end of the buttonhole, an aesthetic choice that does not refer to a particular tradition. The buttons on the sleeves are always working and overlapping buttons.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nISAIA Napoli\nCesare Attolini",

        "content": "The Konstanty Kalinowski Scholarship Program of the Republic of Poland under the Patronage of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland (Belarusian: Стыпендыяльная праграма Ураду Рэспублікі Польшча імя Кастуся Каліноўскага пад патранатам Старшыні Рады Міністраў РП, romanized: Stypiendyjalnaja prahrama Uradu Respubliki Polszcza imia Kastusia Kalinouskaha pad patranatam Starszyni Rady Ministrau RP) is a Polish state aid program for Belarusian youth established in March 2006. Initially intended for students expelled from Belarusian universities for political reasons, over time it also included individuals who cannot study in Belarus due to their political views and involvement in defending democracy and human rights. It is the largest program of its kind in Europe. It is substantively coordinated by the Program Office at the Centre for East European Studies in University of Warsaw, in cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Science and Higher Education. The director and coordinator of the program, overseeing the office's work and the work of the committees qualifying candidates for studies, is the director of the Centre for East European Studies in University of Warsaw, Jan Malicki. The program is funded from the state budget – in 2008, the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs allocated 1.2 million euros for its continuation.\n\n\n== Reasons and circumstances of the creation ==\nOn 19 March 2006, presidential elections took place in Belarus, which according to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and Belarusian opposition organizations were deemed to be falsified in favor of President Lukashenko. This led to the outbreak of social protests, primarily involving young people. The authorities responded to these protests with mass arrests and repression. Those targeted included individuals participating in the protests, as well as those attempting to observe the election process and taking part in the election campaigns of opposition candidates for president: Alaksandar Milinkievič and Alyaksandr Kazulin. One of the main forms of pressure exerted on the youth was the threat of expulsion from their universities, which, in many cases, indeed occurred.\nFaced with this wave of repression, the Polish government and the authorities of Polish universities initiated the establishment of an aid program for Belarusian students expelled from their universities for political reasons. On 30 March 2006, Prime Minister Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz, representative of the United Democratic Forces of Belarus Alaksandar Milinkievič, as well as the Presidents of the Conference of Rectors of Polish Universities and the Conference of Rectors of Academic Schools in Poland, solemnly signed an \"Letter of Intent\", laying the foundation for the establishment of the program. The event took place in the Adam Mickiewicz Auditorium at the University of Warsaw in the presence of hundreds of students, academics, and guests.\n\nIn light of the recent events in Belarus, particularly the repression targeting young people involved in upholding human rights and democracy, and remembering the not-so-distant times when Poles also had to fight for democracy and freedom, the Polish government and the Conference of Rectors of Academic Schools in Poland declare their intention to establish the \"Konstanty Kalinowski Scholarship Program\". The program aims to support approximately 300 students from Belarus who have been expelled from universities in Belarus due to their involvement in activities defending democratic values.The program was named after Konstanty Kalinowski, born in 1838, a participant in the January Uprising, a representative of the insurgent government in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, who was hanged by the Russian authorities in Vilnius in 1864. He is renowned for his contribution to the defense of Belarusian identity and culture and is held in high esteem by Belarusians who are conscious of their national heritage.\nThe inauguration of the program took place on 5 July 2006. It commenced with a meeting between the scholarship recipients who arrived in Poland and Prime Minister Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz in the garden of the University of Warsaw Library. This was followed by an academic session at the Auditorium Maximum of the University of Warsaw, attended by the Marshal of the Senate of the Republic of Poland Bogdan Borusewicz, Alaksandar Milinkievič, authorities from the University of Warsaw, rectors of Polish universities, and several hundred Polish and Belarusian students.\n\n\n== Conditions of the scholarship ==\nThe duration of the scholarship depends on the year the student enrolled. For those enrolled in their first year, the scholarship can last up to 5 years. Participants of the Program receive a monthly stipend of 1,240 PLN to cover living expenses and accommodation costs. Universities offer students paid places in dormitories. Additionally, scholarship recipients receive dictionaries, encyclopedias, books on culture and history, as well as a sum of 400 PLN for miscellaneous expenses at the beginning of the preparatory course. During the first year of studies, students are under the care of tutors assigned to them from the junior academic staff. Tutors assist them in adapting during the initial period of their studies.\n\n\n== Preparatory courses and tour ==\nThe participants of the first admission were organized into a three-month preparatory course in Warsaw (July–September 2006), which included an intensive Polish language course (up to 5 hours a day), an English language course, and classes on IT, computers, and Internet usage. Within the framework of the course, the scholars also participated in classes and lectures on the history and culture of Poland, Belarus, Lithuania, Ukraine, and Central and Eastern Europe, as well as contemporary international issues, with an emphasis on European Union-related matters. The preparatory course was also an opportunity for numerous discussions, meetings, and cultural events.\nIn the summer of 2006, the participants also embarked on a three-week tour of Poland, during which they visited 22 cities, including Gniezno, Poznań, Wrocław, Kraków, Lublin, Białystok, Gdańsk, Toruń, Łódź, and Częstochowa. The scholars visited the most important academic centers and places of historical significance to Poles. The tour program included events such as meetings with participants of the 1956 Poznań protests, tours of the Wawel Cathedral and Wawel Castle, visits to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, the Battle of Grunwald site, the Gdańsk Shipyard, and meetings with figures like Anna Walentynowicz. The tour provided an opportunity for the scholars to meet with university officials where they would later commence their studies and to explore the most beautiful places in Poland.\nPreparatory courses for subsequent admissions were reduced to one month (September) of intensive Polish language courses. Tours were not organized for them.\n\n\n== Admissions ==\n\n\n=== First admission ===\nIn July 2006, in the first year of the program's operation, out of 300 available slots, 244 scholarship recipients were ultimately accepted. These individuals were unable to commence or continue their studies in Belarus due to their political views or the opposition activities of their parents. The selection of scholarship recipients was based on recommendations issued by a Belarusian unregistered organization called the Social Committee for the Defense of the Repressed \"Solidarity\", led by Ina Kulej. Knowledge of the Polish language was not required. The allocation of program participants to specific universities in Poland was carried out by the Program Office at the Centre for East European Studies of the University of Warsaw, based on applications submitted by universities, taking into account primarily the possibility of continuing studies initiated in Belarus and, to the extent possible, the expectations of the scholarship recipients. The universities independently assessed program differences and established rules for their harmonization. Program participants began their studies in 15 cities across Poland, at 37 universities, on 77 different fields of study. The highest number of individuals commenced their studies in Warsaw (102), followed by Białystok (30), Wrocław (21), Kraków (16), Gdańsk (14), Pułtusk (10), Biała Podlaska (10), Poznań (9), Lublin (8), Katowice (7), Łódź (6), Toruń (5), Bydgoszcz (2), Legnica (1), and Szczecin (1). Among the universities, the largest group of scholarship recipients (58) was enrolled at the University of Warsaw, across 21 different institutes.\nThe scholarship recipients most commonly pursued studies in the following fields: computer science, law, management, political science, and international relations. Individual students enrolled in diverse fields such as European studies, molecular biology, Scandinavian studies, philology, civil engineering, and so on.\nThe scholarship recipients were provided with the opportunity to purchase books necessary for their studies in their respective fields, up to the amount of 500 PLN.\n\n\n=== Second and subsequent admissions ===\n\nIn September 2007, in the second year of the program's operation, the number of admitted students was significantly lower for two reasons. Firstly, learning from the mistakes of the previous year, stricter recruitment criteria were introduced. Secondly, the number of individuals expelled from studies in 2007 decreased. According to Ina Kulej, the chairwoman of the Committee for the Defense of the Repressed \"Solidarity\", the Belarusian authorities realized the inefficiency of continuing such forms of repression. The recruitment process began on 21 June 2007, conducted by a seven-member commission at the headquarters of the BNF Party in Minsk. On 29 August 2007, the list of 63 new Kalinowski Program scholarship holders was approved, including 44 students expelled from Belarusian universities for political reasons and the remaining 19 individuals who suffered for their political beliefs in other ways – activists of the BNF Party, former students of the only Belarusian-language Jakub Kolas High School in Minsk closed by the authorities, and family members of repressed individuals. In the following days, the list was supplemented with several additional individuals, reaching a final total of 71 scholarship holders. They were directed to 15 cities, attending 23 universities, where they pursued studies in 24 fields of study.\nIn September 2008, in the third year of the program's operation, 58 individuals were admitted, who were directed to 11 cities, attending 22 universities, where they pursued studies in 26 fields of study (according to other sources, it was 70 individuals).\nIn September 2009, in the fourth year of the program's operation, 44 individuals were admitted, who were directed to 14 cities, attending 22 universities, where they pursued studies in 26 fields of study.\nIn September 2010, in the fifth year of the program's operation, 53 individuals were admitted. Ten of them met the program's criteria but had not reached the age of 18. These scholarship holders were directed to a one-year preparatory course. The remaining 43 individuals were directed to study in 11 cities, attending 17 universities, where they pursued studies in 26 different fields of study.\nIn December 2010, a total of approximately 250 students were enrolled in the program.\nAfter the wave of repression following the 2010 Belarusian presidential election, the program's management decided to organize an additional, special recruitment. Candidates participated in Preparatory Courses of Polish Language and Culture from February to September 2011, after which they were directed to Polish universities.\nFrom 2006 to 2015, a total of 988 scholarship holders were admitted to the program, who pursued studies at 76 universities. During this period, 332 scholarship holders graduated from Polish universities.\n\n\n== Organizational issues ==\n\n\n=== Allocation ===\nIn September 2006, during the allocation of scholarship recipients to universities, it turned out that the majority of them were not satisfied with their placements because almost everyone wanted to study in Warsaw. However, this was not feasible for various technical reasons. The scholarship holders also protested against what they perceived as poor living and teaching conditions, despite the fact that they were provided with conditions significantly better than those for Polish students. A wave of complaints temporarily paralyzed the work of the relatively small program office. Soon, there were reports of unfamiliar people wandering around student residences inhabited by program participants. These individuals incited the scholarship holders against the program management and encouraged protests regarding the allocations.\nThanks to the flexibility of Warsaw universities, and primarily thanks to the assistance of the authorities of the University of Warsaw, it was possible to fulfill a significant portion of the scholarship holders' demands regarding allocation to Warsaw.\n\n\n=== Scholarship recipients' absences ===\nIn December 2006, it turned out that a significant portion of the scholarship holders, for unknown reasons, had numerous absences from classes or did not commence their studies at all. Some of them resigned from the program without informing the office and went abroad or returned to Belarus. Absences were reported across universities throughout Poland. On 21 December 2006, a mandatory meeting of scholarship holders was organized in Jachranka near Warsaw, attended by only 80 out of 244 students. These absences were later attributed to the departure of the scholarship holders to their homes for the New Year. According to Siarhei, one of the scholarship holders, the reason for this phenomenon was as follows:\n\nIt was visible during the summer while learning Polish – who wants to learn and who doesn't. Just because someone was in the square or has connections with the democratic movement doesn't mean they definitely want to and will learn.\nTo determine the true extent of the problem, from January 17 to February 6, 2007, the program director ordered an \"Internal Control of the Implementation Status of the Konstanty Kalinowski Scholarship Program\". 23 committees were formed, which visited all universities where program participants were studying. During the inspection, representatives of university authorities, tutors, and scholarship holders were met. The inspection revealed that 205 out of 244 students had commenced their studies, attended classes, and did not violate the \"Rules of Program Usage\". Clarification actions were taken against 32 individuals, and six additional individuals were proposed for removal from the list of scholarship holders due to non-commencement of studies despite being directed to do so. A second internal inspection took place in late April and May 2007 to address the problems identified during the first inspection.\nIn June 2009, Ina Kulej, chairperson of the Committee for the Defense of the Repressed \"Solidarity\", admitted that one in five participants had resigned from the program. She cited the main reasons as: lack of the opportunity to study part-time, separation from family and friends, differences in Polish culture and living conditions, and differences in the education system, which in Poland is focused on independent learning. She also expressed a willingness to assist those who had left the program but wished to return.\n\n\n=== Misconduct of scholarship recipients ===\nDue to irregularities in the recruitment process for the first year, a certain number of individuals who had little actual connection to the Belarusian democratic movement ended up on the list of scholarship holders, and their behavior often did not correspond with the seriousness of the Kalinowski Program. Their inappropriate behavior was a serious organizational and reputational problem, especially since all program troubles were observed and widely commented on by official Belarusian media.\nPolish representatives from universities, administrations, and NGOs, who participated in official meetings with the scholarship holders, emphasized in their comments their surprise that many students did not speak the Belarusian language and had no knowledge of the history and politics of their country. They also pointed out the indecent way some girls dressed.\nIn the first days after arriving in Warsaw, several scholarship holders, while intoxicated, got into fights with Polish residents of the student dormitory. Shortly afterward, other scholarship holders identified a boy in their group who, during recruitment, sold fake certificates of participation in the Jeans Revolution in October Square in Minsk for $30.\nA specific problem was the violation of regulations by Vitaut Milinkievič, the son of Alaksandar Milinkievič. Vitaut was listed as a \"child of a repressed person\" among the scholarship holders. On 21 August 2006, while the program participants were on a tour around the country, independent media reported that Vitaut consistently got drunk, acted like a hooligan, and caused problems from the beginning of his stay in Poland. It was also reported that he was removed from the program for his behavior, which was noticed and subsequently publicized by Belarusian state television two days later. The next day, Alaksandar Milinkievič called this information \"untrue\", and his press secretary, Pawel Mazheika, explained that Vitaut did indeed break the rules – he overslept mandatory sightseeing during the tour. However, he was not removed from the program but rather had his tour interrupted and was deprived of the right to stay in the student dormitory and participate in Polish and English language classes. However, he still received the scholarship and prepared independently for university enrollment. This version was also confirmed by Vitaut himself.\nThe issue of Vitaut Milinkievič put the management of the Kalinowski Program in a particularly difficult situation. The question arose as to how severely the direct initiator's son should be punished. Ina Kulej stated that she accepts criticism from Polish partners as objective, while Alaksandar Milinkievič admitted that:\n\nAll program participants must be on equal terms. It should be like that, regardless of who is whose relative.\nThe topic of inappropriate behavior of scholarship holders met with various comments from Belarusian democratic circles. Ina Kulej assessed that the main reason for the problems was cultural differences between Poles and Belarusians. Anton Tsyalezhnikau from the Movement for Democracy in Belarus stated that such problems should be resolved within the program and should not reach the media, as they provide fodder for Belarusian government propaganda. Uladzimir Mitniewicz from bel.ini assessed that rebellious and defiant behavior is an understandable, and even desirable trait among individuals who have fought against the authorities and who are expected to lead revolutions in the future.\n\n\n=== Return of graduates to Belarus ===\nSince the beginning of the program, doubts have arisen about whether scholarship holders will want to return to Belarus after completing their education and whether they will have the opportunity to do so. Both official state media and some opposition circles have referred to the Kalinowski Program as \"brain drain\". A prolonged stay in Poland may prompt some students to settle permanently. Ina Kulej believes that some of the individuals applying for the scholarship did not plan to return to Belarus from the start:\n\nThere is a group of people who want to leave Belarus regardless of the political situation. Another group consists of individuals who, if they had not had the opportunity to leave, would not have completed higher education. The attitudes towards applying for a scholarship among these two groups differ. Those who were forced to leave dream of returning, while those who intended to leave the country from the start seek various ways to stay abroad – to get married, find a job, or pursue further studies.\nSimultaneously, there is concern about the recognition of Polish university diplomas in Belarus. The Belarusian state does not recognize program scholarship holders as students. Jauhien Skrabutan, a program graduate, has so far been unable to obtain official recognition of his diploma from the University of Warsaw. Moreover, some students have pursued studies in fields useful in Poland but not in their own country (e.g., European integration, Polish law). This means that program graduates have much better chances of finding good jobs in Poland than in Belarus. Additionally, since Belarus officially does not acknowledge that scholarship holders are studying, a significant portion of male students is sought after for evading military service. Wiktoria Chakimawa, a scholarship holder from the first admission, believes that many students find good jobs in Poland and decide to stay permanently:\n\nI understand them perfectly. There are more opportunities here; there is no need to be afraid and stay silent. I like Poland, but Belarus is my country, and it has wonderful people. I don't know how it will turn out, but I would really like to return.\nIn January 2010, Ina Kulej revealed that by that time, 8 participants of the Kalinowski Program had completed their studies – 5 girls and 3 boys:\n\nEugeniusz Gawin – remained in Poland, continuing his education in doctoral studies;\nWenedykt Klauze – stayed in Poland because he would be arrested if he returned;\nJauhien Skrabutan – completed his studies at the Department of Belarusian Studies at the Faculty of Applied Linguistics at the University of Warsaw. He returned to Belarus, to Grodno, where he applied for a job at the Grodno Regional Executive Committee's Department of Education. He was referred to the Ministry of Education regarding the recognition of his diploma. He then went to his parents in Zelva and also applied for a job at the Education Department of the District Executive Committee. Initially, he was told that there was a shortage of teachers, but after two days, he received a response stating that there were no vacancies. The scholarship holder remained unemployed, and his diploma was not recognized;\n5 girls – returned to Belarus and found employment in private enterprises.\n\n\n=== Death of Kanstancin Zhilinsky ===\n\nIn mid-May 2010, the body of Kanstancin Zhilinsky, a scholarship recipient from the first admission and a student of the Faculty of Economics at the University of Gdańsk, was found in a student dormitory in Gdańsk. His roommate discovered the body in the morning hours. Initially, suicide was considered the most probable cause of death, supported by the fact that on the day of the tragedy, the student deleted all his accounts from social media websites. However, over time, this hypothesis was questioned. According to the student's mother, during the investigation, the probability of suicide was estimated to be 40%. Initial reports in the press claiming that the student hanged himself were later refuted. Several days before his death, Zhilinsky paid for his health insurance, indicating that he did not plan to take his own life at that time. Other scholarship recipients and neighbors from the student dormitory also disagreed with the suicide hypothesis. Zhilinsky was buried in his hometown of Rahachow.\n\n\n=== Scholarship delays ===\nIt is not uncommon for students studying in Poland under the Kalinowski Program to complain about delays in scholarship payments, sometimes lasting one or even two months, which consequently leads to problems with paying for dormitory accommodation.\n\n\n== Activities of Belarusian security services ==\nAccording to representatives of Belarusian democratic circles and independent media, the Kalinowski Program significantly weakened one of the main tools of repression by the Belarusian authorities against politically active youth – the threat of expulsion from universities. Consequently, since its inception, the program has been the target of attacks from Belarusian state media, as well as numerous provocations and attempts at discrediting by Belarusian special services.\n\n\n=== Attempt to discredit ===\nOn 2 December 2006, an anonymous email in Russian was received at one of the email addresses of the Warsaw office of the program. It was sent from a Russian server and contained instructions in seven points, including instructions to discredit the director of the program, Jan Malicki. It included initials, codenames, and a sum of money in dollars for completing the task. The names given in the email were the actual names of Kalinowski Program scholarship holders. A fragment of the letter, translated into Polish with the names of the scholarship holders replaced by initials, was made public:\n\nTake a prostitute who will engage in sexual intercourse with Malicki and collect compromising material. Responsible – R .; Withdraw the scholarship from V. Responsible – A.\nBoth the author and the purpose of writing the email remained unknown. According to one hypothesis, the message reached the program office by mistake. However, it is more likely that it was a provocation aimed at compromising the scholarship holders by casting suspicion on them for cooperating with the State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus. Information about the email was forwarded, among others, to the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Internal Security Agency also dealt with it.\nDirector Malicki had been receiving insulting text messages for some time.\n\n\n=== Uladzislau \"Vector\" Mikhailau ===\n\nOn 22 January 2007, an interview with one of the scholarship holders of the program, Uladzislau Mikhailau, was published in Tygodnik Powszechny. The 20-year-old student of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering at the Warsaw University of Technology revealed that in early 2006, he was recruited by the State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus as an informant under the codename \"Vector\" through blackmail. He detailed the recruitment process and his subsequent contacts with the security service – he reported on his colleagues in Gomel, and then continued cooperation in Poland by providing information about the recruitment process and the operation of the Kalinowski Program. He emphasized that he wanted to break off cooperation, and he felt safe in Poland, which allowed him to reveal this secret and thus relieve his conscience.\nThe declaration caused a stir among the scholarship holders and people associated with the program, as well as a wave of comments in the media. Some of the scholarship holders saw him as a provocateur, while others saw him as a victim of the system. According to Jauhien Skrabutan, one of the scholarship holders, Mikhailau's disclosure was a State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus' provocation aimed at destabilizing the program. Another scholarship holder, Dzianis Vasilkou, believed that Mikhailau should be helped. Controversies arose regarding the further fate of the student. On one hand, it was argued that a former State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus agent had no right to benefit from the scholarship for repressed opposition members. On the other hand, Mikhailau's courage was emphasized, and it was noted that there may be other people among the students forced to cooperate with the State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus. If Mikhailau were to be removed from the program, it would be a precedent for them that it is not worth revealing the truth. There were also voices that Mikhailau should first seek help from the program management rather than giving an interview to the newspaper, suggesting that his only motivation was an unhealthy desire for fame.\nAfter careful consideration, the program authorities decided to leave Uladzislau Mikhailau on the list of scholarship holders and to provide him with support, including a psychologist. At that time, the scholarship holder became the focus of Polish and Belarusian media attention. On March 10, Mariusz Maszkiewicz, a former Polish ambassador to Belarus and advisor to the prime minister for Eastern affairs, visited him. The student said at that time that he had to leave Poland because he was in danger there. Maszkiewicz assessed that Mikhailau was suffering from mental problems, probably severe depression or psychosis, or possibly under the influence of pharmacological substances. The student repeatedly complained that he was being followed and harassed by the State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus, and later he also spoke about the Polish and American secret services. Aleksei Dzikavitski, a journalist working in Poland for Radio Liberty, confirmed the fact of surveillance – he arranged to meet with Mikhailau for an interview, but unknown men appeared at their meeting and began to aggressively film them. The last time Mikhailau's colleagues saw him in Poland was on March 17, on his 21st birthday. He announced at that time his imminent escape from the country by the ambassador's car. Probably shortly after that, he left for Belarus with the help of the Belarusian embassy. On March 23, shortly after returning to Belarus, state television conducted a lengthy interview with him, during which Mikhailau told a series of lies about the program, living conditions, and education of the scholarship holders in Poland, as well as about alleged coercion to participate in \"anti-Belarusian actions\". He claimed, among other things, that students had to participate in demonstrations in front of the Belarusian embassy to earn their scholarship.\nThis event caused a scandal and a wave of comments in both Polish and Belarusian media. Mikhailau's statements were openly contradicted by his previous entries on his private blog, which were highly critical of Belarusian television, for example, from 10 December 2006.\n\nThe Belarusian State Television named after A. G. Lukashenko announces that all of us, students of the program, have been abandoned!! We have nothing to eat and live in bug-infested places. No comments. Leave Zimouski (the head of Belarusian television) with the penultimate bullet.\nMikhailau's allegations were also denied by other scholarship holders. Katsiaryna Tamkovich said she did not work off any money and attended demonstrations because of her own beliefs.\nIn one of the interviews given after revealing himself but before leaving for Belarus, Mikhailau stated that \"it is visible\" that among the scholarship holders of the Kalinowski Program, there are also other informants of the State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus.\n\n\n=== Repression of scholarship recipients and their families ===\n23 December 2006, at 6:30 P.M. at the railway station in Grodno, Belarusian border guards detained Dzmitry Malchyk. The scholarship holder was returning from Kraków to his home for New Year's. According to his father, Siarhei Malchyk, the boy was questioned by law enforcement officers in civilian clothes. His laptop was also confiscated. The student was held for 5 hours at the customs office, after which he was released on the condition of appearing at the office at a later date.\nOn the same day, at 10:00 P.M. at the Polish-Belarusian Kuźnica–Bruzgi border checkpoint, Jauhien Skrabutan, a scholarship holder from the University of Warsaw, and Maryia Svyantsitskaya, a scholarship holder from Katowice, were detained. The students were returning from Poland home for New Year's. Two hours after the detention, they were subjected to a personal search. Skrabutan's flash cards from the computer were confiscated, with the explanation that they needed to be checked. The scholarship holders were detained at the border by Belarusian border guards until 5:30 A.M. the next day. According to Skrabutan, in the previous days, two more participants of the Kalinowski Program were subjected to searches, including Alexander Kopac from Masty.\nOn 10 April 2007, Volha Dzimіtruk, who went to Belarus to meet her family for Easter, was forcibly pulled into an unmarked car by State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus officers in civilian clothes in the center of Gomel. Later, in an interview with the BiełaPAN agency, she reported that she was pressured to provide information about other scholarship holders, threatened, and coerced into cooperating with the State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus. Two days later, Tatsiana Dzimіtruk, Volha's mother, was visited by a man claiming to be a journalist from Belarus Today and asked about her daughter. Soon after, she began to have problems at work.\nIn early 2007, Jauhien Skrabutan was arrested by the Belarusian militia at the station next to the customs control exit. The scholarship holder was accused of cursing and sentenced to 5 days in prison. According to him, the Belarusian authorities had a full list of participants in the Kalinowski Program, and border guards were catching those on the list. He also stated that he was not the only one who fell victim to such harassment, but most scholarship holders do not want to talk about it.\nIn the summer of 2007, three days after returning home to Zhabinka for vacation after the first year of studies in Poland, Viktoryia Khakimava was summoned for questioning by the State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus, where she was questioned about the Kalinowski Program. According to her, about half of all Belarusians studying in Poland after the first year are interrogated by the State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus, regardless of their political views.\nIn August 2007, Raman Uscinou, during his summer vacation at home in Svyetlahorsk, was summoned for questioning by the State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus. He refused to appear without an official written summons.\nOn 23 August 2009, Belarusian border guards at the Kuźnica–Bruzgi border checkpoint did not allow Nadzeya Krapivina to leave the country. The scholarship holder was detained on her way to Warsaw, where she was soon to begin preparatory courses for her studies. The reasons for the ban were not explained, and she was only informed that she was in the computer database of persons prohibited from leaving the Republic of Belarus.\nIn December 2009, Artsiom Lastavetski returned from Poznań to his hometown of Baranavichy for New Year's. An hour after his return, he received a phone call summoning him to perform military service. The summons was unexpected because he had previously received a deferment until 2011 on the condition of providing proof of enrollment. Lastavetski suspected that the summons had political reasons and aimed to prevent him from continuing his studies in Poland.\nOn 19 December 2010, during the presidential elections, Aleksei Koutun, a scholarship holder from the first admission, was removed from a train traveling from Brest to Minsk by the militia and transported to the Bereza District Department of Internal Affairs. On the same day, during the elections, Ivan Shyla, a scholarship holder from Salihorsk, and his friend Pavel Batuyeu were forced by civilians to stay in Batuyeu's apartment; meanwhile, Anatol Michnavets, a scholarship holder from the first admission, was sought at his apartment by the authorities.\nOn 19 December 2010, many scholarship holders of the Kalinowski Program took part in a demonstration in Minsk against the falsification of the 2010 Belarusian presidential election. Before midnight, during the brutal pacification of the demonstration by the militia and the army, some of them were arrested. Raman Shcherbau, a scholarship holder from the first admission, was arrested and sentenced to several days of detention, which he served in a prison in Minsk at Akrestsina Street. Sviatlana Pankavets, a scholarship holder from the second admission, participated in the demonstration with her mother, Iryna Pankavets. Both were arrested and sentenced to 10 days of detention, which they served in isolation cells on 20 Skaryna Street in Minsk. Andrei Kastusiou, the son of presidential candidate Ryhor Kastusioŭ and a scholarship holder from the first admission, was arrested.\nOn 28 March 2011, at the Bobrowniki-Brzostowica border checkpoint, Belarusian border guards detained Aleh Kotski, a student at the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń. His passport and laptop were confiscated, and his personal belongings and car, which he was traveling in, were searched. The student was not given an explanation for the detention.\n\n\n== Social, political and cultural activities of scholarship recipients ==\n\nThe activity of the Kalinowski Program scholarship recipients for democracy and human rights in Belarus, conducted in the conditions of emigration from Polish territory, is hindered due to the significant dispersion of students across the country. It most often takes the form of individual initiatives undertaken by individual students or by groups gathered in various cities or at universities. Among the most noteworthy initiatives undertaken by the scholarship recipients are:\n\nThe book Kastuś's Diary authored by scholarship recipient Ludmila Asipenka and international relations student Katarzyna Kwiatkowska; between February and July 2007, they conducted interviews with 67 program participants, from which they selected and elaborated on 12 stories of 14 scholarship recipients; the book contains Polish and Belarusian language versions; it was published on 9 February 2008, with a print run of 1000 copies.\nThe establishment of the \"Belarusian National Memory\" association (Belarusian: Беларуская Нацыянальная Памяць), which is engaged in gathering and disseminating knowledge about Belarus, the history of the nation and its cultural heritage, commemorating national heroes and activists, searching for and organizing memorial sites.\nThe involvement of scholarship recipients, including Victoria Chakimawa, in the preparation of the \"Solidarity with Belarus 2010\" concert organized by The Free Belarus Initiative (the concert did not take place due to the Smolensk air disaster).\nThe artistic initiative street-arty.by, involving Polish and Belarusian artists in creating a mural on 22 11 Listopada Street in Warsaw; the idea was conceived by scholar Eugeniusz Gawin, who is also a member of the artistic group Ciąg Dalszy Nastąpi.\nThe scholarship recipients assisted independent Belarusian media, organized Belarusian evenings at their universities, formed musical bands, staged theatrical performances, and more. Some work as correspondents and technicians for Belsat TV and European Radio for Belarus – two media projects aimed at providing independent information to Belarus.\n\n\n=== Białystok incident ===\nOn 23 February 2008, during the Belarusian Song Festival in Białystok, an incident occurred involving participants of the Kalinowski Program. The event was organized by the Belarusian Social and Cultural Society, which is considered to be sympathetic to the authorities in Belarus. During the performances, two scholarship recipients hung the white-red-white flag of Belarus, used by the opposition and prohibited by the Belarusian authorities, between the stage and the audience. Shortly thereafter, they were forcefully removed from the venue by security. This event sparked a wave of outrage among the Belarusian community residing in Poland, as it was interpreted as a form of political persecution. On February 28, an open letter to Prime Minister Donald Tusk was published, requesting action to protect the white-red-white flag from desecration in Poland. It was signed by Eugeniusz Wappa (Chairman of the Belarusian Union in the Republic of Poland), Oleg Łatyszonek (Chairman of the Belarusian Historical Society), and Radosław Dąbrowski (Chairman of the Belarusian Student Association).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nMaszkiewicz, Mariusz, ed.

        "content": "\"See That Girl\" is a song by English singer-songwriter Kirsty MacColl, released on 18 September 1981 by Polydor as the second single from her debut studio album, Desperate Character. It was written by MacColl and produced by Barry \"Bazza\" Farmer.\nAs the follow-up to MacColl's \"There's a Guy Works Down the Chip Shop Swears He's Elvis\", which reached number 14 in the UK Singles Chart in July 1981, \"See That Girl\" failed to make an appearance in the UK charts. It did, however, gain radio airplay and reached number 45 on Record Business magazine's Airplay Guide Top 100 chart in October 1981.\nOn 20 October 1981, MacColl performed the song on the ITV children's series Get It Together.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nUpon its release as a single, Sunie of Record Mirror considered \"See That Girl\" to be \"a marked improvement on the hideous novelty\" of \"There's a Guy Down the Chip Shop Swears He Elvis\" and \"more in the vein\" of MacColl's 1979 single \"They Don't Know\". She added, \"In other words, this is one of Kirsty's rather precious Sixties-style girlie songs, very much the sort of thing Sandie Shaw used to warble.\" She described MacColl's vocal as \"aiming towards a Marianna circa 'As Tears Go By'.\" Peter Trollope of the Liverpool Echo described it as \"another strong single which should follow 'Elvis' into the charts.\" Ian Birch of Smash Hits was negative in his review, stating, \"The song recalls one of those rush jobs that appeared on countless B-sides during the '60s. Even Kirsty sounds bored and she wrote the song.\" He felt MacColl should have \"stayed in the wings until something as snappy as 'Chip Shop' presented itself\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n7-inch single\n\n\"See That Girl\" - 3:01\n\"Over You\" - 2:42\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

On April 4, ten days after her disappearance, authorities arrested two people in connection with her disappearance, who confessed to hitting and killing Ilić with their car.\nUpon her disappearance, Serbia issued the first Amber alert message in the country's history.\n\n\n== Background ==\nDanka Ilić was autistic.\n\n\n== Disappearance ==\nOn March 26, Ilić and her mother, Ivana, were on a walk in Banjsko Polje. Around 1:45 pm local time, Ivana lost track of her daughter.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nInitial investigations in Banjsko Polje found no leads. Interpol became involved with the search for Ilić, and issued a yellow warrant in her case by April 1.\nSome investigatiors suggested Ilić may have been taken out of the country. Viennese police investigated a video recorded in Vienna, Austria, alleged to be of Ilić, but concluded that there was no connection to the case.\nOn the morning of April 4, police found blood on a utility vehicle. They proceeded to arrest two people connected to the car in connection with Ilić's disappearance and death. Police reported that the two confessed to killing Ilić, and that they would lead police to where Ilić's body had been left. According to authorities, shortly after Ilić had been separated from her mother, she was hit by a car, killing her. The two drivers then transported her body to a landfill.\n\n\n== References ==",

He became principal of Allendale High School before attending Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, then resumed teaching in Bamberg.  Hartzog began publishing a newspaper, the Bamberg Herald, in 1891.  In 1895, he became superintendent of the Johnston Institute in Edgefield County.\n\n\n== Clemson ==\nAfter the sudden resignation of Edwin Boone Craighead, the trustees of Clemson College began a search for a new president.  Clemson trustee and U. S. Senator Benjamin Tillman lived only 5 miles (8.0 km) from Johnston, and was interested in Hartzog's background in agriculture, military, engineering, as well as his experience in South Carolina's secondary schools.  Hartzog was offered and accepted the job in September 1897.\nHartzog's first order of business was to improve the sanitary conditions on campus, after an outbreak of typhoid and malaria the previous summer.  Improvements were made to the drinking water supply and campus dairy, and Hartzog changed the academic calendar to move the long break from winter to summer.  In the fall of 1898 Clemson opened the first textile school in the South, tapping into a growing industry in upstate South Carolina.\nEnrollment continued to rise, from 337 students in 1897 to 483 by 1901, with Hartzog reporting to the trustees that 300 further applicants were rejected for lack of space.  Trustees authorized the construction of a new dormitory, and expansions of the chemistry and mechanical engineering buildings.  In 1900, engineering professor (and future university president) Walter Riggs, who had coached Clemson's first football team convinced Hartzog to allow the formation of an athletic booster club.  The club's funds were used to hire the school's first professional coach, John Heisman.\n\n\n=== Cadet walkout ===\nIn early 1902, a sophomore cadet was charged with taking a test tube from the chemistry lab's supply closet to his work station without the permission of professor Richard Brackett.  The faculty voted to suspend the cadet (though notably Brackett and fellow chemistry professor Mark Hardin voted against the suspension), and upheld the suspension after a petition from his classmates to reconsider the decision.  The students asked Hartzog to take their case to trustee president Richard Simpson in nearby Pendleton, but Hartzog refused.  The following day, sixty-nine of the seventy-four sophomores left campus in protest, with the other classes preparing to leave as well.  Simpson and the trustees agreed to hear the case, reversing the cadet's suspension and declining to punish the students who walked out.  Having lost the trust of the students and his faith in the trustees, Hartzog resigned from Clemson in June 1902.\n\n\n== Arkansas ==\nHartzog became president of the University of Arkansas in 1902.  During his tenure, he secured funding for seven new buildings and increased enrollment.  In 1905 Governor Jeff Davis replaced Hartzog with his hand-picked candidate, John N. Tillman, in an effort to broaden his power before a run for the United States Senate.\n\n\n== Ouachita Baptist ==\nHartzog served as president of Ouachita Baptist College from 1907 until 1911.\n\n\n== Post-presidency ==\nAfter leaving Ouachita Baptist, Hartzog published textbooks and grade school workbooks.  He died on December 15, 1953, in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Charles Saltonstall (fl. 1642) was an English sea captain.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWhiddon was probably son of Sir Samuel Saltonstall (d. 1640), and brother of Wye Saltonstall, who dedicated to him his ‘Picturæ Loquentes’ in 1631. Charles was the author of ‘The Navigator, shewing and explaining all the Chiefe Principles and Parts both Theorick and Practick that are contained in the famous Art of Navigation …’ (sm. 4to, 1642). The work is extremely rare, and in the British Museum there was only an imperfect copy of the third edition (sm. 4to, 1660?). In the dedication to Thomas, earl of Arundel and Surrey, he describes himself as a stranger to the land and his kinsfolk, many long voyages having banished him from the remembrance of both; and in the body of the work he speaks incidentally of having sailed with the Hollanders. As a treatise on navigation, the little book has considerable merit; it strongly condemns the ‘plaine charts’ then in use; urges the use of the so-called Mercator's charts, the invention of which he correctly attributes to Edward Wright, and discusses at some length the principle of great circle-sailing. He may be identical with the Charles Saltonstall who in 1640–1 wrote from Boston in Lincolnshire, condemning the inefficiency of Sir Anthony Thomas in connection with the draining of the fens and the works on the north-east side of the river Witham (Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1640, p. 102, 1 Feb. 1640–1), or with the Captain Charles Saltonstall who in January 1652 commanded the ship John in the state's service (ib. 6 Jan. 1652). A portrait of Saltonstall, engraved by William Marshall, is prefixed to the ‘Art of Navigation.’\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1897). \"Saltonstall, Charles\".

In 1588 he commanded Ralegh's ship the Roebuck, in the fleet under Lord Howard, and is described as particularly active in the various services which could be performed by so small a vessel. He took possession of, and brought into Torbay, the flagship of Don Pedro de Valdes; he brought supplies of ammunition to the fleet, and was constantly employed in scouting duty. In 1594 he was sent out by Ralegh to make a preliminary exploration of the Orinoco. His object was frustrated by the governor of Trinidad, who imprisoned some of his crew, and practically obliged him to return to England without the information he sought. It is probable that he was with Ralegh in the voyage to Guiana in 1595, the expedition against Cadiz in 1596, and the Islands' voyage in 1597; but his name is not mentioned.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1900). \"Whiddon, Jacob\".

        "content": "Peter Carder (fl. 1577–1586) was a British mariner.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nCarder of St. Veriun in Cornwall, who, according to his own story, a seaman of the Pelican with Drake when she sailed from England on her voyage round the world in November 1677. In October 1578, the ship being then in the Straits of Magellan, Carder was one of eight men in the pinnace who in a gale lont sight of the ship, and, not being able to sight her again, made the mainland and followed alone the shore to St. Julian, living on shellfish and such fish as they could catch. From St. Julian tbey made to the river Plata, and crossing to the north side wandered into the woods, leaving two men in the boat. They fell in with the natives, who attacked them, captured four of the party, and chased the others to the boat, in which they managed to escape, though all badly wounded. They got to an island some three leagues distant from the shore, where two of the wounded men died, Carder and another William Pitcher, by name, being left the sole survivors. A gale on and smashed their boat on the rocks, and for some two months they supported life on sand eels, little crabs, and a fruit resembling an ornnge, but for want of water they were reduced to the most direful straits. At length some driftwood came ashore, they managed to make a raft, and, provisioning it as best they could, put to sea. It was three days and two nights before they reached the land, when, coming to 'a little river of very sweet and pleasant water,' Pitcher drank to such excess that he died within half an hour. Carder after this met with a tribe of savages who received him as a friend, he stayed with them for some time, learned their language, taught them to make and use shields and clubs — for before they were armed only with bows and arrows — and led them against a neighbouring tribe, which they completely defeated, and took many prisoners, most of whom they roasted and devoured. Afterwards he was permitted to leave this tribe, and made his way northwards to Bahia and Pemambuco, whence after some delay he embarked for Europe ; and so, after some further adventures, he arrived in England in November 1586.\nThe whole story is related at length in 'Purchas, his Pilgrimes,' as though in Carder's own words. The presumption is that it was written by Carder and supplied by him to Samuel Purchas. It is therefore necessary to point out that the very remarkable narrative rests entirely on Carder's own testimony, is not corroborated by any other, and is virtually contradicted by very high authority on the one important point on which contradiction was possible. In the narrative of the Pelican's voyage (The World encompassed by Sir Francis Drake, Hakluyt Soc.), while many trifling things are carefully recorded, there is no mention of the loss of the pinnace with eight men. It is barely possible that the omission is an oversight; it is much more probable that there was no such loss to record, and that, from beginning to end, the story is a fiction. Of the narrator we have no other knowledge. The narrative speaks of him as still alive in 1618, and apparently in 1626, when the 'Pilgrimes' was published.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1887). \"Carder, Peter\".

The Labour Party held a majority on the council until 2003, when the council fell to no overall control. Labour retook the council in 2012, but lost the council in 2016. The Conservatives won their first majority on the council in 2019, and have controlled the council since then. In the previous election, the Conservatives won 7 seats (down 3) with 41.5% of the vote, Labour won 5 (up 1) with 38.1%, independents won 2 (up 2) with 9.6%, and the Liberal Democrats defended their seat up for election with 7.0%.\nThe seats up for election in 2024 were last contested in 2021; because of the delay of all local elections due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the seats are up for election after 3 years rather than the usual 4. In that election, the Conservatives gained 8 seats with 60.3% of the vote, Labour lost 7 with 25.6%, and the Liberal Democrats lost 1 with 5.5%.\n\n\n== Previous council composition ==\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== Ward results ==\nIncumbents are marked with an asterisk (*).\n\n\n=== Croft Baker ===\n\n\n=== East Marsh ===\n\n\n=== Freshney ===\n\n\n=== Haverstoe ===\n\n\n=== Heneage ===\n\n\n=== Humberston and New Waltham ===\n\n\n=== Immingham ===\n\n\n=== Park ===\n\n\n=== Scartho ===\n\n\n=== Sidney Sussex ===\n\n\n=== South ===\n\n\n=== Yarborough ===\n\n\n== References ==",

The next day, 25 March 1924, 283 deputies ratified the \"Resolution on the Deposition of the Dynasty and the Proclamation of the Republic\". («Ψήφισμα περί εκπτώσεως της Δυναστείας και ανακηρύξεως της Δημοκρατίας») \nThe resolution was approved by the Greek people in the referendum of 30 April 1924.\nOn 8 June 1924, Georgios Kondylis, followed by the ministers Georgios Roussos, Aristomenis Mitsotakis and Emmanouil Tsouderos, resigned from the government. \nKondylis cited Papanastasiou's indifference to the action within the army of the pro-communist organization, \"Enosis Paleon Polemiston\"; Tsouderos, because his recommendations on finances were rejected; Roussos was not excused; while Mitsotakis cited authoritarianism on the part of Papanastasiou and his disagreement with the bill \"on exchange controls\".\nPapanastasiou reacted by reshuffling his cabinet, with the tacit support of Andreas Michalakopoulos. However, dissatisfaction was growing, and on 19 July 1924 the government lost Parliament's confidence  and Papanastasiou resigned.\n\n\n== Council of Ministers ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Harry Paulet (died 1804) was a British master-mariner.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPaulet is said to have been the master of a small vessel trading to North America; to have been captured by the enemy in 1758, and taken to Quebec; and, being known as a good pilot for the St. Lawrence, to have been sent a prisoner to Europe. The ship in which he sailed put into Vigo, and Paulet, being allowed access to the cabin, laid hold of a packet of despatches, carelessly left within his reach, and dropped overboard. There were two English men-of-war in the river, and Paulet, with the packet of despatches in his mouth, swam to one of these and was taken on board. The despatches proved to be of great value, and Paulet was sent with a copy of them to Lisbon, and thence in a sloop of war to England. In London he was examined by the authorities, and, on the information which he gave and that which was contained in the despatches, the expedition of 1759 was organised, Paulet being rewarded with ‘the pay of a lieutenant for life.’ This annuity of 90l. a year enabled him, it is said, to purchase a vessel, in which he ran cargoes of brandy from the French coast. On one voyage he fell in with the French fleet which had escaped out of Brest ‘while Edward Hawke lay concealed behind the rocks of Ushant.’ Paulet, risking his brandy for the love of his country, ran to find the English fleet, and demanded to speak with the admiral. He was ordered on board the flagship, and, having told his story, was assured by Hawke that if it was true, he would make his fortune; if false, he would hang him at the yard-arm. The fleet then got under way, and Paulet, at his special request, was permitted to stay on board. In the battle which followed he behaved with the utmost gallantry, and was sent home ‘rewarded in such a manner as enabled him to live happily the remainder of his life.’\nSuch is Paulet's own story, which he very probably brought himself, in his old age, to believe. But wherever it can be tested it is false, and no part of it can be accepted as true. If, in the end of 1758, the admiralty had had a first-rate pilot for the St. Lawrence at their disposal, that pilot would have been sent to the St. Lawrence with Saunders; and, if he had been examined either by the admiralty or the secretary of state, there would be some record of the examination; but there is no such record. We may be quite sure that if he had been granted the pay of a lieutenant for life, the amount would be charged somewhere; but it does not appear. Again, when Conflans came out of Brest on 14 November 1759, the English fleet was not ‘concealed behind the rocks of Ushant;’ nor was it ever at anchor there. Hawke learned of the escape of Conflans from the master of a victualler, which, on its way from the squadron in Quiberon Bay, saw the French fleet making for Belle Isle. It is barely possible that Paulet was the victualler and gave the information. In some way or other he certainly made money, and in his old age was generous to the poor of his neighbourhood. He is said to have been an admirable narrator of his own adventures or of Hawke's battle. He died in Lambeth in 1804.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1895). \"Paulet, Harry (d.1804)\".

It was composed during a journey in the United States, while travelling in a car on Interstate 5, and had the working title \"San Diego Freeway\". Ernesto Assante wrote about it: '[it's] difficult to search for verses, refrains, bridges, in a marvellous broken and danceable rhythm in which funky and disco are so sophisticated and elegant as to seem elusive, and the melody evolves in a crescendo that allows Battisti to sing at his best, up to his by then classical falsetto'.\n\n\n== Other versions ==\nBattisti recorded the song in English as \"Baby, It's You\" and in Spanish as \"De nuevo tú\". Artists who covered the song include Mina, Marcella Bella, Paola Turci, Formula 3, Jack Savoretti,  Róisín Murphy, T. Storm Hunter, Cristiano Malgioglio with Maria Schneider, Tiziana Rivale. It was sampled by Sangue Misto in \"Manca Mone\" and by Dargen D'Amico in \"Bere una cosa\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAncora tu at Discogs (list of releases)",

        "content": "Miles Philips (fl. 1587) was an English mariner.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPhilips was with Captain John Hawkyns in his voyage of 1568, and was one of those who, to the number of 114, were put on shore near Panuco, after the disaster at San Juan de Lua. After losing many of their companions in skirmishes with the Indians, they reached Panuco, where the Spanish governor thrust them into a filthy dungeon, and threatened to hang them. They were afterwards sent to Mexico and allotted as servants, each Spaniard who took one being bound to produce him when called on. After several months in Mexico as a domestic servant, Philips was appointed overseer at a silver mine, where in the course of three or four years he accumulated some four thousand pieces of eight. But in 1574 the inquisition was established in Mexico, and, by way of a beginning, the inquisition seized all the English, stripped them of the money they had saved, and charged them with being Lutheran heretics. Philips, with others, was required to say the paternoster, Ave Maria, and the creed in Latin, and was questioned as to his belief concerning the bread and wine after consecration. Many of them were cruelly racked; and after close and solitary imprisonment for upwards of a year and a half, they were brought up for judgment. Three of the party were sentenced to be burnt; several to be severely flogged and to serve in the galleys for six, eight, or ten years. Philips was condemned to serve five years in a monastery, wearing ‘a fool's coat or San Benito’ of yellow cotton with red crosses on it.\nWhen the five years came to an end he was allowed to go free, but not to quit the country. He bound himself for three years to a silk-weaver. Afterwards, on news of Francis Drake having landed at Acapulco, he was sent there as interpreter, with a body of two hundred soldiers. After searching along the coast to Panama, and learning that Drake had certainly departed, they returned to Mexico, and, a month later, Philips succeeded in escaping to Vera Cruz, where he hoped to get on board a ship. He was, however, apprehended, but managed to escape to the woods, where he fell in with some Indians, who guided him to Puerto de Cavallos in Honduras, whence he obtained a passage to Havana. There he entered as a soldier, and was sent to Spain. At San Lucar he was denounced as an Englishman, but he got away to Seville, afterwards entered again as a soldier on board a galley bound to Majorca, and there found an English ship which carried him to England. He landed at Poole in February 1581 – 1582.\nSuch is the outline of the story told by Philips himself to Hakluyt; but beyond the facts that he was put on shore by Hawkyns, that the inquisition was established in Mexico in 1574, and that he returned to England, it is uncorroborated. The outlines of his story may however be true.\nHaving arrived in England in February 1581–2, Philips would seem to have sailed from Southampton with John Drake in the following May. On 29 Jan. 1586–7 he was rescued by Captain Lister of the Clifford near the Earl of Cumberland's watering-place on the River Plate, that is, close to where John Drake was wrecked in 1582. He appears to have returned to England in the Clifford.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1896). \"Philips, Miles\".

        "content": "Revalize, Inc. is an American multinational computer technology company headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, United States. It provides enterprise software and cloud-based applications to manage business operations and streamline manufacturing processes.\nThe company suite of software includes configure price quote (CPQ), computer-aided design (CAD), engineering simulation, product lifecycle management (PLM), data management, product visualization, and analytics.\nAs of 2024, Revalize operates on a global scale with a workforce of over 500 employees.\n\n\n== History ==\nRevalize was founded on June 29, 2021, by TA Associates (\"TA\"), a global growth private equity firm, and ST6, a consortium of software operating executives, with a vision to create a leading provider of sector-specific software and SaaS solutions for the manufacturing industry.\nThe company was established through the strategic acquisition of key technologies: Configure One CPQ and FPX Selling Cloud for sales configuration, PIPE-FLO for fluid flow analysis, and Lighting Analysts for a photometric analysis, together forming the foundation of Revalize's technology portfolio. This foundation was further shaped by Hg Capital through a merger and acquisition operation, which contributed to Revalize's acquisition-driven expansion within the manufacturing software solutions sector.\nRevalize formation was marked by the acquisition of AutoQuotes (\"AQ\"), from Luminate Capital Partners, a technology company specializing in the development of software for the food equipment and supplies (FES) industry. Under the leadership of Jim Contardi, the former CEO of AutoQuotes and Avitru, Revalize set out to amalgamate industry-specific software (ISS).\nIn August 2021, Revalize expanded its portfolio by acquiring four additional companies:\n\nAttainia Holdings, a provider of software for planning, budgeting, forecasting, and tracking healthcare capital assets throughout their lifecycle.\nBCA Technologies, a company specializing in software solutions for the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) sectors.\nLeadMethod, a developer of lead management software designed to improve the sales process for manufacturers and their distributors.\nMicroD, a company offering digital marketing and web design services, as well as eCommerce and product visualization solutions for the home furnishings industry.\nIn October 2021, Revalize expanded into continental Europe with the acquisition of Sofon from Main Capital Partners (“Main”), a Netherlands-based guided selling, and CPQ software.\nIn November 2021, Revalize further expanded its footprint in the manufacturing software industry by acquiring three additional European companies, incorporating five respective brands. The acquisitions included:\n\nPROCAD Group, formerly headquartered in Karlsruhe, Germany, known for its comprehensive product lifecycle management (PLM) and product data management (PDM) solutions, serving over 1,350 customers with more than 250 employees across 12 locations. The group was formed from the merger of PROCAD with Keytech and ACATEC, enhancing Revalize's capabilities in PLM and CPQ solutions for manufacturers.\nSpecPage, previously based in Kussnacht, Switzerland, a developer of innovative PLM and quality assurance solutions tailored for recipe-based, process manufacturers, focusing on the complex aspects of product labeling in global competition for consumer packaged goods (CPG).\nTENADO, acquired from Maxburg Capital Partners and originally located in Bochum, Germany, is a provider of computer-aided design (CAD) software for various sectors including metal and wood fabrication, mechanical engineering, fire protection, and traffic management, with more than 30,000 active users.\nAcross 2022 and 2023, Revalize saw some notable leadership changes; Bryan Klann joined as Chief Revenue Officer, and Ruben Mier, previously at Seismic, took on the role of Senior Vice President of Marketing. Alex Nagyivan from ADP was appointed Vice President of Revenue Operations, and Keith Tice, became Vice President of Corporate Development.\nIn July 2023, Revalize announced Michael Sabin was appointed as CEO, succeeding Jim Contardi, who led Revalize since its formation.\nIn October 2023, Revalize broadened its capabilities in the foodservice equipment and supplies (FES) industry by acquiring Kochman Consultants, Ltd. (KCL), a provider of commercial foodservice design software.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Richard Pike (1834 – 4 May 1893) was a British master-mariner.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPike was born in 1834 at Carboniere in Conception Bay, Newfoundland. He was brought up in the northern fisheries, in whaling and sealing, and in 1869 obtained command of a steamer engaged in that trade. In 1875 he was captain of the Proteus, a stout-built vessel of 467 tons and 110 horse-power, which in 1881 was chartered by the United States government to carry Lieutenant Adolphus Greely and his party through Smith Sound to Lady Franklin Bay. This was safely effected; and, in 1883, the Proteus, still commanded by Pike, was again chartered to carry out relief to the expedition, the United States ship Yantic being ordered to accompany her as a depot, as far as was prudent, but not to venture into the ice, for which she was not fitted. On 23 July, off Cape Sabine, the Proteus was nipped in the pack and sank almost immediately; no lives were lost, but there was scant time to save some provisions and clothes. Sometimes in the boats, sometimes painfully dragging them over the rough ice-floes, Pike and his companions succeeded, after extreme hardship, in reaching Upernavik, where they were taken up by the Yantic. For that year there was no relief to Greely's party; but the survivors were rescued in the following year. In 1891 Pike, in the steamer Kite, was engaged to carry Robert Peary and his party, which he put on shore in McCormick Bay in Murchison Sound (lat. 77 43' N.), and returned without misadventure. In the next year he brought the party back, and was to have taken Peary out again in the summer of 1893. The arrangement was cancelled by Pike's death, at St. John's, on 4 May. 'A typical Newfoundlander,' wrote his shipmates in the Kite, 'as active in mind and body as many men of half his years.' 'A quiet, unassuming man,' wrote a correspondent of the 'Times,' 'thoroughly capable and reliable, unequalled as an Arctic navigator, and in the front rank of our sealing captains.'\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1896). \"Pike, Richard (1834-1893)\".

Poorbaugh Block, a building listed on National Register of Historic Places on January 12, 2024. The first floor was originally constructed for The Quarry Store, serving as a general merchandise business in 1889. Subsequently, the second floor was used by a local family, and later repurposed as office space. From 1917 to 1972, the building functioned as the headquarters for the local newspaper, the Jasper Journal. In 1980, the Jasper Area Historical Society (JAHS) acquired the property, establishing the museum on-site in 1981. The museum is owned and operated by the Jasper Area Historical Society.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Jasper Museum itself opened in 1981. The JAHS initially planned to use the C. O. Christianson House, the first house built in Jasper, as the museum. The Society acquired Bauman Hall in 1978, restoring it before transferring ownership to the city in 1981. The Christianson House proved too small over the years. The Society then purchased the Poorbaugh Building for use as a museum.The historical society had been working towards getting the property listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The initial step involved conducting a National Register evaluation, which was made possible through a grant from the Minnesota Historical Society. Subsequently, another grant was secured in 2021 to support the efforts towards submitting a National Register nomination. The property officially earned its place on the National Register of Historic Places on January 12, 2024.The organization has begun the process of arranging for a historic building conditions assessment. This assessment will inspect the building's materials and features, assessing their condition. The resulting assessment report will aid the historical society in prioritizing areas that require attention, including known issues such as repointing, wall bowing, and resolving water infiltration.\n\n\n== Exhibits ==\nExhibits on domestic life, clothing, and household goods. Artifacts and information about the founding of Jasper, the area's role in Minnesota's history, and the lives of its residents. Displays on the history of farming in the region.\nThe Jasper Museum preserves the history of Jasper and the surrounding area. It offers residents and visitors a chance to learn about the people, places, and events that have shaped the community. The museum is run by volunteers and relies on community support to continue its work.\n\n\n== Jasper Area Historical Society ==\nThe non-profit organization is dedicated to preserving and sharing the history of Jasper, Minnesota and the surrounding area. Founded in 1976, the society plays a vital role in keeping the community's past alive for future generations.\nThe Society's initial objective was to commemorate the bicentennial by restoring the historic C.O. Christianson House in Jasper and converting it into a museum. Despite being relocated to Moody County, South Dakota, the Society successfully brought it back to Jasper, restored it, but found it too small to serve as a museum. In 1980, they acquired the Poorbaugh building to fulfill that purpose.  The volunteer based society relies on membership dues, donations, and an annual fundraiser during Quartzite Days to support its activities.\n\n\n== John M. Poorbaugh Block ==\nThe John M. Poorbaugh Block, constructed and put into service in May of 1889, stands as a significant landmark in the Jasper commercial area. It was one of the pioneering stone buildings in the locality, situated along a two-block stretch of Wall Street. Originally intended to house The Quarry Store on the ground floor, the building evolved to accommodate various uses over the years. From serving as an apartment to later functioning as an office, and eventually housing the local newspaper from 1916 to 1972, the Poorbaugh Block held a pivotal role in the community. Its unique architectural design, incorporating jasper quartzite and red pipestone, set it apart from the surrounding stone structures, showcasing an elevated sense of style and craftsmanship.The construction of the Poorbaugh Block took place on the northeast corner of Wall Street and Sherman Avenue. Situated directly across from the E.A. Sherman block, both structures were being built simultaneously, marking the endpoints of the commercial strip on the east side. Moving east from the Poorbaugh Block, the area quickly transitions to residential properties. Construction on the building's foundation began in the fall of 1888. By February 1, 1889, the necessary stone had been delivered to the site, and by the end of March, a team of stone cutters was hard at work preparing the stone. The local newspaper described the building as being made of \"gray jasper trimmed with the Pipestone red rock.\" George Rehm of Mason City completed the stonework, with pointing carried out by A. Palm, a recent resident of JasperThe front facade of the building showcases intricate design elements that set the Poorbaugh Block apart from other commercial buildings in Jasper. The checkerboard pattern of red pipestone and jasper pink on the cornice, along with the archivolt and parapet trimmed in red pipestone, adds a unique character to the architecture. A red pipestone plaque proudly displays the building name and construction date - \"J.M. Poorbaugh 1889\". The corners of the building feature distinct pinnacles made of jasper and pipestone, adding to the overall detail of the structure.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Carlton County, Minnesota\nList of museums in Minnesota",

She met Sunil Pokharel and Badri Adhikari while she was still at school. They had cast her sister as the lead in their production and they wanted a girl to play her sister. She was cast despite her sister's worries that the job would distract her from her studies.\nShe has had a career of more than thirty years in Nepali theatre and she has appeared in about fifty different productions.\nIn 2010 the South Asian Women's Theatre Festival took place in Delhi and several plays were staged. Sharma played the main character of Nora in a Nepali adaptation of Henry Ibsen's feminist play A Doll's House. The translated play, Putaliko Ghar, had been adapted by Sunil Pokharel from Henry Ibsen's original. The play was seen by Nepali nationals or those with a Nepali heritage. The important theme of the play is that Nora finally gives up on her husband in order that she can have her own life.\nIn 2023 she was chosen as the Chancellor of the Nepal Academy of Music and Drama (NAMUDA). She was promoted from Head of Drama in a move that surprised her. She became NAMUDA's first woman Chancellor. She took the oath of office on 16 February 2024 together with two other chancellors in a ceremony with the Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. She identified the need for the academy to establish an international position and she also planned to create a library of Nepali folk music and plays. The job was important and she set aside other commitments to concentrate on this role for the four years of her term.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Spells and Daubs is a studio album by electronic music group Kreidler. It was released by German record label Bureau B on January 28, 2022 on cd, vinyl, limited double vinyl, and digitally.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nThe album was recorded and produced in Düsseldorf at Kabawil, in Hilden at Uhrwerk Orange and in Berlin at Paulick Saal and 13 Floor Elevator between 2020 and 2021. And mixed by Peter Walsh in London. Three digital singles were released in the run-up to the album: Arise Above on November 5, 2021, Arena on December 17, 2011, and Revery on January 28, 2022, the latter with a video.\n\n\n== Dinked edition ==\nAn alternative edition of 300 of the vinyl album was released in the UK on January 21. It came with an additional 12\" EP with three songs featuring Eric D. Clark as guest vocalist, and alternative artwork.\n\n\n== Artwork ==\nThe album artwork is by Heinz Emigholz. A selection of black-and-white drawings from his series The Basis of Make-Up on cover, inner sleeve and in the cd- booklet.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nBoomkat labeled the album an \"outstanding beatdown slink from Düsseldorf's artful, rhythm-driven minimalists\", and continued \"...they beautifully home in on the rhythmelodic impetus that was morphed in translation from US soul into english synth-pop circa the early ‘80s; juicing its essence into sleek instrumental forms that have been polished to a tip-of-tongue shimmer by Peter Walsh...\" Paul Simpson of Allmusic wrote: \"Kreidler's 12th (or so) studio album is their most concise, focused effort in decades, if not their entire career.\" Truck added \"Legends in their scene, Kreidler fuse intricately produced electronic elements with organic instrumentation, resulting in a driving sound reminiscent of later era Kraftwerk, but with perfectly crafted pop structures.\"\nWhile the fretless bass playing reminded some reviewers of Mick Karn of Japan: \"coolly underlined by the presence of slippery, fretless Mick Karn-style basslines that thread from a Timba-meets-Japan arabesque 'Toys I Never Sell' to the balmy bliss of 'Revery' (Boomkat). \"Revery is a middle of the night waking dreamscape with a slow pulse and sinuous bass textures conjuring up visions of China in the mist.\" (whisperinandhollerin)  \"In the elegant, almost lounge-like successions of \"Unframed Drawings\" peep some glimpses of the seminal technique handed down to posterity by the late Mick Karn and his bass.\" (Ondarock) \"Toys I Never Sell Sell recalls the activities of Jansen, Barbieri and Karn.\" (Artnoir).\nThe album reached in February 2022 place 38 in the Official Record Store Chart.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nCredits adapted from Discogs.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nCredits adapted from Discogs and official album page.\nKreidler\n\nThomas Klein\nAlexander Paulick\nAndreas Reihse\nRecorded at\n\nKabawil Düsseldorf\nPaulick Saal Berlin\nUhrwald Orange Hilden\n13 Floor Elevator Berlin\nTechnical\n\nPeter Walsh, mix, spatial soundscaping and additional production, at e2immersive London\nMike Grinser, mastering and vinyl cut, Manmade Mastering Berlin\nHeinz Emigholz, drawings\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDiscogs\nDinked edition",

        "content": "Apocalypse Clown is a 2023 Irish comedy film. During an electricity outage in Ireland, it follows the depressed clown Bobo (David Earl), the horror movie–style clown Funzo (Natalie Palamides), the circus clown The Great Alphonso (Ivan Kaye), the mime artist Pepe (Fionn Foley) and the clickbait writer Jenny (Amy De Bhrún).\nThe movie was written by the comedy troupe Dead Cat Bounce and directed by George Kane; they previously worked together on the 2012 mockumentary Discoverdale. It was filmed in Dublin, Kildare and County Wicklow across three weeks on a low budget. After winning Best Irish Film at the Galway Film Fleadh, it was released in cinemas on 1 September 2023. Critics praised the casting, particularly of Palamides, but had mixed opinions on the writing and comedy.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nIn Dublin, Bobo tries to perform a clown act to children in a hospital after he has been fired, while two living statues come into conflict with Funzo, a clown who scares away children, and Pepe is lambasted by his idol Jean Ducocque after his mime act. After Ducocque dies, Jenny—a writer at a clickbait publication—is assigned to cover the funeral, after mockery from her office about a one-night stand with Bobo. At the funeral in Naherbawn, Jenny rejects Bobo's advances, a clown called The Great Alphonso announces his comeback television performance, and violence breaks out between the statues and Funzo. The attendees are jailed, but escape when a solar flare causes a widespread power outage.\nTravelling by clown car, Alphonso mocks Bobo's childhood design of a dangerous three-person clown stunt. They reach a hot dog stand and learn about the chaos that has broken out from the outage. The group stay overnight with a commune in the forest until their disastrous clown show is interrupted by the statues' arrival. Alphonso kidnaps Jenny and takes her to a conspiratorial acquaintance, Tim, who claims to have predicted the flare. Jenny wants to use Tim's transmitter and Alphonso's circus tower mast to broadcast a news report. Meanwhile, the other clowns crash their car and trek across a barren wasteland. Low on morale, Funzo describes how she accidentally doused people in lighter fluid as a child. Funzo, Bobo and Pepe agree to stop dressing as clowns and use their real names: Janet, Ken and Dean, respectively. They burn their clothes.\nAlphonso and Jenny arrive at the circus and Alphonso wins over child bullies to work for him. He imprisons Jenny unless she agrees to be his assistant. After recruiting Tim, Janet, Ken and Dean devise a plan to get past the children but are immediately captured when Janet releases a flare too early. Tim reveals that Alphonso drowned his brother in gunge after his brother insulted his show, Alphonso's Fun Club.\nDuring Alphonso's televised performance, Funzo, Bobo and Pepe adopt their clown characters again to perform the stunt Bobo designed as a child. The statues arrive and restrain Alphonso, Funzo attacks, and Bobo and Tim drown Alphonso in a pit of gunge. The clowns set up the transmitter for Jenny's news report, where she begins describing a grand conspiracy involving pedophile lizards selling harvested DNA to China. She is interrupted by electrical power returning. At the burial of Ducocque, after society has returned to normal, Jenny turns down Bobo again and Funzo, Bobo and Pepe agree to form a troupe.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nDavid Earl as Bobo, a former children's entertainer and depressed, homeless alcoholic\nNatalie Palamides as Funzo, a horror movie–style clown with an ambiguous European accent who unintentionally terrifies others with her \"street clown\" performances\nIvan Kaye as The Great Alphonso, an egotistical circus performer and former television clown\nFionn Foley as Pepe, an arrogant, classically trained but untalented mime artist\nAmy De Bhrún as Jenny Malone, a reporter with ambition beyond the clickbait outlet she works at\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was written by members of the comedy troupe Dead Cat Bounce: Demian Fox, Shane O'Brien and James Walmsley. George Kane, whose previous work was in British television comedy, was the director and a co-writer. Dead Cat Bounce formed in Trinity College Dublin and had previously performed as a band. In 2012 they released a mockumentary, Discoverdale, which was shot within weeks of its conception. The mockumentary saw the band tour Europe to search for David Coverdale, who Walmsley claimed was his father.\nThe story initially saw the main characters travel to Africa with Clowns without Borders, an idea suggested by Walmsley in the early 2010s, but the COVID-19 pandemic led to a change of ideas. Kane was inspired by the films of Roland Emmerich. He analysed that the characters \"cannot let go of a profession\" that becomes their identity, though they are \"not necessarily born for it\". He said the lack of film studio involvement allowed niche cultural references in the script, like a mention of Rolf Harris.\nFilming took place on location for 23 days, across Dublin, Kildare and County Wicklow, Ireland. According to Kane, the budget was around $2 million. Despite this low budget, Kane aimed to create a \"big, broad theatrical comedy\" with action-adventure, \"textured locations\" and a significant soundtrack. Practical issues led to filming constraints. The first day required all scenes in Naherbawn to be filmed, as they could only shut down a town centre for one day. Forestry filming in a tent had to be completed within a day due to heavy rain. Earl contracted COVID-19 during the production, leading to use of a body double for circus scenes.\nApocalypse Clown was a co-production by Fastnet Films, Namesake Films and Umedia, with Morgan Bushe and James Dean as producers. It debuted at the Galway Film Fleadh on 14 July 2023, followed by an appearance at the Fantastia Festival, Montreal, and cinema release on 1 September 2023. The film was released by Vertigo Films and Wildcard Distribution in the U.K. and Ireland, with a 15A rating from the Irish Film Classification Office. Charades handled international licensing. It grossed $12,000 from 27 screens in its first week of release in the U.K. In October 2023, it was made available on Netflix in the U.K.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nAt the 2023 Galway Film Fleadh, Apocalypse Clown won Best Irish Film.\nSome reviews were positive towards the writing, acting, directing and comedy. Simon Henderson of Blazing Minds gave it 4.5 stars, enjoying the pathos, humour and directing. Henderson believed that each character contributes to the story and highlighted Funzo, who \"ranges from seeming innocence to apparent insanity, sometimes in the same scene\". Digital Spy's Ian Sandwell gave it four stars, writing that the strong script and cast supported the \"invention and madcap energy\". Sandwell lauded Palamides' \"deranged and hilarious\" performance for attention to detail, Earl's \"wholly endearing\" character and Foley's \"comic timing\", but criticised scenes that split up the trio.\nDonald Clarke rated it three stars for Irish Times, praising the range of clowns depicted, the \"antic derangement\" of Palamides and the director's ability to get the \"best out of comic actors in unlikely situations\". The Arts Desk's Sebastian Scotney lauded the \"hilarious, off the wall, beyond the cringe\" film for its \"well-cast actors playing engagingly wacky characters\". Scotney commented that the themes were influenced by the pandemic, in which the feasibility of art was questioned.\nOther reviews praised the acting, particularly by Palamides, but criticised aspects of the comedy or script. In a three-star review for The Guardian, Leslie Felperin reviewed the film as an \"absurdist farce\" with uneven humour but \"an antic scene-stealer of a performance\" by Palamides. For The List, Emma Simmonds criticised a lack of \"cinematic imagination\" by Kane and \"hit and miss\" comedy, but said the film had an \"inspired\" plot, good pacing and a strong cast. Joel Harley of Starburst rated it three stars, describing it as a \"unique\" road movie with jokes that \"wear thin\" despite the energy from Palamides and \"bombastic\" villainy from Kaye.\nFionnuala Halligan of Screen Daily found an \"unsustainability\" to the film's \"increasingly absurd\" and loosely connected sketches, as well as fast-paced but uneven comedy. Halligan said that Palamides was \"always worth watching\" and Earl \"commits to a lovely sad-sack performance\". In a two-star review, James Harvey of Why Now said that the film failed to find \"joy in its solid premise\", with a \"depressingly mean-spirited\" approach to its characters and puerile, dated humour. However, Harvey praised the \"laughs and heart\" of Palamides' \"terrifyingly expressive\" performance.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nApocalypse Clown on Netflix\nApocalypse Clown at IMDb",

        "content": "Henryk Minc (November 12, 1919 – July 15, 2013) was a Polish-born, British-educated, American professor of mathematics. He is known for his 1963 conjecture of what is now called the Bregman–Minc inequality (or Bregman's theorem), proved in 1973 by Lev M. Bregman.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHenryk Minc was born in Łódź, Poland to a Jewish family and had two brothers. In 1937 he graduated from secondary school in Poland. In 1938 he matriculated at Belgium's University of Liège. He returned to Lodz in August 1938 during summer vacation, but the outbreak of WW II caught his family by surprise. In November 1939 Henryk Minc escaped from Poland to Belgium. He and his two brothers survived WW II but their parents died in Auschwitz in August 1944. In May 1940 Henryk Minc escaped from Belgium to France, where he joined the Polish army. At the end of June 1940 he, as a member of a Polish engineer company, was evacuated to England and then stationed in Scotland until the allied invasion of Normandy in 1944. Minc was sent in May 1941 to an officer engineer school in Dundee, Scotland, and in 1944 was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the British army. Minc's Polish army unit was stationed in Tayport, Scotland. In April 1943 he married Catherine Taylor Duncan. The couple became the parents of three sons. In 1944 he was mainly involved in dismantling minefields. After eight years of military service, he matriculated at the University of Edinburgh. There he graduated with an M.A. in 1955 and a doctorate in mathematics in 1959. His doctoral dissertation Logarithmetics, Index Polynomials, and Bifurcating Root Trees was supervised by Ivor Etherington.From 1956 to 1958, Minc taught at Morgan Academy in Dundee, Scotland. From 1957 to 1958 he was lecturer at Dundee Technology College (now renamed Abertay University). At Canada's University of British Columbia, he was a lecturer from 1958 to 1959 and an assistant professor from 1959 to 1960. In 1960 he and his family immigrated to the United States. At the University of Florida, Gainesville he was an associate professor from 1960 to 1963. At the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), he was a full professor from 1963 to 1990, when he retired as professor emeritus. During the 1970s he was a visiting professor at the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology.In the early part of his mathematical career, Henryk Minc was interested in non-associative algebras and the intuitionist foundation of mathematics. He was one of the important mathematicians, along with Robert Charles Thompson and Ky Fan, recruited by Marvin Marcus, for the linear algebra and matrix theory school in UCSB's mathematics department. Minc and Marcus collaborated extensively. Minc was a leading expert on permanents and nonnegative matrices. At UCSB he was an outstanding member of the semiautonomous Institute for Interdisciplinary Applications of Algebra and Combinatorics and served on the editorial staff of Linear Algebra and Its Applications. He was the author or co-author of 10 mathematical textbooks and numerous research publications.In 1966, Marvin Marcus and Henryk Minc received the Mathematical Association of America's Lester R. Ford Award for their 1965 article Permanents.\n\n\n== Hobbies ==\nMinc published articles on Biblical archaeology and collected ancient Jewish coins and other antiquities. He spoke five languages and was able to read and understand ancient Hebrew and ancient Greek. Over a forty-year period for almost every day, he swam about a mile (1.6 km) each day. He played the harpsichord and the recorder, as well as bagpipes. During his retirement, he was an active participant in the Santa Barbara Scottish Society and, with his wife Catherine, visited Scotland many times. He developed a love for the poetry of Robert Burns and collected many books and manuscripts written by Burns. Minc was delighted when he was appointed the honorary president of the Robert Burns World Federation.\n\n\n== Family ==\nHenryk Minc was predeceased by his wife Catherine (1922–2008). Upon his death in 2013 in Santa Barbara, he was survived by his three sons, Robert (1944–2019), Ralph, and Raymond, and a grandson Jeffrey.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\n\n\n=== Articles ===\nMinc, H.

        "content": "Nuclear War: A Scenario is a 2024 non-fiction book by American journalist Annie Jacobsen. It outlines a timeline of a hypothetical first strike against the continental United States by North Korea.\n\n\n== Content ==\nThe book covers standard US military protocol in the event of a nuclear first strike against the United States. It particularly highlights launch on warning as a dangerous and potentially catastrophic policy of nuclear armed nations, and concludes that any nuclear conflict has the potential to end in near-total human extinction.\nThe book is structured to show a minute-by-minute breakdown from multiple perspectives of a scenario in which North Korea attacks Washington, DC with a Hwasong-17 ICBM and Diablo Canyon Power Plant with a Pukguksong-1 SLBM, destroying both completely and causing a nuclear meltdown. In response, the United States launches dozens of LGM-30 Minuteman ICBM missiles at North Korea, which must travel over the Arctic circle and Russia to reach its targets. Misunderstanding this as an attack on Russia, the Russian military launches a counterattack on the United States and NATO-allied states. After the scenario unfolds, a nuclear winter engulfs the planet, and renders the Northern Hemisphere uninhabitable.\n\n\n== Adaptation ==\nIn April 2024, it was announced that production studio Legendary Entertainment purchased the rights to adapt the book into a film, with Canadian director Denis Villeneuve set to direct.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nNuclear War: A Scenario. Dutton. 26 March 2024. ISBN 978-0593476093.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNuclear war\nThe 2020 Commission Report on the North Korean Nuclear Attacks Against the United States\nArms control\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mashiyama Masatomo (Japanese: 増山正同; March 29, 1843 – April 22, 1887) was a daimyo during the final years of the Edo period, holding the position of the eighth and final lord of the Ise-Nagashima Domain. He belonged to the ninth generation of the Masuyama clan in the Nagashima Domain and was later granted the title of viscount following the Meiji Restoration.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn on March 29, 1843, as the second son of Nagai Sanzaemon Nagata, a shogunate retainer with a position of 500 koku, he went by the names Yunosuke, Hayato, and Daigaku. His official rank was Junior Fifth Rank, Bicchu no kami. In 1852, he inherited the leadership of Masuyama Ginnosuke, a branch of the Masuyama clan from the Nagashima Domain, and became a retainer of the 1000 Tawara Kofusho-gumi, which was under the shogunate's control. This led to his incorporation into the Kofusho-gumi. In 1861, he was appointed Goshoin Banshi, and in 1866, he was appointed Goshuban, both of which were significant positions that contributed to the Meiji Restoration. Later, in 1869, he became part of the Yokosuka Magistrate's control, and historical records indicate that he resided at Mizuguchiya Gen'emon in Anzai 4-chome, Shizuoka Prefecture. During the same year, after the legitimate son of Masuyama Masanobu, the seventh lord of the Nagashima Domain, was disinherited, he was adopted by Masanobu. Following Masanobu's passing, he assumed the role of the clan's head. On June 24 of that year, he was appointed as a Chihanji due to the restoration of land ownership. Subsequently, on July 15, 1871, when the feudal domain system was abolished and the prefecture system was established, he was discharged from his position. He later relocated to Tokyo, and in 1876, he became a court priest, eventually rising to the position of chamberlain. In recognition of his contributions, he was granted the title of viscount in 1884, as per the Peerage Ordinance. He died on April 22, 1887, at the age of 45, leaving behind a legacy of service and dedication.\n\n\n== Real father ==\nAccording to Ito Shigenobu's Nagashima Town History (1974), it has been suggested that Nagai Nagata, the lord of the Yamato-Shinjo Domain, is the biological father of the individual in question. However, upon closer examination, it becomes evident that this claim is inaccurate for several reasons:\n\nThe death year of Nagai Nagata, the lord of the Shinjo domain, in 1825 does not align with his birth year, Tenpo 14 (1843), creating a discrepancy in the historical records.\nThe name \"Sanzaemon\" was not a childhood alias or commonly used name for Nagai Nagata, the lord of the Shinjo Domain, indicating a potential error or misunderstanding in historical documentation.\nAccording to the Peerage Detailed Tanzaku from the Historiographical Collection of the University of Tokyo, it is noted that Nagai Nagata's grandfather, Naokazu Nagai Oe (Shishichiro), passed away without being in charge of the flag, while his father, Nagai Oe Naokata (Sanzaemon), also passed away. This differs from the information typically associated with the feudal lord, suggesting a need for further investigation or clarification in historical accounts.\n\n\n== Family ==\nNagai Naokata (father)\nSakurai Sadatsu's daughter (mother)\nMasuyama Masanobu (adopted father)\nMizuno Kimiko, Shinnyoin – Mizuno Tadahiro's daughter\nMasuyama Masaharu – Mizoguchi Naoaki's eighth son\nMasuyama Masanori's room – Masuyama Masanori's daughter\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of han\nAbolition of the han system\nNagashima Domain\nMasuyama clan\n\n\n== References ==",

During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Battle of Avdiivka and subsequent capture of the city by Russian forces led to the village gaining the potential to become a frontline settlement after closer villages like Tonenke were taken in the days following. Between 30 March and 1 April, one of the largest Russian assaults of the war took place from Tonenke towards the village, but was stopped after incurring losses. The village is currently controlled by Ukrainian forces.\n\n\n== History ==\nAccording to the 2001 Ukrainian census, the village had a population of 176 people, of whom 53.98% said that their native language was Ukrainian, 45.45% said Russian, and 0.57% said Belarusian.\nOn 17 June 2020; Decree No. 33, Article 235 of the Verkhovna Rada placed the village in the administration of the Ocheretyne settlement hromada, also incorporating it into the significantly expanded Pokrovsk Raion.\n\n\n=== Russian invasion of Ukraine ===\n\nIn the Russian invasion of Ukraine beginning in February 2022; after the conclusion of the Battle of Avdiivka on 17 February 2024 and the subsequent capture of the city by Russian forces: the village began to be targeted by Russian artillery, and gained the potential to become a frontline settlement after closer settlements to the city were taken quickly in the days following. One such village closer to the city, Tonenke, was cited by the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces as a potential staging ground for future attacks towards Umanske, being located only 4 km (2.5 mi) away from the settlement. Between 30 March and 1 April 2024, this assessment proved itself correct, after a large Russian assault consisting of 36 tanks and 12 infantry fighting vehicles was stopped by the 25th Airborne Brigade on its approach from Tonenke. The attack saw 12 Russian tanks and 8 infantry fighting vehicles be hit by Ukrainian forces before the assault was halted. The attack was cited as one of the largest single Russian assaults of the war at the time it was carried out. Further Russian artillery strikes on the village took place in the days following in preparation for future assaults, but remains under Ukrainian control.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of villages in Donetsk Oblast\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Cameron McAdoo (born December 16, 1997) is an American professional Motocross and Supercross racer. McAdoo has competed in the AMA Supercross and AMA Motocross Championships since 2017.\nMcAdoo has had his greatest successes to date in Supercross, being a three-time main event winner as well as having multiple podium finishes to his name. He finished third in the 250SX West class in the 2021 AMA Supercross Championship.\nHe currently rides for the Monster Energy Pro Circuit Kawasaki team, but has also competed for GEICO Honda and Troy Lee Designs Red Bull KTM during his professional career.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Amateur career ===\nMcAdoo competed extensively in the American amateur ranks prior to turning pro. In the AMA Amateur National Motocross Championship, McAdoo did not achieve a top ten overall finish until his final year competing at the championship in 2016. After joining forces with the Smartop MotoConcepts team, he was able to finish fourth overall in the Open Pro Sport class and stand on the final step of the podium in the 250A class for 2016.Following this, McAdoo was victorious at the Monster Energy Cup supercross event in the Amateur All-Stars class, with a win in the second race combining with seventh in the opening race to give him the overall.\n\n\n=== Professional career ===\nMcAdoo made his professional supercross debut in 2017, starting in the 250SX East class of the AMA Supercross Championship for the Smartop Motoconcepts Honda team. By the third round of the series in Toronto, he was able to record his first top-ten finish before sustaining a cut to his hand at the fourth round which required stitches. Whilst recovering from the hand injury, McAdoo was signed by the factory GEICO Honda team as a replacement rider for the injured RJ Hampshire and Chase Sexton. At the final two rounds of the season, he was able to record two more top-ten finishes and following this he made his professional motocross debut with the GEICO team. His season in the 250 class of the AMA Motocross Championship was cut short after a shoulder injury sustained training in the week following the second round.\nAs part of his deal with the GEICO Honda team, McAdoo was retained for the 2018 season. Once again starting in the 250SX East class, McAdoo was able to achieve a personal best of eighth place at the second round. However, he would be out with a hand injury from the fourth round onwards. After recovering from this injury, McAdoo made a comeback at the fourth round of the 250 class in the AMA National Motocross Championship, finishing fifteenth in the final standings with a best of fifth overall at the tenth round. At the end of the season, McAdoo was drafted into the Penrite Honda Team for the final round of the Australian Supercross Championship, we he won the SX2 class. \nAt the end of 2018, McAdoo lost his ride with the GEICO Honda team but when the team was again hit by injuries pre-season, he was drafted back in for the 2019 AMA Supercross Championship. Competing in the 250SX West class, he finished inside the top-ten in all but one event and at the final round achieved his first professional podium with third in Las Vegas.Despite his fifth in the final 250SX West supercross standings, McAdoo was out of a ride again as the riders he replaced returned from injury. He was eventually picked up by the Troy Lee Designs Red Bull KTM team to ride in the 2019 AMA National Motocross Championship from the fourth round onwards. He was achieved several top-ten finishes with a best overall of sixth coming at the penultimate round of the 250 class. After the uncertainty around teams in the previous season, McAdoo found a home at the Monster Energy Pro Circuit Kawasaki team for the 2020 season. A crash in practice at the second round of the 250SX West class resulted in a collapsed lung which side lined him until the fifth round. Upon his return, he had a standout performance at the seventh round where he recorded his second professional podium by finishing third at the first Salt Lake City round. Following this, McAdoo was able to finish ninth in the final standings of the 250 class in the AMA Motocross Championship, becoming a consistent feature in the top-ten and recording a fourth overall at round two as his standout result.\nThe 2021 AMA Supercross Championship saw McAdoo step forward to become a championship contender for the first time. A second at the opening round of the 250SX West championship was followed up by his first ever professional supercross win in Daytona. This win also resulted in him gaining the championship lead following the event for the first time and a further four podiums across the remaining rounds saw him finish third in the final standings behind Justin Cooper and Hunter Lawrence. His breakthrough supercross season was followed by a motocross season that ended at the first round where he picked up a knee injury that took him out for the rest of the year. After recovering from his injury, McAdoo took on the 250SX East class in the 2022 AMA Supercross Championship, which started in the same vain of the previous year. After a second place in the opening round, he took his second professional supercross win in Arlington, once again taking the championship leader's red plate. Over the following three rounds he did not finish off the podium on each occasion, but, on the press day before the sixth round in St. Louis he sustained a shoulder injury that brought an end to his supercross season. Further injury problems disrupted his campaign in the 2022 AMA National Motocross Championship, resulting in him missing seven rounds of the season.\nMcAdoo's 2023 AMA Supercross Championship took a course similar to the one's immediately preceding it. Finishing third at the opening round, he podiumed at three of the next four rounds before picking up a shoulder injury before the sixth round. The injury required significant surgery which took him out for the remainder of the supercross season and the entire motocross season. McAdoo would not compete again until the 2024 AMA Supercross Championship where, in the 250SX East class, he recorded three second places across the first four rounds. At the third round in Indianapolis he took is third ever professional supercross win and with it the championship leader's red plate.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nAMA Supercross Championship\n\n250SX West: 2021 Monster Energy Cup\n\nAmateur All-Stars: 2016 AMA Amateur National Motocross Championship\n\n250A: 2016 \n\n\n== AMA Supercross/Motocross Results ==\n\n\n== References ==",

It was published in 1936 in Great Britain by Lovat Dickson & Thompson Limited and in Canada by Macmillan of Canada. Publications by other publishing houses, such as Charles Scribner's Sons in the United States, followed.: 297 \n\n\n== Contents ==\nTales of an Empty Cabin consists of three books: \"Book One: Tales of the Canadian Northland\" contains stories of the Canadian North, including an extended story, \"The Tree\", about the life of a jack-pine. \"Book Two: Mississauga\" recounts stories based on Grey Owl's experiences as a forest ranger in the Mississagi Forest Reserve. \"Book Three: Ajawaan\" consists of essays about the animals that Grey Owl observed and befriended in his position as \"caretaker of park animals\" in Prince Albert National Park.\nIn Tales of an Empty Cabin Grey Owl expressed his concerns about the future of the Canadian wilderness and wildlife. His feelings are epitomized by the following statement in the preface:\n\n The Wilderness should now no longer be considered as a playground for vandals, or a rich treasure trove to be ruthlessly exploited for the personal gain of the few—to be grabbed off by whoever happens to get there first. Man should enter the woods, not with any conquistador obsession or mighty hunter complex, neither in a spirit of braggadocio, but rather with the awe, and not a little of the veneration, of one who steps within the portals of some vast and ancient edifice of wondrous architecture.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGrey Owl\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "George Roberts (fl. 1726) was a British mariner.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nRoberts was the reputed author of ‘The Four Years' Voyages of Capt. George Roberts; being a Series of uncommon Events which befell him in a Voyage to the Islands of the Canaries, Cape de Verde, and Barbadoes … written by himself’ (8vo, 1726). According to this work, Roberts, after having been engaged for several years in the Guinea trade as captain of a ship, engaged himself in 1721 as chief mate for a voyage to Virginia, touching at Madeira, the Canaries, and Barbados. At Barbados, however, as the result of a difference of opinion with his captain, he fitted out a small sloop, in which he undertook a voyage to Guinea; but, being captured by pirates, who cleared the sloop out and detained his men, he was sent adrift, without sails, without provisions, and with no shipmates but a boy and a child. After various difficulties, the sloop was finally wrecked on the unfrequented island of St. John, one of the Cape Verd Islands, where Roberts remained two years, and got back to England in June 1725. It is suggested (Wilson, Life of Defoe, iii. 543) that the narrative is fictitious, and was written by Daniel Defoe, and this suggestion has been adopted in the British Museum ‘Catalogue.’ It seems unauthorised and unnecessary. The style is rather that of some humble and incompetent imitator of Defoe, whose story is very probably based on fact. No reason can be alleged for doubting the existence of Roberts or the substantial truth of the narrative. Watt, whom Allibone follows, seems to identify Roberts with a Mr. Roberts who was shipwrecked in 1692, and whose story of the disaster is published in William Hacke's ‘Collection of Original Voyages’ (London, small 8vo, 1699); but Mr. Roberts, commander and part owner of the vessel wrecked in 1692, can scarcely have been less than sixty in 1722; whereas George Roberts is described as a man of about thirty-five. William Lee (Life of Defoe, &c.) makes no mention of Roberts's narrative, thus tacitly denying Defoe's connection with it.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1896). \"Roberts, George (fl.1726)\".

She completed a bachelor's degree in music education in Ulaanbaatar. In 2014, she was one of the first students at the Goethe Musiklabor Ulan Bator. There, Martin Zenker prepared her for her master's degree in jazz at the University of Music and Theatre Munich. Also in 2014, she appeared in jazz clubs in Ulaanbaatar and on Mongolian state television. In 2015, she attended her first concerts in Germany. In 2016 she and her band were invited to the Koktebel Jazz Festival in Crimea. Between 2018 and 2020, she completed a master's degree in jazz singing in Munich, where she graduated with top grades.\nEnji's debut album Mongolian Song was released in 2018, which was followed in 2021 by the album Ursgal, mostly with her own compositions. Her \"unique blend of jazz and folk with the traditions of Mongolian song\" was highlighted on Deutschlandfunk. She became part of the young jazz scene in Munich, where she appeared as a guest singer and with pianists such as Sam Hylton and Vincent Eberle as well as with her own band in the relevant clubs. She toured South Korea on behalf of the Goethe-Institut, and in South Africa, she performed with Kevin Gibson and Andrew Lilley.\nIn July 2023, Enji released her third studio album, entitled Ulaan.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nMongolian Song (Enja 2018, with Johannes Enders, Paul Kirby, Martin Zenker, and Billy Hart)\nUrsgal (Squama  2021, with Paul Brändle, Munguntovch Tsolmonbayar, Moritz Stahl, and Alistair Duncan)\nEnji, Popp: 031921 5.24 5.53 (Squama 2022, EP)\nUlaan (Squama 2023, with Joana Queiroz, Paul Brändle, Munguntovch Tsolmonbayar, Mariá Portugal, and Matthias Lindermayr)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Martin Heidegger: Between Good and Evil (German: Ein Meister aus Deutschland. Heidegger und seine Zeit) is a 1994 biography about the philosopher Martin Heidegger, written by Rüdiger Safranski. It confronts Heidegger as someone who participated in a particularly German way of studying being, which Heidegger, according to Safranski, pushed further than anyone else, and where incomprehension became a deliberate feature due to a disbelief in the active human mind. The German title, which means \"A Master from Germany\", is an allusion to the poem \"Todesfuge\" by Paul Celan.\nRichard Rorty reviewed the book for The New York Times and wrote that it manages to display both Heidegger's pettiness and imaginative power. He called it \"the first comprehensive biography of the man\" and wrote that it supersedes books about Heidegger and Nazism by Victor Farías and Hugo Ott.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHanser",

He has previously played for Varberg in the Swedish top tier, Allsvenskan, and for Hammarby TFF in Ettan, the Swedish third tier.\n\n\n== Club career ==\nVilmer Rönnberg spent his youth career in Enskede IK, where he had his debut on the first team as 16 years old, playing in Division 2 which is the fourth tier of Swedish football. He gained a contract with the youth academy of Hammarby, where he played on the U17 and U19 teams until the end of 2021. He then moved to Hammarby's talent team, where he played for one season. He was not able to gain a professional contract with Hammarby, but instead Varberg offered him a contract. He played a full season for them in Allsvenskan, which is the top tier of Sweedish football. After Varberg was relegated, they had a new manager who made a lot of changes in the squad. Rönnberg decided to push his luck, and try something different. Thus he joined the Faroese top club B36 Tórshavn,  who is a regular participant in European club competitions. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVilmer Rönnberg at Svenskfotboll\nVilmer Rönnberg at Soccerway\nVilmer Rönnberg at FaroeSoccer.com\nVilmer Rönnberg at playmakerstats.com",

        "content": "Richard Tomson (fl. 1588) was a British mariner.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nTomson may presumably be identified with the Richard Tomson of Yarmouth (July 1570; State Papers, Dom. Eliz., lxxiii. 151), nephew of John Tomson of Sherringham. The mother of this Richard Tomson was an Antwerp woman, and one of her Flemish nephews, James Fesser, was a shipowner at Beeston. These Fessers, again, were cousins of John Fisher of Cley. Richard Tomson was for some years engaged in the Mediterranean trade, and in 1582 was involved in litigation with the Turkey company. He was also part owner of the Jesus of London, which was captured and taken to Algiers (ib. clxxviii. 83–4), to which in 1583 Tomson made a voyage to ransom the prisoners. In January 1588 he was in Flanders, and was there solicited by some Spaniards to undertake the delivery of a great quantity of iron ordnance, for which he would be handsomely paid. He refused their offer, and, knowing that the ordnance was for furnishing the Armada, informed Francis Walsingham of it, so that he might prevent the export. He appears to have corresponded confidentially with Walsingham, and may have been a kinsman of Laurence Tomson, Walsingham's secretary. In the summer of 1588 he was lieutenant of the Margaret and John, a merchant ship commanded by Captain John Fisher against the Armada, and mentioned as closely engaged with the galleon of D. Pedro de Valdes during the night after the first battle, in the battle of 23 July, in the capture of the galleass at Calais, and in the battle of Gravelines, of which he wrote an interesting account to Walsingham (Defeat of the Spanish Armada, Navy Records Society, freq.) Afterwards he was employed to negotiate with Don Pedro and other prisoners as to the terms of their ransom. On 3 April 1593 he wrote to Lord Burghley as to a permission lately given for the export of ordnance. This, he suspected, was for the Spaniards, and might cause trouble (State Papers, Dom. Eliz., ccxliv. 116). Towards the end of the century he was living in London, corresponding occasionally with Robert Cecil. It is possible that he was the Captain Tomson with the notorious pirate Peter Easton in 1611-12 (ib. James I, lx. 16; Docquet, 6 Feb. 1612); but the name is too common to render any identification certain.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1899). \"Tomson, Richard\".

She has published short stories, but she is best known for her debut novel Beasts of the Sea (2023), which was both a commercial and critical success upon publication. A time-hopping historical novel, it deals with the discovery of Steller's Sea Cow and the resonances of that discovery in following centuries. The book won the Helsingin Sanomat Literature Prize and was nominated for the Finlandia Prize and the Torch-bearer Prize. The translation rights have been sold in more than 20 languages, with the English translation due out in 2025 from Maclehose Press.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Jewish Sloboda, also known as Tuben-Aul (Russian: Еврейская Слобода) is an abolished village in the Kaytagsky District of the Republic of Dagestan. In the 1930s it was included in the village of Madzhalis.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe village was located on the left bank of the Ulluchay River, below the confluence of the Kotta stream. Currently it represents the lower part of the village of Madzhalis.\n\n\n== History ==\nBefore the Russian Revolution of 1917, a large community of Mountain Jews lived in Madzhalis, making up the Tuben-Aul (Lower Village) quarter. According to information from Valerian Zubov, a participant in the Persian expedition of 1796 in Madzhalis there were up to 200 houses of Mountain Jews who lived compactly in a quarter, separately from other residents of Madzhalis. It was a separate quarter on the edge of the village, where Mountain Jews moved from the gorge around the end of the 17th - beginning of the 18th centuries. A synagogue (closed in the 1930s, currently a residential building ) and a Jewish school operated in the quarter. In 1886, Mountain Jews owned 4 grocery stores and 5 manufacturing shops, owned 70 huts, 12.5 acres of arable land, 9 dessiatin of meadows, 3 gardens, 30 cattle, 25 horses. 25 Jews were engaged in tanning leather. Apparently, in the early 1920s, the Mountain Jewish quarter was separated into an independent settlement - the village of Jewish Sloboda. According to data for 1929, the village of Jewish Sloboda consisted of 69 households. Administratively, it was part of the Madzhalis village council of the Kaytagsky region of the Dagestan ASSR. In 1930, the Mountain Jewish agricultural artel “Kirmizy” (Red) was created, which united 12 households. Later, a collective farm named after Kaganovich was created on the basis of the artel. In 1938, the Kaganovich collective farm was merged with the “May First” collective farm in the village of Madzhalis. This circumstance led to the fact that Mountain Jews began to gradually leave the village, as they believed that it infringed on their interests.\n\n\n== Population ==\nIn 1867, 439 Mountain Jews lived in Madzhalis, in 1886–529, in 1897–512 (35.6%), in 1900–530. According to the 1926 Soviet census, 306 people lived in Jewish Sloboda (158 men and 148 women), this made up 100% of the population from Mountain Jews.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===",

        "content": "Aaron Smith (fl. 1823) was a British seaman who was kidnapped by pirates.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSmith was on 19 December 1823 tried at the Old Bailey on various charges of piracy in the West Indies, and especially of having plundered the ship Victoria of coffee, dyewood, and other articles to the value of 30,000l., and also of having plundered the ship Industry. The alleged facts were proved by competent witnesses; Smith's defence was that he was an unwilling agent. The story which he related in court was that, having been for about two years in the West Indies, he shipped as first mate on board the Zephyr brig; which sailed from Kingston for England in the end of June 1822. The master, an ignorant and obstinate man, had been warned against the leeward passage, which, however, he preferred as the shortest. The warning was justified, and the brig was taken possession of by a schooner manned by Spaniards and half-breeds, who plundered her of whatever seemed valuable, forced the master by threats of torture to deliver up what money he had on board, and then let them go, detaining Smith to act as navigator and interpreter, in which capacity he was compelled, by threats and actual torture, to act at the plundering of the Victoria, the Industry, and other vessels. After several months' detention he succeeded in escaping, but at Havana was recognised as one of the pirates, arrested, and thrown into prison; and as he refused or was unable to bribe the Spanish magistrates, who offered to release him on payment of one hundred doubloons, he was handed over to Sir Charles Rowley, the English commander-in-chief at Jamaica, and was brought to England in irons on board the Sybille. His tale, in part substantiated by witnesses, carried conviction to the judge, who summed up strongly in his favour; and the jury, without hesitation, returned a verdict of ‘Not guilty.’ He was described as ‘a very genteel-looking young man, apparently about thirty years old.’ ‘The Atrocities of the Pirates: a Faithful Narrative of [Smith's] Unparalleled Sufferings during his Captivity in Cuba’ (1824), was apparently a much embellished record by a sympathising friend.\nDuring the following years Smith continued at sea, and had command of a vessel in the China trade. In 1834 he retired and lived in London, doing, apparently, a little business as an underwriter, and also, it was said, as a bill discounter. On 31 January 1850 he attended a meeting at the London Tavern, called to petition parliament to do away with ‘head money’ for Borneo pirates, i.e. money paid by the government in lieu of prize-money for pirates officially sworn to have been killed. It was said that the pirates had no existence, and that harmless fishermen or people picked up on shore were killed for the head money. Smith—described as a burly seafaring man—stood up to contradict this, and said the pirates were very real; he himself had been attacked by them and his ship very nearly taken. The statement was referred to in the House of Commons on 23 May, in the debate on the navy estimates, and Mr. Cobden remarked that Smith was himself a pirate and deserved to be punished as such. The speech was reported in the ‘Times’ of the 24th, and on the 25th a Mr. E. Garbett wrote, in Smith's name, to Cobden, requesting an interview. This Cobden refused, and an angry correspondence followed (Times, 1 June), which brought up a Captain Cook, who wrote to say that Smith was certainly a pirate; that he himself had been captured and ill-treated by him (ib. 20 June). On this Smith brought an action for libel against Cook, who pleaded justification, and the case virtually resolved itself into trying Smith over again for acts of piracy said to have been committed twenty-eight years before, for which he had already been tried and acquitted. But by this time Smith's witnesses were either dead or lost sight of; there was no official report of the former trial, and Smith's ‘Narrative’ was clearly padded with a romantic love adventure, and necessarily open to suspicion. Eventually, however, a verdict was given in Smith's favour, but with damages of only 10l. (ib. 10 and 13 Dec.) He was at this time living in Camden Town, where he still was in 1852, after which his name disappears from the ‘London Directory.’\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1898). \"Smith, Aaron (fl.1823)\".

        "content": "Whitburn F.C. was an English association club based in Whitburn, near Sunderland, then in County Durham.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe club was founded in September 1882, \"at a meeting held at Mr Tinkler's\".  One of the club's founders, Alfred Grundy, who played in goal for the club, was the first secretary of the Durham County Football Association.\nThe club's earliest prominence came when it reached the semi-final of the Durham Senior Cup in 1886–87 and was only narrowly beaten by Sunderland at the latter's Newcastle Road ground; captain Dobson gave the village side a first-minute lead, and, after going 3–1 down, Whitburn brought the score back to 3–3, and had a goal disallowed for offside, before two late goals - one a deflection - put the favourites into the final.  The next season, the club entered the FA Cup for the first time, and was drawn at home to Middlesbrough.  Whitburn switched the tie, but was doubly disappointed, as bad weather kept the crowd down to 500, thus negating the supposed income advantage, and Whitburn went down 4–0.\nIt continued to enter the newly instituted qualifying rounds until 1891–92, never winning through to the first round proper again.  Its final tie was a remarkable match in the second qualifying round, losing 10–4 to Gateshead N.E.R. in a match that was level at 4–4 after 90 minutes, but the Railwaymen ran riot in extra-time (available as an option to clubs at the time).\nAs professionalism dominated, Whitburn stayed resolutely amateur, but had some success on a local level.  It played in the North-Eastern league in 1889–90, although the league petered out before completion, with the club close behind leaders Morpeth Harriers when the competition faded away.  The club thereupon became one of the founder members of the Northern Football Alliance in July 1890, but after finishing in the bottom two in 1892–93 it was not re-elected.\nIn May 1894, the club was elected to the Wearside League, a competition which the club remained in until its demise.  The club's reserves won the Sunderland Junior League in 1894–95, and the first team won the Wearside League for the only time in 1896–97.\nThe club long suffered from financial instability.  It came close to disbanding in 1922 when only 2 people turned up to its annual general meeting, and finally did so in June 1932, owing to a mix of debt (in its final season, the club took a loss of £13, against income of £65) and uncertainty about its ground.  A new Whitburn club started up in 1949, which lasted until the 1970s.\n\n\n== Colours ==\nThe club wore amber and black stripes  with white shorts.\n\n\n== Ground ==\nThe club's first ground was on the Seabank, and it originally used the Jolly Sailor public house for its facilities.  It moved to a new ground, between Lizard Lane and Bryers Street, in 1887, its first game there being a 12–1 win over Hebburn on 1 October; the new ground never seems to have had a more specific name than \"the Whitburn ground\".\n\n\n== Notable players ==\nJimmy Seed, who played for Whitburn before the First World War.\nWilliam Stephenson, who left the club for Hull City in 1907.\nJimmy Hugall, goalkeeper sold to Clapton Orient in 1910.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Henry (Hank) Rosso (13 June 1917 – February 1999) was a leader in the development of the fundraising profession in the United States. He began his fundraising career at the March of Dimes, where he helped to arrange the inaugural Mother's March on Polio. He was a founder of the Fund Raising School, which helped codify the principles, concepts, and techniques of the fundraising profession. In 1987, The Fund Raising School became part of the Indiana University Center on Philanthropy, now the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy.\n\n\n== Career ==\nRosso was born in Princeton, New Jersey. He served in the US Army Airborne Division during World War II and received a degree from Syracuse University in 1949.\nRosso got into the field of fundraising through his work in public relations. He was Director of Development and Public Relations at The Manlius School, and later worked as an executive with the consulting firms G. A. Brakeley & Co. and John Price Jones. Over the years, he did work for the United Way, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Planned Parenthood, and other nonprofit organizations.\nIn 1965, he founded the Development Executives Roundtable in San Francisco, a professional association that still exists today. The organization hosts a bi-annual Hank Rosso Forum together with the Association of Fundraising Professionals.\n\n\n== The Fund Raising School ==\nIn 1974, Hank and his spouse Dottie Rosso founded the Fund Raising School in San Rafael, California. Although many nonprofit and religious organizations had been securing charitable gifts of financial support for years, the Fund Raising School helped the profession align around systematic approaches, effectiveness, and ethics.\nAt the time of its founding, the Fund Raising School was an independent training program, but Rosso aspired to have it become part of a university, where the faculty could engage in research on philanthropy that would enhance the curriculum. In 1987, the Fund Raising School became part of the Indiana University Center on Philanthropy, now the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy. The school now offers graduate degrees including a doctoral degree (PhD) in philanthropic studies and a professional doctorate in philanthropic leadership (PhilD).\nA study guide for The Fund-Raising School used by fundraising expert Eugene Tempel, founding dean of the Center on Philanthropy, is in the collections of the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. Tempel considers the study guide “the foundation of [his] relationship with Hank Rosso and the kernel of the idea for creating the Center on Philanthropy and the Lilly School of Philanthropy.\"\n\n\n== Publications ==\nAchieving Excellence in Fund Raising by Henry A. Rosso and Associates was first published in 1991 and continues to be recognized as an authoritative textbook on the professional practice of fundraising. It describes each step in the fundraising cycle, such as setting goals, selecting appropriate fundraising techniques, soliciting gifts, and encouraging renewals.\nAchieving Excellence in Fund Raising is recommended reading for fundraisers studying to take the standardized exam required to receive a Certified Fund Raising Executive credential. It continues to be refined and updated by other fundraising experts. The 5th edition was published in 2022 and still contains Rosso's essay “A Philosophy of Fund Raising” from the original publication. In that essay, he describes fundraising as an honorable profession that is integral to all the work of a nonprofit organization. He defined fundraising as “the gentle art of teaching the joy of giving,” not a nuisance or a burden.\n\n\n== Honors and awards ==\nOutstanding Fund Raising Executive of the Year Award from National Society of Fund Raising Executives, 1985\nHonorary Doctor of Laws degree from Pacific Union College, 1987\nHenry A. Rosso Medal for Lifetime Achievement in Fund Raising from Indiana University, 1990\nHonorary Doctor of Laws degree from Indiana University, 1992\nStaley/Robeson/Ryan/St. Lawrence Prize for Research on Fund-Raising and Philanthropy presented by the National Society of Fund Raising Executives, for the book Achieving Excellence in Fund Raising, 1992\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Lilly Family School of Philanthropy\".

        "content": "William Scoresby (3 May 1760 – 1829) was an English arctic navigator.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nScoresby was the son of a small farmer at Cropton, twenty miles from Whitby. He was born on 3 May 1760. After attending the village school he was employed about the farm from the age of nine, and occasionally worked for neighbouring farmers. In his twentieth year he bound himself for three years as an apprentice to the captain of a ship called the Jane, trading from Whitby to the Baltic. He joined her in March 1780. He had already studied navigation, his knowledge and practice of which enabled him, in the second year of his service at sea, to detect an error in the reckoning which would otherwise have caused the loss of the ship. The only reward he got was the ill-will of the mate, whose blunder he had exposed. This caused him to leave the ship at London in October 1781, and enter on board an ordnance ship, the Speedwell, carrying out stores to Gibraltar. At the entrance of the Straits the Speedwell fell in with the Spanish fleet and was captured. Her men were taken to Cadiz, and thence sent inland to San Lucar de Mayor, from which, being carelessly guarded, Scoresby and one of his companions managed to escape. After various adventures they succeeded in reaching Cadiz, where they got on board an English cartel and were taken to England. On his return home Scoresby engaged once more in farm work during 1783 and 1784. Meantime he married the daughter of a neighbouring farmer, and, with the prospect of a family, his old ambition returned. In the spring of 1785 he engaged himself on board the ship Henrietta, employed in the Greenland whale fishery, and for the next six years continued in her, going to Greenland each summer, and in the winter taking casual employment on board coasting vessels. After the voyage of 1790 the captain of the Henrietta retired on his savings, and recommended Scoresby as his successor. The owner appointed Scoresby to the command. After commanding the Henrietta for seven seasons, Scoresby's reputation in the trade stood high, and in the beginning of 1798 he accepted the more advantageous offers of a London firm to command their ship, the Dundee of London. The Dundee was as successful as the Henrietta. In 1802 he joined a small company at Whitby, thus becoming owner of one-eighth of a new ship, the Resolution, of 291 tons, which he was to command on the same terms as had been given him by the London firm. From 1803 to 1810 inclusive he sailed each season in her, and each season returned with a good cargo, the profits to the company being at the average rate of 25 per cent. per annum on the capital invested.\nAt the end of the voyage of 1810 he resigned the command of the Resolution in favour of his son, and himself took command of the John, belonging to the Greenock whale-fishing company, consisting of four partners, of whom he was one. After the season of 1814 he resigned the John in favour of his daughter's husband, and remained on shore in 1815. In the following year he was at sea again in command of the Mars of Whitby, belonging to one of his partners in the Resolution. In the autumn of 1817 he bought, entirely on his own account, a teak-built ship, the Fame, brought into England as a prize from the French. He had hopes that she might be taken up by the government for a voyage of arctic discovery under the command of his son, and only at the last moment, when the government resolved otherwise, made up his mind to send her to the fishery. In 1819 and the three following years he took command of her himself. She sailed for another voyage in 1823, but was accidentally burnt at the Orkneys. Scoresby, having now acquired a ‘handsome competence,’ returned to Whitby, where he lived till his death in 1829.\nThe net profits of Scoresby's thirty voyages as a captain were estimated at 90,000l., or an average of upwards of 30 per cent. per annum on the capital employed. He is described as of about six feet in height, and of extraordinary muscular power, a first-rate seaman and navigator, and of a judgment which, cultivated by experience and reflection, became almost instinctive. It was this that, in May 1806 for instance, led him to force the Resolution through the pack into open water beyond the 80th parallel, when he attained the latitude of 81° 30′, long the highest reached by a ship, and completed his cargo in thirty-two days with ‘twenty-four whales, two seals, two walruses, two bears, and a narwhal.’ Exploration was not his business, but he did much to render arctic navigation more certain, and more feasible, by the introduction of new methods, and by inventions, such as the ice-drill, or improvements of fittings, such as the crow's nest, the shelter for the look-out at the masthead, in which he was accustomed to spend hours, or even days. He married, in 1783, Lady Mary Smith (Lady Mary being her Christian name, given her in commemoration of her having been born on Lady-day), daughter of John Smith of Cropton, and had issue. His son William was also an Arctic explorer.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1897). \"Scoresby, William (1760-1829)\".

        "content": "On April 5, 2024, at 10:23 EDT (14:23 UTC), a Mw 4.8 earthquake occurred in the U.S. state of New Jersey, with the epicenter in Tewksbury Township. While it was felt across the New York metropolitan area, Delaware Valley, the Washington D.C metropolitan area, and other parts of the northeastern United States between Virginia and Maine, it had a relatively minor impact, with no major damage reported. There were dozens of aftershocks throughout the rest of the week and into the next.\nIt was the strongest earthquake to affect New Jersey since the 5.3 Mfa 1783 New Jersey earthquake, and the strongest to hit New York City since an estimated 5.0 magnitude earthquake on August 10, 1884.\n\n\n== Tectonic setting ==\nThe causative fault for the earthquake was likely in the area of the Ramapo Fault zone, which extends from Pennsylvania to New York and was formed by the break-up of the supercontinent Pangaea during the Late Triassic. Another possible origin is the Flemington Fault, a younger fault in the same area.\nThe Whitehouse Station, New Jersey area had previously experienced an earthquake on March 14, 2024. The USGS considers this to be part of the event sequence.\n\n\n== Earthquake ==\nThe earthquake had a moment magnitude of 4.8 and a depth of 2.9 miles (4.7 km). Its epicenter was in Tewksbury Township, New Jersey, at 40.689°N 74.754°W, about 1 mile (1.6 km) north of Oldwick and 5 miles (8.0 km) east of Lebanon. Tremors were felt all across the Northeastern United States from Maine in the north to Washington, D.C., and Norfolk, Virginia, in the south.\nAs of April 12, over 50 aftershocks were reported, the strongest of which had a magnitude of 3.7 and took place about 4 miles (6 km) from Gladstone around 17:59. The USGS projected a 12% chance of an aftershock with a magnitude greater than 3 and a 1% chance of a stronger earthquake with a magnitude above 4. An aftershock of 2.6 was felt about 5 kilometres (3 mi) southwest of Gladstone on about 10:25 AM local time on April 10.\n\n\n== Impact ==\nSeveral buildings in New York City, Philadelphia, and Long Island were shaken. The USGS estimated that the earthquake was felt by about 42 million people in the area.\nThe earthquake interrupted a meeting of the Security Council on the Israel–Hamas war at the United Nations Headquarters in Manhattan, while a performance at the New York Philharmonic was briefly delayed by cell phones sounding an alert at 11:02, which was sent about 40 minutes after the earthquakes were felt. Gas leaks were reported in Rockland County, New York, and an administrative building in Morristown, New Jersey. In Huntington, New York, a vehicle was damaged after falling into a sinkhole shortly after the earthquake.\nUp to 150 buildings were damaged across New York City, and a school gym in East New York sustained damage. Four three-story houses on Seventh Avenue in Newark, New Jersey, were damaged by the earthquake. Twenty-eight residents were evacuated, but no injuries were reported. Three of the houses were \"partially toppled\" and were subsequently condemned. The upper portion of the 264-year old Col. John Taylor's Grist Mill collapsed into a road. Additionally, the earthquake caused water main breaks in Essex County and Morris County.\nDamage to a Northeast Philadelphia home was the only confirmed report of structural damage caused by the earthquake in Pennsylvania.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe Federal Aviation Administration completely halted flights at Newark Liberty International Airport, Philadelphia International Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport. Arrivals into Baltimore/Washington International, LaGuardia, and Teterboro Airports were delayed. The air traffic control tower at Newark Liberty International Airport was also evacuated. Five flights bound for Newark were diverted to Lehigh Valley International Airport in Allentown, Pennsylvania.\nThe first emergency alert sent to New York City residents came 26 minutes after the earthquake to subscribers of the Notify NYC service. A Wireless Emergency Alert was sent out to the broader region even later, with New Yorkers reporting it arriving 40 minutes after the earthquake. Amid criticism, New York City Emergency Management Commissioner Zach Iscol defended the delayed response in a press conference, saying that \"Twenty minutes is very fast for a public alert,\" and that they needed that time to confirm that it was indeed an earthquake.\nThe PATCO Speedline was temporarily suspended for inspection \"out of an abundance of caution.\" Amtrak train speeds were restricted throughout the Northeast while railroad tracks were being inspected for damage, and NJ Transit trains on all lines were expected to be delayed by up to 20 minutes due to track inspection. AirTrain Newark at the Newark Liberty International Airport was also closed for inspection while its flights were ungrounded.\nThe Holland Tunnel, a major crossing of the Hudson River, was briefly closed for inspection between 11:00 and 11:15 local time. The Lincoln Tunnel was also briefly closed, backing up traffic in Weehawken.\nWithin hours of the earthquake, a custom T-shirt shop in Manhattan began printing a joke souvenir reading \"I survived the NYC earthquake April 5, 2024.\" The store put it on the shop window and a pedestrian took a photo of it, which was shared widely on social media, causing hundreds of sales.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nSeismicity of the New York City area\nList of earthquakes in the United States\nList of earthquakes in 2024\n2011 Virginia earthquake – felt in New York City and New Jersey\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

It was released on 5 April 2024 through Nuclear Blast and was produced by Janne Saksa.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe album received generally positive reviews from critics. Sam Khaneka of Distorted Sound scored the album 7 out of 10 and wrote that the album \"feels like Korpiklaani trying to find a careful balance of the two, with just enough variety to keep things interesting but without stepping far off their well beaten path.\" Writing for Metal Hammer, Holly Wright called the album \"one of Korpiklaani's better latter-day albums that continues their legacy of authentic, Finnish revelry\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nKorpiklaani\n\nJonne Järvelä – vocals, guitar\nKalle \"Cane\" Savijärvi – guitar\nJarkko Aaltonen – bass\nSamuli Mikkonen – drums\nSami Perttula – accordion\nOlli Vänskä – violin\nAdditional personnel\n\nJanne Saksa – production\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

The song has been described as \"an iridescent folk rock that revives Mogol's pantheism, rudimentary but effective\".\nBattisti recorded the song in Spanish as \"La colina de las cerazas\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLa collina dei ciliegi at Discogs (list of releases)",

Prakash Kumar and Aishwarya Rajesh in the lead role, alongside Rohini, Kaali Venkat, Ilavarasu, and Thalaivasal Vijay.\nThe film was officially announced in December 2022 under the tentative title Production No. 3, as it is the third production for the former house, and the official title was announced in May 2023. Principal photography commenced the same month as the former month, and wrapped by early August 2023. The film has music composed by G. V. Prakash Kumar, cinematography handled by Jagadeesh Sundaramoorthy, and editing by Rukesh.\nDear was theatrically released on 11 April 2024.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nOn 11 December 2022, Nutmeg Productions officially announced their third production venture, which would be helmed by Sethum Aayiram Pon (2019) director Anand Ravichandran. The project would feature G. V. Prakash Kumar and Aishwarya Rajesh in the lead role, pairing opposite each other in the film, in their maiden pairing. The technical crew consisting of Prakash (as the music composer), cinematographer Jagadeesh Sundaramoorthy and editor Kripakaran was revealed along with the official stills of the muhurat puja held the same day in Chennai. The film's official title, Dear, was announced on 4 May 2023.On the similarities of the storyline between Dear and Good Night, Anand stated \"I know Manikandan, who’s playing the hero in that film, through a common friend. Before we went to shoot, we sat down and spoke. Except for the fact that the films are about snoring, they are vastly different in terms of treatment. Ours is more commercial, and even visually, the treatment is different.\" According to Anand, most of the film was shot with sync sound; as he found it too difficult to recreate \"the beauty of drama\" through dubbing. On 5 April 2024, with the release of the film's trailer, Kripakaran was revealed to have been replaced by Rukesh due to reasons unknown.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nPrincipal photography began with the first schedule on 11 December 2022. After being predominantly shot in Chennai, principal photography wrapped on 1 August 2023 with a cake-cutting celebration.\n\n\n== Release ==\nDear was theatrically released on 11 April 2024.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDear at IMDb",

        "content": "26°1′3.90″N 42°18′0.43″E  Qetn Mountains is formed of a group of mountains located between Al-Qassim and Medina in Saudi Arabia. These form a circular ring that encloses a shaban full of Acacia trees. It is administratively affiliated with Aqlah Al-Suqur Governorate and is ten kilometers away from it.\n\n\n== About the mountain ==\nThe history of Qetn extends back to the early ages of Islam, as evidenced by the statements of some historians that Qetn was contested by Abs and Asad in the early ages of Islam. It was mentioned in Al-Aboudi's Lexicon of Al-Qassim Country, where he said: \"Qetn is a very red mountain because it appears red to the beholder\". Qetn is located west of Al-Qassim, 170 kilometers from the city of Buraydah, and the traveler traveling from Al-Qassim to Medina will see it on his right before he reaches Aqlat al-Suqur. It was famous in the old days, so much so that Al-Hafiz said: \"It is a famous mountain\" and Ibn Ishaq said: \"Qetn from the waters of Asad tribe in Najd\".\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe inhabitants of Qetn are the Qusayrin of Muzaynah from the tribe of Harb.\n\n\n== Mentions of the mountain by geographers ==\nAbu Ishaq al-Harbi: He talks about the Basra pilgrim's route to Medina: Then they march to Al-Fawwarah and stay there, it has many water springs and palm trees, which belonged to Isa ibn Ja'far. Then they go out, and when they are six miles beyond it, Qetn appears on their right. If they pass it, the land expands and the mountains are carved out for them. If they go beyond it, the land expands and the mountains are carved out for them, that's where it's misleading. Those who go astray go to Batn al-Rumma and stay there, It has a stream that always has water, but there are no people in it.\nAl-Hamdani mentions it in his book Description of the Arabian Peninsula when he talks about the habitats of the Arabs from Bahrain and Yamama to Najd. He paired it with other mountains, saying: Darij, Al-Uthaib, Qetn, Thitel, Al-Sattar, Yathbul, and Masal are mountains.\nIbn Abduraboh: Some of the days that took place in or near Qetn, including the day of Dhi Hassi, and Dhubyan against Abs, in order to take revenge for what happened to them on the day of Al-Murayqib. They came to Dhi Hassi, which is the valley of Safa from the land of Sharbah, and between it and Qetn is three nights.\nIbn Abdraboh: When they met for reconciliation - i.e. Abs and Dhubyan - Abs tribe stood at Qetn, and Husayn ibn Dhammam came and met Tehan, one of the sons of Makhzum ibn Malik, and killed him with his father Dhammam. Antara ibn Shaddad had killed him at Dhi al-Muraqib, so the Abs tribe and their allies advised Nu'abdullah ibn Ghutfan and said: We will not reconcile with you until the sea has washed away its wool, and you have betrayed us many times, and the people of Abs and Dhubyan met at Qetn then, Amr ibn Al-Asla'a killed Uyayna on that day, then ambassadors traveled between them, and Khargha ibn Sinan brought his son and introduced him to Abu Tihan, he said: \"This is truthfulness from your son, so he took him and was with him for a few days, then Kharja carried a hundred camels to Abu Tihan and led them to him. Then they agreed and made a covenant.\nAl-Bakri said of him in the drawing of Qatan: it's a mountain. Abu Hanifa said, \"Qetn is a mountain in Najd, in the country of Asad tribe, on your right if you leave Hijaz and you are coming from Naqra\". Abu Ishaq said: Qetn: One of the waters of Asad tribe in Najd, to which the Prophet Muhammad sent Aba'aslamah Ibn Abdul Asad in a squad, and Masud ibn Urwa was killed in it.\n\n\n== Folk legend ==\nOne of the folk legends of the region's inhabitants is that Tumaya mountain is a female mountain located in the Hejaz in western Saudi Arabia in the Umm al-Dum region, (Harrat Kishb) is a reddish-black color that has fallen in love with the beautiful mountain, Qetn, which is yellowish-white in color. In her adoration of him, she flew away to where the site of its quarry is called Maqlaa Tumaya, heading to Aqlat al-Suqur. On the way, her stones were falling until she reached the Qetn area. But on her way to him, she was seen by another mountain called Akash Mountain, which was jealous of Qetn, so he shot her with a spear, knocking her to the ground before she could reach Qetn. Then he married her and gave birth to a little black-colored mountain called Dim, which is still known by that name today. Later, Qetn rode the red plateau called Albakra and rode it to Tumaya after she left Akash and separated from him.\nIbn Labboun says that the same plants that grow in Harrat Kishb are found in Tumaya mountain. These plants do not grow in the Najd region, which is why some people believe this legend.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of mountains in Saudi Arabia\n\n\n== References ==",

It is not acceptable in an encylopedia to write something like \"often regarded as a paragon of knowledge and an epitome of wisdom, embodying profound understanding and discernment\" and source this to the subject's own lectures! Greenman (talk) 06:54, 11 April 2024 (UTC)\n\nSheikh Mustafa Haji Ismail Harun is a well-known sheikh in the area where Somalis live, and he is a preacher who is widely known for spreading the cause of Islam and developing human potential.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nSheikh Mustafa was born on the outskirts of the rural town of Burao in the Togdheer region, before the independence of the Republic of Somalia between the 1940s – 1960s. His family were priests; his father was known as Haji; he was a sheikh; and his great-grandfathers were scholars. Sheikh and his family lived in Aden, Yemen, for 45 years and returned to the country in 1963.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nSheikh Mustafa pursued his early education in the Togdheer region, completing primary school before graduating from the German Institute in Burao. Specializing in electrical engineering, he furthered his academic journey at the University of Somalia, obtaining his degree in 1980.\nThe sheikh worked as a teacher at the Institute of Electrical Engineering German in Burco for a year and a half. After being arrested by the Somali government at the time, he was imprisoned in many places, including the police station, NSS, Gulwade Camp, Military camp, and prisons. He sometimes spent years in prison but was never brought to trial.\nIn late 1974, Sheikh Mustafa encountered the renowned preacher Sheikh Abdulkadir Nur Farah during a Hajj season. Sheikh Mustafa mentioned that he was part of the group to whom the books on Usul al-Fiqh (Principles of Islamic Jurisprudence) and Mustalah al-Hadith (Hadith Terminology) were taught by Sheikh Abdulkadir.\nAfter relocating to Burao in northern Somalia, Sheikh Mustafa memorized these books 13 times. He also asserted that the knowledge of Uslu, for which Sheikh Abdul Karim Hasan Hosh gained renown as a prominent Usuli scholar in Burao, originated from the treatise on Uslu that was taught to their group. His religious education was under the guidance of esteemed scholars in Somalia, with Sheikh Abdulkadir Nur Farah serving as his mentor.\nSheikh Mustafa has a Norwegian passport, and he is a cleric and scholar known for his diverse knowledge and sagacity. He is recognized for his contributions in various fields, including Islamic theology and jurisprudence. As a cleric, he holds a leadership role within the Muslim community. His educational background spans multiple disciplines, reflecting a comprehensive understanding of religious studies and potentially other academic areas.\nSheikh Mustafa is acknowledged for his wisdom and discernment, contributing to his respected position in both the Somali and Norwegian Muslim communities. Sheikh Mustafa Hajji Ismail Haruun is often regarded as a paragon of knowledge and an epitome of wisdom, embodying profound understanding and discernment within his role as a Muslim cleric and scholar.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Adrenalin Misfits (also known as Crossboard 7 in Europe and Japan) is a sports-racing video game both developed and published by Konami. The game was released on November 4, 2010, in North America, and on November 10, 2010, in Europe for the Xbox 360. The game uses the Kinect motion sensor.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe game involves players utilizing motion controls to navigate downhill courses by leaning, jumping, and performing tricks. The main objective is to race against opponents or the clock to reach the finish line.\nPlayers unlock new courses, characters, and boards as they progress through the game, each with unique attributes and abilities. Tricks such as grabs and flips can be performed to earn points and increase speed.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nAdrenalin Misfits received \"mixed or average\" reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic.\nJan Wöbbeking for 4Players rated the game 50%, stating that \"The game is still good for a fun balloon hunt or a quick downhill run every now and then, especially if you are no longer dependent on the weak beginner boards. However, Crossboard 7 is not suitable as a serious alternative to Shaun White or Mario Kart Wii.\"\nEllie Gibson for Eurogamer rated the game 3/10, stating that \"Another boarding game! And yes, it's just like Sonic Free Riders! Except Sonic and the stupid albatross have been replaced by a weird green wolf thing and an annoying surfer dude monkey.\"\nGamekult rated the game 5/10, stating that \"With Crossboard 7, Konami offers Kinect a first fun sliding game, but without influence.\" Mark Walton for GameSpot rated the game 5/10, stating that \"Unless you're desperate for a Kinect boarding experience and have some friends to play with, Crossboard 7 is best left to shred the slopes alone.\"\nTaylor Cocke for GamesRadar+ rated the game two out of five stars, stating that \"If you were hoping for a Kinect-friendly great snowboarding game, this isn't the one. It controls terribly and is just plain uninteresting. Don't bother unless you're desperate for some XTREEM action. And we mean XTREEM in the worst possible manner.\"\nJack DeVries for IGN rated the game 5/10, stating that \"Adrenalin Misfits isn't broken, it's not hard, it's not hideous. It's just kind of boring and uninspired. Konami played it safe with this one, and ended up with a title that feels like an extended tech demo more than a full-fledged game.\"\nGameTrailers in their video review, rated the game 5.2/10, stating that \"Even if you're a fan of snowboarding games, you'll struggle with almost everything that Adrenalin Misfits has to offer.\" GameZone rated the game 4.5/10, stating that \"Even if you’re a fan of snowboarding games, you’ll struggle with almost everything that Adrenalin Misfits has to offer.\"\nMetro rated the game 3/10, stating that \"this is slightly the better of the two games but not by much. Its advantage is simply that it's not as overcomplicated as the Sonic game, but instead a sort of bog standard SSX clone that is relatively attractive and features a fairly varied range of backdrops.\"\nJorge Cano for Vandal rated the game 6/10, stating that \"Crossboard 7 is clearly aimed at a young audience, from its aesthetics to the low difficulty of completing it, and we believe that a child would have a blast moving and jumping while playing with Kinect.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAdrenalin Misfits at MobyGames",

Later, they were brought near the village of Trnovo, where they were systematically executed. The tape reportedly showed the members firing upon a refugee column on the Pale–Srebrenica road and littering their corpses on the road.\nAfter the war, it was passed around as a war souvenir by the members of the group. The commander ordered the destruction of all tapes, but one managed to stay by a member of the group. In 2005, a recording of the tape was shown during the trial of Slobodan Milošević.\n\n\n== 2007 recovery and broadcasting ==\nIn 2007, Nataša Kandić had recovered a copy of the original tape from a man in Šid, reportedly a part of the paramilitary group, who provided it only on the condition that she not air it until he had safely left the country. A cut 28 minute version was broadcast on Serbian and Bosnian television. The Guardian described the tape as the \"smoking gun\" and \"the final, incontrovertible proof of Serbia's part in the Srebrenica massacres.\" The New York Times called the airing of the tape on Serbian television a \"watershed\" moment for the country.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2021 Movement for Change leadership election took place on 5 December 2021, in which six candidates took part. Since none of the candidates received 50% of the vote, a runoff election took place in 12 December, between Nikos Androulakis and George Papandreou.\nThe other candidates that took part were: Andreas Loverdos, Haris Kastanidis, Pavlos Geroulanos, and Pavlos Christidis. Nikos Androulakis won the runoff.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn 19 November 2017, the second round of the 2017 Greek centre-left leadership election took place, with Fofi Gennimata defeating Nikos Androulakis. Political parties that took part in the elections then moved on to the founding of the Movement for Change on 16 March 2018.\nOn 7 July 2019, early elections took place, in which the Movement for Change received 8,10% of the vote, along with the third place with 22 MPs. The percentage was considered disappointing by the party, blaming the President for it, expressed primarily from Pavlos Geroulanos. On November the 11th Congress of PASOK took place, aiming to extend the President's term till 2021, and also it was decided to combine the organs of Movement for Change with those of PASOK.\nA conversation regarding the leadership elections started from the fall of 2020 within the Movement for Change, with Fofi Gennimata declaring that she would again stand as a candidate for them. On 25 November, Nikos Papandreou, MEP candidate in the 2019 EP elections, announced his candidacy for the position, but on 2 December, he suspended it. On 23 January 2021, Andreas Loverdos announced his candidacy for the leadership. Nikos Androulakis officially announced his candidacy in July 2021. On 1 September Haris Kastanidis also announced his candidancy.\nOn 3 October the Central Committee was convened, aiming to decide over the leadership elections. It was decided that the elections would take place on December 5, and the second round on the 12th. The candidates, according to the statute, are required to collect 5.000 movement member signatures, to get their candidacy approved. However, that was not specified at the meeting, as candidates were in disagreement. Anyone that wants to vote, can sign up as a member or a friend of the party up until the elections, paying 3 Euros in the process.\nOn 12 October, Fofi Gennimata announced her withdrawal from the electoral process, due to health reasons.\nOn 13 October, Vassilis Kegkeroglou started collecting signatures, and announced his intention to run as a candidate and later, Pavlos Geroulanos also announced his candidacy. On 15 October, Pavlos Christidis announced his candidacy and resigned as  Press Representative. On the same day, the final day for collecting signatures was moved from the 15th to 21 October. On 20 October, former Prime Minister, George Papandreou announced his candidacy. The next day, Vassilis Kegkeroglou withdrew from the electoral process, due to the candidacy of Papandreou.\nOn 22 October, the Statute Implementation and Certification Ethics Committee of the Movement of Change, after reviewing the collected signatures, officially declared the candidates.\nOn 25 October, the President of the Movement for Change, passed away at age 56 at Evangelismos Hospital from Cancer.\nO 29 November, a debate took place on ERT, between five of the six candidates, while George Papandreou disagreed with the process and refused to take part. Questions were taken by Giorgos Kouvaras, Tasos Pappas and Pavlos Tsimas, while Antrianna Paraskevopoulou was the moderator.\nOn 5 December, the first round of the leadership elections took place. Nikos Androulakis reached the first place, George Papandreou reached the second spot. With the seond round incoming, Andreas Loverdos backed Nikos Androulakis, while the other three candidates did not publicly back anyone.\nOn 12 December, the second round of the leadership elections took place. Nikos Androulakis came out as the winner, defeating George Papandreou, with a percentage of 67,60%.\n\n\n== Candidacies ==\n\n\n=== Candidates ===\n\n\n=== Withdrawn candidates ===\n\n\n== Debate ==\n\n\n== Opinion polling ==\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n=== By Region ===\n\n\n==== First Round ====\n\n\n==== Second Round ====\n\n\n== References ==",

It opened in 1930 with 11 tenants and was anchored by two grocery stores: an A&P and a Piggly Wiggly. The center is still in operation, currently anchored by Target. It was built in an L shape with dedicated parking space for shoppers in the front, a novelty at the time. This stood in contrast to the limited availability and harried experience of street parking in front of stores lining busy streets. The original developer was Shannon & Luchs and the architect was Arthur B. Heaton.\nStores mentioned in a 1930 ad were:\n\nThe center still exists, anchored by a Target store. It is considered a model or \"template\" for future such neighborhood centers, or even \"a pioneering example of strip-mall architecture\", and for that reason has been subject to historic preservation efforts.\nIt was sold in 2020 to Asana Partners for $39 million.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Who Stole My Monkey? is an album by the American musician Boozoo Chavis, released in 1999. He is credited with his band, the Majic Sounds (billed on the cover as the Magic Sounds). Who Stole My Monkey? was the first zydeco album to include a Parental Advisory label. Chavis supported the album with a North American tour.\n\n\n== Productin ==\nRecorded at Dockside Studio, in Maurice, Louisiana, the album was produced by Scott Billington. Chavis's son Charles sang lead on \"Sock It to Me\" and \"Marksville Slide\". The album packaging advises that the concluding two songs, \"Uncle Bud\" and \"Deacon Jones\", are not suitable for airplay due to their X-rated lyrics; the songs were originally released as \"under-the-counter\" 45s. \"Lucille\" is a version of the Clifton Chenier song.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe Charleston Daily Mail wrote that Chavis's \"chugging, circular, single-chord style has proved to be all but inimitable.\" The Orlando Sentinel said that \"Boozoo, [bassist Classie] Ballou and guitarist Carlton 'Guitar' Thomas create complicated harmonic structures with Thomas sometimes echoing Boozoo's phrases, sometimes embellishing them, sometimes supporting them with simple chords and sometimes developing miniature counter-melodies.\" The Wall Street Journal determined that Chavis's \"in-your-face style marks a throwback to a day when musical intensity mattered more than pristine technique or production values.\"\nThe Chicago Tribune stated that Chavis \"bypasses familiar verse-chorus-verse structures and 4/4 tempos for old-fashioned, cycling riffs and off-kilter, two-step grooves.\" The San Diego Union-Tribune determined that \"his earthy, no-fuss music combines Creole and Cajun traditions with blues, without diluting any of them.\" The Washington Post opined that the title track gets \"mired in the same old drum-bass-rubboard boom-scratcha boom-scratcha of a dozen other zydeco songs.\" The Tucson Citizen praised the \"reedy squeezebox, good-time vocal delivery and playful way with the lyric.\"\nAllMusic wrote that \"Boozoo lays down tunes just like he was working a dance in Louisiana rather than making a record in the sterile confines of a recording studio.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Michael Salisbury (born 1985) is an English professional football referee and former teacher who belongs to the Select Group of Referees in England and officiates in the Premier League.\n\n\n== Early and personal life ==\nSalisbury was born in Penwortham in 1985. His father, Graham, is a former referee who had a 21-year career as an EFL referee.\nSalisbury has two children.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSalisbury is a former PE teacher and previously taught at Parklands High School.\n\n\n=== Refereeing ===\nSalisbury was introduced to refereeing by his father, Graham, and began his refereeing career in 2001 in the local leagues in Preston. His father retired on the final day of the 2020–21 season, having officiated 588 Football League games, and Salisbury was his fourth official for the game.\nSalisbury was involved in his first professional game in 2010 as an Assistant Referee in the EFL. Salisbury began refereeing in the Vanarama National League in the 2015–16 season before being promoted to League 2 the following season.\nSalisbury was the reserve assistant referee for the 2016 FA Cup final which took place between Crystal Palace and Manchester United on 21 May 2016.\nOn 29 June 2020, Salisbury refereed the 2020 EFL League Two play-off final in Northampton Town's 4–0 win over Exeter City.\nOn 3 May 2021, Salisbury refereed the 2020 FA Vase final between Consett A.F.C. and Hebburn Town which was a 3–2 win for Hebburn Town.\n\n\n==== Premier League (2021–present) ====\nSalisbury was promoted to the Premier League as a Referee ahead of the 2021–22 season, having previously been an assistant referee in the league. His first Premier League game in charge was Aston Villa's 2–1 win over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park. Both clubs were subsequently charged with misconduct by the FA after both sets of players, unhappy with decisions made by Salisbury in the second half, and failed to conduct themselves in an orderly fashion.\nOn 8 April 2023, Salisbury was the VAR official for a Brighton & Hove Albion's 2–1 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur and failed to intervene after referee Stuart Attwell missed a trip by Pierre-Emile Højbjerg on Kaoru Mitoma in the penalty area when the score was 1–1. PGMOL subsequently offered an apology to Brighton, and Salisbury was dropped from the subsequent Premier League fixtures.\nOn 14 August 2023, Salisbury was the VAR official for a Manchester United's 1–0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers. Manchester United Goalkeeper André Onana collided with Wolves forward Sasa Kalajdzic in the penalty area during stoppage time and the on-field referee, Simon Hooper, did not award the penalty and Salisbury failed to intervene and award the penalty. PGMOL apologised to Wolves Manager Gary O'Neil after the game, and Salisbury along with Hooper and the Assistant VAR were dropped for the subsequent Premier League fixtures.\nOn 27 November 2023, Salisbury refereed Fulham's 3–2 win over Wolves at Craven Cottage, with Salisbury awarding three penalties during the match. Wolves Manager Gary O'Neil said after the game that Salisbury admitted that Fulham's first penalty should have been overturned, with O'Neil also stating that he disputed with Salisbury over whether Carlos Vinícius should have been sent off for a headbutt. The Premier League's Independent Key Match Incidents Panel found that Salisbury had made two errors during the match in awarding the first penalty to Fulham and not sending Vinícius off.\n\n\n== List of refereed domestic finals ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of football referees\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Fire is the upcoming seventh studio album by Canadian heavy metal band Kittie, expected to be released in the summer of 2024 through Sumerian Records. Produced by Nick Raskulinecz at Sienna Studios in Nashville, Tennessee, it will be Kittie's first album in 13 years since the release of I've Failed You (2011), in between which time the band was largely on a hiatus due to rising costs associated with touring and making music, a lack of public interest, and the death of bassist Trish Doan in 2017. After receiving several offers to play shows in late 2021, the band ended their hiatus in January 2022, with bassist Ivy Jenkins returning to their lineup after a decade-long absence. After performing at several festivals, the band were signed to Sumerian and began working on new material.\n\n\n== Background and recording ==\nIn August 2011, Kittie released their sixth album I've Failed You, supporting its release with tours of North America and Australia from August 2011 to May 2012. During the Australia tour, the band parted ways with bassist Ivy Jenkins and Trish Doan returned to the band. Kittie played their final concert in September 2013 before going on a hiatus due to rising costs associated with touring and writing new music, compounded by a lack of public interest in the band. The members of the band subsequently moved on to various other musical projects and jobs, whilst working on a documentary about themselves with director Rob McCallum, Kittie: Origins/Evolutions (2017). Doan died prior to the film's completion in February 2017, and Kittie entered a period of inactivity after performing a show at the documentary's premiere at Rum Runners in London, Ontario, in October 2017. In a 2018 interview, vocalist and guitarist Morgan Lander said that the band had not written any new material in over six years, and in subsequent interviews she and drummer Mercedes Lander expressed reluctance to record a new Kittie album without Doan. In a 2021 interview with Consequence, Morgan said that Doan's death had \"made it really difficult to try to feel like it’s right to do more [music] when she would have wanted to be the one to be there\".\nIn late 2021, amidst a resurgence of nu metal's popularity, Kittie began receiving offers by bookers to play several shows. The band subsequently ended their hiatus in January 2022 with Jenkins rejoining the band on bass. The members of Kittie agreed before the reunions that they would not be a full-time band again, citing the emotional and financial costs involved. After eight months of rehearsals, the band performed their first show in five years on September 8, 2022, at the Blue Ridge Rock Festival in Alton, Virginia. In October 2022, Kittie performed on all three days of the When We Were Young festival in Las Vegas, Nevada. Mercedes said that although she was initially resistant to the idea of reuniting, \"When we stepped onstage, I was, like, 'Oh, yeah, this is how it's supposed to be. This is what I'm supposed to be doing.' This is a fantastic feeling.\"\nKittie said that they had not planned for their reunion to lead to a new album. \"When we first started playing shows back in 2022, we were like, 'I'm sure people will stop caring and then we can go on our merry way.' \", Mercedes told Metal Hammer in 2024. After seeing them perform live, Kittie were signed to Sumerian Records by label head Ash Avildsen. Although Morgan had indicated in 2022 that she had a \"whole phone full of riffs\" prior to the band's first reunion show, Kittie did not begin working on new material together until after they had signed with the label. The band worked on new material over an eight-month period, with its members sending each other ideas via email. During the band's performance at the Sick New World Festival on May 13, 2023, Kittie debuted their first new song in 12 years, \"Vultures\". On November 19, 2023, the band confirmed that they were recording a new album with producer Nick Rasculinecz at Sienna Studios in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nIn various interviews between 2022 and 2023, Morgan hinted at the release of new Kittie music in 2024. On February 14, 2024, Kittie announced that they had signed with Sumerian Records and released the lead single from Fire, \"Eyes Wide Open\". Upon release, Consequence, Exclaim!, Metal Hammer and Revolver listed the song as one of the best of the week. In a Metal Hammer interview published on April 3, 2024, Morgan revealed the album's title and stated that the album would be released in the summer of 2024. The following day, Kittie released \"We Are Shadows\" as the album's second single.\nBetween April and August 2024, Kittie will play at a variety of festivals, including Sick New World, Welcome to Rockville, Sonic Temple, Festival d'été de Québec, and Havoc Fest.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nKittie\n\nMorgan Lander – vocals, guitars\nTara McLeod – guitars\nIvy Jenkins – bass\nMercedes Lander – drums\nProduction\n\nNick Raskulinecz – production\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nLeivers, Dannii (May 2024). \"\"The World is Ready For Us Now\"\".

In November of the same year the Spey was wrecked on the Bahama bank, and young Ward was sent to the Thunder, then employed in surveying the Bahamas. He passed his examination in December 1848, and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant on 2 October 1850. During 1851–3 he was borne on the books of the Fisgard for surveying duties, and in March 1854 was appointed to the Alban steamer, then commanded by Captain Henry Charles Otter, and attached to the fleet in the Baltic, where she did good service in destroying telegraphs and in reconnoitring in the neighbourhood of Sveaborg and at Bomarsund. In 1855–6 he was with Otter in the Firefly, surveying on the coast of Scotland, and in February 1857 was appointed to command the Emperor, a steam-yacht going out as a present to the emperor of Japan. In this yacht he went with Lord Elgin to Yeddo, in August 1858, and, when the vessel had been handed over to the Japanese, returned to Shanghai in the Retribution.\nOn 24 September, he was promoted to command the HMS Actaeon, surveying ship, and in the Actaeon's tender, the Dove gunboat, he accompanied Lord Elgin in his remarkable voyage up the Yang-tse, rendering important assistance in examining the navigable channels of the river. For the next three years he commanded the Actaeon, and in her surveyed the coast of the Gulf of Pe-che-li, including the harbours of Wei-hai-wei and Ta-lien-wan, till then unknown, as also the Yang-tse for two hundred miles above Han-kow. For two years after paying off the Actaeon in the end of 1861, he was employed at the hydrographic office in reducing the work of the survey, and in March 1864 he was appointed to the Rifleman to continue the survey of the China Seas. In 1866 his health gave way, and he was obliged to return to England. He had no further service, and in 1870 accepted the new retirement scheme. On 24 September 1873 he was promoted to be captain on the retired list, and died in London on 20 January 1896, at the age of seventy. He married, in 1852, Mary Hope, daughter of John Bowie of Edinburgh, and left issue.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1899). \"Ward, John (1825-1896)\".

        "content": "Ralph Gosling (1693–1758) was an English topographer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGosling was the youngest son of Charles Gosling, yeoman, of Stubley, in the parish of Dronfield in Derbyshire. He was baptised in the parish church on 15 July 1693. He was probably educated at the Elizabethan grammar school of Dronfield, but appears to have married at a comparatively early age, and to have settled at Sheffield, where he found employment as a writing-master, a schoolmaster, and perhaps also as a surveyor. In the baptismal register of his son John, 7 September 1720, he is described as a writing-master; in the register of John's burial, 26 December 1720, he is described as a schoolmaster; and in his will (proved 7 March 1758), in which he is still described as a schoolmaster, he mentions his surveying instruments.\nIn 1732 he published the earliest known map of Sheffield, which is referred to in Hunter's ‘Hallamshire’ (Gatty's edit. p. 18), where he is also said to have made some collections for the history of Sheffield. Of these no trace remains, and the map, of which another edition appears to have been published in 1736 (Gatty, Sheffield Past and Present, p. 121), is very scarce. There is no copy of either edition in the British Museum. At his death in 1758 he seems to have been in comfortable circumstances, a schedule of money owing to him amounting to 1,205l. His wife Mary had died previously in February 1755. Besides a daughter, Mary, whose name has no place in his will, and who presumably died before him, he had a son and a daughter who both died in infancy. Joseph Hunte, the historian of Hallamshire, speaks of Jane Gosling, the wife of Gosling's grandson, who eked out her husband's narrow means by keeping a dame's school, which he himself attended when four years old (Add. MS. 24440, f. 33). It is, however, almost certain that Gosling had no other children than those mentioned above, and that the husband of Jane Gosling was his grand-nephew. Besides keeping the school, Jane was the author of ‘Moral Essays and Reflections’ (Sheffield, 1789), and of ‘Ashdale Village,’ a tale of which only the first two volumes were published. She died in 1804. Her name does not appear in the Catalogue of the British Museum.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1890). \"Gosling, Ralph\".

        "content": "James Ralfe (fl. 1820–1829) was a British writer on naval history.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nRalfe was the author of The Naval Chronology of Great Britain; an Historical Account of Naval and Maritime Events from the commencement of the War in 1803 to the end of the Year 1816 (3 vols. 8vo, London, 1820), a useful compilation, intended as a continuation of the Naval Chronology of Captain Isaac Schomberg, but on a more extended scale. It appears to have been issued in parts, the date on the title-page being that of the completion of the work. He afterwards wrote The Naval Biography of Great Britain, consisting of Historical Memoirs of those Officers of the British Navy who distinguished themselves during the reign of his Majesty George III, (4 vols. 4to, London, 1828). This was certainly published in parts, as appears from the reprint of the Memoir of Admiral Charles Stirling (12mo, 1826), and an appendix to the Memoir of Sir James Athol Wood, containing a criticism on it by Sir Charles Brisbane, dated 29 December 1827. The appendix also contains an account of the battle of Navarino, and in the following year, 1829, Ralfe issued a pamphlet in justification of Sir Edward Codrington's conduct. The matter of the several memoirs in the Naval Biography seems to have been for the most part contributed by the subjects of them, and may be accepted as correct as to facts. The inferences are less certain, and the style is stilted and verbose to an extreme degree. As a pecuniary venture, it is said to have been unsuccessful, and in 1829 an attempt was made by some of the senior officers of the navy to raise a fund for the author's benefit, the subscriptions to be paid to his publishers, Messrs. Whitmore & Fenn, 6 Charing Cross (advertisement at the end of the Navarino pamphlet).\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1896). \"Ralfe, James\".

The earliest work which bears his name is ‘The Arte of Navigation,’ translated from the Spanish by Richard Eden in 1561, and now ‘corrected and augmented with a Regiment or Table of Declination and divers other necessary tables and rules of common navigation … by J. T.,’ 4to, 1596. The preface is signed in full ‘John Tap,’ and the work has the imprint of ‘Edw. Allde,’ ‘to be sold by Hugh Astley, dwelling at Saint Magnus Corner.’ In 1602 he brought out ‘The Seaman's Kalender, or an Ephemerides of the Sun, Moone, and certaine of the most notable fixed Starres. … The Tables being for the most part calculated from the yeere 1601 to the yeare 1624 by I. T.;’ and this, printed also by E. Allde, for John Tapp, ‘was to be sold at his shop on Tower Hill, neere the Bulwark Gate.’ A third book is a ‘Treatise on Arithmatic,’ which was represented in the British Museum by a second and posthumous edition, brought out in 1658 by P. Ray, gent., under the title of ‘Tap's Arithmetick, or the Path-way to the Knowledge of the Ground of Arts,’ and dedicated to Maurice Thomson, governor of the East India Company, as the former edition had been to Sir Thomas Smythe ‘The Arte of Navigation’ went into a third edition in 1615, when the author was still alive and had succeeded Astley in the shop at Saint Magnus Corner.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1898). \"Tapp, John\".

Her work includes collaborations with artists such as Belafonte Sensacional, and she is part of avant-garde music collective Amor Muere.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nBorn in Guatemala, and raised in a Pentecostalist family, Mabe was classically trained in cello (an early inspiration being a Gyorgy Ligeti brought home by her father) and began creating her own music as a teenager, with the cello she uses now being a gift from her school. \nIn 2015, a Goethe Institute residency took her to Mexico to work on her music. Through this residency she performed with more musicians such as established artists Gudrun Gut and Julian Bonequi, and got involved in the Mexico City improvisational music scene. She met future members of Amore Muere and her partner Hector Tosta, then of La Vida Bohème.\nIn 2019 Fratti produced her first album, Pies Sobre La Tierra, citing W.G Sebald's The Rings of Saturn as inspiration. This was followed up by Será Que Ahora Podremos Entendernos in 2021, collaborating for album with composer Claire Rousay and the experimenal band Tajak, and the album being described as \"referending Arthur Russell\". Fratti's subsequent 2022 album Se Ve Desde Aquí has been referred to as \"mind blowing\" by fellow experimental artist Oneohtrix Point Never.\nShe went on to collaborate with partner Hector Tosta as Titanic in 2023, producing Vidrio, an album described as \"somewhere between jazz and chamber pop\".\nIn 2023 Amor Muere released A time to love, a time to die. Fratti had formed this musical collective with artists Concepción Huerta, Gibrana Cervantes and Camille Mandoki, creating works over a period of years.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nSolo\n\nPies Sobre La Tierra (2019)\nSerá Que Ahora Podremos Entendernos (2021)\nSe Ve Desde Aquí (2022)\nTitanic \n\nVidrio (2023)\nAmore Muere\n\nA time to love, a time to die (2023)\nOther collaborations\n\nMabe Fratti & Concepción Huerta – Estática (2022)\nGudrun Gut + Mabe Fratti – Let's Talk About The Weather (2021)\nBelafonte Sensacional – Soy piedra (2019)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mungo Murray (died 19 October 1770) was a British writer on shipbuilding.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMurray published in 1754 a 'Treatise on Shipbuilding and Navigation,' 4to. On the title-page he describes himself as 'Shipwright in his Majesty's yard, Deptford;' and in an advertisement it is stated that in the evenings, from six to eight, except Wednesdays and Saturdays, he taught 'the several branches of mathematics treated of in the book,' and sold mathematical instruments. In May 1758 he was appointed to the Magnanime, with Lord Howe, in the rating of midshipman, but in reality, it would seem, as a teacher of mathematics and navigation ; and on 9 January 1760 he received a warrant as schoolmaster. In June 1762 he was turned over, with Howe, to the Princess Amelia, which was paid oft at the peace (Pay-book of Magnanime and Princess Amelia). During his service in the Magnanime, which embraced the date of the battle of Quiberon Bay, he published 'The Rudiments of Navigation . . . compiled for the use of the Young Gentlemen on board the Magnanime,' 1760, 8vo (there was a copy in the library of the Royal Society). In 1764 he wrote a short note on an eclipse of the sun, which was printed in the 'Philosophical Transactions' (liv. 171). In 1765 he issued a new and enlarged edition of his 'Treatise on Shipbuilding,' and at some later date 'Four Prints (with references and explanations), exhibiting the different Views of a Sixty-gun Ship.' The prints, but not the explanations, were in the British Museum. These last were in the library of the Royal United Service Institution. He describes himself on the title-page as then carpenter of the Weymouth. He also published 'Forty Plates of Elevations, Sections, and Plans of different Vessels.' The copy in the British Museum wants the title-page. He died 19 October 1770. When in the Magnanime his wages were paid to Christian Murray, presumably his wife.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1894). \"Murray, Mungo\".

        "content": "Sir William Mitchell (1811 – 1 May 1878) was an English maritime writer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMitchell was the son of John Mitchell of Modbury in Devon. He was born at Modbury in 1811. At an early age he came to London as a journalist, was for some time on the 'True Sun,' and from 1836 was chief proprietor and editor of the 'Shipping and Mercantile Gazette,' a daily paper which he established, and which at once took the high position it has since maintained. In 1840 he began to urge the importance, and indeed the necessity, of compulsory examinations for officers of merchant ships; and it was mainly in consequence of his action that the Mercantile Marine Act of 1850 was passed (13 & 14 Vict. cap. 93). In 1857 he was called on to advise with the registrar-general of seamen in the preparation of the measure for the royal naval reserve, which eventually took form in the act of 1859 'for the Establishment of a Reserve Volunteer Force of Seamen, and for the Government of the same' (22 & 23 Vict. cap. 40). He succeeded in introducing an international code of signals, which was gradually adopted by every maritime country, and in establishing signal stations for reporting the movements of all ships using the international code. In reward for his public services he was knighted in 1867, and in 1869 was nominated by the king of Sweden a knight commander of the order of St. Olaf. He edited ' A Review of the Merchant Shipping Bill, being a Series of Leading Articles . . . from the \" Shipping and Mercantile Gazette,\"' 1869, 8vo, and < Maritime Notes and Queries, a Record of Shipping Law and 1873–6, 4to. He died at Strode, near Ivybridge, Devonshire, on 1 May 1878. He married in 1835 Caroline, eldest daughter of Richard Andrews of Modbury.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1894). \"Mitchell, William (1811-1878)\".

        "content": "Kell Brook vs. Frankie Gavin, billed as Rule Britannia, was a professional boxing match contested on 30 May 2015, for the IBF Welterweight championship.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter making the first defence of his IBF welterweight belt against Jo Jo Dan and after being unable to attract Amir Khan, Kell Brook agreed to face former British and Commonwealth champion, Frankie Gavin.\nThis was the first all British World Welterweight title bout for more than 100 years, since Matt Wells scored an 20-round decision victory over Tom McCormick at Sydney Stadium in 1914.\n\n\n== The fights ==\n\n\n=== Undercard ===\nDave Ryan survived two knockdowns before scoring a 9th-round TKO in his second bout with John Wayne Hibbert. Scott Cardle won the British lightweight title after a unanimous points decision over Craig Evans, Nick Blackwell upset John Ryder to win the British middleweight title and former world champion Nathan Cleverly scored a 24-second knockout of journeyman Tomas Man.\n\n\n=== Gradovich vs Selby ===\nIn the first of three world title bouts, unbeaten IBF featherweight champion Evgeny Gradovich faced Lee Selby. Selby consistently outboxed Gradovich throughout the bout, before a clash of heads left Gradovich cut by the right eye in the seventh. During the next round referee Deon Dwarte called for the ringside doctor to inspect the eye and the bout was quickly waved off. As the clash was accidental, the bout went to the scorecard who awarded Selby victory by unanimous technical decision with scores 79–73, 80-72 and 79–73.\nSelby would dedicate the victory to his late brother Michael.\n\n\n=== Linares vs Mitchell ===\nSelby's win was followed by WBC lightweight champion Jorge Linares making the first defence of his belt against Kevin Mitchell, who was having his third shot at a world title.\nLinares was dropped in the fifth round with a right-left combination. By the eight Mitchell was badly cut above the left eye which had closed up. Mitchell was dropped in the tenth with a right hand, he beat the count but the referee stopped the bout. The cut was due to a clash of heads in round four, which also opened a cut on the side of Linares' head. At the time of stoppage, Mitchell was ahead on two of the judges scorecards at 82–88 and 84–86. The third judge had it even at 85–85.\n\n\n=== Joshua vs Johnson ===\nIn the chief support, 2012 Olympic gold medalist Anthony Joshua faced the durable former world title challenger Kevin Johnson. Joshua had stopped all 12 of his previous opponents within 3 rounds, while Johnson was on a run of just 1 win in his last 6 bouts, but this included going the distance with the likes of Tyson Fury and Derek Chisora.\nJoshua would dominate Johnson dropping him through the ropes in the first round. Johnson beat the count but a sustained barrage in the second round prompted the referee to wave the bout off. This was marked the first time Johnson had ever been stopped.\nSteve Bunce, commentating for BBC Radio 5 Live said in the aftermath: \"We've seen the future and the future is Anthony Joshua, if we were watching this in the early hours of the morning from the United States we'd be getting very excited. I don't want the post mortem to say Johnson was too old and too fat. I thought he would go the distance. The look on Johnson's face was one of shock.\"\n\n\n=== Main Event ===\nGavin used his awkward style to cause Brook some issues in the opening rounds, especially with a couple of sharp right-hand counters in the fourth, although Brook was largely in control of the action. However Brook's hard shots began taking their toll and by the fifth the challenger's face was beginning to mark up. Towards the end of the sixth round, Brook landed right hand followed by a pair of uppercuts which prompted the referee stepped in to end the fight.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nPlans for a summer or autumn bout with Khan didn't come together and Brook return to the ring in March 2016 against Kevin Bizier.\n\n\n== Undercard ==\nConfirmed bouts:\n\n\n== Broadcasting ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hans Peter Prior (25 February 1866 - 27 September 1936) was a Danish industrialist who founded NKT A/S.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nPrior was born on 25 February 1866 in Copenhagen, the son of shipbuilding engineer  Johannes Andreas Prior (1840–1905) and Fernanda Frederikke Louise Jacobine Ekman (1843–93). His paternal grandfather was DFDS-founder Hans Peter Prior (1813–1875). The family lived in the  Prior House on Bredgade in  Copenhagen. He had four younger brothers and two younger sisters. His brothers were bank manager Ferdinand Prior, business executive Viggo Prior, lawyer Otto Prior and architect Alexis Prior.\nPrior attended Borgerdyd School and later received a technical education in C. P. Jürgensens Mekaniske Etablissement which was later supplemented with a couple of years of theoretical studies. In 1888, he traveled to the US where he worked for some time at the Edison Machine Works.\n\n\n== Career ==\nUpon his return to Copenhagen in 1891, Prior started a small-scale production of cables and electrical wires in a basement at Store Kannikestræde 14. In 1893, he inaugurated a new factory at Ryesgade 105. The name  of the firm was changed to Nordisk Kabelfabrik. On 21 February 1898, it was merged with another enterprise as Aktieselskabet Nordiske Kabel- og Traadfabriker with Prior as the merger's first managing director.\nIn 1908–12, Prior served as president of the Danish Electro-Technical Association (Elektroteknisk Forening). In 1910, he became president of Industriforeningen. In the same year, when the Danish Industry Council (Industrirådet) was established, Prior was appointed as its first president. For health reasons, he gave up the chairmanship as early as 1911, and he  was instead replaced by Alexander Foss. During the First World War, in 1914–18, Prior  was instrumental in promoting the council's trade policy tasks. He was a member of the England committee and signed the first of the council's agreements with the belligerent powers as an envoy for the Industrial Council in London in 1915. Likewise, during the world war, he held a number of chairmanships in the special committees that were set up to distribute the imported goods among the individual industrial enterprises, and after the establishment of the German submarine blockade, he traveled with director Christian Cold to America to obtain an arrangement with the United Nations.\nIn January 1920, when decease forced Foss to retire, Prior returned to the post as president of the Industry Council. In April 1920, he was appointed as Minister of Trade in the interin Cabinet of M. P. Friis.\nThe collapse of Landmandsbanken in 1922 and the series of investigations that arose as a result of this, resulted in Prior being sentenced to three months in prison.\nWhile he was developing Nordiske Kabel- og Traadfabriker, Prior had met with a lot of understanding and support from the Landmandsbanken and Isak Gluckstadt. Over the years, he had  become more and more closely connected to the bank and joined not only its bank council, but also the board of a number of companies within the bank's interest spere, icnluding Det Transatlantiske Kompagni, Nordiske Metalvarefabrikker, Forenede Automobilfabrikker and Nielsen & Winther. In 1918, together with Emil Glückstadt and Ove Ringberg, he had formed a consortium to buy shares in Nordisk Kabel- og Traad. The purpose was to protect the company against a group of speculators, but when the consortium made large losses, these were transferred to the company and Landmandsbanken in various ways. Prior was sentenced to 120 days in prison for complicity in these transactions by the Supreme Court (the high court had merely given him a fine of DKK 800 for violating the Danish Companies Act). As a result of the Landmandsbank case, Prior resigned in 1923 as managing director of Nordisk Kabel- og Traad, just as he also had to give up his post as chairman of the Industrial Council.\nAfter serving his sentence, in 1925 Prior established the Danish Galosche- and Gummifabrik (now Codan Rubber) ub Køge, which he managed until 1931. Until his death, he was a member of the board of the Joint Representation of Danish Industry and Crafts as well as of the for Technological Institute and Børnehjemmet Fanmark. He also remained a member of the Danish electrotechnical committee.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOn 22 September 1893 in Kristiania, Prior married to Margarethe Cathrine Bergh (1866–1927). She was a daughter of Supreme Court attorney Johannes Bergh (1837–1906) and Anna Johanne (Hanne) Borchgrevink (1838–1906). After the death of his first wife, on 27 Kanuary 1929 in Vrejlev, he was married to Inger Adelhaid Kaas (1894–1971). She had previously been married to Hans Kaj Niels Rand (1891–1944). She was the daughter of landowner and hotel owner Niels Adolph Christoph K. (1868–1936) and Sarah Henriette adopt. Heiberg (1853-).\nOrior died in Gellerup on 27 September 1936. He is buried at Copenhagen's Western Cemetery.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nIn 1916, Prior was created a Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog. In 1920, he was awarded the Cross of Gonour.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHans Peter Prior at geni.com",

        "content": "\"Piazza Grande\" ('Grand Square') is a 1972 song composed by Lucio Dalla, Ron, Gianfranco Baldazzi and Sergio Bardotti, arranged by Ruggero Cini and performed by Lucio Dalla. The song ranked eighth at the 22nd edition of the Sanremo Music Festival.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe song was composed by Dalla and Ron with the working title \"America\", and it was initially supposed to tell the story of the 1620 Mayflower voyage. After various attempts of lyricists Bardotti and Baldazzi to suit the projected theme to the music, during a promotional tour in the US, in Manhattan, Baldazzi eventually changed the topic of the song into the story of a homeless man who prefers his freedom to comfort. \nThe title of the song is a reference to Piazza Cavour in Bologna, close to Dalla's birth house. The RCA label lobbied to change it into a more well known \"Canal Grande\", with Dalla resisting to its requests. Once heard the song, his RCA colleague Gianni Morandi repeatedly asked Dalla to be the one to bring the song to the Sanremo Festival, eventually being turned down.\nThe song premiered at the Sanremo Music Festival 1972, with Dalla being accompanied by Ron as guitarist. In spite of being one of the favorites it only ranked eighth, even if it turned to be a commercial success and a long seller.\nArtists who recorded cover versions of the song include Fiorella Mannoia, Gianni Morandi, Albano Carrisi, Tosca & Sílvia Pérez Cruz, Fiorello, Tomislav Ivčić, Franck Pourcel, Pierdavide Carone.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPiazza Grande at Discogs (list of releases)",

        "content": "Richard Walter (1716? – 10 March 1785) was a British Royal Navy chaplain.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWalter was the son of Arthur Walter, merchant in London.  He was admitted a member of Sidney-Sussex College, Cambridge, on 3 July 1735, 'aged 18.' He graduated B.A. in 1738, was elected to a fellowship, ordained, and in 1740 was appointed chaplain of his majesty's ship Centurion, then fitting out for her celebrated voyage round the world, under the command of Commodore George Anson. As the Centurion sailed in September 1740, Walter cannot have been ordained priest later than Trinity Sunday 1740, which throws the date of his birth back to May 1716 at the latest. His age at matriculation must have been erroneously entered by at least a year. Walter continued in the Centurion, having often with the other officers, though 'a puny, weakly man, pale, and of a low stature,' to assist in the actual working of the ship, till her arrival at Macao in November 1742. In December, an opportunity occurring, he obtained the commodore's leave, and returned to England in one of the East India Company's ships. He took his M.A. degree in 1744, and in March 1745 was appointed chaplain of Portsmouth dockyard, a post which he held till his death on 10 March 1785. He was buried at Great Staughton, Huntingdon, where he owned some property, though it does not appear that he had ever resided there. On 5 May 1748 he married, in Gray's Inn Chapel, Jane Saberthwaite of St. Margaret's, Lothbury, and left issue a son and daughter, whose descendants survive. The son's great-grandson, the Rev. E. L. H. Tew, owned a portrait of his ancestor. The daughter's son was Sir Henry Prescott. In 1748 Walter published 'A Voyage round the World in the years 1740-1-2-3-4, by George Anson, esq., now Lord Anson . . . compiled from his papers and materials by Richard Walter, Chaplain of His Majesty s ship the Centurion in that Expedition,' 4to. The book had been anxiously looked for, and almost immediately ran through several editions; four were issued in 1748. It has been since reprinted very many times in its entirety or in abridgments, and is still esteemed as the story of a remarkable voyage extremely well told. In 1761 a statement was published by Dr. James Wilson, in editing the 'Mathematical Tracts' of Benjamin Robins, to the effect that the real author of the book was Robins, Walter having contributed but a bare skeleton of matter from journals and logs, in a form quite unsuitable for publication. Upon this assertion being repeated in the 'Biographia Britannica' (1789), Walter's widow wrote to John Walter, bookseller at Charing Cross, and 'a relation to the deceased,' positively denying its truth [see under Walter, John, 1739-1812]. 'During the time of Mr. Walter's writing that voyage,' she said, 'he visited me almost daily previous to our marriage, and I have frequently heard him say how closely he had been engaged in writing for some hours to prepare for his constant attendance upon Lord Anson, at six every morning, for his approbation,as his lordship overlooked every sheet that was written. At some of those meetings Mr. Robins assisted, as he was consulted in the disposition of the drawings; and I also know that Mr. Robins left England—for he was sent to Bergen-op-Zoom—some months before the publication of the book; and I have frequently seen Mr. Walter correct the proof-sheets for the printer' (Notes and Queries, 8th ser. ii. 86). Independently of this, the book is unquestionably the work of a man familiar with the daily life on board a ship of war, and that Robins was not. Robins may have taken a greater or less part in the work of revision, but his definitely ascertained share in the book is confined to the discussion of the nautical observations which occupy the second volume.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1899). \"Walter, Richard\".

        "content": "Mountain soap (Latin: Argilla saponiformis, German: Bergseife, French: Savon de montagne),: 203 , rock-soap or bolus: 34  — a partially outdated trivial name for a large group of clay minerals similar in properties from the group of hydrous layered aluminum silicates with variable composition. Minerals from the mountain soap group contain primarily silicates (44-46%), alumina (17-26%), iron oxides (6-10%) and water (13-25%). The mountain soap group included at different times up to two dozen mineral species and varieties. In different cases, this name could mean different minerals, most often halloysite (from the proper name), saponite (soapstone),: 187  bentonite or montmorillonite (from the French: Montmorillon, toponym). The last mineral is a large group, each of which could be called mountain soap. All these minerals received their common colloquial name, which gradually penetrated into mineralogy, for their ability to lather and serve as a detergent for various purposes.\nMountain soap has some common properties that are characteristic of all minerals included in the group. All of them have very low hardness (from 1 to 2 on the Mohs scale) and are a typical weathering product of aluminosilicates. In the form of its main component (bentonite, which is formed during the weathering of volcanic rocks — tuffs and ash), mountain soap is one of the main minerals in many types of soils, and it is also found in many sedimentary rocks. Thanks to its layered “batch” structure, mountain soap has the ability to absorb water, swell strongly and has pronounced sorption properties.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name “mountain soap” is not so much a metaphor, which is quite often found in mineralogy, as a simple statement of the soapy properties of the mineral, as well as the systematic use that it has had for thousands of years. This mineral is named mountain soap, on account of its greasiness, sectility, and softness.: 79  On the one hand, this type of clay received its trivial name from its property of softening in water and forming with it a viscous and greasy substance to the touch, similar to thickly diluted soap.: 95  On the other hand, for a very long time, the population that had access to deposits of such clays systematically used it as a detergent for various purposes: from waulking cloth, canvas and wool to washing hands, face and hair in the bathhouse. From the combination of two factors inherent in all these varieties, other synonymous names also follow under which washing clays are found. In the literature of the 18th and 19th centuries, mountain soap can be found under the names: soapy earth, soapy clay, soapstone or bolus.\nThe conventional scientific use of the collective term “mountain soap” generally ended by the last quarter of the 19th century, giving way to individual names of the minerals included in this conventional group. Currently, the term is considered completely outdated and does not appear as such even in the latest mineralogical dictionaries.: 239, 531 \n\n\n== Properties ==\nMountain soap has the same properties as one of its main varieties: bentonite or montmorillonite. This is a typical clay mineral belonging to the subclass of layered silicates, due to its structure it has the ability to swell strongly. In addition, mountain soap has pronounced sorption properties. The modern use of bentonites in industrial production, construction and even as a food additive is based on their high thermal stability, binding ability, as well as catalytic and adsorption activity.\nOld authors of the 18th-19th centuries, describing the properties of mountain soap, unanimously note that it is opaque, not sticky, convenient for writing, and also soft when wetted, lathers well and sticks strongly to the tongue. It feels greasy and light. In composition (according to Buchholz's analysis) it contains 44% silica, 26.5% alumina, about 20.5% water, 8% iron oxides and 0.5-1% calcium compounds (lime).: 377–378  Naturally, the results of chemical analysis relate exclusively to the specific variety on which laboratory operations were carried out. In all other cases, both the percentage composition of the substances that make up the clay and the set of impurities may differ significantly from the proposed ratio. Nevertheless, this analysis is quite indicative in general for that mineral group that can be described as “mountain soaps”.\nBeing in damp soil or being moistened, mountain soap becomes completely soft and similar to butter, but when it dries in dry weather in the air or when heated, it hardens. Chemical stability and even some inertness of mountain soap are also noted; even in strong acids, for example, sulfuric, hydrochloric or nitric, no visible change or any other signs of a chemical reaction occur with it.: 157 \n\nThe authors differ significantly more regarding the color of the clays. If Johann Gottgelf von Waldheim unequivocally states that mountain soap “has a light pitch-black color”,: 377  Pavel Goryaninov practically confirm his opinion, assuring that it is “black-brown in color”,: 264  and Robert Jameson confirms this information,: 80  however then other authors are much less categorical. The Mining Journal for 1926 writes that “this soap has different colors, but more greenish and yellow”,: 157  and Grigory Spassky in the Mining Dictionary of 1843 summarizes: “its color is generally white, turning into dark brown, bluish and yellowish”.: 95 \nIt is clear that the specific characteristics of mountain soap are associated, first of all, with the breadth of coverage of regional forms and varieties that a particular author included in his review. In particular, Spassky separately mentions that the external properties of mountain soap, used in the Kazan and Irkutsk governorates, and especially in the Crimea under the name kil, are generally similar to those described here, however, the chemical composition of each of these differences has not yet been precisely determined.: 95 \nPavel Ogorodnikov writes about exactly the same thing in his memoir “Essays on Persia”, of course, without mentioning the exact names and chemical terms. Talking about his travels through Northern Iran, he notices that different types of fatty clay, which replaces soap for the poor population when washing clothes, are found in abundance in all the nearby mountains. For example, grayish clay, sold at the local market for 1,80 rub. and more expensive per halvar, mined mainly between the villages of Tash and Mujen, and cheaper, yellowish (90 kopecks per halvar) — in the surrounding mountains of the village of Taal-Saab-abad. Asterabad residents wash their clothes mainly with Gilaser clay, which is abundant in the Asterabad mountains. In addition, the Shahrud people also use Semnon clay, which comes from the city of Semnon, which lies on the way from Shahrud to Tehran. This particularly expensive and probably high quality clay sells for 9 rub. for halvar, used exclusively by women when washing their hair in the bathhouse.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nMountain (disambiguation)\nSoap (disambiguation)\nKaolinite\nClay",

        "content": "The Official Labour Movement (OLM) was an Australian political party that was active in the 1950s. It was formed as a result of a split from the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party (ALP).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe party was formed in Sydney on 23 August 1953 by Fairfield alderman Horace Hancock, with 70 people − including alderman William Leonard Wolfenden, a former mayor of Fairfield − joining the party at its first meeting. Its provisional name was the Progressive Labor Party, which was the same name as a Victorian party that had also split from the ALP. The meeting was attended by Hartley MP Jim Chalmers, who had resigned from Labor prior to the state election in February 1953.\nHancock, along with six other people, resigned from the ALP after forming the new party, but the ALP Central Executive refused to accept their resignations. They were eventually expelled on 4 September 1953.\nThe party officially changed its name to the Official Labour Movement on 13 September 1953.\nAt the local government elections in December 1953, the OLM contested the three-member Yennora Ward and won two seats, with Hancock and Wolfenden both re-elected.\nHancock contested the 1954 federal election in the division of Reid, going up against ALP MP Charles Morgan. He was unsuccessful, winning 6.4% of the primary vote while Morgan was re-elected.\nThe OLM remained active for several months after the election, but faded away in 1955.\n\n\n== References ==",

He began his rugby career at Section Paloise, later becoming the attack and transition coach for the club after retiring as a player.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Playing career ===\n\n\n==== Youth career ====\nLanne-Petit started playing rugby at Section Paloise from the age of seven to eighteen. As a cadet, he played for the Béarn selection alongside Camille Lopez and was part of the Top 100 national cadet.\nHe then joined the junior ranks of Stade Montois, winning the Junior Championship in 2008, and later moved to Castres Olympique, winning the Reichel Championship in 2009.\n\n\n==== Pro D2 ====\nLanne-Petit began his professional career with Tarbes Pyrénées Rugby in Pro D2. After two years, he underwent hip surgeries which interrupted his career. He later played for CA Lannemezan and US Morlaàs in the lower divisions.\nIn 2013, he joined USON Nevers in Fédérale 1, followed by a stint at Sporting Nazairien, before returning to US Morlaàs.\nHis professional career ended abruptly due to a liquidation of Sporting Nazairien, leading him to unemployment and eventually back to US Morlaàs.\n\n\n=== Coaching career ===\n\n\n==== Section Paloise ====\nAfter finding himself unemployed at the age of 28, Lanne-Petit pursued a coaching career. He approached Simon Mannix, then general manager of his hometown club, Section Paloise, who offered him a voluntary coaching role to learn the trade. He decided to pursue coaching over a playing contract with Tarbes. He specialized in technical skills development, particularly with kickers and scrum-halves, bringing innovative perspectives to training sessions. In February 2018, Mannix extended his contract, making him the youngest assistant coach in Top 14. He briefly led the first team after the departure of Mannix and his assistants Nicolas Godignon and Frédéric Manca.\nAs an assistant under Sébastien Piqueronies, Lanne-Petit focused on maximizing the offensive potential of talented young French players, including those who won the 2023 World Rugby U20 Championship.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nLanne-Petit received a five-week suspension for misconduct during Section Paloise's EPCR Challenge Cup loss to the Cheetahs.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nWinner of the Crabos Championship in 2008 with Stade montois.\nWinner of the Reichel Championship in 2009 with Castres Olympique.\n\n\n== References ==",

As a child he wanted to be a scientist, but eventually decided to pursue art. He studied sculpture at the School of Applied Arts in Bratislava and later painting at the Academy of Fine Arts and Design in Bratislava. \n\nFollowing graduation, Dúbravský gained notability by organizing art exhibitions at unusual places such as a butcher's shop or abandoned construction sites. In 2011 and 2012, he was among the winners of the young artist competition organized by the foundation of the Všeobecná úverová banka. Dúbravský's art has been exhibited in Germany, Czechia, New York and at various venues in his native Slovakia, including the Slovak National Gallery. \nIn December 2023, the Minister of Culture of Slovakia Martina Šimkovičová criticized an exhibition of Dúbravský's paintings hold at the art gallery of the Radio and Television of Slovakia due to alleged obscenity and promotion of LGBT lifestyle. Her statement was widely condemned by the art community in Slovakia. \n\n\n== Personal life ==\nDúbravský came out as gay at the age of 16. Since 2011, he has been in a relationship with the movie director and actor Peter Bebjak. \nHe resides in the village of Rastislavice and in New York City.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPaintings by Dúbravský on the web of the Slovak National Gallery",

        "content": "The 2024 Milton Keynes City Council election is scheduled to be held on Thursday 2 May 2024, alongside the other local elections in the United Kingdom being held on the same day. One-third of the 57 members of Milton Keynes City Council in Buckinghamshire will be elected.\n\n\n== Background ==\nMilton Keynes was created as a unitary authority in 1997. Labour controlled the council from its creation until 2000, with the Liberal Democrats winning the council from no overall control in 2002. The Liberal Democrats lost their majority in 2006, and no party has formed a majority since. \nThe Conservatives became the largest party on the council in 2011, but were overtaken by Labour in 2014. The Conservatives were again the largest group in 2018, with Labour overtaking them in 2019. The Conservatives formed the largest group from 2021 to 2023; in that election, Labour gained 5 seats to become the largest group on the council, the Conservatives lost 6, and the Liberal Democrats gained 1. Labour and the Liberal Democrats formed a majority coalition following the election.\nThe seats up for election in 2024 were last contested in 2021; because of the delay of all local elections due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the seats are up for election after 3 years rather than the usual 4. In that election, the Conservatives won 11 seats (up 6) with 42.0% of the vote, Labour won 7 (down 4) with 34.0%, and the Liberal Democrats won 3 (down 2) with 16.2%.\n\n\n== Previous council composition ==\n\nChanges:\n\nJune 2023: Joe Hearnshaw and James Lancaster join Labour from Conservatives\nAugust 2023: Scot Balazs (Conservative) resigns; by-election held September 2023\nSeptember 2023: Tony Oyakhire (Liberal Democrats) wins by-election from Conservatives\nJanuary 2024: Brigid McBride (Labour) resigns; by-election held February 2024\nFebruary 2024: Leo Montague (Labour) wins by-election\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) has been the official currency of Zimbabwe since 8 April 2024, backed by US$575 million worth of hard assets: foreign currencies, gold, and other precious metals. It replaced the Zimbabwean dollar, which suffered from rapid depreciation, with the official exchange rate surpassing 30,000 Zimbabwean dollars per U.S. dollar on 5 April 2024, whilst the parallel market rate reached 40,000 per U.S. dollar. Annual inflation in Zimbabwe hit 55.3% in March 2024.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe ZiG currency was announced on 5 April 2024, taking the name from ZiG digital tokens, which are now available as GBDT. The ZiG is Zimbabwe's sixth attempt since 2008 at creating a new currency that will make it independent of the US dollar.Zimbabwe has a multi-currency system, introduced in 2009 after the hyperinflation of the Zimbabwean dollar. In addition to the ZiG, foreign currencies are also legal tender. As of March 2024, 80% of all transactions in Zimbabwe were made in US dollars. The government and the central bank expect the use of ZiG to gradually increase in the country. Companies are required to pay 50% of their quarterly taxes in ZiG.\n\n\n== Features ==\nThe Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe over the weekend of 6 April to 7 April 2024 released the currency features.\n\n\n== Denominations ==\n\n\n=== Banknotes ===\nBanknotes of Zimbabwe Gold will be introduced in eight denominations: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 ZiG. They will begin circulating on 30 April 2024.The ZiG notes are made from cotton paper, have the Zimbabwe Bird as their watermark and are all equal in size, measuring 155 mm × 65 mm (6.1 in × 2.6 in).\n\n\n=== Coins ===\nThe coins will come in two forms, Half ZiG and Quarter ZiG. They will be introduced on 30 April 2024, along with the banknotes.\n\n\n== Subdivisions ==\nThe ZiG will not have a subdivision - and will be the only currency other than the Vanuatuan vatu where this is the case.\n\n\n== Conversions ==\n\n\n=== Exchange rates ===\nThe Zimbabwean dollar (ZWL) lost about 32% value on interbank in a two-day trading, moving from 22,950 to 33,903 per U.S. dollar. The conversion to ZiG, will be based on gold price and swap rate. On a press release dated 6 April 2024, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe announced that ZWL would be converted to ZiG at an exchange rate of 2498.7242 ZWL for one ZiG. Zimbabweans were given 21 days to convert their cash into ZiG.The ZiG started trading on 8 April 2024 with an exchange rate of 13.56 ZiG per US dollar and was subsequently allowed to freely float.\n\n\n=== Zimswitch and banks ===\nAll banks and financial institutions were instructed to convert all ZWL balances, obligations and accounts to the new currency, ZiG.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGBDT\nZimbabwean dollar\nMosi-oa-Tunya\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The coronation of James II and VII, and his wife Mary of Modena, as King and Queen of England, Scotland and Ireland was held on 23 April 1685 at Westminster Abbey. James and Mary were the last British monarchs to be Catholics, despite the Protestant Church of England being the established church. Accordingly, the service was reordered to omit the Anglican Communion Service, the only time that a British coronation has been conducted without one. The truncated text of the coronation liturgy which was prepared for the service provided the model for future coronations into the 20th century. James was also the first monarch since the Union of the Crowns not to have a coronation in Scotland, and the first English monarch since the 14th century not to plan a royal entry procession through London, these and other innovations set long-standing precedents for future British coronations.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nJames's predecessor and elder brother, King Charles II, had come to the throne in the 1660 Stuart Restoration, which followed the English Civil Wars, the execution of Charles I and the five year republic known as the The Protectorate. Charles II had a difficult relationship with the Parliament of England over religious policy. Charles supported the High Church wing of the Church of England which inclined towards Catholic traditions, while many in parliament, calling themselves \"the Country Party\" (later known as Whigs), were Protestant-minded and strongly anti-Catholic. In 1673, parliament passed the Test Act 1673, which required anyone holding public office to take an oath afirning their adherence to Protestantism. James, then Duke of York, refused to take the oath, which publicly revealed the fact that James had secretly converted to Catholicism. This provoked the Exclusion Crisis, when parliament attempted to pass bills that would exclude James from the throne, because they feared that a Catholic monarch, like Louis XIV of France, would rule as an autocrat and restrict Protestant freedom of worship. The perceived threat was amplified by a fictitious conspiracy theory called the Popish Plot. However, the king's supporters in the House of Lords, known as the Tories, were able to block the exclusion bills and in 1681, Charles prorogued parliament and never called another one. By 1684, Charles's parliamentary opponents were either exiled in the Netherlands or had been deprived of their posts. A large royal army was camped just outside London on Putney Heath as a safeguard.\nOn 2 February 1685, King Charles became seriously ill. Fearing a move by the exiles in the Netherlands, the government immediately closed the ports, arrested political opponents and put troops on standby. Charles died on 6 February. James immediately summoned the privy council and gave an impassioned speech promising to \"preserve this Government both in Church and State as it is now by Law Establish'd\". The relieved council had a transcript published in the London Gazette, from where it was read by the clergy from the pulpit to their congregations. The date of the coronation was set for 23 April, Saint George's Day, leaving only a few weeks for preparation; the French ambassador noted that James believed the coronation would put his accession beyond dispute. For the first time for the Stuart dynasty, there was to be no Scottish coronation, on the grounds that the Scottish Succession Act 1681 appeared to remove the need for one. The late King Charles, who had converted to Catholicism on his deathbed, was given a discrete private funeral after dark on 14 February.\n\n\n== Preparation ==\nAs was the usual procedure, a Coronation Committee was convened shortly after the accession. In attendance were the king, representatives of the College of Heralds, and officers of state such as the Lord Great Chamberlain, the Lord High Treasurer, the Master of the Great Wardrobe, and most importantly, the Earl Marshal, who had overall charge of the planning. At the first meeting, James ordered that a lavish and detailed record of the coronation be made, a work undertaken by Francis Sandford, the Lancaster Herald, assisted by Gregory King, the Rouge Dragon Pursuivant. The book that they produced, The History of the Coronation of the most High, most Mighty, and most Excellent Monarch, James II, was the first complete record of the ceremony to survive and includes not only a meticulous description but is lavishly illustrated by engravings, plans and diagrams. A function of the committee is to establish a Court of Claims to confirm those who claimed the right to perform ceremonial functions at the coronation, which conferred status and sometimes valuable rewards on the successful applicants; the court first met at the Palace of Westminster on 24 March and closed on 9 April, only a fortnight before the event itself.\nFor the first time since 1377, there was no consideration given to holding a royal entry procession through the City of London. The exact reason why the tradition was abandoned was not recorded, but later suggestions include that James preferred to spend the money on jewels for his consort, that there was insufficient time for preparation, or that the ostentation of these processions had gone out of fashion. However, a more probable reason was that the Protestant-minded City had been a leading force in the Exclusion Crisis, resulting in the loss of their royal charter and the purging of opponents in the City elite, thus making the reception of such a grand event within London's walls problematic. The alternative adopted was to be a spectacular public firework display on the Thames opposite Whitehall Palace on the night of the coronation.\n\n\n=== Liturgy ===\nThe task of compiling the coronation liturgy fell to the Archbishop of Canterbury, William Sancroft. James required Sancroft to \"review the Forms of Divine Service used at former Coronations, and (keeping to the Essentials) to abridge, as much as might be, the extream length thereof\". The subtext of this order was the omission of the Holy Communion or Eucharist from the service, which had been a fundamental part of English coronations since records began, so as not to compromise James's Catholic beliefs. An added complication was the need to include the coronation of a queen consort; James had married Mary, the daughter of Alfonso IV, Duke of Modena, in a proxy marriage in 1673.\nSancroft was aided in the project by six other bishops, who consulted not only the last major revision to the coronation liturgy, the 14th century Liber Regalis, but also the records of the post-Reformation coronations beginning with that of James I and Anne in 1603. Besides deleting much material, Sancroft also amended some of the blessings of objects to become blessings of the King and Queen, so as to conform with Anglican theology. The resulting abridgement was described by the church historian Jocelyn Perkins as \"revolutionary vandalism\", but Sancroft's text (with Communion reinstated) became the model for future British coronations into the 20th century.\n\n\n=== Infrastructure ===\n\nThe Coronation Committee also oversaw the required infrastructure for the event, which was carried out by the Office of Works. Fortunately, the Surveyor of the King's Works was Sir Christopher Wren, who had also fulfilled that function at the previous coronation in 1661. Sanford's detailed account provides for the first time the exact layout prepared for the coronation, both in the abbey and in Westminster Hall where the event would start and conclude. In the abbey, the area where the coronation ceremonies would take place was located at the crossing where the four arms of the cruciform church meet and was known as the \"theatre\". Here, a raised wooden platform 40 feet (12 m) long, 50 feet (15 m) wide and 8 feet (2.4 m) tall was surmounted by a further stepped platform or pulpitum for the king's and queen's thrones. Tiered seating supported on wooden scaffolding filled the north and south transepts; further galleries filled the chancel arcades to accommodate foreign dignatories, the musicians and choir, and for the first time, the Scottish and Irish peers, while the less distinguished were seated high in the triforium. The nave was also filled with galleries, although those who had paid for a seat there would have only seen the entry and recessional processions, and be able to hear little except the music. Westminster Hall had to be cleared for the traditional coronation banquet, it being normally partitioned into separate courtrooms. Galleries were constructed along each side for spectators. At the southern end, a canopied dais hung about with rich tapestries was built for the king and queen, while at the opposite end, a painted wood and board triumphal arch was installed.\nJames had established a Catholic chapel at Whitehall Palace and it was there that James and Mary are believed to have been privately anointed and crowned by his chaplain on the night before the official Anglican coronation.\n\n\n== Procession ==\n\nOn 23 April, the ceremonies started at Westminster Hall. Participants had to be in their places by 8 am. The King and Queen arrived at 11.30, after the short journey by barge from Whitehall Palace. The crown jewels and regalia were brought to the hall in procession by the Dean and Chapter of Westminster Abbey, where they were ceremonially distributed to their rightful bearers. The processional route from hall to the crossing of the abbey via New Palace Yard and King Street (now one side of Parliament Square) was covered with blue cloth to a total length of 1,220 yards (1,120 m), bounded by wooden rails and ranks of Foot and Horse Guards. Sandford's book illustrates the entire procession in nineteen detailed engravings, showing first King's Herb Woman and then the peers, clergy and heralds, with the King and Queen walking under canopies borne by the Barons of the Cinque Ports, one of whom was the diarist Samuel Pepys. The 15-minute procession included the choirs of the Chapel Royal and Westmintser Abbey together with drummers and trumpeters, who sang an anthem, O Lord, grant the King a long life, probably composed by William Child for the 1661 coronation.\n\n\n== Service ==\n\nThe king's entrance was accompanied by the anthem I was glad, based on Psalm 122, a text that had been first used at the coronation of Charles I in 1626. There is some doubt about the composer, since Sandford attributes it to Henry Purcell, but the manuscript of the music that is generally accepted to have been used is attributed to John Blow. The music is in three distinct sections, and the first break may have allowed the choir to make their way from the procession into their gallery. It is probably in this gap that the now customary Vivats were performed for the first recorded time by the King's Scholars of Westminster School. As the Queen entered the choir, she was greeted with the acclamation; \"VIVAT REGINA MARIA\" and the King following with \"VIVAT JACOBUS REX\". Sandford says that the Vivats were sung, but it is not known what tune was used; musicologist Matthias Range speculates that it may have been an early version of God save the King. It is unknown if Vivats were used at previous coronations, but a Tudor version by Thomas Ashwell survives.\nSancroft's re-ordering of the service resulted in the abandoning of several historical prayers, moving the litany to precede the coronation oath and moving Veni Creator Spiritus to before the sermon. This was preached by Francis Turner, the Bishop of Ely, who campared James to Charles I whom he extolled as a martyr. Another amendment to the traditional format was the moving of the investment with the coronation ring and the Sceptre with Dove to after the crowning, probably to emphasise that the whole investiture was important.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nThe 1685 coronation is notable amogst early modern coronations for the number of composers that contributed, although with no attempt to follow a single style or theme. The responsibility for organising the coronation music apparently rested with John Blow, the Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal, as he was given \"Five Yards of fine Scarlet Cloth for his Mantle as Composer\". A \"little organ\" was installed in the choir gallery and removed afterwards; it was played by Francis Forcer the Elder, who also replaced Blow singing in the choir while the latter was conducting. The combined choirs of the Chapel Royal and Westminster Abbey totalled twenty boy trebles and forty-eight gentlemen, who were accompanied by an orchestra of thirty-six musicians. Listed amongst the Chapel Royal basses was the composer Henry Purcell, who was also the abbey organist, although there is no evidence that the great organ was played during the coronation.\nAside from the entrance anthem described above, other notable music included; an anthem, Let thy hand be strengthened, based on Psalm 89 and composed by Blow, Come, Holy Ghost, our souls inspire, a translation of Veni Creator in an Anglican chant setting by William Turner, and at the anointing, Zadok the Priest, in a setting by Henry Lawes, probably the one that had been used at the previous coronation. The anointing ended with a new anthem by Blow, Behold, O God our defender and the King's crowning was followed by The King shall rejoice from Psalm 21 in a lost setting by Turner. The procession from St Edward's Chair to the throne was accompanied by  the Te Deum in a chant by William Child. For the homage, a new test was taken from Psalm 89, ‘God spake sometime in visions, composed by Blow and perhaps chosen because of the verse, \"I will set his Domination also in the Sea: And his Right Hand in the Floods\", which may have been a reference to James's previous success as Lord High Admiral of England.\nThere were no precedents for music for the crowning of Queen Mary, since the records of the previous queen consort's coronations in 1603 and 1625 made no mention of any. The anthem, My heart is inditing, was composed by Purcell. Sancroft chose texts from Psalm 45 with additional single verses from Psalm 147 and the Book of Isiah. The anthem is in three distinct parts, the first for the Queen's procession to the throne next to the King, and the second and third while both were seated enthroned. The opening text of the second part may be seen as a veiled warning by Sancroft to the foreign Catholic queen of a Protestant kingdom; \"Hearken, O daughter, and consider, incline thine ear: forget also thine own people, and thy father's house\". The third section was written in a major key by Purcell, providing a grand finale to the whole ceremony.\n\n\n=== Regalia ===\nThe crown Jewels of England had been remade in 1661, following the destruction of the medieval originals during the Commonwealth of England. There having been no queen consort's coronations since theRestoration, a new state crown was made for Mary, along with a circlet or diadem to be worn in the procession to the abbey. The total cost of the queen's jewels was £35,000 despite the gem stones being hired, a figure described by the Duke of Albemarle as \"an immense summ\".\n\n\n== Banquet ==\n\nFollowing the coronation service, there was a return procession from the abbey to Westminster Hall, during which the cloth of gold canopy under which the King was walking was said to have ripped and the crown was said to have almost fallen off the King's head; these were taken as bad omens for the forthcoming reign.\nThe banquet, meticulously recorded by Sandford, consisted of 1,445 dishes, 175 of which were served to the King's table, at a total cost of £1,209 15s 7½d. The dishes included stags' tongues, roast udders, cold puffins and caviar. The high point of the ceremonial was the entry of the hereditory King's Champion, Sir Charles Dymock, to throw down a gauntlet three times, as the Garter Principal King of Arms read out a challenge to anyone disputing the right of the new king. The King and Queen left at 7 o'clock, ordering a postponement of the planned firework display until the next evening \"by reason of the great fatigue of the day\". Nevertheless, Sandford records that in London there were \"Bonfires, Ringing of Bells, Royal Healths to Their MAJESTIES, and all other Expressions of an Universal Joy\".\n\n\n== After celebrations ==\nThe postponed firework display was devised by the King's Engineer, Major Martin Beckman, a Swedish artillery expert, who had also overseen the 1661 coronation fireworks during which he had been badly injured. At 9:30, the King and Queen appeared on the terrace of Whitehall Palace accompanied by a large number of courtiers. Fortunately, the tide was out, which saved any of the immense crowd from drowning. Three or four people were injured by stray pyrothechnics. No record of any music has survived, but it seems certain that the King's musicians contributed. The centre-piece of the display included two large pyramids and allegorical figures, surmounted by the royal cyphers, the imperial crown and over them all, a representation of the sun. An illuminated figure representing Neptune sailed past, followed by nineteen firework swans. The display continued for three-quarters of an hour.\nThe London Gazette reported local celebrations of feasting, bonfires and fireworks in Bristol, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, Norwich, Nottingham, Prescot, Saltash and Shrewsbury. Local reports record coronation events in many smaller communities, such as Lyme Regis where there was a procession of 300 virgins. Although these events were generally sponsored by civic and church authorities, there does seem to have been genuine popular support for the new King and Queen.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\nArcher, Ian W (2019). \"Chapter 13: Royal Entries, the City of London, and the Politics of Stuart Successions\".

        "content": "The 2024 Plymouth City Council election is due to be held on 2 May 2024 to elect members of Plymouth City Council in England. It will coincide with local elections across the United Kingdom.\nIn the previous election in 2023, Labour gained overall control, winning seats at the expense of the Conservative Party and the Independent Alliance, a group of councillors who had left their parties.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== History ===\n\nPlymouth City Council is due to hold local elections, along with councils across England as part of the 2024 local elections. The council elects its councillors in thirds, with a third of seats being up for election every year for three years, with no election each fourth year to correspond with councillors' four-year terms. Councillors defending their seats in this election were previously elected in 2021, which had been delayed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In that election, fourteen Conservative candidates and five Labour candidates were elected.\nElections in Plymouth are usually competitive between the Labour Party and the Conservative Party. The council was controlled by the Labour Party from the 2018 council election until the 2021 council election, when the council entered no overall control, with no party holding a majority of seats. Several Conservative councillors were suspended or resigned from their party, and the Conservative council leader Nick Kelly was replaced by Richard Bingley after Kelly lost a confidence vote in February 2022. Some former Conservative councillors rejoined their former group after the 2022 council election, giving the party an overall majority on 17 May 2022. Kelly resigned from the Conservative group on 15 October 2022 after being suspended, returning the council to no overall control. Several other councillors resigned from the Conservative group with some forming a group called the Independent Alliance, led by Kelly and also including the former Labour councillor Chaz Singh.\nThe Conservative council leader Richard Bingley signed an executive order to approve the felling of 110 mature trees in Plymouth City Centre in March 2023, as part of longstanding plans to regenerate the city centre. The decision was legally challenged and criticised. He resigned as council leader the following week.\nLabour won fifteen seats in the subsequent 2023 council election, winning overall control of the council. The Conservatives won only one seat, while independent candidates who had been members of the Independent Alliance group won in Plympton and the former Conservative councillor Steve Ricketts was elected as an independent candidate in Drake ward.\n\n\n=== Developments since 2023 ===\n\n\n==== Defections and suspensions ====\nThe Conservative councillor Philip Partridge left the Conservative group to form a new \"Free Independents\" group led by Ricketts. The independent Plympton councillors formed an \"Independent Group\". Andrea Loveridge left the Conservative group in December 2023 to sit as an independent councillor.\n\n\n==== Efford and Lipson by-election ====\nThe Labour councillor Brian Vincent died in April 2023, having first being elected in 1997 and having served continuously as a councillor since 2006.\nThe Labour candidate Paul McNamara won the ensuing by-election on 15 June.\n\n\n==== July 2023 by-elections ====\nIn June 2023, the Conservative councillor and former council leader Vivien Pengelly died and the Labour councillor Sue McDonald resigned due to family health reasons. Both ensuing by-elections took place on 27 July 2023. The Labour candidate Stefan Kirzanac won Pengelly's Plymstock Dunstone seat and the former MP Alison Raynsford retained McDonald's St Peter and the Waterfront seat for the Labour Party.\n\n\n== Council composition ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Candidates ==\n\n\n=== Budshead ===\n\n\n=== Compton ===\n\n\n=== Devonport ===\n\n\n=== Efford and Lipson ===\n\n\n=== Eggbuckland ===\n\n\n=== Ham ===\n\n\n=== Honicknowle ===\n\n\n=== Moor View ===\n\n\n=== Peverell ===\n\n\n=== Plympton Chaddlewood ===\n\n\n=== Plympton Erle ===\n\n\n=== Plympton St Mary ===\n\n\n=== Plymstock Dunstone ===\n\n\n=== Plymstock Radford ===\n\n\n=== Southway ===\n\n\n=== St Budeaux ===\n\n\n=== St Peter and the Waterfront ===\n\n\n=== Stoke ===\n\n\n=== Sutton and Mount Gould ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Schweiz 4 (German for Switzerland 4), also known under equivalent names in Switzerland's other official languages, was a Swiss terrestrial television channel owned by SRG SSR, the federal broadcasting corporation. The channel evolved from the former S Plus, a channel that existed since 1993 and whose frequencies dated back to the Sports Network (Sportkette) created in 1982 following the vertiginous rise of sports broadcasts on Swiss television.\n\n\n== Background and history ==\nSportkette Plus or Sport Plus, marketed as SPlus, was a sports overflow channel with Roy Oppenheim at the helm. The slogan of the service was \"One Program on Two Channels\" (Ein Programm auf zwei Kanälen). The channel received a licence from the Federal Council on 18 November 1992, in order to broadcast and started its services on 25 September 1993, for the whole of Switzerland. The coverage was limited to German-speaking Switzerland and had overspill to Romandy in the Rostigräden area.\nFrom January 1994, S Plus started carrying repeats of SF DRS's Tagesschau, followed by Romansh-language programming starting in April that year. These programmes included newscast Telesguard three times a week (Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays), Sunday programme by Svizra Rumantscha fortnightly, the live magazine show Damondas da..., Tschà for children eight times in the year and Istorgias di buna notg (bedtime story) once a week. All of the programmes were carried with German subtitles.\nOn 1 March 1995, the channel was renamed Schweiz 4. Unlike the previous S Plus, carriage of the terrestrial signal was nationwide, with the aim of broadcasting one channel per language sector.\nOn 1 September 1997, Schweiz 4 shut down, being replaced by three individual second networks tied to their respective language broadcasters: SF2 in the German regions, TSR 2 in Romandy and TSI 2 in Ticino.\n\n\n== Programming ==\nSuisse 4, mainly programmed Euronews during the morning. In the afternoon, the Swissview program, consisting of aerial shots from a helicopter flying over the whole of Switzerland, was the channel's most regular program during the two and a half years of its existence. The programme stemmed from the channel's graphic identity, which featured aerial shots of Switzerland taken from a hot air balloon. The idea was created by Mario Fumasoli, who suggested the creation of the programme. Little by little, the program diversified to include series, but mainly cultural and sports programs as well as films and documentaries during the evening. The Suisse 4 program was quite close to that of the later Swiss public channel, HD Suisse.\nAmong the channel's own productions, the program on federal politics was a first experience of trilingual editorial, located in Bern, near the Federal Palace. There were notably the following polyglot journalists: Massimo Isotta, Nicolas Rossé, Raphaël Engel, Anne-Lise von Bergen, Georges Gandola and others.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTelevision in Switzerland\n\n\n== References ==",

During World War II, he could not enlist as a soldier due to his poor eyesight, and as a result, he held an administrative role within the Royal Army Pay Corps as an accountant and auditor. He was also involved in logistical tasks, such as locating stranded soldiers and organising food supplies. He met his future wife, Blodwen (née Roberts), at a dance during the war; they married in 1942 and their only daughter, Susan, was born the following year. Tinniswood went on to work as an accountant for Royal Mail and Shell-Mex and BP before retiring in 1972. Blodwen died from lung cancer in 1986, after 44 years of marriage. \n\n\n=== Later life ===\nIn his later years, Tinniswood moved to a care home in Southport, Merseyside. His 110th birthday in August 2022 was accompanied by a live music performance at his residence, and he also received a clock paying tribute to Liverpool F.C., of which Tinniswood is an avid fan. As of April 2024, he has four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.\n\n\n== Health and longevity ==\nTinniswood became the oldest living British man on 25 September 2020, upon the death of 108-year-old Harry Fransman. In interviews given on his 109th and 111th birthdays, he stated that the key to his longevity was \"moderation\". After being issued a certificate by Guinness World Records for being the world's oldest man he also stated that his longevity was \"pure luck\" and that \"You either live long or you live short, and you can’t do much about it”.\nHe became the oldest living man in Europe on 7 January 2024, upon the death of 111-year-old André Ludwig of France. On 2 April 2024, upon the death of 114-year-old Juan Vicente Pérez of Venezuela, he became the oldest validated living man in the world and received recognition from Guinness World Records two days later. Due to his administrative and logistical role during the Second World War, he was also said to be \"the world's oldest surviving male World War II veteran.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nOldest people\nList of the verified oldest people\nList of British supercentenarians\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Johan Engelbert \"Joop\" Hueting (25 September 1927 - 11 November 2018) was a Dutch psychologist, soldier and whistleblower about war crimes committed by the Dutch military in the Indonesian National Revolution.\n\n\n== Life ==\nHueting was born in The Hague on 25 September 1927. In 1946, he was sent as a soldier to Indonesia to take part in the Dutch military's actions against the recently declared Indonesia. He returned to the Netherlands in 1950.\nOn 17 January 1969, Hueting gave an interview to Dutch public broadcaster VARA in which he discussed the war crimes committed by his unit and him in Indonesia. The interview had originally been scheduled for 19 December 1968, but was moved in order not to interfere with Christmas season. The interview was the first to bring the crimes to the Dutch public's attention. It received wide attention, both positive and negative. Hueting and his family had to leave their home for some time due to threats to their lives.\nThe Dutch government conducted a short investigation in response to the revelations, resulting in the Excessennota which absolved most Dutch soldiers of responsibility.\nHueting died on 11 November 2018 in Amsterdam. He had collected a wide array of documents related to Indonesia in a private archive. As of 2020, these remained in private hands due to Dutch archives not being interested in acquiring them.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Nelly Trumel (1938–2018) was a French painter, anarcha-feminist activist and radio presenter.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nNelly Campo was born in Paris on 12 August 1938. Raised in a Catholic family, she was the daughter of garage owner André Campo and secretary Simone Frenisy. Although she described her father as a \"tyrant\" who dominated the family, her mother encouraged her to pursue an education. After graduating as a Bachelor of Science from the Lycée Marcelin-Berthelot, she enrolled at the EPF School of Engineering, from which she graduated in 1958.\nAfter leaving school, she got married and gave birth to two children: a son in 1960 and a daughter in 1966. She focused all of her attentions on raising the two, but life as a housewife made her unhappy and her husband was psychologically abusive towards her.\nIn 1968, Trumel began seeking opportunities to get out of her house. She helped to establish socio-educational centres and joined the Federation of Parents' Councils (French: Fédération des conseils de parents d'élèves; FCPE), which she was involved in until her daughter left school. She briefly joined the Women's Grand Lodge Of France, but left after 3 months. At this time, she also began reading feminist theory, including The Second Sex by Simone de Beauvoir and Little Girls by Elena Gianini Belotti, which greatly influenced her to join the feminist movement.\nBy the 1970s, Trumel had also decided to take up painting and taught herself by working as a copyist at the Louvre. Her husband resented her new-found autonomy, but she began to resist him, especially after she started psychoanalysis in 1973, which helped her realise that she was being abused.\nShe divorced her husband in 1975 and immediately set to work as a painter, selling copies of her work in order to pay for her daughter's education. She joined the Souffles d'Elles, which published works about her paintings, and was a member of the Société des Artistes Français, among various other cultural associations. She joined the Union of Women Painters and Sculptors in 1988 and remained a member until its dissolution in 1993. Throughout her career, she participated in a number of exhibitions both as part of an association and by herself.\nBy this time, Trumel was already a committed anarcha-feminist. In 1984, she joined the Anarchist Federation and served on its women's commission. Having listened to Radio Libertaire since she was married, she volunteered her services to the radio station, initially working as a secretary while training as a radio technician. In 1986, on the 50th anniversary of the Spanish Revolution of 1936, Trumel started a new weekly anarcha-feminist radio programme Femmes Libres, named after the Spanish anarcha-feminist organisation Mujeres Libres. Slated for every Wednesday evening, she dedicated her programme to women's struggles and issues, welcoming various women guests onto the show. She also served as the station's secretary of programming from 1989 to 1991.\nDuring this time, she also attended meetings at La Maison des femmes and joined a number of women's organisations such as the Coordination of Associations for the Right to Abortion and Contraception (French: Coordination des associations pour le droit à l'avortement et à la contraception; CADAC), the National Collective for Women's Rights (French: Collectif national pour les droits des femmes; CNDF) and The Watch Dogs (French: Les Chiennes de garde; CDG). She also participated in the World March of Women when it began in 2000. In an interview with the Archives du Feminisme, when asked who her favourite feminist was, she responded \"To name one would be to betray the others and establish a hierarchy. Many have given me a lot\".\nBy 1997, Trumel was only hosting Femmes Libres once a fortnight, with other hosts taking over the show during her off-weeks. She again began concentrating on her painting career, focusing on the study of light and still life. Her favourite subjects for still life photos were potatoes that were in the process of sprouting, which she depicted as \"a sign of the eternal slavery of women\", as well as \"weapons to be thrown at the head of one's oppressor\".\nIn 2012, she stopped hosting her radio programme entirely, and in 2013, she retired to Toulouse. Nelly Trumel died on 3 December 2018. Her work, including over 1,600 hours of radio broadcasts, has been collected and digitised by the Centre des Archives du féminisme.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Femmes Libres\", 1986-1999 : une émission féministe de Radio Libertaire",

        "content": "The Otuken Union Party (Turkish: Ötüken Birliği Partisi) is a Turkish ultranationalist political party founded on December 20, 2017.\n\n\n== History ==\nOn 20 December 2017, the Otuken Union Party was established by Mehmet Hakan Semerci as an official political party in Turkey. The party is the first Turkish nationalist party which does not deny its racism, but rather takes pride in it. The party is fully secular but has some Tengrist elements. They are named after the city of Otuken in Central Asia where Turkic peoples allegedly originate from. The party admires Nihal Atsız.\nThe program of the party stated that if the party ever came to power, they would make sure that Turkey is for Turks only, ban marriages between Turks and foreigners, revoke Turkish citizenships and deport those who are not ethnic Turks, change school and İmam Hatip curriculums to further include nationalism, reduce number of Islamic schools as to not exceed the minimum requirement of state-appointed Imams, completely secularise public school curriculum, remove all foreign-language courses in schools until secondary school where they can be taken as electives, although courses in Turkic languages would always be available in all grades, have a zero tolerance policy for refugees, and enforce capital punishment. The party aims to unite Turkic peoples into a united, self-reliant, and dominant country.\nIn 2019, the party visited Sedat Peker.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Perkasa Alam Teungku Abdullah Syafi is better known as Teungku Lah is a GAM fighter figure. He once served as Commander of the Free Aceh Movement.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nTeungku Abdullah Syafi'i or Teungku Lah is a very charismatic GAM Commander, respected by friends and feared by opponents. Among his troops, Teungku Lah was known to be very firm but polite. He is also polite and modest.\nTeungku Lah is the leader of GAM's military wing. He once served as Commander of GAM for the Pidie Region, and most recently as Commander of the Free Aceh Movement throughout Sumatra. It is said that Teungku Lah led GAM guerrillas in the Bireuen area for more than 20 years.\nTeungku Lah did not receive military education in Libya, like Arjuna or Ahmad Kandang. This is what makes him not really like the use of violence in fighting. The power of weapons is only for self-defense.\nTeungku Lah was born in Gampong Seuneubok Rawa, Peusangan, Bireuen, about four kilometers from Jalan Medan-Banda Aceh, Matang Glumpang Dua area, Bireuen. Only three kilometers of the connecting road to the village is well paved, while another kilometer or so is full of gravel and dust. In some parts you can still see traces of peeling asphalt. On either side of the road, there is a wide expanse of rice fields, connected by shady and beautiful hilly areas.\nIn that village, Teungku Abdullah Syafie was born. If we refer to the information written on the grave of Blang Sukon, Cubo, Pidie Jaya, he was born on October 17, 1947. Meanwhile, in a lot of information in the media, he was written as being born in 1952. No one knows which version is correct. However, her sister, Fatimah, has a different statement. According to him, his older brother was born around 1955. He only studied up to grade three at the Peusangan State Madrasah Aliyah. Leaving the school, Teungku Lah chose to study religion at a number of Islamic boarding schools in Aceh. Teungku Lah became involved with GAM in early 1980 (there is also news that Teungku Lah joined GAM the day after Hasan Tiro proclaimed GAM in Gunong Halimon).\nIn fact, Teungku Lah's youth was unique. He is often seen in the theater world with the Jeumpa group. Very far from being military. However, recently, this really helped Teungku Lah in terms of disguise. Teungku Lah's mobility was not detected. Acehnese people say that Teungku Lah has ileume peurabon (the science of eliminating oneself).\n\n\n== Commander of GAM ==\nAt first he led a platoon from the Tiro Central Command Headquarters. In May 1995, Teungku Lah's troops joined Mantri Hamid Idris' troops based in Geulumpang Minyeuk. This troop has around 15 weapons of various types and was classified as a large GAM troop before the reform era.\nOn January 1, 1996, Teungku Lah was appointed Commander of GAM Tiro Central Command replacing Commander Tgk. Handler Rasyid died in mid-1995. After reform, the Aceh conflict escalated. Teungku Lah, who is the Supreme Commander of GAM, automatically becomes the TNI's number 1 fugitive.\n\n\n== Died ==\nTeungku Abdullah Syafie died on January 22, 2002, in Jiem-Jiem, Bandar Baru, Pidie in an ambush by the TNI. His wife (Fatimah bint Abdurrahman) and two of her bodyguards named Muhammad bin Ishak and Muhammad Daud bin Hasyim were also killed in the attack. The four were buried behind Teungku Lah's house in Cubo, Pide Jaya on January 24, 2002.\nBefore he died, Teungku once made a will, \"If one day you hear the news that I have been martyred, don't feel sad and discouraged. Because I always pray to Allah SWT to make me a martyr when Aceh's independence is very close. I don't want to get any position if this country (Aceh) becomes independent.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 1832 Rhode Island gubernatorial election was held on 4 April 1832 in order to elect the Governor of Rhode Island. Incumbent National Republican Governor Lemuel H. Arnold won a plurality of the vote against former Democratic-Republican Governor James Fenner and incumbent Anti-Masonic Speaker of the Rhode Island House of Representatives William Sprague III. However, as no candidate received a majority of the total votes cast as was required by Rhode Island law, run-offs were held until a candidate received a majority. Following four run-offs which were held on 16 May, 18 July, 28 August and 21 November, no candidate was able to receive a majority. So Governor Arnold remained to serve as governor during the run-offs and in January 1833, the Rhode Island state legislature formalized Governor Arnold's win as he had come in first place in every election and run-off that was held. This permitted him to continue on as governor until the end of the term on 1 May 1833.\n\n\n== General election ==\nOn election day, 4 April 1832, incumbent National Republican Governor Lemuel H. Arnold won the election by a margin of 440 votes against his foremost opponent former Democratic-Republican Governor James Fenner. However, as no candidate had received a majority of the vote, several run-offs were held, all won by Governor Arnold but again without a majority. So the Rhode Island state legislature formalized Governor Arnold's win in January 1833, and he was allowed to serve out the rest of the term. He thereby retained National Republican control over the office of Governor. Arnold was sworn in for his second term on 1 May 1832 so he could remain as Governor admist the awaiting scheduled run-offs.\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n=== General Election ===\n\n\n=== First Runoff ===\n\n\n=== Second Runoff ===\n\n\n=== Third Runoff ===\n\n\n=== Fourth Runoff ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Lucie Azema (born 1989), is a French journalist, long-distance traveller, and feminist. She questions the masculine vision of adventure and travel writing.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nAzema was born in 1989 into a family that was not particularly well-travelled. However, she became an assiduous reader of travel writers, such as Jules Verne and Alexandra David-Néel. In 2011, she left France to study in Beirut, Lebanon. Later, she lived in India where she wrote a blog for Courrier expat, in Lebanon, and in Turkey. She moved to Iran in 2017 and as of 2023 was dividing her time between Turkey and France.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 2021, Azema published Les femmes aussi sont du voyage (Women are also travellers), which has been described as a feminist manifesto to cast off. In this book she argues that while the man leaves, the woman waits for his return. Much of the time, women do not dare to travel out of fear although, statistically, the most dangerous place for women is at home. Women's travels have always been opposed, made invisible, ridiculed, or prohibited. With women having been historically confined in convents, asylums or the home, travel becomes one of the most symbolic means for them to free themselves from their captive condition. Inspired by true stories from travel literature and her personal experiences, Azema uses the book to denounce the male vision of adventure, which often sexualises places such as Thailand and Polynesia in a misogynistic way, and to emphasise the stories of famous female explorers. Azema stresses that the history of the world has been written by men, most of the time Westerners, which makes travel writing unequal, dominant and colonialist. She argues that long-distance women travellers, such as David-Néel, Ella Maillart, Annemarie Schwarzenbach, and Isabelle Eberhardt have also travelled the world and recounted their adventures, but have been subsequently made invisible.\nAzema's second book L'usage du thé (The use of tea) was published in 2022. With the subtitle a sensitive story from the end of the world, the book helps the reader discover the tea plant and its usage. She argues that tea is a symbol of travel and she takes the reader through the history of this thousand-year-old drink, from the first caravans that spread its use up to the era of colonisation. From its origins in China to its exploitation by British tea companies, the drink is a paradoxically a symbol of both travel and a sedentary lifestyle. It provides social rituals. The book's title was inspired by L'Usage du monde by Nicolas Bouvier.\nAzema has been a jury member for What a Trip, a festival of film of travel and adventure, held in Montpelier, France.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nLes femmes aussi sont du voyage: L'émancipation par le départ (Women are also travellers. Emancipation through departure). Paris, Flammarion, 2021, 286 p. ISBN 9782080208613.

        "content": "The Chao Phraya Express Boat Yellow Flag (Thai: เรือด่วนเจ้าพระยาธงเหลือง Ruea Duan Chao Phraya Thong Ylaeng) Is a Chao Phraya Special Express Boat route that often stops at important pier. that most Thai citizens use to go to work This results in saving more time during rush hour. This passenger boat route only operates in the morning and evening or during rush hour.\n\n\n== Schedule ==\n\n\n== Boats ==\nChao Phraya Express boats operates mainly two types of boats; all of them are built mainly out of wood.\nSingle-screw boat:                                                                                                       \nThey are able to hold around 90-120 passengers at a time and are around 26–32 m (85–105 ft) long and about 2.7 m (8 ft 10 in) wide. The area on the back of the boat (floor painted yellow) is normally restricted to embarking and disembarking passengers, but some people like to stand there when the boat is highly crowded. There are two 2-step stairs on each side of the boat connecting the yellow pad on the back to the passenger area inside the boat, while in between those stairs is a non-functioning on-board toilet. The engine room, in the appearance of a large wooden box, is inboard in the center line of the boat in front of the seating area. There are two rows of seats on the left and another two on the right and an aisle passing in the middle. On the newer boats, the roof from over the engine room to the middle section of the boat is raised for extra headroom because most standing passengers on crowded boats are standing there. This design has been applied to all other boats that are being built in the company's shipyards in Bangkok and Ayutthaya. These type of boats operate on all non-flagged, orange-flagged and green-yellow-flagged boats, but also off-peak direction trips of yellow-flagged boats. The fleet has about 50 boats of this type.\nTwin-screw boat or \"super size\" boat:                                                                                 \nThis type of boat holds around 120 to 180 passengers. Unlike the single-screw boat, the boat driver sits in a small pod above the passenger deck, similar to a cockpit on board a Boeing 747 airliner, giving view for passenger in the front-most row and public access to the boat's front deck for passengers who desire to watch the view from the boat's front without any obstruction (except for the Thai national flag). It is about 30–40 m (98–131 ft) long and about 5–7 m (16–23 ft) wide. Unlike a single-screw boat, its seating area stretches over the entire boat, while most seating is in front of engines. The engine rooms are placed lower than those in single-screw boats, and some passengers prefer to sit on them when it is crowded. There are 8 seats behind each engine. There are two aisles in the seating area in front of the engines and 3 aisles behind the engines. There are two toilets, one on the port and another one on the starboard, located in front of the engines. This type of boat serves as yellow flagged express boat in peak hours, and serves as tourist boats in off-peak hours. The fleet has about 15 boats of this type.\n\n\n== Route ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nChao Phraya Express Boat site\nChao Phraya Express at TransitBangkok.com\nMap of Chao Phraya Express, Khlong boats, BTS, and MRT\nThe Mass Transport Boats of Bangkok (Chao Phraya Express) (Photos)\nMarineLink.com review\nChaopraya express boat Guide",

        "content": "O Come, Divine Messiah is a popular Christian hymn for the season of Advent before Christmas. It recalls the time of waiting of the people of Israel before the birth of Christ. This song is at the same time a call to adore Jesus Christ present in the Eucharist. The melody is taken from an old Christmas song of the 16th century, Let your beasts graze.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nO Come, Divine Messiah is adapted from the old traditional French Christmas song Let your beasts graze, attested in the former French province of Bresse in the 16th century. The melody had already been plagiarized for satirical uses. The lyrics are the work of Abbot Simon-Joseph Pellegrin in the first half of the 18th century, who composed for the attention of the young Demoiselles de Saint-Cyr at the Maison royale de Saint-Louis many verses on the songs of the old Christmases of France, in order to modernize the text. The melody was also used by Marc-Antoine Charpentier in his Messe de minuit pour Noël.\nSince the 19th century, a modern version of the text, considerably impoverished, and a 4-part harmonization written in 1845 by Abbé Lambert have been in use in Catholic communities in France.\nIn 1872, the carol was translated into English by Sister Mary of Saint Philip.\n\n\n== Lyrics ==\nThe original lyrics of Simon-Joseph Pellegrin (1663–1745) are inspired from Isaiah 4:14, Luke 2:4-14 and John 3:16-18.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Chikuzen Kokubun-ji (筑前国分寺) is a Shingon-sect Buddhist temple in the Kokubunji neighborhood of the city of Dazaifu, Fukuoka, Japan. It is one of the few surviving provincial temples established by Emperor Shōmu during the Nara period (710 – 794). Due to this connection, the foundation stones of the Nara period temple overlapping the present day complex were designated as a National Historic Site in 1922.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Shoku Nihongi records that in 741, as the country recovered from a major smallpox epidemic, Emperor Shōmu ordered that a monastery and nunnery be established in every province, the kokubunji (国分寺). These temples were built to a semi-standardized template, and served both to spread Buddhist orthodoxy to the provinces, and to emphasize the power of the Nara period centralized government under the Ritsuryō system.\nThe Chikuzen Kokubun-ji is located on a plateau northwest of the Dazaifu Government Office ruins. The modern temple overlaps the Nara period temple ruins. To the west are the ruins of the Kokubun-niji nunnery (not part of the National Historic Site designation), and to the east are Kokubu Tile Kiln ruins (separate National Historic Site designation) where the roof tiles for both temples were fired. Although created by Emperor Shōmu's edict, no documentary evidence of the precise date of the founding of the temple has survived. The earliest record dates from 801, when Buddhist statues and ritual implements were moved from a temple called Shiō-in to this temple, but were returned to their original location in 801. The temple also appears in the Engishiki records in the early 10th century. The temple then disappears from the historical record for centuries thereafter, and by the middle Edo period had been reduced to a small hermitage housing a statue of Yakushi Nyorai. However, this was not the original Nara period sculpture, but was a newer version carved in the Muromachi period.  The temple was subsequently abolished, but a priest from Edo rebuilt the hermitage and in the Genbun (1736–1741) and Tenmei eras (1781–1789), restoration and revitalization were attempted. The Main Hall burned down in 1827 and the Kuri was rebuilt in 1833.\nDuring archaeological excavations, original temple compound was found to be 192 meters square, and to contain the central gate, main hall, and auditorium arranged in a straight line, with cloisters extending from the left and right sides of the central gate to the main hall. The Five-story pagoda was enclosed by the cloister. This style, which is different from Todai-ji and the standardized layout of kokubun-ji temples (where the pagoda is outside the cloister) is common in temples in Kyushu founded before the Nara period. From the size of the pagoda foundations, it was a seven-story structure. A one-tenth scale replica of it is on display outside the Dazaifu City Cultural Fureai Museum. Per excavations, it appears that in the 9th century, the pagoda and lecture hall were renovated from a buried pillar foundation to a rough stone foundation, and that the pagoda disappeared in the 10th century followed by the lecture hall in the 11th century. Today, the current Kokubun-ji Hondo stands on the site of the original Kondō, and the positions of the surrounding auditorium, pagoda, and corridor have been restored.\nThe temple is a seven-minute walk (1.4 kilometers) from Tofurōmae Station on the Nishitetsu Tenjin Ōmuta Line.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Cultural Properties ==\nYakushi Nyorai (sculpture, wooden, seated image);  Muromachi period, designated an National Important Cultural Property in 1904.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\nprovincial temple\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nKyushu National Museum home page (in Japanese)\nDazaifu City home page(in Japanese)\nCultural Properties of Fukuoka Prefecture(in Japanese)\nFukuoka Tourism Web(in Japanese)",

The mural also contains the Four Symbols of Taoism, of which the Azure Dragon  is in good preservation, with the Vermilion Bird and Black Tortoise less clear.  Grave goods include magatama beads, glass beads, metal rings, horse harnesses (bridles, apricot leaves, crosspiece fittings, etc.), and weapons (sword scabbards, iron arrowheads). The tumulus is believed to date from the latter half of the 6th century, and to show a strong influence from Goguryeo. \nThe tumulus is open to the public on Mondays. The tumulus is approximately 13 kilometers west of Nōgata Station on the JR Kyushu Chikuhō Main Line.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\nDecorated kofun\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Takehara Kofun at Wikimedia Commons\n\nMiyawaka City home page (in Japanese)\nFukuoka Tourist web (in Japanese)\nCultural Properties of Fukuoka Prefecture (in Japanese)",

        "content": "The 2004 Sydney City Council election was held on 27 March 2004 to elect nine councillors and a lord mayor to the City of Sydney. The election was held as part of the statewide local government elections in New South Wales, Australia.\nThe election followed the amalgamation of Sydney with the neighbouring City of South Sydney. Independent MP Clover Moore was elected lord mayor, becoming the first popularly elected female Lord Mayor of Sydney.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 2002, parts of the City of South Sydney and Leichhardt were proposed to be merged with the City of Sydney. In 2003, Potts Point, Elizabeth Bay, Kings Cross, Darlinghurst, Chippendale, Ultimo and parts of Rushcutters Bay, Camperdown and Darlington were transferred from South Sydney to the City of Sydney. As the financial viability of the residual City of South Sydney was under threat as a result, the City of Sydney and the City of South Sydney were combined by proclamation on 6 February 2004. The 2003 merger was perceived as an attempt to bring more working class Labor Party voters into the City of Sydney.\n\n\n== Candidates ==\nA total of 67 candidates stood for election, including 14 lord mayoral candidates.\nLord mayoral candidates are listed in the order they appeared on the ballot:\n\n\n=== Team Clover ===\nOn 24 February 2004, independent MP Clover Moore announced she would run for lord mayor, labelling the council's sacking a \"cynical grab for power.\" Despite her ideological differences with Turnbull, she also sharply denounced the sacking of a democratically elected mayor.\nMoore formed the Clover Moore Independent team, which included six other candidates.\n\n\n=== Labor ===\nFormer federal MP Michael Lee contested as Labor's lord mayoral candidate. He officially announced his candidacy on 3 March 2004.\n\n\n=== Liberal ===\nFormer South Sydney councillor Shayne Mallard contested the election as the first-ever endorsed Liberal Party lord mayoral candidate.\n\n\n=== Others ===\nThe Greens contested the lord mayoralty for the first time, with Chris Harris as their candidate. The Australian Democrats and Socialist Alliance both endorsed candidates.\nIncumbent Sydney councillor Dixie Coulton, a former Living Sydney and Sydney Independents member, was one of six independent candidates.\n\n\n== References ==",

The play made its world debut in Melbourne. The play then toured in Sydney.\nThe Sydney Morning Herald said \"The drama is one dealing with life on the gold,\nfields in the early days. It is suitably staged and mounted, and received a flattering reception.\"\nWhen the play was revived in 1910 it was called Hunted to Death or Murder in Golden Gully. An ad said the play was being done for the first time and \"This drama is said to\nbe founded upon facts, and also deals with incidents in the career of the notorious Power.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Eirini \"Erini \" Tornesaki (Greek: Ειρήνη \"Ερήνη\" Τορνεσάκι) is a Greek singer and former Cirque Du Soleil vocalist. She toured with Cirque Du Soleil from 2014-2017 as the only vocalist in the show \"Kurios\" and appeared in 1,074 performances. She is currently signed to Minos EMI in Greece and Ropeadope in the U.S and plans to release her debut album in June 2024.\n\n\n== Early Life and Education ==\nErini was born in Heraklion, Crete in Greece on July 23, 1991 to a musical family. As a descendant of Greek-Anatolian refugees, preserving her musical heritage was important and she was introduced to the musical Greek-Anatolian tradition by her mother. Throughout her childhood she was involved in music, playing piano and cello and performing with her hometown's string orchestra and choir. In 2007, Erini attained first place at the 13th Pancretan Singing Competition.\nAt the age of 18, Erini moved from Crete to the United Kingdom to pursue her studies in Contemporary Vocals at the British and Irish Institute of Modern Music (BIMM). While there, she performed with Amy Winehouse's band, James Bay and Barry Manilow.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2014-2017: Cirque Du Soleil ===\nAfter going through a rigorous auditioning process for over a year, Erini was selected to tour with Cirque du Soleil in their show \"Kurios\" where she interpreted the role of \"Chanteuse de Rue\" (Street Singer). She toured North America over a three year period and performed in 1,074 performances from 2014-2017.\n\n\n=== 2018-2021: Berklee and Teaching ===\nUpon finishing her tour with Cirque du Soleil, Erini was accepted into the prestigious master's program at the Berklee Global Jazz Institute which she completed in 2018. A couple of months after graduating, she was offered a position to teach at the Berklee College of Music where she has been working since in addition to her career as a singer. Her first single \"Korasion Etragoudage\" was released in 2018 and went viral in the Greek community, amassing over 1 million views on Erini's Facebook page.\n\n\n=== 2022-Present: Debut Album ===\nIn 2022, Erini was awarded the honor of the Mass Cultural Council Fellowship in traditional arts in recognition of her efforts to preserve the cultural heritage of the Greek-Anatolian traditional music. In May 2023, Erini performed in a sold-out concert in New York and in October 2023, Erini performed at the WOMEX Festival in A Coruña, Spain. On April 3, 2024, Erini and Minos EMI announced on their Instagram pages that her first single off her debut album, \"Menexedes Kai Zoumpoulia\", will be released on April 19.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Lehlogonolo George Matlou (born 12 July 1998) is a South African soccer player who plays as a midfielder for Kaizer Chiefs in the Premier Soccer League.\nBorn in Soweto, Matlou was an U14 player at Orlando Pirates before joining the U15 team of Bidvest Wits in 2013. He overcame a career-threatening leg break which he suffered during the Metropolitan school tournament. Matlou came back to play for South Africa U20, among others in the 2017 COSAFA U-20 Cup. Following National First Division loan stints with Cape Town All Stars and Cape Umoya United, Bidvest Wits went defunct and Matlou went to Portugal to play for Sanjoanense in the third tier. In 2021 he claimed to have been called a \"little monkey\" by a referee.\nReturning to South Africa and Moroka Swallows, he made his first-tier debut in the 2021-22 South African Premier Division. He impressed enough, being called a \"ball wizard\" by The South African, to be bought by Kaizer Chiefs in the summer of 2022. He was called up for South Africa to play a 2022 African Nations Championship qualification match against the Comoros.\nMatlou struggled to break through and establish himself as a regular in Kaizer Chiefs. In 2024 it was reported that Kaizer Chiefs would not renew Matlou's contract, due to expire in the summer.\n\n\n== References ==",

Federalist nominee Richard Jackson Jr. won a plurality of the vote against incumbent Democratic-Republican Governor Henry Smith and Democratic-Republican candidate and incumbent Chief Justice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court Peleg Arnold. However, as no candidate received a majority of the total votes cast as was required by Rhode Island law, the election was forwarded to the Rhode Island legislature. When the legislature was also unable to elect a Governor, it was decided that Democratic-Republican Lieutenant Governor-elect Isaac Wilbour would serve out the term as Acting Governor.\n\n\n== General election ==\nOn election day, 2 April 1806, Federalist nominee Richard Jackson Jr. won the election by a margin of 565 votes against his foremost opponent incumbent Democratic-Republican Governor Henry Smith. As he however didn't receive a majority of all votes cast, the race was ultimately awarded to Democratic-Republican Lieutenant Governor-elect Isaac Wilbour, who would serve out the term as Acting Governor, thereby retaining Democratic-Republican control over the office of Governor. Wilbour was sworn in as the Acting 6th Governor of Rhode Island on 7 May 1806.\n\n\n=== Results ===\n\n\n== References ==",

He lived alone at 8 Silverdale Road, Oxton, from 1986 until his death in 2019. The terms of his lease allowed Gittins to decorate the house as he liked, without prior need to seek his landlord's consent. Over the 33 years he lived there he extensively decorated the entire flat. Gittins was interested in history, and was inspired by ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome in his decorations.\n\n\n== Discovery and preservation ==\nIn January 2020, the former rented ground-floor flat was found to contain a collection of outsider art produced by Gittins, and never previously seen. It includes sculptures of a lion and the head of the Minotaur, underwater scenes and rooms based on ancient Egyptian and Greek themes. A crowdfunding appeal was launched to save the work. Fundraising was also supported by Pulp singer Jarvis Cocker.\nDescriptions of visits to the flat in 2021 were written by Denise Courcoux in The Double Negative, Matthew Hogarth in Bido Lito! and Cathy Ward in Brut Journal. The Wirral Arts and Culture Community Land Trust (WACCLT) was established in December 2021 as the first arts-based community land trust in the United Kingdom, with the aim to \"save Ron's Place and create a stimulating, positive legacy for the Wirral and the wider community.\"\nThe semi-detached house containing the flat was auctioned on 1 March 2023 and was bought by WACCLT, with the help of a donation from the Muller Wimhurst Trust, to preserve the artworks. \nWriting in the journal Epidemiology and Psychiatric Sciences, Lisa Slominski says that \"Oscillating between an idiosyncratic subjectivity and universal offering, the power held in Ron's Place is undeniable.\" \nIn March 2024, the ground floor flat was given Grade II listed building status by Historic England. The director of The Twentieth Century Society, Catherine Croft, described the building as \"the first example of outsider art to be nationally listed.\"\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \nWirral Arts and Culture Community Land Trust\n\"Roman Villa, Birkenhead, Liverpool\".

        "content": "Neale Molaodi Sechele (1915–1985) was kgosi of the Bakwena. He was appointed to the position by the court in 1963 following the death of his brother Kgari Sechele II, and he was forced to abdicate in 1970. As Neale was appointed against the wishes of the people and he often neglected his responsibilities, he was regarded poorly by the Bakwena.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nNeale Molaodi Sechele was born in 1915. He was the son of Baruti Kgosidintsi and Phetogo, the ex-wife of kgosi Sechele II. Neale attended the Tati Training Institution and the Tiger Kloof Educational Institute. Neale was the younger brother of Sebele II, kgosi of the Bakwena. When Sebele was deposed by the British colonial administration in 1931, Neale's other brother Kgari Sechele II became kgosi.\n\n\n== Kgosi of the Bakwena ==\nNeale became kgosi of the Bakwena in 1963. Kgari's death had triggered a succession crisis in 1962, and the court held an inquiry in February 1963. Neale had been chosen as a compromise between the faction that supported Bonewamang Padi Sechele and the one that supported Moruakgomo. The court did not know that Neale was not a blood relative of his brothers' father. The decision to appoint Neale was directly influenced by the colonial administration.\nNeale was not well received by the Bakwena. He was not next in the line of succession, and at the time of his appointment he was unemployed and often engaged in heavy drinking. The royal family doubted his ability to rule, and he was widely seen as merely a government appointee. Neale frequently ignored the responsibilities of the bokgosi, declining to attend the kgotla and refusing to marry or have children. Neale is regarded as having been a poor kgosi. Jeff Ramsay described Neale as reigning \"ineffectively\". Neale's deputy chief from 1964 to 1969, Mack Sechele, was often the one leading the tribe in practice.\nOne effect of weak leadership over the Bakwena was that the tribe was not in a position to contest the development of a national government under Seretse Khama of the Bangwato. After the nation achieved independence, Neale neglected his responsibilities as a member of the District Council. Neale was an opponent of the Tribal Land Act, and he campaigned against it throughout the district. He had a poor understanding of the law, and a district councilor accompanied him to correct the false statements he made.\n\n\n== Abdication and death ==\nThe government of Botswana disapproved of Neale's performance as kgosi, and pressure for Neale to abdicate mounted in 1970. On 21 September 1970, a kgotla was called so a list of charges could be read against Neale. He chose to resign so as to avoid the impeachment process and to retain the right to his pension. Rather than appointing a new kgosi, the government replaced Neale with Bonewamang Padi Sechele as the district's \"Acting Tribal Authority\" in October 1970. Neale died in 1985.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nMbuya, Titus (1999). \"Legitimacy and Succession in Tswana States: The Case of BaKwena, 1930-1963\".

        "content": "The Kōshōji Kofun (光正寺古墳)  is a Kofun period burial mound, located in the Kōshōji neighborhood of the town of Umi, Fukuoka Prefecture Japan. The tumulus was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1975.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Kōshōji Kofun is a zenpō-kōen-fun (前方後円墳), which is shaped like a keyhole, having one square end and one circular end, when viewed from above. It is built on a hill on the right bank of the Umi River, which flows into Hakata Bay and is orientated to the west-northwest. It has a total length is approximately 54 meters, with a posterior circular portion 34 meters in diameter and five meters high. The anterior rectangular portion is approximately 20 meters wide and three meters high. The upper portion of the tumulus is covered with fukiishi. It is estimated from its shape and from excavated pottery shards to have been constructed in the first half of the Kofun period, or around the middle of the third century AD.\nThe posterior circular portion was found to contain a burial chamber containing three box-style sarcophagi, one wooden coffin, and one earthenware coffin. Grave goods included magatama beads, cylindrical beads, Haji ware pottery pots, and iron swords. The largest box-shaped sarcophagus was made from stones brought from a great distance, including basalt thought to be from Noko Island and talc from Mt. Wakasugi. The smaller sarcophagi are made from local stone. These three sarcophagi were also lined with vermillion pigment.\nThe Kōshōji Kofun is the largest keyhole-shaped tumulus in Kasuya District, and is thought to be the tomb of king of Fumikoku (不弥国), one of the countries that existed in the Japanese archipelago in the 3rd centuryaccording to The History of the Three Kingdoms, Wei's Dongyi biography, commonly known as Wajin Biography, and History of the Northern Dynasties. \nArtifacts from the site are stored in the Umi Town Museum of History and Folklore.  Currently, the surrounding area to the tumulus is being maintained as a historical park, and a one-fifth scale model of the tumulus as it originally looked is located  in the Guidance Plaza. The tumulus is about a 15-minute walk from Sue-Chuo Station on the JR Kyushu Kashii Line.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Koshoji Kofun at Wikimedia Commons\n\nUmi Town home page (in Japanese)\nFukuoka Tourism Web (in Japanese)\nCultural Porperties in Fukuoka Prefecture (in Japanese)",

        "content": "Dillan Solomons (born 30 May 1996) is a South African soccer player who plays as a defender for Kaizer Chiefs in the Premier Soccer League.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHe hails from Steenberg. As a young player he also participated in athletics, namely sprints, long jump and triple jump. According to IOL, he was \"arguably ... the fastest player in the league\" in 2022. He recorded several placements between 5th and 8th at South African age-group championships, and finished 12th in the long jump at the 2016 South African Championships. Solomons managed to surpass the 7-metre barrier in the long jump by recording 7.06 metres in April 2016 in Germiston.\nSolomons played one year for Milano United, then two years for Royal Eagles with whom he won promotion from the 2018-19 National First Division. Instead of contesting the 2019-20 South African Premier Division with the Royal Eagles, in July 2019 he moved to Stellenbosch Seeing very limited playing time, Solomons moved back to the second tier with All Stars before he was bought by Moroka Swallows as a replacement for left winger Kgaogelo Sekgota.\nSolomons made his Premier Division breakthrough at Moroka Swallows. Manager Dylan Kerr converted him to right wing-back. Solomons was subsequently bought by Kaizer Chiefs in the summer of 2022. Sinky Mnisi, who was the CEO of Royal AM, made a minor stir by claiming that Royal AM already had agreed to buy the player from Swallows.\nSolomons was a Kaizer Chiefs regular during late 2022, but then found himself more often on the bench and suffered a dislocated shoulder in January 2023. During the 2023–24 season, he largely fell out of use. By March 2024 Solomons had not yet started a single game. Reeve Frosler and then Zitha Kwinika were preferred in the right back position.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nSolomons had his first child in 2023.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The Rockwood Historic District is a historic residential area in the Rockwood neighborhood on the south side of Spokane, Washington. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1997 due to the concentration of historic homes within the district as well as its significance in the areas of architecture, landscape architecture, and community planning and development.\nThe district, which at the time of its listing on the NRHP contained 297 contributing buildings along with 71 non-contributing buildings, stretches from roughly 10th Avenue in the north to 29th Avenue in the south, following Rockwood Boulevard and Garfield Road and extending approximately one block on either side of those two streets.\nMultiple architects were responsible for the design and construction of the numerous historic homes in the district, which reflect the Tudor Revival and Classical Revival styles as well as many other residential designs common to the first half of the 20th century. From 14th Avenue south, the Olmsted Brothers were responsible for the landscape design which incorporates curving streets, boulevards and parkways which contrast with the surrounding street grid.\n\n\n== Setting ==\nLocated in the Rockwood Neighborhood on Spokane's South Hill, the Rockwood Historic District follows Rockwood Boulevard from approximately 11th Avenue on the north as the boulevard winds its way along and up a steep basalt bluff. At around 21st Avenue Rockwood curves to the east and leaves the historic district, at that point Garfield Road continues up the final portion of the bluff and the historic district follows that road to 29th Avenue in the south.\n\nRockwood Boulevard enters the historic district at roughly 2,140 feet above sea level in the north. The elevation rises to approximately 2,340 feet at 29th Avenue on the southern boundary of the district. Rockwood Boulevard's curved path largely follows along the lower side of a steep bluff which winds across the area. Early neighborhood developer Jay P. Graves choose to embrace the terrain rather than view it as an obstacle, and as a result many of the district's oldest and grandest homes sit atop or immediately below the steep bluff, which in some places is a vertical cliff.\nFrom the northern end of the district to approximately 23rd Avenue, the terrain is quite hilly. From 23rd Avenue to the southern edge at 29th Avenue the elevation gain is much more gradual and the terrain is relatively flat compared to the northern portions of the district. Exposed basalt rock is common in the more rugged area north of 23rd Avenue, with less dramatic basalt outcroppings in the south along Rhyolite Road and Plateau Road. Many of the Ponderosa Pine and Douglas Fir trees in the area at the time of development were left in place and now form an extensive canopy over large portions of the historic district. Along the parkways and boulevards designed by the Olmsted Brothers, many species of Maple, Oak and Linden were planted in rows as shade trees.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe City of Spokane was formally incorporated in 1881 encompassing an area of 1.56 square miles that now comprises part of the downtown core. Part of what would become the Rockwood Historic District, specifically the area north of 14th Avenue and closest to the original city, was first incorporated into the city two years later in December 1883. The remainder of the current district was incorporated in April 1891.\nDevelopment of the area did not begin in earnest until around the turn of the century, when the northern portion of the district was replatted as part of the Rockwood Addition and Manito Park Second Addition in 1909. The first stage of major development lasted from 1908 through 1915 and the second took place between 1936 and 1942. During the first of those two periods, 64 homes were built with 21 in 1912 alone. During the latter period, 101 homes were built with a single-year high of 33 in 1939. Steady development also occurred between those two busier stages.\nSome of the earliest and grandest homes in the district were built along the bluff above Rockwood Boulevard which offered views of the city and surrounding areas including a 24-room Tudor Revival home for businessman August Paulsen and a Mission Style home secluded behind a stucco wall for district investor Frank Graves. Around this time and surrounding these homes, numerous other large homes were built in the Tudor Revival, American Craftsman, American Foursquare and Colonial Revival styles between 1910 and 1914.\n\nThere are two notable non-residential properties in the district, Hutton Elementary School and The Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist. Hutton Elementary, located at the intersection of Plateau Road and 24th Ave was built in a Spanish Eclectic style in 1921, with additional additions designed to match the original style were added in 1949. Those additions were removed during an expansion and modernization effort completed in 2015, but the original 1921 structure was left and subsequently added to the Spokane Historic Register. Construction on the English Gothic-style Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist in the far northwest end of the district began in 1925 and was completed in 1929, though further additions including the cathedral's iconic tower which is visible from locations around the city, continued until 1954.\nWorld War I slowed construction across the city, including in Rockwood, but picked up again after the war ended. In the decade which followed, over 70 homes were built in the district. It was in the years and decades which followed World War I that stonemason and architect John E. Anderson put his mark on the visual aesthetic of the neighborhood with the addition of Spanish Colonial-style homes. In the recovery from the Great Depression most of the remaining lots in the district were developed, with limited development occurring in the district in the decades since.\nOf the 350 homes in the district at the time of its listing on the NRHP in, 285 were built prior to 1950. Most of the non-contributing properties in the district, built after 1950, are clustered around the area of Crest Road and Crest Hill Drive. The few vacant plots remaining have proven challenging to build upon due to terrain considerations.\n\n\n== Historical images ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nRockwood, Spokane\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Spokane County, Washington\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The People's Front (Kurdish: بەرەی گەل, romanized: Bereyî Gel, is a political party in the Kurdistan Region that was founded by the former co-chair of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, Lahur Sheikh Jangi.\nThe party received its license from the interior ministry on 17 January 2024. On its founding congress in Erbil on 14 March 2024, about 160 members participated, electing  leadership council of 13 persons. The party claims \"serving the Kurdish people, freedom of opinion and civil rights\" as their core values, as well as equality and democracy.\nFor the 2024 Kurdistan Region parliamentary election,  Lahur Sheikh Jangi is heading the party's list in Silêmanî Governorate. Şaduman Mela Hesen, his close associate since before the PUK leadership crisis, is heading the list in Erbil Governorate. In Duhok Governorate, the ex-PUK member Zikrî Zêbarî is heading the list. In total, the party's list has 115 candidates, 56 of which in Silêmanî, 40 in Erbil, 17 in Duhok and 2 in Halabja. In total, 115 candidates are running for the People's Front.\nOther prominent candidates include Pêşrew Heme Can, brother of the ex-PUK politburo member Qadir Heme Can  and vice president of the University of Sulaimani. Also running for the People's Front is Ednan Usman, a former MP of the Gorran Movement, and Dr. Tiwana Mihemed Necm.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter the founder and leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, Jalal Talabani, died in 2017, a struggle for the leadership of the party ignited between Jalal's son Bafel Talabani and the then co-president Lahur Sheikh Jangi. On the PUK's fourth congress in December 2019, Sheikh Jangi received the most votes for the General Leadership Council. In a compromise, he and Bafel were proclaimed co-presidents. In July 2021, Bafel shut down a media outlet close to Sheikh Jangi and ousted several important commanders from the counter-terrorism and intelligence units of the PUK, who were seen as affiliates of him. Shortly after, Bafel was declared the sole leader of the party. In November, Lahur Sheikh Jangi was expelled from the PUK along a few others and Bafel took full control over the party's finances. Sheikh Jangi filed a lawsuit against the expulsion. In February 2023, a court in Erbil ruled, that the ouster from the co-presidency was contradicted PUK's internal regulation and reinstated him. A day after however, on February 21, the judicial authority on Iraqi elections in Baghdad declared Bafel Talabani the sole leader of the PUK. After that, Sheikh Jangi proceeded to work on founding his own party.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Thomas Vogt  (born 1958) is a German chemist and material scientist. He is an Educational Foundation Distinguished Professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of South Carolina.Vogt is most known for his work in structural chemistry, chemical synthesis, and structure-property correlations of metal oxides based on diffraction techniques using electrons, x-rays, and neutrons. He has authored and co-authored over 300 peer-reviewed journal articles and several books such as Solid State Materials Chemistry and Modelling Nanoscale Imaging in Electron Microscopy. He is the recipient of the 1996 R&D 100 award from R&D Magazine, the 2002 Design and Engineering Award of Popular Mechanics, the 2018 Carolina Trustee Professorship Award, and the 2019 USC Educational Foundation Award in Science, Mathematics and Engineering.Vogt is a Fellow of the American Physical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Neutron Scattering Society of America, as well as of the Institute of Advanced Study at Durham University and was a Founding Member of the editorial board for Physical Review Applied.\n\n\n== Education ==\nVogt earned a Diploma in Chemistry in 1985, followed by a PhD in 1987, both from the University of Tübingen.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter working at a European and US national laboratory (Institute Laue Langevin and Brookhaven National Laboratory), Vogt began an academic career at the Department of Philosophy at the University of South Carolina. He teaches The History and Philosophy of Chemistry in the South Carolina Honors College. Later he became a professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of South Carolina, where he has been the Educational Foundation Distinguished Professor since 2010.From 2005 to 2023, Vogt served as Director of the NanoCenter at the University of South Carolina and was Associate Vice President for Research from 2011-2013, and a member on the Board of Directors of the USC Research Foundation from 2008 to 2012. He was the co-chair of the Search Committee for Provost and Chief Academic Officer in 2019 and later a Pearce Faculty Fellow in the South Carolina Honors College from 2020 to 2022.Before joining the University of South Carolina, Vogt worked as a Scientist at the Institute Laue-Langevin, France until 1992, then joined Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) as an Associate Physicist, promoted to Physicist in 1995, and by 2000, he led the Powder Diffraction Group in BNL's Physics Department. From 2003 to 2005, he held various roles at BNL, including Head of Materials Synthesis and Characterization Group, Cluster Leader of Materials Synthesis in the Center for Functional Nanomaterials (CFN), and Technical Coordinator for scientific equipment in the CFN building project. Moreover, he led three startups,  Nanosource, LUMINOF and Sens4 as the Chief Technology Officer. He is a limited partner of TEXXMO mobile solutions, a wearable computer company and IOT button manufacturer.\n\n\n== Research ==\nVogt has conducted basic research using neutron, x-ray, and electron diffraction techniques to study structure-property relationships in materials, while also exploring philosophical and ethical implications of science and technology, particularly concerning the emergence of the periodic table of chemical elements. He holds 11 US patents such as the development of multidimensional integrated detection and analysis system (MIDAS) and neutron scintillating materials.\n\n\n=== Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) ===\nVogt investigated complex material structures using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). He helped develop new image simulation and modeling methodologies, such as super-resolution techniques, specialized de-noising methods, mathematical and statistical learning theories, and applications of compressed sensing, outlined in the book  Modelling Nanoscale Imaging in Electron Microscopy. In a review for Physics Today, Les J. Allen commented, \"In six chapters, the editors tackle the ambitious challenge of bridging the gap between high-level applied mathematics and experimental electron microscopy. They have met the challenge admirably... That work is also applicable to the new generation of x-ray free-electron lasers, which have similar prospective applications, and illustrates nicely the importance of applied mathematics in the physical sciences.\"Vogt and collaborators using STEM imaging with spherical aberration imaged the M1 phase, a MoVNbTe oxide partial oxidation catalyst, highlighting its potential applications in complex materials structure analysis. He also used the annular dark-field STEM to analyze nanoscale domains of complex oxide phases in disordered solids development. Furthermore, he and Douglas Blom employed parallel computing to analyze compositional disorder in a Mo, V-oxide bronze, highlighting discrepancies between experimental and simulated V content along metal-oxygen atomic columns, validated by HAADF-STEM imaging.\n\n\n=== Crystallography ===\nVogt used high-resolution neutron  diffraction techniques to investigate structural changes in molecules. Alongside Andrew N. Fitch and Jeremy K. Cockcroft, he revealed the low-temperature crystal structure of Rhenium heptafluoride (ReF7), confirming its molecular configuration as a distorted pentagonal bipyramid with Cs (m) symmetry. In another joint study published in Science, he observed negative thermal expansion in ZrW2O8, using diffraction to analyze its cubic structure.Using high-resolution neutron powder diffraction, Czjzek and Vogt located the hydrogen positions in zeolite Y. Subsequently, with Yongjae Lee, he examined structural changes in zeolites at high pressures, showing a pronounced rearrangement of non-framework metal ions and pressure-induced hydration/superhydration.\n\n\n=== Solid-state chemistry ===\nVogt's work on solid-state chemistry has focused on the temperature and pressure-dependent structural arrangements of materials. In 2021, he co-authored a textbook Solid State Materials Chemistry with Patrick M. Woodward, Pavel Karen and John S.O. Evans, covering structure, defects, bonding, and properties of solid state materials. He reported a spin ordering transition in oxygen-deficient YBaCo2O5, accompanied by structural changes and spin state alterations, marking the first observation of this phenomenon induced by long-range orbital and charge ordering. He collaborated on the characterization of a new solid electrolyte, Bi2La8[(GeO4)6]O3, identifying oxide ion interstitials as key to its ionic conductivity using advanced dark field electron microscopy. Furthermore, he investigated the cubic structure of CaCu3Ti4O12, a material with a large optical conductivity, ruling out ferroelectricity in favor of relaxor-like dynamics responsible for its giant dielectric effect.In a paper published in Nature Chemistry, Vogt and collaborators demonstrated the irreversible insertion and trapping of xenon in Ag-natrolite under moderate conditions, a possible explanation xenon deficiency in terrestrial and Martian atmospheres. He also observed water insertion into kaolinite at 2.7 GPa and 200 °C, shedding light on water release in subduction zones and its effects on seismicity and volcanic activity. Furthermore, his research showcased a pressure-driven metathesis reaction resulting in the formation of a water-free pollucite phase, CsAlSi2O6, with potential applications in nuclear waste remediation.Vogt and colleagues used advanced laser techniques to observe sub nanosecond structural dynamics of iron, revealing intricate wave patterns during compression and shock decay. He also examined the structural phase transitions in silicon 2D-nanosheets under high pressure, revealing size and shape-dependent behavior and the formation of 1D nanowires with reduced thermal conductivity.\n\n\n=== Phosphor materials for lighting ===\nVogt contributed to the development of white phosphors for fluorescent lighting. Together with Sangmoon Park, he developed a family of self-activating and doped UV phosphors for fluorescent white-light production. They also developed up-conversion phosphors emitting shorter-wavelength light in an ordered oxyfluoride compound.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n1996 – R&D 100 Award, R&D Magazine\n2002 – Design and Engineering Award, Popular Mechanics\n2018 – Carolina Trustee Professorship Award, USC\n2019 – Educational Foundation Award in Science, Mathematics and Engineering, USC\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\nModelling Nanoscale Imaging in Electron Microscopy (2012) ISBN 978-1461421900\nSolid State Materials Chemistry (2021) ISBN 978-0521873253\nComplex Oxides: An Introduction (2019) ISBN 978-9813278578\n\n\n=== Selected articles ===\nEvans, J.

        "content": "Edmundo González Urrutia is a Venezuelan opposition politician, diplomat and political analyst. He served as the Venezuelan ambassador to Argentina and Algeria. González also sits on the editorial board of El Nacional. He is currently a presidential candidate of the Unitary Platform political alliance for the 2024 Venezuelan presidential election.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nGonzález was born in La Victoria, Aragua in 1949. He received a degree in international studies from the Central University of Venezuela and a Master of Arts in international relations from the American University in 1981.\n\n\n== Diplomatic career ==\nGonzález began his diplomatic career working in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Venezuela. He lived in the United States in 1978, serving as a first secretary for the Venezuelan Ambassador to the United States.\nFrom 1991 to 1993, González served as the Venezuelan Ambassador to Algeria. He was the General Directorate of International Policy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 1994 to 1999. In late February 1999, González arrived in Argentina beside the newly inaugurated president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, receiving his credentials to serve as ambassador. While in Argentina, he promoted Venezuela's entry into Mercosur. His position as ambassador in Argentina ended in 2002.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nFrom 2013 to 2015, González was the international representative for the Venezuelan opposition's political alliance, the Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD).\nIn the 2020s, he became the president of the opposition's political alliance, the Unitary Platform, the successor of MUD. After the National Electoral Council (CNE) declared María Corina Machado–who won the 2023 Unitary Platform presidential primaries–ineligible for holding political office in the 2024 Venezuelan presidential election and Machado's alternate candidate Corina Yoris faced complications preventing her from filing her candidacy, González was entered as a Unitary Platform presidential candidate. On 26 March 2024, the CNE confirmed that González was a candidate for the 2024 presidential election.\n\n\n== References ==",

Rublev became the first defending champion to lose his opening match at the tournament since Novak Djokovic in 2016.\nDjokovic was attempting to become the first player to complete a triple career Golden Masters, but lost in the semifinals to Ruud. With his victory over Alex de Minaur in the quarterfinals, Djokovic reached his 77th career Masters 1000 semifinal, overtaking the previous record jointly held with Nadal. He also recorded the best career winning percentage in Masters history, with his latest win moving him to 82.24%, also bettering Nadal's 82.17%. Djokovic also equaled Nadal's consecutive 17-year streak (from 2005 to 2022) of reaching at least one ATP Masters 1000 semifinal per year.\nSumit Nagal became the first Indian player to qualify for the main draw since Ramesh Krishnan in 1982. His first round victory against Matteo Arnaldi made him the first Indian player to win a Masters 1000 singles match on clay. De Minaur became the first Australian player to reach the quarterfinals since Mark Philippoussis in 1999. Zhang Zhizhen became the first Chinese mainland player to both play the main draw and reach the second round.\n\n\n== Seeds ==\nThe top eight seeds received a bye into the second round. \n\nClick on the seed number of a player to go to their draw section.\n\n\n== Draw ==\n\n\n=== Key ===\n\n\n=== Finals ===\n\n\n=== Top half ===\n\n\n==== Section 1 ====\n\n\n==== Section 2 ====\n\n\n=== Bottom half ===\n\n\n==== Section 3 ====\n\n\n==== Section 4 ====\n\n\n== Qualifying ==\n\n\n=== Seeds ===\n\n\n=== Qualifiers ===\n\n\n=== Lucky losers ===\n\n\n=== Qualifying draw ===\n\n\n==== First qualifier ====\n\n\n==== Second qualifier ====\n\n\n==== Third qualifier ====\n\n\n==== Fourth qualifier ====\n\n\n==== Fifth qualifier ====\n\n\n==== Sixth qualifier ====\n\n\n==== Seventh qualifier ====\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMain draw\nQualifying draw",

        "content": "Hans Gustav Ferdinand Ramsay, from 1911 von Ramsay (Tinwalde, 18 May 1862 – Tanga, 14 January 1938) was an officer in the Imperial German Army and explorer of Africa.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter graduating from high school in Königsberg, Ramsay embarked on a military career and in 1882 became a second lieutenant in the Foot Artillery Regiment No. 11 in Thorn. In 1891 he was ordered to serve at the Foreign Office and then assigned to the Schutztruppe for German East Africa. In 1893 he was promoted to first lieutenant and in 1899 he was again assigned to the service at the Foreign Office under the position of the Schutztruppe. In 1900 he was given a statutory pension and permission to wear his previous uniform.\n\n\n== Activity in the colonies ==\nRamsay gained his first experiences in German East Africa. In 1886, before he was transferred to the local Schutztruppe, he accompanied the Denhardt brothers to Lamu and Wituland. From February 1889 he was an officer in the so-called Wissmanntruppe. In 1890 he was station chief in Bagamoyo, and from April 1891 district magistrate in Lindi. After his transfer to Kamerun, Ramsay succeeded Karl von Gravenreuth as head of the Cameroon Northern Expedition in 1892. For financial reasons, his engagement in Kamerun was not renewed in August 1892. Ramsay therefore moved back to East Africa in 1893 and worked as station chief in Kisaki in 1893, in Iringa and Ulanga in 1894, in Lindi in 1895 and from May 1896 as head of the Ujiji station he founded, the first German base on Lake Tanganyika. Numerous cartographic photographs of the lake area were taken here from 1896 to 1898, and in 1898/99 he was called back to work at the Foreign Office in Berlin.\nAfter leaving active military service in 1900, Ramsay took a position with the Northwest Kamerun Company (GNK), for which he managed business in Kamerun as general representative from 1901 to 1903. To explore and map the concession, he undertook several expeditions through the area between Cross River and Adamawa. Among other things, he is said to have been the first European to visit the Bamum Chiefdom on this occasion in July 1902. In 1906/07 he also made maps of the area of the Southern Kamerun Society (GSK) to determine the boundaries of the concession area.\n\n\n== Scientific work ==\nAfter returning to Germany again in 1907, Ramsay became a lecturer in regional studies of Kamerun and Togoland at the Seminar for Oriental Languages at the University of Berlin, at the same time began studying law and passed the traineeship exam in 1910. In 1912–1913 he stayed in Kamerun again as head of the border expedition (new eastern border). After World War I, Ramsay was mainly active in journalism and research, including as editor of the Notifications from the German Protected Areas and editor of the German Colonial Newspaper. In addition, from the summer semester of 1925, he again taught as a part-time, unscheduled lecturer at the Seminar for Oriental Languages and was a member of the expert commission of the Ethnological Museum of Berlin. In September 1937 he went on another study trip to East Africa, from which he never returned. He died in Tanga and was buried there.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nRamsay was a recipient of the silver Gustav Nachtigal Medal from the Berlin Geographical Society (1898). On 24 May 1911 he was raised to the Prussian nobility. In 1927 the Corps Saxonia Göttingen awarded him the Bierzipfel. He had been a member of the Berlin Masonic Lodge Zur Treue since 1922.\n\n\n== Publications ==\n(in German) Bericht des Leiters der Südkamerun-Hinterlandsexpedition H.

        "content": "Herbert Smagon (fl. 1927–2007) was a German soldier and painter.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHerbert Smagon was born on January 2, 1927, in Karviná in Czechoslovakia.\nIn 1937, due to the closure of German schools and an increasing atmosphere of anti-German sentiment, Smagon's family fled Czechoslovakia and settled in Berlin when he was 10 years old. Smagon's grandfather, a lithographer, introduced him to creative illustration at an early age, and he began taking art lessons at the age of 12.\nIn 1941, the Smagon family moved to Vienna in German-occupied Austria.\nIn 1943, Smagon was called into Luftwaffe service as a luftwaffenhelfer and was assigned to an auxiliary anti-aircraft unit. In the same year, he began his study at the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, attending lectures by Prof. Herbert Boeckl. Impressed by his artwork, Baldur von Schirach invited Smagon to an interview.\nIn 1947, Smagon returned to Allied-occupied Germany as an ethnic German refugee. After the war, he established himself in Stuttgart as an independent graphic designer. Between 1986 and 1997, works by Smagon were displayed in London and Turin.\nIn 1995, Smagon produced Wiedervereinigung (Reunification), also known as Der Fall der Berliner Mauer, an allegorical depiction of the fall of the Berlin Wall.\nSmagon's historical works included, among other things, images of Soviet troops raping and murdering children in Rössel, child soldiers at the Siege of Breslau, and German children burned alive on Wenceslas Square after the Prague uprising. Some of his works have generated controversy for depicting Allied war crimes during World War II. He described his historical artwork in the following way:\n\nI belong to the generation who witnessed the 20th century and the fate of the Germans. As a visual artist, I naturally feel compelled to artistically process the whole truth of the history I experienced, which is still kept as secret as possible today, and to bear witness to it for posterity.\n\n\n== See also ==\nReinhard Pozorny\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Archive of Herbert Smagon's website\".

He has served in the National Assembly of Serbia since February 2024 as a member of the Green–Left Front (ZLF).\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nRadovanović has a Bachelor of Laws degree. He was the director of a company in Sevojno for five years and afterward worked as a lawyer for Dunav auto. He lives in Požega.\n\n\n== Politician ==\nRadovanović was a founding member of the local Initiative for Požega (Inicijativa za Požegu, IZP) party in 2018. In 2021, Serbian prime minister Ana Brnabić accused the IZP of spreading false information about Serbian president Aleksandar Vučić's son; Radovanović later refuted this claim.\nThe IZP announced a co-operation agreement with Nebojša Zelenović's civic platform initiative (which later became the Akcija movement) in April 2021. Five IZP candidates later contested the 2022 Serbian parliamentary election as part of the We Must (Moramo) coalition electoral list. Radovanović was included in the eighty-sixth position and was not elected when the list won thirteen mandates.\nIn February 2023, Radovanović helped to bring the IZP into the Green–Left Front alliance at the republican level.\n\n\n=== Parliamentarian ===\nThe Green–Left Front took part in the 2023 Serbian parliamentary election as part of the Serbia Against Violence (SPN) coalition. Radovanović appeared in the sixty-fifth position on the coalition's list and was elected when the list won exactly sixty-five mandates. The Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) and its allies won a majority victory, and the ZLF serves in opposition.\nRadovanović is a member of the defence and internal affairs committee and a deputy member of the health and family committee, the committee on the rights of the child, and the committee on the judiciary, public administration, and local self-government.\n\n\n=== Municipal representative ===\nRadovanović led the IZP–ZLF into an alliance with the Democratic Party (DS) in Požega for the 2023 Serbian local elections, which took place concurrently with the parliamentary election. He led the resulting Požega Against Violence list and was elected when it won eleven seats. The SNS and its allies won the election, and Radovanović serves as an opposition deputy at the municipal level.\nIn February 2024, Radovanović called for a picture of Aleksandar Vučić to be removed from the municipal assembly.\n\n\n== References ==",

(also Johann Knijff or Joannes Knijff Ius, Utrecht,? – Groningen, 7 October 1576) was the first bishop of the Diocese of Groningen.\nHe was a Franciscan who had studied at Leuven. In 1561, he was appointed bishop of the newly established diocese of Groningen. He was consecrated bishop by Cardinal Granvelle in Brussels on 5 December 1563. Groningen resisted the arrival of a bishop. It was not until 1568 that Knijff, supported by Alva's troops, could take his diocese in the cathedral. In 1576, he died of the plague. Due to the fear of infection, the deceased bishop was buried quickly and without much ceremony in a free grave in the ambulatory east of the altar. Later, his remains were exhumed and placed in a crypt under the choir. Not a stone or a grave monument has been preserved.\nAlthough a successor was appointed after his death, Knijff was, in fact, the only bishop who exercised the office in Groningen until the re-establishment of the diocese in 1956.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The following is a list of unproduced Luca Guadagnino projects in roughly chronological order.\n\n\n== 2010s ==\n\n\n=== Rio ===\nIn May 2017, it was announced Guadagnino was attached to direct Rio from a screenplay by Steven Knight, with Benedict Cumberbatch and Jake Gyllenhaal to star.In November 2017, Michelle Williams joined the project.However, in a profile for The New Yorker, the timing did not work out and Guadagnino subsequently left the project.\n\n\n=== Swan Lake ===\nIn July 2017, Guadagnino signed up to direct a pitch from Kristina Lauren Anderson inspired by the classic ballet story Swan Lake, with Felicity Jones in the lead role. Several studios including Universal, Paramount and TriStar bid for the film rights to the project, which was described as a \"tentpole adaptation\" of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's ballet, that would follow the material closely.\n\n\n=== Call Me by Your Name sequel ===\nGuadagnino first alluded to doing a sequel to the film in November 2017,and confirmed in March 2018 he was working on the story with writer André Aciman.Timothee Chalamet would announce in October that same year he and Armie Hammer were intending to return for the sequel,and Guadagnino would approach Dakota Johnson for a role.In a March 2020 interview, Guadagnino reiterated that the film was set to be made, with Michael Stuhlbarg and Esther Garrel also set for role reprisals, however plans were put on hold as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.In May 2021, Guadagnino would cast doubts on the film being made as a result of his and Chalamet's other commitments, in addition to several abuse allegations being levied against Hammer.\n\n\n=== Burial Rites ===\nGuadagnino was set to direct Jennifer Lawrence in the film in December 2017.\n\n\n=== Blood on the Tracks ===\nGuadagnino announced in October 2018 that he was planning to turn Bob Dylan's album into a feature film, with Richard LaGravenese writing the screenplay.\n\n\n=== Lord of the Flies ===\nIn July 2019, Deadline Hollywood reported Guadagnino entered negotiations to direct a new adaptation of William Golding's novel.The project would find a screenwriter in April 2020, with Patrick Ness hired.No additional announcements were made on the project until September 2023, where producer Lindsey Anderson Beer would reveal Guadagnino was still involved.\n\n\n=== Suspiria sequel ===\nGuadagnino's 2018 film Suspiria, a remake of Dario Argento's 1977 film of the same name was initially set up to be part one of a series, with the title initially set to include Part One as a subtitle.However Guadagnino would ultimately rule out a sequel in November 2020 as a result of the first film's poor box office performance.\n\n\n== 2020s ==\n\n\n=== Scarface ===\nIn May 2020, Guadagnino was hired to direct a new version of Scarface for Universal Pictures, with Joel and Ethan Coen writing the screenplay.In November 2023, he would reveal he was no longer involved in the project.\n\n\n=== Scotty and the Secret History of Hollywood ===\nIn July 2020, it was announced Searchlight Pictures had acquired the rights to the documentary Scotty and the Secret History of Hollywood and was developing a feature film based on Bowers life. Guadagnino was hired to direct, with Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg writing the script.\n\n\n=== Wartime Lies ===\nIn September 2020, it was reported that Guadagnino hoped to direct a film based on Louis Begley's Holocaust novel Wartime Lies,and that he had examined Stanley Kubrick's papers on the project, held at the Stanley Kubrick Archive at University of the Arts London.\n\n\n=== Brideshead Revisited miniseries ===\nIn November 2020, the BBC was reported to be adapting Evelyn Waugh's novel with Guadagnino set to write and direct, and Ralph Fiennes, Cate Blanchett and Andrew Garfield named as potential members of the cast.Guadagnino would confirm the cast, in addition to Harry Lawtey and Rooney Mara, in September 2022, but revealed that as a result Guadagnino needing $110 million to make the series and not being able to compromise on this, BBC and HBO would shelve the project.\n\n\n=== Audrey Hepburn biopic ===\nIt was announced in January 2022 that Apple Studios had entered development with Guadagnino on a Audrey Hepburn biopic, with Rooney Mara cast to star as Hepburn.Filming had been slated to begin in late 2023,however Mara would announce in February 2024 that Guadagnino had exited the project.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLuca Guadagnino's unrealized projects at IMDb",

        "content": "\"7 Minute Drill\" is a diss track written and recorded by the American rapper J. Cole for his fourth mixtape, Might Delete Later (2024). It is his response to fellow American rapper Kendrick Lamar's diss verse on his single \"Like That\" (with American rapper Future and American record producer Metro Boomin).\nProduced by T-Minus, Conductor Williams, Al Hug and Elyas, the track was titled after and taken from one of Cole's seven-minute songwriting drills with the former producer. Music critics were polarized by \"7 Minute Drill\", as they feel that it was a restrained and subpar response to Lamar's verse.\nTwo days after the song was released, Cole retracted his diss and issued a public apology to Lamar. His actions further divided critics; some were disappointed and believed that it left a stain on his reputation, while others commended him for prioritizing his mental health over competition. Cole later pulled the song from music streaming services.\n\n\n== Background and composition ==\nJ. Cole was featured on Drake's single \"First Person Shooter\", released on October 6, 2023, from the latter's eighth studio album For All the Dogs. During his verse, Cole supported the idea that he, Drake, and Kendrick Lamar make up the \"Big Three\" of modern rap music. Six months later, Lamar responded to \"First Person Shooter\" through a surprise appearance on Future and Metro Boomin's single \"Like That\", from their collaborative album We Don't Trust You (2024), where he dismissed Cole's \"Big Three\" remark and claimed that he alone rules the rap scene. Although the majority of his diss verse was aimed at Drake, it also featured a few \"warning jabs\" aimed at Cole.\nT-Minus, who produced \"7 Minute Drill\" alongside Conductor Williams, told Complex that Cole enjoys doing songwriting drills, consisting of him \"writ[ing] a joint for seven minutes and see[ing] how far he can get.\" The method, according to his manager Ibrahim Hamad, is his way of \"breaking out of overthinking.\" After \"Like That\" was released, Cole and T-Minus met at a recording studio to work on a writing drill. The latter artist kicked off the challenge by producing a beat via FL Studio within the seven-minute timeframe. Before Cole headed to a separate room to complete his portion of the drill, he asked T-Minus to give him a word to start with. He suggested \"light\" after noticing the word on his workstation. When his seven minutes were up, Cole left the room and told T-Minus, \"just give me another seven minutes. I think I've got something going,\" ultimately resulting in \"7 Minute Drill.\" Rolling Stone thought that the title was a reference to military exercises where officials discuss how to respond to an enemy threat.\n\n\n== Lyrics ==\n\"7 Minute Drill\" is Cole's \"lyrical exercise\" in response to Lamar's verse on \"Like That\". He begins by comparing Lamar's career trajectory to the Simpsons (1989–present); despite being the longest-running American animated series in history, critics and audiences have noticed a \"waning quality\" with its recent seasons. Cole elaborates on the comparison by evaluating Lamar's discography:\n\nYour first shit [2012's Good Kid, M.A.A.D City] was classic, your last shit [2022's Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers] was tragic / Your second shit [2015's To Pimp a Butterfly] put niggas to sleep, but they gassed it / Your third shit [2017's Damn] was massive and that was your prime / I was trailin' right behind and I just now hit mine\nEven though Lamar's debut studio album is Section.80 (2011), publications interpreted that the dig began with Good Kid, M.A.A.D City as it is his first album under a major record label. Cole continues the verse by throwing backhanded compliments and \"light\" jabs at his \"brother\" instead of hard insults, alluding his conflicted feelings to Nino Brown killing Gerald \"Gee Money\" Wells in the crime film New Jack City (1991). Complex's Jordan Rose, in his breakdown of \"7 Minute Drill\", suggests that he \"doesn’t want to fully commit to dissing [Lamar] because they’ve been cordial up until this point.\"\nThe second half of the song takes aim at Lamar's small stature (\"Your arms might be too short to box with the God\") and sparse release schedule (\"He averagin' one hard verse like every thirty months or somethin' [...] Four albums in 12 years, nigga, I can divide\"). The latter lines are direct parallels to Jay-Z's 2001 song \"Takeover\", a diss track aimed at Nas and Prodigy of Mobb Deep. Cole closes the song by saying, \"This is merely a warning shot to back niggas down,\" which Rose took as him \"indulging in this lyrical warfare simply because he loves the sport of rap competition, rather than because he has any real malice in his heart for his opponent.\"\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\"7 Minute Drill\" polarized music critics, most of whom considered the song to be a weak response to \"Like That\". They also found it ironic that Cole claimed Lamar's work put listeners to sleep, considering his own discography was also criticized and turned into Internet memes for its alleged \"sleepy\" nature.\nAndre Gee of Rolling Stone wrote that if \"7 Minute Drill\" is in fact a reference to military deliberation, maybe the command decision should've been to stand down and not say anything at all.\" He acknowledged Cole taking a sensible and measured approach to competition, but argued that rap beefs are a \"toxic, nonsensical arena\" and its fans want artists to \"take it all the way there, not be overly conscientious and almost deferential on the battlefield.\" Writing for Billboard, Angel Diaz felt that the song alluding to New Jack City was accurate as Cole sounded restrained. He believed he fired a \"shot in the air\" instead of a \"headshot like most expected,\" ultimately deeming his retort was not enough.\nPitchfork's Alphonse Pierre found \"7 Minute Drill\" to be an \"even more boring\" addition to an \"already boring\" feud, with heavy criticisms towards Cole's \"worn\" delivery, camp counselor-esque disses and cheap production. He concludes that the song \"feels less like a diss track and more like the sad, conflicted texts you send after a breakup, when you still have a little hope that, one day, eventually, you will be back together like none of this ever happened.\" In a more positive review, Clash's Robin Murray felt the production was \"slightly out-of-step\" with Might Delete Later, but \"it taps into some of the project’s over-arching themes—self-worth, separating talent from hype—and feels more ingrained, really, than [Lamar]’s own bars on the hit ‘n’ miss Metro Boomin and Future tape.\"\n\n\n== Apology and removal ==\nOn April 7, 2024, two days after \"7 Minute Drill\" was released, Cole headlined his annual Dreamville Festival in his native North Carolina. He addressed the crowd towards the end of his performance in a six-minute speech, where he stressed the importance of the forthcoming song \"Love Yourz\" and reflected on Might Delete Later. Cole was \"so proud\" of the mixtape, as it served as a lead-up to his upcoming studio album The Fall Off, but there was one part that he felt was \"the lamest shit I did in my fucking life.\" He admitted he was \"conflicted\" about \"7 Minute Drill\" for two reasons: the respect he has for Lamar and Drake, and the general public wanting bloodshed. Neither motive \"sat right\" with Cole's spirit and \"disrupt[ed] my fucking peace.\"\nCole further confessed that he tried looking for an angle to justify downplaying Lamar's catalog and his \"greatness\". He asked the audience if they thought Lamar is \"one of the greatest motherfuckers to ever touch a fucking microphone\" and love him like he does. Cole then formally apologized to Lamar for \"moving incorrectly\" and prayed that he \"didn't feel no way\" and that \"God will line me back up on my purpose and on my path.\" He gave Lamar permission to diss him back if he was offended by the song.\nCole hoped that the audience forgave him for the \"misstep\" and vowed to remove \"7 Minute Drill\" from music streaming services. Five days later, he upheld his commitment and pulled the song from streaming services such as Spotify, Apple Music and Tidal.\n\n\n=== Reception ===\nIn an opinion piece for Business Insider, Sowmya Krishnamurthy felt that Cole's apology ignored the genre's foundational roots in competition and Black oral traditions. \n\n\n== Personnel ==\nMusicians\n\nJermaine Cole – lead artist, vocals, songwriter, composer\nTyler Williams – production, composer\nDenzel “Conductor” Williams – production, composer\nHug \"Al Hug\" Alessandro – production\nElias \"Elyas\" Sticken – production\nTechnical\n\nJoe LaPorta – mastering\nMez – mixing\nKuldeep Chudasama – recording\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Paul A. Thompson of Pitchfork wrote that in the song, \"Cole begins by approximating Juelz Santana's style (spare, epigrammatic), then ratchets up the pace and word count. There is an indelible quality to the best Juelz verses that few rappers could ever replicate, but this is one of Cole's best showings on Might Delete Later—and recalls certain stretches of To Pimp a Butterfly, where Kendrick grafted more syllables onto airy P-funk beats than many of that style's originators ever had.\"\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Produced by T-Minus, it is a diss track toward American rapper Future and response to his, Metro Boomin and Kendrick Lamar's song \"Like That\", on which Lamar had dissed Cole.\n\n\n== Background ==\nJ. Cole previewed the song in a social media vlog titled \"Might Delete Later, Vol. 1\" on February 21, 2024.\n\n\n== Composition and lyrics ==\n\"Crocodile Tearz\" utilizes an \"eerie Memphis-leaning beat\" that has been described as reminiscent of the song \"Knife Talk\" by Drake featuring 21 Savage, as well as \"mournful sonics\" while J. Cole uses a direct tone in his lyrics, in which he emphasizes his status as among the best rappers in the modern hip-hop world. In addition, he takes subliminal shots at Future \"Yes, sir, it's me, not two, not three / The uno, G-O-A-T, I need my fee, fuck kudos / G4 at least, these flights ain't cheap as you know / They sound faded, they downgraded, they Pluto / I'm bigger than Mars, this nigga a star, I'm Bruno\".\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nPaul A. Thompson of Pitchfork praised J. Cole's performance, describing him as \"rapping through his teeth in a way that makes him sound more composed and more menacing than nearly ever before\". Aron A. of HotNewHipHop stated that \"Might Delete Later isn't a body of work that aims to do much else besides wreak lyrical tyranny on the rest of hip-hop and make it clear where he stands among the crowd\", before writing \"It's best summarized on 'Crocodile Tearz,' a fiery banger that's filled a cut-throat performance from Cole\".\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jürgen Sturm is a German software engineer, entrepreneur and academic. He is a Senior Staff Software Engineering Manager at Intrinsic, where he works on developing a robot SDK aimed at facilitating and reducing the cost of integrating AI-/ML-powered robots into industrial manufacturing processes.Sturm is most known for his work on robotics, computer vision, machine learning and artificial intelligence. He has authored and co-authored research articles and a book entitled Approaches to Probabilistic Model Learning for Mobile Manipulation Robots. He is the recipient of the 2011 European Coordinating Committee of Artificial Intelligence (ECCAI) Best Dissertation Award, the 2011 Wolfgang-Gentner Award for an Outstanding PhD Thesis, the TeachInf Best Lecture Award from the Technical University of Munich in 2012 and 2013 for his course Visual Navigation for Flying Robots, and is listed among the most influential robotics scholars in 2022 by Technical University of Munich by AMiner.\n\n\n== Education and early career ==\nSturm earned his bachelor's and master's degrees in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Amsterdam in 2006, followed by a PhD in Robotics from the University of Freiburg, with his later thesis published as a book in 2013. From 2011 to 2014, he served as a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Computer Vision group at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), where he worked on real-time camera tracking and 3D person scanning methods. Concurrently, he began his academic career, delivering lectures at TUM and teaching an online course at EdX in 2012 and 2013.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAt TUM, Sturm developed a 3D reconstruction algorithm enabling 3D scanning of a person for printing as a small figure, leading to him co-founding the 3D scanning startup FabliTec in 2013, where he served as CEO until 2015. In 2014, he joined Metaio as a Senior Software Developer and Team Lead. Subsequently, he was appointed Senior Software Engineer and Tech Lead Manager at Google. leading to multiple patents. He assumed the position of an Engineering Manager at Intrinsic in 2019.\n\n\n== Research ==\nSturm has contributed to the field of engineering by studying robotics, machine intelligence and machine perception, holding several patents for his developments in RGB-D cameras and 3D mapping techniques.\n\n\n=== RGB-D SLAM ===\nSturm has researched and worked on RGB-D cameras throughout his career. In a collaborative effort, he presented a benchmark for RGB-D SLAM systems, offering high-quality image sequences with accurate ground truth camera poses, diverse scenes, and automatic evaluation tools accessible through a dedicated website. He also proposed a dense visual SLAM method for RGB-D cameras, alongside Daniel Cremers and Wolfram Burgard, improving pose accuracy by minimizing errors. Additionally, he showcased an RGB-D camera SLAM system for the Microsoft Kinect, assessing its accuracy, robustness, and speed across different indoor scenarios and offering it as open-source software.\n\n\n=== 3D mapping ===\nSturm's work on 3D mapping focused on reconstruction and improving techniques for precision. Alongside colleagues, he demonstrated a mapping system using RGB-D cameras for accurate 3-D mapping. He also introduced a real-time mapping system for RGB-D images using an octree structure to update a textured triangle mesh, enabling efficient memory usage for mobile or flying robots, as well as a new real-time visual odometry method for monocular cameras, achieving superior accuracy and speed by continuously estimating a semi-dense inverse depth map. Furthermore, he presented a 3D reconstruction algorithm based on Truncated Signed Distance Functions (TSDF), addressing the challenge of representing dynamic environments for robots, with a focus on continuous refinement of static maps and robust scene differencing.In a joint research effort, Sturm proposed a graph-based method to calibrate sensor suites for accurate direct georeferencing of images from small unmanned aerial systems, addressing static offsets and in-flight calibration of intrinsic camera parameters.\n\n\n=== 3D perception ===\nSturm has been involved in the development of models for 3D perception and scanning as well. He presented ScanComplete, a data-driven method using a generative 3D CNN model to predict complete 3D models with semantic labels from incomplete scans. In addition, he revealed a real-time RGB-D scene understanding method for mobile devices, combining incremental reconstruction, geometric segmentation, and semantic labeling.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2011 – Best Dissertation Award, European Coordinating Committee of Artificial Intelligence (ECCAI)\n2011 – Wolfgang-Gentner-Award for an Outstanding PhD Thesis, University of Freiburg\n2012 –  Best Research Paper Award, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle in Geomatics\n2012, 2013 – TeachInf Best Lecture Award, Technical University of Munich\n2022 – Most Influential Robotics Scholar\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\nApproaches to Probabilistic Model Learning for Mobile Manipulation Robots (2013) ISBN 978-3642371592\n\n\n=== Selected articles ===\nEndres, F., Hess, J., Engelhard, N., Sturm, J., Cremers, D., & Burgard, W.

        "content": "The Ae Kanga ruins阿恵官衙遺跡 (Ae Kanga iseki) is an archaeological site with the ruins of an Asuka to Nara period government administrative complex located in what is now the town of Kasuya in Fukuoka prefecture in northern Kyushu, Japan. The site has been protected as a National Historic Site from 2020.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nIn the Asuka period to Nara period, after the establishment of a centralized government under the Ritsuryō system, local rule over the provinces was standardized under a kokufu (provincial capital), and each province was divided into smaller administrative districts, known as  (郡, gun, kōri), composed of two to 20 townships in 715 AD. Each of the units had an administrative complex, or kanga (官衙遺跡) built on a semi-standardized layout based on contemporary Chinese design, similar to that of the kokufu, but on a much smaller scale. With a square layout or rectangular layout, each had office buildings for administration, taxation, and security, as well as granaries for tax rice and other taxable produce. In the periphery there was typically a Buddhist temple with some official standing. This system collapsed with the growth of feudalism in the Late Heian period, and the location of many of the kanga is now lost.\nThe Ae Kanga ruins are located near the coast of Hakata Bay and were discovered during excavations from 2013 to 2016 at the Haramachi Farm attached to the Faculty of Agriculture, Kyushu University. The ruins consist of the foundations of the government office complex itself, a warehouse complex for storing tax rice, and an ancient road, which were found in good condition. Artifacts include ink stones, which were used by officials. In 2023, the remains of one of the largest pit dwellings in the prefecture were discovered across from the site. From these remains, it is believed that this site was the remains of the kanga constructed in the late 7th century to 8th century as the headquarters of \"Kasuya no kōri\" which appears in ancient records. The name also appears in the inscription on a bell dated 698, which is in the possession of Myōshin-ji in Kyoto. The inscription also gives the name of the \"kōri-no-miyatsuko\" at the time, a man named \"Hirokuni\", who would have worked at the Ae Kanga. This is one of the few instances were the name of an Asuka period local administrator is known. \n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKasuya Town home page (in Japanese)\nCultural Properties of Fukuoka Prefecture (in Japanese)",

        "content": "Tachikawa Sumito (立川清登) (February 15, 1929 – December 31, 1985) was a Japanese baritone singer and radio host. At first a singer of opera and lieder, his repertoire later included musicals and popular music. In addition to being a performing musician, he was also a radio host and television personality.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life and education ===\nTachikawa was born on February 15, 1929, in Ōita, Ōita Prefecture. His interest in singing began when his elementary school's music teacher praised his talent. Consequently, Tachikawa later enrolled at the Ōita Normal School in order to become a music teacher. Although he taught music at a junior high school after graduation, he maintained his ambition to become a professional singer. After being advised by a colleague to pursue music full-time, Tachikawa resigned his job and enrolled in music studies at Beppu Prefectural High School No. 2. He moved to Tokyo after graduation and transferred to the Kunitachi College of Music, where he became a student of Nakayama Teiichi. The following year, Tachikawa was admitted into Tokyo University of the Arts and studied under Margarete Julia Netke-Löwe; he graduated with degrees in vocal music and performance in 1954 and 1955 respectively.\nTachikawa was one of the founding members of Nikikai, a volunteer organization for singers, in 1952.\n\n\n=== Professional singer ===\nIn 1953, Tachikawa sang in his first operatic performance as a chorus member for his school's performance of La bohème. That same year, he made his professional debut as Germont in a production of La traviata at the Asahi Kaikan in Osaka. In 1955, he was signed onto Nippon Victor, for whom he was an exclusive artist for the rest of his life. His repertoire quickly expanded, with his interpretations of Papageno in The Magic Flute, Le Dancaïre in Carmen, and Figaro in The Barber of Seville earning him exceptional praise; the latter role won him the 1958 Mainichi Music Prize.\nIn 1962, Tachikawa began to sing lieder in recital. He also began to expand his career into musicals. His performance as the King of Siam in The King and I earned him a Theatron Award in 1965. That same year, he was chosen to be one of the soloists for the Japanese premiere of Benjamin Britten's War Requiem played by the Yomiuri Nippon Symphony Orchestra.\n\n\n=== Broadcasting career ===\nIn addition to singing, Tachikawa also had a successful career as host for radio and television programs. In January 1960, he became the host for NHK's Ongaku o dōzo (lit. 'Music, If You Please'). Later, between 1968 and 1974, he was the main host of Sekai no ongaku (lit. 'Music of the World'); he later worked on this program with Sagara Naomi.\nHis recording of \"My Grandfather's Clock\" became an enduring source of fame for Tachikawa and established the song as a classic of Japanese popular culture when it was broadcast on the NHK children's program, Minna no uta. It first aired on June and July 1962, accompanied by an animated sequence created by Taniuchi Rokurō. The song quickly became well known across Japan and has been incorporated into educational settings ever since. A second version, utilizing the same recording, but with a new animated sequence by Takeguchi Yoshiyuki was broadcast on Minna no uta in 1972.\nTachikawa appeared four times in the Kōhaku Uta Gassen.\n\n\n=== Later life ===\nTachikawa's LPs were popular in the 1960s and 1970s. He had a major hit in 1976 with his cover of \"Shiki no uta\" (lit. 'Song of the Four Seasons'). He discovered the song during his tenure as host of the Nippon Broadcasting System radio show, Aozora Wide. A housewife called into the show with a request to hear the \"Shiki no uta\". Unfamiliar with the song, he asked her to sing it for him over the air, and was impressed by its melody.\nMusic education remained an interest for Tachigawa, who held the position of visiting professor at Senzoku Gakuen.\nIn 1985, Tachikawa sung the \"Kimi ga yo\" at Madison Square Garden. He sang in performances in the early part of that year that were part of a Japanese anti-nuclear campaign. That summer, he embarked on a tour of Europe, which included a performance in the Vatican City and an audience with Pope John Paul II. Late in the year, he appeared in a new production of The Merry Widow and began preparing for what would have been his debut as an opera director.\n\n\n=== Death and legacy ===\nOn December 10, 1985, Tachikawa collapsed from a stroke during a performance at a hotel in Yonago, Tottori Prefecture. Emergency surgery led to a brief recovery, but his condition soon worsened and he died on December 31.\nIn reminiscences for a 2012 memorial 5-CD collection of his recordings, Sagara eulogized her former colleague:\n\nAllow me to say this: there is nobody in the world of [Japanese] classical music who is as big a star as Mr. Tachikawa was. We lost a truly, truly incredible person. I do not think there will ever be another to surpass him. I cannot help but feel that if we do not start from scratch and create the soil in which natural talent can be utilized, then the music world as a whole will cease to create anything genuine.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nAnonymous. \"立川清登\" [Tachikawa Sumito].

He studied in Leuven and Orléans and is said to have obtained a doctorate in law in Italy. From 1508 to 1558, he was canon of St. Salvator's in Utrecht, where he would also become vice dean and treasurer. He was also a counselor to the Bishop of Liège Robert van Mons. Ruysch maintained a relationship with Maria Claes Weymansdr, daughter of the glassmaker Claes Weyman. Three children were born from this relationship.\nRuysch, together with Bishop of Utrecht George van Egmond and his then vicar Nicolaas van Nieuwland, was involved in the arrangement that the regulars of Stein - after the fire in 1549 that destroyed their monastery - could move into the monastery in 1551. Brigitte Monastery on the Raam in Gouda. A few years later, in 1556, he would also be the donor of a glass for the newly built chapel of the monastery. The stained glass from this monastery was transferred to St. John's Church in Gouda in 1580. Since 1934, this has been one of the glasses in the Van der Vorm Chapel of this church. It concerns the representation of Jesus shown to the people by Pilate, ecce homo. The glass was designed by Dirk Crabeth and made by one or more of his employees. Ruysch is depicted as the donor of this glass at the bottom.\nRuysch was also involved, together with Herman Lethmaet, in raising funds for the manufacture of the new stained glass in the St. John's Church in Gouda.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nBosch, RA, The 72 glasses of the Sint Janskerk in Gouda, Delft, 2008.\nBogaers, Llewellyn The Religious Passion of Dirck Weyman in Jaarboek Oud Utrecht, 1993.\nDolder-de Wit, Henny van, Gouda monasteries in the Middle Ages (10): The Birgitten and the double monastery Mariënsterre, in Tidinge van Die Goude, volume 17 no. 3, July 1999.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Tanabataike Kofun (七夕池古墳)  is a Kofun period burial mound, located in the Tabomi neighborhood of the town of  Shime,  Kasuya District,Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. The tumulus was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1975, with the area under protection expanded in 2001.  \n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Tanabataike Kofun is located at the tip of a small hill that extends on the right bank of the upper reaches of the Umi River, which flows into Hakata Bay, and is located approximately 300 meters across a narrow valley to the north of Kōshōji Kofun.  It borders a reservoir called Tanabata Pond, from which it is named. It was discovered during the construction of a residential area in 1972. The tumulus is an  enpun (円墳)-style circular tumulus approximately 29 meters in diameter and 3.7 meters in height, and was constructed in three stages. The fukiishi is largely intact. The burial facility is a vertical pit-style stone burial chamber made of river stones, and is only about 1.8 meters long.  There are traces of a wooden coffin being placed inside the burial chamber, and the short side panels of the wooden coffin were inserted into the ground, and a woman in her 40s or 50s was buried inside. Grave goods such as a small full-length bronze  mirror, kotohashira-shaped stone products, an iron sword, and more than 3500 beads. Iron utensils,  magatama beads, and Haji ware pottery were unearthed outside the coffin. From these artifacts, the tumulus is thought to have been built between the end of the 4th century and the beginning of the 5th century.  \nThe site was opened as a park in 1972.  Later, when the privately-owned land on the east side of the burial mound was excavated in 1999, a 3.65 meter wide moat was confirmed, and this area was additionally designated in 2001.Artifacts excavated are displayed at the Shime Town Historical Materials Room.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Tanabataike Kofun at Wikimedia Commons\n\nShime home page(in Japanese)\nFukuoka Tourism Web(in Japanese)",

In her he was present at the battle of Trafalgar, and in 1809 at the operations on the coast of Italy. In December 1809 he was promoted to be lieutenant of the Canopus, still on the coast of Italy, and being invalided from her in the following year, was in September 1811 appointed to the Kite sloop, employed in the North Sea, and afterwards in the Mediterranean. On her paying off, in December 1814, he was appointed to the Leveret on the home station, but in July 1815 was placed on half-pay. Seeing no probability of further employment, and having friends in Calcutta, he went thither in 1817, and obtained command of the ship Prince Blucher, in which he made two voyages to England. In 1821 he attempted to establish a sailors' home at Calcutta; it failed, but Johnston was brought under the favourable notice of the Marquis of Hastings, who appointed him marine storekeeper, and, before he could enter on the duties, commissioner of the court of requests; but Johnston returned to England to arrange his private affairs, and never filled either office. He then turned his attention to steam navigation, and drew up a proposal for establishing steam communication with India viâ the Mediterranean and Red Sea. In 1823 he returned to India to lay his plans before the governor-general. They were not accepted, and Johnston, returning to England, was appointed to the Enterprise, a private steam-vessel, in which he made the passage to India round the Cape of Good Hope, and arrived at Calcutta in December 1825. The steamer was immediately purchased for the company's service, and sent on to Burma, but not till after the conclusion of the war. In 1829 Johnston was desired to report on the practicability of establishing steam navigation on the Ganges, and after surveying the river was ordered to England to confer with the court of directors. His plans were approved, and for many years the navigation of the Ganges was carried on in iron steamers built after his design. Returning to India in 1833, he was appointed controller of the company's steamers, which post he held till 1850. On his passage home after retirement, he died on 5 May 1851. He was married, and left issue.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1892). \"Johnston, James Henry\".

        "content": "Peter O'Higgins O.P. (c.1602 – 24 March 1642, St Stephen's Green, County Dublin, Ireland) was an Irish Dominican priest who was hanged outside the walls of Dublin, officially for high treason against King Charles I but in reality as part of the religious persecution of the Catholic Church in Ireland that began under King Henry VIII and ended only with Catholic Emancipation in 1829. Fr. O'Higgins was Beatified by Pope John Paul II on 22 September 1992 as one of the 24 officially recognized Irish Catholic Martyrs.\n\n\n== Life ==\nO'Higgins is believed to have been born at Tipper, near Naas, County Kildare. He was educated secretly in Ireland and later in Spain. He may have been ordained at Lisbon on 21 December 1624 and he appears in a list of Irish Dominicans resident in the Spanish Empire as of 1627.\nWith the accession of King Charles I in 1625, a limited religious toleration was granted and Peter O'Higgins came back to Dublin and was assigned to re-open the Dominican friary in Naas, supported by the Viceroy Strafford who was building Jigginstown Castle nearby. Instead, the 1641 rebellion, a rising of the Irish clans of Ulster and led by Felim O'Neill of Kinard, sought to reverse the Plantation of Ulster, the mass evictions of their fellow Gaels, and the religious persecution of the Catholic Church in Ireland, while claiming to be acting under orders from King Charles I. \nBelieving that Tudor and Stuart religious persecution was finally at an end, the Catholics of Dublin ejected all Church of Ireland clergy from the Pre-Reformation St Patrick's Cathedral, which was then reconsecrated, followed by a Solemn High Mass. According to the Venetian Ambassador, Catholics in the rest of the British Isles were terrified by this move, as they feared, correctly, that it would make the religious persecution of Catholics worse rather than better. \nSimilarly, instead of actually solving anything, Felim O'Neill's rising marked the beginning of years of escalating warfare with no quarter given between Catholics and Protestants, Puritans and Anglicans, and finally Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army against both Anglican and Catholic Royalists. According to historian D.P. Conyngham, \"Ireland was torn by contending factions, and was oppressed by two belligerents during the reign of Charles... Charles, with the proverbial fickleness of the Stuarts, when pressed by the Puritans, persecuted the Irish, while he encouraged them when he hoped their loyalty and devotion would be the means of establishing his royal prerogative. It is ever thus with Ireland... For eight years Ireland was the theatre of the most desolating war and implacable persecution.\"\nDuring the rising, Rev. Dr. William Pilsworth, Church of Ireland Vicar of Donadea, was arrested by rebel soldiers and was about to be hanged, when Fr. Peter O'Higgins stepped forward. Dr. Pilsworth later wrote that when he was on the gallows, \"a priest whom I never saw before, made a long speech on my behalf saying that this...was a bloody inhuman act that would...draw God's vengeance on them.  Whereupon I was brought down and released.\"\nMeanwhile, the Portadown massacre and other recent sectarian violence against Protestants were being both exaggerated and weaponized for what is now called atrocity propaganda. Furthermore, the Irish Royal Army was retaliating with systematic raids and sectarian massacres of their own against both real and imagined Catholics. By the time they recaptured Naas in February 1642, the officers and enlisted men of the Irish Royal Army and many participating clergy of the Church of Ireland made no distinction in their own ethnic cleansing between age, gender, or even between Irish language-speaking Catholics and the traditionally Royalist Old English population of Fingal, County Wicklow, County Kildare, and the Pale.\nAn understandably terrified Fr. Peter O'Higgins accordingly sought the protection of the Earl of Ormond, who ordered him delivered to Dublin under the protection of Royalist cavalry. The fury of Anglican Royalists towards all Catholics and especially priests, however, was so intense that Ormonde's cavalry, under the command of Sir Thomas Armstrong, had to fight a pitched battle against Ormonde's infantrymen, who demanded in vain that Fr. Peter O'Higgins be surrendered to them. Despite further efforts by Ormonde to protect him, O'Higgins instead fell into the hands of Sir Charles Coote, the infamously anti-Catholic Governor of Dublin.\nUpon his arrival in Dublin Castle on 3 February, O'Higgins was imprisoned under terrible conditions. Seeking to save his life, the Earl of Ormond gathered many petitions, of which at least twenty still survive, from Protestants relating how Fr. O'Higgins had saved their lives from sectarian violence and ethnic cleansing and imploring that his life be spared in return. By 13 February, Sir Charles Coote had arranged for the testimony of a witness who alleged that Fr. O'Higgins had called for massacres of Protestants, and on 27 April Higgins was outlawed for high treason. The weakness of the evidence was such, though, that O'Higgins was not charged with a crime and was instead sentenced to death by hanging under martial law.\n\n\n== Death ==\nOn the eve of the his execution, Peter O'Higgins was offered his life, a full pardon for high treason, and high preferment in the State-controlled Church of Ireland by Sir Charles Coote if he would renounce his faith. O'Higgins said he would do so only if these verbal promises were first committed to a written and signed document.\nOn 24 March 1642, a great crowd gathered around the gallows in St Stephen's Green, then outside the walls of Dublin, expecting to see a Catholic priest renounce the Catholic religion. But when Sir Charles Coote's full pardon was given to him, Fr. Peter O'Higgins instead announced to the crowd, \"The sole reason why I am condemned to death to-day is that I profess the Catholic religion. Here is an authentic proof of my innocence: the autograph letter of the Viceroy offering me very rich rewards and my life if I abandon the Catholic religion. I call God and man to witness that I firmly and unhesitatingly reject these offers and willingly and gladly I enter into this conflict, professing that Faith. I die a Catholic and a Dominican priest. I forgive from my heart all who have conspired to bring about my death.\" Among the crowd at the foot of the scaffold was Dr. William Pilsworth who shouted out: \"This man is innocent! This man is innocent! He saved my life!\" Rev. William Pilsworth was not wanting in courage, but his words fell on deaf ears. With the words \"Deo Gratias\" on his lips Peter O'Higgins was hanged and died upon the gallows.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nIt has been alleged that the main reason for Prior O'Higgins' execution without a formal trial was that a synod at Kells, County Meath chaired by Archbishop Hugh O'Reilly had recently announced, \"That, whereas the Catholics of Ireland have taken up arms in defense of their religion, for the preservation of the King, already threatened with destruction by the Puritans, as likewise for the security of their own lives, possessions, and liberty; we, on the part of the Catholics, declare these proceedings to be most just and lawful. Nevertheless, if, in the pursuit of these objects, any person or persons should be actuated by motives if avarice, malice, or revenge, we declare such persons to be guilty of a grievous offense, and deservedly subject to the censures of the Church, unless upon advice they change their intentions and pursue a different course.\" Fr. O'Higgins believed otherwise and claimed before his death that Sir Charles Coote's signed pardon proved that his imprisonment, trial before a drumhead military tribunal, and death sentence were motivated solely in odium fidei (\"out of hatred of the Faith\").\nFollowing his martyrdom, local Recusants attempted to bury O'Higgins in the Dominican cemetery attached to St Saviour's Priory, located on the north side of the River Liffey where the Four Courts now stands. The burial was interrupted, however, by Royalist soldiers, who desecrated O'Higgins's body, which was then buried outside the city walls of Dublin.\nOn 24 October 1644, the Puritan-controlled Parliament in London, seeking to retaliate for the 1641 uprising, resolved, \"that no quarter shall be given to any Irishman, or to any papist born in Ireland.\" Upon landing with the New Model Army at Dublin, Oliver Cromwell issued orders that no mercy was to be shown to the Irish, whom he said were to be treated like the Canaanites during the time of the Old Testament prophet Joshua.\nAccording to historian D.P. Conyngham, \"It is impossible to estimate the number of Catholics slain the ten years from 1642 to 1652. Three Bishops and more than 300 priests were put to death for their faith. Thousands of men, women, and children were sold as slaves for the West Indies; Sir W. Petty mentions that 6,000 boys and women were thus sold. A letter written in 1656, quoted by Lingard, puts the number at 60,000; as late as 1666 there were 12,000 Irish slaves scattered among the West Indian islands. Forty thousand Irish fled to the Continent, and 20,000 took shelter in the Hebrides or other Scottish islands. In 1641, the population of Ireland was 1,466,000, of whom 1,240,000 were Catholics. In 1659 the population was reduced to 500,091, so that very nearly 1,000,000 must have perished or been driven into exile in the space of eighteen years. In comparison with the population of both periods, this was even worse than the famine extermination of our own days.\"\nOn 27 September 1992, Peter O'Higgins and 16 other Irish Catholic Martyrs were Beatified in Rome by Pope John Paul II.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nPhilip Caraman (1966), The Years of Siege: Catholic Life from James I to Cromwell, Longmans.

He was baptised on 17 September 1769. On 4 June 1779 he was admitted one of the nautical scholars of Christ's Hospital, where he continued for upwards of six years, though for part of the time (14 July 1781–31 Jan. 1784) he was borne on the books of the Grana as servant of the purser, Joseph Withers, presumably his uncle. On 1 December 1785 he was discharged from Christ's Hospital and bound apprentice to Richard Harding, commander of the East India Company's ship Kent, for a term of seven years ‘unless his majesty should require his last year's service’ (information from Christ's Hospital per Mr. W. Lempriere). In May 1793 he entered on board the Agamemnon, then newly commissioned by Captain Horatio Nelson, to whom his North Walsham connection had probably introduced him. In the Agamemnon Withers continued as midshipman, schoolmaster, and master's mate till July 1796, when he followed Nelson to the Captain. During this time he had seen much exceptional service; had been landed at Bastia and Calvi; had been wounded at Oneglia on 29 August 1795, and been captured at Vado in November (Nicolas, Nelson Despatches, ii. 77, 111). On the day after the battle of Cape St. Vincent he was made lieutenant into the prize-ship Salvador del Mundo (15 Feb. 1797, confirmed 22 March). From February 1798 to December 1800 he was serving in the Terrible in the Channel, with Sir Richard Hussey Bickerton, as afterwards in the Kent in the Mediterranean and on the coast of Egypt till August 1802, when he was made acting commander of the expedition. The commission was confirmed on 11 April 1803. For a few months in the end of 1804 he commanded the Tartarus sloop in the Channel, and in 1805 was appointed agent for transports to the Elbe and Weser. In this service he continued: in Sicily, the Ionian Islands, and Alexandria, 1806–7; Halifax and Martinique, 1808–10. During 1810–16 he was principal agent in the Mediterranean—coast of Spain and Italy. He was made post-captain on 13 May 1809. After the war he had no service, and lived in retirement at North Walsham till his death on 4 July 1843.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1900). \"Withers, Thomas\".

        "content": "George Wickens Willes (1785 – 26 October 1846) was a British Royal Navy captain.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWilles was the son of Lieutenant John Willes of the navy (1753–1797), who lost a leg at Gibraltar in 1782, was born in 1785, and in 1794 entered on the books of the Royal William, flagship of Sir Peter Parker (1721–1811) at Spithead. In 1796 he was borne on the books of the Fairy sloop, commanded by his maternal uncle, John Irwin, whom, early in 1797, he followed to the Prince George; in this ship he was present at the battle of Cape St. Vincent. He was afterwards with Irwin in the Lively, Boston, Formidable, and Queen Charlotte. He was in the Success, with Captain Shuldham Peard, at the blockade of Malta, and the capture of the Généreux on 18 February 1800, when he was severely wounded; he was still on the Success when she was taken by Ganteaume on 13 February 1801. On 6 November 1801 he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant; served in the Sophie sloop; in the Active, one of the ships which passed the Dardanelles in February 1807, and in the Spartan, with Captain Jahleel Brenton. During 1809, in command of the frigate's boats, he was repeatedly engaged in storming batteries or destroying coasting vessels in the Adriatic or among the Ionian Islands. He was still in the Spartan when, in Naples Bay on 3 May 1810, she engaged, defeated, and put to flight a Franco-Neapolitan squadron, carrying in the aggregate 95 guns and 1,400 men. ‘I was myself,’ wrote Brenton, ‘wounded about the middle of the action, which lasted two hours; but my place was most ably supplied by Mr. Willes, first lieutenant, whose merit becomes more brilliant by every opportunity he has of showing it. He is, without exception, one of the best and most gallant officers I ever met with.’ Willes, who was himself severely wounded, was promoted on 2 June 1810 to be commander; he was also granted permission to accept and wear the order of St. Ferdinand and Merit, third class.\nIn 1811–12 he commanded the Leveret brig in the North Sea, where he captured several of the enemy's privateers; he was afterwards in the Bacchus on the Irish station, and on 7 June 1814 he was made a captain. In 1817–18 he commanded the Cherub on the coast of Africa; in 1819–1820, the Wye in the North Sea; in 1823–7, the Brazen, on the South American and African stations; and in 1836 the Dublin, as flag-captain to Sir Graham Eden Hamond, on the coast of South America. In February 1845 he commissioned the Vanguard of 80 guns, in which, after a few months in the Channel, he went out to the Mediterranean. He died at Malta on 26 October 1846. Willes married, in 1814, Anne Ellen, daughter of Sir Edmund Lacon, bart., and left issue, among others, the Admiral Sir George Ommanney Willes, G.C.B., who possessed a portrait of his father.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1900). \"Willes, George Wickens\".

        "content": "Landolfo Caracciolo (Latin: Landulphus Caracciolus; died 1351) was a Franciscan theologian, diplomat and prelate from the Kingdom of Naples.\n\n\n== Life ==\nLandolfo Caracciolo, whose name is sometimes anglicized Landulf or Landulph, was born in Naples in the final quarter of the 13th century, probably around 1280 or 1285. His father, Giovanni, had been knighted in 1275, appointed captain of Amalfi in 1300 and named royal treasurer in 1303. Landolfo had three brothers. He obtained a Master of Theology degree, probably from the University of Paris. He joined the Franciscans at an unknown date and served as minister provincial of the Terra di Lavoro from 1320 to 1325.\nIn May–June 1326, Caracciolo was sent by King Robert on a diplomatic mission to Bologna, where he negotiated the provision of 200 knights and 300 lances for beleaguered Florence, then governed by Robert's son, Charles, Duke of Calabria. On 21 August 1327, Caracciolo was appointed bishop of Castellammare di Stabia. On 7 July 1331, the king sought to have the mismanaged monastery on the island of Rovigliano transferred to his administration. Before this could happen, Caracciolo was transferred to the archdiocese of Amalfi  on 20 September 1331. On 29 February 1332, he received the pallium from Pope John XXII, who praised him for helping to suppress the sect of the Fraticelli in the Kingdom of Naples.\nAs archbishop, Caracciolo built a new choir in Amalfi Cathedral. John XXII authorized him to take further action against the Fraticelli. In 1340, he attended the consecration of the church of Santa Chiara. In September–October 1347, he was one of the negotiators at Catania who reached a peace treaty with the Kingdom of Sicily. He subsequently visited Avignon, perhaps in the following of Queen Joan I in 1348.\nOn 17 March 1349, Caracciolo was appointed logothete and protonotary while his relative, Enrico Caracciolo, was named chamberlain. After Enrico was killed on 25 April, Landolfo lost all influence. He died probably in 1351 and was buried in the cathedral. His anniversary was celebrated by the Franciscans on 1 March.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\nLatin manuscript 4376 in the Vatican Library preserves a set of sermons by Caracciolo. It also includes two speeches:\n\nCoram papa, delivered before the pope and the college of cardinals in Avignon, is a defence of Joan I's policy.\nIn morte regis Andree is about the assassinatin of Joan's husband, Andrew of Hungary.\nCaracciolo received the scholastic accolade doctor collectivus. He was a Scotist whose theological writings show the influence of Matthew of Aquasparta and William of Ware. Much of his philosophical writing is devoted to defending John Duns Scotus against the attacks of Peter Auriol. His known works are:\n\nIn Zachariam prophetam, a commentary on the Book of Zechariah\nIn IV Evangelia, a commentary on the Gospel of John\nIn epistolam ad Hebraeos, a commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews\nPostilla super Evangelia dominicalia, dedicated to Monaldo da Perugia\nLiber collationum spiritualium\nQuaestiones in Metaphysicam\na commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard dedicated to King Robert\na Quodlibeta\nHis works are preserved in many manuscripts. Over thirty contain at least one complete book of his commentary on the Sentences. Book 2 of this commentary was printed at Naples by Francesco Del Tuppo in the final decade of the 15th century.\nCaracciolo is most famous in philosophy for his theory of instantaneous change. He held that, in the concept of an instantaneous change, \"a real contradiction is accepted in nature, because the termini of instantaneous change cannot ... belong to different instants of time.\" The law of non-contradiction, hoever, is not violated because \"the instant of time containing a contradictory state of affairs can be divided, although not physically, into instants of nature.\"\nA lost work by Caracciolo on the Immaculate Conception is cited in the Elucidarium virginis of Antonio Bonito de Cucharo (1507).\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBrown, Stephen F.

        "content": "Cornelis Vincentsz van Mierop (1509 – 1572) was archdeacon and cathedral provost, serving as head of the cathedral chapter of St. Martin's Cathedral, Utrecht, the Netherlands. He was also dean of the chapter of St. Salvator's Church in Utrecht.\n\n\n== Life and work ==\nVan Mierop was a son of the Treasurer General of Holland, Vincent Cornelisz and Maria Ruysch. He registered as a minor at the University of Leuven in 1522, which shows that he was not yet fourteen years old at the time (the age at which a boy was allowed to register as an adult there). In 1528, he became dean of the canons of the Hague Court Chapel. He followed in the footsteps of his grandfather, Jacob Ruysch. In 1533, he studied law in Padua, where he received his doctorate in law. Once again, he followed in his grandfather's footsteps. From 1534 to 1537, he was also an unpaid councilor in the Court of Holland. In 1541, he donated the \"Maaghdeglas\" to the Grote Kerk of The Hague. In 1545, Van Mierop was appointed cathedral provost in Utrecht. From 1 June 1547, he was also a councilor in the Privy Council, an advisory body to the ruler at his appointment; this was Emperor Charles V. In 1556, he donated one of the stained glass windows in the Grote or Sint-Janskerk in Gouda, an image of Jesus preaching at the Jordan. He was depicted as the donor of this glass by the glazier Dirk Crabeth. Behind him stands his patron, Saint Vincent. In 1557, Van Mierop provided an interest-free loan of 500 Carolus guilders to the Brothers of the Common Life of the Hieronymushuis on the Kromme Nieuwe Gracht. A gallery was built from his house to the brothers' church and their 'librije,' where the cathedral provost had a prayer room for the rest of his life. In the Centraal Museum in Utrecht, there is a medal from 1558 on which he is depicted. In 1562, he bought the knightly town of Huis te Vliet in Lopik.\nVan Mierop died in 1572. He had arranged in his will that the construction of eleven poor houses would be financed from his estate. These Myropsca lakes were built on the Springweg in Utrecht.\n\n\n== References ==\nBosch, RA, The 72 glasses of the Sint Janskerk in Gouda, Delft, 2008\nBraake, S. ter, With Recht en Account.

        "content": "Forward Observations Group, (nicknamed FOG), is a military lifestyle brand founded by former U.S. Army infantryman Derrick Bales, that sells tactical gear and branded accessories and operates \"popular military lifestyle social media channels\" on Instagram and YouTube. The group has traveled to Ukraine, Iraq, and Syria to make connections with local fighters there and to shoot photo and video from the Russian invasion and Syrian civil war.\n\n\n== Relationship to Ukraine conflict and Russian allegations ==\nAccording to Vice News, in May 2021, pictures of Bales and other FOG members in the Donbas region of Ukraine attracted criticism and media attention for tagging members of the ultranationalist Azov Battalion, and raised questions about whether FOG were documentary journalists or actual combatants.  In one video members of the group were shown in the back of a car driving along a highway approaching the Donetsk Airport, the site of intense fighting between Ukrainian government forces and Kremlin-backed separatists. Other posts showed Bales and other group members holding assault rifles and other weaponry.\nOn March 11, 2022, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement that \"warned of potential chemical provocations in Ukraine\" and accused U.S. \"special services\" and \"radical Ukrainian groups\" of plotting a chemical weapons attack against Ukraine as a false flag to blame Russia. The statement specifically alleged that, in December 2021, “Ukrainian radicals delivered 200-litre metal barrels with foreign markings to Donetsk Oblast. As they were being unloaded, four Ukrainian soldiers received severe chemical burns and poisoning. The general coordination of the delivery and warehousing of hazardous freight was carried out by the staff of the private American military contractor Forward Observation Group (based in the state of Nevada).” The Russian statement provided no evidence for the claims, which were denied by both Bales and the U.S. State Department, which called the allegations \"preposterous,\" and as a “false pretext we have been warning the Kremlin would invent.”\nAccording to Foreign Policy, \"Social media channels linked to the Wagner Group have been marketing T-shirts featuring a soldier swinging a sledgehammer onto a horned skeleton’s head—the logo of the Forward Observations Group\". This is a reference to the murder of Yevgeny Nuzhin, who was tortured and executed by the Wagner Group on accusations of treason.\nFOG also has been active in sourcing medical supplies, gear, and money for Ukrainian fighters and foreign volunteers.\n\n\n== Roll 1 Trauma Pouch ==\n\nFOG is credited with the invention of the oft-copied \"Roll 1 Trauma Pouch\" in 2017, which one of their former 18D's originally designed and fabricated for SOF operators in Syria. It is a type of IFAK intended to be worn in the opening of the rear body armor plate pocket where it is located out of the way while adding lumbar support for full-kit vehicle rides; though with hook and loop Velcro interface it can be worn on the front of a plate carrier, or on a battle belt.  According to FOG, \"the name Roll 1 is a reference to the medical terms relating to levels of care: Role 1 or Echelon 1 is medical support integral at the tactical level that provides immediate life-saving care, first aid and triage. Role 2 is med support at a higher/larger level where Role 1 usually send patients for MEDEVAC. Roles 3 and 4 are specialty surgical capabilities and long-term definitive care.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

In 2023, she released her latest single \"Mil años\", remaining in Peruvian folklore, becoming one of the promising young singers of her genre, in addition to venturing into Peruvian cumbia.\n\n\n== Death ==\nOn 27 March 2024, Quispe went to undergo cosmetic surgery at the Santa Catalina Clinic, owned by the Peruvian physician Víctor Barriga Fong. According to Infobae, Fong is known for having worked for different celebrities in the world according to local media, to have their touch-ups done and had some history of botching them. During the day of her medical appointment, Quispe underwent a successful liposculpture, leaving the hospital after losing blood in her body and resting at home. A few days later, Quispe suffered discomfort and was transferred to the Clínica del Inca, located in the Miraflores District, where she was treated in the intensive care unit.\nQuispe died on the morning of 3 April, in the same place at the age of twenty-three, due to her medical complications, leaving behind an orphaned son, the result of her romantic relationship with Wilfredo Quispe Gaspar. Before her death, Muñequita Milly performed her last concert in Moquegua in March. After the news of her death, she made waves in the media in her country.\nHours after her death, Fong released a statement declaring that Quispe had not undergone her operation at his clinic, noting that none of his surgeons were involved. Quispe's lawyer spoke with Fong about the situation, having had legal advice and was complying with security protocols. Her father Jaime Quispe denounced Fong for the crime of manslaughter due to malpractice after what happened.\nWell-known figures of Peruvian music such as Yarita Lizeth, Sonia Morales, Dina Páucar and Fresialinda, offered condolences for the Quispe family. In addition, Quispe was honored by the Ministry of Culture. Quispe's body was transferred to her hometown, where it was laid to rest in her old home.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n2013: Te esperaré bajo la lluvia\n2014: Vas a llorar\n2015: Tus engaños\n2017: Mi único amor\n2018: Sin piedad me dejaste\n2019: Olvídate de mi\n2020: Pienso en ti\n2020: Comerciante\n2021: Ya no me hagas llorar\n2022: Quién toma más que yo\n2022: Juguete de amor\n2022: La vida es una sola\n2023: Quiero ser tu corazón\n2023: Mil años\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sir John Wetwang (died 1684) was a British Royal Navy captain.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWetwang had possibly been with Prince Rupert or the French privateers during the Commonwealth (cf. Gardiner, First Dutch War, i. 21). The first mention of him is in 1665, when he was appointed captain of the Norwich, a fifth-rate attached to the red squadron in the action off Lowestoft on 3 June. In 1666 he was captain of the Tiger, in 1668 of the Dunkirk, a third-rate. In 1672 he commanded the 70-gun ship Edgar, one of the blue squadron, in the battle of Solebay; in 1673 he was flag-captain to Prince Rupert in the Sovereign. In November he was appointed to the Newcastle, in which, in March 1674, he captured a large Dutch East Indiaman ‘of very great value.’ At the end of the war he took the Newcastle out to the Mediterranean, whence he brought home the ‘trade’ in the spring of 1676. In 1678 he commanded the Royal James as flag-captain to Sir Thomas Allin; in 1679 he was captain of the Northumberland, in 1680 of the Woolwich. On 20 Nov. 1680 he was knighted. In October 1683 he was appointed captain of the East India Company's ship Royal James, with a double commission from the king and the company to command the fleet in the East Indies for reinstating the king of Bantam and re-establishing the trade there. With him was Sir Thomas Grantham, who had a commission to command in his absence. Wetwang died at Fort St. George, Madras, within a few weeks of his arrival in 1684. His will (in Somerset House: Cann, 50)—signed 18 October 1683, proved 8 April 1685—constitutes his ‘dear and well-beloved wife Isabel’ sole executrix, and leaves everything to her during her natural life; after her death, which happened in 1691, to be equally divided among his four sons—Robert, John, Samuel, and Joseph. A brother Joseph, a captain in the navy, is mentioned by Charnock (ii. 58).\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1899). \"Wetwang, John\".

        "content": "The Royal China Company was a Sebring, Ohio dinnerware manufacturer established in 1934 and ceased operations in 1986.\nIn 1934 Beatrice Miller, William H. Habenstreit and John Bert Briggs on South 15th Street in Sebring, Ohio, after buying the former E. H. Sebring China Company (formerly the Oliver China Company building). Six month after the purchase the company has 125 persons on the payroll and produced 7,800,000 pieces in the first year of operation. Beatrice Miller became president in 1946, and the company had 700 employees in 1950.\nMiss Miller became president in 1946, and by 1950, the 125 had increased to 700 employees. Before they closed down, the company produced over 1,700 patterns. They were well known for producing dishes with prints from Currier and Ives, as well as Memory Lane, Colonial Homestead, Old Curiosity Shop, Willow Ware, Fair Oaks, and Bucks County patterns. Their mission was to make affordable china that was sold in grocery stores, five-and-dime stores, catalog mail order houses, and were often used as promotional items by other companies, such as S&H Green Stamps. During the early 1905s a 20 piece set could be purchased for $6. In 1966 you could purchase an 53 piece \"Ironstone\" service of eight for $18.88.\nIn 1962 the company bought out the defunct W. S. George Pottery Company, and purchased the French-Saxon China Company in 1964, making them the largest unionized china manufacturer in the United States with $6 million in sales. Beatrice Miller retired in 1969, at which point the plant was sold to the Jeannette Glass Company. The plant was rebuilt after a fire on February 15, 1970, after which they continued to produce dinnerware, with 81 different patterns and over 30,000,000 pieces with sales around $16 million. This made them the third largest china manufacturer in the United States at the time. Later the company was sold to Coca-Cola Bottling, then an investment group, The J Corporation, and once again by the Nordic Capital Corporation in April 1984. Production ceased in 1986 when Bank One auctioned off the plant's contents. What was left of the plant caught fire in 2010 and the remaining buildings were demolished. Cleanup of the site, which contained contaminated soil, began after being purched by Michael Conny in 2020.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Macallum Street Ghaut is a residential neighbourhood within the city of George Town in the Malaysian state of Penang. Situated within the city's central business district, it comprises seven blocks of low-cost public housing built on reclaimed land off Macallum Street, known as the Macallum Street Ghaut flats. The first apartment blocks were completed in 1985, and they remain among the few formalised low-cost housing areas in the vicinity of the city's UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the years following Malaya's independence, the Penang state government expressed interest in developing low-cost public housing. This brought the state government into conflict with the George Town City Council over the provision of affordable housing within the limits of George Town. In 1969, the Penang Development Corporation (PDC) was formed under the direction of newly elected Chief Minister Lim Chong Eu, partly to address the issue of urban overcrowding within the city.\nAs part of the solution, Macallum Street Ghaut (ghat) was designated one of the four Comprehensive Development Areas (CDA) in the city proper. The PDC planned to reclaim 20.2 hectares (50 acres) off Macallum Street to build inexpensive European-style apartment blocks to house residents displaced by the concurrent Komtar project nearby. The Macallum Street Ghaut flats were the first public housing project undertaken by the PDC, to be followed by similar projects at Kedah Road and Bayan Baru.\nBy 1985, three 22-storey blocks and two 12-storey blocks containing a total of 1,469 residential units were completed. In total, seven apartment blocks were constructed and remain a major inhabited residential pocket at the periphery of George Town's UNESCO World Heritage Site, in spite of the continuing depopulation of the city centre.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRifle Range, Penang\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "For King and Empire is a 1906 Australian play by Edward Irham Cole although several scenes and incidents were suggested by Edward William O'Sullivan.\nThe play was performed by Cole's Bohemian Dramatic Company.\nIt was a \"military drama\" set in the future \"which deals with a European war, In which England and America, with the assistance of Australia are engaged against Russia and Germany.\"\nThe Evening News said \"The piece is well staged, and well played, and had a very good reception.\" It appears the play drew strong crowds.\nThe play is not to be confused with For King and Empire a Boer War drama performed by Bohemian Dramatic Company.\nThe play was successfully revived in 1914.\n\n\n== Premise ==\n\"The play opens at the home of Captain Raymond, a retired seafarer, whose home is brightened by the presence of his adopted daughter, Sylvia Tressilion. War breaks out, and Australia responds to the call; in fact some of her fighters have already returned from the fight. Among the returned heroes is Captain Gerald Berkley, who is in love with Sylvia, but Berkely has a rival in the form of Lieutenant Sydney Bolton, also an enemy in Sidney's cousin, Graham. Sydney Bolton endeavors to secure Sylvia's hand and fortune in order to redeem his own financial position. He forces a quarrel on Berkely, but gets the worst of it. Sylvia is decoyed to Bolton's home, and while there witnesses a murder of which her lover is later accused. Her evidence saves him, but Graham Bolton, knowing that Gerald is again ordered to the front, seeks to prove the charge. Complications, tragedy, and sensation follow, but the supposed murder is finally cleared up, and the play concludes with the prospect of peace and happiness.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Thomas Watson (died 4 June 1744) was a British Royal Navy captain.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWatson may very possibly, as Charnock supposes, have served as a midshipman with Edward Vernon, perhaps in the Grafton. The only mention of him now to be found is as first lieutenant of the Antelope in 1733, till his promotion on 7 October 1737 to be captain of the Antelope. On 10 July 1739 he was appointed to the Burford as Vernon's flag-captain, and acted in that capacity at the reduction of Porto Bello. In January 1740–1 he moved with Vernon to the Princess Caroline, was flag-captain during the abortive attack on Cartagena, and in June 1741 moved again with Vernon to the Boyne, in which he returned to England in December 1742. In September 1743 he was appointed to the 70-gun ship Northumberland, which in the following spring was one of the fleet sent out to Lisbon under the command of Sir Charles Hardy the elder. On the homeward voyage at daybreak on 8 May the Northumberland, looking out ahead, was ordered by signal to chase a strange sail seen to the northward. She did not come up with it, and did not obey her recall, which was made about two o'clock. The weather got thick and squally; she lost sight of the fleet; then of the chase; but about four o'clock sighted three ships to the leeward, that is in the east quarter, the wind being westerly. Towards these strangers the Northumberland ran down. They lay-to wait for her; it was seen that they were French and that two of them were ships of 64 guns; the third was a 26-gun frigate. One of the 64-gun ships, the Content, was about a mile to windward of her consort, the Mars; and if Watson had engaged her, he might possibly have disabled her before the Mars could come to her support. It was clearly the only sane thing to do, if he refused to accept the advice offered by the master and endeavour to lead the Frenchmen back to Hardy's fleet.\nBut Watson was in no humour to follow advice or plan which savoured of caution. While with Vernon he must have been a capable officer; but since then, it is said, his skull had been fractured in a fall, ‘and a small matter of liquor rendered him quite out of order—which was his unhappy fate that day’ (A True and Authentick Narrative of the Action between the Northumberland and three French Men of War ... By an Eye-Witness). ‘We bore down on them,’ says the eye-witness, ‘so precipitately that our small sails were not stowed nor top-gallant sails furled before the enemy began to fire on us, and at the same time had the cabins to clear away; the hammocks were not stowed as they should be; in short, we had nothing in order as we should before action.’ About five o'clock the Northumberland closed with the Content and received her fire, but, without replying to it, ran down to the Mars. The Content followed, so did the frigate. The Northumberland was a target for the three of them. The men at the wheel were killed, and nobody thought of sending others to take their place. The captain was mad-drunk, the master a shivering coward, and the lieutenants unable or unwilling to take the command. The captain was mortally wounded; and before the first lieutenant could get on deck, the master struck the colours, and the ship was taken possession of. Watson died in France on 4 June 1744. The master, tried by court-martial on 1 February 1745, was sentenced to be imprisoned in the Marshalsea for life; he was spared the capital punishment on the ground that he had given good advice to his captain before the action.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1899). \"Watson, Thomas (d.1744)\".

It is the eleventh in a series of novels featuring the Golden Age Detective Chief Constable Sir Clinton Driffield and was published by Hodder and Stoughton in London and Little, Brown and Company in the United States. In a New York Times review Isaac Anderson noted Sir Clinton as being rare amongst Chief Constables in British mystery stories for his competence noting \"If you have not previously met him in Mr. Connington’s other novels, this is a good time to make his acquaintance, for in this book you will see him at his best\".\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe police are called to the house of Mrs. Deerhurst after she has vanished and a pool of blood of is found on the floor. Shortly afterwards the body of her estranged husband, a fraudster responsible for the financial ruination of her late father's firm, is found shortly after he was released from prison. The dead man had numerous enemies who might have gone so far to kill him, but the most obvious candidates are his wife and her cousin who also served prison time for the fraud. Yet the strange disappearance of Mrs. Deerhurst seems to hold the real clue of the case. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nEvans, Curtis.

        "revision_id": 1218064373,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Tennessee v. Federal Communications Commission, 832 F.3d 597 (2016), was a ruling of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, holding that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) does not have the authority to preempt states from enforcing \"anti-expansion\" statutes that prohibit local municipal broadband networks from being expanded into nearby communities.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn the early 2010s, Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Wilson, North Carolina, developed taxpayer-funded and non-profit municipal broadband networks that operated in tandem with each city's electrical service. Both networks demonstrated economic benefits for the cities, and in both cases nearby communities requested that the municipal networks be extended beyond city limits.\nChattanooga was prevented from extending its network beyond its city limits by a Tennessee state law that prohibited municipal electricity service providers from providing Internet service outside of their service territories. Wilson was prevented from expanding its network by a North Carolina law that imposed onerous financial requirements on that type of geographic expansion. Such statutes are often called \"anti-expansion\" or \"anti-municipal\" laws, and they are typically descended from regulations that protected exclusive cable TV franchises within a given city.\n\n\n== FCC adjudication ==\nChattanooga and Wilson both petitioned the FCC to override the respective state laws in the interests of providing broadband service to underserved communities that had been neglected by major telecommunications firms. In a 2015 adjudicative hearing, the FCC ruled that the state laws acted as barriers to entry that prevented municipal networks from competing with commercial telecommunications providers (if any were present in the territory). The Commission cited Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which enabled it to promote advanced telecommunications services and to remove barriers to competition and investment in that market; the commission also claimed that it could regulate that market per the commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution.\nThus, the FCC concluded that it had the authority to preempt the anti-expansion laws in Tennessee and North Carolina, which would allow the planned expansion of Chattanooga's and Wilson's municipal broadband networks into nearby communities. The two states appealed this ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which heard the case in 2016.\n\n\n== Circuit Court opinion ==\nThe Sixth Circuit reversed the FCC's adjudicative ruling, and found that Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 did not provide the authority to preempt state laws on matters that were not covered in corresponding federal laws. The Circuit Court held that there were no federal laws, including the 1996 Act, that dictated the geographic areas that municipal broadband providers must or must not serve. Such decisions could be made by local governments, unless their states claimed police power to make decisions on behalf of their cities or counties, as had both Tennessee and North Carolina.\nThe circuit court also cited a Supreme court precedent, Nixon v. Missouri Municipal League, in which the high court ruled that the FCC did not have the authority to preempt a state law on a different matter because that matter had not been addressed specifically in the 1996 Act. Per that precedent, the FCC must have received specific instructions from the U.S. Congress on the matter at hand in order to preempt any state law. Since the 1996 Act contained no precise instructions on adjudicating the geographic limits of municipal broadband service providers, the FCC did not have the authority to preempt the anti-expansion laws in Tennessee and North Carolina.\n\n\n== Impact ==\nAs a result of the Sixth Circuit ruling, Chattanooga and Wilson were prohibited from expanding their municipal broadband networks to nearby communities that had requested connections, though those communities were not prevented from developing their own municipal networks if they wished. However, deciding whether such projects were in the public interest was left to states. Furthermore, governmental processes in several states including Tennessee and North Carolina, and those states' authority over decisions made by cities, conflicted with the FCC's attempts to support municipal broadband networks in underserved areas.\nThe ruling established a procedural precedent in which it is now assumed that the FCC cannot preempt state laws on any matter unless that matter is expressly covered in the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The conflict between this interpretation, and the FCC's statutory mandate to facilitate the development of advanced telecommunications networks, has generated scholarly dispute. Researchers have argued that state anti-expansion laws are an advantage for commercial telecommunications firms who have lobbied for protection from non-profit competition, even in localities that they have refused to serve.\nIt had been argued that the ruling in Tennessee v. FCC has held back the deployment of broadband Internet service in rural areas, and some urban areas, that have been neglected by commercial providers, which in turn has had a negative impact on commerce and education in such communities. Since the ruling, more states have instituted anti-expansion laws at the behest of commercial telecommunications firms, preventing a city's municipal network from expanding to nearby areas that need broadband service, and some states have prohibited the development of taxpayer-funded networks altogether even if commercial firms have shown no interest in those communities.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Beskidenverein, Beskiden-Verein, Beskiden Verein was a German tourist association founded in 1893. It was the first organization operating in the Beskids region, which at that time belonged to Austria-Hungary and currently belongs to Poland; the Polish Tatra Association was founded in 1873 but initially limited its activities to the Tatra Mountains and the Beskid ranges located in present-day Ukraine, while the Czech Pohorská jednota \"Radhošť\" was active in the Beskids currently belonging to the Czech Republic.\nBeskidenverein conducted extensive activities to promote mass tourism and was a pioneer of Beskid tourism in many fields. It operated officially until 1945.\n\n\n== Beginnings and activities until 1918 ==\n\nThe second half of the 19th century marked the creation of the first tourist and mountain organizations across Europe. In Austrian Silesia, the first branches of the German Moravian-Silesian Sudeten Mountain Association (German: Mährisch-Schlesischer Sudetengebirgsverein, MSSGV) were established – a section in Opava (1882), followed by one in Vitkovice (now a district of Ostrava – 1884). In 1884, the Czech Pohorská jednota \"Radhošť\" was founded in Frenštát pod Radhoštěm. Already then, there were voices calling for the creation of a German tourist organization operating solely in the Beskids – active proponents of this were Karl Richter, a politician and lawyer, and teacher Johann Hadaszczok, both from Moravian Ostrava. Their dreams came true on 28 February 1893 – Beskidenverein was founded in Frýdek-Místek. It was modeled after the Austrian (and later all-German) organization Austrian Alpine Club. The headquarters were initially planned for Frýdek-Místek but were eventually established in Moravian Ostrava and later moved to Cieszyn. Karl Richter became the first chairman. At the turn of the century, the most active members were high school professors from Moravian Ostrava (Josef Matzura), Cieszyn (Alois Steiner), and Bielsko (Karl Kolbenheyer).\nBeskidenverein was organized into independent sections, covering the entire area of interest. Its members were Germans living in large numbers in the Austrian Silesia of the time and in northern Moravia. The goal was to develop the areas from Lysá hora in the west to Babia Góra in the east of the Beskids for tourist purposes: to facilitate the practical realization of goals (...) through trail marking and road improvement, through the construction and operation of mountain support points – facilitating movement in the Beskids and increasing the desire for hiking (quote from Beskidenverein's statute from 1893).\nThe main sources of funding (besides membership fees) included financial support from German landowners, the German bourgeoisie, and industrialists. The association was also materially and politically supported by the Cieszyn princes from the Habsburg line – Archduke Albrecht, and after his death in 1895, Archduke Friedrich.\nAmong the tourists visiting the Silesian Beskids at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, numbering tens of thousands annually, about 90% were Germans, with the remaining mainly being Czechs. The number of Poles hiking the mountain trails was estimated to be only 1%. Beskidenverein was an organization of Germans, and most of its activities were conducted through the prism of the interests of this national group. For this reason, conflicts arose with similar Czech and Polish organizations, which intensified during the interwar period, under changed political and economic conditions.\n\n\n=== Organizational division before World War I ===\nIn 1909, the association already had 13 sections – the strongest in Bielsko (and Biała – Sektion Bielitz-Biala, also Beskiden Bielitz-Biala Verein), Cieszyn, and Vítkovice. The territorial division looked as follows: Austrian Silesia – Bielsko, Cieszyn, Frýdek-Místek, Bílovec (since 1901), Bohumín (since 1909); Moravia – Moravian Ostrava, Místek, Vítkovice, Frýdlant nad Ostravicí, Nový Jičín; German Upper Silesia: Racibórz (since 1897), Katowice (since 1898), Bytom (since 1906), and Mysłowice (since 1907). World War I did not slow down the development of Beskidenverein – in 1915, the number of sections increased to 18; additional sections came from Germany – Pszczyna, Rybnik, Chorzów, and even a distant section from Wrocław.\nThe most active was the Bielsko section – already in the year of its establishment, it had 432 members (in 1909 – 1210) and marked trails to Szyndzielnia, Klimczok, and Błatnia. At the turn of the century, it was led by Paul Niepen and Robert Meinhardt.\nThe general meetings of Beskidenverein were held each time in the headquarters of a different section, which participated in the deliberations through their delegates.\n\n\n=== Number of Beskidenverein members from 1893 to 1909 ===\n1893 – 1534\n1895 – 1814\n1900 – 2835\n1905 – 3238\n1909 – 4618\nIn 1915, the number of association members exceeded 5,000. The majority of them (about 40%) came from the German Empire, slightly fewer from Austrian Silesia, and about 25% from Moravia.\n\n\n=== Trail blazing activities in the Beskids ===\nThe association marked and established hiking trails. In the year of Beskidenverein's establishment, it marked the first trails in the Beskids – around Klimczok, Magura, and Błatnia. However, it is not known in what form and which routes were marked; the first detailed description of trails concerns the areas around Babia Góra. In August 1894, Wilhelm Schlesinger (a member of the Bielsko Beskidenverein), Lajos Klein (a postmaster from Oravská Polhora), and two other activists marked the Slaná Voda trail (from the Słona woda spa in Oravská Polhora) – Polana Hucisko–Gajówka Hviezdoslava–Głodna Woda–Diablak. The color of the trail was red. On 11 June 1895, after obtaining permission from the Directorate of Żywiec Estates (the area belonged to Archduke Charles Stephen of Austria), Schlesinger, along with a team, marked the first precisely described trail in the Polish Beskids on the route Zawoja–Gruba Jodła–Markowe Szczawiny–Dejakowe Szczawiny–Stary Groń–Widły. The first Polish trail appeared in this area (and also in the entire Western Beskids) only in 1906. The signposts displayed only in the German language; they directed, among others, to Brana (Cyl), Branasattel (Brona pass), and Teufelspitze (Diablak).\nBy 1908, Beskidenverein had already established 300 km of trails, and the marking system – a colored strip between two white ones (established in 1897 and formally approved in 1899) – was later adopted in many countries, and it was also used by the Polish Tatra Association.\n\n\n=== Publishing activities ===\nBeskidenverein was a pioneer in many fields in the Beskids, and its publishing activity was extremely important. It published numerous maps, the first mountain guides, jubilee books, reports, and periodicals (including Mitteilungen des Beskidenvereines, from 1904 to 1915, first in Bielsko, then in Cieszyn; the bulletin was published 6 times a year, initially with a circulation of 4,000 copies, later increased to 5,200 copies).\nThe strongest Bielsko section began publishing its own yearbooks (Jahresbericht der Sektion Bielitz-Biala des Beskiden-Vereines) in the year of the organization's and section's founding – 1893. Initially, they were modest, several-page brochures in a reporting form. From 1900 onwards, the name was changed to Jahresbericht der Sektion Bielitz-Biala des Beskiden-Vereines and the volume was increased. Feuilletons and more ambitious texts began to appear. The yearbook was published until 1911, then there was a long break until the interwar period. In 1927, a report was issued for the years 1912–1925, as well as in 1928 for the years 1926–1927. Subsequent issues were irregularly published in the form of a short brochure. The last one was published in 1943 as a report for the previous year. At that time, the section also prepared a jubilee publication on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of its activity – as it turned out, this was the last aspect of Beskidenverein's publishing activity.\nThe Bielsko section also had a significant role in preparing tourist maps and guides. The most important publications include:\n\nFührer durch die Beskiden im Gebiete der Section Bielitz-Biala des Beskiden-Vereines – 1891, by Karl Kolbenheyer,\nIllustrirter Führer durch die Beskiden und die agrenzenden Landschaften – 1891, by Josef Matzura,\nFührer durch Bielitz-Biala und Umgebung – 1912,\nSpezialkarte des schles.-gal. Beskiden – by Wilhelm Schlesinger.\nAmong other sections, the Frýdek-Místek section was also active in publishing. The most important publication was the guide Führer durch die Beskiden by Johann Hadaszczok, reissued several times.\nThe Bielsko section established a library where it collected a collection of books related to the mountains. In 1903, it contained 55 volumes.\n\n\n=== Beskidenverein's mountain huts ===\n\nBeskidenverein promoted both mountain tourism and skiing, but above all, it built the first true mountain huts in the Beskids (lodging facilities already existed in the mountains before, but they were not typical tourist shelters – they were used by aristocrats and hunting clubs, not tourists). Before World War I, they were opened in the following locations:\n\nJaworowy (Jaworowy, Gross Jaworowy) – April 1895; it was built by the Cieszyn section. It was the first true mountain hut in the Beskids (Erzherzog–Friedrich–Schutzhaus in honor of Archduke Friedrich of the Cieszyn line of the Habsburgs), very popular among tourists (already eight days after opening, the thousandth guest arrived, and on average, 6,000 people visited the facility within a year);\nLysá hora (Lysa–Berg, Kahlberg) – 1895, created by the joint efforts of five sections under the name Erzherzog–Albrecht–Schutzhaus. The patron was Archduke Albrecht, who died that year. In 1908, on the trail leading to the summit, the Ostrauer Hütte was opened as a resting place for less experienced tourists. The facility on the summit was managed by the Main Board of Beskidenverein, while Ostrauer Hütte was managed by the Moravian Ostrava section;\nSzyndzielnia (Kamitzerplatte) – 1897. It was the first mountain hut (Schutzhaus auf dem Kamitzerplatte) in the Beskids that currently belong to Poland, still existing after expansion. In 1907, on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the shelter's establishment, a wooden cottage in Swiss style was added, intended as an additional shelter. The land under the shelter became the property of the association only in 1940, after a long lease period. It was managed by the Bielsko section. In 1906, next to the hut, a botanical garden (alpine garden) called the Beskidy Garden was established – it covered about 400 m2 and had 350 plants of 120 species. The idea was proposed by Dr. Edward Schnack, a Beskidenverein member, museum curator, and naturalist. The garden exists to this day;\nBílý Kříž (Weisses Kreuz) in the range of Malý Polom – in 1897, the inn and hut Beskidenheim were leased from a Czech owner; in its place, in 1902, the Vitkovice section opened a new, larger hut Schutzhütte Weisse Kreuz. In 1907, a summer villa called Josefinenheim was made available to tourists, named after the wife of a great friend and donor of Beskidenverein, Friedrich Schuster;\nSlavíč – 1898 or 1899; a small mountain hut (Hadaszczok–Hütte) dedicated to the memory of Johann Hadaszczok, the second president of Beskidenverein, who died in 1895 shortly after a mountain hike (he had serious health problems). Managed by the Vitkovice section;\nMagurka Wilkowicka (Josefsberg) – 1903, burned twice, in 1907 and 1912, rebuilt twice under the name Erzherzogin Maria Theresia – Schutzhaus auf dem Josefsberg. It exists to this day;\nCzantoria Wielka (Großer Czantory-Berg) – 1904 as Erzherzogin Isabella – Schutzhaus auf dem Großer Czantory-Berg (the patron was Isabella von Croy-Dülmen, wife of Archduke Friedrich, the then Duke of Cieszyn). Built and managed by the Cieszyn section. It exists to this day;\nBabia Góra (Teufelspitze) – built in 1905 as Schlesinger-Schutzhaus (named after Wilhelm Schlesinger, who contributed greatly to the Beskid Association). Until the 1930s, it was the highest located mountain hut in the Carpathians. It was located in Hungary, and after the border regulation in Orava in 1920, it became part of Poland. In 1933, the State Forest Directorate from Lviv contested Beskidenverein's right to the land on which the hut stood, and after a court case, it was taken over by Germans in 1938 (actually, in 1936, it was transferred to the State Forest Cooperative \"Leśnik\" from Lviv). Until 1939, it functioned as a Polish shelter, popularly called Leśnik. Currently, it no longer exists – deprived of a caretaker in 1948, it was destroyed by a fire, and the ruins were demolished to the foundations in 1980. Since 1905, there was also a guestbook with an appeal in three languages – German, Hungarian, and Polish. Earlier, in 1904, Beskidenverein installed a box with a memorial book for tourists at the top of Babia Góra, according to which an average of about 400 people visited the summit at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries.\nAt Klimczok, in the years 1894–1895, at the initiative of the association, the existing wooden hut from 1872, which mainly served hunters (called Klementinenhütte after the name of the owner of these lands – Klementyna von Primavesi), was expanded. Unfortunately, the building was destroyed by fire three times (in 1895 during the opening after the expansion, in 1910, and in 1913). Consequently, with the support of Beskidenverein, a new stone hut was built in 1914, which has survived to the present day.\nAll mentioned huts had restaurants, and accommodation was possible in separate rooms for \"ladies\" and \"gentlemen\". At the beginning of the 20th century, accommodation cost 1.60 krones, while a mattress cost 60 halerzys. With the exception of Hadaszczok–Hütte, the facilities were open all year round.\nIn 1894, on the slopes of Dębowiec (Seniorberg), in the former hunting lodge of the Sułkowski princes, the association opened a tavern (Baumgärtel). However, this was not a typical mountain hut, and in the early years, it mainly served as a resting place for tourists heading from Bielsko to Szyndzielnia. Only later did it begin to offer accommodation. It still exists and serves tourists as a gastronomic facility.\nA wooden shelter was also built on Romanka (known as Ski-hütte), intended for skiers, but it was destroyed during World War I by highlanders.\nAlready in this period, conflicts arose between the association and Polish and Czech organizations. Germans mainly used the German language on their signs, markings, and in huts (it was mandatory for Beskidenverein members); however, there were also Hungarian inscriptions on Babia Góra, and sporadically Polish and Czech ones. Poles and Czechs demanded bilingual names, to which Germans did not agree, arguing that German-speaking tourists constituted a significant majority on the trails.\n\n\n=== Organization of leisure activities for children ===\nSimilarly to other German tourist organizations, Beskidenverein also decided to organize summer camps for children as a way to promote active tourism from a young age. The section from Moravian Ostrava started sending children to Jablunkov in 1901, and from 1903 to Poruba. In 1908, they transferred the organization of the summer camps to an independent association called Fereinheim.\nIn addition to organizing summer camps, Beskidenverein initiated charitable actions towards local poor German or highlander children at the end of the 19th century. Clothing, footwear, and sweets were distributed during these initiatives.\n\n\n=== Popularization of skiing ===\nIn 1907, the Bielsko section established the Winter Sports Club (Wintersportclub Bielitz-Biala des Beskidensvereines), which promoted winter sports, mainly skiing, among Silesian and Lesser Poland Germans. After World War I, it participated in the founding of the Polish Ski Association. The best skier from the Winter Sports Club, Teodor Winschenk (Weinschenck), became a three-time Polish champion during the interwar period and represented Poland in alpine skiing events at the 1936 Winter Olympics. This section quickly separated from the parent organization, and its history followed a separate path.\nIn January 1906, before the establishment of the Winter Sports Club, six skiers from Zabrze, belonging to Beskidenverein, were the first to reach the summit of Diablak. They started their route in Jeleśnia, braving difficult weather conditions, then headed to Jałowiecka pass, and after conquering the \"Queen of the Beskids\", they spent the night in the hut under Babia Góra (which was normally closed in winter at that time).\nThe first skiing competitions under the patronage of Beskidenverein took place in 1907 on the slopes of Lysá hora, with 32 participants. It was for the needs of skiers, among others, that Ostrauer Hütte was built, as well as ski shelters on Romanka (in 1912) and Skrzyczne (in 1924).\nFrequent competitions and training courses were also organized on the sub-peak clearings of Magurka Wilkowicka.\n\n\n=== Cooperation with other tourist associations ===\n\nThe authorities of Beskidenverein were aware that cooperation between mountain associations would be crucial for promoting tourism. Within the German Empire and Austria-Hungary, there were many similar organizations, mainly German, focusing their activities on various mountain ranges.\nIn 1895, an exhibition was organized in Cieszyn, which illustrated the past activities of Beskidenverein and emphasized the beauty of the Beskids. Associations from other mountain ranges were also invited to participate.\nIn 1899, the Bielsko section of Beskidenverein proposed an exchange of discounts to the Moravian-Silesian Sudeten Mountain Association. Its members were to receive discounts at the shelter on Szyndzielnia, administered by the Bielsko section, in exchange for discounts at Sudeten shelters. The Main Board of Moravian-Silesian Sudeten Mountain Association initially accepted the proposal favorably but ultimately rejected it, resolving that the exchange of discounts could only occur between associations, not with a single section.\nIt wasn't until 1902 that Beskidenverein entered into a multilateral agreement for cooperation and discount exchange. Besides Moravian-Silesian Sudeten Mountain Association, numerous sections from the German and Austrian Alpine Club (Deutscher und Oesterreichischer Alpenverein, DuÖAV), the German Tourist Association from Brno (Verein deutscher Touristen in Brünn), and several other smaller organizations signed the agreement (totaling over 50 sections and over 100 shelters). The agreement was terminated in 1906 due to financial reasons; it was not advantageous for the alpine associations whose members rarely visited the Beskids or the Sudetes. In 1913, Beskidenverein members regained discounts at Moravian-Silesian Sudeten Mountain Association huts, and from 1914, Beskidenverein huts applied the same discounts to members of the Moravian-Silesian association.\n\n\n== Division of the Beskidenverein after World War I ==\nThe activities of the Beskidenverein continued after World War I. Silesia, which had previously belonged to the Habsburg monarchy, was divided between Poland and Czechoslovakia, while the former Prussian Silesia was divided between Poland and the Weimar Republic. The fate of individual sections of the Beskidenverein, which found themselves on different sides of the border, began to diverge, depending on the country they were in. In practice, two separate organizations (Polish and Czechoslovak) emerged, which, however, cooperated with each other.\n\n\n== Activities of the Beskidenverein in independent Poland ==\nThe Polish Beskidenverein actively competed with Polish tourist organizations, as evidenced by the \"paintbrush war\" on the slopes of Babia Góra, which dates back to the first decade of the 20th century. Initially, the contacts between these two organizations were not bad, and the Tatra Association (as the Polish Tatra Association was called before 1920) was even a member of the Beskidenverein, and both organizations granted each other discounts. However, in 1904/1905, the conflict escalated when the Tatra Association decided to establish a branch covering the Beskids and to build a mountain hut at Markowe Szczawiny. At that time, the Poles decided to stop granting discounts to Beskidenverein members, although formally they did not withdraw from its structures. Conflicts continued after 1918, practically until the end of the interwar period. Short periods of cooperation were interspersed with a struggle for tourists, often conducted illegally, such as sabotaging opponents' trails. The main reason for this rivalry was the national issue – Beskidenverein promoted German identity and mainly served German tourists, while the Tatra Association sought to limit German influence.\nThe Polish state made attempts to force the Beskidenverein to merge with the Tatra Association in order to limit its influence in the Beskids (which was not done in relation to other tourist organizations). German facilities were meticulously controlled, Tatra cards for crossing the mountain border with Czechoslovakia were not issued, and sabotage occurred (not only trail repainting, which both sides engaged in, but also arson). German activists complained that in the reports of Polish commissioners, better-equipped Beskidenverein mountain huts fared worse than Polish ones. Another activity was the placement of Polish facilities near existing German buildings – this avoided cumbersome building procedures, and German huts had fewer tourists. Beskidenverein, due to its economic activity, had to pay taxes, while Polish tourist organizations were exempt as public utility entities. This raised frequent suspicions and grievances among Polish Germans that the Polish state did not treat them the same as their Polish counterparts.\nSimilarly to before the war, the strongest section in independent Poland was the Bielsko section, which took on an informal leading role in Beskidenverein (in meetings with other tourist organizations, Polish Beskidenverein often appeared as Beskidenverein Bielsko) – it was the most active and had the largest number of members (the largest number of Germans in Polish Silesia and western Lesser Poland lived in Bielsko and Biała). Bielsko also became the main headquarters of the Polish part of Beskidenverein, which, according to Polish law, could not be part of a foreign association, so it separated from the sections that ended up in Czechoslovakia.\nIn 1927, the Society had about 4,000 members, in 1933 5,000 members, but later their number gradually decreased – in 1936 it was supposed to be about 1,600, but this value seems understated.\nThe strongest section from Bielsko had 2,300 members in 1927 (compared to 1,035 in 1911), and in 1931 – 2,600.\nIn the second half of the 1930s, some Beskidenverein activists' alignment with the Jungdeutsche Partei – which supported Hitler and pursued an anti-Polish policy – cast a shadow over the association. Some Beskidenverein members were also members of the \"Young German Party\" and used association facilities for supervision and espionage purposes.\n\n\n=== Attempts at agreement and conflicts with the Polish Tatra Association ===\nIn the early 1920s, the Tatra Association proposed to Beskidenverein to join the Polish organization as a separate branch (this was also demanded by Polish authorities) – Beskidenverein did not respond to this proposal, fearing absorption by the Poles and seeing it as an attack on its own sovereignty and the longstanding tradition of pioneering tourism in the Beskids. In areas where trail blazing activities were conducted, attempts were made to obtain exclusivity.\nIn 1927, the Union of Beskidy Associations in Poland (Verband Beskidenvereine in Polen) was established with its main headquarters in Bielsko. It was formed by non-Polish tourist organizations to have greater impact in competition with Polish organizations. In addition to Beskidenverein, the Society of Friends of Nature (Naturfreunde) from Bielsko and Aleksandrowice (Alexanderfeld), the Winter Sports Club from Bielsko (which soon after its establishment separated from the \"mountain\" Beskidenverein), the Jewish Sports Society \"Makkabi\" from Bielsko, and the German Alpine Club, which had its section in Katowice since 1913 and counted 307 members in 1930, were included. At that time, Beskidenverein also competed with Polish organizations in terms of membership fees – at the end of the 1920s, the fee was 5 złoty plus 1 złoty entrance fee, which entitled members to a 50% discount at mountain huts belonging to the Beskidy Associations in Poland and Czechoslovakia (and at facilities of affiliated organizations) – at the same time, the Tatra Association charged 18 złoty and 5 złoty, respectively.\nIn early 1928, a dispute erupted over the expansion of the mountain hut on Babia Góra – Poles protested, fearing that a larger German hut would marginalize the facility at Markowe Szczawiny and simultaneously pointing out that the expansion would take place in a nature-protected area. The Nowy Targ County sided with the Tatra Association and prohibited work on the German hut. In response to this situation, Beskidenverein decided to build a new facility in another part of the Beskids – in Hala Lipowska.\nIn October 1928, a joint conference was held at the Tatra Association premises in Katowice to end the conflict. Beskidenverein appeared as the Beskidy Associations in Poland, representing existing branches from Bielsko and Biała, Cieszyn, Pszczyna, Nowy Bytom, Królewska Huta, and other allied organizations. The Poles agreed to let Beskidenverein conduct trail blazing according to its system in the areas around Magura, Klimczok, Błatnia, and Skrzyczne (where it was most active), while the trail from Przyborów to Babia Góra would remain under German supervision, but with Tatra Association trail blazing. The Polish organization did not rule out enlarging the \"zone of influence\" of Beskidenverein but demanded restrictions on activities in the area from Cieszyn to Babia Góra (thus in the southern regions of Polish Silesian and Żywiec Beskids), where Tatra Association already dominated.\nIn 1929, another meeting of delegates from both organizations took place, this time in Cieszyn. Once again, the territorial scope of Beskidenverein's activities was established (it did not differ significantly from that in Katowice) – Little Beskids on the left bank of the Soła river, the Klimczok group (including Błatnia) up to the Beskidek pass between Brenna and Szczyrk, the route to Skrzyczne, and the trails to the mountain hut on Babia Góra and to the Salmopolska pass. At the same time, Beskidenverein activists definitively refused to join the Polish Tatra Association and recognize its authority.\nIn 1931, Beskidenverein joined the Union of Polish Tourist Associations in Warsaw (established in 1927), but this did not lead to any specific solutions; too many different organizations were part of it, often representing conflicting interests, and numerous conflicts led to its dissolution in 1937.\nThe agreement reached in Katowice and Cieszyn lasted only until 1931 when the Polish Tatra Association obtained exclusivity from the Ministry of Public Works for conducting tourist activities in the mountains – all other organizations were required to coordinate their activities with Polish Tatra Association. Naturally, Beskidenverein activists did not accept this state of affairs. Unable to expand the mountain hut on Babia Góra, they appealed to the ministry for funding to build a new facility on Hala Lipowska. However, it turned out that the necessary funds had already been allocated to Polish Tatra Association, with whom the matter of construction and any potential subsidies needed to be discussed. The Poles positively assessed the needs of Beskidenverein but allocated funds for the repair of hiking trails and current maintenance in existing huts. They did not approve the construction of a new German facility, arguing that it was outside the \"zone of influence\" agreed upon in Katowice in 1928. Beskidenverein did not accept Polish Tatra Association's authority to decide on the location of new huts and, as a legal purchaser of the appropriate land, commenced construction after obtaining the necessary administrative permits. By the end of 1931, the foundation had been laid, and the structure was winterized to accommodate tourists. It was officially opened in August of the following year (during World War II, it operated under the name Dr. Stonawski-Schutzhaus); after numerous renovations, it continues to serve its purpose to this day.\nIn 1931, the Polish Tourist Association officially recognized all contacts with Beskidenverein as severed. At a meeting of one of the subcommittees, it was also decided, among other things, to demarcate the areas previously allocated to Beskidenverein between its own branches and to request the relevant county offices not to issue building permits without Polish Tatra Association's consent. In a less official manner, the Poles also intended to draw the authorities' attention to what they considered suspicious political activities by Beskidenverein, and the Border Guard was to carefully monitor tourists of German nationality moving along the trails without mountain passes (which were issued only by Polish Tatra Association). Other proposals included conducting a propaganda campaign in the editorial offices of the most popular Polish newspapers, taking action to remove Beskidenverein from the Union of Polish Tourist Associations in Warsaw, and excluding all Beskidenverein members who were also members of Polish Tatra Association from the Polish society.\nThe attitude of the state towards Beskidenverein changed in 1934 when in January Poland and Germany signed a declaration of non-aggression. In 1935, the Ministry of Communication demanded that Polish Tatra Association and Union of Polish Tourist Associations start inviting Beskidenverein as an equal partner to discuss tourist affairs, but the Territorial Conciliation Commission (composed of Polish Tatra Association and Union of Polish Tourist Associations activists) rejected this demand using procedural and regulatory loopholes.\nSome improvement in mutual relations occurred in 1936 – Beskidenverein took into account Polish demands to lower prices in mountain huts, which was aimed at popularizing tourism (for example, in the shelter on Hala Lipowska, Beskidenverein members paid 1.20 złoty for accommodation, non-member tourists paid 2.30 złoty, while school and group trips had significant discounts – 1.50 złoty and the possibility of negotiation down to 0.80 złoty, respectively).\nThe escalation of the international situation cast a shadow on mountain tourism – in 1937, Hala Lipowska was included in the border zone, which resulted in restrictions on tourist traffic; the reason was suspicions of the shelter owners' anti-Polish activities. These suspicions later proved to be unfounded, also in relation to the owner of the nearby shelter on Rysianka, which was officially a \"Polish\" facility. However, since the shelters on Rysianka (located closer to the border) were not included in the border zone, Beskidenverein activists perceived the Polish authorities' move as another harassment towards them. In 1939, due to increasing Polish-German tension, access to the Lipowska moountain hut was completely blocked.\nIn the same year, in Szczyrk, the Beskidenverein skiing championships took place. Thanks to the favorable attitude of the Polish state, a radio broadcast of the event was conducted on the waves of German radio – this was an unprecedented event in the history of sports events in the Silesian Beskids.\nAccording to the last pre-war registry in August 1939, the Polish Beskidenverein had 1882 members – mainly from Upper Silesia, but also from distant cities, including Chojnice, Grudziądz, Gdańsk, Leszno, Poznań, Stanisławów, Toruń, and Warsaw.\n\n\n=== New mountain huts in independent Poland ===\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned shelter on Hala Lipowska, Beskidenverein also acquired further shelters:\n\nKozia Góra (Rodelhütte, commonly known as Stefanka after the name of the Beskidenverein president, Dr. Karol Steffan) – 1926;\nKlimczok (Klementinenhütte) – the facility was leased in 1930 from its previous owner, Baron Klobus from Łodygowice, preempting Polish Tatra Association.\nThere was also a tourist station named Biały Krzyż (White Cross) located in a school building on Salmopolska pass – it was destroyed in 1945 during a skirmish between partisans and German troops.\nIn 1924, a wooden ski shelter was built on Skrzyczne (Rauhkoppe, less commonly known as Skrzycznehütte), which survived until World War II.\nSometimes unconfirmed reports suggest that the mountain hut built in 1935 on Chrobacza Łąka also belonged to Beskidenverein.\n\n\n== Beskidenverein in Czechoslovakia ==\nAfter the fall of Austria-Hungary, the activity of the association continued, even in Czechoslovakia. Separated from the Polish sections by the border, the Czechoslovakian Beskidenverein became practically and formally an independent organization, although it still cooperated with colleagues operating in Poland (Beskidenverein discounts were honored on both sides of the border). The main headquarters of the Czechoslovakian part of the association became Moravian Ostrava.\nAfter World War I, the section in Frýdlant nad Ostravicí ceased to operate, but new ones emerged in places like Fryštát, Kopřivnice, Karviná, and Jablunkov (the latter operated only for a few years), and later also in Fulnek. There were two sections in Cieszyn – on the Czechoslovakian and Polish sides. In 1926, the Beskidenverein sections in Czechoslovakia gathered around 3,500 members (not much fewer than in Poland); the most numerous were from Cieszyn (the former headquarters of pre-war Beskidenverein, which remained on the Czechoslovakian side of the border) and Vítkovice.\nThe Beskidenverein in Czechoslovakia also published its own magazine, with a name reminiscent of the pre-war one – Mitteilungen des Beskidenvereines. Sitz des Hauptvereines Mähr-Ostrau. Sometimes, in promoting tourism, it resorted to modern means – for example, in 1933, a silent film Wir und die Beskiden was presented in Moravian Ostrava. Competitions with mountain themes were also organized by Beskidenverein to encourage hiking.\nAt the time of the creation of Czechoslovakia, Beskidenverein was one of the largest tourist organizations in the country. Its role remained significant throughout the entire period of the Republic, however, similar to in the Polish Republic, the association's activities sometimes met with reluctance and suspicion from the authorities, to which German activists reacted similarly. Nationalistic accents, which Beskidenverein never fully wanted to abandon, created constant conflicts, as did matters of signage and markings – under pressure from Czechoslovakian authorities, Germans were forced to replace German descriptions with bilingual ones, but they did so with great resistance.\n\n\n=== Cooperation with other German tourist associations ===\nIn the new conditions of the Czechoslovak Republic, Germans, as the ruling nation, became the largest national minority. In order to defend common interests, broader cooperation became necessary, also among German tourist associations, of which there were dozens in Czechoslovakia.\nIn 1920, in Ústí nad Labem, the Union of German Mountain and Hiking Clubs in the Czechoslovak Republic (Hauptverband deutscher Gebirgs- und Wandervereine in der Tschechoslowakischen Republik, HDGW) was founded, which was to represent German organizations before the government in Prague. Czechoslovak sections of the Beskidenverein joined the union in 1923 – members were entitled to discounts on railway journeys, various benefits in different places in Czechoslovakia, facilitations in border traffic with Germany, accident insurance, and the possibility of receiving state subsidies (which, however, were rarely granted and were small). German mountain and hiking organizations, after initial resistance (mainly regarding the amount of contributions), willingly joined the HDGW, and in 1928, 51 organizations belonged to it, almost all operating in Czechoslovakia. The activities of the union focused, apart from contacts with the government, on joint promotion of tourism, especially among German youth (hiking camps were organized in Germany), and jointly organized large events such as German Hiking Day. HDGW published its own monthly tourist magazine Deutsches Bergland.\nIn 1938, all German mountain associations in Czechoslovakia and almost all hiking associations belonged to the union – a total of 83 associations, with 70,000 members. HDGW operated until the annexation of the Sudetenland by the Third Reich, and then under a changed name and in changed political conditions until 1942.\nIn addition to the general Czechoslovak cooperation, Beskidenverein also decided to create an agreement between mountain associations of Moravia, Silesia, and Slovakia. It was to include, among others, the Carpathian Association (Karpathenverein, KV) and MSSGV. Initially, the main goal was to exchange discounts between organizations (there was no mutual discount exchange in HDGW; individual associations regulated it in separate agreements between themselves). Until 1922, there was an old pre-war agreement between Beskidenverein and MSSGV – after a three-year break, the Czech Beskidenverein granted discounts in its shelters to members of MSSGV sections from Opava.\nIn 1928, a meeting of representatives from both sides of the border, as well as from KV and MSSGV, and representatives of Polish and Czechoslovak authorities took place in Český Těšín. It was decided to establish a free working group without official status (Arbeitsgemanschatf), which informally also included the Kłodzko Mountain Association, and the Polish Beskidenverein ultimately remained outside the group but could always count on its \"help and support\". It was agreed that mutual discounts in tourist facilities would take the form of supplementary stamps affixed to the membership cards of their respective organizations (Polish Beskidenverein and Karpathenverein joined this system in 1931). Initially, there was not much interest in the discounts (for example, in 1930, only 49 out of 1444 members of MSSGV in Opava purchased Beskidenverein stamps). Czech sections of Beskidenverein also signed mutual discount agreements with the Prague Tourist Club and the Alpine Association Donauland. In addition to the discount issues, the working group worked on a proposal for free border crossing between Poland and Czechoslovakia based on tourist ID cards, which was to be presented to the governments in Warsaw and Prague, but these demands were not understood by the authorities until the outbreak of World War II. The working group also planned to cooperate with the Czechoslovak Tourist Club and the Pohorská jednota \"Radhošť\". Furthermore, MSSGV and GGV promised to promote the Beskids in the main areas of their activity.\nIn the 1930s, the activity of the working group significantly declined. In 1934, the Ost und West cell was established, which was to organize group trips for members of Beskidenverein and Karpathenverein to the Jeseníky Mountains, and for MSSGV to the Beskids and Carpathians. In 1937, trips to the Tatra Mountains were planned, but it is not known whether they took place. The last meeting of the working group took place in Moravská Ostrava in 1938, and after the Sudetenland was annexed to the Reich, it ceased to exist.\nSome mountain sections also had winter sports sections, which were part of the Union of German Winter Sports Clubs (Hauptverband der deutschen Wintersportvereine). There were 8 such sections – in Vítkovice, Český Těšín, Karviná, Moravská Ostrava, Bohumín, Frýdek, Místek, and Kopřivnice.\n\n\n=== Beskidenverein mountain huts in Czechoslovakia ===\n\nAfter a few years of inactivity due to the uncertain situation on the border and lack of funds, the Beskidenverein resumed investments in accommodation facilities, although not as large as before the war.\n\nThe mountain hut on Czantoria Wielka (Großer Czantory-Berg) now lay in the border zone between Czechoslovakia and Poland. Plundered and devastated in 1918, it underwent renovation and reopened in 1923;\nAt Biały Krzyż, Germans purchased additional land and erected a two-story hotel, Weisse Kreuz, in 1924 (the foundation stone was laid as early as 1914). The structure was wooden and fell victim to a fire in 1936. Even earlier, in 1927, the old facility from 1902 burned down, leaving tourists without accommodation. Fortunately, Weisse Kreuz was insured for a large sum, and in 1937, the grand opening of the new, luxurious modernist-style Berghotel was celebrated;\non Lysá hora (Lysa-Berg–Kalhberg), the Erzherzog–Albrecht–Schutzhaus began to run out of space for all those in need, prompting the Beskidenverein to build a new accommodation facility, the Steinerne Haus, in 1933. Additionally, in 1926, the Ostrauer Hütte underwent significant expansion;\nThe Cieszyn section built a small mountain hut on Skalka near Mosty u Jablunkova in just three months in 1928;\nThe Hadaszczok-Hütte on Slavíč Mountain was taken over by the Bohumin section from the Vitkovice section, and after renovation in 1936, it was reopened to tourists; Josef Ruminsky became the lessee. Near the old shelter, a new Czech facility, Kolářova chata Slavíč, was opened in 1931; the owner was Jan Kolář, a former policeman from Moravia and former lessee at Hadaszczok-Hütte since 1910.\n\n\n=== Beskidenverein on the eve of war ===\nSimilarly to Poland, some members of the Beskidenverein became associated with the pan-German and Nazi movements in the 1930s, which were particularly active in the Sudetenland. They were involved in parties such as the Deutsche Nationalpartei, Sudetendeutsche Partei, and Deutsche Nationalsozialistische Arbeiterpartei. The Bohumin section was the most involved, closely monitored by the Czechoslovak police, who inspected the German premises several times. However, it turned out that even in this section, neither the leadership nor the majority of members belonged (at least formally) to the aforementioned parties.\nAfter the Polish annexation of Trans-Olza in 1938, several Beskidenverein mountain huts also found themselves within the borders of Poland – facilities on Jaworowy, Skalka, Slavíč Mountain, and Czantoria Wielka. However, there is no information about changes in the administration of these huts; they were managed by sections from areas that also became part of Poland – Cieszyn and Bohumin.\n\n\n== Beskidenverein in the Weimar Republic ==\nThe situation of Beskidenverein in the German Reich became most difficult, as only three of the former German sections remained – in Bytom and Racibórz, which quickly ceased their activities, and in Wrocław. The distance and political obstacles caused the Wrocław section to necessarily limit its activity. In 1924, it became part of the Working Group of Silesian Mountain Societies (Arbeitsgemeinschaft der schlesischen Gebirgsvereine), an agreement between mountain associations in Wrocław, where common event dates were coordinated, joint appeals to the authorities regarding railway connections were made, and joint conferences were organized. Little is known about the participation of Beskidenverein members in these efforts, but it is known that the Working Group itself still existed in 1942.\n\n\n== Beskidenverein during World War II ==\nIn November 1939, the manager of the association, Dr. Edward Stonawski, became the provisional administrator of the Babiogórski Branch of the Polish Tourist and Sightseeing Association (Beskidenverein also took over the branch's assets after Polish Tatra Association was dissolved), and Beskidenverein later received several Polish mountain huts (though significantly fewer than it had expected). These were located in Polish territories incorporated into the Third Reich, although the association also sought a building in Markowe Szczawiny located in the General Government. Dr. Stonawski invoked the merits of his organization and maintained contact with the previous owner, Rudolf Wielgus, whom they wanted to keep in his position. However, in the autumn of 1940, Markowe Szczawiny was taken over by the newly established Kraków branch of the German Alpine Club (Zweig Krakau des Deutschen Alpenvereins). Additionally, the shelter under Babia Góra was handed over to the Slovak Border Guard, which was a severe loss for the association, as they had hoped for its return to German management or at least its transfer to the Karpathenverein, an organization operating in Slovakia.\n\n\n=== Establishment of the Main Beskid Association ===\nInitially, after the war ended, Beskidenverein and its leadership received praises as an organization that had been a pioneering force in the fight for the German Beskids and German territory.\nHowever, it quickly became apparent that the German authorities viewed Beskidenverein rather suspiciously. Nonetheless, Dr. Stonawski hoped that his organization would become the main administration for all German mountain associations in the Beskids. However, this did not happen. Firstly, in September 1939, the former Czechoslovak Beskidenverein was subordinated to the all-German association of mountain and hiking clubs (Reichsverband der Deutschen Gebirgs- und Wandervereine) based in Ústí nad Labem. Then, in June 1940, a founding meeting of the new Main Beskid Association (Beskidenhauptverein in Teschen) was held in Cieszyn, with its headquarters to be located in this town on the Olza river, where it was decided that individual associations from the Polish and Czechoslovak sides would become branches of this organization. However, Edward Stonawski was not elected president; instead, Dr. Krueger, the starosta of Cieszyn, was chosen.\nIn the course of establishing the joint association, the names of its members were specified – the Main Beskid Association in Cieszyn (Hauptverein Beskidenverein), while the remaining were designated as \"branches\" rather than \"sections\" (Zweigstelle Beskidenverein). In practice, the \"old\" Beskidenverein was subordinated to German administration and reduced to the role of one of the smaller organizations subordinate to the central association in the Reich.\nThe following branches became part of the merged association: Bielsko, Fryštát, Frýdek, Karviná, Bohumin, Cieszyn, and Pszczyna from Silesia, Morawska Ostrawa, Mistek, and Vítkovice from the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, as well as Kopřivnice, Fulnek, Bílovec, Nový Jičín, and Opava from the Sudetenland. Attempts were also made to reactivate the branch in Katowice and former sections in Racibórz, Królewska Huta, and Bytom, as well as to establish a new one in Gliwice. The establishment of a branch in Zabrze (Hindenburg) was successful.\nIt is difficult to estimate the number of association members during the war – it is known that the Bielsko branch had between 1500 and 1800 members from 1940 to 1942.\nThe last manifestation of activity was a brochure published in 1943, prepared to mark the half-century existence of Beskidenverein. Dr. Stonawski authored it, summarizing the history of the association briefly. \"Beskidenverein in the Polish era fulfilled its duty as a German association and during that time paved the way for German identity in the east\". In April of that year, the main branch from Moravian Ostrava was removed from the register of associations.\n\n\n=== Former Polish and Czechoslovakian mountain huts under German administration ===\nThe division of shelters was decided by the president of Katowice in agreement with the Eastern Commissioner, as authorized to take action in the areas newly annexed to the Reich. Most of them belonged to the Polish Tatra Association before the war, although the Germans took over both private huts and those that were within the borders of Czechoslovakia until 1938.\nTo the great disappointment of the association members, many facilities were given to other German organizations, not always related to tourism. Shelters on Kozubová (located in Czechoslovakia but managed by the Polish Tourist Society Beskid from Cieszyn), Malá Prašivá, and Ropička (Czechoslovak) were taken over by the Regional Youth Hostels Association in Silesia (Landesjugendherbergsverband Schlesien). The building in Zwardoń was taken over by the National Socialist Labour Organization Strength Through Joy for a short period until August 1940. Przysłop pod Baranią Górą was taken over by the State Forestry Administration, which leased it to the Winter Sports Club from Katowice, while the shelter on Velký Polom (previously in Czechoslovakia until 1938) was placed under the administration of the Regional Transport Association (Landesverkehrsverband), an industrial organization operating in various parts of the Reich, with the intention of establishing a Mountain Guest House there.\nThe Cieszyn branch of Beskidenverein received former Czechoslovak facilities on Gírová (Schutzhaus auf der Girova) and Ostrý (Schutzhaus auf dem Ostry), as well as Polish ones on Stożek Wielki and Równica. In the latter mountain hut, in exchange for signing Volksliste, the previous manager Rudolf Hulanik was allowed to remain. The attendance at Równica was high during the war, and besides the German language, Polish was also heard, which was tolerated by Hulanik.\nA new branch was established in Żywiec, with Dr. Hering, the district administrator of Żywiec, as its chairman. He administered the former Polish huts on Przegibek and Hala Boracza (which belonged to the Jewish Sports Association \"Makkabi\" before the war), and later also in Zwardoń. The branch renovated the facility on Wielka Racza and built a new utility building. Since 1940, with Hering's approval, Bronisław Jarosz resumed his management of the mountain hut as before the war. Thanks to his efficient management, the hut was properly maintained until the end of the war, and it was only after the Germans withdrew that looters destroyed it.\nThe Bielsko branch received only Hala Miziowa, and later Leskowiec, until a decision was made about its further affiliation (this decision was never made, and the shelter remained under the Beskidenverein's control until the end of the war). Due to its poor technical condition, lack of water, and its location in a heavily forested area, it did not accept tourists, and the previous caretaker, Jan Targosz, only ensured it was not completely destroyed. Perhaps in the future, the project for a shelter on Malinowska Skała, initiated by the president of Zabrze (who was also the president of the Zabrze branch), would also come under the administration of the union. However, the construction initiative never went beyond the planning stage.\nThe situation was different for private huts not belonging to the Polish Tatra Association. Skrzyczne was managed by a person of German origin, and it was often quartered there by the Wehrmacht. A similar situation (pre-war German owners – Naturfreunde organization) existed in Błatnia. Rysianka was officially a hut operating under the auspices of the Polish Tatra Skiing Association from Kraków, but the land and building remained the property of a private individual, Gustaw Pustelnik. He provided many services to the Third Reich (probably spying for the Germans before the war), so during the occupation, he retained control of the hut, turning it into a rest house for soldiers and organizing military skiing courses. Similarly, the shelter on Soszów belonged to private individuals – the Gajdzic family. Taking advantage of the owner's departure for forced labor, and later his call-up to the Wehrmacht, the Zabrze branch of Beskidenverein forced the owner's wife to lease the facility. However, they were unable to completely get rid of the former owners.\nEven in shelters that belonged to the Beskidenverein before the war, the military or members of nationalist-socialist organizations were often quartered. For example, Hitler Youth members were stationed at Biały Krzyż, theoretically to assist in protecting the facilities from potential partisans, but towards the end of the war, when there was a threat, they quickly evacuated from the hut.\nThe benefits that the Beskidenverein derived from the mountain huts were purely prestigious (Polish owners who remained in their positions were supposed to take care of their technical condition and submit monthly reports on their activities – they were not entitled to compensation). The turnovers were small, although some pre-war tourists, numerous Germans, and military patrols (especially near the border with Slovakia) appeared in some facilities. The main source of income was the sale of alcohol. The profits were enough to maintain the caretakers, but not for more active operations. Moreover, groups of partisans often appeared in the forests. Towards the end of the war, the activity of the society practically ceased. Dr. Stonawski himself admitted several times in his letters that in the face of the difficult situation, the Beskidenverein was helpless – there were few tourists, restrictive regulations hindered movement, and many facilities were actually requisitioned for the needs of the German military and remained in the organization's records only on paper.\nThe Hitler period also marked the end of active cooperation between German tourist organizations – individual associations competed with each other for influence. Often, current politics were not determined by the needs of tourism but by the ambitions of the leader of a particular section or branch. Many organizations ceased to exist due to the decline in tourist traffic, lack of funds, or were forcibly incorporated into a larger association that was easier for the authorities to control. Additionally, the former system of discount exchange was greatly restricted – the Beskidenverein had a relevant agreement only with the Moravian-Silesian Sudeten Mountain Association, concluded in 1941.\n\n\n== End of Beskidenverein's existence ==\n\nAfter World War II, the assets of the organization in Poland were often destroyed and plundered, and what remained of them was taken over by the Polish Tatra Association, and then by the Polish Tourist and Sightseeing Society, which remains its owner to this day. All the facilities are still operational (with the exception of the mountain hut on Babia Góra and the tourist station at Salmopolska pass), but they have been rebuilt – the hut on Hala Lipowska differs the most from the original.\nIn Czechoslovakia, the local branches of Beskidenverein were dissolved by the decree of the Ministry of Internal Affairs dated 20 May 1945. Then, based on Beneš decrees, the German residents were expelled, and their property (including mountain huts) was nationalized and transferred to various organizations, both tourist (such as the Czechoslovak Tourists Club) and employee-owned. Most of them survived to the present day.\nThe state took over the facilities on Biały Krzyż, as well as the nearby Baron hotel (now on the Slovak side of the border under the name Kysuca), because its owner collaborated with the Germans during World War II. The former Berghotel was handed over to trade unions as a place of recreation for the \"working people\". Currently (in 2016), after thorough renovation, it operates as an apartment building.\nSteinerne Haus on Lysá hora still exists to this day (run by Czech Tourists Club) and serves tourists as Bezručova chata na Lysé hoře, unlike the building patronized by Archduke Albrecht, which burned down in 1972. Ostrauer Hütte, now Ostravská chata, still operates on the red trail leading to the peak. The first mountain hut built by Beskidenverein on Javorový vrch (which also operated during World War II under the name Schutzhaus Ahornberg) is very popular, especially in winter (there is also a ski resort nearby).\nThe mountain hut on Skałka, used by the Czech Tourists Club, although it burned down twice after the war, looks like it did on its opening in the 1920s – it was always thoroughly rebuilt. Hadaszczok-Hütte no longer exists – it burned down during World War II (it is known that it still hosted tourists in 1942), or, according to other sources, the building was dismantled only in 1949 due to significant damage and attack by wood pests. Only the foundations remain, located near the still-operating Kolářova chata Slavíč hut. On the other hand, the moutnain hut on Czantoria Wielka, now in private hands, after the opening of the border crossing and especially after Poland joined the Schengen Area, became a very popular destination for trips from the Polish side, although only a buffet operates there (without accommodation).\nMost of the members and activists of Beskidenverein fled to Germany before the advancing Red Army and often joined associations of compatriots, while those who were active in German parties before the war also joined the Federation of Expellees. In Poland, however, Stonawski managed to stay. Although the authorities of the People's Republic of Poland brought him to trial, they did not prove a direct connection to fascist activities or harm to Poles. Immediately after the war, he wrote a letter to the Polish Tatra Association, asking to be buried near the mountain hut on Hala Lipowska, facing Pilska and Babia Góra, but the Polish Tatra Association Central Board replied that they would not deal with this matter. Dr. Stonawski lived in Bielsko, engaging in charitable activities for German residents and glorifying the former activities of the Beskidenverein. He died in 1966 in a mountain accident and was buried in the family tomb in Skoczów.\nIn West Germany, the memory of Beskidenverein remained vivid for many years after its dissolution – commemorative albums and books were published long after its existence.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDziedzic, Marcin (2006).

        "content": "Rundle Burges Watson (1809 – 5 July 1860) was a British Royal Navy captain.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWatson eldest son of Captain Joshua Rowley Watson (1772–1810), was born in 1809. He entered the navy in November 1821, and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant on 7 October 1829. He afterwards served on the coast of Portugal and on the North American station, till in November 1837 he was appointed to the Calliope frigate, with Captain Thomas Herbert. After two years on the coast of Brazil the Calliope was sent to China, where she was actively employed during the first Chinese war. On 6 May 1841 Watson was promoted to the rank of commander, and was moved with Herbert to the Blenheim; and while in her was repeatedly engaged with the enemy, either in command of boats or landing parties. On 23 December 1842 he was advanced to post rank, and the next day, 24 December, was nominated a C.B. From February 1846 to October 1849 he commanded the Brilliant, a small frigate, on the Cape of Good Hope station; and in December 1852 was appointed to the Impérieuse, a new 50-gun steam frigate, then, and for some years later, considered one of the finest ships in the navy. In 1854 she was sent up the Baltic in advance of the fleet, Watson being senior officer of the squadron of small vessels appointed to watch the breaking up of the ice, and to see that no Russian ships of war got to sea. It was an arduous service well performed. The Impérieuse continued with the flying squadron in the Baltic during the campaigns of 1854 and 1855. After the peace she was sent to the North American station, and returned to England and was paid off early in 1857. In June 1859 Watson was appointed captain-superintendent of Sheerness dockyard, where he died on 5 July 1860. He was married and left issue; his son, Captain Burges Watson, R.N., is now (1899) superintendent of Pembroke Dockyard.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1899). \"Watson, Rundle Burges\".

        "content": "Aletes (Greek: Ἀλήτης), sometimes referred to as Aletos or Alidath, was an individual of disputed origin who lived in the southeast of the Iberian Peninsula in the times preceding the foundation of Qart Hadasht –Cartagena– by the Carthaginian general Asdrubal the Fair in 227 BC, and whose discovery of silver mines in the vicinity of that city earned him a deification by his peers.\nThe only source about this person is a brief account by the Greek historian Polybius during the topographical description of Cartagena for volume X of his Histories, in which he cites Aletes as a local hero to whom, after the aforementioned deification, one of the foundational hills, which currently corresponds to the hill of San José, was consecrated.\nThe existence of a temple dedicated to him on that promontory is not certain in view of Polybius' laconism in this respect, but this has not prevented several authors from suggesting his possible presence crowning the sacred precinct.\n\n\n== Historiographical debate ==\nContemporary historiography has found in the mining deity a motive for discussion, both about its ethnic origin and its possible non-historicity. Thus, in 1930 the German archaeologist and historian Adolf Schulten wanted to see in it an Etruscan influence on the peoples of Levante, in a theory that has not found academic support. The position of the Frenchman Stéphane Gsell, who in 1920 stated that in the case of Aletes it could be an Iberian name, and whose hypothesis was supported since the 1960s by Spanish historians thanks to the advances in the identification of the Iberian scripts, has obtained more support.The last point of controversy came in 1982, when the German Michael Koch introduced the theory that Aletes did not exist as a real person, in a position generally contested by Hispanic historiography, headed by José María Blázquez Martínez. Within this historiography, Ignasi Garcés also states that the fact that the Carthaginians respected the Iberian nomenclature of the hill is an example of an attempt to integrate the indigenous stratum of the city into their new regime, which resulted in the strengthening of the political power of the Barcids in the region.In 2015 an article was published on the influence of astronomy in the urban planning of Cartagena during Antiquity, in which a group of archaeologists and historians suggested that the monumentalisation programme undertaken in the Roman-imperial period may have been conditioned by the attempt to link the Emperor Augustus with Aletes through the orientation of the forum and the curia. Thus, during the summer solstice –a period of the year solemnised by Semitic peoples– the sunrise, as seen from these constructions, occurs over the nearby mountain associated with the discoverer of the silver mines.\n\n\n== See also ==\nIberian religion\nMastia\nSierra Minera de Cartagena-La Unión\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Gangneung nongak is the nongak musical tradition in Gangneung, Gangwon Province, South Korea. It was designated as an important intangible cultural property in 1985.\nIt is a representative nongak with the characteristics of nongak in the east of the Taebaek Mountains in Gangwon-do. In the Gangneung area, various nongak such as Dapgyo Nongak during the Lunar New Year's Day, Geogung Nongak at the beginning of the year, and Gimjeok (dure) Nongak were handed down. Since 1961, it has been widely known as an important intangible cultural asset since it has appeared and won several national folk competitions, and as of 1998, Park Ki-ha (Sangsoe) and Kim Yong-hyun (泫) have been designated as holders of the entertainment industry.\n\n\n== Nongak organization ==\nNongak organization consists of Nong Ki-su, Block Lead, Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Sangsoe), Bu-soe, Samssoe, Collection, Janggo-su, Daebuk-su, Sogo-su, Beopgo-su, and Mudong-dong (Joongae).\n\n\n== Description ==\nIn principle, the iron jab and Beopgo-su wear a bucket hat, and the rest of them wear a cone hat, but now only Mudong uses a cone hat. The jab has a colored band, and the Mudong wears a red skirt, a green jeogori and a navy blue jugori. There are three types of iron music, such as Ilchae (Cheondang-unfair), Samchae, Gutgeori, Gilgunakchilchae, and Gilnongi Garak, but these days, it is rare to play Gilgunakchil, and there is a new Gilnori Garak. Pangut includes mungseok Roll, Hwangdeok Exorcism, Hwangdeok Exorcism Mudongnori, Hwangdeok Exorcism Go Nori, Jin Nori, Farming Pool, Dandong Gori, Samdong Gori, Beopgo Dance, and twelve-legged sangmo. These days, it is rare to stand in a donggori, and instead, there are many farming pools. Farming pool is performed with various farming movements as dances. Gangneung Nongak is different from other Nongak in that Beopgo and Sogo are distinguished, and a lot of Mudongs are organized. The dances of Beopgo, Sogo, and Mudong dominate the pangut. Because of its simple and very fast, it is considered the fastest Nongak in the country, and because most of the dances are run, it is very strong and lively, but there is no laid-back charm.\n\n\n== References ==",

His father and grandfather both bore the praenomen Gaius. His nephew was Gaius Fannius, consul in 122 BC.\n\n\n== Career ==\nStrabo served as praetor in 164 BC. In 161 BC, he became consul together with Marcus Valerius Messalla as his colleague. In that year, laws were passed to restrict luxury and the influence of Hellenic culture. The consuls prohibited Greek philosophers and rhetoricians from staying in Rome. He also introduced the Lex Fannia, a law that restricted dinner expenses, the types of food that were served, and the number of guests. These laws were inspired and encouraged by the conservative politician, Cato the Elder.\nIn 158 BC, Strabo was sent on a diplomatic mission to Illyria in response to Dalmatian piracy. However, the Dalmatians were hostile, and Strabo was forced to flee to safety.\nIn 154 BC, Strabo served in one of three diplomatic missions to Asia Minor, in an attempt to end the war between King Prusias II of Bithynia and Attalus II of Pergamon, failing too, in this undertaking.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "James Robertson-Walker (22 June 1783 – 26 October 1858) was a British Royal Navy captain.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nRobertson-Walker was born on 22 June 1783, was eldest son of James Robertson, deputy-lieutenant of Ross-shire, and for many years collector of the customs at the port of Stornoway. His mother was Annabella, daughter of John Mackenzie of Ross. He probably served for some few years in merchant ships; he entered the navy in April 1801 as able seaman on board the Inspector sloop at Leith, but was moved into the Princess Charlotte frigate, in which, as midshipman and master's mate, he served for two years on the Irish station. In May 1803 he joined the Canopus, the flagship of Rear-admiral George Campbell off Toulon in 1804. From her in March 1805 he was moved to the Victory, in which he was present in the battle of Trafalgar. When the Victory was paid off in January 1806, Robertson was sent, at the request of Captain Hardy, to the Thames frigate, in which he went out to the West Indies; there in April 1807 he was moved to the Northumberland, the flagship of Sir Alexander Forrester Inglis Cochrane, with whom in December he went to the Belle-Isle. In April 1808 he was appointed acting-lieutenant of the Fawn, in which, and afterwards in the Hazard sloop, he was repeatedly engaged in boat actions with the batteries round the coast of Guadeloupe. On 21 July 1809 his rank of lieutenant was confirmed. He continued in the Hazard till October 1812, and was over and over again engaged with the enemy's batteries, either in the boats or in the ship herself. Several times he won the approval of the admiral, but it did not take the form of promotion; and in October 1812 he was appointed to the Antelope, the flagship of Sir John Thomas Duckworth. In her in 1813 he was in the Baltic, and in November was moved to the Vigo, the flagship of Rear-admiral Graham Moore. A few weeks later the Vigo was ordered to be paid off, and in February 1814 Robertson was sent out to North America for service on the lakes.\nIn September he joined the Confiance, a ship newly launched on Lake Champlain, and being fitted out by Captain George Downie. The English army of eleven thousand men, under the command of Sir George Prevost, had advanced against Plattsburg on the Saranac, then held by an American force estimated at two thousand men, but supported by a strong and heavily armed flotilla. Prevost sent repeated messages urging Downie to co-operate with him in the reduction of this place, and in language which, coming from an officer of Prevost's rank, admitted of no delay. The Confiance was not ready for service, her guns not fitted, her men made up of drafts of bad characters from the fleet, and only just got together when she weighed anchor on 11 Sept., and, in company with three smaller vessels and ten gunboats, crossed over to Plattsburg Bay. The American squadron was of nearly double the force; but Downie, relying on the promised co-operation of Prevost, closed with the enemy and engaged. But Prevost did not move; the gunboats shamefully ran away; one of the small vessels struck on a reef; Downie was killed; and Robertson, left in command, was obliged to surrender after the Confiance had sustained a loss of forty-one killed and eighty-three wounded, out of a complement of 270, and was herself sinking. Sir James Lucas Yeo, the naval commander-in-chief, preferred charges of gross misconduct against Prevost, who, however, died before he could be brought to trial. At the peace Robertson returned to England, was tried for the loss of the Confiance, and honourably acquitted. The next day, 29 August 1815, he was promoted to the rank of commander. He had no further service; on 28 July 1851 he was promoted to be captain on the retired list, and died on 26 October 1858. On 24 June 1824 he married, first, Ann, only daughter and heiress of William Walker of Gilgarran, near Whitehaven, and thereupon assumed the name of Walker. He married, secondly, Catherine (d. 1892), daughter of John Mackenzie of Ross. He left no issue.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1899). \"Walker, James Robertson-\". In Lee, Sidney (ed.).

As well as officiating in South Africa, he also took charge of 10 matches in Super Rugby between 1996 and 2001 and three tests between 1996 and 1998. In May 2001, Spannenberg was charged with \"driving under the influence of alcohol\". He was also accused of sexual assault against a Griquas player following a Vodacom Cup match against the Blue Bulls in April 2001. On 11 November 2001, he went on a boat ride with friends at Zeekoevlei. He reportedly jumped from the boat and drowned; a friend who almost drowned trying to save him was rescued by divers and taken to hospital. Spannenberg's body was found three days later. A minute's silence was held at the Durban Sevens tournament at which he was due to officiate the following weekend.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nProfile at ESPNscrum",

        "content": "Thomas George Shortland (10 May 1771 – 1827) was a British Royal Navy captain.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nShortland was the brother of Captain John Shortland. He was born at Portsea on 10 May 1771. In January 1785 he entered the navy on board the Irresistible, then flying the broad pennant of Sir Andrew Snape Hamond in the Channel. In March 1787 he was moved to the Alexander, one of the little squadron going out to New South Wales with Commodore Arthur Phillip, and served in her till her return to England in May 1789. He was then employed in the Channel and North Sea, and on 19 November 1790 was promoted to be lieutenant of the Speedy sloop. In January 1793 he was appointed to the Nemesis frigate, which accompanied the fleet under Lord Hood to the Mediterranean. In September 1794 he was moved into the Romney, with Sir Charles Hamilton, whom, in April 1795, he followed to the Melpomene. On the night of 3–4 August 1798 he commanded the boats of the frigate in cutting out the Aventurier armed brig from under the batteries in the bay of Corréjou, on the north coast of Brittany—a gallant exploit, for which he was promoted to the rank of commander on 20 April 1799, and appointed to the Voltigeur sloop on the Newfoundland station. In the summer of 1801 he was appointed temporarily to the 80-gun ship Donegal, then in dock at Plymouth, and, as a reward for his extraordinary exertions in fitting her for sea, was made acting captain of the Dédaigneuse frigate, in which rank and command he was confirmed on 1 March 1802. He then took the ship out to the East Indies, but was compelled by ill-health to return to England in the spring of 1803. He was afterwards for a short time captain of the Britannia, and of the Cæsar, bearing the flag of Sir Richard John Strachan. In the summer of 1806 he joined the Canopus, as flag-captain to Sir Thomas Louis, and commanded that ship when she led the squadron of Sir John Thomas Duckworth through the Dardanelles in February and March 1807. After the death of Louis, Shortland continued for some months in command of the Canopus, but in September 1807 was moved into the Queen, still in the Mediterranean, and remained in her till the end of 1808. In 1809 he commanded the Valiant in the expedition to the Scheldt; in 1810–11 the Iris frigate, off Cadiz and in the West Indies; and in 1812–13 the Royal Oak as flag-captain to Lord Amelius Beauclerk. In November 1813 he was appointed agent for prisoners-of-war at Dartmoor; from April 1816 to April 1819 he was captain-superintendent of the ordinary at Plymouth; and for the next three years was comptroller-general of the preventive boat service. On 14 July 1825 he was appointed resident commissioner at Jamaica, where he died towards the end of 1827. He married Elizabeth, daughter of Peter Tonkin of Plymouth, and by her had a large family. Three of his sons, Edward, Peter Frederick, and Willoughby, are separately noticed.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1886). \"Shortland, Thomas George\".

        "content": "Muhammad Tauseef Ahmed (2 April 1992 – 27 February 2017) was a Pakistani footballer who played as a midfielder. Tauseed earned three international caps with Pakistan, and scored one goal. He was the first-ever goal scorer for Pakistan against Palestine in the entire history of international soccer circuit. Tauseef also represented Pakistan at the 2010 Asian Games and the 2012 Summer Olympics qualifiers.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nAhmed was born on 2 April 1992, and hailed from Faisalabad in the Punjab province of Pakistan.\n\n\n== Club career ==\nTauseef raised to fame at the Geo Super Football League in 2007 while representing Islamabad United, where he helped the side to be crowned champions. He then represented WAPDA in the Pakistan Premier League. He was also gold medallist for WAPDA in the 2011 National Games of Pakistan. Ahmed also captained WAPDA, and was known as one of the most dependable players of the squad. He also played for his hometown club Lyallpur.\n\n\n== International career ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nTauseef was first called by the Pakistan national under-23 team for 2010 Asian Games, followed by a tour in Thailand in 2011. He then played against Malaysia in January 2011, at the first leg of the 2012 Summer Olympics qualifiers.\nIn 2011, he received a call-up for the senior team for a series of friendlies against Palestine. In the first match down 0–2, Pakistan in the 36th minute was awarded a penalty kick which was converted by Tauseef at the top right corner to seal a goal at Palestine goalkeeper and captain Abdullah Al-Saidawi. Palestine ended winning the match by 2–1 at the Punjab Stadium in Lahore. Tauseef's goal was also first for Pakistan in international arena since 8 December 2009 at the 2009 SAFF Championship. He also halted the agony of missed penalties that put out Pakistan from three events. Adnan Ahmed  had previously missed a crucial penalty against Sri Lanka at the 2009 SAFF Championship. Months later, Abdul Aziz and Abbas Ali missed penalties against the same opposition giving more worrying moments to coach Gyorgy Kottan in the 2010 South Asian Games. Third incident occurred in the 2010 Asian Games when former captain Samar Ishaq saw his 84th penalty kick blocked by Maldives keeper Imran Mohamed as Maldives held Graham Roberts coached Pakistan to a goalless draw.\n\n\n=== Injury ===\n\nIn the second encounter against Palestine on 4 March 2011 at the Peoples Football Stadium in Karachi ending in a goalless draw, Tauseef broke his posterior cruciate ligament.\nAfter over four months since the injury, Tauseef was reportedly still suffering with no help in sight. With no facility of health insurance available to the players, the Pakistan Football Federation were unwilling to address the issue while the injury threatened to end Tauseef's career. Tauseef's department club WAPDA couldn't help either, as the former was just a contractual player instead of a permanent employee of the company. Tauseef meanwhile was left to his own to address the issue and ease the pain.\n\n\n=== Return to international football ===\nOn 6 February 2015, Tauseef returned to international arena for a friendly against Afghanistan as a starter, ending in a 2–1 victory for Pakistan.\nTauseef then missed international exposure for the next years, as since March 2015, Pakistan remained suspended from any international competition because of the crisis created inside the Pakistan Football Federation.\n\n\n== Death ==\nTauseef died on 27 February 2017, at the age of 24. He was a diabetes patient, and was taken to a hospital in his hometown of Faisalabad when his sugar level surged after suffering from high fever, and ultimately he succumbed to his illness. One of his coaches stated that he felt a sudden pressure on his kidneys and was taken to hospital, where he expired.\nAhmed was laid to rest in his village in Thikriwala in Faisalabad after Zuhr prayers. He was survived by his parents, an elder brother and four sisters.\n\n\n=== Aftermath ===\nTauseef's death commotioned the Pakistan football community,  with several personalities expressing deep sorrow and condolence over the demise of Tauseef, including his teammates, coaches such as Shahzad Anwar, Nasir Ismail, and national team former captains Muhammad Essa and Tanveer Ahmed. Tariq Lutfi highlighted his importance in the 2012 Summer Olympics qualifiers when he needed a solid midfielder. Former England national team footballer and Pakistan national team coach Graham Roberts stated to Dawn via Twitter: “Tauseef was a great lad who worked very hard and was a pleasure to coach, he was skilful and very competitive. He gave his all when he played.”\n\nThe Pakistan Football Federation faced criticism for its treatment of Tauseef at an age when he should have been flourishing in his football career. His untimely death, caused by avoidable circumstances, highlighted the neglect faced. Despite his efforts to contact PFF officials and even meeting them in person in Lahore, he received no concern or assistance for his injury, feeling abandoned by the organisation. Tauseef's teammate, Naeemullah, lamented the lack of support from PFF in an interview with The Express Tribune.\nAfter his injury, despite assurances from the PFF, he received no financial support or proper medical care. Instead, he was shuffled between inadequate medical practitioners until it was too late. By the time he received proper treatment, the damage was irreversible due to untreated diabetes exacerbated by the neglect of his knee injury. The physical pain from his knee injury paled in comparison to the emotional anguish caused by the PFF's indifference to his plight.\nWAPDA captain and national team striker Arif Mehmood criticised the Pakistan football departments, stating: “We represent these departments but if one gets sick or injured then they are left to rot on their own. Touseef’s case is the same.”\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n=== International ===\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\n\n=== Islamabad United ===\nGeo Super Football League: 2007\nWAPDA\n\nNational Games of Pakistan: 2011\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMuhammad Tauseef Ahmed at Global Sports Archive\nMuhammad Tauseef Ahmed at National-Football-Teams.com",

        "content": "Thomas Smith (died 18 June 1708) was a British Royal Navy captain and renegade.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSmith was the son of English parents. He was born at sea between Holland and England, and was brought up in North Yarmouth. Between 1680 and 1690 he commanded different merchant ships, and in 1691 was commander and one-third owner of a ship trading from Plymouth. He then entered on board the Portsmouth galley and was rated by Captain William Whetstone as a midshipman. His knowledge of the French coast proved useful, and Smith was led by Whetstone, and afterwards by Captain John Bridges, to expect promotion through their recommendation; but on Bridges being wounded and sent to hospital, Smith was put on shore by the first lieutenant, who was acting as captain, and received nothing but his pay ticket as midshipman. In 1693 he shipped as pilot of the St. Martin's prize, and, being discharged from her, married a widow with five young children, whom he was called on to maintain. He then got the command of a transport and carried stores to Kinsale, where he was engaged by Captain John Lapthorne as pilot of the Mercury, which was going off Brest to gain intelligence of the French fleet. Smith was put on shore and returned with exact details of the enemy's fleet, for which service he was paid a grant of 30l., and was promoted to command the Germoon on 22 September 1696. In the Germoon he continued for two years, carrying despatches to the West Indies, and was then ordered to go out with Rear-admiral John Benbow; but was afterwards superseded, and for three years was left unemployed, nor could he get his pay. After the accession of Queen Anne, much to his disappointment, as having expected something better, he was appointed to the Bonetta, a small sloop employed in convoy service in the North Sea—a paltry command which did not, he alleged, compensate him for the loss he had sustained by being kept waiting so long.\nThe grievance was no doubt a real one, and was not uncommon both then and long afterwards. Smith endeavoured to take the remedy into his own hands, and when he had been in the Bonetta about fifteen months, he was charged by his officers and men with many irregularities, such as hiring out the men to merchant ships, taking money for discharging prest men, making false musters, being drunk, and often absent for several days together. On these charges he was tried by court-martial on 1 September 1703, was found guilty, and was dismissed from his command, with a fine of six months' pay. For upwards of two years he continued memorialising the queen, but without success; he then offered himself as a midshipman on board some flagship, but was refused by Sir Clowdisley Shovell, the commander-in-chief of the fleet; and in February 1706–7, being almost destitute, he took a passage in a Swedish ship bound to Lisbon, where he thought he had some interest. Off the Isle of Wight, however, the Swede was overhauled by a Dunkirk privateer, and Smith was taken out of her and carried to Dunkirk. There, apparently without much pressing, he entered the French service, and was appointed to serve—probably as pilot—on board the admiral-galley of the squadron which captured the Nightingale off Harwich on 24 August 1707.\nWhen Jermy was brought on board the admiral-galley, he saw and recognised Smith and threw himself on him, sword in hand, exclaiming ‘Traitor, you shall not escape me as you have done the hangman.’ Jermy, however, was seized and held back, but when Smith angrily desired that the prisoner might be sent to another galley, he was disdainfully told that he might go himself if he liked. The squadron had been intended to attack Harwich, and Smith now urged that the attempt should be made. The French admiral, De Langeron, refused, as the galleys had suffered severely in the engagement with the Nightingale. On their return Smith laid a formal complaint against De Langeron, whose reasons were held to be sufficient. He then suggested that, with the Nightingale and another ship then at Dunkirk, he should be allowed to make the attempt. He accordingly received a commission to command the Nightingale, and on 24 December he put to sea, in company with the Squirrel, another English prize. On the forenoon of the 27th, as they were approaching Harwich, they were sighted and chased by Captain Nicholas Haddock in the Ludlow Castle. After a chase of ten hours the Nightingale was overtaken, and after a short resistance was captured. The Squirrel escaped. Smith, it was said, had wished to blow up the ship, but was forcibly prevented by his men. When taken, he was put on shore at Hull, whence he was sent up to London, tried at the Old Bailey on 2 June 1708, found guilty of bearing arms against his country, was sentenced to death, and was executed on 18 June with all the barbarities directed by law.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1898). \"Smith, Thomas (d.1708)\".

He entered the navy in September 1808 on board the Princess Caroline of 74 guns, and, remaining in her for upwards of four years, served in the North Sea, Baltic, and Channel. In February 1813 he was moved into the Undaunted with Captain Thomas Ussher, whom he accompanied to the Duncan of 74 guns in August 1814. On 20 September 1815 he was promoted to be lieutenant. He afterwards served in the Mediterranean and on the coast of South America till his promotion, on 8 September 1829, to the rank of commander. In 1830 he was appointed to superintend the instruction of officers and seamen in gunnery on board the Excellent at Portsmouth, and was advanced to post rank on 13 April 1832. His connection with the gunnery school at Portsmouth led him to invent a new method of sighting ships' guns, a lever target, and the paddle-box lifeboats, which were widely adopted upon paddle-wheel steamers. In June 1849 he was appointed superintendent of packets at Southampton, where he died, unmarried, on 6 April 1850. He was the author of ‘An Account of the Siege of Antwerp’ (1833) and some minor pamphlets on professional subjects.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1898). \"Smith, George (1797?-1850)\".

        "content": "Dunvegan Bridge is a suspension bridge that crosses the Peace River as part of Alberta Highway 2 between the Municipal District of Fairview No. 136 and Saddle Hills County next to the hamlet of Dunvegan. It is approximately 87 kilometres (54 mi) from the British Columbia border with Fairview to the north and Spirit River to the south. It is the largest and longest suspension bridge in Alberta.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe bridge is made of 4,050 short tons (3,670 metric tons) of steel and 26 cubic yards (20 m3) of concrete. The design features three spans of cable wire and two towers over two lanes of Alberta Highway 2 with a steel railing. The bridge deck has two yellow-painted steel trusses on either side of the roadway.  The bridge is supported by two pillars connected to the towers on either side and two concrete abutments.\n\n\n== History ==\nPrior to the bridge being built, Dunvegan was served by a government installed ferry across the Peace River. The bridge itself was built and opened in 1960. After the opening, the Dunvegan Crossing ferry was moved down to La Crete and served as the Tompkins ferry (still in operation) from 1961 to 1987. This ferry can be seen at the La Crete Mennonite Heritage Village.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of bridges in Canada\n\n\n== Sources ==",

(2024). It was written by Hill, Giampaolo Parisi, Marco Parisi, Charlotte Haining and Mike Kintish, and produced by PARISI.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nIn an interview with Emma Wilkes for NME, Hill said about the track: \"I really hope people connect to this frustrated and isolated love song and still feel like they wanna dance their way through the shared sadness\".\n\n\n== Promotion ==\nAn accompanying music video was released alongside the song the same day, 28 March 2024. The music video was directed by Michael Holyk, an often collaborator of Hill. The music video was filmed in Slovenia. A rave edit of the track was also made available the same day.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\"Outside of Love\" was met with positive reviews by music critics. Dom Vigil of Prelude Press praised the track stating that the song: \"sees Becky at her best: dancefloor-igniting electronica inspired by her underground roots, infused with an arena-filling infectiousness\".  Emma Wilkes of NME dubbed the song as a \"big, anthemic\" track. Likewise, Liam Cattermole of Notion also described the track as \"anthemic\" and praised Hill's \"powerhouse vocals\".\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Wilson Rathborne (16 July 1748 – 1831) was a British Royal Navy captain.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nRathborne was the son of Richard Rathborne, a clergyman. He was born near Loughrea, County Galway, on 16 July 1748. In September 1763 he was entered as an ‘able seaman’ on board the Niger, with Sir Thomas Adams, on the Newfoundland station. As able seaman and midshipman he served for six years in the Niger. He then followed Adams to the Boston, and ten months later to the Romney, in which he returned to England in 1770. In 1773 he joined the Hunter sloop as able seaman, in which rating he continued for a year. He was then a midshipman for some months, and, seeing no prospect of promotion, accepted a warrant as master of the Hunter. It was not till 1780 that he was allowed to return to England, and, having obtained an introduction to the Earl of Sandwich, passed his examination on 16 March; two days later he was promoted to be lieutenant of the Bedford, with Commodore Edmund Affleck. In the Bedford he was present in the actions off the Chesapeake on 16 March and 5 September 1781, at St. Kitts in January, and in the actions under the lee of Dominica on 9 and 12 April 1782. In the summer of 1783 the Bedford returned to England and was paid off. In the armament of 1787 Rathborne was in the Atlas, carrying Affleck's flag, and was afterwards appointed to the Colossus, one of the Channel fleet, in which he remained till 1791. In December 1792 he was appointed to the Captain, in which in the following year he went out to the Mediterranean, took part in the occupation of Toulon, in the reduction of Corsica, and in the action of 14 March 1795, when he was severely wounded in the right arm, and lost his right eye. He was invalided for the recovery of his health, and on 9 November 1795 was promoted to the rank of commander.\nIn 1797 he had command of the Good Design armed ship, convoying the trade from Leith to the Elbe, or to Elsinore. In December 1799 he was appointed to the Racoon brig, which he commanded in the Channel, the Mediterranean, and the West Indies, where, on 18 November 1802, he was posted to the Santa Margarita. He returned to England in the course of 1803, and, remaining in the Santa Margarita, was attached to the Channel fleet. On 4 November 1805 he was in company with Sir Richard John Strachan, when he fell in with the French ships which, under Dumanoir, had escaped from Trafalgar, but now, hampered by the frigates Santa Margarita and Phœnix, were brought to action and all taken. Rathborne almost immediately afterwards received his appointment to the Foudroyant, much to his disgust, as he conceived that a cruising frigate was likely to give him greater opportunities of distinction and prize-money. He appealed to the admiralty, and Captain John Wentworth Loring [q. v.], who was appointed to succeed him in the Margarita, amiably held back his commission till the pleasure of the admiralty could be known. In the end Loring was appointed to the Niobe, and Rathborne remained in the Santa Margarita till December 1807, when the ship, being quite worn out, was paid off. For the next two years Rathborne commanded the sea fencibles of the Essex coast, and from 1810 to 1813 had charge of the impress service in the Tyne. In 1810 he was granted a pension for the loss of his eye, and this was afterwards increased to 300l. a year. In 1815 he was nominated a C.B. In 1822 he was appointed superintendent of the ordinary at Chatham, a post which he held till his death in the summer of 1831. He married, in 1805, a daughter of John French of Loughrea, and left issue. His sister was the mother of John Wilson Croker\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1896). \"Rathborne, Wilson\".
