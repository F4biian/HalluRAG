        "content": "St John the Baptist's Church is the parish church of Low Bentham, a settlement in North Yorkshire, in England.\nA church in Bentham was recorded in the Domesday Book.  It is believed to have been destroyed during a Scottish raid in the early 14th century.  The oldest parts of the current church, the tower and the chancel arch, date from the 1340 rebuild.  The church was restored in 1822, and then largely rebuilt by Richard Norman Shaw between 1876 and 1878.  A porch and new main door were added in 1891.  The church was grade II* listed in 1958.  In 2023, a kitchen and toilets were installed, and the pews were replaced by chairs.\nThe church is built of stone with a slate roof.  It consists of a nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, a north porch, a chancel with a north vestry and a south chapel, and a west tower.  The tower is in Perpendicular style, with three stages, diagonal buttresses, and a west doorway above which is a three light window.  The two-light bell openings have trefoil heads with mouchettes in the spandrels, and hood moulds, and at the top is an embattled parapet with four crocketed pinnacles.  One 15th century window survives in the south wall of the chancel, and two in the south chapel.  In the south chapel wall is a sundial dating from about 1800.The font was designed by William Lethaby and dates from about 1890.  The pulpit is by Shaw, and there is a king post roof dating from his restoration.  The reredos was designed by Shaw and carved by Thomas Earp.  The walls have majolica tiles manufactured by Maw & Co, and there are several windows with stained glass by Heaton, Butler and Bayne.  A south aisle window incorporates a stone crucifix which probably dates from the 13th century.The building contains a coffin slab dating from about 1340; the Kirkbeck Stone dating from the 17th century; and a 15th-century bell hanging in the porch. The church reputedly has the heaviest peal of six bells in Yorkshire, and together weigh 7,500 pounds (3,400 kg). The old organ, which is no longer playable, was built by William Hill of London as a \"house organ\" for Walker Joy, a prosperous oil merchant in Leeds; his brother designed a hydraulic engine to pump the bellows, making it the first ever to be blown by mechanical power.  The organ is due to be removed. The churchyard contains a memorial to Robert Poole, a gravedigger, consisting of a sculptured shovel leaning against a tree trunk.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGrade II* listed buildings in North Yorkshire\nListed buildings in Bentham, North Yorkshire\n\n\n== References ==",

He is the founder of Sudanese archaeology in Germany.\nHintze studied at Humboldt University of Berlin under Hermann Grapow and received his doctorate in 1944.\nIn 1957, he founded the Institute of Egyptology at Humboldt University. He retired in 1980.\nHintze's main area of research was the study of meriotic culture in Nubia. He undertook field research projects at Butana (1957–58) and Musawwarat es-Sufra (1960–1970). Among his students were a generation of Egyptologists, many of whom specialize in the Sudan of antiquity, including Erika Endesfelder, Liselotte Honigmann-zinserling, Irene Shirun-Grumach, Karl-Heinz Priese, Walter-Friedrich Reineke and Steffen Wenig.\nHis wife was German archaeologist Ursula Hintze. Hintze was killed on March 30, 1993, by a car accident.\n\n\n== Books ==\nHintze, Fritz; Hintze, Ursula (1966). Alte Kulturen im Sudan (in German). Callwey.\nHintze, Fritz; Hintze, Ursula (1968).

        "content": "Playa del Carmen is a railway station in Playa del Carmen, Quintana Roo. The station allows transport and tourism to Playa del Carmen with other parts of the Yucatán Peninsula. On 29 February 2024, the station was officially opened. However, the line it is on did not enter service until two weeks later, so the first passengers to the station arrived on 15 March 2024.\nCurrently the station does not have public transport routes, but there is the option of taking a taxi from the center of Playa del Carmen that charges about 100 Mexican pesos. In the future, there will be a shuttle bus service, called the Conexión Intermodal Tren Maya, that will connect to the bus terminal and tourist sites of Playa del Carmen.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Proposals ===\nThe first proposal of the station was presented in 2021, and it was thought that it will be located on the Cancun-Tulum road, in the corner with 38th Avenue. This location had been chosen by President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, to make it a point to increase the number of passengers who will travel on the train, in addition to being an intermediate point between the commercial area and the housing area of the tourist destination.\nThe station was thought of three tracks and two platforms, in its design marine forms, which Fonatur called \"a wave made into a building\" (Spanish: una ola hecha edificio), as it would have undulating forms. The station will be elevated so as not to interfere with the road that would pass under it, and also to enable the construction of a bus station and taxi stand on the ground floor.\nLater, the route of Tren Maya Section 5 North (between Cancún Airport and Playa del Carmen) had to be changed, so the location of the station changed. Although the station remained approximately 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) from Playa del Carmen, the original concept of the station had to be completely discarded. The new station would be commissioned to Grupo ICA, which is  also building Section 5 South, between Playa del Carmen and Tulum.\n\n\n=== Opening ===\nElcar David Lozano Águila, CEO of the Tren Maya company, reported on 29 January 2024 that Section 5 North of the Tren Maya, which runs from Cancún to Playa del Carmen, would be opened on 29 February 2024, with a length of 50.157 kilometres (31.166 mi) of electrified double track.\nThe station was formally inaugurated on 29 February 2024 by the President of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, although it was not opened to the public. The inauguration of the station was the site of clashes between the protests by environmental groups and batons of adherents to the project of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. However, the Tren Maya arrived in Playa del Carmen, where it was received in a medium-sized station after almost two years of work.\nThe X'Trapolis Tsíimin K'áak arrived at the station at 1:55 pm, after almost two hours of travel from Cancún Airport railway station. Two weeks later, on 15 March, the first passengers were able to get off the station on a train from Cancún.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Committee for Public Education v. Nyquist , 413 U.S. 756 (1973), was a United States Supreme Court case which held New York state policies providing repair and maintenance grants to non-public schools, and tuition reimbursement or tax credits to parents of students were Establishment Clause violations. The Court found that the  three New York State programs failed the primary effect prong of the Lemon test.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThree programs providing financial aid to non-public schools were established under several amendments to New York State law in May 1972 providing \"maintenance and repair\" grants to schools, and tuition reimbursement or tax benefits to parents.\nA taxpayer complaint was soon filed in the Southern District of New York claiming the programs violated the Establishment Clause. The district court upheld the constitutionality of the tax benefit but agreed that the direct money grants and tuition reimbursement violated the Establishment Clause. The plaintiffs (appellants) appealed directly to the Supreme Court.\n\n\n== Legal history ==\nSeveral cases decided before Lemon v. Kurtzman had upheld the constitutionality of various provisions that were challenged on Establishment grounds. In these cases the Court considered the benefits to the religious organization were \"indirect\" or \"incidental\".. \nEverson v. Board of Education was the first Supreme Court case that heard a challenge to a state law on Establishment grounds. Justice Hugo Black writing for the majority in Everson upheld a New Jersey state law that reimbursed the parents of parochial school students for transportation costs.\nThe reimbursement to parents provided only an indirect benefit to the schools and student bus fares were \"indisputably marked off from religious function\".\n\n\n== Supreme Court ==\nAll three of the Lemon criteria must be met for a law to be upheld against an Establishment Clause challenge. First, the Court determines whether there is a legitimate secular purpose for the legislation such as a state interest in the general welfare of students.  If the Court finds a legitimate secular purpose, the law may still be unconstitutional if the primary effect advances religion or results in excessive entanglement between government and religious orders. In Nyquist all three provisions failed the second \"primary effect\" prong. There was no entanglement analysis.\n\n\n=== Majority decision ===\nWriting for the majority, Justice Lewis Powell recognized as valid the legislative findings of the statute for all three programs, including the interest in \"promoting pluralism and diversity\" of school choice.\nThe \"maintenance and repair\" expenditures were not restricted  by statue and \"virtually all\" of the recipients were Roman Catholic schools in low-income areas. Distinguishing Everson, Allen and Tilton, the Court found that without restricting the grants to exclusively secular facilities the law \"has a primary effect that advances religion in that it subsidizes directly the religious activities of sectarian elementary and secondary schools.\"\nThe Court found that the tuition reimbursement program failed the effect prong for similar reasons:\n\nIn the absence of an effective means of guaranteeing that the state aid derived from public funds will be used exclusively for secular, neutral, and non ideological purposes, it is clear from our cases that direct aid in whatever form is invalid.\nEven though parents were reimbursed directly for tuition costs the Court distinguished Everson and Allen: \"the fact that aid is distributed to parents rather than schools is only one among many factors to be considered\".\nThe Court ruled against the tax benefit program for the same reason: the program was not \"sufficiently restricted to assure that it will not have the impermissible effect of advancing the sectarian activities of religious schools.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nWalz v.

        "content": "2 Bristol Avenue is a municipal building in Bristol Avenue, Colindale, London. It is the administrative headquarters of Barnet London Borough Council.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe building was commissioned to replace Barnet House in Whetstone as the administrative headquarters of Barnet London Borough Council. Civic leaders had deemed the building in Whetstone as uneconomic to operate as they sought to save circa £1 million a year in accommodation costs. The site that they selected for the new building had previously been part of Hendon Aerodrome, until it was closed in 1968, and was designated by the council as a regeneration area.\nConstruction work on the new nine-storey building commenced in December 2016. It was designed by Hawkins\\Brown in the modern style, built by Galliford Try in concrete, brick and glass at a cost of £36 million and was completed in September 2019.\nThe design involved an asymmetrical main frontage of sixteen bays facing onto Bristol Avenue. The scheme used post-tensioned concrete slabs, which were externally visible, on each of the floors. The bays were fenestrated with tall plate glass windows and flanked by full height brick pilasters. Internally, the principal spaces were the offices for 1,400 council staff, a recreation terrace on the 4th floor where staff could congregate, and a landscaped roof terrace.\nA new public area, to be known as Patterson Square, was established in front of the building on the corner of Bristol Avenue and Grahame Park Way. The public area, which involved provision of public seating, landscaping and a flagpole, was named after Gabrielle Patterson, who was the UK's first woman flying instructor. The choice of name was also intended to recall the connection with Hendon Aerodrome. Patterson instructed trainees on various aircraft included the de Havilland Mosquito and the Vickers Wellington during the Second World War.\n\n\n== References ==",

It enshrines a miraculous image of Saint Vincent Ferrer in the main retablo. The present church is built in 1795 after the main town was founded. It was formerly a barrio of Vigan known as Barrio Tuanong.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1795, it was the installation of the seat of municipality and the church, and Bo. Tuanong became San Vicente de Ferrer . Don Pedro de Leon was the first parish priest and he was believed as the initiator of the construction of the church of San Vicente. Years then, the image of the titular, was found in fishing nets. Devotees report miracles coming from the saint, causing more local devotees to flock at his shrine to ask for favors from him. \n\n\n== Architecture and Style ==\nThe church is baroque in style, with two towers and two layers of columns in the facade. The bell towers with three storeys are octagonal, having a resemblance to the bell tower of Vigan. It has 4 bells hung in each tower. Inside, a pulpit can be found and there are three retablos, one is dedicated to the Virgin Mary, one to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and the image of Vincent Ferrer is enshrined at the central, main retablo.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSan Vicente Church on Facebook",

It was rebuilt in 1825 by John Oates, but was demolished other than the tower in 1888.  The three stage tower survives, and is a grade II listed building.\n\nThe current church was consecrated in January 1889.  It lies half a mile south of the old building.  The small church is in the Decorated Gothic style, and it has an octagonal bellcote.  The chancel has four small windows, which were relocated from the old church.  There is an octagonal font, and an organ built by James Jepson Binns.  The east window contains a depiction of the old church.\n\n\n== See also ==\nListed buildings in Bishop Thornton, Shaw Mills and Warsill\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Transit Orange is the brand name for bus transit services in Orange County, New York. Under the brand name of Transit Orange, mini-systems, mostly municipally-run, serve various towns across Orange County. In addition to these municipal and private services, Transit Orange also owns The Main Line bus, and oversees municipal dial-a-bus operations. Along with Short Line Bus and the Metro-North Port Jervis Line, Transit Orange forms the basis of public transportation in Orange County.\n\n\n== History ==\nBus service in Orange County in 1934, when Newburgh's system was founded. In 1935, Middletown's system commenced operations. Kiryas Joel's system likely was created sometime in the 1970s, when Kiryas Joel was founded. By the mid-2000s, 16 different private companies operated in Orange County, and none had any connections with each other.As a solution, Transit Orange was created in 2006 to consolidate and unify the operations of the multiple different companies that ran services in Orange County at the time. Transit Orange did not directly take over or replace any transit systems, however local and dial-a-bus services began using county-owned and Transit Orange-branded vehicles. In 2022, services overseen by the county had a total ridership of 812,366 passengers per year.\n\n\n== Services ==\nTransit Orange does not directly operate any routes; all operations are contracted out. When the operator is known, it is listed.\n\n\n=== Municipal local services ===\nAll municipal services are operated as their own private companies, but their fleets mostly or entirely consist of leased buses owned by Transit Orange, and all services operate under the Transit Orange brand name.\n\n\n==== Middletown ====\nThe Middletown system, officially known as the Middletown Transit Corporation, is operated by Short Line Bus. Four routes operate from a central hub on Railroad Avenue, located in Downtown Middletown. The system has existed since 1935.\nAll routes operate as loops, serving different parts of Middletown and the surrounding towns:\nRoute 1 serves Highland Avenue, the Tall Oaks Apartments, and Fei Tian College.\nRoute 2 serves the David Moore Heights housing development, the Middletown ShopRite, the Middlecrest Crossing Apartments, and Orange County Community College's Middletown campus.\nRoute 3 serves the Orange Plaza Mall, the Galleria Mall, Crystal Run, and the Orange Regional Medical Center. This route also connects with the Middletown–Town of Wallkill Metro-North station.\nRoute 4 serves Wallkill Senior Housing, the Wallkill Shoprite, the Wallkill Plaza Mall, and the Wallkill Town Center Mall.\n\n\n==== Newburgh ====\nThe Newburgh system, officially known as the Newburgh-Beacon Bus Corporation, but commonly known as Newburgh Area Transit, operates four routes that converge on downtown Newburgh. The system has existed since 1934. The company is owned by Leprechaun Lines, which in addition to the local services, operates two other services: the Beacon-Newburgh-Stewart Shuttle from Beacon, New York to Stewart International Airport via Newburgh, and a commuter bus from Poughkeepsie to White Plains. These bus routes are not affiliated with Transit Orange, and use Leprechaun Lines-branded buses. However, connections can be made to the Beacon-Newburgh-Stewart Shuttle from local Newburgh routes.\nThe Newburgh system operates four routes:\n\n\n==== Kiryas Joel ====\nThe Kiryas Joel system, officially and commonly known as Kiryas Joel Area Transit, serves the heavily-Hasidic Jewish village of Kiryas Joel. The service is operated by the village itself, using mostly buses owned by Transit Orange, although the village does own some of its own buses. This system gets the most ridership of any of the systems by far – 561,346 riders in 2022 – and comprises a majority of the total ridership of Transit Orange. Kiryas Joel is also served by Monsey Trails and Monroe Bus Lines, which while also catering to the Hasidic community, are not affiliated with Kiryas Joel Area Transit or Transit Orange. In keeping with Shabbat, services do not run on Friday afternoons or Saturdays. \nThe Kiryas Joel system operates three routes:\n\n\n==== Warwick ====\nThe Warwick system, which is municipally operated and part of the same agency as the Warwick Dial-a-Bus, operates a local bus route in the Village of Warwick and shuttle services to Monroe, Goshen, and Wallkill. The Warwick system uses solely minibuses, and vehicles are shuffled between dial-a-ride and fixed-route services.In total, the town operates three fixed routes:\n\n\n=== The Main Line ===\nThe Main Line service operates between Middletown and Woodbury Commons. On weekends, it is extended to the Harriman Metro-North station. It is operated by Short Line Bus. Unlike all other services, the buses on the Main Line are not owned by Transit Orange, but rather by Short Line Bus.\n\n\n=== Dial-a-Bus ===\nDial-a-Bus services are operated by the following towns:\nGoshen and Chester (combined service)\nHighlands\nKiryas Joel/Palm Tree\nMonroe\nMontgomery and Crawford (combined service)\nNewburgh\nPort Jervis and Deerpark (combined service)\n\n\n== Fleet ==\nThe municipal local services mostly use a fleet of 29- and 35-foot Gillig Low Floor hybrid-electric buses, which were constructed in 2013. In addition to these buses, Kiryas Joel operates three Vicinity buses that are owned by the village itself (as opposed to Transit Orange, like the rest of the fleet). Also in addition to the 2013 Gilligs, Newburgh uses two 2022-built diesel-powered Gilligs, which are owned by Transit Orange. As opposed to the other systems, Warwick uses exclusively minibuses on their local routes, and has a shared fleet with their dial-a-bus system.The Main Line bus uses Short Line-owned buses, usually Gillig Low Floors or Phantoms. These are separate from the Transit Orange-owned Gilligs.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nSystem map PDF\nLocal Bus page\nDial-a-Bus page\nA story from the Times Herald-Record outlining issues with Transit Orange",

        "content": "The following is a list of NHK broadcasting stations established by corporation in various parts of Japan. This is a list of broadcasting stations. There are 54 in total, including the Metropolitan Area Station, which has jurisdiction over Tokyo, as a broadcasting station in its own right.\n\n\n== Details ==\nBroadcasting stations in bold are the bases of each region. All stations other than Kanto-Koshinetsu were renamed \"base broadcasting stations\" due to the organizational reform on June 14, 2019. Regarding Kanto-Koshinetsu, the Metropolitan Area Station, which plays the role of a base broadcasting station, it was established in the organizational reform on August 3, 2020. Furthermore, on April 1, 2022, the names of the seven broadcasting stations will be changed back to \"broadcasting stations.\" NHK states that the positioning and roles of these broadcasting stations will not change after that date.[4]\n(City/ward name): Location of the city or ward where the broadcasting station is located. If there are multiple broadcasting stations within the same prefecture, the area under their jurisdiction is indicated separately.\nWhen the organization was revised in 2015, the news office and communication department were abolished and integrated into the branch. This section also describes the branches that were created in 1988 after being demoted from broadcasting stations.\n\n(City/ward name): Location of the city or ward where the broadcasting station is located. If there are multiple broadcasting stations within the same prefecture, the area under their jurisdiction is indicated separately.\nWhen the organization was revised in 2015, the news office and communication department were abolished and integrated into the branch. This section also describes the branches that were created in 1988 after being demoted from broadcasting stations.\n\n\n== Hokkaido ==\nBecause Hokkaido is in a unique of \"one road, one block\" (1道1ブロック) environment, it has undergone unique reforms that differ from other regions.\nIn 2015, license fee sales in Hokkaido were integrated into the Sapporo station sales promotion department, and as a subordinate organization, sales were conducted at each station in Hakodate (south Hokkaido), Asahikawa (north Hokkaido), Obihiro (east Hokkaido), and Sapporo city (central Hokkaido). A center was established to carry out sales-related duties by dividing Hokkaido into four areas, regardless of the area of the broadcasting station.\nHowever, with the arrival of Reiwa, the \"department system\" of each broadcasting station was changed to a \"center system\", and it was further reviewed, and finally, as of April 1, 2023.\nBroadcasting stations in Hokkaido will be subject to a \"three-tier system\" different from those in other areas (all stations will be under the control of the Sapporo station, but the three later stations will also be controlled by the first station).\nThe Sapporo station is organized into two centers: the \"Business Management Center\" and the \"Media Center,\" and all departments other than the administrative departments at each station are consolidated into the \"Media Center.\" As a result, the \"sales center\" will be abolished and transferred to the attached station, and the state will become \"each station in the prefecture = media center\".\nThe three later stations have transferred the duties of \"programming\", \"announcements\", and \"receipt fee sales\" to the earlier stations, but will continue to carry out other duties and will work in cooperation with the earlier stations.\n\n\n== Tohoku ==\nThe base station, Sendai, has a three-center system: the \"Business Management Center\", the \"Content Center\", and the \"Viewer Relations Center\". In addition, local stations other than the Sendai station have two centers: the \"Business Management Planning Center\" and the \"Contents Center\".\n\n\n== Kanto-Koshinetsu ==\nKanto and Koshinetsu had been managed by multiple departments at the headquarters for many years, but when the \"two-tier system\" of broadcasting stations was reinstated in Reiwa, the old \"Metropolitan Area Broadcasting Center\" was separated from the Broadcasting General Branch → Media General Branch, and became the base broadcasting station for the Kanto and Koshinetsu regions as the Metropolitan Area Station.\nInitially, there was only a wide-area management department and a news/program production department, but later the wide-area reception fee sales department was also transferred.\nThe base stations in the metropolitan area have a three-center system: the \"Business Management Center,\" the \"Content Center,\" and the \"Viewer Relations Center.\" In addition, local stations, excluding metropolitan area stations, have a two-center system: the Business Management Planning Center and the Contents Center. However, the situation for metropolitan area stations is slightly different from other base stations, with the Business Management Center only managing broadcasting stations in the metropolitan area, the Viewer Relations Center only managing viewer duties related to license fees, and the ``Content Management Center only managing broadcast stations in the metropolitan area. \"Center\" does not include transmitting/receiving technical operations or announcement rooms. Excluded areas will be handled at the headquarters level as before.\n\n\n== Chubu ==\nThe base station, Nagoya, has a three-center system: the \"Business Management Center,\" the \"Content Center,\" and the \"Viewer Relations Center.\" In addition, local stations other than the Nagoya station have a two-center system: the Business Management Planning Center and the ``Contents Center.。\n\n\n== Kinki ==\nThe Osaka station, which is the base station, has a three-center system: \"Business Management Center,\" \"Content Center,\" and \"Viewer Relations Center.\" Because the Osaka Station is positioned as a backup for the headquarters, some departments are Leave the system behind. In addition, local stations other than the Osaka station have two centers: the Business Management Planning Center and the ``Contents Center.\n\n\n== Chugoku ==\nThe base station, Hiroshima, has a three-center system: the \"Business Management Center,\" the \"Content Center,\" and the \"Viewer Relations Center.\" In addition, local stations, excluding the Hiroshima station, have a two-center system: the \"Business Management Planning Center\" and the \"Contents Center\".。\n\n\n== Shikoku ==\nDue to Shikoku's small size, the structure of the Matsuyama station, which is the base station, is different from other base stations, and has a two-center system, the \"Business Management Planning Center\" and the \"Contents Center\", which is similar to that of local stations.\n\n\n== Kyushu ==\nThe base station, Fukuoka station, has a three-center system: \"Business Management Center\", \"Content Center\", and \"Viewer Relations Center\". In addition, local stations, excluding the Fukuoka station, have a two-center system: the \"Business Management Planning Center\" and the \"Contents Center.\"。\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Wang Jianxi (Chinese: 汪建熙, August 1951 - 1 December 2023), also known in English as Jesse Wang, was a Chinese official who held senior financial sector positions for more than two decades between 1992 and 2013. He was a leading participant in the creation of an accounting and auditing framework in the heyday of Chinese economic reform.\n\n\n== Life ==\nBorn in Jiangsu, Wang Jianxi graduated from high school in Beijing in 1967 and worked at the Yingchun Machinery Factory in Hulin, Heilongjiang until 1978 during the Cultural Revolution. Following the revival of university education, he then entered Renmin University of China where he was assigned to a major in financial accounting. In 1982, he undertook graduate studies at the Chinese Academy of Fiscal Sciences, for which he spent most of 1983 in Sydney, interning at accounting firm Touche Ross and simultaneously studying at the University of Sydney in the part-time MBA program.\nWang then was the first-ever student to enroll for a PhD in accounting in Communist China, in 1985 at the Academy of Fiscal Sciences under the supervision of Yang Jiwan, and completed it in early 1990 after obtaining China's first-ever CPA certificate (No. 001) in 1987 and working at the China Financial Accounting Consulting Company (Chinese: 中华会计师事务) in the meantime.\nIn March 1989, while still working on his PhD thesis, Wang started working part-time for the Stock Exchange Executive Council, which had just been created in Beijing to foster stock market development in China. As such, he was a key participant in drafting China's first securities Law and in the work that led to formal status being granted to the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange in late 1990.\nIn September 1991, Wang moved to the United States to learn about the functioning of the National Association of Securities Dealers. He was recalled to China in October 1992 to become the first Chief Accountant of the newly established China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), and from April 1993 also led the CSRC's international department. He was instrumental in the conclusion on 28 April 1994 of a memorandum of understanding between the CSRC and the US Securities and Exchange Commission that paved the ground for the first listings of mainland Chinese companies on US stock markets, starting with Shandong Huaneng Power Development in August 1994.\nIn 1996, Wang moved to the UK affiliate of Bank of China, then in 2000 went back to the CSRC as Deputy Secretary General until 2002, then Assistant Chairman. He was a Commissioner of the United Nations Compensation Commission from 1999 to 2004. In 2000-2001, together with CSRC Chairman Zhou Xiaochuan, he advocated China's adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, but could not overcome the reticence of the Ministry of Finance and its Assistant Minister Feng Shuping, in charge of accounting matters at the time.\nIn 2004, Wang became Vice Chairman of Central Huijin Investment, then in 2007, Deputy General Manager of China Investment Corporation (CIC) which took over Huijin from the People's Bank of China. In the mid-2000s he also served as chairman of China International Capital Corporation (CICC), until being replaced by Li Jiange in early 2008. From 2008 to 2013, he was also a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.\nWang Jianxi retired from CIC in March 2013. He subsequently engaged in non-profit activities as board member of the Boyuan Foundation, then as chairman of the Beijing Dalio Public Welfare Foundation, established in 2014 at the initiative of American financier Ray Dalio. He died of illness in Beijing.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLiu Hongru\nXie Ping\n\n\n== Notes ==",

        "content": "Agri-environmental measures (MAE) are measures introduced in the European Union as part of the Common Agricultural Policy, in return for payments to voluntary farmers. They are one response to the growing concerns of the public, consumers, local authorities and certain elected representatives about the ecological impact of the intensification of agriculture, which developed strongly throughout the 20th century, relying on crop mechanization, chemical inputs, off-farm breeding and, more recently, biotechnologies integrating the transfer of genes from one species to another (transgenesis).\n\n\n== Objectives ==\nThese measures are mainly aimed at protecting rural landscapes, watercourses, flora, and fauna.\nThese credits are generally for maintenance (management), not investment ( they finance hedge management, not hedge planting). They are governed by the European \"agri-environmental\" regulation of June 30, 1992, which resulted from the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in May 1992. Each member state has developed its subsidiary version.In France, the 2007-2013 programming period classifies MAEs into nine schemes:\n\nthe Prime Herbagère Agroenvironnementale or PHAE\nthe rotational MAE\naid for input-saving polyculture-breeding forage systems (SFEI)\naid for conversion to organic farming (CAB)\nsupport for maintaining organic farming (MAB)\nprotection of endangered breeds (PRM)\nPreservation of endangered plant resources (PRV)\naid for beekeeping\nMAE territorialized (MAET)In the case of MAET, only certain types of measures are eligible, and only on certain territories; for example, in Natura 2000 areas, in regional nature parks, in areas vulnerable to erosion, etc. (they are said to be territorialized). These measures can be financed by the State via the DIREN, or by the Water Agencies (protection of water catchment areas, etc.), but also by local authorities (regional councils, general councils, etc.).

This is also true of France, where we are witnessing a trivialization of flora and fauna, with a sharp reduction in biodiversity. These measures have slowed the phenomenon, but not stopped it.\nQualitative and financial assessments are difficult to establish for several reasons:\n\nsystems that compensate farmers financially for the loss of income associated with measures deemed beneficial to the environment or biodiversity vary from country to country and from period to period; thus, in some cases, the main objectives are a sharp reduction in emissions of chemical or non-chemical inputs (chemical fertilizers or nutrients brought in excess in other forms); pesticides. These objectives do not seem to have been achieved in 2013 in France, for example, where nitrates and pesticides continue to pose serious eutrophication and ecotoxicological problems.) Other objectives include protecting biodiversity and its habitats, through renaturation (restoration of ponds, hedges, reintroduction of species, etc.), rural landscapes, and preventing rural exodus;\na geographical area may be affected by pesticide inputs (mainly airborne or runoff) or by turbidity phenomena induced by agriculture outside the area concerned, or upstream of the watershed;\nprogram content, requirements, and indicators vary from country to country and region to region, and not all European countries benefit from agri-environmental programs (only 26 out of 44 European countries had such a program at the beginning of the 2000s; however, some of the countries not benefiting from such programs had more extensive agriculture, and a priori less destructive of biodiversity);\nlogically, areas of extensive agriculture (where biodiversity is still relatively present) were more targeted by these programs, while areas of intensive agriculture (where biodiversity had already been greatly reduced, continued to deteriorate).\n\n\n=== In the United States; a tradition going back more than 70 years ===\nIn the United States, agricultural subsidies (and even crop insurance) are much more subject to cross-compliance than in Europe. This environmental conditionality has been an integral part of American agricultural policy since the 1930s, following the observation of severe soil degradation caused by the intensification of agriculture.In 1985, the United States introduced three separate cross-compliance programs for field crops (corn, wheat, barley, sorghum, oats, rice, cotton, and soybeans, which receive aid via commodity programs). These three programs were set up under the 1985 Farm Bill. They are overseen by the Farm Service Agency (FSA) and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).\n\nconservation compliance\", aimed primarily at combating soil erosion and degradation (with 41 million hectares eligible);\nsodbuster\", designed to protect vulnerable soils from plowing and cultivation;\nthe \"swam-buster\", targeting wetlands (6 million hectares)In 2013, \"about 80% of U.S. farmers use crop insurance as an essential risk management tool to manage price volatility and climate variability; Farmers and ranchers pay a premium for this insurance, but about 60 percent of the actual cost of this premium is covered by taxpayers via USDA subsidies\". Thus, the public may legitimately want crop insurance payments to be conditional on environmentally sound agricultural performance, argues Bruce Knight, Director of Strategic Conservation Solutions and former Secretary of Marketing and Regulatory Programs at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) from 2006 to 2009, after having headed the Natural Resources Conservation Service (from 2002 to 2006).\n\n\n=== In Europe: mixed results ===\nIn Europe, eco-conditionality has been enshrined in the horizontal regulations of the \"Berlin Agreement\" since 19999. However, for reasons of subsidiarity, it is the member states of the European Union who define the precise content of the programs, and who must ensure, through appropriate controls, that they are properly applied on their territory.\nIn 2003, a study estimated that around 24.3 billion euros had been spent on agri-environmental programs in the European Union (EU) between 1994 and 2002, but it was not possible to assess how much of this was spent on biodiversity; an exhaustive search of studies that had sought to test the effectiveness of agri-environmental programs in the press showed that only 62 evaluation studies had been published, carried out in just 5 EU countries and Switzerland; 76% of the studies were carried out in the Netherlands and the UK, where at that time only 6% of the EU's agri-environmental budgets had been spent. A few studies concerned Germany Ireland and Portugal; and 31% of these studies contained no statistical analysis. What's more, when an experimental approach was used, its conclusions were generally weak and biased towards the most favorable indicators. The most common experimental design (used by 37% of studies) was to compare biodiversity in agri-environmental scheme areas and areas presented as control areas, but with biases, for example when farmers or coordinating authorities selected the agri-environmental scheme sites studied. In such cases, the sites were likely to have higher biodiversity at the outset than the control sites; this problem can be solved by collecting a wider range of baseline data (34% of studies), comparing trends and not just inventories or inventories (32%) or studying changes (26% of cases) in biodiversity depending on whether or not the area benefits from agri-environmental measures, or better (done in only 16% of studies) by matching control sites and those that have benefited from agri-environmental measures so that their environmental conditions are similar.\nonly just over half (54%) of the indicator species or groups studied showed an increase. And 6% of these indicators showed a decrease in species richness (fewer species) or abundance compared to the control sites.\nAt 17% of sites, some species seemed to benefit from the measures, while 23% showed no change at all, with a highly variable response depending on the taxa observed.\nOf 19 studies that examined bird response and included statistical analysis, only 4 concluded that there was a significant increase in bird richness or abundance. Two studies even showed a decrease, while 9 others showed both increases and decreases.\nAbout arthropods, comparisons with control sites were made by 20 studies; only 11 studies showed an increase in species richness or abundance, but none showed a decrease, and three showed both increases and decreases depending on the taxon.\nConcerning effects on plant biodiversity: 14 studies were carried out, of which less than half (six) showed an increase in species richness or flora abundance. Two showed decreases, and no study showed a combination of increases and decreases. the review of the literature published in 2003 for Europe concluded that none of the evaluation studies published up to that point could be considered robust or allow a general judgment to be made on the effectiveness of European agri-environmental programs. The authors called for a process of ecological effects assessment to be incorporated as an integral part of any agri-environmental scheme, including systematic collection of baseline data, more random positioning of control sites, but in areas benefiting from the measures, and ensuring that they are scientifically comparable (which implies similar initial conditions) with sufficient replication of measures and controls. They also feel that the results of these studies should be more widely collected and disseminated, to better identify and disseminate best practices in biodiversity enhancement and protection, and to spend the subsidies and grants earmarked for these measures more efficiently.In 2019, an econometric study carried out in Lorraine also attempted to measure the impact of this policy on land use, which conditions the production of ecosystem services, from 1988 to 2015, based on data collected from the Fadn and Annual Agricultural Statistics (Dussine, 2019). It appears that direct subsidies paid to encourage certain activities have a relatively limited impact on land use, while agri-environmental measures could explain the development of certain surfaces such as protein crops which, when coupled with oilseeds (such as the rapeseed/beans combination), make it possible to limit insecticide treatments. Similarly, compensatory allowances paid for natural handicaps (Ichn) seem to have a very positive impact on grassland, wasteland, and deciduous trees and even seem to be able to slow down the artificialization of land, but the amounts involved are small and many farmers consider them insufficient.\n\n\n=== Under the new CAP ===\nA few new features have appeared locally and briefly, including the possibility (in 2010 only) of MAE Rotationnelle (MAER), a 5-year contract for farms producing 60% or more of cereals and oilseeds in the 2010 UAA. In return, they must diversify their annual crop rotation and introduce a crop succession (on the plots involved) that better preserves or restores biodiversity, while limiting inputs.From 2003 onwards, the new CAP must theoretically accompany its subsidies with clearer environmental requirements and result indicators. Second pillar aids\" are \"voluntary contractual aids, in the form of the Indemnité Compensatoire des Handicaps Naturels (ICHN), or return for compliance with environmental specifications over five years (Mesures Agroenvironnementales, including the Prime Herbagère Agroenvironnementale and the MAE Rotationnelle...) \"; new MAEs are theoretically limited to MAE Territorialisées (in Natura 2000 zones, and especially catchment areas). A new aid reform is scheduled for 2014 (in particular to accompany the end of milk quotas scheduled for 2015). Farmers must declare on the RPG (Registre parcellaire graphique) the outline of the \"parcelles culturales\" that are the subject of a commitment (MAE, PHAE, Bio, etc.), and enter the code of each crop, committed or not, present within the PAC islet, which should also help improve environmental assessment statistics. GAECs are subject to a special procedure concerning the \"maximum surface area that can be committed to a new MAE contract (PHAE2, MAE Rotationnelle), with a limit of 3 farms within the GAEC \".\n\n\n== See also ==\nRevegetation\nEcological engineering\nSustainable agriculture\nNatura 2000\nAgroforestry\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\"Des projets agro-environnementaux innovants, intégrés et collectifs : quelques enseignements tirés de l'analyse d'expériences de terrainCentre d'études et de prospective du ministère de l'Agriculture, de l'Agroalimentaire et de la Forêt\".

        "content": "I Hate Sex was a Canadian screamo band from Edmonton, Alberta. The band formed in December 2014 and broke up in 2018. During the three years the band was together, they released one full length album, one solo EP and three split EPs. \n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was formed by Nicole Boychuk and Ashton Burns after meeting in university the year prior. The two realized they had the same goal of starting a band, so Boychuk reached out to social media to create a whole band. This is how Jibirl, who Boychuk slightly knew, and Curtis Burton, who was a total stranger, joined the band and I Hate Sex was officially formed. The bands first ever practice was on December 6, 2014 but the band almost always says that they formed in early 2015. During the initial practice, they wrote one by Metallica, and January 24th, two of the tracks that would end up on their debut EP Circle Thinking a few months later.A few months after Circle Thinking was released, on December 10th, I Hate Sex released a split EP with another Edmonton band, Low Level. The EP contains a total of 7 tracks, with I Hate Sex on side B contributing three of the tracks. Only 60 copies of the EP were made, all being on red cassette tape. Pre-orders came with a trading card, a hand-written note of appreciation, and a picture of a Canadian landscape.In 2018, I Hate Sex broke up. They have never stated why they chose to break up. Despite the band dissolving many years ago, as of 2024, Boychuk is still active on the I Hate Sex Twitter page, often interacting with fan art, and occasionally sharing information about lyrics, memes, and other I Hate Sex related posts.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Final line-up ===\nNicole Boychuk – vocals (2015-2018)\nWill Gregson – guitar (2018)\nMatt Wayne – bass (2016-2018)\nShoji Blunderfield – bass (2018 live only)\nByron Mayer – drums (2015-2018)\n\n\n=== Past members ===\nJibril Y– bass (2015–2016)\nAshton Burns – guitar (2015-2017)\nCurtis Burton – drums (2015)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nWorld of Grief (Dog Knights Productions and Day Crush Records, April 20, 2017)\n\n\n=== Singles & EPs ===\nCircle Thinking (Too Far Gone Records, July 31, 2015)\nSplit with Low Level (Self-Released, December 10, 2015)\nSplit with Algae Bloom and Black Knight Satellite (Never Better Records,  August 2, 2016)\nSplit with thisismenotthinkingofyou, Yotsuya Kaidan, Ghostlate and Healing Powers (Rubaiyat Records, February 28, 2017)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Chuck Barnes Jr. (born June 1, 1982) is an American professional stock car racing driver who has previously competed in the ARCA Re/Max Series.\n\n\n== Racing career ==\nBarnes Jr. first began his racing career at the age of eleven, racing go-karts, where he went on to win several championships through the 1997 season. In 1997, he raced his ever first stock car race at Salem Speedway, finishing in seventh. He then competed in his first full season of stock car racing in 1998, finishing in the top-twenty in points at Louisville Motor Speedway in the NASCAR Sportsman Division and was the rookie of the year in the Street Stock division. In 2000, Barnes Jr. won the Salem Speedway Street Stock Championship with three feature wins, making him the youngest driver in the history of Salem Speedway to win a championship at the age of eighteen.\nIn 2001, Barnes Jr. made his first start in the ASA CRA Super Series, and went on to win the series championship in 2004, winning two races at Shady Bowl Speedway and Nashville Fairgrounds Speedway. Late in the following year, Barnes Jr. would participate in the Race for the Ride at North Wilkesboro Speedway.\nIn 2006, Barnes Jr. made his debut in the ARCA Re/Max Series at Toledo Speedway, driving the No. 35 Chevrolet for TC Motorsports. After starting in sixth, Barnes Jr. went on to win the race, holding off multi-time series champion Frank Kimmel. Barnes Jr. had previously tested for Kimmel's team earlier in the year at Salem. He then attempted two more ARCA races that year, finishing fourth at Salem and failing to qualify for the inaugural race at Iowa Speedway. It was also during this year that he attempted to make his debut in the NASCAR Busch Series at Memphis International Raceway, driving the No. 07 Chevrolet for TC Motorsports, where he ultimately failed to qualify. He then attempted one more ARCA race in 2007, finishing one lap down in eighth at Salem.\nAfter his NASCAR and ARCA career ended, Barnes Jr. has since competed in series such as the ASA Southern Super Series, the CRA JEGS All-Stars Tour, and the CRA Street Stock Series.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBarnes Jr. is the son of fellow racing driver Chuck Barnes Sr., who has competed in series such as the ASA CRA Super Series, the ALL PRO Super Series, the Frank Kimmel Street Stock Nationals, and the CRA Street Stock Series.

        "content": "Meridian Brothers is an experimental band led by classically trained Colombian musician Eblis Álvarez, who founded it as a solo project in Bogotá in 1998. The group mix electronic and avant-garde music with traditional Colombian music styles, particularly cumbia, vallenato, and salsa.\n\n\n== History ==\nMeridian Brothers was founded by Eblis Álvarez as a solo project in 1998, and he sold early recordings on cassette in Bogotá.\nWhile playing in short-lived group Ensamble Polifónico Vallenato, Álvarez began to use the Meridian Brothers project to experiment with traditional Colombian musical styles. Álvarez has said that \"the first Meridian Brothers albums suck\", and that the project found its feet with its first official release, Meridian Brothers V: El Advenimiento Del Castillo Mujer.\nIn 2007 the project became a band, with Álvarez being joined by four of his friends from Javeriana University: María Valencia (clarinet, saxophone and synthesizers), Damián Ponce (percussion, replaced in 2016 by Mauricio Ramírez), Alejandro Forero (keyboards), and César Quevedo (bass). The group released two more albums on Colombian record label La Distritofónica: Meridian Brothers VI in 2009, and Meridian Brothers VII in 2011, which was partially composed by a computer algorithm.: 1  In 2011 the Meridian Brothers played at Worldtronics festival in Berlin.\nIn 2012 Meridian Brothers released their fourth studio album Desesperanza on UK label Soundway Records. \nAlso in 2012 DJ Gilles Peterson included the track Guarancha UFO on his list of the best tracks played on his BBC show that year.\nIn 2013 German record label Staubgold released Devoción, a compilation of tracks from Meridian Brothers' first three albums,\nand the group played Festival Estéreo Picnic, Roskilde Festival, and Rencontres Trans Musicales. \nIn 2014 Meridian Brothers released the album Salvadora Robot on Soundway Records, and played Villette Sonique, Paléo Festival, and Rock al Parque. Their next two albums, Los Suicidas in 2015 and ¿Dónde Estás María? in 2017, were also released on Soundway.\nIn 2020 Meridian Brothers released Cumbia Siglo XXI on Bongo Joe Records. Describing the album, Álvarez said \"when I went to study composition I discovered algorithmic synthesis, a way to program synthetic generated sounds within an algorithm... but I didn’t do anything with that because I didn’t know how to take that and put it into Colombian culture. It wasn’t loud enough, or punchy enough, but eventually I managed to do it, and it was Cumbia Siglo XXI.\" In 2021 they released joint album Paz en La Tierra with fellow Bogotá band Conjunto Media Luna, also on Bongo Joe.\nIn 2022 the group released Meridian Brothers & El Grupo Renacimiento, a joint album with an imaginary salsa band. In 2023 they played Big Ears Festival in Tennessee.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nMeridian Brothers V: El Advenimiento del Castillo mujer (2005, La Distritofónica/Discrepant)\nMeridian Brothers VI: Este es el Corcel Heroico que nos Salvará de la Hambruna y Corrupción (2009, La Distritofónica)\nMeridian Brothers VII (2011, La Distritofónica)\nDesesperanza (2012, Soundway)\nDevoción (Works 2005 - 2011) (2013, Staubgold)\nSalvadora Robot (2014, Soundway)\nLos Suicidas (2015, Soundway)\n¿Dónde Estás María?

By the mid-20th century, the council had established its offices and chambers in Stafford Road, which it retained as its base until local government re-organisation in 1974. In the 1960s, civic leaders decided that the area needed a public events venue. The site they selected had been occupied by the Great Western Nail Works operated by John Maddock & Co.The new building was designed by Maurice Day in the modern style, built by Pat Smith & Sons (Oakengates) Limited in concrete, brick and glass and was officially opened by the jockey, Sir Gordon Richards, as \"Oakengates Town Hall\" on 25 May 1968. The design of the two-storey building involved a long main frontage facing southeast onto Limes Walk with a canted main entrance at the south corner of the building. There was a large canopy projected out over the pavement along the southwest and southeast frontages.The building became a popular venue for concerts: the rock band, Fleetwood Mac, performed there in May 1969 and the rock and roll band, Showaddywaddy, made the first of several visits in February 1983. As one of the few large events venues in the area, it also became a preferred location for meetings of Telford and Wrekin Council.A large auditorium was added, with work starting in 1983, and, following further re-modelling, it reopened as \"Oakengates Theatre\" in 1989. After completion of a further programme of refurbishment works, the building was re-opened by the comedian, Julian Clary, as \"The Place\" in 2005. The branding was refreshed again and it was renamed \"Telford Theatre\" in 2022. In 2024, it closed for alterations, to enlarge the main auditorium to seat 750 people, and create a new studio theatre, bar and dining area.\n\n\n== References ==",

The first of the des Escotais, Thibault, participated in the Third Crusade in 1191 alongside Richard the Lionheart, and Louis's lineage is proven up to Guillaume II des Escotais who lived in 1280.His father, Roland des Escotais, a lieutenant general in the king's armies, was granted the erection of his lands into the county of Escotais by royal letters patent from King Louis XV in 1755.\n\n\n=== His life ===\nLouis-Jacques-Roland des Escotais was born on November 2, 1746, in the family château of La Roche des Escotais, one of the Loire Valley châteaux. He was the second child and principal heir among three siblings.\nHis father, Roland des Escotais, led a distinguished life at the court of King Louis XV in Versailles, earning him the Honneurs de la Cour on April 20, 1767. This was one of the most prestigious noble distinctions reserved for the oldest noble families distinguished on the battlefield.\nOn June 26, 1771, at the age of 24, he married Marie-Louise de Plas, a lady-in-waiting to Sophie of France and then to Adélaïde of France. King Louis XV and the entire royal family honored him by signing his marriage contract.\nFollowing the Revolution, he left France in September 1791 with his eldest son. He then took command of one of the divisions of the Armée des Princes, notably during the Siege of Maastricht in 1793.\nHe later moved to London with his eldest son, where he remained for nearly twenty years, passing away there on November 9, 1812, at the age of 66. He was buried in the cemetery of St Pancras Old Church.\n\n\n== Military career ==\nLouis des Escotais began his training at a young age, as was customary for aristocratic sons. In 1760, at the age of 14, he joined the king's first company of musketeers. He continued his training under his uncle, Louis-Joseph des Escotais (Field Marshal of the Chantilly regiment), serving as his aide-de-camp. At just 15, he participated in the Seven Years' War. His bravery was particularly noted during the Battle of Friedberg (August 28–30, 1762), where he was wounded in the arm and his horse was killed under him.In 1765, at the age of 19, he completed his training and took command of a company in the Esterhazy regiment, and four years later, he was promoted to Mestre de Camps.His military and diplomatic abilities were noted, and he was appointed as an embassy advisor to the States General of the Provinces of the Union (now the Netherlands) on November 12, 1772. There, he conducted several intelligence activities on behalf of Louis XV.He then returned to France and on April 18, 1776, received command of the Boulonnois regiment from Louis XVI, and was promoted to colonel, then to Brigadier in 1781.His loyalty and bravery earned him the honor of being decorated in 1777 with the Royal and Military Order of Saint Louis, a distinction rewarding the most valiant officers.He ended his career in the French army of the old regime at the rank of field marshal, which he obtained on March 9, 1788.\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== Archives ==\nActs of Catholicity, Series: 6NUM6/231/017.

        "content": "Shannon Launch and Recovery System (SLARS) is a custom designed tractor and trailer specifically designed for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) to launch and recover Shannon-class lifeboats.The SLARS is produced by two British companies, Supacat, based in Honiton, Devon, and Clayton Engineering Limited, based in Knighton, Powys. In 2015, Supacat rebranded as SC Innovation.\n\n\n== Operation ==\nThe Shannon launch and recovery system (SLARS) was developed to launch and recover the 18-tonne Shannon-class RNLI lifeboat.\nBarmouth lifeboat 13-30 Ella Larsen\nThe lifeboat is launched, and recovered, bow-first. The carriage, mounted on tracked wheels, is used to transport a lifeboat from boathouse to sea. The carriage can then be tilted, effectively acting as a slipway to launch the boat when released.On return, the boat will be driven ashore. A synthetic winch line, designed not to recoil should it break, is attached to the bow of the lifeboat, and the carriage is again tilted to meet the bow of the boat. The lifeboat is then hauled up the carriage. When the carriage is returned to the horizontal, and the lifeboat securely attached, the top section of the carriage rotates 180° as a turntable, and the lifeboat is ready to relaunch.Both the tractor and carriage are tracked vehicles. In some locations, the carriage is also a powered unit, to assist traction and movement. The driver has two sets of controls, and can rotate the seat 180°. The high cab gives excellent visibility, with CCTV to assist. The cab is fully waterproof, and the vehicle can be operated in 2.4m of calm water.\n\n\n== RNLI SLARS Fleet ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nShannon-class lifeboat\nTalus MB-H amphibious tractor\nTalus MB-764 amphibious tractor\nRNLI New Holland TC45 launch tractor\nTalus Atlantic 85 DO-DO launch carriage\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On April 12, 2024, a man crashed a stolen semi-trailer truck into a Texas Department of Public Safety office in Brenham, Texas, killing one person and injuring thirteen others. The suspect was arrested at the scene and named as 42-year-old Clenard Parker.\n\n\n== Attack ==\nOn the morning of April 12, 2024, Parker allegedly stole a semi-trailer truck from a gas station in Chappell Hill and drove to Benham, where he was pursued by deputies from the Washington County Sheriff's Office. At around 10:41 a.m., Parker allegedly took a sharp right turn into a Texas Department of Public Safety office and rammed the truck through its front entrance, resulting in one person's death and the injuring of thirteen others. The truck then reversed from the crash site and appeared to be preparing to strike it again, however authorities at the scene were able to detain the driver. Brenham Mayor Atwood Kenjura commented that, according to the fire chief, \"if he had veered a little bit to the left the second time, there would have been a collapse of that building.\"\n\n\n== Suspect ==\nThe suspect was identified as 42-year-old Clenard Parker, from Chappell Hill, Texas. Investigators discovered that Parker had visited the office the day before the attack, where he attempted to get his commercial driver's licence renewed, but was denied. According to a relative, Parker used to drive semi-trailer trucks. The relative further stated that Parker suffered delusions following a \"traumatizing\" car accident several years prior to the attack, recalling an incident where Parker believed former U.S. President Donald Trump had once visited his home, when Trump had, in fact, not. Another relative said Parker was living alone in a trailer at the time of the attack, and also stated that Parker suffered from mental illness. Parker has a criminal history of non-violent offences dating back to 1999, including criminal trespass, arson and a felony prohibited weapons charge.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Siege of Dansborg (Danish; Belejringen af Dansborg) alternatively the Siege of Fort Dansborg (Danish; Belejringen af Fort Dansborg) sometimes also referred to as Willem Leyel's siege of Dansborg (Danish; William Leyels belejring af Dansborg), was a siege initiated by traveler and seafarer, Willem (Danish; William) Leyel, against the men loyal to governor Bernt Pessart. The siege was concluded after the men at Dansborg opened the gates for Willem Leyel, surrendered and accepted Leyel as the new governor.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nIn 1620, on a voyage from Denmark to India, Ove Gjedde established Danish India at Tranquebar. His successor, Dutchman Ronald Crappé went further and established a far-flung string a Danish factories in Asia. These foundations were, though, not maintained by his successor, Bernt Pessart (admin. 1636-1643) who ecumbered large debts from the start of his administration. Because of the economic failures, the largest investor in the company, king Christian IV of Denmark, sought to reestablish the economic success and therefore sent out experienced seafarer, Willem Leyel, to Tranquebar. \n\n\n=== Arrival of Leyel ===\nLeyel went ashore at Tranquebar on 22 June 1644, with 70 armed men, both \"blacks and \"whites\", and two smaller guns. Concurrently, governor Bernt pessart had left for Japan, and left the fort in control of Jakob von Stackenborg. Stackenborg sealed off Dansborg for Leyel, and subsequently, Leyel now initiated a siege on the fortress.\n\n\n== Siege ==\nLeyel was well-received by the local inhabitants of Tranquebar, who had suffered under Pessart’ rule, and now came with food and water to assist the besiegers. The local adrigar at once offered to assist Leyel with his own men. Leyel's army camped behind a stone powder magazine about two musket shots from dansborg. The siege lasted for some time. The Thanjavurians, who were eager to get rid of Pessart and his governorship, now helped Leyel and his men by feeding them.\n\n\n== Negotiations ==\n\nAfter some time, the commander of the guard, Frantz erkmand, with some other men from Dansborg, came out and admitted that there was a shortage of nearly everything in Dansborg. Leyel now showed Erkmand the king's orders, upon which Erkmand promised, on behalf of the garrison, that they would surrender and recognize Leyel as their governor, if Leyel would promise to pardon them on behalf of the king. Leyel could not affort to loose more men on Tranquebar, and thus willingly accepted the demands.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe gates of Dansborg were now opened for Leyel and his men. Yet to his demise, there was not much left but the naked walls. Leyel initiated a closer inspection of dansborg’s buildings and fortifications. There did not seem to be a whole door or window frame in all of the fortifications, and everything was in bad shape. Leyel would, despite setbacks, still try to reestablish the trade and prestige of the Danish East India Company, which had been lost to his predecessor.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTillali Massacre – Massacre and Battle in Tillali, India 1756\nDannemarksnagore – City/town in West Bengal, IndiaPages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback\nThanjavur Maratha kingdom – Principality of Tamil Nadu\nCattle War – Conflict between Danish India and the Thanjavur Maratha kingdom\nSiege of Dansborg (1644) – Siege in Tranquebar, India 1644\nDano-Mughal War – Danish colonial conflict against the Mughal Empire\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Nagai Naomasa (永井直諒, November 24, 1850 - December 14, 1919), was the 13th and final feudal lord of Takatsuki Domain in Settsu Province. He held the title of viscount.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nOn November 24, 1849, Nagai Naotsugu, the third son of Nagai Naotsugu, a daimyo hatamoto who ruled over 7,000 koku, was born into the Nagai clan. On May 16, 1865, in the first year of the Keiō, he inherited the clan estate as an adopted son due to the death of the 12th feudal lord, Nagai Naoya. He also received a fief of 32,300 koku from the shogunate. On December 15 of the same year, he was appointed to the position of Hyuga no kami, a lower fifth rank. On November 17, 1867, he and other daimyo from the Kanagetsu group, including Tsuchiya Toranosuke and Doi Toshio, agreed not to attend the imperial court. On December 21 of the same year, he was appointed as a firefighter in Kyoto. He was also ordered to guard Izumi Choji Temple during the first anniversary of Emperor Komei's death. On January 8, 1868, he went to Kyoto. On March 4 of the same year, he was granted permission by the Meiji government to return to his domain. On April 10 of the same year, he went to Kyoto again. In the Boshin War, he initially adopted a wait-and-see approach, but eventually sided with the new government when it gained the advantage. Takatsuki was an important stronghold leading from Kyoto to Kawachi, and for this reason, Naotsugu was even called the \"Togagoe of the Meiji Restoration\". During his rule, the domain experienced riots, village disturbances, and major floods, leading to a deterioration of the domain's finances. On June 20, 1869, due to the abolition of the han system, he became the head of the domain as a chihanji. On June 13, 1870, he requested the demolition of the gates and towers of Takatsuki Castle. On July 14, 1871, he was dismissed as the governor of the domain due to the abolition of the han system. In 1882, he became a chamberlain in the Imperial Court. In 1884, he was granted the title of Viscount. In 1885, he became a diligent official in the Imperial Household Agency. He died on December 14, 1919, at the age of 71.\n\n\n== Family Genealogy ==\nFather: Naoji Nagai\nMother: unknown\nAdoptive father: Nagai Naoya (1842–1865)\nSpouse: Fusako - Honda Sukemi's adopted daughter, Honda Kensho's daughter\nadopted child\nChildren : Nagai Naomi - daughter of Matsudaira Yoritsune,  Nagai Naokuni (1896–1950) - fifth son of Toda Yasyasu\n\n\n== See also ==\nTakatsuki Domain\nNagai clan\nAbolition of the han system\nList of han\n\n\n== References ==",

The inaugural edition of the contest happened in 2018, and 24-year-old Lucía Peregrín was named the first Miss Grand Almería elected through the provincial pageant. Previously, Almería joined the Miss Grand Spain 2016 contest with the representation of an appointed candidate, Laura Funes.\n\n\n== Editions ==\nThe following table details Miss Grand Almería's annual editions since 2018.\n\n\n== National competition ==\nThe following is a list of Almería representatives who competed at the Miss Grand Spain national pageant.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Miss Grand Spain at Wikimedia Commons\nMiss Grand Spain official website",

There are fine Victorian mansions around the edge of the park, and the park has given its name to a residential area to the north of the park.  Crossley Heath School stands on the western edge of the park, and St Jude's Church, a Grade II listed building designed by William Swinden Barber, stands at the north east corner of the park.\nThe area of the park was historically known as Skircoat Moor or Halifax Moor.  The park takes its current name from the Savile family, which held land in Halifax for centuries and in March 1866 sold land to be set apart as a recreation ground and to be called the Savile Park, on condition that \"it remain unenclosed for perpetuity, and that the council do something about smoke abatement\". \n\n\n== References ==",

Appletreewick fell within the parish of St Wilfrid's Church, Burnsall, and in the 1890s William Stavert was appointed as its minister.  Stavert decided to turn the derelict cottages into a chapel-of-ease, and he designed the new church himself.  It was completed in 1898, and was grade II listed in 1954.\nThe single-storey building is constructed of stone with a stone slate roof.  It consists of a single, rectangular, cell, and has four bays.  The doorway has a chamfered surround and a four-centred arched head, and the windows are mullioned.\n\n\n== See also ==\nListed buildings in Appletreewick\n\n\n== References ==",

Since 1973, NHK only operates one AM radio station in the prefecture, as the Radio 2 station (JOXB) was shut down in order for the Osaka station to increase its power. The Ikeda relay station, which used to relay the Osaka station, has switched in the 2000s to the jurisdiction of the Matsuyama station following the conversion of television signals to digital.\nIn the late 1960s, the Tokushima station held two firsts in Japanese broadcasting. On February 20, 1968, it opened the first UHF television station in Japan, which was the Tokushima station of NHK Educational TV. In March 1969, NHK Tokushima started its FM broadcasting, and in September, NHK Tokushima held the first televised public opinion broadcast for the elections for the post of governor of Tokushima Prefecture.\nOn March 20, 1973, NHK Tokushima Radio 2 station was abolished in order for the Osaka station to increase its power.\nIn September 1985, NHK Tokushima emergency warning broadcast begins. In August 1986, NHK Tokushima General TV audio multiplex broadcasting begins.\nOn September 4, 2006, NHK Tokushima starts broadcasting from the current building, and digital terrestrial television broadcasting begins in October.\nOn May 22, 2023, local programs were added to the NHK Plus platform.\nIn case the Nankai Trough Earthquake happens, the NHK Tokushima Broadcasting Station has a satellite studio located at a short distance from the main building to allow the continuation of broadcasting and editing in case of emergency.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Gracixalus tianlinensis, the Tianlin small tree frog, is a species of frog in the family Rhacophoridae. It is endemic to China's Tianlin County.\nThe adult male frog measures 30.3-35.9 mm in snout-vent length and the adult female frog 35.6-38.7 mm. The head is wider than it is long and there are no vomerine teeth. The skin of the dorsum is brown to beige in color with a dark brown mark shaped like the letter Y. The axilla and tops of the legs are yellow in color. The throat and chest are gray in color. The belly is cream-white in color. The iris of the eye is brown in color with fine black reticulations.\nThis frog has been found on hills in combined evergreen-bamboo forests. It has been observed 1858 meters above sea level. Scientists believe that this frog breeds in streams and that the tadpoles develop in water-filled holes in bamboo, like other frogs in Gracixalus do.\nLittle is known about this frog's range, but it includes at least one protected park: Cenwanglaoshan National Nature Reserve.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Fiorinia externa, the elongate hemlock scale was accidentally introduced into North America from Japan and is now established in most parts of the north-eastern U.S. It has become a serious pest of hemlock (Tsuga) and some related conifers from the family Pinaceae. Dense colonies of the scale insect result in yellowing, shedding of leaves, dieback and occasional tree death.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nFiorinia externa is native to Japan and southern China. It was first reported on Tsuga from New York state in 1908. Compared to other invasive insects, it has spread slowly across the north-eastern U.S. and has reached Georgia in the south, as well as Michigan, Kentucky and Tennesse further west.\nWhile F. externa has not been confirmed to be established in other areas, it is regarded as being of quarantine concern. For example, it has been recorded from other parts of North America like California and Florida on host cuttings. In England, it was reported on a single fir tree imported from the U.S., but subsequently died out on that tree.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe adult female of Fiorinia externa is about 1 mm long. The scale cover of the second instar female is elongated, around 1.5 mm long and has a yellowish-brown, orange-brown or reddish-brown colour. The scale cover of immature males is white. The eggs and crawlers are yellowish and when the crawlers settle, they excrete white wax filaments which may be abundant and give the infested hemlock leaves a whitish appearance.\n\n\n== Biology ==\nWhile more than 50 host plants from 3 conifer families and 9 genera have been reported, the main host plants are hemlock (Tsuga), fir (Abies) and spruce (Picea) species. In North America the most common hosts are Tsuga canadensis, Tsuga caroliniana, Tsuga diversifolia, Abies amabilis, Abies fargesii, Abies veitchii and Picea pungens.\nLike other Fiorinia species, the elongate hemlock scale is a \"pupillarial\" scale, meaning that the adult female remains within the second-instar exuviae. In North America, the overwintering stages are the eggs within the pupillarial female or the fully mature adult females. The eggs hatch in spring and the crawlers migrate to new needles of the same host plant, or may be caried over longer distances by the wind or by birds. There may be one or two generations per year. If there is only one generation, a second one might be started, but with many individuals not surviving the winter.\n\n\n== Importance ==\nWhile Fiorinia externa usually does not kills hemlock trees, the damage caused by heavy infestations can be serious, resulting in yellowing, premature leaf senescence, branch dieback, thinning of the crown and stunting of the host tree.\n\n\n== Management and Biocontrol ==\nSprays with mineral oil (horticultural oil) or the use of systemic pesticides by trunk injection or soil drenches can control the elongate hemlock scale.\nIn North America, natural enemies of F. externa are not very efficient in suppressing the scale populations compared to Japan and as a result, the scale populations in Japan are much smaller. The polyphagous Encarsia citrina is the most important parasitoid of F. externa in North America, but its population cycle is poorly synchronized with that of F. externa, making it often ineffective. In Japan, Encarsia citrina is also an important parasitoid of F. externa, but its population dynamic is well synchronized with the population of the elongate hemlock scale. In addition, various other parasitoids were recorded in Japan.\nSome research has been directed at trying to understand the differences between North America and Japan in the population dynamics of F. externa and E. citrina. It appears that an important reason for the asynchronous populations of scale insects and parasitoids in North America is the overlapping generations of the scale insect which is not seen in Japan. Differences in host quality between Japan and North America could also be a factor.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Men of the Blue Cross (Polish: Błękitny krzyż) is a Polish war narrative-documentary film from 1955 directed by Andrzej Munk, based on Adam Liberak's short story Journey for Life. The film reconstructs the authentic action of the Tatra Volunteer Search and Rescue, which in February 1945 evacuated a partisan mountain hospital through the German-Soviet front line during World War II. In the Men of the Blue Cross, narrated by Gustaw Holoubek, some of the participants of that action appeared, including Stanisław Gąsienica Byrcyn and Stanisław Marusarz.\nMen of the Blue Cross served as a bridge for Munk between his previous documentary work and later achievements in narrative filmmaking. However, the experiment of combining two types of film did not appeal to the contemporary film critics, who criticized Munk for indecisiveness regarding the adopted convention. Only years later was the Men of the Blue Cross partially rehabilitated, largely due to the presence of non-professional actors and the cinematography of Sergiusz Sprudin.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAt the beginning of the film appears the text:The story of this expedition is a true story. The minor changes introduced by the authors in the course of the narrative do not change its essence or meaning in any significant way. Among the characters appearing in the film, we will encounter authentic heroes of that event. It is to them that the authors dedicate this film – to the mountain partisans of the war years and the rescuers of the Tatra Volunteer Search and Rescue – the people of the Blue Cross.The action of the film takes place in February 1945 during World War II, when German garrisons were stationed in Slovakia. Through the snowy Tatra passes wanders a Slovak doctor, Dr. Juraj. He reaches Zakopane, where he contacts the Soviet command, asking for help for his Slovak and Soviet patients from a partisan mountain hospital in a mountain hut, located on the German-occupied side of the Tatras.\nThe action moves to that hut, where the nurse Bożena treats the wounded or those suffering from frostbite. One of the Slovak partisans stands guard, noticing that a German unit has taken up residence in the area. While waiting for help, the partisans light a \"partisan star\" to improve morale. At that moment, the guard enters the hut, informing about the approaching German unit. Meanwhile, one of the wounded patients must have his frostbitten leg amputated.\nMeanwhile, a group of Polish mountain rescuers sets out with the task of transporting the wounded and sick partisans to the Polish side through two mountain chains and German guard lines. Among those in the team heading for the border are experienced mountaineers Stanisław Gąsienica Byrcyn, Stanisław Gąsienica of Las, and Stanisław Marusarz. Crossing the mountain chain is made difficult by the weather conditions (snowstorm) and the couloirs the mountaineers climb. When Byrcyn calls his stubborn dog during the climb, an avalanche unexpectedly falls on the rescuers. However, it turns out that no one was hurt. Along the way, the group encounters a Soviet outpost, reaching the front line.\nSoon, the mountaineers are forced to leave the dog and skis behind and trek through the forest trails to avoid detection by German patrols. At midnight, Juraj arrives with a group of rowers at a mountain hut. After having a meal, the mountaineers take the wounded and conduct the evacuation. However, the Germans track them down, initiating a pursuit of the rescuers. They manage to cross the line of the Soviet outpost and take the dog with the skis, but the covering Soviet soldier is hit. The Slovak guard and Byrcyn separate from the group to cover it from a potential attack by a German patrol. However, gunfire from a nearby Soviet outpost forces the Germans to retreat, allowing Byrcyn and the Slovak guard to rejoin the group. The rowers return to Zakopane on skis, and the action turns out to be a success.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\n\nAfter the production of the documentary Stars Must Burn, Andrzej Munk attempted a creative experiment at the border between narrative and documentary film. Taking Adam Liberak's short story as the starting point for creating Men of the Blue Cross was a novelty for the director, who was an experienced documentarian. The action of the Tatra Volunteer Search and Rescue in February 1945, involving the evacuation of wounded Soviet partisans from behind the German defense line to Zwierówka clearing in the Zuber Valley, served as a point of reference for both the story and the film. Fourteen mountaineers, led by Zbigniew Korosadowicz, participated in the action. However, unlike the events depicted on the screen, the involvement of the mountaineers was not voluntary; the rescuers undertook the action under the threat of death from the Soviet authorities. Marek Lubaś-Harny from Gazeta Krakowska emphasized that \"regardless of political conditions and propaganda efforts, it is difficult not to acknowledge that the action in the Zuber Valley was a difficult to dispute, albeit unusual, success of the Tatra Volunteer Search and Rescue\".\nThe theme of Liberak's prose was close to the director because at the turn of 1944 and 1945, Munk worked as a laborer and a cable car stoker on Kasprowy Wierch. Munk wrote the screenplay himself based on the short story, and the commentary was entrusted to journalist and publicist Karol Małcużyński. Gustaw Holoubek, who embodied the role of the narrator, delivered the commentary with sensitivity. Specialist in documentary filmmaking, Sergiusz Sprudin, was responsible for the cinematography. The director limited the number of professional actors to a minimum (with Wojciech Siemion as an exception), while the main acting roles were played by mountain guides, including Stanisław Byrcyn Gąsienica, Stanisław Gąsienica of Las, Ludwik Ziemblic, Stanisław Marusarz, Józef Krzeptowski, Józef Wawrytka, and Elżbieta Polkowska.\nFilming began in late January and early February 1955 on both the Polish and Czechoslovak (now Slovak) sides of the Tatras. The outdoor shooting process took place in harsh conditions. Some crew members were secured with ropes during the filming of the avalanche scene, which, intentionally triggered, almost cost Byrcyn his life due to the impact. An Arriflex camera was used for shooting. The final scenes were filmed in late February and early March 1955, and the total recorded film material amounted to 1800 meters. The pre-premiere screening of the Men of the Blue Cross took place at the Central Office of Cinematography on 10 October 1955, while the premiere in cinemas occurred on 12 October 1955.\n\n\n=== Editions ===\nIn 2006, the Men of the Blue Cross was released on DVD by the Polish Audiovisual Publishers as part of the Polish School of Documentary series. The reissued version of the Men of the Blue Cross was released along with a collection of other documentaries by Andrzej Munk in 2009.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn Poland, initially the Men of the Blue Cross was met with disappointment. Antoni Kroh recalled that during a screening in Warsaw, during the dramatic scene of the partisan's leg amputation, the audience burst into laughter when the screen partisan began singing a Soviet song. Jerzy Płażewski criticized Munk for being unable to decide whether to create a documentary or a narrative film. Płażewski summed up the Men of the Blue Cross as a \"borderline genre\" that \"did not satisfy either fans of documentary or narrative films\". In a review for Życie Warszawy, Stanisław Grzelecki wrote that the director: \"Limited by the size of the documentary film, and above all by the fundamental assumption, did not go beyond the sketch and, by creating something saturated with possibilities, left the viewer feeling unsatisfied\". Adam Pawlikowski from Przegląd Kulturalny stated that the Men of the Blue Cross gives the impression of an unfinished artistic narrative film, while the level of authenticity in it \"is too weak for the film to be a documentary\". Pawlikowski, however, praised the skillful camera work, considering the cinematography the strongest aspect of the Men of the Blue Cross. On the other hand, Aleksander Jackiewicz argued that Munk's film lacked dramatic intensity, and the Men of the Blue Cross is only \"a neatly made adventure story, in which the man, nature, and fight are just a pretext for sensational action\". Similarly, Jan Antoni Szczepański from Trybuna Ludu evaluated Munk's work as \"a mixing of genres that creates a not very fortunate hybrid and causes dissatisfaction\". However, Szczepański emphasized the propaganda value of the film, recommending it for \"viewing by the widest masses of youth\" and \"promotion by the Union of Polish Youth activists\". Zbigniew Pitera from Film appreciated \"an interesting theme, good direction of several episodes, beautiful cinematography, skillful editing\", but compared the blend of two film genres to \"a greedy ride on the border between both genres\".\nThere were also positive opinions. In a polemical review against Pitera's voice, Czesław Michalski stated that \"Munk [...] is a good rider and firmly sits in the saddle riding on this imaginary barrier, supposedly separating the documentary film from the narrative one\". Kazimierz Dębnicki also attacked Pitera, \"who addressed the theoretical problem of whether such a mixture should be made at all and, having come to the conclusion that it should not, condemned the film in a purely speculative way, defending the principle\". Despite the predominance of negative criticism, the director himself admitted that \"the Men of the Blue Cross convinced me of the impossibility of fully showing the inner experiences of the hero by documentary method\".\nNevertheless, attempts were made to rehabilitate the film. Barbara Mruklik stated that \"from today's point of view, the discussions at that time seem academic, even scholastic\", and the main value of the Men of the Blue Cross is precisely \"the blending of genres [...]. Munk emerged victorious from the documentary attempt to organize material for the needs of a narrative film\". Małgorzata Hendrykowska wrote that the presence of non-professional actors in the Men of the Blue Cross \"gave this sensational story an extraordinary value of authenticity\". Similarly, Thérèse Laforest from the French magazine Séquences considered the film to be \"convincing. This one-hour film, strictly documentary in tone, says everything it wants to say about the courage of the men who really accomplished this feat in February 1945\". Kevin Filipski from The New York Times stated that \"non-professional actors add tension and authenticity to the film\", and most importantly, \"Munk focuses less on conveying ideological messages and more on deepening the drama of the dangerous and heroic mission of the men\". Leslie Camhi from The Village Voice added that the film is important because of \"the spectacular cinematography and the specter of death hanging over all participants in the action\". However, Stuart Klawans from Film Comment had a different opinion, sarcastically assessing the Men of the Blue Cross as a \"typical tribute to the Soviet bloc, full of admiration for the simple, smiling, indomitable people who managed to defeat fascism and still found time to pose for their close-ups\".\nThe Men of the Blue Cross was honored with the bronze medal at the Venice Film Festival, as well as the 2nd Prize at the Trento Film Festival. It was the only Polish feature film from 1955 to be recognized in any way at international festivals. In a plebiscite by the editorial staff of Film in 1956, with the votes of 664 readers, the Men of the Blue Cross ranked fourth on the list of the best Polish films, losing to Irena do domu!, Godziny nadziei and Trzy starty.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nCamhi, Leslie (2002-02-05). \"Pole vault\".

        "content": "Lawrence Caulfield Wyman (20 December 1923 – 25 March 1982) was a British comedy scriptwriter.\nBorn in Brentford, Middlesex, he served in the army in the Second World War.  He later became a scriptwriter at the BBC, working with comedians such as Michael Howard and Derek Roy.  In the early 1950s he linked up with writer Len Fincham, and co-wrote scripts for Morecambe and Wise, Peter Brough, Peter Jones, Jewel and Warriss, and others.\nIn 1958, he approached BBC producer Alastair Scott Johnston with an idea for a comedy series using actor Jon Pertwee, based around the exploits of a military unit.  This developed into The Navy Lark, one of the most successful comedy series in British radio history, starring Pertwee, Leslie Phillips, and Stephen Murray, and also featuring Ronnie Barker.  The series ran through 244 episodes until 1977, with Wyman credited as writer or co-writer throughout, and generated several spin-off series including The Embassy Lark and The Big Business Lark on radio, and HMS Paradise on television. \nSoon after the radio series started in 1959, Wyman co-wrote the script for the unsuccessful film The Navy Lark with Sid Colin.   He also worked with co-writer George Evans on scripts for Bless This House, Love Thy Neighbour and Carry On Dick.\nWyman died in Lambeth, London, in 1982 at the age of 58.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The De opificio mundi (On the Creation of the World) of John Philoponus was a 6th-century commentary on the Genesis creation narrative (or a Hexaemeron). The text is dated sometime between 546 and 560 AD. John, an advocate for Neoplatonism and a follower of the astronomy of Ptolemy, was interested in converging the six-day creation story with the philosophical theory of Aristotle and Plato from a Miaphysite point of view. He also wanted to integrate philosophical approaches with the more stringently literalistic interpretations of Basil of Caesarea.\nJohn came to influence later works such as the Hexaemeron of Jacob of Edessa.\n\n\n== Content ==\nIn the preface of the work, John explains how he came about to writing his Opificio. The work was dedicated to Sergius of Tella, then bishop, who would go on to become the Patriarch of Antioch. He also dedicated it to one of his pupils named Athanasius, the nephew of the empress Theodora. John says that others, especially Sergius, had been pressing him to write an account to refute the pagans in their criticisms of the Book of Genesis, and so defend the Mosaic account of creation, and to refute their belief in the eternity of the world. He sided with the exegetical school known as the School of Alexandria which had also been coming under intellectual pressure from some critics at that time. The name John chose for his work was the same name as the earlier De opificio mundi written by the Jewish philosopher and also advocate of the Alexandrian school of exegesis, Philo of Alexandria. Philo had criticized those searching for scientific information in the scriptures as 'sophists of literalism'. Likewise, the primary fellow Christian that John sought to challenge was also one such literalist, Cosmas Indicopleustes especially as pronounced in his famous work known as the Christian Topography (composed c. 550). Beginning his commentary, John argued that the purpose of Genesis was not to impart a scientific cosmogony but instead to correct the superstitious Egyptians that worshiped the sun, moon, and stars. John sought to explore conceptual scenarios through the use of thought experiments (hypotheses). One of the main modes of thought he sought to criticize in this manner was astrology and the idea that the luminaries were divine beings who moved of their own volition and through their movements influenced worldly affairs. Contrary to this idea, John proposed to explain the movement of the luminaries through an original impetus imparted onto them by God during the creation period and repudiated the notion that the luminaries were divine beings or had any form of astrological influence on the world. For his work on the impetus concept, he is often credited with being the first individual to present a unified theory of dynamics.\nThe second book of the Opificio is an explanation of Genesis 1:2–5 and the first day of creation. The third book is about Genesis 1:6–8, concerning the firmament and the second day of creation. Here, he advocates for the sphericity of the Earth to refute the position of Cosmas. Like Basil of Caesarea's Hexaemeron, John's work explained that the spherical Earth was contained in a spherical heaven. This he says goes against the uneducated Dyophysite \"scriptural fundamentalists\" (flat Earthers) like Cosmas who were uneducated in the scriptures and appear in folly before the pagans.\nLike Augustine, John favored the view that creation was instantaneous and not that it occurred over six literal days. According to John, the creation days do not correspond to normal chronological days, since the agents for the measurement of time were only created on the fourth day (the sun, moon, and stars), and yet days, mornings, and evenings were the terms used as chronological delimiters for the creation acts before that. John sought for a more symbolic meaning of the \"six\" days, and considered many ways in which that might be so: it might have been that the number six was chosen because it corresponds to a combination of the single dimensions of a line or that it a sixfold hierarchy of entities emerging from formless matter. These were meanings that were not historical but reflective of metaphysical truthes.\nJohn also argued on the basis of Genesis 2:7 that human souls are distinguished from animal souls.\n\n\n== Editions and translations ==\nPhiloponus, Ioannes. 1897.

        "content": "Across France Protestants responded to Condé's manifesto and the beginning of the first French War of Religion by seizing cities and taking control of territories. In total around 20 of the 60 largest cities in the kingdom would fall under rebel Protestant control. Among them Lyon, Tours, Amboise, Poitiers, Caen, Bayeux, Dieppe, Blois, Valence, Rouen, Angers, Le Havre, Grenoble, Auxerre, Beaugency, Montpellier, Mâcon and Le Mans. In the areas of Protestant domination iconoclasm and the seizure of churches was often undertaken. Protestant armies attempted to seize more cities that had not fallen to them. Among the leading Protestant commanders were the comte de Crussol (count of Crussol) who assumed a position of leadership in Languedoc and Dauphiné; the baron des Adrets in Dauphiné, the seigneur de Duras (lord of Duras) in Guyenne; the prince de Porcien in Champagne and the comte de Montgommery in Normandie.\nThis decentralised uprising would not be unopposed, and after initially being caught off guard by the sudden and dramatic nature of the conquests, local Catholic royalist commanders would begin to recapture the territories in their provinces. This included figures such as the seigneur de Monluc in Guyenne and Languedoc, the vicomte de Joyeuse (viscount of Joyeuse) in Languedoc; the comte de Sommerive in Provence; the duc d'Aumale in Normandie and the duc d'Ėtampes in Normandie. This would involve street battles to stop attempted Protestant seizures of cities (as in Toulouse and Bordeaux), the reduction of Protestant held cities (as with Poitiers and Rouen) and field battles (as in the defeat of the Protestant army of Duras by Monluc's army at Vergt in October.\nBy the end of 1562 the rebel Protestant presence in much of France had been successfully neutralised. However, in Languedoc and Dauphiné they remained entrenched under Crussol's leadeship. Meanwhile Admiral Coligny oversaw the resurgence of their cause in Normandie shortly before the end of the war.\n\n\n== Picardie ==\n\nThe court moved to assure itself of its control over Picardie and its capital Amiens with the provinces governor in rebellion. Under the legal fiction that Condé was a prisoner of the rebels in Orléans, his brother the cardinal de Bourbon was made governor of Picardie in his stead. Bourbon entered Amiens on 27 July.\n\n\n=== Amiens ===\nThe Protestants had enjoyed great success in assuming influence in Amiens, and by 1562, seventeen of the twenty-four échevins (aldermen) were Protestant. During the ascension day procession, the échevins ensured it would be four of their number who carried the important châsse de Saint-Firmin (shrine of Saint-Firmin). A Protestant served as one of the cities schoolmasters. The remaining Catholic échevins were not willing to allow the Protestant success in the city to continue, and both the mayor and the prévôt (provost) were accused by them of being partisans of the Protestants as far as overseeing the prosecutions of the disorders of 7 and 8 December were concerned. It was further implied by the Catholics that they intended to launch a Protestant coup.\nThe Protestants of Amiens looked to the Protestant lieutenant-general of Picardie, the sieur de Sénarpont and Condé to defend their interests at court. Condé assures them of his protection and for the moment this proved more decisive than the coalition around the bishop of Amiens (which included the bishop of Nantes and Montmorency). Another appeal to the court by the radical Catholic faction was launched on 23 April with the dean of the local chapter travelling to court to get the keys removed from those who currently possess them as 'most of them were Protestants'. Those who travelled to the court highlighted the recent Protestant seizure of Rouen. The court was more sympathetic this time, Condé no longer present to represent the Protestant interests. On 5 May, the mayor and prévôt were replaced by the court, with the latter departing to join Condé in rebellion at Orléans. Within another month, Catherine appointed ten new échevins, all Catholic, giving the Catholics a municipal majority. This new Catholic majority quickly moves to neutralise their Protestant colleagues. The cardinal de Saint-Tryphon visited the city on 22 May to announce that it was the king's will that Protestant worship be proscribed in Amiens and other border cities. The Catholic échevins happily announced the expulsion of Protestant ministers in response. During July the abjuration of all Protestants in Amiens was decreed, with some who refuse to abjure choosing instead to leave the city. In the municipal elections of October a last minute addition to the electoral rules made Protestants ineligible from participating.\n\n\n=== Montdidier ===\nThe royalist recapture of Montdidier was undertaken by deception. Having promised that the Protestants of the city would be safeguarded, the royalist force butchered and expelled them.\n\n\n=== Calais ===\nIn May, the lieutenant-general of Picardie the sieur de Sénarpont made an abortive attempt to capture Calais.\n\n\n== Champagne ==\n\n\n=== Troyes ===\nCondé reached out to his nephew (who happened to also be in the capital when word of Wassy arrived), the Protestant - or at least Protestant sympathetic - governor of Champagne duc de Nevers to source military and financial aid for the cause. Nevers had received the charge of governor of Champagne from his father in 1561, the latter having resigned it to him. Nevers passed the request he received on to the Protestant church of Troyes which was already in the process of arming its members.\nIn Troyes, close to Wassy, tensions were escalating severely between Protestants and Catholics with both accusing each other of interfering with the electoral process in the city. On 6 April, a representative of the duc de Guise, Esclavolles, passed through Troyes. He decided to preside over the election of the échevins which had been delayed, and excluded Protestants from the process. He further took charge in Troyes and demanded the keys. On 10 April he declared only Catholics would guard the gates. The Protestants dispatched a representative to Nevers to warn him that his authority was being usurped. On 12 April, Protestants seized two of the city gates, assaulting the gate keepers. Though there was bloodshed, it was comparatively bloodless in comparison with cities such as Toulouse. A captain on the way to join Condé passed through Troyes, and reported back from Orléans to the Protestants that Condé desired them to obey Nevers. Nevers arrived near Troyes on 19 April, with the intention of calming religious tensions in the city. He was aware that the Protestant community of Troyes had armed and wished to keep the situation under control. He wrote to the court that agitators from outside the town were attempting to escalate the situation. He was eventually able to persuade the Protestants of Troyes to stand down by promising to protect them. Nevers, now corresponding with the crown, adopted a posture of neutrality. Both religions were to guard the gates, and weapons were to be yielded to him. He hoped this would dispel fears of a new massacre of Wassy. However many Protestants refused to hand over their weapons and instead hid them. Protestant troops that had been raised initially at Nevers' request, slipped out of the city to join with Condé on 5 May. Nevers moved to have those who did not live in Troyes expelled from the city. Nevers was frustrated with the Protestant congregation of Troyes for their having sent troops to join with the Protestant rebels. He preferred the company of the Protestant bishop of Troyes Antonio Carraciolo to his co-religionists in the city.\nIn July, the Protestant prince de Porcien was in the area, and threatened an attack against Troyes, though it did not materialise. Fearful of a plague, Nevers retired from Troyes, leaving his more firmly Catholic subordinate des Bordes in charge. Nevers turned his attention to the nearby settlement of Châlons, where he had heard rumours of religious disorder. He was assured by the city council that while a Protestant preacher had been causing problems, the situation was now under control. In August repression against the local Protestant population began in Troyes.\nOn 24 August, des Bordes led an assault against the Protestant held town of Bar-sur-Seine. The Protestant cavalry guarding the town fled, and des Bordes oversaw a massacre of 140 Protestant inhabitants. Nevers' gendarme company participated in the killings, and according to Carroll the attack could not have happened without his approval. For Nevers, this was a military action against rebels, and therefore justified. According to the local contemporary historian Nicolas Pithou they tore out the heart of one of the Protestants and then took turns biting it. Those who survived were brought back to Troyes for trial, and then executed.\nBar-sur-Seine once more fell to Protestant forces in January 1563, this prompted a new round of persecutions and killing in Troyes.\n\n\n=== Sens ===\nWhen the Protestants of Sens initially began pushing to receive churches, the mayor refused on the ground that the edict of Saint-Germain had not been registered. After it was registered he altered course to insisting the preachers of Sens speak out against the edict. On 29 March while returning to Courtenay from Sens where they had held a service a group of Protestants were attacked by Catholic boatmen. Local Protestant gentleman quickly intervened to protect them, but services were nevertheless suspended for the time being.\nBefore taking action, the Protestants looked to Nevers for leadership, but none came. While they stalled, the royalist Catholics of the city took the initiative. A militia was established (financed by the clergy), the gates secured and the artillery seized. A meeting was held among the Catholic grandees of Sens to decide how to proceed. It was decided to raze the Protestant church in Sens, on the day of the pilgrimage for St Savinien, when their numbers would be able to overpower the Protestants strong representation among the magistracy of the city. On the day the Catholic militia stood guard as the people of Sens tore down the church. Arrests of the Protestant leadership then began, and though chaotic did not descend into bloodshed in the morning. In the afternoon the Protestant captain returned and began preparing for a counter offensive, uniting with a band of co-religionists in a fortified house and then bursting out to attempt to push the Catholics back out of the neighbourhood. The captain attempted to make contact with a gendarmerie company of Coligny's. The Catholics brought up artillery and the captain was killed, with his unit dispersed. The general massacre then began. Canons invited peasants from the surrounding countryside into Sens to participate in the killing. According to the Protestants, 52 houses were pillaged and around 100 killed. Not all the killed were Protestants, with one Catholic magistrate being killed as he left mass. The parlement would investigate the incident but did not find anyone guilty.\n\n\n=== Reims ===\nIn Reims, there was relatively little risk of any Protestant uprising, the city would not be subject to any external attack or internal disorder during the war. Nevertheless, the baron de Cerny was appointed governor of the city in July. He ordered the council draw up a list of Protestants in the city, which was happily complied with by the city council. They provided Cerny a list of 25 names in September. No action was taken with the information on this list, as it was apparent the named were either not actually Protestants or presented no military threat to the city.\nThe duc de Nevers led an assault on a Protestant held château near Reims. He and his 1,600 soldiers tricked the garrison into emerging from the château and then slaughtered them.\n\n\n=== Porcien's campaign ===\nThe prince de Porcien spent the spring pillaging the countryside of Champagne. He operated primarily from a base at Montcornet in northern Champagne. He initially made his way to join with Condé in Orléans, attempting to surprise Provins on route with the support of the towns Protestant bailli (baillif). After a couple of months with Condé he returned to Champagne via Strasbourg. In Strasbourg he recruited 100 cavalrymen. In July he was back in Champagne, operating around Joinville with the support of the seigneur d'Esternay who had been dispatched to the province by Condé. In response to the military threat his presence in the province posed, the town of Châlons introduced a garrison of around 300 soldiers for its defence against him. This was not satisfactory for the governor, the sieur de Bussy who tried to push another three companies on Châlons on the grounds that many Protestants were in the area, and could surprise Châlons at any moment. The city council rebuffed this offer, content in the services of their royal captain the sieur de Castel for their security. They argued more troops would worsen the plague, and moreover the number they had was sufficient. Bussy began selling off the property of Protestants that had fled from Châlons in August. While the council acquiesced to this, it refused Bussy's request for a list of all the Protestants resident in Châlons. During Autumn, Porcien returned, and his force began pillaging the area between the Meuse and Marne.\nOn 25 August, Porcien began a siege of Sainte-Menehould, which was governed by the sieur de Bussy. He brought to bear 4,000 foot soldiers and a further 800 cavalry. Bussy had entrusted the defence of Sainte-Menehould to a captain Lescouardin, who was able to repulse Porcien's attack. During the combat Porcien was wounded, and lifted the siege, his forces returning to plundering the surrounding countryside. The abbeys of Châtrices, Moirement, Moutier and Beaulieu were sacked by his men. During September his force successfully captured the château and priory of Sermaize.\n\n\n== Normandie ==\n\nIconoclastic action and church seizures would occur in many Norman towns and cities including: Rouen, Dieppe, Caen, Caudebec, Jumièges, Saint-Martin-de-Boscherville, Bayeux, Elbeuf, Barentin, Limesy, Coutances, Avranches, Sées, Saint-Lô, Saint-Wandrille and Le Tréport. Now led by the more 'respectable' elements of Protestant society the iconoclasm was more systematic with inventories drawn up and auctions organised. The funds were to be used to fund the movement in the province.\nDuring May Saint-Lô, Bayeux, Falaise, Vire, Lisieux, Carentan, Pont de l'Arche and Le Havre fell to Protestant rebel control.\n\n\n=== Bouillon's party ===\nThe Protestant governor of Normandie did not affiliate with the rebel Protestants, or the crown and instead established a third party the purpose of which revolved around reinforcing his own authority in the province. \n\nGovernor Bouillon was furious that the duc d'Aumale and the seigneur de Matignon had been provided with powers of lieutenant-generalcy in Normandie on 14 May to restore order in the province. Matignon was a client of the queens, and she hoped he would serve as a counterweight to Aumale. Even though Aumale was his uncle-in-law, Bouillon saw these commissions as attacks on his authority. He therefore established a headquarters in the château de Caen and with the support of local Protestants besieged Matignon in Cherbourg. Matignon undertook to increase the defences of Cherbourg while he awaited reinforcements.\nProtestants and Catholics were able to exist together peaceably under Bouillon's auspices. Indeed, on 19 March 1563, Bouillon would introduce a policy of religious coexistence inside Sedan, a territory over which he was prince.\nBouillon corresponded with the court, complaining that the money he was owed for the campaigns he was conducting went unpaid. With the intervention of Guise and the duc de Montpensier at court in his favour the commissions of his captain Berteville were recognised and he was granted commission over three companies while Bouillon was allowed to utilise the treasury of Caen.\nLate in 1562, he tried to put his captains in place, and gain acceptance for the return of Protestant refugees to the towns of Saint-Lô and Bayeux both of which were under Catholic control. They refused, and Bouillon declared the towns to be enemies of the king, lodging an appeal with the court.\n\n\n=== Caen ===\nOn 28 April, the duc de Bouillon wrote to the officers of the baillage of Caen. He thanked them for the diligence they had shown in the maintenance of the city to this point. He informed them the crown had granted full powers to the captain d'Hugueville to act as governor. Soon thereafter, d'Hugueville ordered the stockpiling of foodstuff in the château. Dauvin thus speculates that d'Hugueville anticipated an attack.\nAccording to a Catholic eyewitness the minister announced his intention to see the town rid of 'idols' in front of the judiciary of the city. With d'Hugueville seemingly preparing for an attack, a great wave of iconoclasm broke out on the evening of 8 May and continued through 9 May. This came shortly after the destruction of images in Rouen on 3–4 May. According to the later account of Bourgueville all the churches and monasteries were attacked with their images destroyed, windows shattered, ornaments pillaged and flammable elements all thrown into fires. One of the first targets for destruction was a fifteen feet tall cross under the window of one of the présidial judges. The city militia despite being close to much of the action maintained a complicit neutrality. Bourgueville would estimate the damage of the two days to be at the value of 100,000 écus. According to the historian it was only the arrival of Matignon which prevented an assault on the château from following the destruction of the churches.\nThe présidial court was divided between Protestants of a legalist persuasion who disapproved of iconoclasm, and those of a more revolutionary persuasion who approved of the acts. Bourgueville states (as an eyewitness) that when the iconoclasts presented themselves before the body after conducting their deeds, one of the Protestant justices absolved them of any criminal liability. The iconoclasts were paid for the work they had undertaken. By the violence of these days Catholic worship was de facto suspended. However the Protestants of Caen remained divided on whether to seize the opportunity and impose Protestantism on the city. While control would be assumed over many churches, the civic bodies of the city would continue to function as before, and the Protestants had failed to secure the château.\nCatherine entrusted the duc de Bouillon with overseeing the preservation of Caen for the royalist cause. Bouillon arrived in front of the château on 20 May with two companies of soldiers. Bouillon made d'Hugueville depart his charge and then the city, alleging that the captain wished to establish Aumale over Caen. Locking himself up in the château, Bouillon had the nearby collegiate church destroyed with cannons on the grounds that its elevated position near the château was a security risk. He ordered the systematic looting of the remaining silverware from the churches of Caen to finance several companies of light horse under the Protestant commanders the sieur de Fervaques and Jean de Pellevé both of whom had been or would be responsible for the destruction of Catholic religious property. \nOn 4 September, Bouillon oversaw the ousting of the majority of the recently elected échevins replacing them with his own Protestant appointees. In doing this he took advantage with royal frustration with the municipal authorities of Caen.\nIn September the Protestant commander Montgommery was operating around Caen with around 3,000 footsoldiers and 800 horsemen. With the duc de Bouillon absent, he attempted to seize the city but the attempt was foiled with the conspirators inside Caen hanged.\nBouillon sponsored a delegation from Caen that plead with the court for liberty of conscience. The court responded on 21 October with an order that all Protestant preachers in Caen must depart on pain of death, with public Protestant worship prohibited. The governor of Normandie was able to broker a compromise by which public worship would cease but liberty of conscience and private practice of Protestantism would be permitted. This was published on 3 November. Nevertheless, Protestant ministers would have to depart from Caen.  On 29 November the crown established a new captain of the château and city, the sieur de Renouard, a client of Jean III d'Annebault. While some of the Protestants of the city sought to make a good impression on their new commander, others felt with the loss of Bouillon a new protector was required.\nRenouard undertook the disarmament of the population of Caen and saw to the transfer of all municipal arsenals contents to the château. By these means the Protestants of the city feared they would soon be subject to a similar repression as their co-religionists in Rouen.\nOn 14 February Coligny entered Caen. According to de Bèze the Protestant occupation came as a response to governor Renouard attempting to undertake a massacre of the cities Protestant population before being stopped and pushed back by some exiles from Rouen. Meanwhile, according to the local historian Bourgueville, the Protestants took advantage of the poor authority enjoyed by the governor to see the gates opened for Coligny. Dauvin, highlighting an incident with the bell a couple of days prior finds the latter account more credible. Coligny's entry without need for a prolonged siege was a great scandal. With the city secured Coligny turned to the château where Renouard was held up and put it to siege. He was aided in his efforts by 2,000 English soldiers under Throckmonton. On 2 March Elbeuf surrendered the château to him. From 5 March de Bèze preached for ten days in Caen. Coligny departed Caen on 16 March after ordering the removal of the lead roofing of the abbey church, which would be melted down and sold for 80,000 livres. Montgommery was established as the cities new governor.\n\n\n=== Dieppe ===\nNo sooner did word arrive of what had transpired at Wassy than Dieppe entered into a state of disorder with the Protestants assuming control of the city on 22 March. In the violence that followed 150 Protestants and Catholics would be killed. The Protestant captain of Dieppe, Ponsard was a client of Coligny's.\nThe governor of Normandie, the duc de Bouillon visited Dieppe in April. He was granted a ceremonial entry into the city, but was informed his choice of governor for the city (a Catholic) was unacceptable. His failure to restore either Dieppe or Rouen to obedience with the crown led to his replacement as military leader of Normandie by the duc d'Aumale.\nThe Protestants of Dieppe, now in control came to the aid of nearby co-religionists who were more vulnerable. Cany, Veules and Saint-Valéry-en-Caux were thus attacked from Dieppe when news reached the city that there were 2,000 Catholic peasants in the area.\nThe commander of Dieppe, the seigneur de Briquemault was appointed as commander of Rouen in September. However, Briquemault would remain in Dieppe, writing appeals to Elizabeth for support without result. With the city subject to a siege he agreed to its surrender on 30 October. The English garrison was expelled on condition that private Protestant worship be respected. This surrender came in part from fear at seeing the brutal sack which Rouen had recently been subjected to. The Protestant governor who had replaced Bricquemalt, the sieur de La Curé was chased out of the city after the surrender.\nIn early 1563 Dieppe was again besiged. This time the comte de Brissac in command of a royalist force led the effort. Command of the defence was in the hands of the comte de Montgommery.\n\n\n=== Rouen ===\nIn Rouen, word of the massacre of Wassy inspired panic and preparation from the cities Protestant population. This was then combined with word of Condé's manifesto. Therefore, when two Norman royal recruiters visited the city to raise soldiers, they were attacked, accused of plotting a new Wassy. One of them received injuries while the other was killed. The bailli of Rouen, Villebon visited the city a few days later. Villebon was an ultra-Catholic who over the prior years had developed an infamous reputation with the cities Protestants. Protestants accused him (either genuinely or disingenuously) of plotting to seize the weapons in the hôtel de ville (city hall) and therefore on 15 April the Protestants seized first the convent of the Celestines, and then the hôtel de ville. The beleaguered Villebon was besieged in the cities château. He quickly surrendered and fled, leaving the Protestants the masters of Rouen on 17 April, his lieutenant who was held up in the Vieux Palais having likewise surrendered. Control of Rouen (and Le Havre) allowed the Protestants to dominate the lower Seine. On 19 April the duc de Bouillon arrived in the city. The new leaders of the city stressed their continued loyalty to the king, arguing that they had only acted to prevent a new Wassy. Frustrated that the city would not in fact actually return to obedience, Bouillon departed, leaving his lieutenant the sieur de Martel in the city. In the city Catholic Mass was allowed to continue, and the Catholic members of the city council were left in place. This could not contain the more radical in the city, and Protestants went from church to church smashing Catholic paraphernalia and pulling it from the churches to burn in large bonfires. Catholic homes were invaded and arms seized. Therefore, by the end of May, most Catholics had departed Rouen. On 14 May, in the wake of the Protestant iconoclasm, Bouillon's lieutenant Martel withdrew from Rouen. The Parlement left into exile, and the Council of Twenty Four became solely Protestant in June. The Protestants of the city began a systematic weighing and melting down of precious metals in the city, and by this means raised around 57,000 livres which was put towards paying the garrison and preparing the cities fortifications.\nCatherine negotiated with the city during this time, offering leniency in return for re-admission of royal officials into Rouen. The Rouennais leaders demanded that the recent commission granted to the duc d'Aumale to raise troops across the region be revoked. Catherine could not consent to this. On 28 May, Aumale arrived before Rouen and demanded the gates be opened to him, the city refused. He began a weak siege, lacking enough in the way of force (possessing only around 3,000 men) to truly threaten the city. He contented himself to harass the city. Meanwhile, he issued commissions to sympathetic nobles such as Villebon, and the clients of Brissac. Protestant soldiers from around Rouen flocked to the cities defence. The combined Rouennais and external Protestant forces launched raids on nearby towns, such as Darnétal, Elbeuf and Caudebec. The Protestant commander in charge of Rouen at this time was the seigneur de Morvilliers who oversaw the receipt of reinforcements to resist Aumale from Orléans. Morvilliers could count on around 4,000 men in the city during June.\nThe exiled parlement, established at Louviers radicalised quickly, devoid of its chief moderates the minority ultra faction took charge. The parlement issued an arrêt in which they declared that Protestant worship would be prohibited in the regions of Normandie under royalist control. The parlements penchant for hanging random Protestants forced the court to despatch Michel de Castelnau in August to restrain their extreme impulses.\nAumale returned for a second attempt at besieging Rouen on 29 June, installing batteries in front of forte Sainte-Catherine. He would however achieve little more success at reducing the city than he had in his prior siege. He contented himself with giving licence to the nearby peasantry to attack the Protestant nobility. He financed himself through plunder, requisitioning the cloth of the Rouennais merchants that was at Brionne. In September Morvilliers found himself in conflict with his co-religionist Montgommery over the latters desire to supplement the cities defence with English forces and withdrew from the city. To replace Morvilliers the seigneur de Bricquemault was chosen, however he could not reach Rouen.\n\n\n=== Honfleur ===\nOn 21 July, Honfleur was seized by the duc d'Aumale.\n\n\n=== Bayeux ===\nThe bishop of Bayeux was captured by Protestants, but the Catholic townspeople were able to successfully see to his release.\n\n\n=== Le Havre ===\n\nOn 16 April, Le Havre was seized by the Protestant commander Maligny, who had been involved in the conspiracy of Amboise. In assuming control he expelled from command the Catholic lieutenant Jean de Cros. This came as a blow to the royalist cause as it facilitated contact with England. His seizure of Le Havre was of considerable concern to the government, as it was the primary port of supply. As a term of the treaty of Hampton Court, Le Havre was to be handed over to the English. An English force departed Portsmouth on 1 October and received Le Havre on 4 October.\nThe English commander of Le Havre, the earl of Warwick was besieged by Marshal de Vielleville during December. Vielleville based himself out of Caudebec for the purpose of the siege. During January around 7,000 German mercenaries were involved in the siege, and they terrorised the countryside around Le Havre.\n\n\n=== Vire ===\nIn August there would be Catholic riots in Vire, with the duc de Bouillon re-establishing order.\n\n\n=== Caudebec ===\nThe day after the capture of Le Havre, the Protestants secured Caudebec by means of an uprising. Troops loyal to the Protestant cause had been secreted into the city in prior days, which enabled Caudebec to resist an attempted siege by a local royalist force.\n\n\n=== Lisieux ===\nOn 5 May the Protestant bailli of Évreux and the captain of Tancarville, a client of Longueville's, jointly pillaged the cathedral town of Lisieux.\nWhen the duc de Bouillon arrived at Lisieux he ensured the resumption of Catholic worship in the town. He would however provide a Protestant governor to counterbalance this restoration.\n\n\n=== Tancarville ===\nThe Protestant prince Longueville's château at Tancarville became a haven for Protestant fleeing from Catholic attacks. In October Longueville wrote to the captain of Tancarville instructing him to surrender the château to the royalists.\n\n\n=== Valognes ===\nPeace was initially maintained between Catholics and Protestants in Valognes. A bi-confessional assembly of notables agreed to resist calls to arm and expel populations and instead abide by the king's edicts together in peace. A bi-confessional militia was able to keep the peace when there was an incident around Pentecost. However, on 7 June Catholic militia-men fired on a group of Protestant notables. Most of the Protestants were able to escape thanks to the protection of their Catholic neighbours. The killing would not go unavenged, and a local Protestant force entered the town and killed a Franciscan monk.\nBouillon for his part despatched a military provost to Valognes to punish the perpetrators. The Catholics of Valognes threw the provost into prison and declared that their loyalty was not to Bouillon but rather to the lieutenant-general Matignon in Cherbourg. Bouillon therefore attacked and conquered Valognes with 2,200 men and had some of the rioters hanged, before making preparations to attack Cherbourg.\n\n\n== Lyonnais ==\n\n\n=== Lyon ===\n\nIt was not possible to establish the Edict of Saint-Germain in the kingdom's second city as it was increasingly consumed by more extreme factions of Protestants (who wanted total freedom of worship) and Catholics determined to resist the edicts application.\nThe governor the comte de Sault, who though not Protestant himself, was sympathetic to Protestantism, was suspected of involvement in the Protestant coup that seized the city on the night of 29 April. He had been appointed to the charge in 1561. In the proceeding months, the administration of Lyon had paid La Motte-Gondrin to quarter his troops outside the city proper (leaving him in the faubourg de Vaise) and turned down a request by Saint-André to construct a fortified gate on the Saône bridge, by which means the more Protestant parts of the city could have been isolated.\nOnly the canons of Saint-Jean and the governor put up resistance to the Protestant coup that acquired the city. The church of Saint-Nizier and the hôtel de ville were seized, the former protected with guards. The towers that guarded the squares were likewise conquered. The cathedral of Lyon was subject to a sacking, with a Protestant pastor invading the cathedral sword in hand to this end. Thus the Protestants acquired what they had failed to seize in September 1560. One of the Protestant ministers of Lyon, Jacques Ruffy was particularly involved in the violent seizure of the city who even bore arms. This action was reported to Genève, and earned Ruffy a rebuke from Calvin, with Calvin going on to chide the ministers of the city generally for their role in the coup. Calvin highlighted that he had been informed Ruffy had confronted the governor of Lyon with a pistol and boasted of the Protestant forces in the city. Soon after the Protestant conquest, the baron des Adrets arrived, he had not been given a commission to govern Lyon (his authority limited to Dauphiné), but he assumed it unilaterally. There was little protest to his acquisition, as it was assumed he would soon depart back to Dauphiné.\nThe new Protestant administration of Lyon prohibited the participation of Catholics in the cities consulate. Many of the bankers of the city were Catholic and departed, however some affiliated themselves with the Protestant administration. Lyon was governed by the brutal Protestant commander the baron des Adrets from May to July. He had the former clerical property of the city carefully inventoried  while other items were destroyed. His brutal command was so displeasing to Condé and Coligny that he was replaced in the city by the sieur de Soubise in July. Soubise wrote to Catherine explaining that he remained totally loyal to the king and that as soon as Charles and Catherine were at liberty he would restore Lyon to their control and obey all their commands. In September, orders were issued in the 'name of the king' by which blasphemy and gaming were outlawed, with attendance of Protestant services made mandatory. Commerce was to be prohibited during hours of worship.\nThe city held out against attempts by the royalist duc de Nemours to reduce it. The Protestants would hold Lyon until 1563 when it was returned to the royalist fold through negotiation as opposed to military force.\nAfter the disgrace of Adrets from the Protestant cause, the seigneur de Montbrun would assume the military role he had held over the Lyonnais, Dauphiné and Vivarais.\n\n\n== Maine ==\nThe royalist Catholic sieur de Champagne et de Parcé was responsible for the conduct of various atrocities in Maine. He had suspected Protestants thrown into a deep lake, and was reported to have remarked as he did that he would make them 'drink from his big bowl'.\n\n\n=== Le Mans ===\nIn Le Mans, the Protestants forced their bishop Charles d'Angennes to flee from the city around the time of the Massacre of Wassy. A meeting was conducted to plan for the seizure of the city on 1 April at the hôtel de Vignolles under the leadership of the seigneur de la Rochère featuring various grandees of the city. Control of Le Mans itself was secured by the rebels on 3 April. The Protestant seizure was accompanied by a wave of pillage against the churches and convents of the city. Treasures were removed from the cathedral, manuscripts were set ablaze. The cardinal de Luxembourg was disinterred from his resting place. The primary offenders in this destruction were the bourgeois and 'notables' segments of the Protestant population. With the Catholic population fleeing, the city remained in the hands of Protestant soldiers for three months. The cities Protestant military leader was La Motte Thibergeau and he was supported by the future comte de La Suze (a cousin of the sieur de Champagne's). On 29 April, the Protestants of Le Mans' remonstrated the king, echoing the manifesto that Condé had issued, they plead with the king to hear their arguments about the cruelty of Guise, the 'architect of Wassy'. On 11 July, the bishop returned at the head of a military company and re-secured the city for the royalists. Back in power, the bishop went house to house across the nobility of Le Mans securing participation in a Catholic League he had founded. La Motte Thibergeau led an exodus of Protestants into Normandie.\n\n\n== Anjou ==\nThe governor of Anjou, Touraine and Maine, the duc de Montpensier, found himself short on artillery for the conduct of his local campaign. He therefore made request of the governor of Bretagne, Étampes, who informed him that no captain in his province would provide such resources to him without his explicit authorisation. After Étampes wrote to the local commanders, Montpensier would receive Breton powder.\n\n\n=== Angers ===\nIn Angers, Montpensier oversaw brutalities against Protestants. At his instruction the Protestants were variously hanged, beheaded and beaten.\nThe city was conquered for the rebel Protestant cause by an alliance of the urban and rural nobility. La Rochefoucauld was operating around Angers in May, keen to revenge himself for Montpensier's cruelties.\n\n\n== Touraine ==\n\n\n=== Tours ===\nMontpensier, governor of Touraine, oversaw the execution of a butcher of Tours who was found to be selling meat during Lent. Following this some Protestants were imprisoned in the residence of the archbishop. Montpensier then retired to his estates at Champigny, leaving the field open to the Protestants.\nOn 30 March, prior even to Condé's capture of Orléans, a group of several hundred Protestants captured the château de Tours with little resistance. A few days later the rest of the city fell to them. Representatives from Condé in Orléans soon arrived. With the city in their hands the cathedral of Tours was subject to iconoclastic violence alongside the abbey of Saint-Martin where the shrine was broken on 5 April. Precious metals were melted down and sent off to pay Condé's emerging army in Orléans. Saints remains were also burned, as was the fate of saint François de Paule who was kept in Plessis-lès-Tours.\nIn July Saint-André put Tours to siege. The Protestants negotiated their safe withdrawal and surrendered the city. Saint-André proved either unable or unwilling to honour this agreement. Hundreds were massacred and thrown into the river Loire. The Protestant mayor was dismissed and all Protestants still alive in the city were to swear a confession of faith to Catholic judges or depart the city. When Montpensier arrived in the city he ordered a list of all the Protestants in the administration be drawn up so that they might be purged.\nMontpensier did not find governing easy in this period. In December 1562, he wrote to the court protesting that all his requests for royal favours for his clients went unanswered, leaving him unable to command respect or maintain his fidelity network properly. It was only through his personal funds that Montpensier was able to reward those who served him, he protested.\n\n\n=== Chinon and Loudon ===\nGuise oversaw the recapture of Chinon and Loudon for the royalist cause.\n\n\n== Bourgogne ==\nAfter the departure of the governor Aumale to Normandie, the duc de Guise was established as governor in his absence.\n\n\n=== Dijon ===\n\nA Protestant plan to seize Dijon by internal coup was foiled. The mayor and city council of Dijon wrote to Aumale, pleading with him to greenlight the arrest of all Protestants who violated the Edict of Saint-Germain. This was despite the fact the council had little intention to register the edict or enforce its terms of toleration. Among many grievances voiced by the council to their governor the centrepiece was the Protestant attacks on the Eucharist. In total they made twelve complaints to Aumale which covered the range of social life from the election of the previous year to observance of feast days. Tavannes, the lieutenant-general of the province, began acting without waiting for word from Aumale. On 8 May he ordered all Protestant preachers in Dijon present themselves before the hôtel de ville the next morning, so that they could receive safe conduct out of Dijon. Any who did not leave would be liable to be hanged without judicial process. Tavannes was encouraged in his efforts by Catherine, who wrote to him in June that he should continue his efforts to cleanse Bourgogne from the 'plague of heresy' introduced by preachers into the region. The lieutenant-general ordered the council to undertake a survey of Dijon in which all heads of households would be asked to swear that they would live and die as Catholics. They also supplied him with a force of 500 men to expel from Dijon those who refused. Tavannes would later boast in his memoires that he had expelled around 1500 valets huguenots from Dijon, largely Swiss and German immigrants.\nOf the cities roughly 500-600 Protestants, many fled the city before the government of Dijon could begin to suppress them.\n\n\n=== Mâcon ===\nAfter the Protestant seizure of Mâcon in Bourgogne, the lieutenant-general of Bourgogne Tavannes prepared to counter-attack. He requested 200 militiamen from Dijon to support him in the attack against Mâcon, the Dijon council despatched 500 to him instead. Mâcon fell to the royalists sometime before 2 September. This proved disheartening to Protestant refugees from Toulouse who fled to Genève.\n\n\n=== Auxerre ===\nUpon the Catholic recapture of Auxerre a large scale massacre followed at the impetus of the troops. According to Protestant accounts around 100 people were killed.\n\n\n=== Tavannes campaign ===\nTavannes succeeded in gaining mastery over the Saône valley during June. He captured Châlon from the Protestant seigneur de Montbrun (who had taken the city on 31 May) then succeeded in capturing Mâcon by a surprise assault. He further repulsed an attempted move of 6,000 Swiss soldiers out from Lyon, forcing them to retreat to the city. He was assisted in these campaigns, by 4,000 Swiss of his own, which had arrived in June.\n\n\n== Trois-Évêchés ==\nIn the Trois-Évêchés (Three-Bishoprics) the rebel Protestants attempted to undertake an attack on Verdun during 1562. The attack stalled before one of the city gates over which there was a niche featuring Mary. According to the defenders Mary turned to face them to indicate her support for their cause, and this began a tradition in the city.\n\n\n== Poitou ==\nIn Poitou, the Protestants seized Fontenay, Luçon, La Châtaigneraie, Chantonnay, Le Puybelliard, Foussais, Monsireigne, Thiré and Pouillé. The Cathedral of Luçon was subject to a thorough sack of what could be found inside on 30 April. In the surrounding areas of pillaged churches only Protestant worship existed. Catholic counter-attacks result in reprisals and revenge killings. Fontenay was recaptured by Catholic forces in July 1562, the Protestants of the town either leaving or being arrested.\n\n\n=== Poitiers ===\nCondé's manifesto reached Poitiers on 13 April. Initially the Catholics and Protestants of the city decided to collaborate in control of the gates. After the Catholics at the gates denied entry to a Protestant noble to the city, the Protestants took over the Tranchée gate and let in the troops of their co-religionists. This was not however the end of attempts to compromise in Poitiers, and while there were incidents of iconoclastic violence, others swore to maintain the peace.\nBoth sides manoeuvred to assure themselves of control of the château, and by May the receveur général François Pineau was in firm control of the château, while all the gates were in the hands of the Protestants. Condé dispatched the sieur de Sainte-Gemme as his governor of the city. After his arrival he confiscated all the gate keys, the valuables of the churches and insisted the Catholics disarm. He allowed troops under the seigneur de Grammont to pass through the city, and during their stay they sacked many of the churches. Despite Sainte-Gemme's overarching control of Poitiers, he lacked control of the château. Pineau resisted all attempts towards his removal.\nThe sieur de Sainte-Gemme served as the rebel replacement to the royal lieutenant-general of Poitou, the comte de Lude, who responded by retreating to Niort.\nWhen forces under Saint-André and Villars arrived outside the city and began an attack, Pineau allied himself with the cities attackers, turning the guns of the château on the defenders of the city, aiding their victory. The siege of Poitiers lasted ten days. The victorious royal army subjected Poitiers to a thorough sack on 31 May. Saint-André had the Protestant mayor Herbert hanged alongside many other Protestants of the city.\nCondé had entrusted a force under the command of La Rochefoucauld with frustrating Saint-André's campaign, however he was driven into Saintonge by Saint-André.\n\n\n=== Saint-Maixent ===\nIn Saint-Maixent the Protestants engaged in iconoclasm and then seized the church of the Cordeliers. After some Protestants passed by on their way to Poitiers, the Protestants claimed that the Catholic prior of the town had committed an offence against their pastor during his prayers. He was arrested but this was not sufficient for the Protestants. They approached the mayor and échevins under arms, asking that the prior be handed over to them so they could kill him. Facing refusal they marched on the château but were dispersed by forces of the lieutenant Cherray.\n\n\n== Angoumois ==\nThe Protestants seized Angoulême, Cognac and Aubeterre in the Angoumois. After the capture of the former, the tomb of the French king Jean II was subject to abuses. The other cities were subject to looting also.\nAfter the royal recapture of Poitiers, the Protestant held cities of Angoulême and Cognac were recaptured, each one witnessed reprisals and violence with its recapture.\n\n\n== Saintonge ==\nThe Protestant nobility of Saintonge came together in April and chose Saint-Martin de La Coudre as their leader. In combination with forces from neighbouring Poitou and the Angoumois this force marched north to rendezvous with Condé at Orléans. The nobility had taken the lead over the clerical elements of Protestantism, which in Saintonge had met in Saint-Jean-d'Angély to issue the call to arms.\n\n\n=== Saint-Jean-d'Angély ===\n\nA Protestant synod of some description was held in Saint-Jean-d'Angély on 25 March. Noblemen and ministers were present for a discussion as to whether armed resistance was justified in response to the 'captivity' of the royal family and to defend liberty of conscience (Kingdon notes that at this time Guise and Navarre had yet to assume control of Catherine and Charles). The assembly concluded that they did possess the right in that circumstance to assume arms. The call to arms also pre-dated the seizure of Orléans.\nDuring October, the comte de La Rochefoucauld was in the process of besieging Saint-Jean-d'Angély until word arrived of the defeat of the seigneur de Duras by Monluc, and he hurried to put himself at the head of the remaining Protestant forces from the battle so they could still make it north to Orléans.\n\n\n== Aunis ==\n\n\n=== La Rochelle ===\n\nIn La Rochelle, a degree of order was maintained at first. Though the city elected a Protestant mayor in response to the massacre of Wassy, the governor assured Catherine the city was largely composed of good men. He urged Catherine to further expand religious liberties, and reinforce his gendarmerie to keep the peace in the city. Neither request was responded to. Condé's appeal for financial aid was answered by a Rochelais pastor, but Jarnac and the council were able to counter this by having him expelled. On 31 May a wave of iconoclastic violence swept La Rochelle with many churches being sacked. The Protestant mayor and Jarnac condemned the acts. La Rochefoucauld entreated La Rochelle and Jarnac to declare for Condé over the course of several embassies however Jarnac refused and the council sent deputies to the king professing their loyalty to the crown. La Rochefoucauld decided to organise a coup in La Rochelle, however it was discovered shortly before it was due to go off on 26 September. Jarnac confronted the rebel Protestants firing on them with cannons from the arsenal, driving them from the city.\nAfter the failure of this conspiracy, the duc de Montpensier, who was commanding royal forces in Guyenne, made known his desire to visit La Rochelle. To assuage urban concern he promised it would only be with a personal retinue of 40 men. This was a lie, and along with Jarnac, who was aggrieved by La Rochefoucauld's attempted coup, he introduced several hundred of his soldiers into La Rochelle disguised as common people. On 27 October they assumed control of the city and allowed a regiment of Montpensier's troops into La Rochelle. In the wake of the coup, Jarnac became loathed by many in La Rochelle, and he left on 3 November, threatened with assassination. Montpensier banned Protestantism in La Rochelle and expelled Protestant pastors. He further deposed the Protestant mayor. The moderate Protestants of La Rochelle were driven into the arms of the more radical. The residents of the city unable to militarily oppose Montpensier's force raised an indemnity of 10,000 livres which persuaded him to leave on 15 November, leaving behind a garrison of 1,200 men. On 27 December citizens of La Rochelle attacked the garrison, seizing gates and towers in such a way as to divide the force in the city. The captains fled La Rochelle, and the remains of the garrison negotiated their withdrawal.\nEmboldened, an agent of La Rochefoucauld's attempted another coup in favour of Condé. On 8 February a small force of outsiders were introduced to La Rochelle and linked up with militant parts of the population. La Rochefoucauld's captain would however become bogged down besieging a gate, allowing the former Protestant mayor to regroup the moderates and scatter the coup plotters. The captain and some of his subordinates were tried and executed for treason on the advice of the lieutenant-general Burie.\n\n\n=== Atlantic islands ===\nOn the Île d'Oléron the citadel of Saint-Pierre was attacked. On the nearby Île de Ré, the Protestants adopted an attitude of neutrality in the conflict. This did save them from being subjected to pillage and depredations by the Catholic commander Monluc and a monk named Richelieu.\n\n\n== Berry ==\n\n\n=== Bourges ===\n\nBourges was brought into the civil war in May, with its church being destroyed in the violence. The city was captured by the Protestants on 27 May. The destruction was led by the troops under the command of the comte de Montgommery. The grave of Louis XII's wife was violated.  As Montgommery's troops entered the city they had taken shots at the scene of the last judgement which was part of the city gates.\n\n\n== Orléanais ==\n\n\n=== Orléans ===\nIn Orléans, radical Protestants burned the preserved heart of the recently deceased king François II. His entrails were thrown to the dogs. Busts of Louis XI and Louis XII that adorned the cities hôtel de ville were destroyed. On 7 August a munitions depot in Orléans exploded, and Montmorency wrote that the situation was becoming dim for the rebel Protestants who were beginning to 'lose hope.\nOne of the most senior Protestant captains, the seigneur de Piennes earned himself a poor reputation among his co-religionists by his conduct in Orléans.\nDuring 1563, after the conduct of morning prayers, the Protestant priests of Orléans would oversee the reinforcing of the cities fortifications.\n\n\n=== Cléry ===\nIn Cléry similar actions against the royal body were undertaken, with the tomb of Louis XI being violated. A copper statue of the king was also decapitated. For some Protestants, Louis XI was a particularly objectionable king.\n\n\n=== Beaugency ===\nCondé decided to strike at Beaugency in July and subjected the city to bombardment. A hole was made in the wall through which the soldiery was able to enter on 3 July. The capture of Beaugency by Protestant forces on was accompanied by a bloody sack of the city. Rapes, murders and pillage followed. Neither Protestant or Catholic households were safe from the rampage of the troops. The Protestant captain La Noue commented that the soldiers had more fury for the civilian population than they did for the garrison of Beaugency.\n\n\n== Bretagne ==\n\nWhile Protestant captains, such as Louis d'Acingé the captain of Tréguier or Christophe du Matz, the captain of the diocese of Nantes, had been begrudgingly tolerated by Étampes in the years before the war, by 1562 the governor of Bretagne felt it necessary to purge them from the ranks. Instead of using the arrière ban to bring to bear a quantity of nobles, he would look instead for more carefully chosen companies to conduct his military efforts. Indeed, during June he expressed to the crown that rather than feudal service he would rather have a paid army at his disposal. During April the baron de Vassé took charge of Laval so that it could not be betrayed to the Protestant rebels. Étampes was aware of disorders in neighbouring Anjou, but wished to ensure that he would not be seen as overstepping his authority by launching campaigns across the provincial borders, and therefore wrote to the king to ask permission to campaign outside his governate. Well aware of the apprehensions of the governor to work across provincial borders, rebel Protestants tried to exploit the border area to avoid suppression, as with a band from Montaigu who crossed the border to sack a Breton church near Clisson. In May Étampes announced that unless there was aggression against Bretagne from a neighbouring province, he would not strike out of the border, by this means he in part sort to appease the Protestants of Bretagne.  In June Montpensier directly appealed for his support, but Étampes would not leave without royal instruction (he was also aware the terms of the arrière ban did not apply to service outside the home province of the noble). Though on a pacific footing, Étampes had assembled a sizable force by this time, boasting around 7,000 men for the repelling of any thrusts by the English.\nWith the successes of the royal army in July the pressure for Étampes to campaign into the interior lessened and indeed he received explicit royal orders in August that his priorities should be to fend off any potential English attacks from the north and maintain the peace in Bretagne. This policy was interrupted by the intrusion of the Protestant army of Montgommery into several parishes of the province around Pontorson. Étampes returned to requesting of the court that he be granted permission to clear the effected border area of Protestants, and was supported in this by the Catholics of Pontorson who requested of him on 12 August that he provide support to ensure the town remained in royal hands. They highlighted if Montgommery captured Pontorson it would both allow for English landings on the mainland, but also enable him to menace Saint-Lô, Caen, Rennes, Dinan, Fougères, Le Mans and Angers.\n\n\n=== Étampes' Normandie campaign ===\nIn August Étampes wrote to the crown to protest that no further taxes be raised. He argued that those already imposed had caused Protestants to begin a new spree of iconoclasm. As a result of the situation in Normandie, Catherine resolves that while the royal army would capture Protestant held Rouen, Étampes would be used for the purpose of restoring order in lower Normandie and rescuing the lieutenant-general Matignon. Before departing on his campaign into Normandie, Étampes needed to be assured of the security of several châteaux and settlements where the Protestant Laval family had influence. He therefore imposed lieutenants with authority over the town and château de Vitre and those of Montfort. Nobles who joined him on the campaign across the border into Normandie would be paid volunteers. Even with pay many nobles remained uninterested and Étampes looked to other men to form his army. As he moved into Normandie he found himself at the head of around 3,500 men. Weak in artillery, he took two pieces on loan from Rennes alongside the arsenal of Lamballe. Aware of his plans the Protestants attempted to seize the arsenal, but without success. On 16 August his force arrived in Fougères, from there he made to Pontorson, securing the town on 26 August to the delight of the Catholics. In front of Ducey, a stronghold of Montgommery on 30 August he put it to siege. A few days later on 2 September he secured Avranches before capturing Vire from Montgommery on 6 September. As he got deeper into Normandie he found himself increasingly facing Protestant skirmishing parties, but he was able to brush them aside with ease. His force was augmented by troops under the command of two of the Lorraine brothers, the duc d'Aumale and the grand prieur. Matignon also offered a small force to his army. The joint presence of the lieutenant-generals of Normandie eased any concerns Étampes might have had about overstepping his prerogatives, he made a great show of deferring to Matignon and involving him in his processes. Over the coming month he moved back and forth over the conquered territories increasingly concerned with his supply situation. Étampes' force arrived in Bayeux around October. Étampes resolves to watch over four strongholds, Bayeux, Saint-Lô, Avranches, and Granville. Greatly concerned by his successes, Condé and Coligny urge Elizabeth to organise an invasion of Bretagne though this would not come to pass. By October's end Étampes resolves to join with the main royal army, and makes his way to join the besieging army in front of Rouen. He ensures that he avoids the governor of Normandie who was held up in Caen on his journey to the siege lines. He would stay with the royal army until the end of the year, his troops distinguishing themselves in front of Paris, his nephew Martigues and the troops fighting at Dreux while Étampes remains with the royal family.\n\n\n=== Nantes ===\nIn April various measures were undertaken to reinforce the city of Nantes. The watch was increased, provisions audited and the cities water gate sealed. The Protestants would at first be allowed to maintain themselves in Nantes in line with the Edict of Saint-Germain. The Cathedral chapter was even unable to prevent the continued sale of Protestant literature.\nIn Nantes, Étampes protested the diverse commands that were being sent out by the royal authorities. He complained that Navarre ordered him to seize the arms of the local Protestants while Montmorency urged him to drive Protestants from the territory. Similar complaints about contradictory orders from the royal centre would be levied by the comte de Lude, the lieutenant-general of Poitou. He further protested the royal suggestions that he fund himself by seizing the treasuries of Catholic held towns, which was argued to him on the grounds that it would prevent neutral Protestants from becoming rebels. He protested that this would be a cause for tumult. Étampes warned that if he was forced to dismiss his men for lack of pay, they would join the rebels as they would 'follow the money'.\nIn July, Étampes held a disputation between several Protestant and Catholic notables at the château de Nantes. As with Poissy this failed to find any unity, however his aim was to show that coexistence was possible, clients of Rohan and Andelot were invited, who may have been tempted to join with their patrons in rebellion. In August Étampes and Martigues had to depart from Nantes to fight rebels in southern Normandie. Recognising things might descend into violence without his presence, Étampes ordered a prohibition of Protestant worship before he left. That month royal orders arrived in Bretagne ordering the removal of all Protestant ministers from the province, these orders were received by the governor of Nantes, Sanzay. The bourgeois of Nantes attempted a purge of suspected Protestants from the présidial court. While many Protestants of Nantes fled to Protestant strongholds such as Blain, some remained and continued to practice in Nantes. Protestantism continued to be tolerated as long as it was in the privacy of ones home and did not involve public non-conformity. With the threat of an English presence on the Loire a captain de La Tour was despatched by the crown to protect Nantes with a request that 300 soldiers be raised for him. Sanzay however preferred to rely on a local militia, and expanded this body to 400 men. He complained to Étampes that La Tour's force was an unnecessary burden on the city. By December he protested that he lacked funds to pay the garrison, the château was devoid of provisions and his orders were increasingly disregarded.\n\n\n=== Guérande, Blain and La Roche-Bernard ===\nIn these towns where Protestant lords held sway, the massacre of Wassy was responded to with the assumption of arms and the strengthening of defences. However this did not precipitate fighting. Blain in particular, a fief of the Rohan family was fortified.\n\n\n=== Dinan ===\nÉtampes was suspicious that the captain of Dinan, Jacques de Forsans was a Protestant, there was therefore a risk that he could betray the town to the Protestants. He could not however dismiss the captain, who enjoyed close relations to the Albret and Navarre families. Therefore, Étampes installed a lieutenant for the town named Jean de Rieux, sieur de Châteauneuf whose authority would supersede the captains. The captain was greatly aggrieved by this usurpation but resigned himself to his situation submitting to Rieux's command of the town.\nThough he had protested his loyalty to Étampes after the appointment of Rieux, a month later when Rieux began to impose himself more fully on Dinan with a review of the nobility he had mobilised, Forsans defected to the Protestant rebels.\n\n\n=== Belle Île ===\nDuring the war, the governor of the island of Belle Île was offered command of the town of Vire by one of the lieutenant-generals of Normandie (the seigneur de Matignon, but declined. He justified his refusal by his fear that if something were to happen in his governate in his absence he would find himself in trouble.\n\n\n=== Brest ===\nA captain of 100 soldiers in the city of Brest was found to be absent from his charge, Étampes therefore had them replaced by the captain of the city, Jérôme de Carné.\n\n\n== Île de France ==\n\n\n=== Paris ===\n\nDuring the war Paris would be entrusted first to the lieutenant-generalcy of the comte de Brissac in May, before being transferred to his brother, the seigneur de Gonnor a few months later. Both men worked to protect the capital against threats, and acted as intermediaries between the royal family and the administration of the city.\nIn May there was a scare that the Protestants were about to stage an attack on the capital, however it turned out to be a simple quarrel between some boatmen. Nevertheless, the Parisians had already chained the street in preparation for the attacks. On 28 May the cardinals de Guise and de Lorraine carried the Ciborium aloft in a procession through the city, every corner crowded with soldiers from Metz and Calais. Due to the fact the king had departed Paris, the remaining Protestants in the city were ordered to depart by Navarre within 48 hours on 26 May. He declared that their property was forfeit, which was met with delight in the capital. Those who chose to stay to protect their property or because they couldn't leave were ordered to convert or leave immediately. The rebaptism of a Protestant girl into the Catholic faith was attended by 10,000 Parisians. Book burnings were undertaken at the place Maubert, and the Catholic population enjoyed firebrand preaching from the cardinal de Lorraine. Lorraine chose a sermon which affirmed the real presence while the Papal nuncio stood by. Processions against heresy were undertaken. In June, the Paris parlement undertook to receive confessions of Catholic faith from all its judges. 31 of the courts 143 members chose to absent themselves on the day that the public declaration of their Catholicism was to be made. While this does mean all 31 were necessarily Protestant, it was a not insignificant minority of the courts membership. Even among those who did not absent themselves, there were those who were suspected of Protestant sympathies, such as Christophe de Harlay. The université de Paris followed on from the example of the parlement in requiring oaths of Catholicism. After an incautiously worded declaration from the Paris parlement, vigilante killings began in July. Suspected Protestants were given mock trials and killed, or struck down in the street. For example, during the procession on the feast of the holy-innocents, an observer who made an incautious comment was murdered by those around them. The parlement revoked its edict and insisted on the following of regular legal channels. Houses that were not draped in tapestries were subject to looting.\nThe violence was in part motivated by developments around Paris. When nearby Meaux was seized by the Protestants, fuelling paranoia that the cities food supply would be cut off. Measures were taken to ease potential food shortages. It was now ordered that even Protestants who had converted to Catholicism were to leave the city, searches were undertaken for arms. The prisons of Paris filled with religious prisoners, so much so that they could not be fed and began to starve in the petit châtelet. Some arrests were undertaken solely to protect individuals from the wrath of crowds.\nOn 28 January a gunpowder store detonated in the arsenal. It caused significant damage to the surrounding houses, and as a crowd gathered to look at the damage word spread that the explosion had been set off by the Protestants. Before the arrival of Marshal Montmorency the crowd had killed at least one. Another several would be killed the following day.\n\n\n== Provence ==\n\nIn Provence, the governor the comte de Tende was not openly Protestant, but was at least sympathetic to Protestantism. His second son the comte de Cipierre and second wife Françoise de Foix-Candalle were both openly Protestant. In opposition to the governor and the comte de Crussol, the seigneur de Flassans who had been pushed out of Aix destroyed a royal company and pillaged the countryside around the city.  In early March Tende was able to defeat Flassans' forces, that had terrorised the Protestants of Provence during 1561. Flassans was driven out of Provence by a combined army of Tende and Mauvans. Flassans defeat came despite the 500 reinforcements he had received. Tende, Mauvans and Crussol sacked the Flassans stronghold of Barjols on 6 March. Tende did not approve of the massacre that followed, and entrusted his son in law Jacques de Cardé with stopping the violence. Flassans himself was able to escape the slaughter of his men. He fled to the Île de Porquerolles.  In the wake of the massacre of Barjols, Crussol's commission was challenged at the court on the grounds of his Protestant sympathies.\n\nAfter the defeat of Flassans, Flassans' brother, the comte de Carcès recruited Tende's eldest son who had remained Catholic to the radical cause. Therefore, in May his eldest son, the lieutenant-general of Provence, the seigneur de Sommerive declared himself in rebellion against his father. He wrote a letter to his father announcing this decision as his 'very humble, very obedient, and very sorry son and servant'. Sommerive secured the rallying of the majority of the important city governors of Provence in opposition to the comte de Tende. Tende had raised levies, but was soon forced to disband them due to his inability to pay them. The disbanded troops spread out as gangs attacking Protestants across Provence. Tende wrote mournfully to Catherine bemoaning how divided the province was. In Aix, the Protestant members of the garrison disrupted a Catholic procession by throwing grains into the path it was to take, causing injury to the bare footed pilgrims. Tende was unable to prevent the Catholic counterstroke, which was to massacre the Protestants of the city, even when he appealed to the parlement in the city. Six of those parlementaires who had supported the registration of the edict of Saint-Germain fled the city, while the seventh was murdered. The parlement chose to recognise Sommerive as the governor of the province. Sommerive declared the arrière ban, raised taxes and announced that his father was a captive of the Protestants, making his orders null. Both Aix and Marseille fell under his control, and he received troops from the Papal States. Catholic successes began in Provence earlier than they did in the rest of the south. Thus it was on 6 June that Orange was recaptured from the Protestants by a combined force of Carcès in alliance with the Papal commander Fabrizzio Serbelloni. The capture was accompanied by a bloody series of reprisals. Naked corpses of raped women were hanged from trees, and pages of the gospel were stuffed into the mouths of the dead. The violence was largely undertaken irrespective of religion, the Papal army butchering both Catholics and Protestants. In response to this coup, having been informed by Provençal Protestants of the Papal brutality, the baron des Adrets invaded the Papal States in July. Alongside Carcės, Sommerive then proceeded to drive Tende from the province, forcing him into exile in Savoia. The Protestants would take refuge in Sisteron during September. When put to siege by the Catholic forces, the comte de Cipierre would face off against his elder brother Somerive. Sisteron fell to the Catholic forces that same month. Its fall would see brutal reprisals carried out against those inside the town including further instances of sexual violence.\n\n\n=== Aix ===\nBy July some of the consuls that had been purged by the commissioners were reinstated to their charges. This process was completed in September, with Flassans returning to his office.\n\n\n=== Mornas ===\nAfter the Protestant capture of Mornas by a force under the command of Montbrun on 8 July, the defenders of the city would be massacred, their corpses put into the river with a sign which urged the people of Avignon to let the corpses pass as they had 'paid the toll' of Mornas.\n\n\n=== Noves and Saint-Rémy ===\nCrussol's troops in Provence which were stationed at Noves and Saint-Rémy were accused of mistreating the towns priests and elements of the population. Crussol responded to reports of this behaviour by ordering his captain at Saint-Rémy to respect the people of the town.\n\n\n== Guyenne ==\n\nIn Guyenne, Condé entrusted the seigneur de Duras as his deputy. Initially the wave of Protestant urban seizures completely overwhelmed the Catholic commander Monluc. He marched towards Montauban only for it to defect to the Protestants, he then heard that Agen was also with the rebels. He moved then towards Villeneuve d'Agen and Port-Sainte-Marie, finding similar situations in both. Monluc, a man of pitched battles, had to adapt to the new style of warfare by urban coup. Only Bordeaux stood for the king in Guyenne.\n\n\n=== Monluc's campaigns ===\nIn April 1562, the Catholic commander and future Marshal of France Blaise de Monluc took Villefranche at the request of Cardinal d'Armagnac, by this means Catholic worship was re-established in the cities churches. Viewing the local authorities as insufficiently harsh he intervened to have several hanged from the town hall windows. In the summer of 1562, Monluc began a campaign against the queen of Navarre in southern France. Unlike the royal court, he recognised the danger of the Albret dynasty with their deep ties and connections in the south.\nNavarre had learned of the iconoclasm that had transpired during his wife's stay in Vendôme on 21 May and was furious. His immediate plan was for Charles to have her lands handed over to him and for her to be sentenced to life imprisonment. Having established herself in Pau a secretary was despatched south to her by Navarre. Navarre was aware Felipe would want the annexation of Navarre to be accomplished legally. This secretary brought with him a procuration allowing Navarre to trade her rights to the kingdom of Navarre for a new kingdom Navarre was to gain from the Spanish in Sardinia. Navarre was informed of the great wealth of Sardinia, abundant in pasture and cities. With royalist troops in Guyenne, and the Spanish to her back, the queen of Navarre signed, though included a secret disclaimed allowing her to re-open the discussion at a later date. The declaration would never be delivered to the king of Navarre prior to his death regardless. The king of Navarre meanwhile instructed Monluc to see to his wife's capture, but Monluc was unable to intercept her before she reached her seigneurial lands in Béarn.\nMonluc developed a reputation for brutality. Protestant pastors and laymen were summarily executed under his orders either by being hanged or thrown into wells. The commander bemoaned that the poor state of his soldiers pay forced him to ransom prisoners as opposed to executing them all. For Monluc the brutality was a necessary part of warfare given the risks that faced royal authority in times of rebellion.\nMonluc aided in the preservation of Toulouse and Bordeaux for the royalist cause. As concerned Toulouse he had been able to prevent Protestant reinforcements under the seigneur de Lanta and Arpajon from making it to the city. He had hurried to Bordeaux in early June to provide support for the seigneur de Burie who was having difficulty holding the city. On route to Bordeaux he was told by a representative of the queen of Navarre's that the situation in the city was fine, and that she had left France to her sovereign lands to cool tensions. This left Monluc in a difficult position, unsure whether the court would approve of an aggressive attitude towards the queen's territories. On 3 July he captured Castelvieux with the support of Spanish forces who would be a continual asset to him during his campaign. In August he took Monségur and had the garrison executed, including a captain he had served with in the Italian Wars. He also captured Penne during this month. This was followed with the capture of Terraube in September during which a general slaughter of the population was undertaken, the bodies thrown into the well. On 9 September, Réalville fell to him. Monluc then recaptured Bergerac, Sainte-Foy and Lectoure (2 October), which had been taken by the Protestants. His conquests were accompanied by hundreds of deaths. In Bordeaux, he installed his protégé Tilladet who took charge of the town's Catholic league (which dated back to 1560) and allied with a league under the comte de Candalle later during the war.\n\nMonluc was kept from invading Navarre's sovereign lands by Catherine, on the understanding that the queen of Navarre would maintain a technical neutrality in the conflict. From his base at Agen, Monluc therefore focused his attentions in the south against local Protestant forces. The local Protestant commander Duras who commanded around 4,000 soldiers was advised by the queen of Navarre to retire to Orléans. Though she framed this in correspondence with Catherine as evidence of her desire for peace, it conformed with the rebel strategy for forces to be concentrated at Orléans. Duras ignored the advise to proceed to Orléans and instead made an assault on Bordeaux which failed. After this he decided to hunker down at Montauban, the final major city held by the Protestants in Guyenne with his consolidated force of around 8,000 men. Catherine was not idle however, and re-installed Monluc and the local sénéchaux with military authority over the Albret lands of Armagnac and Foix. The queen of Navarre's bishops were warned they would forfeit their office if they did not return to Catholicism.\nThe presence of Spanish forces in Pamplona and Fuenterrabia served to dissuade another Protestant commander, the seigneur de Grammont, who headed Gascon infantry from proceeding north to join with Condé.\nWith orders to rendezvous with Condé, Duras began to make the way north. Monluc first fought the Protestants in a battle from 5–8 October on the Dordogne with the support of a Spanish contingent under don Carbajal. On 9 October Monluc intercepted the Protestant army of Duras at the Battle of Vergt in the Périgord and came out the victor. Duras lost about 1,400 men in the battle and his army was prevented from unifying with the main Protestant force. Thompson attributes the Protestant defeat at the battle of Dreux to the battle of Vergt. La Rochefoucauld took the battered remnants of Duras' force north to Orléans. After his departure from towns in the Périgord Monluc endeavoured to leave in his wake leagues of gentleman to assume military control and protect against any counter-attack.\nThough the defeat of Duras left him uncontested in Guyenne, Monluc recognised that there was the potential for the conflict to be rekindled through outside encouragement, which he primarily saw as emanating from the queen of Navarre. He was keen to invade her sovereign lands to assure himself of victory but her technical neutrality prevented this therefore he re-established himself at Agen where he could maintain a watch over the south.  Monluc was established as the lieutenant-general of Guyenne in December for his victory at Vergt, dividing the great province with the seigneur de Burie. Monluc was given authority over Bordeaux and Agen, while Burie maintained authority over the territories to the east of the river Lot.\nAll was not militarily settled in Guyenne however. His appointment was a temporary one until such time as the young prince de Béarn should reach adulthood. Monluc's hegemony over Guyenne was then challenged militarily. The Protestant captain Armand de Clermont seized first Mussidan in January 1563 and then reconquered Bergerac for the Protestant cause in March of that year. The queen of Navarre meanwhile looked to the seigneur d'Audaux to lead her military efforts.\n\n\n=== Bordeaux ===\nThe Protestants failed to bring Bordeaux into their fold. In Bordeaux, it was the seigneur de Burie who was tasked by the secrétaire d'État de Fresne to rally the local nobility, protect Bordeaux and prevent local Protestants from reinforcing Condé.\nIn May the parlementaires undertook an investigation of the premier présidents residence on suspicion there were arms stored there, however none were found.\nOn 26 June a Protestant force attempted to conquer the château de Trompette on the north east of the curtain wall system of Bordeaux. The château-Trompette was one of the two major fortifications that protected Bordeaux, the other being the château du Hâ which faced westwards. The seigneurs de Duras, Pardaillan and Langoiran led the effort. They enjoyed the support of several of Burie's men who assured them the gates would be opened for them. As the captain of the château had recently married into the Pardaillan family, the attackers felt assured in his neutrality to their efforts, if not support. However the captain remained firm and the gates remained locked to the attackers, foiling their scheme.\nThere was a further disturbance in the parish of Saint-Rémy which Burie was forced to send his personal military force to suppress.\nIn the wake of these episodes, the Catholics on the parlement urged all officials to take an oath of their Catholicism. The parlements Catholic syndicate patrolled the streets at night. The Catholic governor of Bordeaux ordered a tax be imposed on the Protestants of the city to support three hundred Catholic soldiers. Burie objected arguing that all should contribute, and while this was conceded to, the Catholics would pay a lower sum and not be subject to the troops lodging in their houses.\nBy late July Burie had conceded to the existence of a syndicate, though he informed Monluc its only responsibility would be guarding the walls. Lagebâton, the premier président did not concede so easily and succeeded in bringing a majority of the parlement in opposing its formation a week later. Though the Catholic hardliners threatened to appeal to the crown, this threat was defused, and Burie brought on board for the abolition of the syndicate.\nIn December, the comte de Candalle came before the parlement of Bordeaux, and made an appeal for the Catholics of the region to arm themselves and dispel the Protestants who would otherwise bring about the ruin of Catholicism.\nAt the probably encouragement of Monluc, the seigneur de Merville, governor of Bordeaux established a league for the sénéchausée of Guyenne. It was modelled on similar organisations established by the Protestants, with a multi-layered structure.\n\n\n=== Conserans ===\nThe bishop of Conserans Hector d'Aussan raised a company of arquebusiers to defend his city from Protestant attacks. He led 4,000 men out of his city to confront a Protestant force during 1562. Protestants were unable to establish themselves in his diocese.\n\n\n=== Agenais ===\nAcross the rest of the Agenais, Lectoure, Tonneins, Villeneuve and Nérac were conquered variously by the seigneur de Duras or the vicomte de Caumont. Condom resisted this Protestant tide, its lieutenant-sénéchal having armed the Catholic elite.\nMonluc and Burie were both ordered to move their forces quickly to Bordeaux, however Monluc was petitioned by the nobility of the Agenais in May to not abandon them and he agreed to take them up on their request. Monluc informed the king of his intentions and then formed a military council and established six new commissions for military command beneath his authority. His forces assembled at Faudoas on 22 May.\n\n\n=== Agen ===\nOn 17 April a Protestant force surprised Agen, with the gate being opened to them during the night. The leading militant Catholics of the city were all arrested, though one managed to escape to a nearby château. Seventeen churches and the cathedral were sacked and then usurped. Catholic worship was prohibited.\nThe recapture of Agen was accomplished by Monluc with little resistance in August, freeing the cities radical Catholics. Monluc established Lalande as commander of the city and ordered the arrest of 1,000 Protestants over the coming months. Roughly 500 of the arrested would be hanged between the recapture of the city and the end of the war. By January 1563 the jurade of Agen had declared that all Protestant goods might be sold for the fortification of the city. The crown declared that all religious prisoners were to be freed if the Protestant military commanders put down their arms and came to negotiate with the royalists. This aroused the fury of the Catholic establishment in Agen through its failure to differentiate Catholics from Protestants. The jurade voted to bypass the crown and allow the confiscation of Protestant property.\n\n\n== Auvergne ==\n\n\n=== Le Puy ===\nThe Protestants of the Velay launched an attack on Le Puy. This was combined with an uprising inside the city, comprising around a 1/3 of the population of the city. The bishop of Le Puy, Antoine de Sennetaire was forced to flee from his diocese.\n\n\n== Languedoc ==\n\nIn Languedoc, Condé entrusted the sieur de Beaudiné as his lieutenant in the province. De Bèze had written to the province asking them to send men and arms for to protect the king his brothers, Catherine and the princes on 16 March. In Bas-Languedoc Nîmes, Saint-Gilles, Montpellier, Orange, Beaucaire, Béziers and Agde all expel the Catholic religion from their confines and embrace the Protestant rebellion. Meanwhile, in Haut-Languedoc, Montauban, Castres, Caussade, Réalville, Millau, Puylaurens, Saint-Antonin, Rabastens and Gaillac all defected. In the Cévannes and Vivarais, Aubenas, Privas, Annonay, Largentière, Tournon and Bourg-Saint-Andéol allied themselves with Condé's cause.\n\n\n=== Crussol, Protestant governor of Languedoc ===\n\nCrussol headed to Languedoc after defeating Flassans in Provence in early March arriving in the province in April. His efforts in the province were inhibited by the beginning of the civil war. He would soon be recalled to court by Catherine, the situation collapsing in his absence.\nHaving visited Orléans, Crussol retired to neutrality from the conflict on his estates. This was despite several appeals he received urging him to take the lead of the Languedoc Protestant cause. A number of consistories dispatched delegations to him through August to October urging him to follow this course of action without effect. Finally an appeal in November by the Estates assembled in Nîmes succeeded in rousing him to action. It chastised Crussol in intense language for allowing Protestant blood to be spilled, and urged him to show his loyalty to the king by championing the 'oppressed Protestants' of Languedoc and protecting them from 'foreign invasion'. Crussol responded that he would take up the cause due to his aspirations to see the king's subjects maintained in love for him, ensuring they were protected from foreigners. Crussol wrote to Catherine justifying his decision, highlighting the abuses of royal power that were being suffered. He did not frame himself as a defender of Protestantism, but rather royal authority. Nicoll highlights several further reasons for his decision to join the Protestant cause: a desire to protect his lands from attacks by Catholic nobles such as Saint-Vidal and prevent the damage to his honour by the assaults on his subjects.\nThe provincial Protestant estates assembled at the Crussol estates of Uzès on 11 November and declared that the comte de Crussol would be their governor of Languedoc. The nobility of the Vivarais and urban delegates from Uzès, Montpellier, Nîmes, Alès, Viviers, Beaucaire, Florac, Pont-Saint-Esprit, Bagnols, Béziers, Les Vans, Mende, Castres and Agde were party to the agreement. Beneath him would be a council of ten elected members, chosen by the Estates. Crussol would have the right to name subordinate governors, but only after they had been subject to the scrutiny of the Estates. He selected his brother Galiot de Crussol as his lieutenant-general and chose subordinate governors who were subsequently sent out to receive entries to their various charges. He selected his other brother the sieur de Beaudiné as the governor of Nîmes. The seigneur de Cournonterral was made lieutenant-general of the Vivarais while the baron de Peyre was made governor of the Gévaudan. Béziers and Bagnols also received new governors. Those he appointed needed approval of their Christian values from the Protestant church. The estates swore they would serve him with every drop of their blood. They offered him a subsidy of 400,000 livres to raise an army. Crussol for his part promised to protect Protestantism, and not tolerate Catholicism among his followers.\nCrussol and the council beneath him engaged with the more local Protestant estates to ensure soldiers were paid and fed. For example, Cournonterral who he had established over the Vivarais participated in the local estates at Rochemaure. The body was requested to provide pay and munitions, and acceded to both requests. Money was raised through the seizure of Catholic assets, confiscation of Catholic and royal revenues, fundraising from the Protestant churches (over 300,000 livres was requested) and loans.\nCrussol often served as the middleman between his military commanders across the province and the council. In more international plans the estates at Nîmes declared that they would establish a navy for the security of the province and work on improvements to the fortifications on the frontier specified by Crussol.\nCrussol gained the right of authority over the Protestant church akin to that granted to the crown by the edict of Saint-Germain, with no synods to occur without either one of his officers or himself present. For the Catholics, it was felt preferable that they be exiled from the province rather than made to 'hypocritically convert'. The assembly of Rochemaure established a confession of faith all inhabitants were to uphold in November.\nThe assembly also took up the matter of those who affiliated with Protestantism out of a belief that they would no longer have to pay seigneurial dues and taxes. The assembly declared such people were 'libertines' who needed to be combatted with 'good justice' so that such seditions did not continue to spread. This did not mean the assembly was opposed to the people engaging in resistance however, and it was recognised that Protestantism was under attack and that all Protestants were therefore compelled to take up arms for their defence.\nIn December, Catherine wrote to Crussol, chastising him for taking up arms against the crown. She urged him to not forget the good favour she had shown him and capitulate for the Languedoc Protestants in a negotiated peace to the lieutenant-general of Languedoc Joyeuse. By this means she stated the Protestants could enjoy liberty of conscience.\nThrough January and February Crussol undertook the establishing of commissions in the hope of raising a new military force. It was alleged that this new force numbered around 6,000 men. Coligny boasted to Elizabeth that Crussol had almost succeeded in saving the entirety of Languedoc from tyranny.\nA further meeting was undertaken at Bagnols from 31 March to 5 April 1563 with 25 nobles and 31 members of the Third Estate. The assembly had been planned for Montpellier but Crussol was on campaign in the Comtat Venaissin and therefore it had to be moved. While Crussol had received an unsigned version of the edict of Amboise that established peace, confirmation that peace had been established was not confirmed until after the assembly. Crussol himself was kept appraised of the assemblies progress. Therefore, this shadow administration was provisional in nature, predicated on the king being a minor. It was established by the assembly that no peace could be established until such time Languedoc was granted a Protestant governor and judicial system. The king was viewed as still potentially being in captivity. Several nobles were dispatched to court to remonstrate with the king on the matter of the peace. The alliance of the Protestant assemblies of Dauphiné, Languedoc and the Lyonnais under the 'protection of Crussol' was re-confirmed. The assembly bemoaned the paucity of funds for troops as many had been sent to Dauphiné, Nicoll hypothesises these were devoted to relief of the siege of Grenoble. Collected revenues were lower than had been projected, due to royalist control of some of the areas that were to be raised from, or alternatively protests that the country was now at peace. Money was advanced by the council to pay for German mercenaries from Lyon at considerable expense. Therefore, warnings were sent out urging towns and villages send money to the council or face Crussol's wrath. It was agreed there would be no further monetary impositions on Languedoc due to the poverty of the province, focusing on continued liquidation of Catholic church land and export duties. Crussol was urged by the assembly to see to the punishment of delinquent soldiers, through the publishing of military ordonnances. Attendance of mass was also felt to be a crime that needed a firmer hand.\n\n\n=== Nîmes ===\nThe first exposure of Nîmes to the civil war that was to engulf France was when in late February a small Protestant force passed through the city and engaged in iconoclasm as they passed. On 18 March the judge Robert LeBlanc of the présidial court brought a message from Condé, Coligny and the comte de Crussol. He urged the Protestant consistory to remain peaceable, but to arm themselves if the Catholics armed themselves. By April the Catholic canons again departed Nîmes and Protestants began celebrating services inside the city again in defiance of the edict of Saint-Germain. The church bells were ordered melted down on 19 May and the Catholic silverware was sold off. The money was used to support Protestant troops.\nIn December, the new governor the Protestant sieur de Beaudiné staged his triumphant entry into Nîmes, the consuls lodged him in the abandoned bishops palace.\n\n\n=== Carcassonne ===\nIn March, the Catholics of Carcassonne waited for the Protestants of their city to depart from the walls for their service, before locking the gates, and refusing them re-entry. This was despite the pleading of the Catholic relatives of the exiled Protestants inside the walls.\nThe estates of Languedoc met in December in Carcassonne. There was great fear among the royalist Catholic leadership that Duras and Crussol would hijack the estates. It was agreed among the radical Catholic grandees that Monluc would guard Toulouse in case the Protestants tried to use the estates as a distraction to attack the city. The estates proved firmly Catholic, demanding 300,000 livres towards the reclaiming of lost Catholic territories which would be raised through the seizure of Protestant property, a tax on Protestants in Toulouse and fines on those who failed to attend mass. The Carcassonne estates highlighted that they had met at royal instruction, and denounced the illegitimate assembly that had gathered at Nîmes under the guise of a meeting of the estates. All its rulings were declared to be void by the Carcassonne estates.\n\n\n=== Montauban ===\nThe vicomte d'Arpajon was dispatched by Condé to raise troops in Montauban for the Protestant rebels, and he arrived during April. Monluc, alerted to what was going on, made towards Montauban to prevent his arrival. Alarmed, Protestant delegates of Montauban attempted to secure the support of their Toulousian co-religionists in their defence. Companies belonging to Monluc, the comte de Nègrepelisse, and the comte de Terride, alongside local gentleman from Toulouse and urban citizens of the surrounding area came to aid in Monluc's siege. Though there had been around 2,000 armed men when Monluc departed from Toulouse, by the time he arrived in front of Montauban on 20 May desertions had reduced his force to about 900, many of his men having been only interested in the 'defence of Toulouse' with little desire to be involved in a broader campaign. The consuls of Montauban had not however been idle, and their work on the defences of the city had left it one of the strongest defended places in France. Thus Montauban resisted Monluc's siege in May, Monluc struggling to keep his force in the field for more than a few weeks.\nIn September, the comte de Terride attempted his own siege of Montauban, but with a similar lack of success due to much the same issues as had plagued the first siege. He made another attempt from October to April to reduce the city, this time under the leadership of the lieutenant-general the cardinal d'Armagnac. Monluc was invited to participate, but only briefly visited the siege lines, before returning to Guyenne. Armagnac brought with him a new method of financing the siege so that it might last longer, a treasury supported from Toulouse. Toulousian parlementaires visited the siege lines so they could gauge the progress of the reduction efforts in December and Toulousian captains dominated the undertaking of the siege from November onwards, where prior it had been led by Gascon captains. The bourgeois of the city involved themselves in the provision of powder and carts of ammunition. Inside Montauban was a garrison of 2,000 soldiers under the command of the governor of Montauban, Nicolas Rapin. The Protestant minister of Montauban was also heavily involved in the defence of the city. He was experienced in fighting, having involved himself in the Savoyard Waldensian War of 1561 fighting against the duca di Savoia. Initially this garrison outnumbered the besiegers heavily, however the besiegers eventually brought to bear 1,500 infantrymen with support from mounted arquebusiers and ten pieces of artillery. Forts were occupied and constructed in the surrounding area in the hope of controlling access to Montauban, though they lacked control of the west of the city. On 17 October, the besieging force attempted to enter negotiations with the defenders, hoping to convince them to cease their resistance. For the besieged, the captain Laboria and the Protestant ministers participated, the latter strongly urging Laboria against any compromise or negotiation. Laboria presented a firm position to the besiegers that they were loyally defending the king's edicts. As October dragged on Laboria began to believe a negotiated peace was in the cities best interest, but he was rebuked in this course by 7 of the 8 ministers of the city. A further parlay on 28 October saw a similarly resolute determination from the minister who accompanied Laboria. The ministers were alarmed at Laboria's attitude in this period and urged the council of Montauban to move against him. A reconciliation was brokered between Laboria and the ministers in which the governor agreed to continue to resist, however shortly thereafter he slipped out of the city. The baron d'Ambres successfully resupplied Montauban for the Protestants in late 1562. Armagnac was still besieging the city when word of the general peace arrived, and he informed the leaders of Montauban that he would withdraw his forces if the city submitted to the crown. As such, ultimately the siege, like the previous efforts would prove a failure.\n\n\n=== Toulouse ===\n\nToulouse was the seat of a parlement, and the local administration was strongly divided between the parlement which favoured persecution, and the urban government of the capitouls which had favoured the tolerant policy of the crown. The Toulousian parlement would later gain the reputation of being the \"bloodiest tribunal in France\" for its militant opposition to Protestantism. The capitouls were elected yearly from each of the eight' capitoulates of Toulouse and were in Greengrass' estimation the most important office in Languedoc. The local Protestants saw optimistic prospects for a coup, as they had a strong minority population in the city, and in 1561 had enjoyed the fact that at least three of the four capitouls were Protestants while a fourth was sympathetic to the faith. The 1562 capitouls were less Protestant, with only two in the faith, while Greengrass argues another two may have begun to sympathise with the Protestants.\nOn 3 February the two sides met to resolve their differences. The capitouls protested the usurpation of their prerogatives over policing and security in the city by the judicial body. The parlementaires countered by highlighting the growing number of armed Protestant services required a greater policing presence. When the capitouls attempted to rebut this, several militant Catholic departed from the meeting, presenting the chair with an already signed remonstrance against the capitouls they had prepared days earlier. Soon thereafter a report was presented to the parlement illustrating how several capitouls had been attending an illegal Protestant service.\nDuring Lent one of the guards assigned to protect the Protestants as they went to their worship outside Toulouse accidentally shot a Protestant in the head. On 2 April Catholics attempted to seize a body that was to be buried according to Protestant rites. The confrontation became violent, and required the intervention of the city guard. Several Protestants were killed in the riot. In the evening frustrated Protestants attempted to take the hôtel de ville but the crisis was defused with concessions to both sides. The Protestants would be allowed to maintain a guard of 200 (unarmed) men, and the Catholics a similar number led by four captains. The Catholic captains refused to allow themselves to be subordinated to the capitouls or to participate in house searches of Catholics. By the terms of the agreement all armed forces not above mentioned were to depart from the city, and the Catholics were further prohibited from ringing the tocsin. On 11 April the parlement had the condemned Catholics pardoned for their roles in the violence.\nDuring April a colloquy was held by the Protestants, at which it was agreed not to join Condé's association. This greatly disheartened the delegates from Montauban, who were only reassured that if Montauban was attacked they would come to the cities aid. Nevertheless, money would be sent to Condé in response to the appeal to the city from de Bèze. Covertly Protestant troops were also secreted into the city. In May the parlement declared the ban-et-arrière ban (noble military service) much to the indignation of the capitouls who objected to the assembling of soldiers in the city without their consent. On 10 May 200 Catholic nobles entered Toulouse under arms. These soldiers were not subject to the cities municipal authority. A Protestant noble and capitoul of Toulouse, Pierre Hunault, the seigneur de Lanta, met with Condé in Orléans and promised him that Toulouse would be delivered to the Protestant rebels. The plan was to make copies of the keys and then seize the city with a combination of troops raised in the city and external forces from Lanta's estates in the Lauragais. However the plot was revealed to the parlement of Toulouse by Guise and Monluc and the city was thus put on alert. At a secret meeting it was agreed to advance the timetable of the coup as they already had troops in the city.\nThe Protestant rebels succeeded in seizing the hôtel de ville (in which three of the capitouls were present) and the colleges of Saint-Martial, Saint-Catherine and Périgord on the night of 11 May. Before dawn they assembled barricades of earth filled barrels in the quarters they had been able to secure. They were confronted by the parlementaires and Catholic citizens of Toulouse. The militant parlementaires were fairly easily able to convince their colleagues of the wisdom of their policy, and turned their chamber into a barracks and established an operations room led by several parlementaires. The parlementaires summoned Monluc, the baron de Terride, the comte de Nègrepelisse and the sénéchal of Toulouse Bellegarde to their aid. Monluc and Bellegarde made to attack a relief army while Nègrepelisse and Terride hurried to Toulouse, deploying their troops in the city. Four days of savage street fighting followed. The Catholics enjoyed the weight of numbers, with around 3–5,000 active fighters in comparison with 2,000 Protestant. The Protestants were however better armed due to the weapons they had smuggled in and the military supplies in the hôtel de ville. The Protestants attempted to employ cannons at several locations, however it was to limited effect. The fighting not only occurred above ground but also below, with Protestants in the sewers being flushed out into the Garonne. Both sides employed innovative guerrilla tactics for their advantage. On 15 May the Catholic forces in the city set an entire district of 200 houses ablaze. Four defensive wheeled wooden vehicles were deployed on this day to shield them from Protestant firepower. The Catholic preachers urged their flock to kill, promising them that they did it under the authority of their fathers. On the morning of the Saturday a truce was negotiated by which the remaining Protestants would be allowed to depart the city before the end of Sunday, no guarantee was given to their property or worship. It was an alliance of the common people and conseillers that maintained Toulouse for the royalist cause. The victorious Catholics quickly set about purging the administration of Toulouse of all Protestants. The majority of the surviving Protestants were allowed to depart Toulouse, however as they did they were harried by bands of peasants, and in the end more were killed beyond Toulouse's walls than inside. In total around 3000-4000 citizens of Toulouse were killed in the fight for the city. Breaking this down, a contemporary estimated around 200 Protestants died in the street fighting, in comparison with around 100 Catholics. Greengrass considers these figures too low. Around 200 or more Protestants would be hanged in effigy after the defeat. After the successful preservation of the city at minimum 120 were subject to execution, including one of the capitouls Adhémar Mandinelli who had his severed head nailed to the entrance to the hôtel de ville. His property was also forfeit. Those capitouls who had fled were subject to a 100,000 livres fine, eternal banishment from Toulouse and being hanged in effigy.\nA Protestant company had been making its way from Montauban to support their co-religionists in the acquisition of Toulouse, however when it became apparent Terride and Charry's company were in the area, they retreated back to Montauban. In the wake of the attempted coup in Toulouse and its bloody suppression, hostilities erupted between royalists and Protestant rebels in Castres, Gaillac, Albi and the Comminges.\nDuring the summer, the cardinal d'Armagnac arrived in Toulouse, where he had recently been made archbishop, and assumed the military powers of the lieutenant-generalcy of the sénéchaussée of Toulouse. In October, Armagnac wrote to the crown requesting the dispatch of reinforcements, highlighting that Toulouse might soon be attacked. The crown responded by asking Armagnac to enforce its recent truce proposal to de-escalate confessional tensions, with all the Protestants jailed in Toulouse to be freed. The Catholic leaders of Toulouse reacted with horror to this proposal, seeing it as 'madness' to allow 'defeated Protestant soldiers to be reunited with their compatriots in the field'. A request for exemption from the amnesty was refused.\nMonluc arrived in Toulouse in December and worked towards the furtherance of Catholic military ascendency in the city, meanwhile elections were held for a new premier président of the parlement and the office of sénéchal. Bellegarde was re-elected over the sieur de Merville as sénéchal due to his role in aiding the crushing of the May uprising and his greater experience. In February 1563 Monluc and Armagnac oversaw the induction of Nègrepelisse and the seigneur de Forquevaux into the Ordre de Saint-Michel (Order of Saint-Michel) at the Cathedral of Toulouse. That same month the parlement successfully gained permission to seize property from the Protestants who had 'caused unrest'. By this time, several of the capitouls who had fled after the May uprising had been reinstated by the crown. One of the restored capitouls attempted to filibuster Armagnac's new plan for the guard, but the parlement ordered Catholic troops to seize the keys to the gates from the hôtel de ville in March.\n\n\n=== Puylaurens ===\nAfter Crussol assumed military leadership of the rebel Protestant cause in Languedoc he ordered an attack on Puylaurens which was in royalist hands. The town was thus captured. Bourg-Saint-Andéol, Aramon and Bédarieux were also captured towards the end of 1562.\n\n\n=== Lavaur ===\nLavaur was attacked by a Protestant force that had sortied from Montauban. According to Monluc, the Protestants pillaged Lavaur and established themselves in the city, receiving those who had fled from Toulouse.\n\n\n=== Castres ===\nA Protestant conspiracy was devised in Castres to secure the city. Secret discussions were undertaken for the capture with gentleman both within and without Castres walls to seize the city when word came from Crussol. Crussol gave his approval for the seizure of Castres and imprisonment of Catholic hostages. The coup caught the Catholics entirely off guard and the cathedral was burned.\nThe Protestant commander in Castres, the sieur de Ferrières oversaw the capture of Roquecourbe and settlements in the Montagne Noire.\nAs late as 2 April, Protestant soldiers from Castres undertook a sortie alongside troops from Puylaurens that saw the capture of Buzet which afforded access to the capital of Quercy.\n\n\n=== Annonay ===\nThe Protestants seized control of Annonay during the summer. In October the royalist commander Saint-Chamond recaptured the town, putting it to a sack during the recapture. A Protestant assembly at Baix that same month resolved on the importance of recapturing Annonay and to this end Crussol's lieutenant-general for the Vivarais, Saint-Martin was given a commission in December. Saint-Martin brought Annonay back into the rebel Protestant fold and oversaw the repairing of the walls and fortification of the gate. Nemours ordered Saint-Chamond to capture the town again, and he returned with a sizable force during Saint-Martin's absence towards the start of January, completely destroying the walls and gate. The town would remain in royalist hands going forward.\n\n\n=== Montpellier ===\n\nIn Montpellier the cathedral and bishops palaces were burned. Further, the bishops lands were sacked. A Protestant receveur was established to undertake leases of the ecclesiastical land for the diocese of Montpellier, and they issued 78 leases. However many of them would fall into arrears. Antoine de Rapin was established as the governor of Montpellier.\nMontmorency tasked Joyeuse with recapturing Montpellier for the royalist cause with an army of Provençal and Italian soldiers. However, the campaign would be a failure and Joyeuse retired to Pézenas. Joyeuse would find success in an assault on Limoux which succeeded in recapturing the town sometime before August. A second siege of Montpellier would be combatted by Crussol, who dispatched the baron d'Ambres to relieve the city, a task which he successfully accomplished. Montpellier complained to Crussol in December that nearby towns were not paying for military companies, forcing Montpellier to shoulder the burden. It was requested that the benefitting towns reimburse the city. They further asked that payment be given for their ministers and a college. Crussol and the conseil denied the request and requested Montpellier fund such things from its own citizenry. Having heard reports of sedition in Montpellier, Crussol dispatched a member of the Languedoc council to the city to solve matters. That same month, Crussol relieved Rapin from his command of the city. The consuls of Montpellier protested that they now had neither captain nor troops to defend them. A delegation was sent to Crussol praising Rapin, and asking that if he must be reassigned that a similarly god-fearing replacement be found. They similarly requested that 5-600 troops be provided for the town at the provinces expense. Therefore, the sieur de Péyrault was chosen for Montpellier, with Crussol informing Montpellier on 30 January 1563. No extra troops were provided as the consuls had requested. In March the failure of Montpellier to provide the financial support to German mercenaries in Lyon that was requested led to the arrest of the cities consuls for 1562. After this stern measure, the administration attempted again to raise the funds for Crussol.\n\n\n=== Béziers ===\nIn November, garrisons were established by Crussol around Béziers for the purpose of frustrating the royalist lieutenant-general Joyeuse. In early 1563 settlements continued to be captured around Béziers by the Protestants.\nThe former governor of Montpellier, Rapin was moved with his troops to Béziers by Crussol. In January Crussol received a plea for aid from Béziers as unpaid soldiers were getting rowdy. Governor Rapin was absent on campaign. Thus Crussol sent a captain 'La Grille' in February to re-establish order. Further men would be sent to resolve tensions in the city during February. Lack of pay continued to endanger the towns security into March and according to the Histoire Ecclésiastique were it not for the captains closing the gates, soldiers may have abandoned Béziers. Rapin would again be reassigned to a new charge, becoming governor of Castres.\n\n\n=== Saint-Gilles ===\nOn 25 September Catholic forces from Arles captured Saint-Gilles. This was unacceptable to the Protestant leadership of Nîmes, who could not tolerate a Catholic outpost so near to their city, as such they dispatched a force to retake Saint-Gilles. Two days later on 27 September a Protestant force seized Saint-Gilles and massacred the Catholics of the town, including women and children. The force from Arles was caught on the banks of Rhône as it tried to withdraw, and was cut down.\n\n\n=== Lauzerte ===\nWhen Lauzerte was stormed by the forces of the Protestant seigneur de Duras the town was subject to a massacre. According to the Protestant Histoire Ecclésiastique 567 people of the town were killed, among them 194 priests.\n\n\n=== Albi ===\nHeadquartering his operations at Albi, the archbishop of Albi co-ordinated royalist military efforts as lieutenant-general of the Albigeois. Striking out from Albi, the archbishop oversaw the capture of Gaillac and châteaux in the Tarn valley. His troops collaborated with a local labourer to undertake a massacre in the town.\n\n\n=== Rabastens ===\nIn response to the royalist Catholic massacre at Gaillac the rebel Protestants undertook a massacre of Catholics at Rabastens.\n\n\n=== Gévaudan ===\nIn November, the comte de Crussol established garrisons across the Gévaudan in the hopes of frustrating the Catholic commander Jacques d'Apchier who operated in the region.\n\n\n=== Mende ===\nIt would be a Protestant minister from the Gévaudan who acted as the Protestant captain that oversaw the capture of Mende in July. Once the town was conquered, he set to work administering the town with the support of several others.\n\n\n== Foix ==\nThe royalist governor of Foix, the seigneur de Pailhès made efforts to reconquer the capital of the province from the Protestants, it having only recently been seized. Failing in this he was equally unsuccessful in his various efforts to subdue the Protestant held city of Pamiers.\nIn March 1563, Protestants orchestrated a massacre of Catholics in Pamiers.\n\n\n== Dauphiné ==\n\nThe lieutenant-general of Dauphiné, La Motte-Gondrin, earned the antipathy of the provinces Protestant population when he oversaw the execution of a pastor and Protestant seigneur of Romans. He had, with a band of gentleman, also slaughtered a rural Protestant congregation of around 60 persons.\n\n\n=== Adrets' campaigns ===\n\nValence (27 April), Romans, Gap, Die and Vienne all fell to the Protestant cause of Condé between the months of March and May 1562. After the assassination of La Motte-Gondrin, the new lieutenant-general Maugiron found himself at a loss as to where in his province to even base his command. Leadership of the rebel cause was taken up by the baron des Adrets. Adrets came to affiliate with the opposition to the Guise in part due to a feud he had with the vidame d'Amiens for his actions during the Italian Wars that resulted in Adrets' capture. Amiens was a client of Guise's. The rebel Protestant baron des Adrets, who was renowned for his brutality, had great skill in the manoeuvre of his forces rapidly during the campaign. He wrote to Catherine assuring her of his loyalty to the crown, and promising to come to the capital to free her and her son. In every town that fell to Adrets, Catholicism was outlawed. He forced the garrisons of Pierrelatte, Saint-Marcellin and Montbrison to jump from the walls of the town or cliffs after their capture, as part of efforts to instill terror in his opponents. In one town of Forez eighteen prisoners were thrown from the tower in July. On 13 May Calvin wrote to Adrets urging him to exercise greater control over the crimes of his soldiers, so that they might pillage less. When Adrets captured Montélimar, the murder of the garrison was accompanied by cries expressing that it was revenge for the Papal brutalities in Orange. During his campaign in Provence, he captured Valréas (where he bested in battle the comte de Suze on 25 July), Sorgues and Cavaillon and then prepared to march on Avignon.\nAmong the Protestant leadership of Condé and Coligny Adrets was not a popular commander. Condé replaced him as governor of Lyon with the sieur de Soubise, meanwhile Coligny criticised Adrets in letters to Soubise. Coligny's letters to Soubise were intercepted and published by the Catholics. Feeling betrayed by his superiors Adrets increasingly moved towards dealings with the Catholic army of the duc de Nemours that he was in theory opposing. In December he drew up a truce plan for Dauphiné by which the province would recognise the authority of Nemours under whom Adrets would serve as lieutenant with powers in his absence. All Dauphinois Protestants would enjoy freedom of conscience in their homes, but ministers would be expelled from the province. The Protestant provincial estates, assembled at Montélimar met to consider these terms, with the Protestant ministers present strongly opposed them. Ultimately Adrets' peace plan was defeated.\nThe assembly at Montélimar further made attendance of Protestant services mandatory and subjected the entire population to ecclesiastical discipline. Political authority was reserved for those who had been Protestant for at least six months. Unrepentant Catholics were to be banished. Games of chance, 'profane songs' and blasphemy were all prohibited, with the latter subject to corporal punishment.  There were to be two councils, the conseil de guerre (war council) and conseil politique (political affairs council). The latter would decide the wage of Adrets and other military leaders. Adrets was not to enter into any accord with the royalists without approval from the conseil de guerre. Military ordonnances issued by Adrets and Coligny were to be followed. A levy of 60,000 livres was made with a further 30,000 livres to be loaned. Catholic revenues would be seized, with the benefices rented out.\n\nIn January 1563, Adrets' dealings with Nemours became too much and he was arrested by his subordinates Montbrun and Mauvans. He was alleged to have planned to betray Lyon to the royalists. He was held in captivity in Nîmes. Adrets would be replaced by the sieur de Soubise as the leader of the Protestant war efforts in the Lyonnais. In the later civil wars, Adrets would fight for the crown and Catholic cause.\n\n\n=== Crussol's charge ===\nIn a further development in January, Crussol was made leader of Protestant Dauphiné in Adrets' stead, being elected commander during an assembly at Valence in January. The conseil de guerre was to advise him in all matters of war and follow his commands faithfully. Crussol was to inform the conseil politique of any appointments he made (for governors or captains of towns), and was granted a salary of 6,000 livres a year. All able bodied men were to be involved in the war effort, with nobles leviable at Crussol's discretion, requiring permission to rest neutrally on their estates. Crussol convoked an assembly in February to decide Adrets' fate.\nMeanwhile, Crussol appointed Montbrun with authority over the Valentinois and Diois while the seigneur de Saint-Auban was elevated over the territory from Montélimar to the Comtat Venaissin. The maintenance and expansion of fortifications and troop payments were the responsibility of the overall administration. A further loan of 20,000 livres was to be made. Those who pillaged churches or took clerical revenues illegally would be subject to punishment from the Protestant apparatus. Such actions denied funds to the administration and would be difficult to explain to the king. Anabaptists and those who called for the abolition of feudalism were to be subject to punishment. Council meetings were not to take place during Protestant services and all days except Sunday were to be devoted to work.\n\n\n=== Valence ===\n\nThe baron des Adrets stormed Valence on 27 April. Shortly after its capture, the lieutenant-general of Dauphiné, La Motte-Gondrin who was present in the city was hanged.\nThe ordonnance of Valence, which were issued by the Protestant rebels in January/February 1563 admitted that some of their previous financial demands on the city had been excessive. Crussol permitted Valence to provide a sum of their choosing as opposed to the one that had been set for them after protest from their consuls.\nThat April the Valence consistory wrote to Crussol deploring the possibility that Maugiron and the parlement of Grenoble might return to the province with the peace. He was urged to make this opinion known at the court. Valence asked Romans for support in this, however the Romans consuls advised they were happy to trust in Crussol's judgement.\n\n\n=== Romans ===\nIn May 1563 dispute arose in Protestant controlled Romans between the consuls of the town and the military administration over control of the gates. The consuls were hesitant to hand over control of the gates to the governor and suggested they would only do so if Crussol ordered them to. Crussol ordered the military formation that was in the city to leave Romans. Romans attempted to avoid the imposition of a garrison by the Protestant conseil politique based in Valence on grounds of poverty and a desire to defend the town with their own citizens. Eventually a garrison would be consented to, with Crussol informing the consuls that they must defer to the conseil politique. \n\n\n=== Vienne ===\nIn Vienne the Protestants forced the bishop Jean de La Brosse to flee.  By the end of the year, when there was dispute over the renewal of the cities consulate, a man named des Granges proposed the exclusion of Protestants from the office as 'people must be united in religion to exist in harmony and friendship'.\n\n\n=== Die ===\nProtestants, largely led by the artisans and merchants seized the town of Die. The community became notable for the large proportion of its population that volunteered itself for participation in the Protestant army of Guyenne. Of a total population of around 4,000, roughly 700 men left to join the Protestant army.\n\n\n=== Montélimar ===\nMontbrun fought in Dauphiné, as he had in 1560. On 28 June he issued a command to 26 of the churches of the province, urging them to bring to him the soldiers they had raised in the month prior to Montélimar by 1 July, in addition to any other men capable of bearing arms. Any who failed to heed the summons would be hanged.\n\n\n=== Grenoble ===\nGrenoble was captured for the rebel Protestant cause on 25 June by a force under the command of the baron des Adrets. One of the commissioners (André de Ponnat) who had served to peace keep in Provence in early 1562 was established as the rebel Protestant governor of the city.\nMaugiron menaced the region around Grenoble in early 1563, pillaging the region of Trièves. The Protestants meanwhile consolidated their hold on Grenoble with continued conquests of communities around the city.\nGrenoble was put under siege by a royalist force on 1 March. The comte de Crussol therefore made plans to relieve the city, assembling a force at Romans including an amount of artillery. To this end the Protestant minister of Valence wrote to the Protestant communities of Valence and Montélimar urging them to send troops in support of Crussol. Grenoble itself was subject to a barrage of artillery from Maugiron and the comte de Suze for several days before Crussol's approach caused them to retreat to Vienne. Crussol was able to successfully relieve the siege of Grenoble on 4 March. After making orders related to Grenoble's fortifications on 5 March, Crussol moved off to the Comtat Venaissin.\n\n\n== Comtat Venaissin ==\nCrussol launched a punitive expedition into the Papal territories in March 1563. He justified his campaign on the grounds that the Papal commander Fabrizzio di Serbollini had acted aggressively against French territories, subjecting French towns to \"infinite cruelties\". It has also been argued Crussol was responding to an appeal from the Protestants of Orange. Serbollini had indeed seized Camaret and Sérignan-du-Comtat towards the start of March, taking advantage of French attention being diverted. As such, for Crussol the campaign was a royal one to defend the kingdom of France against an external aggressor.\nCrussol arrived with 2,000 infantry, 600 cavalry and several cannons. These had been levied from both Dauphiné and Languedoc. Towards the middle of March he invested Sérignan. Serbollini was elsewhere (Orange) and only some of his troops were available for the defence of the town. Crussol established himself at Pont-Saint-Esprit and undertook the preparations for a proper siege, including ensuring the supply of all the components of artillery, as well as pioneers. Serbollini despatched troops to frustrate the siege and while Crussol was able to drive them off it came at a heavy price. During the siege his brother Charles de Crussol, abbot of Feuillans was killed. Soldiers continued to arrive to reinforce Crussol, as well as new cannons. The town eventually fell to him and both the garrison and population were massacred. The bloody nature of fighting in the Venaissin allowed his reputation to be relatively unaffected by the brutality of the campaign. The surrounding region quickly fell to him.\nAfter the massacre of Sérignan, Orange opened its gates to Crussol. A garrison was installed in the city under the command of the seigneur de Saint-Auban who was also given charge of the Comtat Venaissin by Crussol as he departed back to Languedoc. Under Saint-Auban's leadership, many more towns in the Papal territory fell to the Protestants.\n\n\n== French Piemont ==\n\nDuring August it was decided in council at Blois that it would be necessary to return the four French towns that France had maintained in Piemonte as a term of the peace of Cateau-Cambrésis to the duca di Savoia (duke of Savoia). The towns in question were Turin, Chieri, Villanova d'Asti and Chivasso. Savoia's support was seen as increasingly important for the crown as the war grew bloodier. Moreover, by ceding the towns the soldiers who garrisoned the places for France would be freed up for the royalist cause. To this end the lieutenant-general of French Piemont the seigneur de Bourdillon, the bishop of Orléans, René de Birague and Alluye were established as a commission to see to the restoration of the towns.\nBourdillon refused to hand the towns over to Savoia, arguing that the king was only a minor and could not rule on such matters. By October Bourdillon had been convinced to accede to the surrender of his towns. Catherine wrote desperately for Alluye to hurry in his efforts, as d'Andelot had recently entered the kingdom at the head of a German mercenary force. Passing through Savoia on his way to the Council of Trent in November, the cardinal de Lorraine signed the Treaty of Fossano with the duca di Savoia. To compensate Bourdillon for surrendering his governate to Savoia, Alluye promised the lieutenant-general that he would receive the first vacant office of Marshal that arose. Fortunately for Alluye and Bourdillon it came to pass that in December marshal Thermes died and therefore Bourdillon received his baton. Savoia granted to France in return for the surrender of these towns the small settlements of Pinerolo, Savigliano and Perosa.\n\n\n== Catholic leagues ==\n\n\n=== Agen ===\nOn 4 February 1563 Monluc established a Catholic league at Agen by which its members swore to protect the Catholic church and oppose the Protestant faith. Historians of the Agenais have seen it as an attempt to build a counter-infrastructure to that established by the Protestants at the synods of Clairac and Sainte-Foy. Monluc distributed the ordinance to neighbouring territories and Condom, Casteljaloux, Périgueux and the Quercy assured that they would work together.\nThe Catholic league of the Agenais was dismantled by Monluc in April in accordance with the edict of Amboise. Its legacy would however remain among the Catholic population of the region.\n\n\n=== Toulouse ===\n\nIn February 1563, the parlement of Toulouse brought together Monluc, Joyeuse, and other Catholic leaders of the south together for the formation of a more ambitious and far reaching league. This was on the pretext that another uprising by Toulouse's Protestants was possible. Cardinal d'Armagnac, and the archbishop of Albi spent March organising a meeting of Catholic officials at which they formed an anti-Protestant league. Also present among its members were the comte de Nègrepelisse, the seigneur de Forquevaux (governor of Narbonne) and the comte de Terride (governor of Toulouse). The league was made public on 2 March in a ceremony at the Cathedral of Toulouse. All Catholics were to become members of the league and to this effect the ordonnance was distributed, to be read in all towns by the crier and displayed. The Catholic hardliners asked Monluc to put himself at the head of their league and to lead a Catholic army. This league began to assemble arms and men. Towns would be required to swear oaths in the leagues favour before Joyeuse, on pain of being declared rebels if they did not. The goal of the league was to purge 'sedition and rebels' from the kingdom.\nWhen word arrived of the edict of Amboise, which prohibited all such leagues the organisation was dissolved even before the edict had been registered by the parlement of Toulouse. Monluc withdrew from Toulouse to his estates at Estillac stating that 'war would not be started under my government'.\n\n\n=== Bordeaux ===\nThe lieutenant-general of Dax, the comte de Candalle put himself at the head of a southern league in Bordeaux during March 1563, and many murders of Protestants were attributed to his organisation.  On 10 March, Monluc had made a triumphant entry into Bordeaux with the comte de Candalle serving in his guard of honour. On 17 March, Candalle presented a denunciation of the premier président of the Bordeaux parlement Lagebâton before the assembled body, while his armed supporters waited outside the chamber. Lagebâton attacked Candalle's request to his colleagues, highlighting it contained only two signatures, and if it truly did represent a gathering of Catholic nobility then it was illegal. Lagebâton argued further that on 15 March Candalle and his various allies had schemed this attack on his presidency, after this the assembly broke down into angry recriminations. The exact timing of Candalle's leagues formation is a matter of dispute, some suggesting Candalle formed it as a response to his failures in front of Lagebâton while others that he formed it on 13 March.\nThe Catholic league headed by the comte de Candalle refused to disband after the registration of the edict of Amboise by the Bordeaux parlement on 10 April. A few days later, the Protestant noble the sieur de Pardaillan, and premier président of the Bordeaux parlement complained to Catherine that an association had formed for the carrying out of 'evil deeds'. The latter urged Catherine to entrust suppression of the league to Monluc. Monluc reported he was not aware of any illegal associations. Lagebâton brought Candalle before the chamber on 4 May to answer for his league, and the comte again denounced Lagebâton in the name of the nobility. The conflict would continue to gestate over the following months bringing into it the commissioners sent out by the crown who ultimately failed to conclude whether Candalle's league existed or not.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nBabelon, Jean-Pierre (2009).

        "content": "The 1559–1562 French political crisis was induced by the death of the king Henri II in July 1559. With his death, the throne fell to François II who though not a minor, lacked the ability to command authority due to his young age. Actual power fell to two of Henri II's favourites, the duc de Guise (duke of Guise) and cardinal de Lorraine who quickly moved to assert a monopoly of their authority over the administration of the kingdom. Royal patronage would flow to them and their clients, with those of their rival, Constable Montmorency quickly starved of royal favour. Having been left with ruinous debts by Henri, they undertook a campaign of aggressive austerity which further alienated many grandees and soldiers who were not shielded from its effects (as the clients of the Lorraine brothers were). They also continued the persecution of Protestantism that had transpired under Henri II, though with the young François on the throne the Protestants felt emboldened to resist.\nTo this end aggrieved Protestants and political opponents of the Lorraine brothers administration formulated a conspiracy to assume control of the king and end the Lorraine administration. This manifested in an attempted conspiracy at Amboise in March 1560. Guise and Lorraine were able to suppress the conspiracy, crushing it brutally. They suspected that the Protestant prince du sang (prince of the blood) prince de Condé was the architect of the conspiracy, and Condé thus departed from court shortly after the conspiracy under a cloud of suspicion. He joined with his brother, the premier prince du sang the king of Navarre at Navarre's southern court of Nérac and the two spent the summer plotting against the crown. While Amboise had been suppressed at the court, its aftershocks continued to be felt across France, with various disorders, particularly in the south of France. The Lorraine administration attempted to crush the embers of the revolt. At the same time they abandoned the persecutory policy of Henri II and differentiated 'heresy' from 'sedition' for the first time. An Assembly of Notables was called to advise on the kingdoms problems in August and it resolved on the convoking of an Estates General and a national church council. At the assembly, Montmorency's nephew Admiral Coligny established himself as a leading voice of the Protestants, representing several of their petitions, much to the annoyance of the Lorraine government. Navarre and Condé were absent from the meeting and after further evidence of their involvement in an attempted coup at Lyon was uncovered they were summoned to the court. They arrived in October for the upcoming Estates General and Condé was arrested for treason. Shortly before the Estates General could meet in December, the young king François died, ending the Lorraine government.\nCatherine de' Medici, the young king's mother, moved to the centre of the political stage as de facto regent for her second son Charles IX. To assume this position she negotiated with Navarre, who as premier prince du sang had a right to the regency. He was bought out of the position in return for the release of his brother Condé from captivity, the position of lieutenant-general of the kingdom and several other concessions. The new administration decided to go further than the Lorraine government in moving towards implicit toleration of Protestantism. In opposition to their alienation from the government and the toleration of Protestantism, Guise, Montmorency and another favourite of Henri II, Marshal Saint-André entered into an agreement in April 1561 that has become known to history as the 'Triumvirate'. They agreed to support the preservation of Catholicism and support one another during the current political crisis. 1561 was a major year of growth for Protestantism, and the Protestants became increasingly bold as they saw favour from the crown. As a result, there was much disorder in the kingdom throughout late 1561, particularly in the south of the kingdom, where a state of civil war emerged between Protestants and Catholics. The crown attempted to pacify these troubles with further religious edicts that continued to wind down the persecution of Protestantism without legalising the religion explicitly, however these failed. In late 1561 the colloquy of Poissy attempted to achieve a religious synthesis between Protestantism and Catholicism, however it devolved into acrimony and in the wake of this failure, Guise, Lorraine and many of the other grandees departed from court in October. Around this time there was also an attempt to kidnap Catherine's third son the duc d'Orléans. By the beginning of 1562 Catherine, and her chancellor Michel de L'Hôpital had resolved that formal toleration of Protestantism would be necessary to sooth the troubles in the kingdom, and to this end published the Edict of Saint-Germain on 17 January. The publishing of the edict finished the alienation of the lieutenant-general Navarre from the government of which he was part, and he aligned himself with the 'Triumvirate'. He summoned Guise to come to court and aid in the opposition to the edict. Guise was at this time at Saverne meeting with the herzog von Wűrttemberg and upon his return he perpetrated the massacre of Wassy, which shortly preceded the outbreak of the first French War of Religion.\n\n\n== Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis ==\n\n\n=== Death of Henri II ===\n\nThe end of the war with España radically changed the distributed of the French gendarmerie, which had in the years of war been concentrated on the frontiers. With compagnies d'ordonnances (ordinance companies) returning to their home provinces, this put at the disposal of the provincial governors a large military force that they had not enjoyed for generations. In prior years, king Henri had declared that not even the king of Navarre was to enjoy an armed guard. Now, all provincial governors had at their disposal hundreds of armed veterans, who travelled with them as large entourages.\nThe establishment of the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis in April 1559 allowed the French monarchy to turn its attention to domestic Protestant 'heresy'. Indeed, in a court increasingly riven by factionalism between the constable de Montmorency and the king's mistress Diane de Poitiers on the one hand and on the other the house of Lorraine as represented by the duc de Guise and the cardinal de Lorraine the crushing of Protestant heresy was the only point upon which unity existed. \n\nTo celebrate the establishment of the peace, and the two marriages contained in its terms (that of Henri's daughter Élisabeth to Felipe II of España and Henri's sister Marguerite to the duca di Savoia (duke of Savoia), Henri decided to host a tournament. Henri was an accomplished rider and therefore participated in the jousts (wearing the colours of his mistress Diane - black and white). He successfully rode against the duca di Ferrara (duke of Ferrara), the duc de Guise (duke of Guise) and duc de Nemours before having an indecisive run against the comte de Montgommery (count of Montgommery) captain of his Garde écossaise (Scottish Guard). With the run having lacked a decisive victory, Henri demanded another pass with the reluctant Montgommery, despite the urgings of his wife Catherine. In their second run, Montgommery's lance pierced Henri's adviser embedding a shard of wood in his eye. Henri was hurriedly carried to the palais des Tournelles where despite medical attention he died on 10 July. In his final hours, Catherine ensured that Diane was afforded no access to her lovers bedside, and she further kept Montmorency away when her husband was unconscious, though on regaining consciousness Henri would insist on the Constable's return.\nProtestants saw the death of their hated persecutor as a sign of divine justice. As their pamphleteers were quick to observe, the very eye with which Henri had vowed to see the Protestant parlementaire (member of the French sovereign court) Anne du Bourg burn had been pierced with a lance. This death brought France into a serious political crisis. In the estimation of Garrisson, it is at this point, and not the 1562 Massacre of Wassy, that the rupture between the noble factions can be observed.\n\n\n=== Ascent of François II ===\n\nWith Henri dead, his young son François ascended to the throne as François II. François, though legally of the age to rule, lacked maturity and experience. He was also racked by illness and therefore actual decision making fell to those around him. In the estimation of Le Roux the apparatus of the French state had insufficient strength to operate without a strong king at its centre. The Lorraine brothers had been in discussions with the king's mother Catherine during the final days of Henri II's life and she had assented to them assuming control of François' government. Devastated by the passing of her husband she had little appetite for taking the reigns of power herself. Therefore, at the recommendation of his mother, the young king looked to his wives uncles the duc de Guise and cardinal de Lorraine to lead his administration.\nA palace revolution quickly followed, with the Montmorency family pushed from their ascendency alongside the king's mistress Diane de Poitiers. The court was moved from the Tournelles to the Louvre, where the duc de Guise and cardinal de Lorraine assumed control of the apartments that Montmorency and Diane had previously enjoyed the use of. The palace revolution was not however comparable with that which had accompanied the ascent of Henri II to the throne in 1547. The ouster of Diane de Poitiers allowed the Guise to restore the chancellor of France, François Olivier to his charge that he had been denied the exercise of his charge during Diane's ascendency. Olivier had an unimpeachable reputation and the Lorraine brothers hoped to be advantaged by this - while making the chancellor dependant on them. Diane's chancellor Jean Bertrand was therefore disgraced. Diane was compelled to surrender the château de Chenonceaux (in return for Chaumont) and the crown jewels she had received from the late king. The disgrace of Diane was an olive branch of the Lorraine family to Catherine, as though Catherine held considerable antipathy for Diane the former favourite's daughter was married to Guise's brother the duc d'Aumale. As a result, Aumale had protested against her disgrace. While Diane and her daughter the duchesse de Bouillon were exiled from the court, Aumale's wife the duchesse d'Aumale was permitted to remain.\nThe king's seal, which Montmorency had held, was taken from him while he was still doing his duty to guard the body of the late king. It was transferred to Lorraine. Montmorency further surrendered his charge of grand maître (grand master), but was allowed to maintain the office of Constable  and the governorship of Languedoc. The charge of grand maître was one of the most prestigious in the kings household, it granted its holder authority over all the nobles of the court. The charge was removed from him on the pretext of his old age (he was 67). The charge of Constable made Montmorency the de facto head of the French military. Guise assumed the office of grand maître sometime between 14 and 17 November and the English ambassador observed him exercising the role on 3 December.  In further consolation to Montmorency, in return for relinquishing the great office of the crown, he received the promotion of his eldest son François to the Marshalate in January 1560.\nIt was rumoured that the Lorraine administration also desired to dispossess Montmorency's nephew the seigneur d'Andelot of his charge as colonel-general of the French infantry, providing it to the comte de La Rochefoucauld (who would go on to marry the Protestant Charlotte de Roye, sister of the princesse de Condé), however this did not come to pass. Guise made a further acquisition with the surrendering of the office of grand chambellan (another great office of the crown) by their kinsmen the duc de Longueville in his favour. Longueville had been betrothed to Guise's daughter Catherine in January of that year, her dowry offset by the ducs support for payments of Longueville's ransom. The office of grand chambellan combined with the office of grand maître gave the duc de Guise a great control over the royal household.\nThe Bourbon princes du sang (princes of the blood - descendants of the French royal line outside the immediate family) also found themselves on the outside of the new administration. This was a reflection of the treason of their kinsmen the the Constable de Bourbon in decades previous. In the senior Bourbon-Vendôme branch, the king of Navarre (who was also the count of Foix and the other Albret lands through his marriage to the queen of Navarre) premier prince du sang - nearest agnatic relative to the king outside the immediate royal family - was away in distant Guyenne. He was informed by Guise of the new Lorraine administration in a letter, the act being presented as a fait accomplit. His younger brother the prince de Condé who was present at court was dispatched for a role in the ratification of the peace of Cateau-Cambrésis which allowed for his temporary removal from court to head to Nederland. Condé lacked the resources of some of the other great grandees and financially damaged himself on this mission in service of presenting himself suitably for his rank before the Spanish king Felipe in Ghent. He had been granted 1,000 écus (crowns) for the mission by the cardinal de Lorraine, which proved insufficient. By contrast in January 1560, Condé was gifted 70,000 livres by the king. \nThe junior branch of princes du sang, the Bourbon-Montpensier, comprised by the duc de Montpensier and the prince de La Roche-sur-Yon contented themselves with quiet enrichment while avoiding a major political role in the new administration. Montpensier received a sum of 1,500 livres from the crown for services he had rendered during Henri's reign. In Durot's estimation the amount was intended to be an insulting political retirement for the prince. The Lorraine brothers were fearful of a Bourbon coup aimed at asserting the right of the princes du sang to the government of France, and to this end when they departed the Tournelles on 10 July after the death of the king, they ensured they were surrounded by their political allies, the duca di Ferrara and the duc de Nemours.\nThe seigneur de Saint-André, Marshal of France, governor of the Lyonnais and former favourite of Henri II, kept himself on good terms with everyone and therefore was able to adapt to the ascendency of the Lorraine brothers in the new administration. To this end he proposed a marriage between his daughter Catherine and one of the sons of the duc de Guise. Though this marriage proposal came to nothing he enjoyed good relations with the government, and was rewarded for his friendship. In April 1560 he received a gift of 13,000 livres, with a further 6,000 in the Autumn.\nThe government of the duc de Guise and cardinal de Lorraine would dominate the young king's short reign. Guise took charge of the military affairs of the administration, leaving finance, justice and diplomacy to his brother Lorraine. The two Lorraine princes ensured that they always maintained physical proximity to François, with the duc de Guise no longer putting himself at the head of the army or going to inspect border fortifications. As such the Lorraine princes' the brothers served as their representatives for the Scottish expedition and Papal Conclave respectively.\nThough the royal councils would be maintained, important decisions were agreed upon by Lorraine and Guise prior to their convention, as a result the grandees on the council rarely attended and were rarely referenced in its decrees. Among those who would attend would be marshal Saint-André, the duc de Montpensier, cardinal de Châtillon and cardinal de Bourbon. Lorraine and Guise were themselves largely absent from the councils, not finding attendance necessary for the execution of their policy. This held true for the king too, and it would sometimes be the case that the deliberations were in an entirely different town to where he was residing, as when he was Saint-German-en-Laye while council was being taken in Pontoise. According to Durot, by the suppression of the importance of the royal council, the Lorraine administration risked the possibility of damaging the legitimacy of the crown.\n\nWhen called into the king's presence in council on 11 July François announced to Montmorency the division of government between the duc de Guise and cardinal de Lorraine to him. Their word was to be obeyed as if it was the word of François himself, the young king said. François highlighted that the Constable's old age would make it difficult for him to continue governing. The Constable, who was with his sons and nephews for the reception was assured that neither his children nor his nephews would be dispossessed of their charges as the king had need of them. Conscious of his need to save face, Montmorency informed François that he had only come to the king to ask for permission to retire from the court. Having received such a cold reception, Montmorency resolved to retire from court to his estates at Chantilly, resigning himself to a lack of control over the government. He departed to Chantilly after the burial of Henri II (which was undertaken at Saint-Denis on 12 August) with a grand retinue of such size as to make the king's appear small. He remained powerful, enjoying his position at the centre of a large web of patronage from his courtly exile. It was indeed this great power that made it difficult for him or his family to be comprehensively disgraced.\nConscious that their assumption of power could be faced with much opposition, hundreds of loyal nobles were brought into the capital at this time by the new Lorraine government. This was to prepare them for any eventuality, among which the possibility of a military counterstroke by the eldest son of Montmorency, the comte de Dammartin, governor of the Île de France was a possibility. However none came, and Montmorency allowed himself to be pushed aside.\n\n\n=== Opposition ===\nFor those opposed to the rise of the Lorraine administration, the 'foreigness' of the Lorraine princes was a tool that could be used against them. This was despite the fact the family had been naturalised as French during the lifetime of their father the first duc de Guise in 1506. Supporters of the Bourbons in this period mockingly noted that the first duc de Guise spoke French with a 'German accent'. Keen to quiet such attacks on Guise and his family, Henri II had raised Joinville to a principality in 1552. Upon the marriage of Marie Stuart (their niece) and the young François, Lorraine was delighted that henceforth 'no one could call them foreign princes'. In addition to being the uncle of the young François' queen the second duc de Guise was married to Anne d'Este a granddaughter of Louis XII. Though they were linked to the French royal family in several ways they were descended from the house of Lorraine. Thus it was argued by some that their administration was a usurpation of the rights that naturally belonged to the princes du sang, chief among them the king of Navarre.\nThe 'foreigness' of the Lorraines was a considerable boon to the Protestant cause. Persecution against them undertaken during the reign of Henri II could not have its legitimacy challenged, however when the persecution was overseen by 'foreign' princes who had 'usurped authority', it could therefore be argued their policy was illegal and it was legitimate to resist.\nEarly in the reign of François II in 1559 there were two notable libels published against their government: the livret de Strasbourg and the mémoire d'Octobre. The former was likely the work of the fervently Protestant François Hotman, who operated out of Strasbourg. The latter's authentic publication is disputed, but it is an anonymous work preserved in the writings of the contemporary historians de Thou and La Place. Both texts emphasised that the Lorraine administration was a tyrannical usurpation. According to the pamphleteers power rightfully belonged with the princes du sang until such time as François was 'truly of age' to rule. The latter text adds an argument that because the government comprised those who had 'submitted to the Pope' (i.e. cardinal de Lorraine) it was illegitimate as this violated the constitution of the kingdom. This was the only reference to religious matters in a pamphlet largely devoted to political and constitutional questions. By this means the pamphlets looked to make opposition to the Lorraine regime appear as more than as the product of Protestant 'heresy'. A common feature of both libels was that as the Lorraine's were foreign princes they could not exercise authority over the kingdom. A narrative followed in which the Guise role in overturning the Truce of Vaucelles in 1556, seizing Napoli in 1557 'exhausted the military' in such a way as to make the defeat of Saint-Quentin possible. As a result of their transgressions the pamphlet argued the king was forced into a dishonourable peace in 1559. The libels did not however make a case for violent resistance to their government, trusting in the laws of the kingdom to rectify the situation.\nOther Protestant libels also made direct attacks on the king. In late 1559 it was thus alleged that 'François bathed in the blood of children to restore his health'.\nThose excluded from authority in the new configuration quickly identified one another. Constable Montmorency, who had been by the king's bedside in his final days urged the Bourbon king of Navarre to hurry to court so they could present a united front. To this end he wrote to the prince the day after the death of Henri. Navarre distrusted this appeall, Montmorency having done little to represent his interests at the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis. Some of those around him assiduously reinforced this, reminding him often of Montmorency's failure to do so. Nevertheless, having consulted with his advisers (among them his chancellor Aymery Bouchard and the comte d'Escars) he departed from his court at Nérac and came north alongside his younger brother the prince de Condé. Navarre's cousin the prince de La Roche-sur-Yon succeeded in convincing him to pause his journey northwards at Vendôme on 31 July where those opposed to the Lorraine government had gathered. He would stay in Vendôme for the next two weeks, where he was urged to assert his rights to the regency. Present in Vendôme for this conference of the opposition were Navarre, Condé (who had returned from Ghent), the comte de La Rochefoucauld, the prince de Porcien and the vidame de Chartres. Also present were a secretary of Montmorency's and the Constable's nephews the three Châtillon brothers (Admiral Coligny, D'Andelot and Cardinal Châtillon). Coligny had many clients in Normandie, while d'Andelot had a network in Bretagne. D'Andelot was already a declared Protestant and was among those who feared the recent persecutory edict of Écouen.\nThe group of malcontents could not agree on strategy, some favouring a military confrontation with the Lorraine government, some an alliance with the young king's mother Catherine de' Medici. It was said that Condé, La Rochefoucauld, Porcien and the vidame de Chartres supported an immediate rebellion, with Condé the most vociferous towards this course. The Constable's secretary and Coligny favoured protesting the Guise administration to the king and negotiating with Catherine. The only true agreement established at the meeting was to end the feud between the Bourbon-Montpensier and Montmorency. The feud had begun in 1547 with a duel between La Roche-sur-Yon and d'Andelot. Some Protestant ministers who were present for the conference urged Navarre to end 'idolatry' at the court. Navarre conducted a secret meeting with a representative of the English ambassador named Killigrew on 8 August. This was reported to the court. Navarre departed Vendôme on 14 August. As his party neared court it slowly fractured and drifted away, as such by the time Navarre arrived on 18 August he had with him only a small party.\nNavarre found few accommodations at court, and had to rely on the Marshal de Saint-André to lodge him as Guise and Lorraine had prepared nothing for him. He was not alerted to council meetings when they transpired. When granted an audience with the young king after several days, Navarre was informed François had entrusted the conduct of his affairs to his wife's uncles and that he expected his subjects to obey them. François informed the king of Navarre that he was concerned about the growth of Protestant heresy. Navarre protested to François that the king could trust in his orthodoxy, to which the king responded that this was a good thing as he would tolerate no deviation from orthodoxy. Navarre would be granted access to the royal council, but would not form part of its innermost decision-making body the conseil des affaires. At this time, two of his own advisers, the comte d'Escars and bishop of Mende worked him over in favour of acceding to a peripheral role in the court. Another noble of his network the seigneur de Jarnac, governor of Poitou despaired in him and offered his services to Navarre's enemies.\nHe was subsequently removed from court by accepting a prestigious mission to accompany the king's sister Élisabeth to España to be united with her new husband Felipe II. By accepting this task, Navarre hoped Felipe might be favourable to the restitution of his kingdom of Navarre, which had largely been conquered by the Spanish in 1513. He had the support of the French crown in this endeavour, François writing a long letter to the Spanish king asking him to make territorial concessions to Navarre. Carpi characterises this as his overarching political goal during this period. The transfer of the princess to her Spanish husband was undertaken in the first days of January 1560. There were various disputes over precedence during the hand-over and the Spanish were contemptful of Navarre. The Protestant preacher La Roche-Chandieu despaired in the efforts to put Navarre at the head of an opposition. His brother Condé likewise bemoaned how Navarre had allowed himself to be removed from the centre of power for this mission. François de Morel, a Protestant pastor who had been at Vendôme wrote furiously to Calvin on 15 August decrying Navarre as a 'coward' and a 'fool' for his failure to 'do his duty'. He asked Calvin, whether it was truly only Navarre who had the right to demand a meeting of the Estates General or resist tyranny by violent means failing this. Sutherland suggests that this indicates Calvin was not entirely adverse to violent action. Walzer argues that Calvin was open to resistance up to the seriousness of tyrannicide when the initiative for the action was god.\n\n\n=== Lorraine administration ===\n\nWhen the royal secrétaires d'État (secretaries of state) reported to the young king, François informed them to direct their business to Catherine. In practice however this meant they would report to the Lorraine brothers. Many letters that were addressed to the king were accompanied by longer letters addressed directly to the Lorraine brothers. Upon the death of the secrétaire d'État du Thier shortly into the new administration around March 1560, the Lorraine brothers selected the seigneur d'Alluye to replace him. Alluye, and his cousin the seigneur de Fresne who was also a secrétaire d'État were both firmly Catholic, and had sympathies with the Lorraine faction at court. Sutherland argues this private affiliation did not influence the policy they pursued in their official capacity. The secrétaire L'Aubespine affiliated himself with Catherine.\nThe registers of the secrétaires would reflect the domination of the court now enjoyed by the Lorraine family. Royal patronage flowed to the family and their clients, and dried up for clients of Montmorency and Diane. Indeed 74% of royal gifts in 1560 would go to the clients of Guise and Lorraine while for Montmorency the figure fell to 0%. As a result of this many nobles sought to ingratiate themselves as clients of the family. Among the nobles who turned to the Lorraine family was the governor of Berry, who had formerly been in Montmorency's patronage network.\nIn the 1559 promotions for the royal Ordre de Saint-Michel (Order of Saint-Michel - the highest French chivalric order) the Lorraine government inducted Felipe II of España and the duca di Savoia. In addition to these grand foreign appointments, they rewarded those close to them. Their brother the grand prieur received the award, in addition to one of Guise's companions in arms from the latter Italian Wars.\nPicardie became a pawn in the factional struggles that engulfed the crown during the reign of François II. In January 1560 Coligny, nephew of the Constable was ousted from the governorship of Picardie in favour of the comte de Brissac. Coligny had been frustrated at the Lorraine administrations refusal to fund the rebuilding of the fortifications of Calais and Saint-Quentin. The author of his displacement is variously ascribed to Guise (on the grounds that Brissac was a more reliable Catholic) and Catherine (that Brissac was a reliable servant of the crown). Guise had appreciated Brissac's commitment to the Italian project of the previous years. Back in July 1559 the idea of Coligny's replacement with Condé had been floated, it is thus possible Coligny might have acceded to his ouster on this understanding. Guise certainly saw advantage in the implication, and let it be known to Coligny that Condé was the source of his displacement. On the subject of his ouster, Coligny opined to D'Humières that he was unable to handle the joint responsibilities of governor and admiral, and thus his departure was not compelled. If it had been intended to provide the governate to Condé, this proposal was abandoned after the conspiracy of Amboise and the governate was invested in Brissac at the end of March 1560. Brissac at first refused, pleading that he was too old for such a charge. Nevertheless, he would acede to the responsibility. Durot speculates his initial refusal may have been from fear that accepting the governorship would leave him too dependant on the Guise government.\nFrançois undertook his coronation at Reims on 18 September 1559. Durot notes that the coronation was a hurried ceremony that lacked much in the way of pomp. This was due to the Lorraine brothers desire to quickly assure themselves that the king was consecrated. The cardinal de Lorraine crowned the young king. Navarre stood in for the role traditionally occupied by the duc de Bourgogne during the coronation ceremony (the most senior of the peers), flattering his sensibilities. He did not object, when his cousin the duc de Montpensier was made to give way in the ceremony to the duc de Nevers. Nevers was not a prince du sang unlike Montpensier. However this action was taken because Nevers had been elevated to the duché pairie (ducal-peerage) a month prior to Montpensier.\nMuch of the policy of the reign of François II would be in continuity with that established by Henri II during early 1559.\n\n\n=== Legacy of war ===\n\nThe new administration was faced with the large debts which had in part driven Henri to endorse the peace of Cateau-Cambrésis (totalling around 40,000,000 livres). As such they embarked on an aggressive campaign of austerity. The Lorraine brothers themselves were partly responsible for the deficits creation through their advocacy for Henri's war policy in prior years. The marriages of the peace of Cateau-Cambrésis were also expensive, with Élisabeth's dowry totalling around 1,000,000 livres. The monetary crisis was furthered by the large influx of precious metals (gold and silver) from the 'new world'. As a result of this influx the livre was devalued. In total between 1501 and 1560 its value decreased by 56%. Many of those in France lost 2/3 of their purchasing power. This particularly impacted the rural nobility.\nAs a result of the financial difficulties, the crown's creditors were becoming increasingly restless, the Tuscan ambassador reporting in November that complaints were on the rise from the Florentine merchatns of Lyon. Lorraine led the charge on soothing the kingdoms financial ills. He was assisted in this effort by the premier président (first president) of the chambres des comptes (chamber of accounts) and former councillor in parlement (sovereign courts of France) L'Hôpital. L'Hôpital was a client of Lorraine's who in his work thanked the Cardinal for having 'twice saved him' from slanders. Towards the aim of increasing revenues forced loans were raised on the provinces, Normandie alone being expected to provide 800,000 livres, though this forced loan would not be paid. Most of the measures the government undertook were towards decreasing expenditure. Much of the soldiery was disbanded by an edict on 14 July, with payment of their pay which was in arrears deferred. The strength of the gendarmerie (heavy cavalry) was reduced from 8,800 to 6,275 men, a cut which saved the treasury around 700,000 livres (pounds) a year. This affected the 64 companies, which were captained by many of the most powerful nobles in the kingdom. Royal pensions were suspended, alienations of crown lands undertaken to finance the war revoked (by edict on 18 August, with the exception of lands alienated for dowries), and the interest on royal debt reduced by almost half. Survivances (assuming an office via inheritance) to royal offices were cancelled. Commissioners were dispatched to recover the money of the forced loan of 1558 for the crown. Some royal offices were suppressed, and there was a particularly notable decline in the number of maître des requêtes from 1558 to 1566 as a result of Lorraine's policy on this front.\nDiscontented soldiers gathered to voice their displeasure to the Lorraine brothers at the château de Fontainebleau. Guise took a sympathetic approach, apologising for the poverty of the crown, and assuring them they would see employment by the crown again soon. Lorraine took a more aggressive approach, ordered them to depart under pains of execution, gallows having been erected around the château to convey this message to the soldiers. François published an edict by which all those who had come to court over grievances of payment or other financial matters were to withdraw within 24 hours or be hanged. The soldiers departed, furious and eager for revenge.\nEither at this time or at the outbreak of civil war in 1562, Guise established the first three regiments of infantry in the French army. It was hoped that a greater structure could be provided to the infantry than that which existed below the office of colonel-general. It had the further advantage of creating captains who were not clients of the colone-general of the infantry, d'Andelot.\nThis austerity was not equally applied, and those who were clients of the Lorraine family were spared many of its effects. For example, Guise was not deprived of his control of Dourdan, Provins and Saumur by the revocation of alienations. Carroll describes this approach as 'nakedly partisan'. Lorraine for his part would be exempted from contributions to the clerical taxes such as the décime. The younger Lorraine brothers, such as the marquis d'Elbeuf and grand prieur were granted royal gifts of 45,000 livres and 8,000 livres respectively for their services. The duc de Longueville (who from August 1560 was under the wardship of the cardinal de Lorraine), received a gift of 50,000 livres in May 1560. The duc de Guise's kinsmen the duca di Ferrara (duke of Ferrara) who due to his role as a key creditor of the kingdom had been ceded the rights to nominate all royal officials in and around Caen was likewise exempt from the return of alienated territories. In return he advanced the crown 600,000 livres.  As a result of this partisanship it was particularly radicalising to the clients of Montmorency and Protestant nobles who could not affiliate themselves with Guise. Those soldiers deprived of their pensions by the administration had the potential to be able to receive subsidies if they enjoyed the support of a relative who was on the in with the administration.\nAs far as alienations are concerned, Montmorency was deprived of the comté (county) de Beaumont that he had been granted in 1527, which had a value of around 50,000 livres. Marshal Saint-André, governor of the Lyonnais lost the seigneurie (lordship) of Saint-Seine-sur-Vigeanne and the seigneur de Monluc (who would go on to be the lieutenant-general of Guyenne) lost the comté de Gaure. In total the value of the land reclaimed by the crown is estimated by Harding to be worth around 2,500,000 livres. Saint-André tried to protect himself from alienations through offering his daughter in marriage to a son of the duc de Guise. Despite thesse reclamations, by 1567 the crowns revenues from annual domain receipts would amount to only 20,000 livres in comparison to the half a million it had reached in 1523.\nAmong the grandees, Guise was the only one who could look to territorial expansion in the post 1559 period. To this end he acquired the seigneurie de Cuverville in Normandie in September 1559.\nMontmorency and Guise became involved in a dispute over which of them enjoyed the rights to the comté de Dammartin. Montmorency had first secured the territory through purchased of the rights from Philippe de Boulainvilliers one of the claimants to the comté. Guise struck back by buying the rights of the other claimant the sieur de Rambures for 18,000 livres, and trying to persuade Boullainvilliers to rescind her selling. Montmorency had little patience for Guise's attempt to intrude on the seigneurie and surprised the place, where Guise had stationed soldiers. Bringing artillery to bear to allow him to defend his claim to the comté. He despatched his son Damville to inform Guise of his resoluteness to maintain the territory. The matter therefore went to the courts.\nBy 1560 the financial situation was stabilising, if not improving. François issued a new edict in which on the pretext of the poverty of the kingdoms subjects he prohibited the giving of gifts to royal officers. This served as a mechanism to control the flow of wealth to provincial governors and other powerful lords. Montmorency in his capacity as governor of Languedoc protested pleading that he and his clients needed to accept the money offered to them by the province (among which was a sum of 18,000 livres for himself). He was informed by Lorraine that there were to be no exceptions to the king's edict.\nAccording to Le Roux, the king himself was the source of edicts established against the carrying of weapons on 23 July and 17 December. First time offenders were to be subject to a 500 écus fine, with second time offenders to be hanged. In Durot's estimation, it was the insecurity of the Lorraine administration that led to the brothers getting the king to put forward the edict of 23 July. The weapon ban would be widely flouted.\n\n\n=== Religious affairs ===\n\nThe Lorraine brothers continued the religious policy that had transpired under Henri II and before him François I, persecution of Protestantism. Henri had issued persecutory edicts in 1549, 1550, 1551, 1557 and finally in 1559. The final edict, that of Écouen would be characterised by the historian Crété as a 'declaration of war' on Protestantism. Montmorency would proudly take credit for it as his design. The Lorraine family did not yet have the reputation it would develop later for rigid orthodoxy, and the Spanish ambassador instead looked to Montmorency as the pre-eminent defender of Catholicism in France. Indeed, the cardinal de Lorraine was suspected by the priest Haton in 1558 as being part of the 'party of heretics', and the family was appealed to by the Protestant cantons of the Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft after the persecutory edict of Compiègne to allow the king's subjects to live in peace. Until late 1559 it was Montmorency who was seen as the preeminent ultra-Catholic of the court. Nevertheless, Metz, which was under the government of the cardinal de Lorraine had a reputation for a government particularly committed to harsh repression.\nIn the first months of the new kings reign raids were organised against Protestant lodgings in Paris. This included assaults into the faubourg (suburb) Saint-Germain, where there was a district known as 'little Genève'. The gentleman who had gathered to worship defended themselves with arms. Further inspections of houses were met by armed Protestants. Various texts were recovered from the raids, containing remonstrances to the king on both religious and political grounds. In particular, one treatise belonging to a noble named La Fredonnière, was noted privately by the procureur du roi (crown prosecutor) as being very well reasoned, even if applied to poor ends. Jouanna postulates it may have been a discussion of legal methods to remove the Guise from power. New laws were established against Protestantism. As early as 25 August, François requested a doctrinal condemnation of certain views on the mass and sacrament from the theological faculty of Paris - which complied several days later. On 4 September an edict established at Villers-Cotterêts declared that houses used for covert Protestant meetings were to be razed. This law would be registered on 23 December, with the parlement being reluctant to register the harsh terms. On 9 November, a new law made those who hosted or attended Protestant meetings liable for the death penalty. According to the edict the meetings not only attacked the mass but also the king. It was obligatory to report such meetings if one was aware of them. This introduced an element of popular involvement to the campaign against Protestantism. Informers could enjoy a share of the property confiscated from convicted heretics. The parlements of Aix and Toulouse were particularly rigorous in applying the persecutory edicts.\nIn a famous case on 23 December, the Protestant parlementaire Anne du Bourg was strangled and then burned at the stake. The other parlementaires who had been arrested alongside him on grounds of heresy were released after recanting. Their trials were largely softball affairs, their parlementaire colleagues not keen to see any of their number executed, and therefore offering every opportunity for them to exculpate themselves. Du Bourg's execution came despite the pleas of much of the Protestant world in his favour, among them the Kurfürst von der Pfalz (elector of the Palatine) and the duchessa di Savoia (duchess of Savoia) . One of the parlementaire judges  most associated with the ultra-wing of the chamber that had moved for du Bourgs execution, president Minard, was assassinated on 12 December while returning home from the palais de justice by masked gunmen. The gates to Paris were hurriedly closed while the assassination was investigated. A Scotsman named Robert Stuart was arrested but confessed nothing under torture. Du Bourg also denied any knowledge of the plot from prison. The assassination of Minard made the government keener to see the execution of du Bourg through. While there was a prospect of the execution being avoided after he agreed to a carefully worded confession of faith on 13 December, he renounced his signature of the document on 19 December.\nIn this month, there was a riot at Saint-Médard in Paris during which several suspected Protestants were killed. According to a Catholic observer, the Protestants had made an assault on the church. On 25 December revenge was attained with the mortal wounding of the priest of the church of Saint-Médard while he was conducting mass.\nFinally in February 1560 a law declared that it was the responsibility of all seigneurs who enjoyed the rights of high justice to apply the preceding anti-Protestant legislation or else they would void their rights to exercise such high justice.\n\n\n=== Protestant initiative ===\nDuring May 1559, the Protestants conducted their first national synod in France, meeting secretly in Paris. The synod offered an opportunity for the establishment of policy. A confession of faith was approved by the assembled delegates, and the discipline of the ecclesiastical hierarchy was established. The forms adopted were largely modelled on those of Genève. Each church in the kingdom was to enjoy equal status. A representative from Poitiers proposed that they should tolerate theological diversity, a view which saw him expelled. The synod affirmed that the appropriate fate for heretics was burning. A representative present from Saint-Lô challenged the practice of tithes. They were responded to firmly by the elders present that though the priest unjustly usurped tithes to their own ends that it was necessary to pay them so as to be in obedience to the king. This would be broadened later to highlight the importance for Protestants of paying all royal taxes. This kept the Protestant movement in France formally in line with the thinking of Calvin on royal authority. Article 40 of the confession of faith that was devised expressed the need to obey laws, taxes and other aspects of seigneurial authority with a 'good will'. Despite this when the matter of the establishment of Protestant churches and conduct of preaching was raised, condemnation was avoided, despite Protestant churches and preaching both being against the king's law.\nEarly in the reign of the new king, the Protestants reached out to the king's mother Catherine and she offered them her tacit support on the condition they conducted themselves secretly and without scandal. This caused a growth in confidence among the Protestants, and she was informed that god would not leave the crime of du Bourg's killing unpunished and it would be visited on her and her children. Catherine was frustrated by this, and expounded to Condé (who had converted to Protestantism in August 1558), his wife Éléonore de Roye and Coligny that her sympathy to Protestantism derived from pity and compassion, not any opinion on their doctrine. She was distressed to see the Protestants brutalised not for any act of sedition but simply for their opinions, As a result of the Protestant rebuke she had received, she dropped her objection to the policy of raids that was being undertaken by the Lorraine government. She also did not intervene in du Bourg's favour and he was executed on 23 December. Nevertheless, she maintained a degree of covert contact with the Protestant community, well aware that they might throw their support behind the king of Navarre.\nEven in 1559 the first acts of Protestant religious radicalism would be witnessable. In the faubourg (suburb) Saint-Marceau of Paris a group of Protestants killed the priest while he was raising the host. The congregation responded by having the doors to the church locked before slaughtering the priests killers.\nLorraine for his part began to support the idea of an assembly of the Gallican church, with even the Calvinist Protestants represented in its deliberations. His flirtations with church reform scandalised the Spanish ambassador Chantonnay. Lorraine was aware that the persecution his government was undertaking was unworkable, and desired to see religious unity restored in the French church.\n\n\n=== Foreign Policy ===\nOn 12 July, Guise wrote to the governor of Metz, Senneterre warning him that the death of Henri might be used as a pretext by the German princes to make an attempt at recapturing the border city from the French. He would also apologise to Senneterre for the failure to pay him or his men for three months.\nIt was important for Guise and Lorraine to reassure the Spanish that the new government intended to abide by the peace established under Henri II. Alongside offering assurances to the Spanish envoys they made signs of friendship to the Spanish king and his Savoyard ally through the awarding of collars of the ordre de Saint-Michel. marshal Brissac was entrusted with the painful task of dismantling the French fortifications in French Piemonte and withdrawing the final French presence from Italia. On frontiers where the territorial concessions of the peace were less one sided, handovers and trades continued into 1560.\nCateau-Cambrésis specified that for French control of Calais (which had been seized in 1558) to be fully established, a sum of 500,000 livres was to be paid to the English. Lorraine was however reticent to honour this term, and opined to the Spanish ambassador that he lacked both the means and the desire to pay the sum and felt under no obligation to do so. To ensure their position on England was followed, the Lorraine administration replaced the English ambassador.\nOn 26 September, François, at the behest of Guise transferred sovereignty over the Barrois to the duc de Lorraine.\nAccording to Carroll, it was in Scotland that the first shots of the civil war were fired.\nThe Lorraine regime, was keen to continue to offer military support for their sister Marie de Lorraine the regent of Scotland. To this end it was intended to send  (the marquis d'Elbeuf and the grand prieur, Guise's young brothers, to the country with reinforcements. While it could not fully alleviate the problem of unemployed soldiers, the Scottish expedition allowed for a redirection of much of the demobilised soldiery of the Italian wars. The first expedition north was conducted in August 1559, to join with the token French force already in Scotland under the command of La Brosse and the bishop of Amiens. The war caused great hardship in the ports of Normandie. Hosting an army and the repair of ships put significant burdens upon the area, with supplies and repairs alone costing 166,454 livres. Admiral Coligny worked hard towards the logistics of the operation, using the opportunity to build upon his clientele network in Normandie. According to the English ambassador in August he travelled to Calais (arriving sometime before the 21st) where he was to arrange 1,500 men to be convoyed to Scotland. Coligny sent orders to Le Havre for the preparation of the rest of the royal fleet to sail. On 2 December, the marquis d'Elbeuf was established by François as the lieutenant-general of Scotland, however Elbeuf lacked much credit in Normandie upon which to base this commission. The relief force departed on 6 December for Scotland but due to poor weather was largely driven onto sandbanks in Zeeland. Elbeuf himself departed from Calais on 21 December but the wind forced him to return to French port. Elbeuf therefore established himself at Dieppe on 5 January in preparations for a new attempt at departure. He stayed there for two months, during which Protestantism was strictly prohibited in the city. When he departed in March for Scotland services and psalm singing resumed in Dieppe.\nWith France demonstrating itself as hostile to her regime, Elizabeth I moved to blockade Leith. She further entered into an alliance with the Protestant Scottish rebel Lords of the Congregation at Berwick on 27 February 1560. \n\nOn 2 April, Lorraine wrote to his sister Marie de Lorraine, urging her to allow the Protestant rebels to live in peace, as long as they agreed not to challenge the authority of François and Marie Stuart. The bishop of Valence was dispatched to London to inform the English that Marie Stuart would renounce her claim to the English throne, but this concession came too late, the English had already sent 6,000 soldiers to support the Lords of the Congregation. The bombardment of Leith continued.\nA second departure was scheduled for May 1560, this time featuring more local notables, among them the governor of Normandie, the duc de Bouillon; the bailli (baillif) of Rouen and the duc d'Aumale. Coligny meanwhile held a war council in Le Havre on 20 June with the various naval captains. He hoped to redirect the energy of marauding bands of French companies outwards to the foreign project. The captains informed him the troops did not want depart and there were insufficient ships to participate. D'Andelot who was stationed in Marseille refused to embark his ships with his men leading to other captains imitating his example. Peace would be made before the expedition could depart in July, shortly after the death of Marie de Lorraine. The peace was largely forced on the Lorraine administration by domestic affairs. France was now both too unstable and too poor to undertake the expedition. As a result, French influence in Scotland collapsed along with the termination of the Auld Alliance. French troops evacuated Scotland and Marie Stuart agreed to renounce her coat of arms, though this did not come to pass.\nFrance enjoyed difficult relations with Portugal during this period. The presence of a French colony at Villegagnon greatly aggrieved the Portuguese. Matters reached a head in March 1560 when the Portuguese destroyed Forte Coligny in Brasil. Keen to smooth relations over after this violent episode a proposal for marriage between the king's sister Marguerite and the Portuguese king Sebastião was floated, though Lorraine was keen to reserve Marguerite for a Spanish match.\n\n\n== Collapse of order ==\nOn 15 November 1559, the English ambassador reported that the king abandoned his hunt after becoming aware of a rumour of a conspiracy against the crown. His Garde Écossaise (Scots Guard) was issued mail to wear and pistols.\nLorraine found himself increasingly fearful of being assassinated as 1559 came to a close. Indeed, in January 1560 individuals with such nefarious motives infiltrated the court while it stayed at Blois though nothing came of it.\nWith the government increasingly aware of the fraught situation in the kingdom, it was decided that in the spring of 1560 the court would conduct a tour of the kingdom, visiting those parts of it most greatly troubled by disorder (into Guyenne passing through Poitiers, Bordeaux, Bayonne, then onto Languedoc and Provence). The king would be able to demonstrate his authority, and illustrate that the Lorraine brothers were his advisors and not regents. However, before the tour could truly begin a conspiracy would strike against the crown forcing its cancellation.\nThe situation in Paris was poor enough that during February 1560, Coligny was charged with making his entrance to the city prior to the king's, so that he might soothe the people.\n\n\n=== Conspiracy of Amboise ===\n\nA Protestant conspiracy was devised between various malcontent gentleman, the chief architect of which was a certain Périgord gentleman named the sieur de La Renaudie. To provide the conspiracy legitimacy, it operated under the auspices of a prince du sang, Condé, distant cousin of the king. While the premier prince du sang, Navarre had been desired for the initiative by its devisers he remained aloof. The depth of Condé's involvement is a matter of academic dispute. He would operate from the shadows while the leadership of the conspiracy was taken by La Renaudie. Holt describes him as 'clearly endorsing' the plot. Jouanna argues that he clearly knew of the conspiracy and approved of it, but had little involvement in it beyond this. Durot takes the position that while evidence of his involvement is lacking, it was apparent that he was aware of it and did not bother to inform the king - he was therefore guilty for the Lorraine government by this fact alone.\nJean Calvin was also approached with informed about the planned conspiracy, and provided his tacit support, though he wished for any such resistance movement to be led by the premier prince du sang (Navarre). In a letter he wrote on 23 March, before he was aware of the failure of the conspiracy, he described it as a 'magnificent effort' that would bring about the 'extermination of Antoine' (by which is meant Guise). According to Crouzet his approach was 'wait and see', the conspiracies success would prove god favoured it, and if it failed it was a folly. Théodore de Bèze, Calvin's right-hand man was more bombastic in his support, and provided an approving psalm to La Renaudie. De Bèze also aided in the distribution of a tract in support of the rebellion. La Renaudie visited Genève for a recruitment drive for the conspiracy in December, and informed those who he recruited of Calvin's secret approval for the coup. He had considerable success among the exiled French nobility, with the sieur de Villemongis, and the sieur de Compeys agreeing to participate among around 60 other nobles who were in the city.\nThe conspirators also looked abroad to both queen Elizabeth of England, and the kurfürst von der Pfalz (elector of the Pfalz), however neither would offer material support.\nThe Protestant church at large in France remained largely uninvolved. Aside from some churches in Provence, that of Lyon and Paris, most refused to contribute. For example, the Protestant church of Nîmes which was approached declined the proposal. On 21 February in Provence representatives met from sixty churches at Mérindol and declared the Protestant seigneur de Mauvans their military head to lead an army of around 2,000 men. One hundred volunteers were directed north to join with La Renaudie. Mauvans soldiers would first attack Pertuis and then the 'strategic location' of Durance.\nThe Protestant pastors La Roche Chandieu and Boisnormand were heavily involved. La Renaudie also hired mercenaries for the coup. Some nobles of significance were involved, at the head of whom La Renaudie himself was a rich noble of an ancient Périgourdin lineage whose brother in law the sieur de Buy, an échevin (alderman) of Metz had been executed by the Lorraine administration after he had gone to the Empire to find support of the Lutheran German princes for the Protestant community of Metz and the political ambitions of the king of Navarre. Around La Renaudie were the baron de Tursan whose family traced its roots back to the 12th century and who boasted relations with the queen of Navarre; captain Mazères a Béarnais noble who also had ties to the Albret family of whom the queen of Navarre was a member; the seigneur de Maligny and Maligny 'le jeune' (the young), two Burgundian gentleman in the Bourbon network (and first cousins of the vidame de Chartres) ; captain Cocqueville, a client of Condé's from the Picard nobility and the baron de Rauny who leant his château de Noizay, only 5 km away from the royal residence of Amboise for the shelter of the conspirators. Many exiles who were residing in Genève threw themselves in with the plot, among them La Renaudie's chief lieutenant the sieur de Villemongis.\nSome of the conspirators hoped that they would be permitted to approach the king and present their confession of faith. Others hoped to reason with the king as to his administration. In response to their pleas he would dismiss the Lorraine brothers, after which the two men could be put on trial. Some historians, such as Kingdon argue that the conspiracy planned not a trial for the Guise, but rather their assassination. Durot notes that the conspiracies failure possibly saved their lives. An Estates General would be summoned, and Protestantism legalised. If necessary the king would be kidnapped or even deposed if he failed to adopt the Protestant faith. The Estates General would be justified in meeting on the grounds that the king was too young to rule alone.\nIn the discourses of literature theorists supported this argument, which ignored the king being of legal age to rule by dividing the onset of adulthood into two periods, the first of which had ended at fourteen, the second of which lasted until the king was twenty five. By this logic while the signature of the king was valid, he could not reasonably assess those who were to govern in his name. Those who argued the matter also looked back to the reign of Charles VI who was declared king while he was still 11, but was governed for by his uncles until he was 20. The Lorraine government responded to this ideological angle with a request for one of their protégés (Du Tillet) to respond in kind. Du Tillet therefore wrote a treatise entitled 'Pour la majorité du roy très chrestien contre les escrits des rebelles' (For the majority of the most Christian king against the writings of the rebels). This work cited the ordinance of 1403 but also pushed further in arguing that the king was fully invested in his authority at the moment of the death of his predecessor and regencies were thus unnecessary for a king of any age. It was important for the administration that Guise and Lorraine did not personally create the argument as that would be to concede the point to their detractors. Du Tillet in turn was subject to attack as someone in the pay of the Guise, counter examples such as the Estates General of 1484 were presented to those he had provided.\nIf there was resistance to the coup, the conspirators would bring weapons to use against Guise. The conspirators met in Nantes in February 1560 and affirmed the purpose of their forthcoming coup, this meeting was to take the place of an Estates General, which they lacked the powers at present to convene. La Renaudie opened the gathering with a reminder of the various injustices the Lorraine brothers had inflicted upon the kingdom. La Renaudie's leadership was affirmed, with his right to raise an army established. An oath was sworn in favour of the chef muet (silent leader) of the conspiracy. Such an oath was a tradition of German landsknechts. The meeting of so many nobles was able to transpire without suspicion as there had recently been a marriage in the city of Nantes which attracted many nobles. With the meeting concluded La Renaudie went to Paris to meet with Condé and raise more men for the coup.\nWord reached the Lorraine government of this plot, betrayed to them by a Parisian lawyer named des Avenelles who had stayed with La Renaudie in Paris. He confessed to being uneasy to what he overheard, but was soon granted a gift of 10,000 livres by the government for his troubles. The government had some scepticism of what they were told by des Avenelles but the details were confirmed by a client of the duc de Nevers whose brother was involved in the plot.\nCatherine took the moment of this conspiracy to express her frustrations at the policy that had been followed so far by the government. Lorraine was taken aback, and offered her his resignation, however she refused it.\nThe court quickly relocated from Blois to the more defensible château d'Amboise. The wearing of long coats and wide boots was prohibited by Guise at this time for fear that they could conceal weapons. The ducs d'Aumale, Nevers and Nemours, the marshal de Saint-André and the  marquis d'Elbeuf took to forming a protective ring around the person of the king during this period of danger. Guise followed suit and took to employing an Italian guard for his protection. The chevaliers de l'ordre de Saint-Michel (knights of the order of Saint-Michel) and gentilhomme de la chambre du roi (gentleman of the king's chamber) were ordered to lodge and sleep in the château with the king. The Lorraine's invited the nephews of Montmorency to Amboise: Admiral Coligny, the cardinal de Châtillon and D'Andelot. Coligny attended the court only reluctantly, keen to focus on combatting the English queens designs on Scotland, he was therefore keen to be released so he could travel to Normandie. By this means the Lorraine brothers hoped to ensure the separation of the Montmorency and the Bourbons. At Amboise, Coligny protested the poor treatment the administration had shown his uncle Montmorency. Condé, whose involvement in the conspiracy the Lorraine brothers suspected, was also invited, and he arrived around 14 March to participate in the defence of Amboise. \n\nAmboise was then put on siege footing. The conspirators, who had assembled in the woods around Amboise were captured from 16 to 20 March. Many of those captured were simple artisans, who posed little threat to the court, therefore prisoners such as these were released soon after their capture, some given a crown by the king. The initial arrests were conducted with little violence, causing the Spanish ambassador to remark with shock that they surrendered like they were children or sheep. On 14 March a skirmish between royal forces and the rebels transpired in Tours. The assault launched on the château d'Amboise proper on 17 March by 200 men, among them Maligny le jeune, Bertrand de Chaidue and captain Cocqueville was bloodily repulsed by Guise personally. Condé could do little but watch the failed attack from the battlements. La Renaudie himself was killed in a minor skirmish a few days later on 19 March. His body was brought to Amboise where it was dismembered and displayed. The attack on the château on 17 March led to the court responding with summary hangings with the bodies displayed from the walls of the château. Others were cut down where they had assembled or drowned in the Loire. The executions for the crime of lèse majesté were an opportunity for dramatisations, as later illustrated famously with the retellings that the sieur de Villemongis dipped his hands in the blood of his deceased companions and called out 'lord, this is the blood of your children, you will avenge them' before he was executed. Condé attended all the executions and he made sure not to betray any emotions concerning the events. D'Andelot by contrast protested the bloody suppression of the conspiracy.\nGuise dispatched loyal captains and seigneurs to ensure the preservation of nearby Orléans, Blois, Angers, Tours and Bourges. The comte de Sancerre who was entrusted with the security of Tours came up against the baron de Castelnau on 14 March, and was forced to retreat. Castelnau did not exploit this moment of advantage and slipped away. Sancerre was able to arrest five men in Tours, and brought them back to Amboise. On 15 March Marshal Saint-André was tasked with returning to Tours with 200 horseman. Along with him came the duc de Nemours, and the duc d'Aumale (brother of Guise). There was another violent confrontation at Tours on 17 March. Marshal Thermes were sent to Blois, while Marshal Vielleville made towards Orléans and the duc de Montpensier made his way to Angers. The seigneur de La Rochefoucauld went to Bourges and the lieutenant-general of Guyenne, Burie was despatched to Poitiers. At Blois a cache of weapons was uncovered.\nA letter was sent to the sénéschal (seneschal) of Lyon instructing him to let it be known that any who had associated with the conspiracy and who now wished to come forth and inform the government of what they knew would be granted a complete amnesty, but any who continued after an eight-day period to be involved in the conspiracy would be declared guilty of lèse majesté.\nThe duc de Nemours was responsible for the capture of Mazères and Raunay. He then intercepted a band approaching from the south from the château de Noizay. He promised them that he would see that they receive an audience with the king. They would instead be taken to Amboise and tortured. Among those who he intercepted was the baron de Castelnau who was executed after a short trial. Nemours protested to chancellor Olivier that he had been made to dishonour his word, to which Olivier replied that the king was not bound by promises made to rebels. Castelnau was a particularly prominent participant in the conspiracy - his father had been a chambellan du roi (king's chamberlain) and an advisor to the king's council during the reign of Louis XII. He was executed despite the protestations of the Châtillon, the duc d'Aumale, duchesse de Guise and Catherine, who pled for the life of Castelnau and several other prisoners.\n\n\n=== Aftermath of the conspiracy ===\n\nThe failed conspiracy cemented the impression in the minds of many Catholics that Protestantism and sedition were one and the same. Meanwhile, Protestant polemics denounced the tyranny of the Lorraine government. This was most famously embodied in the pamphlet of François Hotman titled 'Le Tigre' which decried the cardinal de Lorraine as a \"venomous viper\" who was abusing the \"youth of our king\". The pamphlet further laid at the feet of Lorraine all the troubles that had befallen the kingdom under Henri II's reign, from the wars to the intrigues of Diane. A printer found to be in possession of the pamphlet in Paris was executed. Other Protestant pamphlets sought to illustrate the purely political nature of the conspiracy, separating it from their religion. In their efforts to combat the upswell of Protestant pamphleteers that emerged after the conspiracy of Amboise, the government was continually frustrated as they found the addresses of the printers were often false on the pamphlets, this made it difficult to get at the printers. Protestant polemics also began to address François himself in the hope that he was now approaching an age at which he might 'emancipate himself from the tutelage of the Lorraine brothers'.\nOn La Renaudie's secretary, La Bigne were found two documents, one a confession of faith to be presented to the king, the other was titled Les États de France opprimés par la tyrannie de Guise, au Roi leur Souverain Seigneur (The Estates of France oppressed by the tyranny of the Guise to their sovereign lord the king). This text was largely political in character, stating that although there were some in the conspiracy who were Protestant, it was only the political injustices that had driven them to rise up. It was intended that this document be presented to the king. Guise and Lorraine were aware that the conspiracy was largely focused on their government, however by the end of March the official narrative was that the king himself was at risk of being murdered had the conspiracy succeeded. The notion of regicide was not overemphasised however due to fear it might actually inspire a desire to commit such an act in addition to the fact it would be a difficult narrative to maintain.\nGuise was establish as lieutenant-general of the kingdom by François to better enable him to combat the crisis. The historian Garrisson argues that the Conspiracy of Amboise should not be seen as an isolated conspiracy, but the first event that can be considered a blow of the Religious Wars. Tortured prisoners implicated Condé in the conspiracy. Condé's suspected involvement in the Conspiracy of Amboise led to his disgrace. The 70,000 livres he had been granted by the king the prior year was not delivered. The suspicion of his guilt had only been furthered by the role of one of his écuyers (squires) in the escape from captivity of Maligny. Condé was forbidden to leave court without the king's permission. Similar prohibitions were given to the Châtillon brothers and the sieur de Soubise.\nCondé indignantly protested his innocence in front of the king's council, the ducs and peers of the realm and the chevaliers (knights) of the Ordre de Saint-Michel (Order of Saint-Michel) on 2 April. During his denouncement of the 'wickedly and cowardly lies' that were levelled against him, the cardinal de Lorraine kept his eyes affixed on the ground. He denounced his accusers as liars, the worst insult a noble could make against another. Any challenge to Condé after this would be an invitation to a duel (a matter in which Condé informed the council he would renounce his privileges as a prince du sang). Guise assured him that the king was pleased to hear of his innocence. Guise further promised that if someone dared to accuse him, that he would serve the prince as his second in the subsequent duel. Nevertheless, Condé's residence was ransacked and searched for evidence of his complicity on 18 April, but without result. His brother's secretary, who was present in the capital was searched for evidence that might prove Bourbon complicity.\nCondé was able to leave court a free man and after initially retreating to La Ferté-sous-Jouarre took refuge with Navarre in their southern court of Nérac, far away from the court. On route south, he met with the elder Maligny brother in Poitiers. Navarre was moved to support his brother (now convinced there was a great deal of discontent among the nobility), and engaged in dialogue with the Protestant queen Elizabeth of England and German princes in the hopes of securing military support. Navarre looked to the Schmalkaldischer Bund (Schmalkadischer league) for support in May. In June the firebrand Protestant polemicist, François Hotman fresh off writing his denunciation of Lorraine ('Le Tigre'), also travelled to Nérac to meet with Condé. On 20 July Calvin's right-hand man De Bèze was dispatched to Nérac at Navarre's request, and may have secured the conversion to Protestantism of Jeanne d'Albret, the queen of Navarre during his stay. De Bèze stayed at court with Navarre for three months. Benedict argues that de Bèze and Calvin were jointly working on funding the raising of troops for Navarre, so that he could be persuaded to assert his right to the government. Despite the plotting, Navarre also offered the services of 5,000 men to the crown for the protection of François against rebels. Instead of accepting this offer, François asked for the imprisonment of Navarre's Protestant ministers (David and Boisnormand), only to be informed by the prince that they were no longer in his service, but that he would arrest them if they returned to Nérac. When Boisnormand returned in June, rather than arresting him, Navarre accepted him back into his service.\nMontmorency's nephew d'Andelot was also suspected of involvement in the conspiracy, and he responded by retreating to Bretagne. In Crété's estimation, d'Andelot would not have involved himself without the assent of his brother Coligny, and Coligny disapproved of the disorder of conspiracy, preferring legal avenues to challenge the Guise.\nMontmorency was the first to be informed of the conspiracy by the government after the crown became aware of what was planned. He was asked to hand over several prisoners from Vincennes, but was not instructed to come to Amboise. Guise was confident that the Constable was not involved in the conspiracy and did not want him to overshadow them in Amboise. The Constable joined his eldest son Marshal de Montmorency in leading the effort to combat any moves in support of the conspiracy emerging in Paris. They oversaw house to house searches and the expulsion of those who did not reside in the city. Aside from a few weapons the searches did not yield any results. Indeed, the main effect of their security measures, was to excite the fears of Catholic Parisians. Despite their participation in the suppression, when reporting to the parlement of Paris on the conspiracy, Montmorency characterised it as an effort against the king's ministers, as opposed to an attack on the king himself. In response to his explanation of what was transpiring the parlement granted Guise the honorary title of conservateur de la patrie on 28 March.\nBeginning on 10 March 1560, the Protestants held their second national synod, at Poitiers.  The meeting made preparations for political action at an upcoming estates general, and challenged the rights of the Lorraine family to govern. As far as confessional matters were concerned it was agreed Protestant  marriage between first cousins should not be prohibited, as it was not a 'biblical prohibition' but rather one that derived from magistrates, thus scripture was elevated above secular law. It was further decided that each province was to have a representative at the court to represent their interests, and present the crown with a confession of faith. It was agreed that obedience of royal religious edicts would be left up to the discretion of the individual Protestant pastor.\nThis synod represented an innovation on Protestant strategy, that could now look to the possibility of direct pressure and influence on the crown, as opposed to the only mechanism of expression deriving from conspiracy and foreign diplomatic pressure.\nOn 27 March 1560 the aged chancellor of France Olivier died.\nIn Paris after a sermon in the church of Saint-Innocents a suspected 'Lutheran' had their throat cut.\n\n\n=== New religious policy ===\n\nAt this time the crown began to adopt a new policy as regarded the Protestants of the kingdom. The first manifestation of this, the Edict of Amboise was issued on 2 March. It made a distinction for the first time between the crimes of heresy and sedition. Religious prisoners were also to be released on the condition they lived as good Catholics henceforth. Those who had taken up arms and conspired against the king or state, had attempted to free other prisoners by force or who were pastors were excluded from enjoying release. The edict was justified on the grounds that François did not wish to begin his reign with bloodshed. It was signed by the cardinals de Lorraine, Bourbon and Châtillon the ducs de Guise, Nevers, Aumale and Montpensier and the seigneurs de Saint-André and Coligny alongside the secrétaire l'Aubespine. This edict pre-dated the conspiracy proper, though the court had already moved to Amboise for its security. With this edict, de facto tacit toleration of private worship was granted. Catherine ensured the edict would be quickly registered by the parlement, despatching the secrétaire des finances Jacques de Moroges to ensure that it transpired in good time. A few days after this edict, the right of petition was granted to the Protestants. The leaders of this about face in royal policy is disputed, some have argued that Catherine or Coligny were its architects. Durot sees February as the time at which Catherine emerges from her period of mourning to take an active political role advocating the new policy. With royal authority weakened she saw the necessity of assuming an active position to protect her son. Other historians, such as Le Roux have argued that in fact the Cardinal de Lorraine was the author of the shift in royal policy. Indeed, Lorraine wrote to the Pope soon after the conspiracy on 22 March arguing that if a general council of the church could not be called soon to reform the Catholic church then cardinal de Tournon should be dispatched with legate powers to hold a national council to revitalise the French Catholic church, restoring its 'primitive beauty'. The Pope responded by harshly critiquing French religious policy, denouncing the recent pardons of Protestants. Pius chided Lorraine himself as a potential schismatic. Christin argues the effect of the edict was to deny the Protestants the rhetorical position of acting as defenders of tradition and legality against 'foreign tyranny' by separating political protest/sedition from 'heresy'. The radical Protestants would be isolated and the more peaceable majority would cease to be an issue.\nAround this period, a new term became popularised for the Protestants of France, the term 'Huguenot'. This term possibly derives from the term 'eidegenossen' (confederates) a faction in Genevan politics. By the use of the term, the Protestants were linked to Genève, the source of their 'heresy' and 'rebellious inclinations'. An alternate etymology of the name links it 'king Huguet', a mythical lord of the shadows. This was due to the Protestant tendency for meeting in secret at night.\nGuise continued his efforts to buttress the regime against any military challenge. On 31 March he wrote to the parlements, baillages and sénéchaux of the kingdom. He denounced the conspiracy as a detestable treason brought about by those of the 'new doctrine' (Protestants). He raised troops from Lorraine, the Holy Roman Empire and his Gascon bands which were stationed in his governate of Dauphiné. He established garrisons in Orléans, Gien, and Montargis. He distributed royal patronage to reward loyal companions, with seventeen receiving the collar of the Ordre de Saint-Michel. Meanwhile, in Metz, which had been under the administration of Lorraine since 1558, the persecution of Protestantism was redoubled. By the treaty of Edinburgh in July, the Lorraine administration divested itself of its Scottish commitments so that they might focus on domestic troubles.\nDuring spring the estates of the cardinal de Lorraine at Dampierre and Cluny were ransacked by Protestants. Lorraine was also burned in effigy in Paris at the place Maubert. In May the English ambassador reported that there was a plan for six men to assassinate the duc de Guise while he was on a hunting trip. Around this time, Coligny also warned the duchesse de Guise of a plot against her husbands life.\nIn May the liberal religious policy was furthered in two edicts, the first the Edict of Loches, issued sometime between 15 and 24 May. This edict re-iterated the royal forgiveness for religious offences. This edict may not have featured the exclusion clauses that were featured in the pardons of March. The edict also did not stress the future Catholicity of the pardoned heretics in the way that the edict of Amboise did. It is possible that this edict was issued in response to a new Amboise like conspiracy, as the English ambassador reports the gathering of around 6,000 men in Romorantin, near where the court was staying in Loches on 19 May. Some of them had escaped from prison in Tours. The more substantial Edict of Romorantin followed in thee same month. It voided the rights of royal courts to oversee trials of Protestants, which were now to be the purview of ecclesiastical courts. Ecclesiastical courts did not have the power to impose the death penalty. Thus the death penalty for heresy alone was effectively abolished, unless the ecclesiastical court referred the case to the parlement for the purpose of the sentence. Catholic priests were encouraged to draw back Protestants to the faith through persuasion and by living model lives as examples. This included urgings for bishops to reside in their diocese. By this means, the situation for the prosecution of 'heresy' reverted to how it had been at the time of the 1535 edict of Coucy. It was re-affirmed however that illicit assemblies remained prohibited. Seditious assemblies and violent demonstrations now became the purview of the présidiaux courts. Liberty of conscience was implied by the edict without being stated. The parlement resisted registration of the new edict, remonstrating with the crown that it was not right to remove competency for such cases from the king's justices, this caused a delay of two months in registration with the edict being approved on 16 July. In September L'Hôpital argued with président Le Maistre in the parlement of Paris about the courts approach to matters of heresy, charging the court with encouraging seditions which Le Maistre denied. The parlementaire retorted by observing that several important offices of the crown were held by Protestants.  The edict would largely be a dead letter, left unenforced by the authorities it was entrusted to.\nCatherine was again approached by Protestants on 24 May. They protested in a written remonstrance that the amnesty measures of the previous months had not in fact been applied to 'gentleman of good faith' who had withdrawn themselves from the Amboise coup and yet were still subject to execution. Catherine was approached while reading the remonstrance by Marie Stuart, who informed the Lorraine government of the matter. Catherine therefore sacrificed the bearer of the remonstrance to imprisonment, while maintaining contact covertly. During June she spoke with La Planche, an advisor to Montmorency's eldest son. He informed her that there were two types of Protestants, religious and political. The latter of whom desired the establishment of government by the princes du sang. If government was put in their hands, they would fade away, and the religious Protestants would be soothed.\nIn July, Catherine dispatched Coligny to investigate the religious situation in Normandie. By this means, Catherine sought to show the Lorraine government that it was not only matters of religion that motivated the discord that was shaking the kingdom.\n\n\n=== Rebellion and sedition ===\nFrançois for his part was humiliated by the attempted coup, and announced that it was his intention to establish his authority as king over the rebels. In the south of France, in Dauphiné, Provence and Guyenne, men rose up in arms in various disorders after the failure of Amboise. Towns and villages were seized by the Protestants. The disorders that followed Amboise lead to the historian Brunet putting the start of the wars of religion in March 1560, at least for the south of France. The historian Crouzet describes the period beyond Amboise as the 'civil war before the wars of religion'. Greengrass sees a move from 'localised militancy' to a 'sustained militant insurrection' between 1560 and 1562. In the seized towns, the Protestants modelled their administration on that of the independent city states like Genève. In Provence the Protestant rebels were led by the seigneur de Mauvans (whose brother Antoine had been killed in 1559 at Draguignan), in Dauphiné by captain Montbrun, Maligny would be involved in a plot at Lyon, in Languedoc Ardoine de Maillan had led the conspirators, and the seigneur de Duras operated in Gascogne. In September, the Ferrarese ambassador reported that there were troop build ups in Hainaut, Normandie, Guyenne and Dauphiné.\nAround Saint-Lô peasants refused to pay their dîme (tithes) to the Catholic church. the seigneur de Monluc reports similar refusals in Guyenne. Such refusals are also attested around Nîmes and in Saintonge. This refusal could be seen across the bounds of religion. Heller notes that in the period of the civil wars it is as visible in the Catholic peasantry of the Biterrois as it was among the Protestant peasants of the Cévennes.\nGovernors across the south and west of France reported that Protestants were worshipping publicly in services attended by hundreds or even thousands of worshippers. The lieutenant-general of Languedoc protested to the crown that they approached financially vulnerable nobles offering them money to become their protectors. The seigneur de Monluc claimed to have been approached with such offers three times, with sums totalling 120,000 livres.\n\n\n==== Normandie ====\n\nThe king ordered the governor of Normandie to travel to his governate in October so that he might suppress all disorders and see to the punishments of those responsible.\nA Protestant church had been established in Dieppe and in October the governor of Normandie the duc de Bouillon oversaw its dismantling. He also replaced the captain of Dieppe, a Protestant client of Coligny's. However, Bouillon would allow the Protestant community of Dieppe to continue meeting in private. The governor understood the government was happy to ignore Protestants who did not disturb the public peace.\nWhen a confession of faith was presented by the Protestants of Dieppe, Le Havre and Rouen, the document was set alight in front of the cathedral of Rouen on 12 June.\nCatholic partisans were not adverse to violence in Rouen. The day after the burning of the confession of faith, the failure of the Protestants to put up the proper draping on their houses for Corpus Christi Day provoked a Catholic riot, the non-decorated houses subject to looting and other attacks. Protestants responded to the riot with a display of force, 2,000 of their number marching to the parlement for justice. The bailli of Rouen, the sieur de Villebon responded to this in turn with a march of his own in which he made his wish for Catholic ceremony to be observed clear. Villebon's fundamentalist attitude earned him rebuke from Lorraine who argued this approach to governing (with 'too much zeal') was putting the stability of the crown in danger. In August another riot followed in the city in retribution for Protestant interruptions of a sermon, with several casualties.\n\n\n==== Bretagne ====\n\nSuspecting that Maligny had taken refuge in Bretagne with the hope of making his way across to England, Guise wrote to the governor of the province, the duc d'Étampes that no service he could perform could be greater than apprehending Maligny.\nIn May, Protestant gentleman and churchmen gathered at La Fonchaye to enter into a league to support one another with their 'goods and persons'.\nIn the panicked letters sent by the governor of Bretagne to Guise at court, the governor reported on his concerns regarding England. On 16 June he announced that the English were assembling a force across the channel and that he could not see the only target of their force being Scotland. He therefore requested of the court more money for coastal defences. These warnings become more insistent in another letter on 20 July in which Étampes claimed that the English enterprise would soon be unleashed, and this was known to all, therefore it was imperative Bretagne be secured. By contrast, Étampes noted that domestically there was little cause for concern in or around the province.\nThere would be a riot against Protestantism in Rennes.\n\n\n==== Orléanais and Poitou ====\nIn further concerning developments in central France, both Orléans and Poitiers would be threatened by groups of armed men during September and October. Villars reported groups of armed men marching through Auvergne and the mountains of the Forez towards Poitiers in October. Around 100 armed horseman were spotted in the area arousing the fury of François. He further reported, on 21 October, that there were around 1,100 soldiers in the Vivarais who bragged that they would induce an even bigger rebellion than those of Amboise and Lyon.\nAfter a tense meeting at court on 5 October a contingent of troops was moved into Poitiers for the security of the city.\nA contested burial in Niort saw a group of 800 armed Protestants exhume a body which had been buried in the Catholic fashion so that they might bury it in the Protestant style while ringing the bells of the city. The lieutenant-general of Poitou the comte du Lude protested to Guise about this 'travesty of justice'.\n\n\n==== Anjou ====\nIn Angers, a group of Protestant nobles took the lead in establishing a cache of weapons such that the celebrations of the last supper would resemble a military watch. A former associate of La Renaudie, La Chesnaye undertook various disorders across Anjou with a band of rebels. During October Montpensier busied himself repressing the Protestants of the city.\n\n\n==== Touraine ====\nDuring October, the prisons of Tours and Amboise were both stormed, with those imprisoned in them on account of their religion forcibly released. Tours (along with Orléans) would reject the imposition of royal compagnies d'ordonnance at the instigation of the Bourbon princes.\n\n\n==== Aunis ====\n\nThe governor of La Rochelle, the baron de Jarnac reported in September that ministers were working the countryside convincing people to disobey the king, and were planning on a meeting towards the end of the month at which they would carry out their illicit intentions.\n\n\n==== Guyenne ====\nIn Bordeaux there was vicious factional conflict between two street troupes, named the 'basoche' and the 'écoliers' , the former composed of young parlementaires while the latter comprised students of the collėge de Guyenne. By the 1550s hatred between them had become religious in character, with the humanism of the collège de Guyenne establishing a Protestant character among the écoliers while the basoche became the defenders of Catholic orthodoxy. By 1559 both groups patrolled the city in gangs, engaging in armed skirmishes. In May 1560 a group of écoliers on route to disrupt a Catholic service were intercepted by the city guard. However, they outnumbered the guard and in the fight that followed the guard required the support of the garrison of the château du Hâ, who were able to limit their casualties. After this clash, the parlement banned the écoliers from assembling in front of the collège de Guyenne. The collège however enjoyed the patronage of Navarre, who reacted furiously to the decision, and forced the rescinding of the measure against the écoliers. In the parlement a compromise was reached by which the écoliers would have their censuring reviewed, in return for the investigation of Protestant assemblies in the city.\nIn the wake of these troubles between May and September the crown sanctioned the deployment of parlementaire lawyers to support the city guard. The lieutenant of Bordeaux the comte d'Escars wished to take this royal directive further and make the town guard responsible for the walls and gates Catholic only. He was opposed in this by the lieutenant-general of Guyenne the seigneur de Burie who thought such a sectarian militia would be compromising. Burie's moderation aroused the indignation of some radical Catholics who complained to the crown that he was incompetent and failing to take the appropriate steps to protect the province. Burie appealed to Catherine in turn defending his services and asking that the author of the complaint against him be detained.\nDuring June, it was reported that the nephew of the executed baron de Castelnau had raised 100 men to avenge the death of his uncle, with instructions for each of the hundred to raise a hundred in turn. A memorandum produced by an agent of the crown stated that the capital of the duché d'Albret (Nérac) was the nucleus for efforts to recruit soldiers throughout the spring and summer. These men were to rendezvous at Poitiers on 11 November. It was desired that any action be delayed until such time as the Pyrénées were impassable from snow, to inhibit España coming to the aid of the French crown.\n\n\n==== Languedoc ====\n\nIn Languedoc, the lieutenant-general, the vicomte de Joyeuse reported on 5 September that there were 1,200 deserters from royal service terrorising the countryside from a base in the mountains of the Velay and Gévaudan. Their bands assaulted churches, and destroyed the material artefacts of Catholicism. According to Joyeuse they were on their way to Lyon. Three days later he added that a further 800–1,000 armed men had departed from Montpellier and Nîmes, while 300 were lurking around Valvignères. There was dispute as to their destination, be it Lyon the court or to confront La Motte-Gondrin. Between 19 and 21 October around Montpellier sixty churches were destroyed and many Catholics killed.\nThe number of Protestants in Toulouse had reached the point by 1560 that the parlement of the city felt it necessary to establish a chambre extraordinaire (extraordinary chamber) for their prosecution to clear the backlog of cases. The Catholic dominated parlement, sénéchaussée and vigurie (two lesser courts responsible for policing and security) clashed with the Protestant aligned capitouls that represented the civic government of Toulouse. The présidial court took a moderate Catholic line and therefore clashed with the parlement of the city.\nThe university of Toulouse proved a centre for militant Protestantism, organising itself into bands with captains which gave it the character of a militia. Through 1560 armed bands of students roamed the streets of the city, disrupting Catholic services and attacking property. They were confronted by the 'basoche' (actors and musicians who performed for Catholic ceremonies) and members of the confraternities. The basoche led attacks on the Protestants in the streets and made sure to report every Protestant transgression to the authorities so that they might install more repressive measures.\nNo sooner had the edict of Amboise been issued than public Protestant worship began in Nîmes. The consuls were sympathetic (or converted) to Protestantism but unwilling to tolerate public preaching that violated the law. The présidial court announced that illicit assemblies and bearing arms were prohibited. The court wrote to the lieutenant-general of Languedoc the vicomte de Joyeuse asking for him to aid them. Joyeuse arrived on 24 April and demanded an account of affairs from the présidial court. He further announced it was his intention to put an end to the carrying of arms and illegal assemblies. Joyeuse then wrote to the king expressing his dissatisfaction at both the Nîmois court and the town council. On 20 May the présidial met and issued arrest warrants for a list of Protestants, however word got out and all the named parties fled. Joyeuse congratulated the city for the action, while the Constable de Montmorency (the governor of Languedoc) wrote that he was considering imposing a garrison on the city for the failures of the arrest warrants to be successfully executed.\nAfter Romorantin, the attitude of the elite of Nîmes to Protestantism again liberalised. Public preaching began once more. Rumours began to swirl that a royal garrison was to be imposed on Nîmes and the council wrote apprehensively about the prospect to the duc de Guise who responded evasively. The council and présidial court began nervously pointing the finger at each other as to whose responsibility it was to lead the repression of 'heresy', hoping to avert the imposition of a royal garrison. During September, several hundred Protestants marched out of the city under the command of a lawyer named Guillaume de Sauzet according to the lieutenant-general Joyeuse. That same month the council agreed to write to Joyeuse, informing him of the situation in the city. The letter was generous to the Protestants, letting Joyeuse know they had not been causing seditions. Joyeuse wrote back disapprovingly, chiding Nîmes' council for their liberal position, informing them 400 soldiers were on their way to restore order. This only furthered the defiance of Nîmes, the council going as far as to write to Joyeuse that the level of disorders had actually decreased in the city as Protestantism grew. Nevertheless, as the military presence in the province grew, the council conceded to the pressure on 22 October and made a new declaration against illegal assemblies. The vicomte de Cheylane arrived as the new governor, it became apparent to him the council was actively resisting his efforts.\nThe marquis de Villars menaced the countryside around Nîmes with bloody destruction and caused many families to take refuge in the mountains and woods. In writing to Montmorency, Villars identified two nobles that he identified as responsible for the troubles of the province (the seigneur de Saint-Jean de Gardonnenque and the sieur de Cardet). These men were associated with the comte de Crussol.\nOn 23 November, the deputy to the bishop of Nîmes devised a plan to bring Nîmes into line. A special election to replace the consuls would be held with only Catholics permitted to vote. The new governor the vicomte de Cheylane was pleased at this plan and happy to support its execution. While in the short term a more agreeable council was produced, it allowed the Protestant opposition to portray the crown as tyrannically overstepping urban privileges.\nGaillac would bear witness to an anti-Protestant riot.\nDuring the summer of 1560, the Protestants seized the church of Saint-Jacques in Montauban.\nMontpellier was seized by rebel Protestants to cries of 'Navarre! Navarre! Liberty! Liberty!', with the Catholic magistrates driven from the city.\nSaint-André was dispatched by Villars to secure Montpellier for the royalists. Saint-André arrived in the city with three companies of infantry on 15 October. Upon his arrival the Protestants fled from Montpellier and the bishop re-emerged. To further the pacification of the province, Villars appointed Saint-André and Cheylane as governors of Nîmes, Montpellier and Aigues-Mortes. The Protestant pastor of Aigues-Mortes was hanged, and those rebel nobles who had departed from the city had their residences razed.\nIn judicial summons the Protestants of Montpellier were accused of various transgressions. Among them was the seizure of the church of Saint-Mathieu, assaulting the gates of the bishops residence, establishing their own night watch, captains and attending public preaching and aiding the attempted seizure of Lyon. A garrison was imposed on the city with a tax imposed on the Protestant households of the city to pay for it.\nDuring February 1560 an insurrection in Montségur led to several weeks of destruction after which the town was left in ruins.\nAlarmed by what was transpiring in nearby Montségur, and the guard was put on high alert in case Protestants attempted to besiege the city, Navarre acceding to the cities request to do this. The seigneur de Monluc was invited to the city in late February and he urged caution from the city grandees. A local teacher was arrested on suspicion of Protestantism, and tried in the city.\nAfter the arrest of two of their preacher in May for inciting attacks on members of the présidial court, the Protestants of Agen took up arms towards his release. It became necessary to deploy the guard around the prison, but both ministers escaped. Monluc led forces to suppress the unrest and affirmed the arrest of the preachers as in line with the king's edicts. In revenge he was besieged in his residence at Estillac by angry Protestants. Navarre was furious at Monluc and the jurade (town council) of Agen for overstepping their authority. The re-arrested minister was transferred to Bordeaux to be tried there.\nIn June, word arrived that a Protestant force from Nérac was approaching with the intent of sacking the cathedral of Agen. Local grandees were summoned to prepare a response. It was agreed to form a military council for their defence, that would surveil Protestant activity in Agen and deploy a militia force in emergencies. Permission was sort from the crown by Monluc, François responded with an ambiguous endorsement of their zeal, without endorsing their coalition, even floating the idea of bi-confessional chambers. The Protestants of Agen took up this idea and began demanding its implementation, attacking churches and Catholic homes to this end.\n\n\n==== Provence ====\nThe seigneur de Mauvans led his forces in Provence on an anti-Papal campaign. He first attempted to besiege Pertuis and when word arrived of the failure of the main Amboise conspiracy he moved to the Durance to achieve juncture with Montbrun. With prices on their heads some of his soldiers began to desert. Meanwhile, the royal lieutenant La Garde visited in turn Sisteron, Manosque, Forcalquier, Pertuis and Mérindol trying to sooth the places of their agitation, and see to the readmittance of Protestants so that they would not join with the rebels outside the walls. Once it became clear L'Hôpital was striking a moderate course, Mauvans began recruiting again, adding 500 Vaudois from Cabrières to his numbers. He sacked Castellane, Entrevaux, Colmars and La Baume-de-Sisteron. By July the possibility of his arrest was becoming increasingly inevitable. Having failed to surprise Sisteron, he was cornered by the governor of Provence, the comte de Tende. He capitulated on the condition of safe conduct for his men, and decided to retire to Castellane with 100 horseman. He therefore dispersed his forces (who would continue to operate without him) and appealed for refuge in Genève on 9 July. This request for refuge was promptly granted, and Mauvans would reside in Genève for an indeterminate time, though he was back in France by 1562.\n\n\n==== Dauphiné ====\nWith the initial disorders in Dauphiné in the spring, Guise the governor of the province, was unsatisfied with the repressive efforts of his lieutenant, Antoine de Clermont, and replaced him with La Motte-Gondrin as lieutenant-general, his own brother the the grand prieur and a force under the seigneur de Maugiron. This force successfully recaptured Valence from the rebels on 20 April and looked to 'punish the rebels of the city' (the parlement overseeing some executions), several Protestant preachers had placards hung round their neck reading 'here is the leader of the rebels' before they were beheaded. The royal army moved on and conducted a contested entry into Montélimar.  The Protestants of Montélimar were disarmed, while others fled into the mountains of the Vivarais. Guise further requested his brother Aumale bring forces into Dauphiné from Bourgogne, this was done by Tavannes in his absence.\nA while later, the seigneur de Maugiron would lead a punitive expedition against the Vaudois of Freissinières and Pragelato.\nThe Protestant rebel leader Montbrun attempted to undertake an invasion of the 'Comtat Venaissin' a Papal territory within the borders of France. In service of this aim he enlisted the support of Protestants from the principality of Orange (a neighbouring independent territory). While in Nyons, Montbrun could count on 300 horseman. A resident of Avignon named Guillotin promised him support in bringing the Comtat Venaissin into the French fold. He was to capture Vaison for Montbrun but he failed. Meanwhile Malaucène was betrayed to the Protestant warlord on 5 August. Montbrun successfully undertook the seizure of several villages, accompanied by a preacher. In each one he established Protestant worship.\nThe royal defence was led by the lieutenant-general La Motte-Gondrin. La Motte-Gondrin had to make do without royal funds to support the suppression of the rebellion. He received a boon when the Papal Legate leant him 12,000 écus d'or (gold crowns). He marched on Bollène where he waited for support from Papal troops. Together they approach Orange with 4,500 men and secure the city, imposing a fine on the grandees of Orange for their support of Montbrun. Moving on from Orange they approached Malaucène but the Protestants had already decamped and were marching northwards. When approached by the baron de Castres, Montbrun opined that his 'superiors' who were of a very great house had instructed them to retire for now. At this time Montbrun and Mauvans were separated, with the latter heading to Draguignan where his brother had been murdered, putting the town to the sword. The baron de La Garde deployed soldiers along the Rhône to ensure there was no linkage established between the rebels being raised in Languedoc and those under Montbrun or Mauvans. Montbrun himself had to take on a disguise as a peasant, and narrowly avoided capture as he fled to take refuge in Genève. As with Mauvans, he would return to France in the future to continue the fight. After his departure, the châteaux de Montbrun and Reilhamette were razed.\nUnlike his contemporary Mauvans, Montbrun conducted his campaign with a fanatic drive towards extermination. Upon capturing Mornas, he slaughtered the Catholic woman and children of the town alongside the garrison.\n\n\n==== Lyonnais ====\n\nLyon was an attractive prize for the Amboise rebels, it was the second city of the kingdom, and its capture before the convening of an Estates General could prove a valuable bargaining chip to impose a settlement on the crown. It would also be a valuable centre for the Protestants of Dauphiné, Bourgogne and the Rhône valley.  According to the Lorraine administration's spies, it was Jean Darut, a merchant of Swiss extraction who was the leader of rebellious plans in the city. According to their spies Darut was in league with the king of Navarre for the capture of Lyon. Montbrun and Mauvans were also party to the plan, hoping it would form the nucleus for their southern project by its capture. This captured southern land would be fortified and then host an 'Estates General' by which the government and religion of the state would be overturned. The intermediary between Navarre and Darut was Maligny, who had been present for the conspiracy of Amboise. He arrived in Lyon in August and was followed by around 500 conspirators by September. The leader of these 500 was a captain Le Peyrault, who awaited the signal to seize the city. Navarre had second thoughts, and urged the conspirators to depart and regroup in Limoges where they could link up with him as he marched north. However, well aware of what was transpiring, the deputy governor of Lyon, Antoine d'Albon, abbot of Savigny (cousin of the marshal) had located an arms depot on the rue Longue and dispatched some arquebusiers to take over the depot. The Protestant rebels bested the arquebusiers, pushing them across to the right bank of the Saône, but lacked orders on how to proceed, and fearing they had been compromised fled in the night on 3 September. The next day the gates of the city were shut and searches undertaken.\nThe deputy governor urged that aid in the preservation of Lyon be given by La Motte-Gondrin and Maugiron (who would bring 300 arquebusiers to the city), the lieutenant-general of Bourgogne Tavannes and the comte de Montréval, lieutenant to the duca di Savoia in Bresse. Savoia's lieutenant brought Savoyard troops to the gates of Lyon. Those conspirators who had stayed behind were captured and hanged, many of them implicating the king of Navarre during interrogation. Two prisoners were of particular note. Gilles Triou who was interrogated on 7 September confessed everything he knew, and his testimony would later be used in the conviction of Condé. The other was a former page of Condé who refused to say anything, but whose presence was viewed as evidence enough. Benedict also argues for the involvement of Calvin and Bèze in the conspiracy, arguing that although for the Genevans it was not an ideal conspiracy, it was still an effort worth financing.\nAfter the arrest of a pair of the Lyon conspirators in Bresse (one of whom was a Genevan), a group of residents of Genève departed the city to make towards Bresse. The council of Genève became panicked that they might engage in violent action that implicated the city in the failed coup in Lyon and sent out orders for their arrests. The council then engaged in negotiations with Bresse, and secured the release of the captives into their custody. François and Guise were enraged against Genève, suspecting the cities role in instigating the troubles in Lyon, Guise therefore proposed to the duca di Savoia that he invade the comté.\nSaint-André arrived in Lyon with 5 compagnies on 20 September, alongside the cardinal de Tournon. The city was obliged to lodge them and the bourgeois of the city were subject to great pressures over the coming months.\n\n\n=== Provincial reconfiguration ===\n\nThe Lorraine administration undertook a large scale consolidation of the interior governates in August 1560. Two super-governates were created. One composed of Anjou, Touraine, Maine, Perche, the Vendômois and Loudun, Blois, Laval and Amboise; the other comprised the Orléanais, Berry, Beauce, Montargis, and Chartres. The former was granted to the prince du sang the duc de Montpensier, the latter to his younger brother the prince de La Roche-sur-Yon. The premier prince du sang Navarre also received elevation, having Poitou folded into his governate of Guyenne as a subordinate governorship. The area had been de facto under the control of the governors of Guyenne since the time of Navarre's father in law. Letters patent to this effect were given to him in late spring. By this means, Guise and his brother hoped to show themselves to their critics as defenders of the rights of the princes du sang, and maintain relations with the group despite freezing the princes out of government. At this time Montpensier under the influence of his wife Jacqueline undertook a policy of moderate Catholicism. After her death he would develop a reputation for militant Catholicism. His lieutenant-general in this grand new charge would be the seigneur de Chauvigny a fidèle of Guise. La Roche-sur-Yon was provided with the sieur de Sipierre as his lieutenant-general, another Guise client who was responsible to him. The lieutenant-generals role was as much to supervise the governors as take orders from them.\nOutside of these super-governates, Limousin was entrusted to the seigneur de Pontbriant and the Angoumois to the seigneur de Sansac. In October Coligny was granted the government of the port towns of Le Havre and Honfleur.\nA further reward for Montpensier came in the form of the return of the final pieces of the Bourbon inheritance that had been seized from the constable de Bourbon in 1523, the Beaujolais and Dombes. The parlement of Paris baulked at this alienation of part of the royal domain but Lorraine pressured them to acquiesce.\nIn the coming year, Montpensier and La Roche-sur-Yon would take very different approaches to the matter of Protestants in their respective governates. La Roche-sur-Yon informed the Protestants of his territories that while he would not tolerate them assembling in public or their bearing of arms, he would not impede their conscience or force them to convert. He urged they contain their passions until such time they made up a large enough segment of the French population. Montpensier by contrast was summoned to court in 1561 for his refusal to release several hundred Protestants he had imprisoned in Chimonais.\n\n\n=== New royal policy ===\nA new chancellor was appointed on 20 June, Michel de l'Hôpital. Though he did not believe that Protestants and Catholicism could co-exist, he was of the understanding that Protestantism had grown to the point where it could not be wiped out without military force. Therefore, the only course to take was to focus the administration on reforming the church and judiciary. The new chancellor was an active thinker on matters of royal power, having recently composed a Latin treatise that took the form of an address to François upon his coronation. According to L'Hôpital the good king was one who, like Christ, was a 'prince of peace' who did not seek to shed either his own peoples or other peoples blood. L'Hôpital looked to god to be the architect of the reunification of the French church. Disconcerted by the violent opposition of Amboise, the Lorraine government assented to L'Hôpital replacing the recently deceased Olivier. Indeed, L'Hôpital owed his entry to the conseil privé to the patronage of Lorraine.  Alongside the support of the Lorraine brothers he enjoyed Catherine's support, the queen mother seeing him as a moderate figure who was qualified for the position. In L'Hôpital's estimation it was god himself who had caused the king to remember him and afford him the office of chancellor. The Lorraine administration rewarded him in July with 10,000 livres so that he could buy suitable amenities for his new dignity.\nSaint-André travelled south into Gascogne some time during July, nominally to spend some time in his lands there, but in fact so that he might spy on the Bourbons.\nBy a royal declaration on 6 August the parlement of Paris was allowed to hear cases on matters of illicit assemblies that had until this point been the purview of the présidial courts. By this means it was hoped to better establish public order and clamp down on public Protestant worship.\nGuise and Lorraine were initially open to a proposal by the duca di Savoia (duke of Savoia) who had announced his plan to invade and conquer Genève. However, by July Lorraine wrote to Savoia announcing that France could no longer support this policy, arguing that the king was too focused on affairs in Scotland. Beyond this concern, an attack on Genève risked a new European war and a full civil war in France. By September, Guise felt differently, and assured Savoia that he would in a personal capacity support an attack against Genève with military force.\n\n\n=== Assembly of Notables ===\n\nIn August the crown decided to convoke an Assembly of Notables at Fontainebleau to resolve the kingdoms ills. In attendance from 21 to 26 August were 54 men, composed of the king's councillors, the princes du sang, the great officers of the crown, the maître des requêtes de l'hôtel (masters of requests) and chevaliers of the ordre de Saint-Michel. The four secrétaires d'État were also present, though their role was largely confined to note taking and the transmission of orders. Catherine, Marie Stuart and François were in attendance. Of the six Lorraine brothers, all but the grand prieur were present. Also attending were: Montmorency, two of his sons and all three of his Châtillon nephews; the ducs de Nevers, Longueville, Montpensier; the prince de La Roche-sur-Yon; marshals Saint-André, Brissac and Thermes; the cardinal de Bourbon, the archbishop of Vienne, the bishops of Orléans and Valence; the seigneurs de Gonnor, Vielleville, Sansac (all three who would go on to become marshals) and Gonzague (future duc de Nevers). The proceedings took place in the chambers of Catherine, which Durot sees as symbolic of the changing balance of political power. To ensure a majority present supported the crowns plans, a new batch of chevaliers were elevated to the ordre shortly before the Assembly was convened.\nNeither Condé or Navarre were present to represent their interests at the Assembly of Notables, despite the urgings of Montmorency for them to join him there. The crown itself had made appeals for their presence through the despatch of the sieur de Carrouges to Guyenne on 3 August. Letters begging for them to come were sent by both Catherine and Guise, the latter saying that Navarre's 'prudent and wise advise' was desperately needed. For the Lorraine brothers, there was confidence that the Bourbons would either ignore the summons, or if they did in fact arrive be too timid to challenge the majority of François. Upon the return of Carrouges and Saint-André to court, the latter explained he was unable to divine the intentions of the Bourbon princes, while the former brought letters from Navarre in which Navarre explained he could not be present in time for the assembly so they should begin without him, he further made recriminations against injustices directed at him. This failure to attend weakened the argument of the Bourbon-Vendôme princes that they were being unjustly excluded from the government. Further, François, Catherine and Montmorency were offended by his failure to listen to their respective summons. Montmorency himself arrived in grand style with his three Châtillon nephews, his cousin the marquis de Villars and 800 horsemen in his escort as a show of his power. He received warm greetings from the king, the queen mother and Guise, who embraced him.\nThe assembly was opened with speeches from Catherine who encouraged those present to ensure that royal authority was maintained and that the problems that afflicted the country were soothed. Catherine hoped that the assembly would show the libels that accused the king of being a puppet of the Lorraine brothers to be false. The new chancellor L'Hôpital then spoke. He characterised the assembly as a combination of the First (clergy) and Second (nobility) Estate, without the presence of the third, whose troubles they would sooth through their discussions. As Catherine had, he urged the assembled delegates to fix the ills of the state. Reports followed from both the duc de Guise and cardinal de Lorraine in which they updated the Assembly on the matters of state as concerned their areas of the government. In his address, Lorraine informed those assembled that the annual budget deficit was now around 2,500,000 livres. With this accomplished, the assembled delegates now had the floor.\nThe Assembly devolved into angry recriminations over the need for reform and religious matters. This was after Coligny, who had returned from the mission Catherine gave him, presented two petitions (one to the king, one to Catherine) from the Protestants of Normandie on 23 August in which they asked for the suspension of persecution and the provision of temples. The petitions went so far as to analogise the treatment of Protestants and Jews, arguing that the latter although \"abominable before god\" had been afforded temples for their worship in several parts of the Christian world for the sake of peace, therefore how much more worthy of temples are those who recognise Christ as lord. Coligny justified the request for temples by highlighting that it was the lack of them that caused disorder, with Protestants moving under armed guard to sites of worship outside where there was more likely to be confrontations with Catholics. François responded generously to Coligny's petitions, praising the admiral for his good conduct. Guise commented that religious toleration of Protestantism would bring about the damnation of the king. He further noted that the petition was unsigned, beginning a dispute between the two men at the assembly. Coligny informed Guise that he could get ten thousand signatures if needs be, to which Guise rejoindered he could get 100,000 for a counterpetition, chief among them his own. He further added that no council would separate him from his faith in the sacrament, though he granted that he would leave matters of doctrine to the prelates. Coligny further complained that it was not possible to approach or petition the king. This complaint was directed at the condition of the king, who was surrounded by a company of arquebusiers under the command of Richelieu 'Le Moine'. It was also taking aim at the cancellation of the royal tour of the kingdom that had been planned at the beginning of the year. Guise rejoindered that such precautions were a necessity due to the recent conspiracy, which although it protested to only target the king's advisers, in fact would target the king as his advisers had not been in error.\nCalls went out at the Assembly from the Protestant sympathetic archbishop of Vienne, bishop of Orléans and bishop of Valence for an Estates General and General council of the church. The bishop of Orléans denounced the corruption of the Catholic church, and stated that it was little wonder so many were attracted to Protestantism with the French church in such a state. The bishop of Valence argued that it was pointless to fight the flames that consumed the French church with 'waters from the Tiber' when one could do so with 'waters from the Seine', by which he meant a national council over a general council. The Cardinal de Tournon grated at the metaphor. The archbishop of Vienne argued that given the Pope was so reticent to hold a general council of the church, it was only proper to hold a national one. It would also be necessary for an Estates General to resolve the ills of the kingdom. The Lorraine government was favourable to these proposals with both Lorraine and Guise endorsing the plans, the former proposing an investigation into ecclesiastical corruption to prepare the way. Lorraine further stated that the state would leave alone those whose only crime was the practice of Protestantism peaceably, while continuing to persecute those who cause seditions and disruptions. It would be the job of the bishops to win back the peaceable Protestants to the Roman church. The next day the chevaliers of the ordre de Saint-Michel voiced their agreement with the positions outlined by Lorraine, and the assembly began to wind down. A majority voted in favour of these proposals on 31 August. It was agreed to host an Estates General, with the plan being for it to meet at Meaux, though this location would be changed to Orléans on 2 October. Chancellor L'Hôpital was pleased to see the Estates General convened, seeing it as a means by which the king could throw down the screen of relying on advisors to tell him what is going on his kingdom by affording him access to the entirety of his people.  The Assembly had also established that governors and judiciary officials were only to seek out Protestants when they were involved in sedition (i.e. meeting under arms).\nAs an interim measure until such time the bodies would convene, an edict was issued prohibiting any subject of the king from raising either troops or money. By this means it was hoped disorders would lessen.\nThe institution of the Estates General had not been called since the time of Louis XI, though lesser Estates had been called in 1506 and 1558 respectively without the full presence of the Third Estate or a process of elections.\nLorraine believed in the possibility of a religious reunification of the kingdom. It was due to this that he supported the convocation of a national council, with the Protestants invited, to bring about religious unity. The Spanish king Felipe was infuriated when word reached him of the plan for a national council. In contrast to his brother, for Guise the necessity of this pseudo-toleration due to the political realities of the kingdom went strongly against his convictions. It was to be a pause for the moment before the kingdom could return to a unified Catholic orthodoxy.\nThe gestures towards at least temporary toleration made at the Assembly of Notables, induced juridical chaos. While Lorraine was saying that Protestants who were peaceful should be left in peace, none of the persecutory edicts of the 1550s had been revoked. Therefore, the courts were left with contradictory instructions. On 23 August, François ordered the lieutenant-general of Poitou to adopt a religious policy of gentle remonstrance. The sénéschal of Poitou Montpézat would complain to the crown about this conflicting policy the following year. Likewise the bishop of Riez protested to Lorraine in November that he needed clarity so he could know how to avoid deviating from royal intentions either by too great a severity or too great a laxity.\nOn 29 November, the Pope announced his intention to recall the council of Trent to resume its sessions in April 1561. This was a great disappointment to both Lorraine and Catherine who were hoping for a new general council of the church. Lorraine was at this time viewed with considerable suspicion by both España and the Papacy, and furthered their distrust with his continual sending of missives to Roma arguing for a new council that could satisfy the Lutherans as opposed to a continuation of Trent. For Felipe, the possibility of a religious council between France, the Emperor and the German Protestant princes was to be avoided at all costs, for the risk it might pose to Spanish control of Nederland.\nLorraine saw to the organisation for a grand double marriage which was celebrated at Saint-Germain-en-Laye in the first week of October. At this double marriage, the duc de Nevers was remarried. At the same time the young prince de Porcien was married to Nevers' daughter Catherine. All the French princes attended the event, described by Carroll as the 'most glittering social occasion of the year' with the exception of Navarre and Condé. Porcien was an open Protestant and Nevers occupied an ambiguous position between Genève and Roma.\n\n\n=== Navarre and Condé ===\n\nRequests were dispatched from the court asking for the presence of Navarre and Condé. It was hoped that the increasingly rebellious actions of the princes could be contained from spreading if they were kept close to the crown.  In June and July the princes met with the elder Maligny brother who had been involved in the conspiracy of Amboise. At this time Navarre hinted to Catherine that there was a risk of civil war if the crown did not support him in his efforts to gain his kingdom back from Felipe II.\nOn 26 August, an agent of Condé's, named Jacques de La Sague was picked up by a Guisard captain while in Étampes. La Sague had recently visited Chantilly, Paris and the court distributing letters. He had documents on his person that implicated both Navarre and Condé in a new plotted uprising. Soldiers were to be raised, salaries paid, relations undertaken with the Protestants of the Empire. Under torture he implicated several others who were close to them. Indirectly implicated were the governor of Provence the comte de Tende, the lieutenant-general of Guyenne, Burie; the future lieutenant-general of Guyenne, Monluc the lieutenant-general of Picardie, Sénarpont; and several great Protestant lords. Monluc's presence among the accused could be considered surprising considering his later reputation, but in 1560 there were rumours of his contacts with Navarre and attendance of Protestant services. In the letters in La Sague's possession Condé called for support in opposing the Lorraine government from Constable Montmorency and the vidame de Chartres, the former having demurred while the latter offered his support for a 'worthy enterprise in the name of the king' and he was therefore promptly locked in the Bastille on 29 August. The prince de Condé further looked for financial aid from Elizabeth of England, but now that her Scottish ambitions had been satisfied, she had less need of the proposal. On 31 August François wrote to the duca di Savoia with specific information about captains who were to be raised under Condé's banner, with Navarre also implicated in the plans.\nWith the failure of the first attempts at summons, the princes brother the Cardinal de Bourbon was sent by Catherine to bring them to court arriving in the south on 2 September. His appeal failed. A request was sent to Felipe II on 31 August so that he might menace Navarre with his troops, a prospect he responded to favourably on 13 September. Thus the rebellious princes would be caught between the royal and Spanish armies. Navarre was suitably chastened by the Spanish moves towards his jure uxoris (by the rights of his wife) lands. Finally the seigneur de Crussol, Catherine's chevalier d'honneur was sent on 31 August with an ultimatum for them to attend the upcoming Estates General. Crussol was chosen both due to his loyalty to the crown and his perceived Protestant leanings which were felt to make him more acceptable to the princes. He arrived to deliver it on 9 September and they agreed to make their way north. Crussol was told to inform Navarre that his rebellious indiscretions had been revealed to the court by the Montmorency. To this was added the information on the arrest of the vidame de Chartres. By this means it was hoped a wedge would be driven between the two parties. Crussol returned to court on 19 September and informed the crown the princes would arrive before September was concluded, Bourbon meanwhile, who arrived back on 28 September estimated the renegade princes would not arrive until 20 October. François was greatly frustrated by news that their arrival would be so delayed, as it contravened his instruction for their arrival.\nCatherine put Felipe II of España and the duca di Savoia (duke of Savoia) on standby in case there was a great showdown between the crown and the princes. Both Felipe and Savoia had a vested interest in opposing Protestant conspiracy in France, the former didn't want his subjects in Nederland to be witness to any international encouragement from France, meanwhile Savoia was keen to see Genève restored to his domains. On 13 September, a favourable response was returned by Felipe to the prospect of menacing Navarre. A week later, on 21 September, an envoy arrived at the French court, and it was agreed that Felipe would amass a force of around 8,000 soldiers on the French border. This envoy also took the opportunity to protest against the prospect of a national council of the French church, but François defended the project, arguing repression had accomplished nothing but destabilising his kingdom. Nevertheless the duque de Alburquerque (duke of Alburquerque) mobilised forces in Spanish controlled Navarre in support of putting pressure on the Bourbon princes.\nThe decision of Navarre and Condé to attend court was made despite the warning of their wives Jeanne d'Albret (Navarre) and Éléonore de Roye (Condé). De Bèze counselled that they do all they could to ensure the upcoming Estates General would hold the Guise government to account. Other advisers assured him that men would rise up across France to ensure he held a strong hand at the Estates. The two rebel princes departed sometime after 17 September. An army of nobles agglomerates around them as they march north. Navarre and Condé hoped that by this means they would overawe the court and establish a settlement favourable to themselves at the Estates General, to this end they encouraged Maligny and Montbrun to unify with them in Limoges. Through late September and early October bands of soldiers from the Midi (around 3–4,000) made their way towards Poitou and Limousin, with around 800 gentleman arriving in the latter. Aware of this, the king entrusted d'Escars and the comte de Ventadour with ensuring unrest was suppressed in Limousin. A further 6,000 footmen from Gascogne were ready to join him in marching north if he gave the order. De Bèze initially travelled with the princes as they marched north, but warned of the danger that lied ahead, he slipped away during the crossing of central France. Fearful that their procession to court might become a military march the cordon of royal troops were slowly introduced around the princes' party as they advanced. Navarre was outraged, upon his arrival at Chaunay in Poitou on 13 October to find Montpézat meet him with orders to deny his entry into the town, he protested to Catherine who assured him she had not ordered Montpézat's actions, but the sénéschal assured Navarre she had personally instructed him to follow this course. Navarre's party was shadowed by Marshal de Thermes, who had been granted command of eight compagnies d'ordonnance, with whom Navarre would enter dispute when he arrived at Poitiers. Navarre insulted by Thermes' demeanour, wrote to Catherine to get him to back off.  Navarre, increasingly aware due to the surrounding royalist compagnies d'ordonnance that the government had retained the loyalty of a greater portion of the military nobility than he had counted on began to reduce the size of his entourage, and allow the firebrands with him to slip away. When the party of princes arrived at Châtellerault, those sympathetic to the princes cause offered to spirit them away to Anjou and the Norman ports, but Navarre begrudgingly determined to continue on to court.\n\n\n=== Lèse majesté ===\nFrançois announced his intentions for the arrival of the princes on 5 October. He would \"make [Navarre] know that I am king and have the power and means to make him obey me\". All the chevaliers of the ordre de Saint-Michel (of whom there were around 40 present) and grandees of court were summoned to François' chambers to renew their oaths of loyalty to him, with Guise proclaiming that his life, those of his children and his property would be in service of the king. The king turned to Catherine and informed her that she too would be part of the war to come. Cardinal de Bourbon in tears plead that his brothers would be good servants of the king, to which François responded that if they were so, he would treat them as he would his parents, if not he would see them punished. At this time, it was declared by the crown that all provincial governors with the exception of Guise and Montmorency were to return to their charges. A full mobilisation of royal troops was undertaken. The arrière ban was declared. François ordered the Catholic nobility to put itself on a war footing in aid of combatting the disorders. The governor of Bretagne, complained to Guise that the frequent declaration of the arrière ban would cause a deterioration in obedience to the summons, in combination with the problem of Protestant nobles. Four compagnies d'ordonnance were raised in the Touraine under the duc de Montpensier, five in the Orléanais under the prince de La Roche-sur-Yon, five in Champagne under the the duc de Nevers, two in the Île de France under Marshal de Montmorency, six in the Lyonnais under Marshal de Saint-André, six in Picardie beneath Marshal de Brissac, a further six distributed across lower Normandie and Rouen. The commanders La Brosse and Sébastien de Luxembourg were instructed to bring their seasoned troops back from Scotland. Troops were stripped from the border fortresses, such as Saint-Quentin in Picardie, so that they might be turned to face the prospect of internal war. On 7 October, Montmorency departed court, unsatisfied with his treatment by the king. He had hoped to plead for clemency for the vidame de Chartres with Guise, only to be rebuked by the king that he desired to know too much. In combat of the conspiratorial efforts consuming the south of France, royal troops brutally pacified the Rhône valley. Protestant assemblies were dispersed, but they were treated as seditious rather than heretical, and there was no replication of the religious persecution of 1559. Protestants were not put to death for their faith. With this accomplished new unrests broke out in the south-west of the kingdom. The court also continued its efforts at church reform, with bishops being compelled to reside in their benefices. Progress was slow on this front, with Villars bemoaning a majority of Languedoc's bishops remained absentees.\nShortly before the court arrived in Orléans, the seigneur de Sipierre was despatched to enter first, and ensure that the city was secure. François arrived in Orléans for the upcoming Estates on 18 October, and set himself up in the hôtel. Orléans had been central during the conspiracy of Amboise and was very proximate to the duché de Vendôme, the Bourbon stronghold. Its central positioning in the kingdom made it ideal for a revolt that could cut the kingdom into two. Suspecting the Bourbon's plotted to do just that, François therefore pre-empted them by establishing both himself and the Estates in the city. Four companies of soldiers were brought into the city. The king declared that he would defend with force both his crown and life as necessary. On 29 October the court learned that Navarre and Condé were in Blois and would be imminently arriving, La Roche-sur-Yon, his son and the son of the duc de Montpensier set out to meet with their cousins.\nNavarre and Condé arrived at court in Orléans on 30 October. They were greeted like rebels by the Lorraine government. There was no reception that would typically be granted to men of their rank. The city had been surrounded with troops for their arrival, and was under conditions not dissimilar from martial law. Many nobles had been summoned to the court for the sensitive manoeuvre that was to follow, with further inductions into the ordre de Saint-Michel (an unprecedented 18 promotions on 29 September), all of them clients of Guise, Montmorency and Catherine. Among those inducted were the sieur de Genlis - former master of Guise's household, the seigneur de La Motte-Gondrin - lieutenant general in Dauphiné; the seigneur de Beauvais-Nangis - commander of the town of Guise; the vicomte de Martigues and the comte de Crussol, Catherine's chevalier d'honneur. While many of these men were not clients of Guise or Lorraine at the time of their promotion, they largely had services that were useful to the administration. At this time Crussol was also inducted into the conseil privé. Entering the king's presence, Navarre and Condé had to navigate through the crowds of courtiers while being heaped with mocking jeers. Navarre spoke to the king first, saying the two men had come in obedience to the king and that Condé was keen to clear his name. François reservedly praised Navarre for his obedience and informed him he was not to leave court until the nature of his conduct had been cleared up. When Condé tried to imitate his brother, the king informed him that he had selected appropriate persons to judge his actions. François retired to his private quarters and then summoned the brothers to him, in this more private surround (where only Catherine, the king and Cardinal de Bourbon were present) Condé was accused of involvement in the conspiracy of Amboise, and uprisings in Bordeaux and Lyon. Condé angrily denounced the Lorraine government, while Navarre protested and the Cardinal de Bourbon cried. François silenced the protests, declaring to Navarre that the matter had been decided long ago. Condé was led away by two guards, and put under arrest. The Lorraine brothers ensured their distance from the arrest, only the marshals, Montpensier, and La Roche-sur-Yon signed the arrest warrant. The cardinal de Lorraine was reportedly left saddened by the arrest. The prince de Condé made appeals to the sieur de Genlis, knowing his closeness with Guise, hoping that he might intercede in his favour. Condé was moved to a house with barred windows which was guarded by cannons. The commander of his imprisonment was a certain 'captain Gohaz' who had served in Scotland under Martigues. His arrest was an international frustration for Protestants, with his German co-religionists grieving the matter. After several weeks under house arrest, he was put on trial on 13 November. Condé's mother in law, the comtesse de Roye was also arrested at Anizy-le-Château by the sieur de Carrouges on the charge of having concealed Maligny. Romier argues this \"blunder\" to arrest the half-sister of the Châtillon brothers and niece of Montmorency was the king's error. The baron de Jarnac was tasked with seeing to the arrest of Navarre's chancellor, Amaury Bouchart. It was viewed as necessary to ensure the conviction of Condé was a settled matter before the Estates could arrive and potentially upset the arrangement.\nThe product of the interrogations of Jacques de La Sague and Gilles Triou were presented to the judges. Saint-André brought prisoners to the city so that they might confront Condé. The prince did not initially recognise the cognisance of commissioners who were assigned to interrogate him, nor the authority of the council to judge him. Questioned by de Thou he refused to answer. He insisted that only a trial by all the peers of the realm (or the entirety of the Parlement alongside peers of the realm could be appropriate for a man of his status. He further suggested openly for the first time that the king was in fact a minor, and therefore the acts of the conseil privé were invalid. His interrogators accused him of lèse majesté to which he retorted with more denunciations directed against Guise.  Despite the concerted efforts of Bourbon and Navarre to save their brother, and Éléonore (who had been released by Catherine) to save her husband, Condé was sentenced, possibly to death by the judges on 26 November (though two of his judges would not sign the sentence - L'Hôpital and du Mortier), with Guise and Lorraine keen to see this accomplished quickly as the king's health began to fail in November. Indeed, François had first passed out during vespers on 17 November. Lorraine responded to the failing health of the king by ordering processions and prayers be undertaken for his health, Guise meanwhile threatened to hang the king's doctors.\nRomier contends that the notion of Condé being condemned to death is an invention of later Bourbon aligned historians. Thompson concurs with him that the most severe punishment Condé could expect was imprisonment in Loches for the rest of his life - as was the opinion of the Venetian ambassador. Durot simply argues that a sentence of death was not reached by the judges. Carpi by contrast argues that he was due to be executed on 10 December. Regardless, the reticence of all the judges to sign bought time for Condé. Catherine encouraged the reticent judges. There was also fears that a new Amboise conspiracy was being prepared to spring Condé from his captivity, timed to coincide with the meeting of the Estates General.\nDuring the days of Condé's captivity, Navarre participated in the conseil des affaires, went hunting with the king, and while maintaining a belief in his brothers innocence allowed himself to build relations with the cardinal de Lorraine and Catherine. According to the Spanish ambassador, he was approached by the leader of a prospective rebellion in Grenoble, who boasted that he had 1,800 men near the city ready to fight for the gospel. However, according to the ambassador, Navarre keen to prove his loyalty quickly denounced the man to the court. In council on 20 November, he protested that two of his brothers had died in service of François I, proclaiming that the comte d'Enghien had given the king his most glorious day with the victory of Ceresole. Now the king's grandson desired Condé's blood. Catherine assured him that François II would subscribe to the judgement chosen by the princes judges, and Navarre calmed down, apologising for his outburst.\n\n\n=== Death of the king ===\nFrançois II died on 5 December from a tumour that had developed behind his ear, having received extreme unction from the cardinal de Lorraine that day. In his chambers the following morning, Brissac, Longueville, Nemours, Étampes and Guise conducted mass, before departing to the residence of the new king. With François' brother, the nine year old Charles were Catherine, Marie Stuart and Navarre who swore their loyalty to the new king. First Guise and then Lorraine declared that they regretted the errors of the past but would only work towards the service of the king. Catherine reassured them that their actions had always been at the instruction of François. With the situation in the kingdom altered by François' death, Condé was quickly released from his imprisonment, being restored to freedom on 24 December. To preserve the dignity of the Lorraine brothers, it was declared that his imprisonment had been the sole will of the late king. Condé travelled first to La Fère, then to court where he was admitted on 15 March. He was declared rehabilitated by the Parlement of Paris on 13 June. In August he was officially reconciled with the duc de Guise in an official ceremony, though it could little disguise the hatred between the two men.\nThe vidame de Chartres by contrast was not released from his imprisonment. He died while still under guard at the hôtel des Tournelles on 22 December.\nFrançois did not receive a formal royal burial. Instead on 8 December his remains were transported by the prince de La Roche-sur-Yon under a gold canopy to the Sainte-Croix Cathedral in Orléans where his heart was enclosed in a lead casket. Protestants considered the king a tyrant for his treatment of Condé while Catholics believed him to have been weak. Within a month of the death of the king, La Roche-sur-Yon's own son the marquis de Beaupréau was also dead. This prompted the Spanish ambassador to remark that the first and last of the royal house were both taken in succession.\nMuch as they had celebrated the divine intervention of the death of Henri, some Protestants celebrated the miraculous death of François which had 'saved the life of Condé'. Poems were written in which his death was described as a divine punishment. Among those celebrating was the English ambassador, who looked forward to the prospect of the Châtillon-Montmorency faction regaining ascendency at court. From Genève, Calvin wrote with exuberance on the timeliness of François' death, which was 'clearly a gift from god'. The Spanish ambassador meanwhile opined that it seemed like the court was going to be dominated by various noble families each seeking to advance the interests of their house, reducing the realm to chaos.\n\n\n== Regency ==\n\n\n=== New government ===\n\nThe death of François II spelled the end of the Lorraine government, with Catherine's second son the duc d'Orléans ascendency the throne as Charles IX. Despite being a minor, in the estimation of the chancellor l'Hôpital, the young king already possessed the sole vision necessary to bring about order in the kingdom and banish fear. As Charles was only 10 years old, a regency was declared. Catherine assumed the role of regent. Lorraine was removed from his role as the leader of the kings financial affairs, to be replaced by chancellor l'Hôpital. As such on 12 December he announced his desire to retire to Reims. Guise at least temporarily remained the ascendant figure in military affairs. To assume the regency Catherine had to negotiate with the king of Navarre, who as premier prince du sang had a claim to the regency himself. On 2 December, before the death of the king, Navarre was brought before Catherine who reproached him with involvement in the various Bourbon plots. Catherine presented considerable evidence of his involvement in the conspiracies. Seeing his doom, Navarre protested his innocence and promised to relinquish any rights he had to the regency. Catherine had this drawn up in writing, promising that in return he would receive the role of lieutenant-general of the kingdom. Catherine agreed to support him in his efforts to receive compensation for Navarre, which had largely been annexed by the Spanish, and a future marriage between her daughter Marguerite and his son the young Henri. He therefore agreed to support Catherine's claim to the responsibilities of the regency. An embrace between him and his great enemies the Lorraine princes was then staged in which the two exchanged the kiss of peace. Over the following days Navarre would spend much time with Guise who explained to a confident that Navarre had asked for his forgiveness. On 17 December, Guise and Lorraine departed from court to make a Marian pilgrimage to Basilique Notre-Dame de Cléry accompanied by around 500 nobles in a show of strength. The pilgrimage was armed, like a crusade. According to Brantôme, Guise was being urged at this time by councillors and one of his brothers to undertake a coup.\nWith Guise absent, Catherine began to make moves of consolidation: companies of footmen believed to be devoted to Guise were dismissed, command of the army was restored to Montmorency, with d'Andelot allowed to resume his charge as colonel-general and the court chaplain Charles d'Humières was replaced with the humanist Jacques Aymot. Nevertheless, seeing the power of his departure, Catherine recalled him to court upon which Guise offered the young king his life for the defence of his crown and kingdom. The king responded that he considered Guise one of his most faithful servants.  Catherine was appointed officially to the role by the royal council on 21 December. With a formal regency in effect, royal power was less absolute, and more open to the possibilities of challenge from great lords, not to mention the religious crisis that was consuming the kingdom. Catherine resolved that the path to political survival was to balance the competing factions that surrounded the court.\nIt was declared on 6 December that the conseil secret would be composed of the cardinals de Lorraine and Tournon, the duc de Guise and Montmorency, the king of Navarre, the chancellor de l'Hôpital and the marshals de Brissac and Saint-André. The conseil privé meanwhile would remain as it had during François' reign.\nIn the conseil privé on 8 December, Guise lost his patience with Coligny concerning Protestant assemblies. He announced that were it not for the dignity of their surrounds he would have stabbed Coligny.\nGuise, excised from formal power, still carried a great deal of power through his clientele network. When he travelled he took with him 800 nobles. At this time one of them, the bastard of Bueil was assassinated by a relative of Montmorency's the comte de Laval.\nThe downfall of Guise and Lorraine was counterbalanced by the return of Montmorency to court, with the elderly grandee finding himself recalled shortly after the departure of the Lorraine princes from power. Montmorency approached court with a large armed force of his own, arriving on the evening of 7 December. Coligny was keen to exploit the new political balance by going after the Guise for their 'plots against him', and to this end presented 'incriminating evidence' against them. However Catherine urged him to be kind to them much to his annoyance. Coligny was emboldened by the assurance he had received from the English queen that he could 'boldly make record of her constancy'.\nThe bishop of Dax took credit for leading the negotiations between Catherine and Navarre that reached the arrangement that secured Catherine the regency. He was later accused of being a Protestant by the inquisition in 1563 because of his support of religious toleration and closeness with the Coligny brothers.\nLouis de Gonzague, future duc de Nevers, at this time gave his estimation of the power balance in the court in which he resided. According to him Catherine enjoyed the greatest pre-eminence, while Navarre was second in authority limited by his poor mind, Tournon would have had the third greatest but for his age. Guise waited for summons while Lorraine claimed to wish to depart court. Marshal de Saint-André enjoyed great influence, while the other Marshal, Brissac was more secondary. Montmorency was also secondary in Gonzague's opinion.\nThe royal council beneath Catherine was broad and contained a range of religious opinions. In the analysis of the contemporary jurist François Baudouin there were three factions in the court. For the uncompromising Catholics the cardinals de Bourbon, Guise and Tournon, the ducs d'Aumale, d'Étampes and Guise; and marshals de Saint-André and Brissac. Cardinal Lorraine still hoped for some form of negotiated religious settlement. Durot is careful to differentiate Lorraine from others who hoped for a peaceful reconciliation of the French church, arguing his outlook was different to that of the bishop of Valence or Catherine. For him it was the confession of Augsburg that offered a way forward. Acceptance of the sacrament was the distinguisher for Lorraine between schismatics such as the Lutherans and heretics. The confession of Augsburg had the further advantages of emphasising French independence and forging ties with the princes of the Holy Roman Empire. The chancellor L'Hôpital, prince de La Roche-sur-Yon, king of Navarre, cardinal de Châtillon and bishops of Valence and Orléans likewise hoped for a peaceful reunification of the French church. Baudouin also places the councillors Paul de Foix, Claude d'Espence and Jean de Salignac in this party. Coligny represented the definitively Protestant wing of the council.\nWith Catherine in power, the secrétaires d'État now reported directly to the centre of royal authority, without any intermediary influence. Catherine looked to them for support. Going forward as a rule, dispatches from their various areas of responsibility would be presented to Catherine, who then opened them. This streamlined the process of administration from the confusing situation which had existed in prior times. It also allowed dispatches to be concealed from viewership by Navarre.\n\n\n=== Kingdom of Navarre ===\nDuring the period of Spanish mobilisation on the borders of France, the queen of Navarre had seen to the fortification of Béarn.\nFrom her estates in Pau, the queen of Navarre formerly declared her abjuration from Catholicism and adoption of Protestantism on 25 December. Some historians attribute her conversion to de Bèze's efforts. Soon after taking this step she received delighted correspondence from the queen of England. Calvin for his part wrote his first letter to the queen in January 1561.\n\n\n=== Estates General of Orléans ===\n\nBy the time of the Estates General of 1560, which was to be held at Orléans, the Protestant communities of places such as Poitiers were growing in confidence. As elections were being undertaken in October and November, they inserted a demand for full religious toleration into the cahiers (grievances drawn up by the local Estates) for the Third Estate delegates to take to the body at large. This was despite urgings by Lorraine and Guise for the religious question to be prohibited from the election process, for fear of exciting the passions that had caused the Amboise conspiracy. Protestants also asserted themselves in Blois, Angers, Angoulême, Rodez, Millau, Rouen, Cahors and Montauban, demanding the rights of public worship and temples. Even in areas where Protestants were a small minority, they were able to attract sympathy for their remonstrances due the widescale nature of abuses. While heresy was denounced by the cahiers of Épernay, the same cahiers explained the national presence of the 'new opinion' as a response to the abuses of the church who denounced any criticism of their practices as heresy. In Angers the lawyer François Grimaudet made vociferous attacks on the corruption of the church and judiciary. The assembly in the city was packed with armed men who wore kerchiefs to identify each other, they ensured a rapturous reception for toleration of Protestantism and the seizure of church wealth and stopped any motions against these propositions from being tabled. Scandalised Catholics departed from the assemblies. In Blois, the common people made an attempt to break down the door to the hôtel de ville where the urban notables were meeting for the election, thus they were allowed in to the process. Catholics were not entirely adverse to anti-clericalism. In Toulouse while the cahier called for the extirpation of heresy, it was also requested that the tithes be reduced and the greed and ignorance of the clergy was lambasted. Amiens urged the king to take the revenue of vacant benefices. Mariéjol highlights that the Estates General of 1560 was the first one in which we can be confident of the participation of the peasantry in the Third Estate election, and that this was reflected in the election of officers of the crown with whom they had to deal, representatives of justice and finance.\nIn total 455 deputies were present for the moment. The First Estate (clergy) would send 127 deputies, the Second Estate (nobility) would send 107 while the Third Estate (commons) would send 221 deputies. The disparity in numbers had no consequence on the Estates as the votes were undertaken by order, not by head.\nOn 13 December, shortly after the death of François, the Estates General was opened in Orléans. The delegates were initially unsure whether their mandate to meet remained valid given the death of the king. The notion of returning to the provinces for new elections was floated, however this was unacceptable to Catherine who feared it would return a slate of delegates eager to put the regency in Navarre's hands. She therefore had it declared in the conseil privé that their powers remained valid despite the death of the king.\nIn L'Hôpital's opening address he urged the deputies to put aside religious epithets such as 'papist' and 'Lutheran' and unite as Christians. They were to compete with one another only in matters of charity, prayers and persuasion. Those who in the name of religion conducted disorders or seditions would be subject to the king's justice and punishment. Seditious violence was for L'Hôpital like atheism, and it was key for magistrates to suppress such troubles. He highlighted the financial plight of the crown, announcing to the Estates, that all royal pensions were between two and five years in arrears. L'Hôpital saw the contraction of royal favour as a cause of the troubles with the aggrieved denied rewards they feel they rightly deserve resulting to seditions. Those favoured under Henri who no longer enjoyed the same royal benefits had to remember the crown was not given to the king by his subjects. Such a situation, L'Hôpital argued, was improper, the king was omnipotent and could dispense his favour as he pleased. The chancellor argued that the clergy must remember their sole power was over souls, and that they should not try to give law to princes.\nCatherine directed the Estates towards a policy of religious moderation. Both the Second and Third Estates were open to the idea of religious toleration, and had many Protestants among their numbers. Some of the cahiers of the Second Estate were thinly disguised in their Protestantism, urging a return to the bible for resolving doctrinal disputes. Beyond this they support a thorough reform of the practices of the church. The Protestants among the Second Estate tried to direct the discussions towards the matter of Navarre's right to the regency, however the majority of the discussions were devoted to finance. The Second Estate found itself too divided even to establish a united cahier.\nHaving been meeting separately the three estates gathered for their first full body session on 1 January. By having the Estates meet separately until this point, the crown ensured they could not engage in united action, however it had the counter-effect of making it harder for the crown to set the agenda of their discussions. The speaker of the First Estate a canon-lawyer from Paris named Quintin declared that the king's sole duty was to strike down 'heretics', and that no relations should be conducted with Protestant polities like Genève. He deplored the Second and Third Estate, both of whom advised the king finance himself at the expense of the clergy. This aroused the indignation of the speakers of the Second (the baron de Rochefort) and Third Estates (Jean Lange, a lawyer of Bordeaux) who denounced the ignorant greed of the First. Rochefort further argued that the nobility had a right, by their position as gentleman to freedom of worship. The histoire ecclésiastique noted with approval that Rochefort never addressed the king as his majesty ('a recent invention of flatterers'). Coligny complained to the queen about Quintin's address and he was forced to apologise, protesting that they were not his own thoughts, but those he had been asked to read. Factions of the Second Estate from Dauphiné and Bourgogne (which were governed by Guise and Aumale respectively) pushed for the Lorraine princes to be made equal to the princes du sang in rank. However this was rejected by the Estates at large due to the broader Second Estate having distate for the proposal.\nCatherine was frustrated at this arguing and tried to move the Estates to financial matters. Matters of finance had not been mentioned in the summons for the Estates. On 13 January L'Hôpital tried to direct the Estates towards a large financial package that would have relieved the crown of its debts. He informed the estates that the royal debt amounted to over 40,000,000 livres. For L'Hôpital it was clear that the debts were the fault of prior monarchs warlike nature. However the deputies were unmoved by this revelation, the First and Second Estate both refused to endorse donations, while the Third Estate decided, after ten days of debate that they did not have the mandate to support the requested subsidies from their elections. The Estates declared their interest in investigating the financial dealings of the favourites of the reign of Henri II (Saint-André, Guise, Montmorency, Diane) for financial impropriety. The First Estate proposed that royal pensions be further curtailed. They proposed improper gifts and pensions be returned to the crown. The Estates would meet until January, when the session was brought to an end. L'Hôpital proposed that the First Estate redeem loans and other expenditures worth around 15,000,000 livres, the Second Estate pay the gabelle and the Third Estate accept an increase in the taille and a wine tax. The deputies were returned to their provinces so that they might consider the chancellors financial requests of them. Knecht characterises the closure of the first meeting of the Estates as a 'prorogueing'.\nThe Estates therefore would resume at Pontoise in August. They were initially intended to reconvene at an earlier date in May but were pushed back by Catherine, who hoped more time would sooth the anger of the deputies. Catherine's assumption of the regency was not put before the Estates for their approval or disapproval during January, instead in council on 21 December the power sharing agreement between Catherine and Navarre was approved. Catherine would enjoy the powers of regent without technically holding the title, instead holding the title of 'governor of France'. She would chair royal council, and would direct both domestic and international policy. Letters patent were read to her before even they were read to her son. She had a royal seal fashioned for herself which acclaimed that she was 'Catherine, by the grace of God, queen of France, mother of the king'. In the image on the seal she occupied the place traditionally assumed by the king. She was to maintain the seal except for periods of illness or incapacity, in which circumstances Navarre was to enjoy the right. She also ensured that she was the only one other than the king who could sleep in his chambers and expressed her desire to never be separated from the king. The Estates were informed that there was no such thing as an interregnum, and that royal authority transferred instantaneously from one holder of the office to the next. The Estates protested their right to choose those who advise the king during his minority. They were eventually convinced to support Catherine's rights. Catherine wrote to her daughter, the queen of España on 19 December on the matter of Navarre, telling Élisabeth that Navarre was very obedient, and only acted with her approval.\nWith the Estates dispersed to get a new mandate from their baillages, a package of reforms was issued based on the discussions that had been undertaken during December. Firstly, the king issued lettres de cachet on 28 January in which the release of religious prisoners called for by the first edict of Amboise and edict of Loches was restated. It was emphasised that this amnesty also included those who had been under arms during the conspiracy of Amboise, but not the leaders. The broader Ordonnance d'Orléans, promulgated on 31 January promised the suppression of venal (purchased) office, as requested by the Second Estate, reform to the process by which bishops were elected and regulation that they are to reside in their benefices instead of occupying the charges as absentees. Of the 150 articles in the Ordonnance, 29 were concerned with rectifying the abuses of the church. In a rejection of the Concordat of 1516, elections were restored for bishops with three names to be suggested by the electors to the king who would choose the bishop (with Papal approval). Widescale reform of the judiciary and ecclesiastical professions was included in the Ordonnance. All new financial and judicial offices created since the time of Louis XII would be allowed to go extinct on the death of their present holders. This therefore implied that evil practice had entered the kingdom during the reign of François I. Registration of the Ordonnance was to be obstructed in the parlement and L'Hôpital had to force it through the body in April. L'Hôpital hoped the Ordonnance would be only the opening act of the reform of the French state. The Ordonnance would not be enforced. The crown lacked the financial position to buy back the venal office it had already issued. New venal offices would be created to meet financial need, bishops continued to fail to reside in their benefices. During 1561, the protests against royal pensions would also be answered, as they were all reduced by a third, while the income of the gentilhomme de la chambre du roi (gentleman of the king's chamber) were cut in half.\nAt this time Catherine wrote to Genève, imploring the city to call back its preachers from France who 'disturbed the peace' of the kingdom.\nThe crown also negotiated with the Papacy for financial relief, the Pope agreed that if the French did not convene a national council of their church, and brought a fleet to bare against the Osmanlı İmparatorluğu, that he would permit a five-year alienation of 360,000 ducats (gold coins) per annum of church revenue.\nThe same day that the Estates General was brought to a close, Navarre, Coligny, cardinal de Châtillon, La Roche-sur-Yon and the bishop of Orléans put their backing behind a petition in council in favour of temples for Protestant worship. Catherine did not yield to the petition and worked to continue her more middle ground policy. To this end she promulgated letters patent on 22 February ordering a cease to any religious persecutions.\nAt the provincial estates of Languedoc, which convened ahead of Pontoise on 20 March in Montpellier, radically anti-clerical views were expounded. For example, a capitoul of Toulouse proposed that the churches temporal assets be liquidated to clear the royal debts, and that any remaining funds could be given to urban commissions to administer. To the distress of the clergy his proposal was adopted and he was selected as a deputy for the overall Estates at Pontoise. For Nîmes, a radical Protestant represented the city in Montpellier. He proposed the granting of churches to the Protestants and denounced the poor morals of the Catholic clergy. His proposals were greeted more coolly, and were not included in the cahiers as they were outside of the financial question they had been asked to consider. It was agreed that instead of being inserted into the cahiers the comte de Crussol would represent his grievances at the Estates General. Crussol, along with the rest of the nobility at the Languedoc Estates had approved of the idea of the Toulousian capitoul, and a modified version of it would be put forward at Pontoise by the Third and Second. Crussol reported to the crown from Montpellier that the estates had adopted the financial measures proposed by the king to resolve the crowns debts. According to Crussol the estates praised the regency government of Catherine and urged her to deploy the princes du sang in her administration.\nIn the provincial estates of Touraine, held in June, a Protestant former mayor of Tours dominated the proceedings with his demand that a place of worship be granted to the Protestants.\n\n\n=== Navarre against Guise ===\nIn January Guise quarrelled with Navarre over the appointment of the guards, which Guise believed to be a responsibility of his as grand maître. He attacked Catherine's lenient policy towards Protestant preachers at the court and took to his bed for several days due to his 'grief' (according to the Ferrarese ambassador). On 31 January Guise announced the kingdom was heading towards ruin.\nDuring February, Navarre took a new position in the legal dispute between the duc de Nemours and Françoise de Rohan (a cousin of the queen of Navarre). While he had previously supported the latter, he now threw in his lot with Nemours. At this time he also took meetings with the English ambassador.\nNow in a fair degree of power, Navarre tried to move against his enemy the duc de Guise in February. He took umbrage with the continued possession of the keys to the courts residence by Guise in his capacity as grand maître. Catherine offered that she would secure the keys to the château for Navarre. Indeed, Guise offered her the keys and assured her his only desire was peace. Navarre however issued an ultimatum that if Guise was not expelled from the court, that he, Montmorency and the Coligny brothers would all depart. Such a large departure of grandees would have been a prelude to a state of civil war. This threat was undermined when Catherine was able to secure a promise from Montmorency (through the pleading of the young king to him) to remain at court with the king in such an eventuality, and with the power of his threat lost, Navarre backed down. He was afraid that making such a move without the support of Montmorency might entail his isolation. The disgrace of Guise was unpalatable to Catherine as it would represent a civil war. Catherine placated Navarre with the promise that his brother Condé (who since being freed from captivity was existing in a state of disgraced exile) could return to court. The royal council declared Condé innocent of the charges against him on 13 March. Condé was not in a conciliatory mood, and agitated for Guise to be held accountable. The prince, frustrated, departed court in the next few days, and was joined in his departure by d'Andelot. The sensitive matter of his legal innocence remained, Catherine did not wish the parlement to pronounce on the matter, preferring they dismiss the case, as a guilty verdict would disgrace the Bourbon family and an innocent verdict would inflame the conflict between Guise and Condé. Guise for his part proposed all the evidence be burned and the prosecution be dropped, despite the fact evidence had already been presented which proved Condé's involvement in the disorders of Lyon. Condé was insulted by Guise's proposal. When the parlement did pronounce in 13 June it was a cautious statement which didn't satisfy any party, nevertheless Condé was exonerated.\nNavarre continued to agitate, and supported the moves by the Parisian electors for the upcoming second Estates General to have himself declared regent. The assembly further made demands that all members of the council during the reign of François II be excluded from authority and royal gifts during the reign of Henri II be returned. Catherine took Navarre to task on this, inquiring of him whether he was the instigator. Navarre replied that he was happy with what he saw, as the position of regent rightfully belonged to him. Catherine rejoindered that she recognised his services, but she would not allow herself to be robbed. With the assistance of the duchesse de Montpensier a compromise was reached. On 27 March Navarre was established in the position of lieutenant-general of the kingdom, and further as head of the royal army. He made an official signing away of his rights to the government of the kingdom, and this was countersigned by Condé for his own rights as a prince du sang. The position of lieutenant-general had only recently been the possession of the duc de Guise, thus depriving him of his military authority. To compensate Montmorency for placing Navarre in supreme control of the army, he was granted a gift of approximately 250,000 livres. Catherine assured the Spanish ambassador that Navarre's role as lieutenant-general was fundamentally subordinate to her own.\nNavarre further involved himself in quarrel with the Marshal Saint-André, the result of which was Saint-André taking leave of court.\nAfter the establishment of Navarre in the role of lieutenant-general of the kingdom, elements of the Lorraine family made a show of their displeasure at the new arrangement by departing court. Lorraine retired to his one of his châteaux on 1 February, writing to the French ambassador to España of his relief to be away from the intrigues of court for a little while. He would return to court shortly after Lent. Along with him went all his other brothers: the duc d'Aumale, the marquis d'Elbeuf, the cardinal de Guise and the Grand Prieur. Nobles with connection to the family, such as the duc de Nemours and Longueville also made their departure during January. From Reims, Lorraine was united with Marie Stuart and he intended to demonstrate that they could assume the role of a counter-power to the court.\nThus Lorraine retired to his archbishopric of Reims. Guise for his part was accompanied by 500 gentleman when he travelled, due to fear that he might be subject to an attack by those loyal to Navarre. Along with many of the Lorraine princes, departed also from court many of the compagnies d'ordonnance that had been summoned to Orléans for the arrest of Condé, a fact which dismayed the crown and court.\n\n\n=== Edict of 19 April to the Edict of July ===\n\nThe crown adopted a religious policy increasingly favourable to the Protestants during the early reign of Charles IX. It was ordered of the parlements that religious prisoners be released by lettres de cachet issued on 28 January and 22 February. This remained on the condition that those who were released would promise to live henceforth as good Catholics without recourse to scandal. Unlike the previous edicts, this included those who had assumed arms, and preachers. Only the chief leaders of the conspiracy of Amboise were excluded from the lettres de cachet drawn up by Catherine. During April, two parlementaires (De Thou and Gilles Bourdin) were deputed by parlement to entreat the king to restore order in the kingdom. On 19 April an edict was established that outlawed the use of religious epithets such as 'papist' and 'huguenot' in fear that such insults were an instigation to violence. Despite this house searches were still permitted and secret Protestant assemblies remained forbidden. Those whose property had been seized and had fled into exile, would be permitted to reclaim their property if they returned as good Catholics. This overturned a clause of the Edict of Châteaubriant. The edict was sent to the governors of the provinces before it was sent to the parlement for registration, due to concerns that the court would be hesitant to register the edict. The parlement of Paris reacted vociferously to this edict, remonstrating the king on 11 May that never before had a French king approved of religious schism in his realm. Moreover, when such 'heresies' had arisen, as with the Albigensians the French kings had seen to its total extermination. It was not the fault of those who gathered outside the houses of illicit preachings, but rather the fault of the illicit preaching itself that disorders resulted, or so the parlement reckoned. The parlement further objected to the subversion of their prerogatives to send out this law before it had received registration from the parlement, an act which 'made the law void'.\nOn 11 June the Protestant seigneur d'Esternay presented a petition to the crown with many Protestant grievances, among them a request for the right to have temples, bring back those who were exiled for their Protestantism and the allowance for public services. The subsequent Edict of July, issued on 30 July, was a fairly mixed edict for the Protestants, despite the overall push towards persecution from the deputies assembled to debate its terms from 23 June to 11 July. Jouanna sees Lorraine as the instigator of the 'pourparlers' at which the terms of the edict were discussed. During the assembly, Coligny and the duc de Guise again clashed as they had in the Assembly of Notables. According to Romier the edict was a \"marvel of calculated incoherence and, it must be said, deception\". In the edict L'Hôpital urged that magistrates contain their desire towards zeal. House searches to look for private worship was prohibited. A new amnesty was declared for religious offences of the past years, on the understanding the offender would now live a law abiding Catholic life. Protestant worship itself remained outlawed. The carrying of firearms was now judged worthy of a death sentence. The harshest punishment that a heretic could face now though was established to be banishment, referrals of sentencing to the parlement could no longer impose the death penalty. False accusations of heresy were to receive the same punishment. The sessions which drew up the edict contained opportunities for voting, the decision to ban all assemblies was achieved with a majority of only three, a matter which according to Étienne Pasquier caused protests from those who opposed the resolution that it was not right to throw France into disorders for three votes. This edict was registered provisionally by the parlement, however the body continued to stall in the registration of the Ordonnance d'Orléans. Despite the prohibitions on Protestantism the edict contained, it was not the herald of a new era of repression. The edict pleased neither the Protestants or the militant Catholics.\nGuise was however more pleased in the edict than he had been in the Edict of 19 April, seeing the explicit ban on assemblies either under arms or without arms as a victory. He did however interpret the edict in a way different to Catherine. The king therefore asked the parlement of Grenoble to ratify the edict so that the troubles of the province might be appeased - the spirit of the law; Guise meanwhile wrote to his lieutenant-general in Dauphiné La Motte-Gondrin urging him to follow the edict by ensuring all assemblies other than Catholic ones were prohibited.\nChancellor L'Hôpital remonstrated in front of the parlement of Paris on 18 June. He argued that to follow the path of François I and Henri II as regards religious policy was to fall into error. For they sought to ameliorate religious divisions by human means, failing to appreciate the division was a divinely sent punishment for men's sins.\n\n\n==== Enforcement ====\nConcerned with the situation in Languedoc, Catherine entrusted two local grandees to see to the enforcement of the Edict of July. The bishop Lorenzo Strozzi was sent to Albi, while the baron de Terride was entrusted with seeing that the situation remained calm in Toulouse and the edict was enforced. He found being afforded access to Toulouse challenging despite his commission. The missions were a failure.\n\n\n=== Triumvirate ===\n\nMatters reached a head between the increasingly liberal atmosphere of royal policy and the intransigent Catholics of the French court on Palm Sunday 1561. On this day, the Protestant Admiral Coligny held a public service in his quarters of the royal château de Fontainebleau. The doors were thrown open and a thousand were present for the display. Coligny's brother the cardinal de Châtillon caused further scandal by celebrating the eucharist 'in the mode of Genève'. With the liberal bishop of Valence due to give the Lenten sermon at court, the Constable retired in disgust after hearing some of his remarks into the servants quarters where he was joined by Saint-André and Guise to hear the sermon of a Jacobin friar. On his way down to the servants quarters, Guise met with Catherine in the gardens and informed her that she could no longer 'drink from two fountains'. Guise, Montmorency and Saint-André received communion together. Guise was increasingly of the opinion that Catherine and Navarre lacked legitimacy before god to govern. To Guise, the attacks on Catholicism the new policy represented were an attack on his very identity.\nIn reaction to the new direction of the crown's religious policy, Montmorency, Saint-André and Guise entered into an informal agreement that has become known to history as the 'Triumvirate'. Carroll notes that the term implies a conspiracy against the state, but argues that there is no evidence such a plan existed. Guise had approach Montmorency to formulate this reconciliation through the conduit of Saint-André. This was established under the auspices of Cardinal de Tournon. The three 'Triumvirs' shared Montmorency's table on 6 April. They agreed to work together to protect the ascendency of Catholicism. According to the Spanish ambassador they announced that they would remain loyal to the king as long as he abided by the tenets of Catholicism, a conditional obedience. They also agreed to work together to confound the Estates plan to investigate them financially. This was important to Saint-André as he had enriched himself during the reign of Henri II. As part of their political plans, they sought to detach Navarre from Catherine's government. This Triumvirate politically separated Montmorency from his three Protestant nephews. The Constable informed Coligny that while he desired unity, there could be no repeat of his Palm Sunday service. Montmorency was drawn to the new alignment by the disinterest the regency government took in his advice, his conservative Catholicism and the revolutionary attitude he sensed in the recent demands of the Estates General for an investigation into the doings of the grandees. His eldest son marshal de Montmorency protested against his father's new alliance arguing it was based on unfounded prejudice. Montmorency's religious convictions were however too strong to be overcome by such protests and he responded to his son that a change in his religion would only come about if the state changed - he thus intended to be a good servant of Charles.\nA forged document produced by Protestants in 1562 claimed that the alliance also agreed to work together with España and Savoia towards the extirpation of heresy not only in France but the rest of Europe too and destroy the bloodline and name of the house of Bourbon. Though this document was a forgery, they did seek relations with España and the Papacy, with Montmorency dispatching an agent to the latter to assure the Pope of his Catholic piety. Pius wrote back warmly to Montmorency. Durot describes the alliance as lacking a 'manifesto or program' prior to 1562. Carroll characterises the 'Triuvmirate' at this time as a 'loose agreement to drop old antagonisms during the current crisis'.\nAccording to Chantonnay, the Spanish ambassador, alongside Saint-André, Montmorency and Guise this alliance featured the participation of the marshal de Brissac, duc de Montpensier, and cardinal de Bourbon. Montpensier was a rival of Guise whose wife was close to Catherine, however his religious convictions caused him to align with the Catholic reaction. Alongside the religious motivations of the alliance there was also the matter of access to royal favour. Montmorency and Guise had been shifted out of their pre-eminent positions of authority over the military by the establishment of Navarre as the lieutenant-general of the kingdom. This was a key factor in Montmorency turning his back on his Protestant nephews who remained in royal favour at court. Chantonnay urged the new faction to work towards the defection of Navarre to their party.\nTheir alliance represented just one manifestation of the backlash to toleration. On 14 April there were clashes in Paris between a Protestant congregation and a Catholic crowd in several places in the city. On 24 April students of the Université de Paris descended upon Protestants who were singing psalms on the Pré-aux-Clercs. The Protestants were besieged in the residence of the seigneur de Longjumeau by the angry students. Among those who regularly attended services in Longjumeau's residence were the duc de Longueville and Filippo Strozzi, a cousin of the queens. The several hundred Protestants gathered in the residence armed themselves with pistols. Catherine had Navarre raise the matter with the rector of the university to express the crowns disapproval at the actions of the students. The parlement of Paris by contrast ordered Longjumeau exiled from Paris on 28 April. Guise rode as an escort to protect the priests of the Corpus Christi procession. Furious Parisians almost burned down the hôtel of Condé's wife Éléonore de Roye due to the public preaching she undertook in the residence. Around the same time the palace of cardinal de Châtillon (in Beauvais where he was bishop) was invaded by an angry crowd of rioters after he celebrated the last supper in the Genevan fashion. Coligny also had his son baptised according to Calvinist rites. A priest suspected of Protestant sympathies was also killed by a crowd in Beauvais, with his body being burned in the market square. Felipe II was also concerned by developments in France and he instructed his ambassadors to warn Catherine against any policy of toleration. Felipe was concerned the growth of Protestantism in France posed a threat to his dominion of Nederland. His representative in Nederland, the cardinal de Granvelle wrote to him that he was astonished things weren't more disordered in Nederland given the example of their neighbour.\nDuring March, Monluc, in alliance with other Catholic lords of the south-west such as the baron de Fumel produced a manifesto to be submitted to the king, offering their services to rid him and the kingdom of the Protestants. This set them up in opposition to the more moderate lieutenant-general of Guyenne, the seigneur de Burie.\nLorraine celebrated Easter at his archbishopric of Reims with all his brothers aside from Guise, and Marie Stuart.\nOn Easter Monday Guise retired from court to his château de Nanteuil, while Montmorency departed from court to be present for the marriage of his son the seigneur de Thoré to Léonore d'Humières. Catherine was at first furious with Guise, seeing him as responsible for the failure to achieve unity at the court and weakening her son the king.\nAs 1561 proceeded Navarre oscillated back and forth between public displays of Protestantism and affirmations of his Catholicity. While this has traditionally been seen as an indecisive flaw in his character, Jouanna argues that it was a far more strategic process by which he sought to fish for concessions from España for his loyalty.\nAt this time, Guise and Lorraine attempted to secure a new marriage for their now widowed niece, hoping to see Marie Stuart married to the heir to the Spanish throne Don Carlos. Lorraine also entered contact with the Emperor who proposed a marriage between Marie and his son the Erzherzog (archduke).  Catherine strongly opposed these manoeuvres, seeing in it an attempt by the Lorraine princes to secure an alliance that could be used against her. On the matter, she described them as 'those who had become accustomed to being kings'. Catherine made an alternate proposal, offering her daughter Marguerite as a match for the Spanish prince. The project would not come to pass. Felipe for his part, was beginning to re-evaluate his interests in France, he was now seeing Guise as the greater defender of his interests, where in the past he had seen Montmorency.\nThe court set out for the coronation of the king on 1 May, stopping at Nanteuil so that they could enjoy Guise's hospitality. On 15 May 1561 the young Charles was coronated at Reims. The ceremony was long, with three oaths sworn by the new king. He was anointed seven times before being dressed in a purple mantle decorated with fleurs de lys. The premier prince du sang Navarre then placed the crown on the young king's head with the assistance of his son. Exhausted by the ceremony and the weight of the clothes the young king spent most of the ceremony crying, which was viewed as a poor omen by those present. During the ceremony there was a dispute over precedence between constable de Montmorency, who expected to enjoy the position of first among the peers of the realm for the ceremony, and Catherine, who wished her son Anjou to have seniority over all other peers. It would only be in 1576 that princes du sang were raised above other peers in seniority. Cardinal de Châtillon was the only representative of the Protestant high nobility present for the coronation. He had brought with him his wife Elizabeth de Hauteville which was a cause of considerable scandal for a cardinal. Condé, Coligny, Longueville, Marshal Montmorency and Damville all absented themselves due to a lack of desire to participate in the mass. According to the earl of Hertford those who did attend demonstrated a low level of interest. In retaliation for his failure to attend the coronation mass, Guise broke off his daughters marital engagement to Longueville. Guise opined that he would rather marry his daughter to a 'poor gentleman' than Longueville. Lorraine warned the young king during the ceremony that anyone who sought to change his religion would also be taking the crown from his head.\nFrom the coronation, the court travelled to the estates of Lorraine at Marchais-Liesse, then from there on to those of the Constable in Picardie. Catherine raised Château-Porcien to the status of a principality in June in favour of the Protestant prince de Porcien.\n\n\n=== Estates of Pontoise ===\n\nThe Estates reconvened in Pontoise for the second part of their meeting. The Estates were opened on 27 August with the Second and Third Estate due to hold their discussions at Pontoise while the First Estate would work from Poissy. The speaker of the Third Estate, the mayor of Autun plead the poverty of the commons, who could only offer the king their loyalty. The speaker of the Third Estate further opined that freedom of conscience was a natural right of the king's subjects. Moreover, he alleged that religious diversity in the kingdom was the product of the passion the king's subjects had for the safety of their souls. Both the Second and Third Estate (nobility and commons) launched a concerted attack on the First Estate. They jointly proposed that the crown resolve its financial quagmire by selling off all church property. They estimated that the crown could generate 120,000,000 livres by such sales. Of this 120,000,000, 42,000,000 would be put towards the crown's debts while 48,000,000 would be invested in such a way as to generate 4,000,000 a year in incomes for the clergy. The final 30,000,000 would be loaned to private individuals who would work for the economic betterment of the realm. Montmorency was horrified by the statements of the Third Estate, and proposed that the speaker be hanged. The Third Estates' proposal greatly alarmed the First Estate (clergy), who hurriedly entered into an agreement with the crown by which they would provide an annual subsidy of 1,600,000 livres for six years. By this means the crown would be able to redeem alienate domains and revenues. This agreement was known as the 'contract of Poissy'. Though not quite what they had originally proposed, the concessions of the clergy provided the crown some financial relief.\nIn return for providing this relief to the crown, the bishops secured the right to meet and manage the specifics of the subsidies they had offered. Despite these concessions, the crown would still sell off clerical land for funds, engaging in this practice for the first time in 1563. Once the Estates had dispersed, the crown unilaterally imposed a new tax on wine without their approval.\n\n\n=== Explosion of Protestantism ===\nIn Autumn 1561, the fortunes of Protestantism were on the rise. Among the nobility they could represent sizeable proportions of the population: 19% of the nobles of Beauce, around 33% of those in Quercy. The nobles who converted tended to be young and sensitive to the honour of their house. For the converters there was a mixture of religious conviction, social and political drives towards Protestantism. Among the broader population Babelon estimates Protestants made up around 2,000,000 of France's population of 17/18,000,000 at this time. In a petition submitted to the crown in early 1562, the Protestant petitioner would estimate that they held 2,150 churches in the kingdom the resources of which they assured they would devote to the interests of the crown. So many Protestant pastors were dispatched from Genève to France that the pulpits of Genève were left empty (Lausanne was left with no preachers for a time). Of forty four pastors who can be concretely identified fourteen at least were nobles. This included visits from the leading pastors de Bèze, Jean-Raymond Merlin and Guillaume Farel. Farel set himself up at Gap and became the centre of activism across Dauphiné. Pierre Viret preached in Nîmes (where an academy would be set up for the training of further preachers), Montpellier and Lyon, the latter of which he would remain in during 1562. Merlin established himself in Coligny's household for several months before he was called back to Genève. It was even said that the Protestant Admiral Coligny would be the new governor of the young king. Catherine allowed her children to recite their prayers in French and permitted them to sing the psalms. The cardinal d'Armagnac and di Ferrara were both invited to the residence of the queen of Navarre where they were witness to a sermon by a Protestant preacher and the singing of psalms. In this atmosphere of greater religious freedom, many Protestants began to practice their religion, though it remained officially illegal.\nThe greatest manifestation of the courtly Protestantism at this period was the celebration of the marriage between Jean de Rohan (a cousin of the queen of Navarre) and Diane de Barbançon on 29 September at Argenteuil. De Bèze performed the rites for the new couple. Coligny and the queen of Navarre selected the date of 29 September for the festivities, by this means allowing the Protestant nobles an excuse to avoid attending the yearly Mass for the Ordre de Saint-Michel that was to be held on that day. Catholics protested against the holding of the ceremony but no royal action followed.\nFifteen new chevaliers de l'ordre de Saint-Michel were created by Catherine in late 1561. They were all clients of the Bourbon and Châtillon, well inclined towards the course of toleration if not themselves Protestants. As a result, a majority of the chevaliers were in support of the new royal policy.\nSome Protestants went further and attacked what they saw as symbols of 'Popery', engaging in acts of iconoclasm. Through iconoclasm, attacks on churches and priests, Protestants hoped to destroy the Catholic church itself through the scattering of the organisations assets. The relics of saints were cast from their shrines and burned in fires. They also hoped that it would be an educational tool, showing the 'credulous' Catholics still subject to the 'superstitions' of the church that the items of Catholic dogma were not in fact untouchable. Through the violent declaration of their faith embodied by iconoclasm, the possibilities of martyrdom were also afforded. Many Catholics would instead react with horror. As early as 24 February 1561 the Protestants had assumed control of the church of Issigeac near Bergerac and began to 'purify' it of 'idolatrous images and items'. As 1561 went on this campaign broadened, Vienne in March; Sauve in July; Montauban and its surrounds in August; Montpellier, Nîmes and their subsidiary villages in September and October, Orange in November and December; Agen in December. From the middle of 1561 onwards the iconoclasm was accompanied by occupations armed or otherwise. The iconoclasm was most profoundly felt in le Midi (southern France). A Spanish bishop travelling through the country on the way to the council of Trent reported that the only diocese he passed through which was untroubled by religious disorders was Narbonne. Wood's analysis of violent Protestant acts in the 1560s sees the epicentre of attacks as being in Guyenne and Languedoc. The notables in the Protestant movement sought to blame such violent action on the 'lower class' elements of the Protestant movement, the artisans and peasants. One synod would chide their Protestant community that it was the duty of the magistrates to remove superstitious idolatry, not private individuals.\nAcross France in this period, the nascent Protestant church was arming and organising itself. Each church had the responsibility to support a horsed soldier (either by equipping them or funding their expenses), each synod was subordinate to a military leader, every church was to have a captain. For example, Guyenne was divided into seven colloquies each led by a captain, beneath them were colonels and then captains of individual Protestant communities. The individual churches were not supposed to be autonomous military entities, and were meant to take direction from their colloquy. Their military ranks were swelled by those who had been demobilised in the austerity of François II's reign. With this paramilitary backing, church seizures were undertaken, to bring new temples into the fold of Genevan worship.\nCatholic fears particularly focused on the seditious threat that this Protestant growth threatened. However, Protestants in general preferred to acquire control of their local cities through infiltration and co-option of the mechanisms of urban government. With local offices under their control they could intervene in favour of their coreligionists. This strategy achieved inroads in Rouen, Tours, Amiens and Caen in the north. In the south the successes were far more widespread, with Protestant administrative successes occurring in Nîmes, Montpellier, Montauban, Toulouse, Castres, Valence, Béziers, Pézenas, Montagnac, Rabastens, Revel, Lavaur and Gaillac.\nProtestant direct action in many circumstances revolved around the freeing of their brethren from both jail and the executioners block. Such jailbreaks occurred in Rouen, Nantes, La Réole, Sainte-Foy-la-Grande and Laplume.\nCalvin's attitude towards Protestant compromise hardened in this period. He entered dispute with the Protestant Baudouin, derisively describing him as a 'moyenneur' for his willingness to seek concord in a way Calvin viewed as compromising the faith. Calvin therefore advised his right-hand man de Bèze to limit himself to a defence of only the first two centuries of church history at the upcoming conference of Poissy, where in prior years he had been willing to accept the first 400–500 years of the 'primitive church' as legitimate.\n\n\n==== Bishops ====\nThe bishop of Troyes, a protégé of Catherine, made the decision to convert to Protestantism. He had concern that his conversion would necessitate the renouncing of his benefice and material possessions. He wrote to Calvin who assured him he could maintain the temporal wealth of the church if he used it for the relief of the poor. Thus he renounced some of his benefices while maintaining others. The bishop would style himself Antoine, bishop and minister of the Holy Gospel.\nThe bishops of Chartres and Senlis became notorious with the Catholic ultras for their unorthodox views. Both were cited for investigation by the inquisition in 1561. The formers toleration of Protestants would be such that a decade later he would be a target during the St Bartholomew's Day massacre.\nSeveral bishops (the bishops of Cahors, Chalon-sur-Saône and Coutances) were captured by local Protestants in 1561 and held for ransom. The bishop of Cahors was released after a ransom of 1,000 écus was paid in 1562, while that of Coutances escaped disguised as a miller and the bishop of Chalon-sur-Saône was only released after the conclusion of the first war of religion in March 1563.\nIn response to the Protestant seizure of churches, the archbishop of Albi took charge of 300 men during 1561 who successfully recaptured the church of Saint-Pierre in Albi from the Protestants. The archbishop, a cousin of the queen mother, had been tasked by Catherine with pacifying the region by any means necessary. That same year the cardinal d'Armagnac who was also the bishop of Rodez summoned the local clergy to arm themselves so that they might seize back the churches of Villefranche. Armagnac distributed arms among the several hundred clergy who answered the call. They would not for the moment succeed in re-securing Villefranche for Catholicism. Many Catholic preachers denounced Catherine and her policy of toleration.\n\n\n==== Île de France ====\nIn the capital, the governor (the prince de La Roche-sur-Yon) militarily enforced a de facto toleration of Protestantism during this period.\nCatherine asked the duc de Guise to participate in the capital's Corpus Christi procession out of fear that the Protestants were planning to disrupt the celebration. Indeed, Guise received several couriers requesting his presence. According to Brantôme, Guise answered the call 'for the honour of god'. He escorted the procession on horseback. By now he was beginning to build a reputation among the common people of the city as a defender of Catholicism and at the procession he was a centre of attention. Indeed, Brantôme argues the Parisians were of the opinion that if not for his presence there would have been scandal and disruption to the procession. Lorraine who was also recalled to the capital played the central role in the feast of the Octaves of Corpus Christi, leading the 'body of the lord' in a procession then conducting the mass at Saint-Germain-des-Prés.\nBy late 1561 Montmorency and the bishop of Paris were looking towards the 'reconquest' of the city for the Catholic faith. To this end lists were drawn up of declared Protestants in the capital, with the pair determining there were around 4–5,000 Protestants in the city. Saint-André undertook a similar census of Protestants in Lyon.\nDisorder increasingly consumed the city, with the students of the Sorbonne travelling to Mass under arms, and various armed bands wandering the streets. In hopes of soothing the situation, La Roche-sur-Yon was replaced with Marshal Montmorency as governor of the city.\nDuring October, Catherine informed the Protestants of Paris to only meet in secret and in numbers less than 200. By this means the governor would be able to protect them. De Bèze despaired at how in defiance of this order, thousands would gather. On 12 October, after around 7,000-8,000 Protestants had departed from the city gates to worship outside the walls, a group of Catholics closed the gates on them. The Protestants tried to fight their way back into the city and several were seriously injured in the scuffle that followed. A week later, the crown ordered that the population of Paris be disarmed.\nFour theologians in Paris who had decided to debate whether the Pope could depose a heretical or tyrannical king were arrested. Another preacher named Artus Desiré called for aid from Felipe II to combat Protestantism in France.\nOn 10 December, a radical Catholic preacher named Jean de Hans who regularly made inflammatory sermons (such as one predicting the ruin of the kingdom if the crown's policy towards Protestantism did not change), was arrested on the orders of the king, so that he might explain himself at the château de Saint-Germain. Paris exploded in outrage at the arrest, and the crown yielded to a delegation of Parisian merchants who came to court to protest the arrest, releasing the preacher, who departed in triumph. Radical monks preached at Saint-Merry, Saint-Eustache and Saint-Jacques de la Boucherie in defiance of investigations from the parlement of Paris.\n\n\n==== Bourgogne ====\n\nIn June the election for mayor of Dijon was contested between a militant Catholic and a Protestant candidate. Despite the efforts of the Protestant community of Dijon they were unable to get their candidate elected.\nA serious disturbance was narrowly avoided in Dijon on the evening before All Saints Day as Catholics threw stones at Protestants as they went to their illegal service which was being held across from the hôtel de ville (city hall). Both Catholic and Protestant were dispersed by the mayor and syndic with soldiers. The cities ban on illicit assemblies was then re-affirmed. On All Saints Day proper the Protestants undertook a large demonstration through the city centre. Alarmed, the Catholic vignerons (wine growers) rang the tocsin and assembled to confront what they assumed to be a coup attempt, in the scuffle that followed a Catholic dyer was killed. In the wake of this the city plead for the crown to take action against Protestantism, and for the lieutenant-general Tavannes to come to Dijon personally so the community could be secure while Protestantism was purged. Tavannes agreed to work together with the mayor towards the extirpation of Protestantism. He issued prohibitions against the singing of psalms in French, an act many Catholics found insulting. Many were arrested as a result of these prohibitions. The parlement of Dijon moved to arrest all the involved Protestants.\nThe elder of the Maligny brothers, who had been involved in the conspiracy of Amboise in the previous year, fortified himself in Bourgogne in a heavily protected château around 20 km away from Auxerre. Despite the orders of Catherine that he be arrested, the lieutenant-general of Bourgogne Tavannes felt the matter was not possible due to the many friends Maligny possessed in the area.\n\n\n==== Champagne ====\nDuring 1561, the countryside of Champagne was plagued by a company of marauders under the command of a 'colonel Beaulieu'. The seigneurs de La Motte-Tilly and d'Esternay led a combined force of nobles and common people to crush Beaulieu's force. They succeeded in hunting down Beaulieu's force, with many captives being brought to Provins. Beaulieu and the band were able to buy their freedom however.\nDisorder was not a universal state of affairs in the kingdom. When the lieutenant-general of Champagne, the seigneur de Barbezieulx wrote to the town of Châlons in November, to acquire of the state of policing in the city during this tumultuous period, he was informed that there was no disorder in Châlons, nor any sign there would be any in the future.\n\n\n==== Picardie ====\n\nOn 3 October Condé received the post of governor of Picardie, replacing Brissac in the responsibility. It was impossible for the crown to overlook Condé's landed wealth in Picardie, not to mention the Protestant inclinations of much of the senior nobility of the region. A large number of his 200 estates were in Picardie, and his wife's lands were centred there. He quickly began exercising his new charge. The lieutenant-general of the province under Condé would be the Protestant sieur de Sénarpont, meanwhile the governor of Boulogne and the Boulonnais was the Protestant seigneur de Morvilliers. The governor of Abbeville, Robert de Saint-Delys|the seigneur d'Hercourt]], was a Protestant client of Coligny's. While the governor of Calais, the sieur de Gourdan, was not a Protestant, the twelve mercenary companies who filled the city were under the command of the Protestant d'Andelot. Other important Picard nobles, the sieur de Genlis and the sieur d'Ivoy were also Protestant and flocked to affiliate themselves with Condé. To compensate Brissac for his dispossession, his son was to be offered the post of colonel of the infantry in French Piemonte.\nProtestant confidence grew in Amiens as their presence as city échevins expanded. The Protestant échevins worked to ensure their co-religionists who did not engage in disorders were protected from Catholic attack. On 6 December a Protestant service at the residence of the baron de Dompmartin was subject to an attack by Catholics who burst in, chased the Protestants, burned the ministers chair and looted the residence. Several échevins tried to intervene in the situation but were unsuccessful. The following day came the Protestant revenge as the cathedral was invaded during Vespers with the interior trashed. During the confrontation, some were wounded. In the estimation of the Protestant échevins the bishop was to blame for the disorders, and he was informed that he needed to restrain the radical sermons of the clergy. Arrests were also undertaken of some 200 people, with the judge who was to try them being replaced due to his perceived sympathies to the radical Catholic faction and hatred of Protestants.\n\n\n==== Normandie ====\nIn Normandie, the governor the duc de Bouillon visited his governate for the second ever time in 1561. Though a Protestant, he had poor ties with the local Protestant nobility of Normandie. Instead of rallying around him, they looked to other nobles such as the comte de Montgommery, the d'Agneaux and Sainte-Marie families. Bouillon was left largely impotent in terms of his own power. The Catholics of the province looked to the lieutenant-generals the sieur de Villebon and the seigneur de Matignon. Despite his weak ties with the Protestant nobility of Normandie, Bouillon instructed his deputies to see that Protestantism was tolerated in his governate.\nIn Rouen the Protestants attacked the portal of the cathedral, during the conduct of a Lenten sermon. The crowd then invaded the cathedral and denounced the friar as fat. Parlementaires associated with Guise were subject to threats and attacks. The governor of Normandie, the duc de Bouillon visited the city in July and expressed his desire to see order maintained. However he also gave his implicit approval for non-disruptive Protestant worship. In late 1561, the cardinal de Bourbon visited Rouen, a rare visit for a city which was technically his diocese. The Protestants of the city greeted him with scorn, showering him with insults, and dressing up his pulpit with a broadsheet of a flock of geese (a way of calling him a king of liars). When a Rouennais citizen was found in possession of a list of 400 of the cities leading Protestants in September, he was executed on suspicion of being involved in anti-Protestant plot by a commission led by the duc de Bouillon. It was reported the executed man had correspondence from Lorraine and Catherine. By November the Protestants felt confident enough to worship openly in the Halles.\nAs early as 1560 Protestantism's growth in Caen had already been strong with nine of the eleven councillors on the présidial court being Protestant. Dauvin characterises the city as one in which conversion could be conducted with impunity. The présidial body was venal which facilitated its easy co-option. A Protestant also controlled the chief financial office of the city responsible for tax collection (the receveur). Of those revenues which were farmed out, a majority were administered by Protestants. Protestantism took on an elite character in the city which aided its success in the triennial municipal elections. By this time around a third of the population was Protestant. Dauvin is unable to find a crisis in the cities Catholicism that explains the rapid growth of Protestantism, and looks instead to the cities commercial contacts, fiscal discontent and the presence of the university. In the absence of the governor of the city, Montmorency, Caen was governed by the Catholic captain of the château the sieur d'Hugueville, however he had few military resources at his disposal. As a result of the lack of resources the city was vulnerable to Protestant insurrection. Protestant strength was also to be found in the bourgeois militia where Protestant men comprised a majority.\nOf the four Protestant échevins elected for Caen in 1561, one Michel de Le Bigne, was likely a cousin of La Renaudie's secretary during the conspiracy of Amboise. The registers of the baillage record disorders on religious grounds going back to 1560 when reports of iconoclasm appear. Alongside iconoclasm, the problem of printing of illicit books began to be felt in Caen. Protestant judges oversaw the arrest of their co-religionists on this matter as when several were arrested in May 1561 on suspicion of having published in favour of the abolition of the mass.\nIn August of that year, in the north of the kingdom at the trade fair of Guibray in Normandie, Protestants were present in force. A preacher was able to bring forth a crowd of 5-6000 Protestant's. When confronted with Catholic rosary bead manufacturers they began a riot and drove the Catholics from the fair. Protestants ran through the fair with swords, intimidating any who sang against their cause. There was a class divide in the religious violence, many humbler converts not desirous of waiting for the authorities to convert before bringing about the reformation.\nSeveral Protestants who had attempted to distribute a version of the 1534 Lutheran placards at the Guibray fair were arrested on the orders of the premier président of Caen.\nSome time in 1561, Protestants assumed control of Érnee in Normandie. Guise made a request of the junior lieutenant-general of Bretagne, the sieur de Bouillé to reconquer the town. Bouillé informed the governor of Bretagne that even though Érnee was outside his governate he had crossed the border to recapture the town, both due to the friendship Étampes had for the duc de Guise and due to the security risk of having a Protestant town on the border.\n\n\n==== Bretagne ====\n\nA structured Protestant church had existed in Nantes since the Autumn of 1560. In July 1561 the Protestants of Nantes made a show of strength, parading through the porte Saint-Pierre under arms. Rumours swirled that they intended to seize one of the gates. A large reaction followed, with a Catholic riot on 1 August that destroyed a building in which worship was being conducted. The owner of the house petitioned for compensation from governor d'Étampes and this was granted. The junior lieutenant-generals of Bretagne, the marquis de Bouillé joined the protest of the city administration of Nantes against the Edict of July to Étampes, the edicts mild language would in Bouillé's estimation only further disorders.\nIn the Autumn of 1561 the community had the strength to get the establishment of sites for Protestant worship added into their cahiers over the objections of the local First Estate. A Catholic petition protested against the Protestant move for churches, pleading with the king to ensure that no faith other than Catholicism was celebrated in the city. D'Andelot advocated for the Protestant community of Nantes personally, writing to the lieutenant-general of Bretagne the vicomte de Martigues, who authorised the provision of a church in November. It would be burned down within a month by members of the cathedral chapter. In retaliation for the burning down of their church, the Protestants invaded the cathedral on horseback and threw projectiles at the altar. Several members of the city administration were denounced as 'capital enemies' by the more intolerant Catholics for their implied Protestant sympathies. The cities governor Sanzay and the conseil des bourgeois agreed the appropriate response to the invasion of the cathedral was the prohibition of Protestant assemblies and a reinforced guard on the gate.\nCatherine felt the need in 1561, to ask the duc d'Étampes, governor of Bretagne, to publicly declare his support for her government. Étampes would likewise request that Catherine and the king to send him letters he could show the nobles of Bretagne to give them courage that he enjoyed their favour.\n\n\n==== Touraine ====\nThe mayor of Tours was a Protestant, and had been since 1559. In October the Protestants of Tours had seized control of the church of the Franciscans only to be dislodged by Montpensier in his capacity as governor of Touraine.\nVarious disorders in Tours in late 1561 caused the court to dispatch the secrétaire d'État de Laubespine to the city. De Laubespine reported to Guise that the garrison had been distributed through the city. The people of Tours begged him to intercede with Guise and the crown in their defence. He therefore further informed Guise that the trouble makers had departed from the city, and therefore if any punishment was meted out against Tours, it would be against the innocent. Further he argued that the royal commander Richelieu was a rough man, and feeding his men at the expense of the people of Tours.\nMontpensier, who had made himself infamous in his governate with the Protestants in 1560 for his summary conduct, travelled to Touraine to oversee the burial of his mother in July 1561. While in the territory he observed many Protestants, and decided to imprison around 140 of them in the town of Chinon. In response to this action, thousands of Protestants descended upon his residence, besieging him inside until he acquiesced to release those who he had locked up in Chinon.\n\n\n==== Berry ====\nAfter the arrest of Protestants in the Berry town of Issoudun, Coligny wrote to Catherine in their favour in April. He argued that if she looked at what the Protestants had been doing in the town she would find no seditions or any bearing of arms. He therefore implored her to see to their release and grant them permission to live openly in their faith alongside the Catholics.\n\n\n==== Aunis ====\nIn La Rochelle, where Protestantism was dominant, the governor of the pays d'Aunis the seigneur de Jarnac who held authority over the city was only permitted entry in 1561 after the leaders of the city had convinced themselves that his conversion to Protestantism was genuine. He had been appointed to the charge back in 1559.\n\n\n==== Saintonge ====\nIn this region during Lent there were around 38 Protestant pastors preaching sermons.\n\n\n==== Guyenne ====\nIn early 1561, the lieutenant-general of Guyenne the seigneur de Burie made it known that his priority was to see to the defence of Bordeaux, and that the wider region would have to be protected by the local nobility. This was effective for several months but soon began to break down in the face of Protestant attacks.\nBurie played a double game with the Protestants of the province. He allowed the parlement of Bordeaux to issue an arrêt which prohibited Protestant worship, but then secretly told the Protestant community that if they assembled in private he would not trouble them.\nIn the estimation of the contemporary baron de Biron, many lesser seigneurs in the region converted to Protestantism so as to avoid their tax obligations. Corteault observes tax collection increasingly becoming a flashpoint between Catholic lords and their tenants in this period.\nIn June, the comte de Crussol received commission from the crown to investigate what the Protestants of Guyenne were up to. The king informed him that he had heard several thousand pikes had been forged in the province and that the Protestants had raised 80,000 écus towards a planned goal of 450,000 écus. These facts concerned the crown and Crussol was charged with investigating their veracity, and soothing tensions in the troubled province. Burie informed Crussol that the Protestants had attacked churches and required punishment. Crussol did not stay long in Guyenne before being reassigned.\nThe royal order for churches to be restored to their original owners was not distributed in Guyenne out of fear that it would simply provoke a larger backlash.\nIn Bordeaux, the senior Catholic magistracy bemoaned that the Protestants were seeking to introduce their faith at the point of a sword, topple the crown and turn Guyenne into a series of cantons.\nIn February an armed group of the 'basoche' (the Catholic street gang associated with the Bordeaux parlement) marched on the gates of the collège de Guyenne (home of the 'écoliers' the Protestant street gang associated with the collège) intending to storm the collège and attack their enemies. Made aware of what was about to transpire, the parlement despatched soldiers to avoid a bloodbath. This accomplished an arrêt was issued by the parlement which chastised both sides. Both the basoche and écoliers were to relinquish their weapons, the latter were ordered to disestablish their military divisional structure while the former was denied the ability to elect an leader for a period. The Protestant écoliers redirected their attentions less militant illegal activities such as the chanting of psalms. The parlement would charge many of the écoliers who engaged in psalm singing.\nIn May, Burie was offered the services of 4,000 Catholics for the policing of Bordeaux however he refused. The offer was renewed by the parlement in June, with the body highlighting that it would free up professional troops to police the countryside.\nThe captain of the guard was arrested on suspicion of having aided in the jailbreak of several Protestants from prison in September, and after his trial the following April was removed from his post.\nIn late 1561, the parlement attempted to requisition 80 men from the garrisons of the châteaux to augment the city guard. The captains of each château refused, pleading their own insufficient resources. The parlement therefore turned to a Catholic militia formed of their own members. Burie objected, and his objection was only overcome when the militia was subordinated to the jurat (Bordeaux's city council) with oversight from the capitaine du guet (captain of the watch).\nOn 21 November, the Protestants of Bordeaux attempted an assault on the château de Trompette, the key to the cities defence. However, the garrison and its commander remained firm and resisted the assault. This assault was too much for the parlement and in December, after another furious denunciation of Burie's leadership a syndicate of the courts lawyers was formed (with their own militia). After tricking the Protestant members of the body into signing a declaration they were all suspended from the court. The court requested the crown send Catholic troops to the province to restore order. When the moderate premier président of the parlement returned in January 1562 he declared the decisions of the court illegal and denounced their ring leaders.\nOne of Burie's lieutenants named the sieur de Savignac de Thouars was active in the Agenais. The parlementaires of Bordeaux complained to Burie that Savignac was operating a vigilante force of around 2,000 men who were dispensing harsh punishments on the Catholic population. Burie also entrusted the Protestant sieur de Mesmy with leading one of the patrols in the region, but he was so despised by the Catholics that when captured in 1562 he would be summarily executed on the orders of the Bordeaux parlement.\nIn Clairac, Tonneins, Montflanquin and Saint-Livrade reports arrived to Burie by August that the Catholic priests had been chased from their churches. In Villeneuve, Penne and Nérac it was the Cordeliers who had been removed from their monasteries by the Protestants.\nIn August Protestants undertook attacks on two châteaux, those of Thouars and Frégimont. These belonged to the seigneur de Montpezat. Montpezat enjoyed a brutal reputation in the Agenais, and had conducted attacks on the Protestant churches of Libos, Tournon and La Plume. A key figure in the Protestant opposition to Montpezat was the seigneurs elder brother Antoine de Montpezat who had been disinherited by their father. The elder brother had converted to Protestantism and as early as 1558 led attacks on the châteaux of Lagnac and Frégimont.\n\nIn February Monluc returned to Agen and authorised the consuls of the town to guard the gates. By this means he hoped to make visible the Catholic coalitions responsibility for the protection of the city. The militia was expanded at this time. The treasures of the cathedral and the churches were moved to a nearby château for their protection. They then turned to attack the Protestants for the recent disorders.\nThe crown, keen to avoid escalation, imposed a truce on the region. The militia was stood down, Monluc's forces withdrew from Agen and Protestants were allowed to attend the councils once more. Catholic grandees were unhappy that the amnesty meant that Protestant prisoners would be released, and soon the military council was revived. The crown received various petitions from the Catholics highlighting the armed Protestant gatherings for worship, causing the crown to respond with a ban on gatherings at the risk of fines and imprisonment.\nAfter acts of Protestant iconoclasm in Agen, the Protestant minister of the city decided to work alongside the judiciary of the city to aid in seeing those responsible punished. In the ministers fears, the iconoclasm threatened to take on the character of rebellion which might disrupt the social order.\nProtestant artisans oversaw the conduct of iconoclasm in the city and bemoaned that if they waited for their consistory (administrative body of the fledgeling church) to act nothing would ever happen. The Protestants of Agen reported to Calvin in September that they had banished Catholicism from the city and surrounding area. This purge of Catholicism involved some violence, and thus the lieutenant of Bordeaux was preparing to suppress them, bringing together men that even included those of the king of Navarre. The report to Calvin noted with concern that the Protestants weapons might be seized as part of this process.\nAfter having visited various communities of both faiths across the Agenais counselling patience, Burie arrived in Agen on 3 October. He argued that confrontation was not the answer and proposed that when intervention was required from higher authorities, that the city look to the sénéchal d'Agenais to resolve matters. Burie was able to get the city council to agree to a bi-confessional chamber on 20 October.\nThe Catholics of Agen grew to develop a distaste for the bi-confessional chamber arguing it was too lenient on the Protestants. In January 1562 they gained the agreement of the sénéchal d'Agenais that Protestants needed to be excluded from the jurade and présidial court, he concurred.\nA famous incident occurred in Fumel in November. The baron de Fumel's château was approached by a furious band of rioters. This band of rioters contained both Protestant and Catholic peasants. Fumel (the former French ambassador to the Osmanlı İmparatorluğu) was a brutal lord known for ruthlessly enforcing his seigneurial prerogatives. He also had a history of dispersing Protestant gatherings in his domains. It was in response to this that the Protestant consistory had issued a call to arms. He appeared on his terrace and was struck by several salvos from sharpshooter rioters below. The people of the town of Fumel, who were largely complicit in the assassination closed their gates, meanwhile the crossings over the Lot were guarded, this allowed the assassination to occur without interference from other authorities. When the baron's servants attempted to locate a doctor, they were arrested and detained in the house of the urban consuls. The rioters set the entrance to the château on fire and invade the residence, finding the baron wounded in bed. He was stabbed to death with various implements. The château was then pillaged, while the baron's wife and son were terrorised before being taken off to the prison of Fumel. The papers and records in the château are also burned. Denouncing him as a 'wicked persecutor' the baron's killers then departed singing psalms. Though the sénéschal of Agen would soon see that the baron received a proper burial, the people of Fumel would spend the next several months keeping Fumel isolated from the outside world.\nWhile it is certain some of those involved in the Fumel affair were Protestant, it is unlikely all were. Nevertheless, the affair was quickly worked into anti-Protestant propaganda. The parlement of Bordeaux ignored the participation of Catholic peasants in their characterisation of the event as a Protestant revolt. Also ignored was the fact that the Cluniac priory and Fumel's church were left untouched. In Carroll's examination of the named suspects, he observes that there were 44 artisans and 14 notables among their number, but no nobleman. The local Protestant nobleman remained aloof from involvement. Crouzet's analysis of the named suspects highlights many of the involved were not Fumel's tenants and came from elsewhere. He therefore argues in favour of a religious motivation. Monluc would be charged in 1562 with leading the suppression of this particular revolt. He sequestered 8 hardliner Catholic officials from Agen to sit on a judicial panel. He had around 30-40 Protestants in Fumel hanged. The houses of around 200 participants were to be razed and the town of Fumel stripped of its liberties (and walls) with a fine of 320,000 livres to pay as reparation. Notably however the ring leaders of the killing escaped punishment. Monluc's narrative of the crime highlighted it as an illustration of the revolutionary societal foundation shaking tenets of Protestantism. By this means it was hoped to scare off the nobility from sympathy with Protestantism. It also served for Monluc as justification for the brutal campaign he had been waging against Gascon Protestants in the proceeding months. According to Monluc, the attacks on Fumel were only one part of a larger series of planned attacks, and it was only by his executions that he stopped a similar rising at Saint-Mézard. The organiser in his estimation was a lawyer from Lectoure who was a client of Navarre's. Throughout this time however, Monluc was in the business of intimidation, not combat. It is only in April 1562 neither siege nor military engagement were in his repertoire.\nRural peasants in the Garonne valley did not content themselves with burning churches and abbeys, but further attacked châteaux, sometimes even going after the seigneur as part of the attack. In August the seigneur de Levignac was forced to flee his château after it was attacked by around '2,000 thieves'. Levignac's neighbours, the sieurs de Lestelle and Thouars also had their residences ransacked. Carroll opines that a state of civil war already existed in Guyenne in 1561.\nIn Marmande the convent of the Cordeliers was razed by Protestant vigilantes with several killed in the process.\n\n\n==== Foix ====\nThe Protestants of Foix engaged in the looting of the cities churches during December. The Protestant minister of the city attempted to intervene to stop them, however he was seized by his co-religionists and dragged off back to his home.\n\n\n==== Languedoc ====\nMontmorency, and his lieutenant-general in Languedoc, Joyeuse came in for stern rebuke from Catherine in early October. She ordered that the repression conducted by Joyeuse in the province by moderated, and chided the constable for the many complaints rising up from the province. Montmorency, not used to such criticism from the crown took solace in the fact he was being attacked for his religion. Joyeuse was instructed to allow the Protestants to see to their own regulation and discipline.\nThe lettres de cachet provided by the crown for religious prisoners were greeted cooly by the parlement of Toulouse. After stalling in their registration, they adopted a strict approach to their execution, with all released prisoners made to swear their abjuration. The comte de Crussol protested that they modified the edict so greatly that it was almost 'formed anew'.\nIn March, one of the  capitouls of Toulouse (leaders of the civic government), participated in the provincial estates of Languedoc and during their course proposed that royal finance be resolved through the alienation of church property. Such a proposal was greeted with horror by some Catholic parlementaires who went to court to argue that instead Protestant property should be put towards the royal debt.\nBy 1561 the Protestant students of the university were growing increasingly confident in their militancy. Around 400 gathered outside the house of the premier président of the parlement to demand a place for Protestant worship. The students regularly clashed with the basochiens (musicians and actors who performed at Catholic ceremonies composed of members of the courts of Toulouse) despite attempts to see each side disarmed and the students kept from roaming the city. The city guard struggled to maintain order between the groups, and found itself forced to ask for support from other bodies in keeping order.\nIn response to this, the capitouls raised a subsidiary force of 100 men to be subordinated to the captain of the guard. Even this was proving insufficient by late 1561 and the capitouls raised further citizens into supporting roles. The Catholic dominated parlement took issue with these moves, arguing the new guardsmen were disproportionately Protestant and that this Protestant guard was inviting more of their coreligionists through the cities gates. The parlement estimated there were around 4,000 Protestants in the city.\nOn 1 September the sieur de Terride was appointed as governor of Toulouse in the hopes of quieting the troubles. He garrisoned all his forces in the city and removed the capitouls authority over the guard. The capitouls were incensed at this insult on their urban privileges and Terride's militant Catholic credentials. In December they succeeded in getting Terride recalled by the crown, to be replaced by the comte de Crussol. The appointment of Crussol was greeted with horror by the Catholics of Toulouse.\nA Protestant consistory was established in Toulouse in January 1562. A Catholic syndicate formed in opposition. It was led by two présidents of the parlement from March 1562. \nThe bishop of Montpellier fled his city in July. Joyeuse, lieutenant-general of Languedoc, despaired in a letter to Montmorency about the situation in Montpellier on 30 September. He highlighted to Montmorency that he had only 50 arquebusiers to his name, and that the seizure of the great church of Our Lady in Montpellier had been undertaken by a group of 3,000 Protestants. Further his force had to be spread across a province which was increasingly falling to Protestant control. In his estimation the Protestants had secured Lavaur, Réalmont, Rabastens, Revel and Castres.\nAround 19 October, the garrison and clergy camped out in the cathedral of Saint-Pierre as the Protestants attempted to seize the building. A shot was fired by one of the defenders, which led to an explosion of rage from the Protestants. Over the next few days the cathedral was captured and subject to a thorough pillage, with 30-40 Catholics killed, among whom were 3 canons.  The Protestant consuls of Montpellier tried to organise inventories of the captured objects and avoid looting but this was in vain.\nIn Montauban, Protestants compelled a priest to ride a donkey upside down while holding its tail. The priest was dragged to the square where their vestments were burned and the host trampled. In August the drive to iconoclasm saw all statues destroyed be they in public churches or private residences, with paintings also attacked wherever they were found.\nThe consistory of Nîmes declared that they deferred to the court in matters of acquiring churches, and in the meanwhile the seizure of churches was prohibited. The opposition to church seizure was expressed in a letter to the Protestant community of Montpellier during August. Nevertheless, in September Nîmois Protestants, led by men of high birth, seized the church of the Franciscans in the city. Though the Protestant consistory of the city protested that they were uncomfortable with such violent acts, they voted by a decision of 7–5 to accept the acquisition of the first seized church. This was justified on the grounds that its acquisition had not required violence, and that they needed it. Those who had taken it were to be punished however. Pierre Viret who visited Nîmes would preach in the church in early October. The consistory placed guards on the church and informed a nearby community it could emulate Nîmes, as long as any seizures didn't involve bloodshed. During October the consistory began to militarise, with the establishment of a militia under the command of eight captains. In total there would be four Protestant attacks on the churches of Nîmes in 1561 (29 September and 8, 15 and 21 December). On 15 December the bishop of Nîmes was intimidated by crowds into handing two more churches to the Protestants. He was forced to flee from the cathedral after an iconoclastic riot invaded the premises on 21 December, heading to Arles. The violence moved from a desire to acquire places of worship to a desire to eliminate Catholicism from the city as the year progressed.\nOn 6 December a new consular election was held. The crown proved unwilling to replicate the imposition of Catholic consuls that it had undertaken by coup the prior year. Therefore, the Protestants, who had grown considerably in strength since the last election were able to dominate the process in numbers.  The Catholic nominations of the outgoing consuls was disregarded by the electors who almost all voted for Protestant candidates.\nAs early as October several members of religious houses in Millau abandoned their orders. The Protestants of Millau were not content to leave abandonment to voluntary choice, and over the next several months the various religious houses of Millau were broken into with the inhabitants threatened by masked men. Finally the convent of the Celestines was set on fire.\nIn Villefranche, a Protestant was assassinated by a sniper lodged in the bell tower of the Cordeliers convent. In revenge some Protestants killed a priest during the pronouncement of mass on 22 July.\nDuring October, the lieutenant-general of Languedoc Joyeuse found himself in trouble with the crown for his role in a violent episode against the Protestants of Béziers. One of his subordinates had become involved in an incident the result of which was several dead. The crown chastised Joyeuse for such a 'great scandal'.\nOn 19 November, a group of Protestants were worshipping in a private house in Cahors. A group of Catholics who were assembling for mass became aware of this. The house in which the Protestants were worshipping was set on fire, with those attempting to flee the inferno were massacred by the crowd of Catholics outside. Around 30 Protestants were killed, their bodies thrown into a pyre.\nSimilarly, in Carcassonne there was a massacre of Protestants in December.\n\n\n==== Comtat Venaissin ====\nA Protestant prayer meeting at Villeneuve lès Avignon was stormed by Papal soldiers in 1561. They murdered seven of the attendees, parading the liver of one of their victims on an iron rod.\nOn 19 October, the Pope dispatched his nephew, Fabrizzio di Serbelloni to Avignon for the purpose of defending the Papal territory against Protestant attacks. To this end he was instructed to get into contact with the cardinal de Tournon or even Felipe II if necessary.\nSerbelloni began raising troops in Avignon to 'guard his estates from the Protestants'. Rumour reached the French court that his plans would involve Spanish troops. Therefore, the king had Serbelloni watched and meanwhile ordered troops raised in Marseille, with the city reinforced. The seigneur de Saint-Sulpice and the principe di Salerno (prince of Salerno) were entrusted with investigating Avignon. Saint-Sulpice noted Catherine's disapproval at the mustering of troops without her being informed of their purpose. Salerno wrote to Charles that his subjects were being recruited by Serbelloni and that the Papal commander had failed to punish the perpetrators of the killings of French Protestants at Villeneuve-lès-Avignon. He was also reinforcing Avignon. In light of the above Salerno counselled the king get Serbelloni removed.\nAfter this, Joyeuse was put on notice of a potential Spanish threat, and the cardinal di Ferrara instructed to warn Serbelloni of the king's resolve to bring troops to bear against him if he kept recruiting troops inside France. Joyeuse informed the king there were no Spanish moves on the frontier. Charles wrote directly to Serbelloni informing him that if he needed troops for his protection, he was to use royal troops, the Papal commander was then obliquely threatened.\n\n\n==== Dauphiné and Lyonnais ====\nThe provincial Protestant synods of Dauphiné and the Lyonnais argued that Protestant military organisation should be conducted separately to that of the local consistories. This was a response to developments already underway in the provinces. By this means the consistory could focus on purely religious affairs.\nOn Corpus Christi day in Lyon the Catholic priest who was carrying the host was attacked by a Protestant.\n\n\n==== Provence ====\n\nThe seigneur de Mauvans returned to his campaigns in Provence during 1561. It was with his force that iconoclasm became a systematic process. Catholic peasants of the region therefore took up arms to defend against his attacks. They did not limit themselves to this however and also directed their defence against actions by Catholic lords.\nThere were disorders in Aix-en-Provence, that Catherine and the king felt the governor the comte de Tende was too mild in his repression of. They wrote to him urging him to crush the authors of the disorder and humiliated him for his failures to have properly maintained order. While Tende stalled in his repression, a Catholic vigilante organisation took the lead in crushing Protestantism in Provence. This aristocratic movement was known as the 'Flassans' after its leader the seigneur de Flassans, the governor of Aix. Flassans led forces that called themselves chevaliers de la foi (knights of the faith). His men stalked the province with white wool crosses on their hats led by a Cordelier brandishing a crucifix. This Catholic vigilante force was largely composed of nobles who had been demobilised by the end of the Italian Wars.\nAt the instigation of the Flassans, gibbets were raised in Manosque, Valensole and Marseille. The terror he engaged in was equal to that of Mauvans, and peasants learned to fear both groups. It was reported to the crown despairingly in December that Flassan's armed men had interrupted the provincial estates of Provence. The Catholic rebels considered the possibility of joining up with the Papal commander Fabrizzio di Serbelloni.\n\n\n=== Responses ===\n\n\n==== Catholic Leagues ====\nIn several cities, leagues were founded with the purpose of bringing about the extermination of Protestantism. In the Agenais, in response to complaints that the local Protestants were terrorising the priests and people a noble Catholic league was created in October. The goal of the league was both to protect Catholicism, and to act as a network to better be able to respond to new Protestant 'seditions'. Heading the league was the lieutenant-general of Guyenne, the seigneur de Burie, who had written to Navarre to express his distress at the death of Fumel; also involved was the the seigneur de Nègrepelisse and a host of nobles from Quercy, Armagnac, Rouergue, Comminges, Périgord, alongside those of the Agenais. As soon as this league had tracked down some of the perpetrators of Fumel's killing, Burie disassociated himself from the body. A similar league was established in Dieppe in April with the goal of exterminating Protestants. A lawyer of Bordeaux established a league which boasted 3,000 armed members that were divided across the city to protect the Catholic faith. The league of Bordeaux was a reaction to the 'softness' of Navarre and Burie to Protestantism.\n\n\n==== Subordinate-governors ====\nIn the south of the kingdom, provincial governors were authorised to establish new governors subordinate to themselves to combat the various disorders. These new subordinate governors would have responsibility for seizing arms and suppressing rebellion. By 1572, the diocese of Castres alone (one of the twenty two dioceses of Languedoc) would be home to 24 governors.\n\n\n=== Crussol's mission ===\n\nOn 10 December the king wrote to the comte de Crussol to charge him with overseeing the restoration of order in the Midi. For this purpose he was to have five gendarme companies and several hundred arquebusiers. He was appointed by Catherine as lieutenant and commander in Languedoc. He was tasked by the crown with ensuring the Catholics and Protestants of Languedoc, Dauphiné and Provence enjoyed a state of 'good friendship'. This was difficult, given the aggression with which the communities were fighting in the south at this time. Some Catholics saw his appointment as a clear win for the Protestants of their provinces. In each province he was to collaborate with the lieutenant-general (Languedoc, Guyenne, Dauphiné) or governor (Provence) of the province to see to the maintenance of the kings edicts and the punishment of those who contravened them. In Dauphiné he was to see that those bearing weapons were disarmed and employ good caution. Concerning Languedoc the king warned Crussol that it was possible the perpetrators of scandals in the province might be so powerful that Joyeuse was unable to bring them to justice. With soldiers at his back, Crussol was to destroy those who impeded his commission and gain entry to towns by force if necessary. All officials were to obey Crussol as were he the king. Crussol would be working alongside commissioners to achieve his aims in each province.\nCommissions of two parlementaires were established for each of the provinces in question. Sent out before the publishing of the Edict of Saint-Germain, the commissioners had the advantage of being present on the ground to immediately work towards its implementation. They would have the power to investigate and judge various offences, release prisoners and examine the conduct of the existing judicial apparatus.\n\n\n==== Comtat Venaissin ====\nCrussol's first task was to respond to the threat Serbelloni was making in the Papal territores. Charles and Catherine wrote to the Papal commander that he was to expect Crussol's arrival, and receive him as he would the king.\nCrussol would meet with Serbelloni however the outcome of the meeting is unknown.\n\n\n==== Lyonnais and Dauphiné ====\nArriving in Lyon around the end of December, Crussol ordered the Protestants confine their preaching to outside the cities walls and had the people disarmed. From Lyon he moved to Valence where he treated with the governor La Place to get the Protestants to worship outside the walls and contain their passions, though he was to see that they were protected. Dauphinois Protestants from Romans requested he offer them support against the lieutenant-general of Dauphiné.\nOn 10 January Crussol arrived at Villeneuve-lès-Avignon, establishing the town as his base of operations. From here he summoned several Nîmois Protestants to answer to the charges that they had seized churches. They protested to him that there had been no killing or sedition with their seizures, and they appealed to the royal council. Crussol chided them and ordered they abandon the churches and return the Catholic assets they had acquired. Several days later on 13 January he issued an ordonnance in which he described himself as a lieutenant-general and outlined the instructions he had been provided in his commission. The destruction of Catholic property and attacking of churches were deplored alongside the 'murders and seditions'.\n\n\n==== Languedoc ====\nThe commissioners despatched to Languedoc were Michel Quelain and Jean de La Guesle., they told the king that they found a province in chaos. In Languedoc, the pleas for royal intervention largely came from the Catholics. As in Provence, Crussol held responsibilities for ensuring the enforcement of religious peace in Languedoc. However, he was not present in the province himself so the commissioners looked to the lieutenant general Joyeuse to assist them. The Protestants of the region looked to the commissioners to preserve their assumed right to worship in Nîmes and Montpellier.\nCrussol would exert himself over the eastern parts of the province of Languedoc that were near his estates. In these regions Protestantism had even penetrated the rural communities.\nThe Protestants of Nîmes decided to obey Crussol and return the churches in their possession. The bishop and priests were able to return, celebrating mass on 18 January. However, angry Protestant crowds resented the surrendering of churches back to the Catholics and prevented the conduct of worship in two parish churches. Crussol ordered the arrest of several Catholics of Nîmes also.\nIn Montpellier Crussol also desired to see the return of churches to the Catholics and sent requests to this effect. On 22 January the keys were handed back to the Catholics. These measures led to the throwing of stones when it was attempted to re-introduce mass into the city.\nCrussol noted with approval to Catherine that the subduing of Nîmes and Montpellier was not as challenging as he had feared it might be. Meanwhile, the Protestant pastor Viret urged his flock to obey Crussol in abandoning the churches they had seized and rejecting weapons. He extolled them to follow the terms of the edict of Saint-Germain or be subject to force of arms from the comte de Crussol. Crussol moved on from Languedoc to Provence, leaving Languedoc in the hands of Quelain and La Guesle.\nBy May 1562, with Crussol having been recalled to court, the lieutenant-general of Languedoc wrote to Catherine, summarising the endless seditions that dominated the province, before noting that \"Crussol will say to you in what state he is leaving affairs\".\n\n\n==== Provence ====\nAntoine Fumée and André de Ponnat were the two parlementaires charged with restoring order in Provence. Though despatched in November, they would not assume their responsibilities prior to early February, around when the parlement of Aix was considering the Edict of Saint-Germain. They were to collaborate with local judicial authorities unless the local judiciary proved compromised against their mission. To assist them in the establishment of order they were expected to collaborate with the governor of Provence the comte de Tende, and the comte de Crussol who had been established as lieutenant-general for the pacification of Provence. Crussol's appointment to this charge had earned rebuke from the parlement on account of suspicions of his Protestant leanings.\nThe commissioners faced off against the sieur de Flassans who led the extreme anti-Protestants of Provence in a reign of terror. The commissioners summoned Flassans to meet with them, but he declined, and likewise refused to disarm. Crussol (who had entered Provence at the end of January), wrote to Catherine asking her to send letters to Flassans and the leader of the parlement of Aix instructing them to leave Provence.\nFlassans defiantly announced that the Edict of January only applied to regions that had asked for it like Paris and Orléans. As a result, he was declared a rebel and subjected to a military campaign.\nInitially denied entry to Aix, the commissioners set themselves up at Marignane and established an assembly, inviting all parties to present and explain themselves. The authorities of Aix complied with the exception of Flassans. They tried to justify their obstructionism, but were dismissed. After the capitulation of the clergy on 5 February, the commissioners moved into Aix and spoke before the parlement. Crussol and the comte de Tende also entered Aix at this time. The Protestants were given a site for their worship, the populace was disarmed and the edict of Saint-Germain forced through the parlement. Officers of the crown aligned with Flassans including those in the parlement were purged by the crown. It was their goal, they said, to deal with seditions. The parlement responded positively, and aided them in the purge of the consulate. Having published the prior edicts of the crown and got to work ensuring they were observed. Crussol was increasingly apprehensive about the success of his mission, and requested more troops from the crown. In a meeting with the local commander, they declared that it was the king's wish that Protestants and Catholics live with one another in harmony. Fumée and Ponnat were pleased to report in March that Aix was now at peace.\nAt a distance from Marseille the commissioners feared their ability to enforce justice there would be hampered.\n\n\n==== Guyenne ====\nThe commissioners despatched to Guyenne were Nicolas de Compaing and Guillaume Girard. De Bèze implored the Protestants of Guyenne to abandon their support of seditions and work with the two commissioners. It was expected that Crussol and the commander Blaise de Monluc would enforce the judgements of the commissioners. Despite the lieutenant-general of Guyenne, the seigneur de Burie, greatly desiring the commissioners presence, they were delayed in their arrival until the end of February. Therefore, in their absence several parlementaires from Bordeaux were deputised to fill in for them. These two would also be delayed, and in the end Monluc and Burie found themselves dissatisfied with both sets of commissioners. Those of Bordeaux were inexperienced and had remits too limited for the needs of the situation. Those of the crown were 'so favourable towards the Protestants that Monluc and Burie were subject to many complaints'. Monluc would claim in his memoires that they were some of the most extreme Protestants in the kingdom. They therefore requested the crown send new commissioners. The parlement meanwhile attempted to get their commissioners adopted by the crown, arguing that it was the easiest alternative to bringing in outsiders, and had worked well for prior kings.\nIn Monluc's estimation the royally appointed men had set to work prosecuting 'innocent' Catholics in Cahors, which he felt was deliberate revenge for his prosecution of the perpetrators of the Fumel killing. Girard and Compaing were in fact beginning with the prosecution of those responsible for a massacre of Protestants in Cahors. When Burie and Monluc decided to move over to the Agenais they requested the commissioners come with them, but the commissioners rebuffed them. Therefore, Burie and Monluc turned to alternative commissioners.\nAt Moissac, Compaing and Girard intervened against an unauthorised gathering of nobles in the town, they requested a list of names of those who had gathered at Moissac. This earned them the enmity of the nobles who complained to Monluc and Burie.\nCompaing and Girard would disagree with Monluc and Burie most seriously over the matter of the Edict of Saint-Germain. The former argued the latter had misinterpreted the edict by seeking to prohibit the presence of Protestant ministers in places they had not operated previously. The two commissioners asked the crown to write a clarification to them endorsing their understanding that this interpretation simply punished those who had been law abiding in prior times. The cardinal d'Armagnac also protested against the commissioners, arguing that for a minister to be established in a community the permission of the relevant seigneur, priest and church warden was required. Armagnac was misinterpreting the edict, this was only a requirement for travelling ministers. The complaints from all the grandees led to the removal of Compaing and Girard.\nComplaints arose from Bordeaux of provocative militant demonstrations by the cities Protestants. Burie leant his support to the Protestant community of the city, agreeing with them that the city had unfairly been blocking their rights to bury their dead as they desired.\nCatherine considered a further means by which to see to the reconciliation of the religions in the Midi. This was to be through the dispatch of Condé to the Midi so that he might oversee disarmament, the return of property and bring about an end looting. He would also offer benefits to his co-religionists through the identification of sites outside cities for Protestant worship. This plan which found strong objections from Felipe II, was never implemented.\n\n\n=== Reconciliation ===\nAfter 12 July, Guise again departed court, and spends time in Picardie, before travelling to Calais in August for the departure of Marie Stuart to Scotland. She left accompanied by Aumale, Elbeuf, the grand prieur and Montmorency's son Damville on 15 August. Established in Scotland she understood from the example of the reign of François II that repression was no longer an effective religious policy. When approached by Scottish Catholics she rebuffed them, though she would not adopt Protestantism. Determined to play a part in the royal project of the Autumn, Guise returns to court on 23 August joining with his brother who had arrived on 29 July.\nLorraine enjoyed a productive interview with the English ambassador after his return to court at the end of July, keen to rebuild bridges with the English crown now the families fortunes in Scotland were on the rise again. The two discussed church reform, and when Lorraine became aware of a Catholic pamphlet from Lyon which decried Elizabeth as a 'Jezebel', he made efforts to get its author arrested. Seeing Lorraine as sympathetic to Lutheranism, the ambassador made quick appeals to get a translated copy of the English Prayer Book for him.\nA reconciliation was staged between Condé and Guise on 24 August in the residence of Montmorency - who was sick. Guise announced to Condé that he had played no role in his imprisonment, Condé replied that he considered the instigators of his imprisonment to be wicked, to which Guise agreed, again stating that it did not effect him. It was observed on an outward level. The 'farcical' reconciliation was largely necessary so as to facilitate the possibility of the upcoming Colloquy going ahead. Without it, the two men would not be present at court together at the same time. For Guise he could not hope to remain part of the government if he ignored the parlements judgement of Condé's innocence, further it allowed him to continue to build his reputation for magnanimity. Guise and Montmorency visited Catherine on 28 August at midnight to darkly observe that they understood Catholics of the kingdom to be arming, and that there was a risk of the kingdom being split in two.\nThe reconciliation between Condé and Guise was achieved just before the arrival of the queen of Navarre at court. In the estimation of the Venetian ambassador this was fortuitous as he believed she would surely have sabotaged the efforts. Relations had greatly deteriorated between the queen and her husband since her conversion. Not only did the king of Navarre make fun of her religion at court, but he had also taken to seeing another woman during her absence. The queen had written angrily to the cardinal d'Armagnac accusing him of being the cause of her husband's fall into error. She brought with her to court her children the prince de Béarn and Catherine. The queen mother greeted her warmly and lodged her in the finest apartments of Saint-Germain for the upcoming Colloquy.\n\n\n=== Colloquy of Poissy ===\n\nLetters calling for the convocation of a Colloquy, with Protestants invited, were issued on 25 July. At this time, Catherine enjoyed greater relations with her Protestant advisers than the Catholic ones. According to the cardinal di Ferrara, Catherine complained that those Catholics around her showed a lack of gratitude, while the Protestants were very deferential.\nIn August a dialogue was scheduled to take pace between Protestants and Catholic prelates. Only five of the invited Catholic prelates objected to the Protestants getting a chance to say their piece. Nevertheless, around half of the French bishops assembled at Poissy would not attend the colloquy. At the suggestion of the bishop of Valence an invitation was sent to Genève to send Protestant representatives for the discussions. Coligny requested of de Bèze that he participate, and he agreed. De Bèze therefore travelled into France to represent the Protestant party.  The convening of the colloquy was already seen as a success by the Protestants, a chance to expound their religious views, the 'intrinsic validity of which would naturally bring about the conversion of those present'. In an initial meeting between de Bėze and Lorraine the two had a positive interaction in which they found much agreement on matters of religion between their two positions. Lorraine opened the meeting by announcing that he knew de Bèze only through his works, which had caused much disorder in the kingdom. De Bèze denied that he had written 'Le Tigre' and told Lorraine he accorded him too much influence. Lorraine then asked whether de Bèze had written a passage implying Christ was equally present in the eucharist and mud. De Bèze denied this, outlining the Calvinist position to which Lorraine highlighted the Lutheran one. After further questioning Lorraine and de Bèze appeared to reach agreement on the mass and the two men concluded with an embrace, Lorraine noting 'you will find I am not as black as they make me out to be'. The moderate Catholics at the conference were ready to make certain concessions, such as taking communion in both kinds, modifications to the ritual of baptism to increase its simplicity and a reduction in the cult of images. These concessions were the limit for some moderates like Claude d'Espence and the bishop of Valence.  However these concessions did not effect the core issues such as the real presence, which would prove far more difficult. Navarre, Catherine and L'Hôpital looked to the Protestant Confession of Augsburg as a key stepping stone to the establishment of religious unity in the kingdom.\nSaint-André, who vociferously opposed the convocation of the colloquy had to depart court in early September.\nOn 9 September the colloquy proper opened, in attendance the royal family, the princes du sang, the councillors of the king, forty archbishops and bishops, twelve theologians and other canon lawyers. For the Protestant party, there were twelve theologians, chief among them de Bèze. L'Hôpital opened proceedings, reminding the Catholic prelates present that they could treat with the Protestants, who were not Arian or Manichaean and abided by the four major councils, the scripture and the apostolic creed. The Protestant preachers were then ushered in, under the protection of Guise's guard, to begin proceedings. De Bèze got off to a promising start for the prospect of compromise, striking an ecumenical tone and avoiding complex matters of doctrine. He aroused furore however when during his address he turned to the matter of transubstation. He remarked that while Christ was present during the transubstantiation, the body of Christ was as far from the bread and wine of Mass as the heavens were from the earth. The Catholic prelates present erupted in outrage, with the most firm among them the cardinal de Tournon exploding in a cry of 'blasphemy' before he turned and remarked to Catherine how she could possibly allow such horrible things to be said in front of the young king and her other children. His remarks reflected a general concern among the more rigidly Catholic nobility that Catherine was leading the royal family towards Protestantism. With difficulty de Bèze concluded his speech. Tournon asked that his speech be printed so that the Catholics could prepare their response which was to be given on 16 September. In the reply Lorraine defended the Catholic conception of the eucharist from the Protestant attacks, he argued that even the Orthodox church and Lutherans supported the Catholic position on this matter. De Bèze reacted scornfully to Lorraine's defence noting that Lorraine was speaking 'the old arguments, a thousand times refuted'. He also reacted with hostility to the proposals of Navarre that they invite the Lutherans to join the colloquy. Coligny confided despondently to Vermigli of his disappointment in the colloquy, informing the Florentine Protestant of his frustration that Catherine did not always listen to his proposals for the conduct of the sessions. During the session on 24 September, Lorraine presented the Württemberg confession to de Bèze (a similar confession to that of Augsburg) and asked him to sign it. De Bèze rejoindered by asking him to sign it first, something which earned Lorraine suspicious looks from the more conservative prelates. The general of the Jesuits Laynez had by now arrived, and was keen to ensure that the talks went no further. He announced that anyone who continued this 'Colloquy' with the Protestants would be excommunicated. He then informed Catherine that the Protestants were 'foxes, wolves and murderers' and that the only council that could look into matters of doctrine was the Council of Trent, not a national council. Tournon himself further sabotaged the continuity of the talks by insisting de Bèze subscribe to the points established so far by Lorraine, something that de Bèze could not agree to. After this debacle, and with Laynez present, Catherine decided to limit the attendees of future sessions to solely the delegates concerned with the discussions (twelve for each side), however it became clear in the acrimonious discussions that followed that no compromise could be reached that would unite the two creeds. A final attempt to save the conference with five representatives of each side meeting to discuss the eucharist also failed to close the divide. After a month the Colloquy ended on 18 October without any achievement. The Lutherans who had been invited to join the talks by Guise and Lorraine had not yet even arrived.\nDuring the Colloquy, it was again reported to the Pope that cardinal de Châtillon had taken the eucharist in the Protestant manner with several other prelates (the bishop of Valence and the bishop of Uzès). These men, though members of the Catholic delegation at the colloquy refused to take communion from cardinal d'Armagnac or swear in favour of the real presence, as was demanded by the assembled clergy at large. They were not alone in refusing to swear the confession of faith, and were joined by the bishop of Chartres. The bishop of Troyes who was also present at the colloquy of Poissy, was the most openly Protestant of the prelates.\nThe failure of the colloquy damaged the credit of Lorraine with Catherine as she began to doubt his abilities. Having left the discussions before their conclusion, he resigned his office as chancellor of the ordre de Saint-Michel on 29 September. Tensions also grew inside the Lorraine family with the ultra-Catholic wing of the family desiring to end this period of compromise Lorraine was following. For Guise the colloquy was an unbearable experience as it afforded an opportunity for the presence of so many 'seditious heretics' at the court and Poissy. The duc observed that the colloquy did not quell the passions of the Protestants, who according to the letter he had from the vicomte de Joyeuse were in the process of seizing towns in Languedoc and suppressing the mass.\nOn 24 October Catherine appealed to the Pope for religious concessions, including an allowance for the laity to take communion in both kinds. These demands were poorly received by the Papacy. Meanwhile, domestically, the king issued a request to the bishops of the kingdom that for advent they chose moderate preachers who would not induce disorders through intolerant sermons.\nBy this time, Navarre was being courted by the Spanish, who offered him the kingdom of Sardinia in return for him pushing for the outlawing of Protestantism in France. In August he despatched his confident the rigidly Catholic comte d'Escars to Roma. Escars received the blessing of the Curia for Navarre's dealings with Felipe. At this time d'Escars also became the lieutenant-general of the Limousin, appointed by the king in the hope he could revitalise connections between the crown and the nobility.  While residing in Paris for a week in December, Navarre attended mass every day. His definitive break with Protestantism led to his denouncement by de Bèze as a new Julian the Apostate.\nCatherine and the Protestants of the court plead with de Bèze to remain at court, while Calvin and the city government of Genève requested his return. Condé and the queen of Navarre appealed to Genève to grant him three months of leave. Not particularly interested in religion, Catherine saw de Bèze's importance in his ability to regulate and discipline the increasingly large Protestant community. At court de Bèze united the Crussol, Condé, Châtillon, and Albret families into a single church. The Protestants of court would consent to the issuing of a declaration on 21 October calling for the restoration of all Protestant seized churches to their original owner. Coligny and d'Andelot took up the royal declaration and advocated for it themselves. In return for this concession, de Bèze and Coligny were promised that they would be granted a place of assembly for every city, on condition the assembly did not exceed 500 in number. Nicoll argues that this was part of the same plan as that which ordered for the return of the Catholic churches. Lettres de cachet were issued to this effect on 3 November, while Catherine explored a more formal version of legal Protestantism. De Bèze expressed considerably concern that the impatience of his co-religionists would 'snatch this victory from them'.\n\n\n=== Kidnap plot ===\n\nGuise and his wife the duchesse de Guise, increasingly fearful of a Protestant coup, advised Catherine to send her younger children away from court. The duchesse proposed sending the duc d'Orléans (the future king Henri III) to be with his sister the duchesse de Lorraine and the duc d'Évreux (Catherine's third surviving son, future duc d'Alençon) to his aunt in Savoia, the duchessa di Savoia. These urgings were built upon by the Spanish ambassador Chantonnay.\nDuring October, a plot was uncovered by which the duc de Nemours attempted to kidnap the king's brother Orléans from the court, and take him to Lorraine or Savoie. From here he could take the head of a Catholic party. Nemours propositioned the young prince to this effect. After Nemours had convinced Orléans it was the turn of Orléans' friend the young prince de Joinville, son of the duc de Guise, who excitedly informed Orléans of how happy they would be in Lorraine. He explained the method by which he would be spirited from the court. The young Orléans confided the plot in a servant who promptly informed the queen. Upon discovering this plot Catherine was horrified and quickly moved to establish an official version in which Orléans had come to her after first hearing the seditious plot to confide it in her. In response to this attempted coup, the guard was doubled around the royal apartments and it is possible Orléans' windows were even bricked up.\nOn 9 October, Aumale departed court, he would be the first of a flood of Lorraine princes and allies to leave, closely followed by Lorraine and the bishop of Évreux. On 19 October, the duc de Guise, and all their other brothers along with the the duc de Longueville, the duc de Nemours and 700 horsemen who composed their clientele departed from court in grand fashion, they were in turn followed two days later the constable de Montmorency who joined the exodus. The presence of Longueville, whose engagement with Guise's daughter had been broken off earlier that year, suggests to Carroll that Guise still supported Lorraine's policy. Alongside his disapproval at religious developments, Montmorency was angry at the rumours that Condé might usurp the office of constable from him. This was the first time all the Lorraine brothers had departed court at once. Their departure was a conscious expression of their disapproval of the crowns policy, and in Carroll's estimation despite losing access to the levers of political power, those who departed actually increased their informal power. By leaving the court, on the one hand they freed the crown to pursue toleration, but on the other they isolated the court and indicated to Catholics (both domestic and international - Felipe II of España) that they supported the radicals in their disapproval of the policy.  Guise retired to his lands in Champagne, and would spend the next several months there, Lorraine meanwhile went to his archbishopric of Reims. The absence of the grandees from court also raised the ominous spectre that they could take up arms, so that they could pressure the crown to abandon its policy of toleration. Only Tournon remained at court to defend the anti-toleration cause.\nCatherine dispatched the comte de Crussol to inquire of Guise and Lorraine as to their involvement in the kidnap plot near the end of October. They denied being involved and suggested it was a Protestant libel. Crussol discussed Nemours plan with them being careful to avoid directly mention any details which might implicate the Lorraine family. They assured him that if Nemours was truly guilty he would have no greater enemy than them. Durot believes that while they may not have planned to kidnap the prince, it was advantageous to them to instil the desire in Orléans to flee the court, as a lever which could be used to pressure Catherine. On 29 October Orléans appeared before the king and testified to the nature of the conspiracy. He left out the involvement of the young prince de Joinville, focusing instead on Nemours, possibly at his mother's request. Catherine asked him why he had thought of leaving her, to which Orléans begged for her forgiveness, but stated he had never desired to leave her.\nNemours had by now secured himself in Savoie, despite Catherine's desire to see him brought to her dead or alive. He dispatched the sieur de Lignerolles to deny the charges against him. Lignerolles was thus arrested on 20 November. Lignerolles argued Nemours' words to Orléans had been little more than wishful thinking given the troubles in France, and that the proposed 'escape' was nonsensical. Catherine realised all she had against Nemours was the word of a ten year old and pursuit of the case was dropped. In January Lignerolles was released, and Nemours was cleared of the charge in May 1562. The secrétaire d'État Alluye wrote to encourage his return, informing him that his absence was regretted by the court. On 9 June 1562, Nemours was allowed to return to court, though Catherine would hold a grudge against the prince.\nCatherine undertook appeals for Guise to return to court, which he politely declined in November, after which Catherine turned to working on his wife Anne. Guise took up correspondence with Montmorency and his wife, informing them that they should take great pride in their daughter Louise de Montmorency, who was a nun at the convent of Saint-Pierre de Reims. He also entered correspondence with several of the German Lutheran princes. The herzog von Württemberg (duke of Württemberg) corresponded with Guise, Navarre and also acted as an intermediary between the French Protestants and crown.\n\n\n=== Loss of momentum ===\nThe apogee of the Protestants had passed, and by December, both Condé and Coligny had departed court. This was not to say they had given up on government, and both continued to influence Catherine. Condé let it be known that he was travelling to Amiens to enforce the crown's orders against religious violence. Despite his Protestantism he urged them to also expel Protestant refugees. In early December, Montmorency and Saint-André returned to court. With Navarre now moving towards the Catholic camp, Catherine began to fear an intrigue to usurp her regency was in progress.\nSome Catholic notables in Picardie were now greatly in opposition to Condé and wrote to Navarre and Montmorency asking them to protect the Catholic religion. Condé discovered this and wrote sharply to express his disapproval. He would not make it to Picardie before the start of the war.\nThe duc de Bouillon's proximity to Guise meant that despite his Protestantism, the prospect of relieving him of his governate of Normandie was considered, though not executed, in November. Without his traditional patron of Diane de Poitiers, Bouillon was reliant in this period on Guise's support to maintain him in the office.\nIn December the comte de Crussol was granted the honour of inducting the baron de Gordes and the comte de Sault into the ordre de Saint-Michel. Burie received a similar commission to induct the sieur de Soubise he noted in correspondence to the crown there might be complications in this process due to Soubise's Protestant inclinations.\n\n\n==== Saint-Médard ====\nOn 26 December 1561 the religious tensions between Protestant and Catholics in Paris exploded in the Saint-Médard riot involving Protestants who had gathered with the intent of worshipping in a residence near the church of Saint-Médard. The Protestants had expressed their annoyance at the sounds of bell ringing for Catholic service, while the Catholics complained of the Protestant psalm singing. The former group, sent one of their number to complain to the Catholics, who did not immediately accede to the complaint and cease the bell ringing. More Protestant representatives were sent and a fight somehow began during which one of the Protestants was killed. In retribution for this Protestant rioters invaded the church attacking the worshippers inside. The church was attacked to purge it of idolatrous objects during its looting. The Catholic rioters would be ambushed by the royal authorities, and would spend the night in the prison of the petit-châtelet, among the arrested were priests. They were released after six days. No Protestants were arrested in the aftermath of the riot by contrast. In the popular imagination the incident was seen as a Protestant show of their power and control over the city. Even those Catholics inclined towards softer opinions on Protestantism were outraged. \nThe lieutenant-criminel Desjardins who had undertaken the arrests was himself arrested. An investigation by the parlement of Paris in 1562 sentenced the chevalier du guet (knight of the watch) and their assistant to be hanged for their role in arresting the Catholic clergy. Desjardins by contrast avoided their fate through the protection of Catherine, and exhausted the parlement with a cascade of récusations against the various parlementaires involved in his trial.\nAt the beginning of 1562, with (largely unfounded) fears rising that a foreign intervention might soon be undertaken to force the crown to resume persecution, Coligny reached out to the Protestant churches of France, asking them to take stock of the military forces they could field if necessary. Indeed, Catherine had requested an estimation of the strength of the Protestant church in the final days of 1561, so that she might understand the support they could give to the crown. Coligny returned with a figure of 2,150 churches. The consistory of Le Mans promised that they would serve in war for the crown against any prince who tried to wage war against the king. By this request of Catherine, the Protestants of the kingdom came to see themselves more as the defenders of the crown, and more justified in military action if the government began to move towards the Catholic camp.\nCatherine ignored the protests of the Spanish ambassador Chantonnay who accused Coligny of preparing an expedition of ships hostile to Spanish colonial holdings. It was alleged that Coligny sought to establish a Protestant colony inside territories claimed by España. Chantonnay set his king up in opposition to the Coligny brothers, telling Catherine she must choose one or the other. To this she demurred. Since 1561 Felipe had been angling for the dismissal of Coligny, Condé and the other Protestants from the French court.\n\n\n=== The Spanish threat ===\n\nEnvoys from the papal curia attempted to convince Felipe II of the wisdom of an intervention in France during October to 'deliver the kingdom from its calamities'. While the appeal was not made directly in the Pope's name, it was intimated that he was aware of and approved the enterprise. The king was urged to send his gendarmerie across the border from both the north and south. Emboldened by these actions, Felipe's tone became increasingly stern, implying that if the French crown became Protestant he would declare war. On 17 October, Chantonnay, the Spanish ambassador conveyed that his king would offer troops to aid Catherine against the 'rebels', and if she refused, that they would be at the disposal of the Catholics of France. Catherine, furious, demanded an explanation from Madrid. The increasingly belligerent attitude of España towards France sparked the fear of the crown. Therefore, several steps were taken for the protection of France. The lieutenant-general of Languedoc, Joyeuse was warned to be prepared in case any enterprises were undertaken across the border. Calais and Metz both received reinforcements. The governor of the latter Vielleville was ordered not to permit the entry of Guise or his allies into the city, lest they hand it over to Felipe.  The governor of Calais, the seigneur de Gourdan was relieved of his charge in favour of the sieur de Gramont.\n\n\n==== Pacification of the south-west ====\nIn response to the disorders that had consumed the south-west of France through the Autumn and Winter of 1561, and the relative timidity of the lieutenant-general of Guyenne (the seigneur de Burie) in confronting them, Monluc was given a commission to restore order through violent means. During February the sieur de Rouillac was besieged in his residence at Saint-Mézard after he had attempted to stop damage to the churches on his land. Monluc began his work at Saint-Mézard where on 20 February, he had a Protestant beheaded for the crime of insulting the king. Some peasants were hanged, and a deacon whipped. He replicated this brutal policy in Fumel, Villefranche-de-Rouergue and Monségur. He explained to the crown that it was only by harshness that pacification could come to pass, leniency would only bring further seditions.\n\n\n== Toleration ==\nAround 3 January 1562 L'Hôpital first spoke in favour of an (at least temporary) toleration of a diversity of religion in the kingdom. He subordinated the matter of religion to the stability of the republic, going so far as to declare that someone who was not a Christian could be a citizen of the kingdom. Turchetti identifies this moment with the fracturing of the 'middle party' into those who could subordinate religious matters to civic ones on a temporary or permanent basis and tolerate the diversity of religion; and those of the more traditional moyenneur party who wished to find a confessional compromise by which the church could be reunited.\n\n\n=== Edict of Saint-Germain ===\n\nCatherine decided a new edict was needed to resolve the religious disorders. To this end she had the principal magistrates of the parlements and members of the royal council assemble at Saint-Germain to deliberate on the best means of pacifying the kingdom. Orders were sent out to this effect at the end of October. Those chevaliers de l'Ordre de Saint-Michel who were present in Paris were also invited to participate. This endeavour had the support of Navarre, Condé, Coligny and one of the sons of Montmorency. The delegates were carefully selected by Catherine for their largely moderate dispositions, so that they might come to the agreement that she hoped. This was to avoid a repeat of the talks that had preceded the edict of July. Therefore, the parlementaire présidents Christophe de Harley and René Baillet and conseillers Paul de Foix and Arnaud de Ferrier of the moderate faction of the Paris parlement participated. Grandees would also participate, among them Saint-André, marshal Montmorency and the cardinal de Tournon. Tournon estimated that there were '12 good Catholics' among those present for the discussions. Chancellor L'Hôpital led the discussions. He announced that repression had failed, but that they had not been called together by the king to determine whether Protestantism or Catholicism was the superior creed, but to sooth the troubles. For L'Hôpital unity of faith in the kingdom remained the ideal, but this had to be subordinated to the political needs of the moment. Debate followed from 7 to 15 January, and was bitterly argued by those present. Of the 49 assembled grandees, the proposal to grant Protestants churches failed by 29–22, however there was a majority in favour of granting the rights of Protestants to assemble and worship freely. Only 10 of the assembled delegates were opposed to any toleration. At the conclusion of the discussion Catherine re-assured the delegates that she and her children would remain Catholic and in obedience to the Roman church. She further stated that this toleration was only to avoid continued bloodshed and disorder in the kingdom. Religious affairs would be properly solved at such time as a full church council could be held. Her speech was hailed by the Papal Nuncio who was present.\nAs a result of these discussions the Edict of Saint-Germain, or Edict of January  was issued on 17 January, by which Protestantism was legalised outside of cities, until such time a General Council of the church could be held. The Protestants were not to meet at night. Pastors of the Protestant church had to swear to abide by the terms of the edict. Synods were prohibited except for in circumstances in which they were officially authorised. Protestants were to return Catholic property they had seized, and were forbidden from making attacks on Catholic worship on pain of death. Protestant sermons could also not denounce Catholic mass. Officers of the crown were to be afforded access to Protestant services whenever they requested it, Protestants could not impose taxation and had to maintain the \"political laws of the Roman church\", by which is meant the administrative aspects of Catholic public life. Though Protestantism was now legally to be 'tolerated' this did not hold the modern connotations of the word, but rather that Protestantism was something that must be suffered and endured to avoid the greater evil of civil disorder. As with the 1560 Edict of Amboise, the fact that it was the beginning of the young king's reign was utilised as justification, as it was stated that Charles did not wish to begin his reign with bloody repression.\nOn 24 January Navarre and marshal Montmorency were dispatched to the parlement of Paris to demand the body begin deliberating the edict. The Marshal and Navarre demanded the edicts immediate registration, however the court was unmoved by this bluff, and instead demanded they be provided copies so they could begin to review the edict. That same day, a delegation from the Sorbonne, the chancelier of the church of Paris, and the men of the hôtel de ville came to implore the parlement not to register the edict. The parlement had 1,200 copies of the edict that had been printed by marshal Montmorency at Catherine's request seized on 27 January. The parlement was greatly annoyed the edict had been printed and distributed before the body had looked it over. On 30 January the sieur de Thieux was dispatched to hurry the parlement causing the body to react with irritation. The parlement refused to register the edict and remonstrated with the crown on 12 February, coming to Saint-Germain. They highlighted that when coronated, the king had sworn to banish heresy from the kingdom, and that no religiously divided kingdom could survive. Far from restoring order in the kingdom, it would be condemned to chaotic seditions by the edict. The parlement implied the edict was possibly illegal, due to the minority of the king and Catherine being a woman. The parlementaires were dressed down when they presented their remonstrance, L'Hôpital argued it proved they did not understand the situation like the queen and her council did. Catherine further retorted to the parlementaires that there were so many abuses in the church, that it was natural to desire its reformation. She further informed them that she above all others despised the harsh methods of the past. By this edict things could be calmed until a council could resolve the religious question. De Thou returned to the parlement with an assurance that the king would remain in the Catholic faith, and that Protestant services would be open to officers of the law to ensure they were not seditious. It was affirmed that officers of justice would be expected to remain Catholic and that their involvement with Protestant services was not to participate but to ensure they remained non seditious. This satisfied him that the edict could be registered. He brought along with him in his backing of the edict the moderate wing of the parlement.\nUnrest grew in Paris as a result of the delay in registering the edict, with a band of around 400 armed Protestant students walking the streets to the courthouse. Letters patent were issued on 14 February to compel the parlement to register the edict in which the king stated he never intended to approve of two religions in the kingdom and the edict was a provisional measure. As such tolerance was a civic matter not a religious one. Nevertheless, on 18 February, the body again rejected the edict. On 3 March La Roche-sur-Yon was sent to apply further pressure on the body, and he succeeded in overcoming their objections, highlighting that Charles would remain Catholic and the alternative was disorder. La Roche-sur-Yon pointed to the various disorders in the capital, and the rumours of armed groups approaching the city. Marshal de Montmorency confirmed the princes report, informing the court that there were around 5–6,000 armed men approaching the capital. While the final deliberations were taking place, a large band of students rioted in the courtyard of the Palais de Justice itself shouting that if they were not given temples they would seize them. On 5 March the Parlement relented and registered the edict. The parlement noted their registration came without 'approval of the new religion' and until such time as a new edict was issued. Their approval was further disavowed in the parlements secret register. No sooner was the edict published than Catherine and the court departed to Montceaux-en-Brie, in Romier's opinion to avoid being subject to the Catholic reaction to the edict. Tournon was tearful as she departed, recommending to her she return to the Catholic religion. This registration came after the Massacre of Wassy had already sabotaged the edict. Meanwhile, the Spanish ambassador Chantonnay offered to lend his support in ridding her of her 'mendacious' Protestant advisers. The Pope advised the king to spare 'neither fire nor iron' in the reunification of the French church.\nTo enforce the edict, around 12 commissioners were despatched by the crown.\n\n\n==== Protestant reaction ====\nThe Protestant reception of the edict was largely positive, though they had little intention of returning the churches they had seized in the Midi to their former Catholic occupants. The edict was after all just a stepping stone on the way to the full conversion of the kingdom to Protestantism, or so de Bèze believed. Venard characterises this as a delusion, highlighting the distance between the king and the Protestants in the edict. De Bèze opined that the edict was written in 'harsh terms' and had some unfair additions the Catholic ultras hoped would induce the Protestants to violent action, but that the Protestants would be content to look to god for the arrangement they desired. The Protestants assembled at Saint-Germain wrote out to the provinces urging them to move quickly to see the edict adhered to, so that the crown could see what obedient subjects they were. It was a relief for many Protestants that their loyalty to god and their loyalty to the king were now no longer to be in conflict with one another.\nIn Paris sermons were held by the terms of the edict in the faubourgs Saint-Antoine, Saint-Marcel and Saint-Jacques.\n\n\n==== New colloquy ====\nFrom 28 January to 11 February Catherine hosted a second colloquy. The topics of discussion were the place of images in religious observances and the rite of baptism. However these talks proved no more fruitful than those of Poissy the year previous. Navarre and the prelates who were present now showed total intransigence towards compromise, looking instead to the council of Trent. It was only on the matter of the cult of the Saints that some Catholic prelates expressed reservations, but even here they would not consent to its abolition. Many of the attendees were the same as those who had attended Poissy: de Bèze, Coligny, Monluc, d'Espence, the abbot of Salignac and Boutellier.\nUntil the end of January, Catherine remained committed to the course of tolerance. Andelot was introduced into the royal council and the queen had Charles' more rigidly Catholic governor replaced with the prince de La Roche-sur-Yon, whose health led to fears that the king would in fact be governed by Coligny.\n\n\n=== Pushback ===\n\n\n==== Catholic ====\nMany Catholics felt betrayed by the policy of their king and his government. The desecration of the articles of their faith by the iconoclasts was something they felt need to be combatted, not tolerated in an official edict. Calvin was the anti-Christ by this reckoning, and these fears were fanned by itinerant preachers who spoke of the calamities that would befall France if heresy was not eradicated. Therefore, there now appeared to be a contradiction between the obedience they owed the king and the obedience they owed god.\nEven moderate Catholics had a difficult time accepting the edict. The edict came as a great blow to the moyenneurs who had looked to Poissy for its possibility of broaching a confessional compromise by which the Protestants and Catholics could be reunited under one roof. Of the Catholic princes, only the prince de La Roche-sur-Yon supported the edict. The crown had failed to find a formula to achieve broader support from the moyenneur faction. To these people it was an abomination that the kingdom was now composed of two diverse creeds which would be opposed to one another. The inevitable result would be conflict between Protestant and Catholic which would undermine the authority of the king. For Lorraine, while he had been keen to see dogmatic reconciliation with the Protestants, the granting of toleration was to be opposed as it marked a failure of the policy of reunification. Moreover, in his estimation, the edict overstepped the bounds of what was proper for the monarchy in regards to the French church. For some moyenneurs the edict was salvaged by the fact it was a temporary provisional measure, and would not lead to the permanent approval of diversity of religion.\nL'Hôpital, by contrast, saw toleration as an act of patience for the errors of others, which could only be rectified by god.\nIn pamphlets Catherine was decried as a new Jezebel, introducing false religion into the realm, while L'Hôpital was suspected of being a crypto-Protestant. While both L'Hôpital's wife and daughter were Protestant, the chancellor himself would remain Catholic throughout his life.\nIn the south, the seigneur de Nègrepelisse at the head of around four thousand gentleman of the Quercy, Périgord, Agenais, Armagnac, Rouergue and Comminges regions approached the sieur de Burie (lieutenant-general of Guyenne) and Monluc to propose that their services be employed against the Protestants.\n\n\n==== Sorbonne ====\nThe Edict of Saint-Germain was the final straw for many of the Catholic princes.  It was also abhorrent to many other Catholics. The Sorbonne and clergy of Paris urged the Parlements to reject registration of the edict. The crown lacked the authority to impose the edict, which was seen by many as a violation of their consciences. Instead of soothing religious discord it would be inflamed.\n\n\n==== Paris ====\nThe city council and clergy of Paris protested against the new edict strongly. A manifesto called for the renouncing of tolerance and the extirpation of heresy. A delegation of Parisian merchants also lodged their own protest with the king at Saint-Germain. Catherine explained to the prévôt des marchands (provost of the merchants) that she had not allowed Protestants to meet in Paris and that they would be outside of the city.\n\n\n==== Dijon ====\nIn Dijon the lieutenant-general of the province, Tavannes, and the mayor and city council were aghast when they learned of the new edict. They, along with the parlement of Dijon, refused to recognise the edict. Further they despatched a delegation to the court of the mayor and several échevins (alderman) to explain that Dijon's situation made it unsuitable for such an edict. The city was a 'frontier fortification' and the permission for assemblies would only bring about seditions. The massacre of Wassy and its aftermath would enable Tavannes and Dijon to continue their efforts to suppress Protestantism in Bourgogne. After six months, the parlement was granted permission to not register the edict.\n\n\n==== Toulouse ====\nThe capitouls of the city of Toulouse informed Catherine that the Catholics of their city would not hesitate to employ violence to oppose toleration. The Protestants soon began the construction of a church outside the walls of the city from a covered barn.\n\n\n==== Bordeaux ====\nIn Bordeaux, the seigneur de Monluc argued that as a frontier town, Bordeaux was exempt by the terms of the edict from having to site Protestant churches outside its walls.\nThe lieutenant-general of Guyenne Burie and premier président of the Bordeaux parlement Lagebâton were meanwhile planning their attack on the Catholic syndicate of the Bordeaux parlement. Lagebâton ordered an investigation into the organisation that was to be dispatched to the conseil privé, meanwhile Burie discovered the syndicates establishment had not been registered by the parlement and therefore it was an illegal assembly by the terms of the Edict of Saint-Germain. On 12 April the conseil privé declared that the syndicate must cease operation and all its declarations were null.\n\n\n==== Parlements ====\nThe parlement of Rouen proved to be the most pliant to the edict, and registered it first. This was due to the weakness of the ultra-Catholic faction in the court at this time.\nThe parlement of Toulouse secured from the crown the prohibition of Protestantism in towns that had not enjoyed Protestant worship before the publishing of the edict, in addition to a further four towns which were presently enjoying Protestant worship (Carcassonne, Narbonne, Leucate and Agde). When registering it they added the proviso that 'in case of necessity or abuse, it would administer the edict itself'.\nThe parlements of Aix and Grenoble also refused to register the edict. In the parlement of Aix, there were seven judges who defied their colleagues to support registration. The comte de Crussol forced through the adoption of the edict in Provence.\n\n\n==== Catherine's retreat ====\nAs a result of this pushback Catherine began to retreat. On 4 February she attended high mass and participated in a religious procession. She ordered the woman of her suite to demonstrate their Catholicity (and not talk of Protestantism), while her second son the duc d'Orléans was ordered to attend Catholic services.  The young king's new liberal tutors were replaced with those of more firmly orthodox disposition. The queen of Navarre's preacher was expelled from court and Protestant preaching was prohibited at the court. A new interpretative declaration was issued concerning the Edict of Saint-Germain on 14 February by which it was declared that the edict should not be taken as an approval of the diversity of religion in the kingdom. As a final concession French delegates were finally dispatched by Catherine to attend the Council of Trent. Catherine did however instruct them to do their best to obstruct the dogmatism of the other delegates in favour of her more tolerant policies.\nThe queen of Navarre, who now found herself in opposition to her husband was to be dismissed from court after she refused to attend the baptism of the Spanish ambassador's son. The Spanish ambassador threatened to depart himself if it were not done. The king of Navarre had already been campaigning for her to cease her public Protestantism since November, and had begun to consider repudiating her as his wife. He was encouraged in this course by the comte d'Escars and bishop of Auxerre. Navarre made considerations towards a new marriage with Marie Stuart, widow of the late king François II, however nothing came of this. By early 1562, their marriage was destroyed beyond the possibility of repair.\n\n\n=== Württemberg ===\n\nGuise and his brother Lorraine retired themselves to their estates and refused to come to court. While absent from the centre of power Lorraine preached in Reims, delivering a sermon that was viewed by a contemporary as borderline Lutheran in tone. On 31 January they wrote to Catherine to defend their conduct, denying that they were involved in a planned enterprise to deliver the city of Metz to the duc de Lorraine. However the letter was not entirely conciliatory, and implied that they saw importance in protecting their own interests alongside those of the French crown. They informed Catherine they were seeking a marriage between the Austrian erzherzog (archduke) and their niece Marie Stuart.\nUpon invitation, Lorraine and Guise travelled (alongside their brothers the cardinal de Guise and the grand prieur, and Guise's son the prince de Joinville) in February to meet with the herzog von Württemberg (duke of Württemberg) and some Lutheran theologians at Saverne. The duc de Guise had first made contact with Württemberg in July 1561, expressing interest in the confession of Augsburg to the prince and contrasting it with the Calvinist position on the Eucharist. The meeting itself was arranged in December, with the start delayed by Guise's insistence the author of the Württemberg confession be present. The meeting lasted from 15 to 18 February, in the lands of the bishop of Strasbourg. At the meeting it appeared some form of doctrinal agreement was arrived at, in the meanwhile, Guise promised he would not persecute Protestantism. Guise expressed his interest in becoming Lutheran if Lutheranism indeed corresponded with the description Württemberg provided for the faith. During a meeting with the Protestants, Lorraine argued the Catholic faith went too far with how it treated the host, and that mass was an act of commemoration of Christ's sacrifice as opposed to a sacrifice in itself. He further stated that he would gladly trade his red robes for black ones. During their stay, Lorraine continued preaching and made several highly conciliatory sermons in which he endorsed an abandonment of salvation through the saints, salvation through good works and made concessions on the mass towards the Lutheran position. At a more strategic level, Guise and his brother promised to allow the Augsburg confession to be promulgated in France, in return they gained the promise of the powerful herzog that the princes of the Empire would remain neutral in the scenario of a civil war with the Condé. On Calvinism the two sides diverged, with the Lorraine princes seeing the faith as something that is beyond salvaging. For the Lutherans, Calvinists were brothers who had fallen into error.\nSeveral hypotheses exist concerning this meeting, on the one hand that it was a Machiavellian endeavour by the Guise to divide their religious enemies from one another, in another understanding that they were willing to sacrifice the Catholic cause to secure their political strength, finally that they saw in Lutheranism a 'third way' that could secure religious peace in France. Jouanna distinguishes the motivations of Lorraine and Guise for the meeting, arguing the former had a more genuine interest in seeing a religious reunification on Lutheran lines while the latter wished for the neutrality of the German princes in the scenario of a civil war. Durot states that Guise would not have repeated what he stated to 'his friend' Württemberg back in France. He further argues a key purpose of the meeting was to highlight to Württemberg the gulf that existed between Lutheranism and Calvinism ('a sect of rebels that threatens the social order'). Neither Guise nor Lorraine intended to abide by their words to Württemberg to leave the Calvinists in peace. Carroll argues that the meeting was conducted in good faith, but Lorraine and Guise had no intention of becoming Lutherans, rather they hoped for a blending of Lutheranism and Catholicism into a single faith.\n\n\n=== Navarre defects ===\nNavarre, the lieutenant-general of the kingdom was one of the edict of Saint-Germain's most firm opponents. He began to advocate for the return of persecutory measures against Protestantism. He praised the Spanish inquisition and described the creators of the edict of Saint-Germain as 'evil doers'. He made his definitive break with the regency government of which he was a chief component. On 25 January he and Montmorency came before Catherine and the prince accused her of having violated the agreement between the two of them. Navarre alleged Catherine had opened dispatches and responded to them without his cognisance and she only looked to the opinion of the Châtillon brothers. He was horrified by the introduction of Andelot into the conseil des affaires. Catherine argued against this, but Navarre became angry. She said of Montmorency that he could depart court if he desired. Montmorency departed the next day without taking leave of the king. Navarre's defection was a great blow to the regency government, Navarre was not only the head of the royal army but also the premier prince du sang, he thus grants great legitimacy to the 'Triumvirates' cause. He was even able to bring some nobles who were understood to be Protestant with him in his new policy. Back in January, the seigneur d'Auzance had succeeded in securing for him a promise from the Spanish king that in return for the destruction of Protestantism in France, Felipe would seek to compensate Navarre for the loss of his kingdom, Navarre was jubilant upon Auzance return to court. De Bèze reacted to his defection with fury, decrying him as a lost wretch. Navarre affiliated himself with the 'Catholic Triumvirate' of Guise, Montmorency and Saint-André. Catherine, under pressure from the Spanish prohibited Protestant worship at court.\nNavarre again makes a great scene at council on 12 February, arguing that the Châtillon brothers be sent out to their provinces for the execution of the edict. Catherine countered that if they needed to depart court for such purposes, so too did Navarre and the Catholic grandees. Navarre disagreed saying they were needed to work in royal council. Catherine highlighted so too were the Protestants of court. The Spanish ambassador Chantonnay presented her an ultimatum, send the Châtillon from court or break with España. Coligny and his two brothers (d'Andelot and Châtillon) seeing which way the wind was blowing, departed from court in two stages, Coligny and d'Andelot on 17 February, then cardinal de Châtillon a few days later. Coligny retired to his estates, while Andelot went to conduct an inspection of the French infantry. Catherine was greatly angered by their departure according to Tournon. Coligny's departure disheartened his co-religionists and offered the anti-toleration Catholics proof of their strength. Protestants began to lose faith in legal means of influencing the government. Catherine in revenge for the loss of the Châtillon brothers moved to disgrace Saint-André at this time, ordering him to return to his governate. Navarre was incensed by the disgrace of Saint-André and tightened his affiliation with the Catholic party. He rebuked Catherine for seeking to disgrace 'good and valiant captains' while aligning herself with those who are worth less than a 'servants servant'. When Condé protested, Navarre ordered him silent. Catherine, furious, stuck to her demands, and Saint-André departed court. She further demanded the departure of cardinal de Tournon, the man who had negotiated her marriage and who she considered her oldest friend. Tournon was however too sick to comply with the demand so retired to his home at the court. Catherine was left isolated at court.\nNavarre requested of Catherine that she call out to Guise for his return to court, meanwhile Guise made his way back into France from Württemberg travelling to Joinville. Residing at Joinville, Guise was summoned to the capital by Navarre and thus began a progress. Guise intended to see to the abolition of the edict of Saint-Germain upon his arrival. Catherine recognising the court would become fundamentally unbalanced in favour of militant Catholics by his arrival.\n\n\n=== Wassy and war ===\n\nOn Guise's path to return to the French court, he passed through the town of Wassy. While in the town his troops committed a massacre of the towns Protestant population. Outraged, the Protestants at court first protested to Catherine and then moved into rebellion. On 2 April Condé led an army into Orléans and soon thereafter published a manifesto of his rebellion. This began the first French War of Religion.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nBabelon, Jean-Pierre (2009).

        "content": "The First French War of Religion (2 April 1562–19 March 1563) was the opening civil war of the French Wars of Religion. The war began when in response to the massacre of Wassy by the duc de Guise (duke of Guise), the prince de Condé seized Orléans on 2 April. Over the next several months negotiations would take place between the Protestant rebels (led by Condé and admiral Coligny and the royal (largely Catholic) party led by queen Catherine, the king of Navarre, duc de Guise, marshal Saint-André and Constable Montmorency. While the main royal and rebel armies were in discussions, open fighting erupted across the kingdom, with rebel Protestants seizing many of the kingdoms principal cities, and restless Catholics massacring Protestants. Negotiations finally ended at the start of July, with the Protestant army attempting a surprise attack on the royal army.\nThe royal army planned a campaign to clear the Protestant held cities on the Loire before besieging Orléans, the rebel capital. To this end Navarre led the royal army in the capture of Blois, Tours and Bourges during July and August. With momentum slipping away, Condé distributed the rebel army back into the provinces, leaving only a small force in Orléans. Meanwhile, negotiations were undertaken between the Protestant rebels and the English crown with Elizabeth I providing support in return for the surrender of Calais. Conscious of these negotiations the royal army pivoted northwards, hoping to stem any English incursions into the kingdom. Therefore, instead of sieging Orléans it would be Rouen that was besieged next. After almost a month of effort the city was captured and put to the sack. During the siege the king of Navarre was fatally wounded.\nWhile initially planning to follow up the capture of Rouen with a march on English held Le Havre, Guise was suddenly forced to reckon with the Protestant army once more, which emerged from its stay in Orléans and made a dash for the capital. However the Protestant army became bogged down besieging the towns and suburbs of the capital, allowing Guise to secure the city. Forced to break off from Paris, Condé and Coligny turned north and made to Normandie, hoping to secure pay from the English for their army and unify with English reinforcements. The royal army followed them and brought the rebels to battle at Dreux. The battle was a victory for the royalists, though a strongly pyrrhic one, with constable Montmorency captured, Saint-André murdered and much of the royal gendarmerie destroyed. For the rebels, Condé was captured. Coligny withdrew from the field to Orléans with the remainder of the Protestant army. Guise now enjoyed complete ascendency over the royal administration and determined to achieve a final victory with the capture of Orléans. Coligny slipped out of the city with the Protestant cavalry into Normandie, where he began to recapture much of the province. Guise meanwhile worked to reduce Orléans. Shortly before his siege could be finished, he was assassinated and Catherine seized the opportunity to bring the war to a negotiated settlement, achieved in the Edict of Amboise on 19 March 1563.\n\n\n== Prelude ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nWith the death of Henri II in 1559, France was thrown into crisis. His young son François II ascended to the throne, though control of the government was put in the hands of his wife's uncles the duc de Guise (duke of Guise) and cardinal de Lorraine. The Lorraine brothers monopolised royal favour at the expense of the late king's other chief favourites, Constable Montmorency, governor of Languedoc and commander of the French army, and Marshal Saint-André. With the young age of the new king, some felt that a regency should be in effect, and to this end looked to the princes du sang (princes of the blood - king's nearest agnatic relatives outside the family) for leadership. The senior princes du sang were the Bourbon-Vendôme, chief among them the king of Navarre and prince de Condé. While Navarre demurred from leading the opposition, Condé took up the cause. The Lorraine government continued and furthered the policy of persecution that had been undertaken under François II and thus political and Protestant opposition amalgamated. This exploded in March 1560 with the failed conspiracy of Amboise which attempted to remove the Lorraine princes from government and take control of the king. Condé's involvement in the conspiracy was suspected by the government. During the summer he and his brother Navarre schemed, and the reverberations of Amboise continued to shake across France. After being implicated in a further conspiracy in September that attempted to seize Lyon Navarre and Condé were summoned to court.  Once there Condé was arrested, and possibly sentenced to death. At this time, Constable Montmorency's nephew Admiral Coligny established himself as a leader of the Protestant cause during an assembly of notables representing their petitions, much to the annoyance of Guise and Lorraine. In December an estates general was to meet. However, before it could begin, François II died. Henri II's widow Catherine de' Medici now stepped into the political centre, and asserted her right to the formal regency for her second son Charles IX. To do this she negotiated with Navarre who agreed to surrender his rights to the position in return for the release from captivity of Condé. As compensation he was established as lieutenant-general of France in early 1561, giving him supremacy over the French military, and superseding Montmorency. Catherine's government undertook conciliatory moves towards Protestantism. Aggrieved at this, and being ejected from their positions of authority, Guise, Saint-André and Montmorency undertook a reconciliation (known to history as the 'Triumvirate' in April 1561 agreeing to work together during the current crisis to protect Catholicism. Further edicts were established through 1561 that they felt favoured Protestantism. During 1561 Protestantism experienced a massive growth across France and its spread was accompanied by large scale disorders, particularly in the south of the kingdom.  By January 1562 Catherine had resolved that the only way to quiet the disorders was to undertake a limited legalisation of Protestantism on at least a temporary basis. This caused a break between her and the lieutenant-general Navarre who was being courted by the Catholic 'Triumvirate'. Navarre rejected the edict and moved into opposition. He summoned Guise (who was at Saverne) to hurry back into the kingdom to join him in opposing toleration of Protestantism.\n\n\n=== Wassy ===\n\nOn 1 March, the duc de Guise was in Wassy, on the road back to Paris from Saverne with a force of soldiers. He intended to make his way to Éclaron, before going on to the capital. It is possible he had only come to the town at the recommendation of the bishop Jérôme de Bourges who had in the previous December confronted the Protestant congregation of the town, and received insults. De Bèze alleges that Bourges complained to Guise, which spurred the duc to investigate the town. Wassy was home to one of the largest Protestant communities in Champagne.  While in the town he discovered a Protestant service being conducted, with around 600 worshippers present in a barn. He dispatched a few of his number to the barn, who attempted to gain entry but were refused. An exchange of insults between the worshippers and his soldiers quickly escalated. Stones were thrown by those inside the barn, pistols were fired by those outside. His soldiers, enraged, massacred between twenty five and fifty Protestant worshippers who tried to flee the barn, with around another 150 left injured by the incident. Houses were sacked, with Guise claiming to have found a cache of weapons in one of them. The Protestant preacher of Wassy was arrested and then deported to Saint-Dizier. Guise had seigneurial prerogatives over the town as it was part of his niece Marie Stuart's dowry, and in his reckoning the presence of Protestantism challenged his authority and the maintenance of order in his government.\nIn Protestant retellings of the events, Guise was accused of having instigated the massacre intentionally. Guise would maintain until his death that he had not incited the massacre. In Guise's telling, it was the Protestant congregation that had started the violence wounding him in the cheek. The exact sequence of events is hard to reconstruct given the partisans nature of the accounts. Durot argues Guise's intention was to have the preacher arrested, so that the congregation, freed of the pernicious influence could be brought back into the Catholic fold. Guise wrote to the herzog von Württemberg (duke of Württemberg), apologising for the killings and telling him he did not want this incident to sour relations between his family and the Lutherans. He also wrote to his lieutenant-general in Dauphiné, urging him to see to the arrest of Protestant pastors, but to make sure he arrested them when they were separated from their congregations, so as to avoid bloodbaths. Nevertheless, the fault for the massacre, in Guise's mind, lay not with himself but rather the Protestants whose 'law breaking bravado' and 'religious error' caused the deaths. By the former Guise meant that the service was in contravention of the edict of January. He also felt there was an element of 'divine justice' in the affair. While there had been more severe massacres in the past, such as that at Cahors in 1561, the involvement of Guise in this massacre, pre-meditated or otherwise elevated its importance significantly. For contemporary Protestants, it was the first act of the war.\nOnce united with the royal party, the establishment of Guise's innocence and the fault of the Protestants for the massacre became a political priority. On 22 April it was declared by letters patent that Guise had been attacked by the Protestants. Montmorency supported Guise before the parlement (sovereign French court) in their hearing, which concluded in May that Guise had acted justly and in accordance with his rights. Three weeks after the massacre, Guise held an interview with the English ambassador in which he explained the massacre entirely without reference to religion, describing the incident as a case of impudent vassals who had challenged his seigneurial authority. According to Guise, the seditious rabble's behaviour contrasted with his aristocratic stoicism.\nThe massacre of Wassy was the final rupture of any possibility of coexistence between the Catholics and Protestants. In the cities of Sens, Cahors, Tours, Auxerre, Carcassonne and Avignon Catholics responded to news of the massacre by emulating it against their own Protestant communities. Guise was praised as a new 'Jehu' whose actions had avenged the lord. In most cases the massacres were instigated by men in authority, be they preachers, the town governor or a captain. In Angers, the Bourbon duc de Montpensier presided over executions of Protestants. Protestants for their part killed priests and monks, but generally focused their violence against the physical manifestations of Catholicism: relics, statues, churches, art. Wood argues that long before March many local conflicts in the kingdom had already developed the character of armed confrontations. Nicoll states that historians now look to provincial tensions as opposed to courtly aristocratic strife as the origin point of the wars.\nAt this time Condé was back in Paris, experiencing an illness. He had travelled to court in February but was met with some hostility, he therefore returned to Paris in March to oversee the publishing of the Edict of Saint-Germain. He gathered with Protestant nobles in the capital to debate how to proceed. Some favoured a military confrontation with the duc de Guise, but the moderates in the council prevailed and it was agreed to make an appeal to the crown. Nevertheless, a warning was sent out to the Protestant churches of France on 10 March to undertake preparations for their defence. It was stated that they were taking up arms in case the court was unable or unwilling to provide justice for Guise's crime, so that they would not be subject to similar attacks. Coligny advised the churches of the kingdom to be ready to raise footmen and cavalry in case open war broke out in the kingdom.\nAumale arrived back at court on 6 March. The purpose of his presence is speculated as being 'information gathering' by Carroll. Carroll further notes that at this time, Guise was planning either to bring Catherine into line with his program or seize power himself.\n\nOn 8 March word of the butchery at Wassy arrived at the French court, which had just arrived at Montceaux. De Bèze and other Protestant nobles protested the massacre to Catherine demanding of her that Guise be brought to justice. Catherine consented to their requests and summoned Guise to court to explain himself. Navarre then interrupted, and chastised the Protestants for going to sermons under arms, the cardinal di Ferrara supporting his tirade by highlighting the 'sedition' of Saint-Médard. De Bèze again entreated the crown to bring Guise to justice, which aroused Navarre's fury, the prince angrily warning against anyone laying a hand on his 'brother' the duc de Guise. He made it clear that he would stand side by side with Guise. He added that the Protestants of Wassy only got what they deserved for throwing stones at the duc. De Bèze argued that if Guise was indeed innocent of wrongdoing, he would have no difficulty in justifying himself, and justice would not harm him. Guise himself was uninterested in the summons, and continued on to Paris, joining up with his 'Triumvir' allies, Saint-André and Montmorency on route.\n\n\n=== On to Paris ===\nHaving departed Wassy, Guise made first for Éclaron where he spent a few days preparing for a return to court. Continuing onto Paris, news of the massacre travelled out in front of Guise, forcing him to make evasive manoeuvrers to avoid being confronted by furious armed Protestants. In particular he had to avoid Vitry, where 500+ Protestants had taken refuge and assumed arms. He also could not enter Châlons, as the minority Protestant population forbid his entry. Guise rendezvoused with his 'Triumvir' colleagues at his estates of Nanteuil near Paris on 12 March. Alongside Saint-André and Montmorency he joined with Aumale, the comte de Villars (count of Villars), and 600 other gentleman. They tarried in Nanteuil for two days, planning how to proceed.\nIn Paris itself, the situation was tense, when word of Wassy arrived, marshal de Montmorency spoke with the Protestants of the city asking them to cease their worship for several days to avoid violence. The Protestants refused to concede to their adversaries. On 15 March, the day before Guise's arrival, Catholics of the city disinterred a Protestant who had been buried with the new rites. Protestants reburied their compatriot, only to have them disinterred a second time. In this series of disputes over burial several were killed and injured.\n\n\n=== Condé and Guise in the capital ===\n\nOn 16 March Guise and the 'Triumvirate' arrived in Paris, the same day Condé entered the city. Guise was greeted in the manner of a triumph for his actions at Wassy, militant Catholics in the capital celebrating the victory of their 'David' over 'the Philistines'. He was accompanied from the porte Saint-Denis to the hôtel de ville (city hall) by three thousand gentleman. This route was traditionally one taken through Paris by kings. The prévôt des marchands (provost of the merchants) of Paris offered to provide him an army of 20,000 men and a 2,000,000 écus (crowns) subsidy to bring about the pacification of the kingdom. Guise declined the offer, informing the prévôt that he was loyal to the regency government of Catherine and Navarre. Guise, Saint-André and Montmorency wrote to Catherine from the capital that it was necessary for them to remain in the capital to avoid the city descending into street battles.\nAs Guise's procession entered the capital it passed by Condé who was leading a procession of his followers (who numbered around 1,000) to a Protestant service. The leaders of the two processions exchanging salutes with the pommel of their swords as they passed by one another.   On 20 March there was another riot in the capital as a Catholic crowd attempted to disinter a corpse that had been buried with Protestant rites. Bloodshed followed. Guise dispatched marshal de Brissac to the court with instructions to bring Navarre to join with them as he was necessary for the preservation of order, Navarre therefore arrived in the capital on 21 March. After the arrival of Navarre, the lieutenant-general celebrated mass in Notre-Dame with the 'Triumvirate'. According to Brantôme, Saint-André proposed to Guise that they drown Catherine.\nEntreated by De Bèze, Catherine moved to try and contain the potentially explosive situation in Paris. Indeed, some reported that Paris was more like a border town, with the sound of gunfire to be heard in it. By this time there were around 10,000 horsemen in the city. This was particularly true during Easter week which began on 22 March. Pasquier described the processions as being accompanied by gunfire as if it were the percussion. She appointed the suitably neutral figure of the cardinal de Bourbon as governor of the city of Paris. As brother to both Navarre and Condé he had the appropriate credentials to enjoy the confidence of both sides. Bourbon promptly ordered both Guise and Condé to vacate the capital. Condé, in part due to his fear of being attacked by a mob would depart first on 23 March, while Guise, confident of Montmorency's support tarried longer. During March, Catherine also appointed the seigneur de Méru (lord of Méru), another of Montmorency's sons as lieutenant-general of the Île de France.\n\n\n=== Catherine between two camps ===\nAt this time, Catherine, who had moved with her son the king to Fontainebleau, wavered between the Protestant grandees and the Catholic. For a time (from 16 to 26 March) she considered engaging with Condé through his sister-in-law the queen of Navarre. In letters to Condé she protested that she 'saw many things that displeased her' and that her anger at the state of things was restrained by her confidence in him and his advice/support'. An alliance with Condé would have involved locking herself up with the king and Condé in Orléans. At the same time she wrote letters of protest to Coligny on 25 March objecting to his 'raising great companies of troops'. Coligny replied from Meaux that his retinue composed his friends and neighbours and was hardly out of keeping with the behaviour of the duc de Guise.  To pre-empt any moves in this direction, Guise and Montmorency secure the dismissal of the queen of Navarre from the court on 27 March. Catherine would later protest against Condé publishing her private letters she had sent during this time for 'partisan ends'. Catherine claimed that Condé misinterpreted the meaning of the letters.\nCondé for his part ignored the pleas of the queen after his departure from Paris on 23 March. Benedict speculates that this may have derived either from cowardice, or a desire for conflict.\n\n\n=== Control of the monarchy ===\nGuise by contrast did not miss the opportunity to control the crown, and oversaw the bringing back of the royal family to Paris. Both he and the lieutenant-general Navarre had travelled to Fontainebleau to fetch the royal family on 27 March accompanied by a thousand horse. Guise informed Catherine that she and her son were not safe from Protestant attack at Fontainebleau, and it was necessary to come to Paris for their security. Catherine initially protested but Guise informed her of Condé's forces in the area and she yielded to the request. To secure her more genuine support the 'Triumvirs' would establish Catherine in a leadership role.\n\n\n=== Paris under the Triumvirate ===\nOn 1 April in Paris, the sailors who disembarked weapons at the porte (gate) Saint-Antoine made an attempt to assassinate the Protestant preacher Jean Malot. They identified the wrong man, and killed a merchant and several nearby women. On 4 April Montmorency helped inflame the sentiment of the Parisian Catholics by demonstrating the approval of grandees for their actions. He oversaw the destruction of two Protestant temples in the city on 5 April. Accompanied by soldiers and gentleman he tore down a preaching hall known as 'Jerusalem' in the faubourg (suburb) Saint-Jacques, before proceeding to repeat the operation in Popincourt. Arms were seized and distributed to his soldiers. House to house searchers were made to look for Protestant preachers. One was arrested while another escaped, a Protestant parlementaire was also arrested. The crowd of Parisians was keen to join in the destruction, and rushed forward to tear down what was left of the temple at Popincourt, dragging it to the place de Grève where they cast it into a large bonfire to cries of 'god has not forgotten the people of Paris'. Being cast into bonfires would also be the fate of much of the Protestant literature of Paris, with the works of Calvin and de Bèze torched in great pyres in the place Maubert.\nIn the wake of their participation in the destruction of the Protestant temples, the Catholics of Paris formed a new militia.\nThe royal family arrived in Paris on 6 April. Their journey to the city was accompanied by a thousand men-at-arms. They were met by the prévôt des marchands  and much of the bourgeois of Paris and then proceeded to the Louvre. While the Edict of Saint-Germain was not voided, an exemption would be established for the vicomté (viscounty) of Paris within a week of the royal families arrival in the capital by the parlement. Nevertheless, on 9 April, while looting of houses was ongoing, the court did declare that no one was to attack or harm another on account of their religion. On 12 April the court took mass at the grand church of Notre-Dame de Paris. Around this time, chancellor L'Hôpital violently quarrelled with the duc de Montmorency and frustrated departed court to his estates.\nCondé, having left Paris, went first to his estates at La Ferté-sous-Jourre. There he found his wife and made outreach to the Châtillon brothers to join him at Meaux. Coligny for a while was wracked by indecision, unsure whether to join with Condé despite the urgings of his neighbours the sieur de Genlis and the seigneur de Briquemault. Eventually however he resolved on joining with Condé, according to Aubigné at the urgings of his wife. Condé put himself at the head of a force of around 1,800 men. He travelled to Meaux where he rendezvoused with the queen of Navarre (who was returning south to her domains) admiral Coligny and the colonel-general of the French infantry d'Andelot.\n\n\n== Condé's rebellion ==\n\n\n=== Seizure of Orléans ===\nCondé at the head of his army first moved towards Paris around 27/28 March. He set himself up at Saint-Cloud with his forces for a while, however cardinal de Bourbon had seen to the raising of the bridges. Coligny meanwhile had established himself at Montreuil. There was great alarm in Paris as this force of around 3,000 horseman approached, with preparations quickly undertaken to put the city on a siege footing. The prince did not immediately resort to combat, and protested that he had as much right to enter the city under arms as did the duc de Guise. Failing to quickly enforce a settlement upon the crown, and with the royal family now securely in the hands of the 'Triumvirate', Condé ignored a demand from the crown to disarm and marched towards Orléans. There was some urgency in this as the grand maître de l'artillerie (grand master of the artillery) d'Estrées had been dispatched by the royalists to ensure to Orléans' preservation. Though the gates were locked to Condé, his confederates inside the city marched on the gates in arms and opened them to him, Condé thereby assumed control of Orléans. As his troops marched through the city, Protestants cried out 'long live the gospel'. With this act the civil war had begun. Harding argues that for many regions of France, this was not the beginning of the civil war, but just an escalation in an already ongoing conflict. Orléans would prove invaluable as a centre from which to police the Loire for the rebels.\nIt happened that the national synod of the Protestant church was meeting in Orléans on 25 April. It declared that the royal family was in fact hostage of the 'Triumvirate', and that Condé was the protector of the crown. Condé was established by this synod as the protector of the Protestant church in France. Despite the feverish political atmosphere that surrounded the synod, the body itself was largely cautious and conservative in its pronouncements, cautioning churches against making their own ordonnances, a prerogative that belonged to the magistrate.\nCondé issued a manifesto for his rebellion on 8 April. He justified his decision to assume arms and called for military aid. He outlined that as a prince du sang it was his duty to protect the consultative decision-making processes of the kingdom, and that this same status  gave him a natural right to defend the king's subjects against those who might try to oppress them with violence. Largely political in character, it is possible Condé was hoping moderate Catholics, likewise outraged by Wassy would rally to his banner. Condé accused the 'Triumvirs' of holding his brother Navarre in captivity. The manifesto echoed that produced for the conspiracy of Amboise, though now with the open backing of a prince du sang providing it significantly more weight. He was joined in Orléans by the Protestant preacher de Bèze who wrote to the queen of Navarre expressing his disapproval at the rash of Protestant iconoclasm and tomb breaking that some radical Protestants were engaged in during these months (among them Protestants in Vendôme where Navarre was staying who ransacked the graves of the Bourbon-Vendôme ducs.) The queen of Navarre's complicity in the sacking of the churches is a matter of dispute.\n\nOn 20 March, de Bèze had written to all the churches of France, urging them to prepare their defences for the conflict to come. The full mobilisation of the church would be requested by de Bèze and the former bishop of Nevers on 5 and 7 April. The bishop of Arles, who was by 1562 a Protestant, joined Condé's army as a chaplain. In 1563 he provided one of his abbeys to his co-religionists as a fortress, it was quickly seized by the Catholic army.\nAlongside this clerical support Condé had with him in Orléans many Protestant nobles, who signed a separate 'treaty of association' on 11 April. In Durot's estimation this was based on the 'Lords of the Congregation' in Scotland. In total there would be 73 noble signatories. The treaty declared that their purpose was to restore the liberty of the king and his mothers government. The writings not only defended the Edict of Saint-Germain on religious grounds, but also on political, the edict had been established on the advice of the princes du sang, judges of the parlements, and the notables of the court. It therefore had legal power during the minority of a king. It declared that its signatories would not despoil churches or break idols. Among those who signed were the sieur de Beaudiné; the seigneur de La Meilleraye governor of Pont L'Évêque; the lieutenant general of Picardie the sieur de Sénarpont, the governor of Boulogne the seigneur de Morvilliers, La Noue, the comte de La Rochefoucauld (who had recently arrived in Orléans with a large company of Poitevan gentleman), the sieur de Soubise, the seigneur de Piennes, the vicomte de Rohan and the prince de Porcien. According to Carroll, Porcien's motivations for joining the rebellion was a matter of conscience.\nA great number of the nobles come from Condé's governate of Picardie, while many others come from Valois and Brie (where many of his seigneuries lay), Normandie, the Île de France and the south. At this initial stage in mid-April the Protestant force assembled at Orléans numbered around 3,000 men. The arriving volunteers were divided into companies and made subject to exacting military discipline. The manifesto was distributed to foreign governments who were likely to be sympathetic, so that they might proffer him armed support. In sum it was sent to England, the German princes, the  duca di Savoia (duke of Savoia), the Imperial diet and the Stände (Cantons) of the Corpus Helveticum. Calvin offered his open support to Condé's rebellion, something he had not done with the conspiracy of Amboise in 1560. Along with the manifesto, were sent copies of the letters that Catherine had send to Condé during March in which she asked for his support. It was also distributed across France for the purpose of raising an army. Coligny set to work raising money from Genève and took out a loan in Basel to fund the establishment of an army. A military force now totalling around 8,000 men (6,000 foot and 2,000 horse) was present at Orléans. In Coligny's design, this was to be a 'holy army', that did not engage in vices and was solely motivated by its desire to see the preservation of the 'true religion' and the protection of the royal family. The Protestant captain and writer La Noue seemed impressed by the discipline and behaviour of the army.\nThe mustering of such large numbers of soldiers incubated the plague which would resultingly cross northern France along with the armies during the coming months. The core of Condé's army was composed of four compagnies d'ordonnance (the kingdom had around sixty) with the rest of his force composed of volunteers. Condé relied on networks of reciprocity and patronage among the nobility, with each noble who came to his cause bringing their network with them. Some who tried to join with Condé in Orléans were intercepted on the road and imprisoned. Among such figures would be the future famous poet Agrippa d'Aubigné. In total around 10-15% of the French nobility would join one side of the conflict or the other.\nAfter the capture of Orléans, Sancerre and La Charité fell to Condé. The surrounds of Orléans would be swept up into rebel control in July. Sometime between April and June, the comte de Crussol would depart court and join with Condé in Orléans before travelling on to his estates in the Vivarais and retiring from the war for the moment.\n\n\n=== War of words ===\n\nOn 4 May the 'Triumvirate' made their first written declaration. In this declaration Saint-André, Montmorency and Guise affirm that to protect god and the kingdom, it was not possible to tolerate religious pluralism in the kingdom. Those who had taken up arms must cast them down immediately as only the lieutenant-general Navarre has the right to raise an army.\nThe war of words did not end with the initial declarations, and Condé issued a further response to the royal court on 19 May. In this document he argued that those who wished to change the Edict of Saint-Germain and impose a new one that demanded religious uniformity were but three 'private persons' who much like the original Triumvirs of Marc Antony, Lepidus and Augustus wished to undermine the laws of the republic. By their arbitrary proposals they wanted to make law against the law of the kingdom. Condé informed the reader that he by contrast had no private motive. During these years, many pieces of art were created depicting the massacres perpetrated by the original Triumvirate.\nFor the royalist side, the famous poet Pierre Ronsard composed verse which blamed the chaos of France on the actions of the Protestants. This was met with sharp invectives in response from the pastor La Roche-Chandieu and Bernard de Montméja both of whom wrote back under pseudonyms.\nNot all writers were as bellicosely committed to a side as Ronsard. Jean de la Taille bemoaned a situation where father would be turned against son, and wife against husband.\n\n\n=== Moves of the royal family ===\n\nOn 22 April the royal family, Montmorency, Navarre and Guise visited the Royal Arsenal. Having dined they inspected the artillery pieces and fired some test rounds.\nTo signal to their detractors that they were not prisoners of the 'Triumvirate', the royal family then departed to the Château de Montceaux on 14 May, before Catherine decided to send her children to the Château de Vincennes for their security. Catherine's denial that and her son were captives of the 'Triumvirate' fatally undermined Condé's declarations and recast him as a rebel. What had transpired in Wassy could now be characterised as a riot, meanwhile Condé's seizure of a great city of the kingdom was a clear act of rebellion.\nThe Château de Vincennes, constructed under the direction of Charles V and boasted a level of security which could deter any attempted surprise attack by Protestant forces. The royal children were accompanied by two hundred gentleman, and a further three hundred soldiers under the authority of Piero Strozzi.\n\n\n=== Negotiations ===\nShortly after their arrival in Orléans, Coligny and d'Andelot made an offer to the crown for a meeting with Catherine. The conditions of this meeting would be that, Montmorency's son Damville, Navarre's son the prince de Béarn and a member of the Lorraine family would be kept in Orléans as hostages. While Catherine was open to the proposal, Navarre, Guise and Montmorency all protested strongly.\nOn the same day as he made his declaration, a diplomatic mission was despatched by the crown to treat with Condé. It consisted of two of the four secrétaires d'État - secretaries of state - (Alluye and Fresne) alongside the surintendant des finances (superintendent of the finances) the seigneur de Gonnor. After a brief stay in Orléans they departed on 10 April. A second diplomatic mission was sent out by the crown 3 days later, this one consisting of Alluye and Gonnor. Finally on 24 April a third effort was made, this one comprising de Laubespine and the bishop of Orléans. Before his departure on 2 May, the bishop of Orléans bore witness to the sack of his Cathedral in Orléans. As the Protestant party witnessed success throughout April with the acquisition of many cities across France, Navarre and Montmorency's opposition to a negotiated settlement faltered. They were held back from reshaping the royal policy by Guise and marshals Saint-André and Brissac who remained uninterested in compromise. At the Protestant end the diplomatic efforts were stymied by Coligny, who feigned illness during the visit of the ambassadors. Arriving back at the Louvre the diplomats walked the gardens with Catherine, Montmorency and Navarre. They reported that Condé demanded in exchange for backing down and disarming that the 'Triumvirs', Montmorency, Guise and Saint-André all disarm and withdraw from court. Condé further wished to see the Edict of Saint-Germain fully implemented. The secrétaires were troubled by their mission, seeing clearly that there was little sign that a compromise could be reached. They greatly feared the escalation of the civil war that was surely to follow the failure of their missions. De Laubespine bemoaned the mercenaries being raised by each side, which would surely result in depredations of the kingdom. The demand that the 'Triumvirs' depart from court was met coldly by Catherine, who rejoindered that it was not appropriate for a king to be denied the presence of the great men of his kingdom during his minority.\nA meeting was undertaken between the two sides at Thoury. Each side was composed of one hundred gentleman with thirty horse. Leading the Protestants were Condé, the three Châtillon brothers and La Rochefoucauld, for the royalists Catherine, Navarre, Damville. Both parties stopped 800 paces apart while the talks were undertaken. A two-hour interview followed. Catherine informed Condé that it was not possible to enforce the edict of Saint-Germain as the greater parts of France were opposed to it. Though the meeting was a failure, both sides were allowed to approach each other so that they could exchange greetings and embraces. Upon departing many of the gentleman were tearful. Having returned to Orléans, Condé wrote to Navarre on 13 June expressing his regrets at the failures of Thoury, causing his brother to weep upon receipt of the letter.\nCatherine and Navarre conducted three interviews with Condé at the end of June from 27 to 29 of that month. These took place at the abbey Saint-Simon near Talcy. However they was unable to convince him to back down from his rebellion. She offered Condé exile from France until such time as Charles reached his majority, however this was unacceptable for Coligny who brought with him much of the rest of the army in his opposition. For a time during the conference, it seemed possible a deal for peace might be reached. Fresne even began drafting letters to be sent out into the provinces for the enforcement of its terms, however this would not come to pass. When he returned to the Protestant camp to work out some details of Condé's exile Fresne found that there had been a change of mind, and he warned Catherine to this effect. Realising that armed confrontation would be necessary as no compromise was possible, Catherine remarked 'since you rely on your forces, we will show you ours'. Catherine was greatly frustrated by the failure, blaming malicious individuals around Condé who had poisoned his mind against the plan.\nIt was only on 16 June that Catherine used the term 'civil war' for the first time in her correspondence, though even at this point it was something that could happen if negotiations failed. On 22 June she spoke for the first time of the civil war as a present reality. Sutherland therefore takes June as the beginning of the civil war.\nColigny entreated separately with his uncle Montmorency, in an effort to convince him that his alliance was disadvantageous to his person and the reputation of his house. Coligny argued that the nobility would come to despise his house as a result of his actions. Montmorency replied that he had acted as a second father to Coligny, and that he was saddened to see him in league with the rebels. The Constable assured Coligny he was working only towards the honour of the king and god.\n\n\n=== Phoney war ===\nDuring the negotiations, the royal forces that had assembled gathered on the Loire so that they might be prepared to begin campaigning should the negotiations fail. Having set out the army arrived at Montlhéry on 1 June. They undertook a showdown with the Protestant army, getting as close to Orléans as Pithiviers. The royal force then made a thrust towards Jargeau, to which Coligny and d'Andelot responded by destroying the bridge so that the town could not be used to cut off Orléans. The royal army therefore moved towards Beaugency, where it was shadowed by the Protestant army, the two sides arriving a few kilometres apart from one another south of the river on 15 June. Navarre proposed a truce of 6 days, so that he might meet with Condé beneath the walls of Beaugency so they could discuss peace. Though Navarre caused anger in the Protestant camp by the behaviour of his soldiers in Beaugency, the talks between the brothers were profitable, with a preliminary agreement for the Protestant rebels to submit to royal justice in return for the departure to their estates of the Triumvirs. After the expiration of the truce on 21 June, the two sides engaged in some half hearted skirmishes while perfunctory negotiations continued. The royal army then departed towards Blois.\n\n\n== Provincial conflicts ==\n\nIn response to Condé's manifesto, Protestants rose up and seized Lyon, Tours, Amboise, Saumur, Poitiers, Caen, Bayeux, Dieppe, Blois, Valence, Rouen, Angers, Le Havre, Grenoble, Auxerre, Beaugency, Montpellier, Mâcon and Le Mans among other places. In total the Protestants would seize around a third of the 60 largest cities in the kingdom. By the seizure of towns and cities the Protestants not only ensured their safety but also added bargaining chips they could use for future negotiations with the crown. The majority of the seizures were undertaken by surprise and with collaboration between a group inside the town or city and Protestant nobles/soldiers outside the walls. Those in the city often seized a gate or section of the wall, then allowed the external troops in to overwhelm the garrison before it could mobilise.\nMany of these town seizures were accompanied by the murder of priests and monks, and acts of ideological vandalism. This was directed against the religious paraphernalia of Catholicism as it had been in the prior years, but also against the tombs of royal predecessors, such as that of Louis XI. The great success of the Protestants in seizing cities was a reflection of the exploitation of the urban privileges which had not yet been eroded by the monarchy. By the seizure of cities, the Protestant rebels saw the acquisition of useful privileged and enclosed spaces. Control of cities would be the anchor around which the Protestant strategy revolved. Control of the countryside was a lower priority for both the Protestants and their Catholic opponents.\nIn the south, the Protestants took control of Nîmes, La Charité-sur-Loire, Sancerre, Nérac, Castres, Montauban and the towns of Béarn. These occupations would prove more long lasting than many of the ephemeral northern occupations. Indeed, some of the Protestant controlled communities in the Midi would remain under their authority for much of the period until 1598.\nThe lieutenant-general of the province of Dauphiné, La Motte-Gondrin was assassinated in Valence on the orders of the Protestant baron des Adrets. A brutal commander (characterised by one historian as a 'bloodthirsty thug') Adrets was able to reduce the region to obedience of the rebel cause. His campaign was one of terror for the Catholic population. For a while he even threatened the Papal territory of Avignon. In Languedoc, the Protestant commander Beaudiné was ascendant. In Guyenne and Gascogne the seigneur de Duras and comte de Gramont, both protégés of the queen of Navarre, campaigned for the Protestant cause. While in Provence it would be the seigneur de Mauvans.\nThese men were variously opposed by the lieutenant-generals and subordinates of the provinces: the vicomte de Joyeuse in Languedoc, Maugiron in Dauphiné, Saint-Forgeaux in Auvergne, and finally the seigneur de Monluc in Guyenne (Monluc would be made lieutenant-general in December 1562). Maugiron was a client of Guise, and Guise could also count on the governors of Grenoble, Gap and Tour-du-Pin to support him. Of similar religious proclivities to Joyeuse in Languedoc was the key governor of Narbonne, the seigneur de Forquevaux. In Guyenne, Monluc was supported by the comte d'Escars, the governor of Bayonne and the lieutenant-general of Guyenne the seigneur de Burie. For a while this group of loyalists were unable to resist the wave of Protestant successes.\n\n\n== Royal campaign ==\n\n\n=== Royal army ===\nWith no peace possible, Catherine prepared herself for war. She conducted a review of German mercenaries that had been recruited by the crown at Charenton with her two eldest sons. The German mercenaries were commanded by princes of the empire: the herzog von Sachsen-Weimar (duke of Sachsen-Weimar), the markgraf von Baden-Baden (margrave of Baden-Baden) and the graf von Mansfeld (count of Mansfeld). The arrière ban was declared, which compelled all noble vassals of the king to offer their service for several months, this was despite the fact many nobles preferred to serve as volunteers.\nTemporary companies were also raised alongside the compagnies d'ordonnance, these were popular with noble volunteers who did not wish for the 'indignity' of serving with the royal infantry.\n\n\n==== Foreign friends ====\nOutreach was conducted for military support from Felipe II king of España, the Pope, and the duca di Savoia (duke of Savoia). Back in April Catherine had secured a loan of 200,000 écus from the Pope. It was agreed that he would donate half the sum and loan the other half. He also opened inquisition proceedings against the cardinal de Châtillon. With an army of 14,000 infantry raised domestically she secured promises on 10 May of a further 10,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry from Felipe II; and 3,000 infantry and 400 cavalry from the duca di Savoia. Not all the French infantry that the crown had was brought to bear in the royal army as the removal of the infantry from the fortresses of Metz and Calais could not be countenanced, even during this time of civil war. Felipe would pay for his soldiers during their French service, while Catherine paid for the services of a further 10,550 Germans, 2,600 Swiss and 2,000 Italian soldiers. This was despite the financial difficulties Felipe was experiencing at the time. In the end, Felipe would only provide around 3,000 of the soldiers he promised. The secrétaire d'État de Fresne wrote to the governor of Bayonne, the vicomte d'Orthe in May to let him know to expect 3,000 Spanish soldiers to arrive around Bayonne. On 8 April an agreement had been reached with the graf (count) von Roggendorf for him to provide 1,200 reiters and he entered the country with his mercenary force in early July.  The Swiss had built their reputation as infantrymen during the Italian Wars and therefore the French crown regularly renewed the contract it had with the region. The Swiss Catholic force was commanded by colonel Pfyffer. Their prowess was known, and the German mercenaries modelled their fighting on them.\nThe core of the royal army comprised seven companies that constituted the king's household force. This was supplemented in 1562 by a further eight companies which were called the 'kings guard'. This would constitute the nucleus of the main bulk of the army, the sixty-five compagnies d'ordonnance of men-at-arms (totalling around 6,500 men). These companies of heavy cavalry had been established in the final days of the Hundred Years War. The gendarmerie though still largely noble, was less purely so than it had been in the reign of François I. Thus it was necessary for both commoners and mercenaries to be added to the ranks of this institution. Due to defections of many nobles to the rebel side, the royal army in June boasted only around 22 gendarme companies. Therefore, the crown authorised the creation of 22 new companies, and bolstered the strength of many of the existing companies. The crowns three regiments of infantry remained loyal and fought in the Bourges campaign. Over the course of the civil war they would be supplemented by a further five regiments. Most of the captains that had been established by the colonel-general of the French infantry d'Andelot joined the rebel Protestants with him and fought at Rouen. D'Andelot was replaced in his charge by Randan for the royalist cause at the start of the war. The crown authorised its provincial governors to enact extraordinary impositions, be it forced loans or requisitions. This system of latitude to governors for financial decisions would remain in force for the vast majority of the next forty years.\n\n\n=== Rebel army ===\nBy June the Protestants had around 20,000 soldiers assembled at Orléans. The Protestants received a further 5,200 infantry from their supporters in the southern provinces. Many of the Protestant soldiers comprised the urban bourgeois. In the Protestant army there were three arquebusiers for every pikeman, while in the royal army there were two pikeman for every arquebusier. Le Roux explains this as a product of the greater professionalism in the royal army (due to the skill needed to wield a pike) in comparison with the rebel force.\n\n\n==== Foreign aid ====\nThe Protestants looked to Elizabeth I of England and the German Protestant princes for support. Over the course of the war, Condé sent nine diplomatic missions to the Swiss cantons in the hope of support. The sieur de Soubise was in the cantons during July to this end. Genève refused direct requests to recruit its citizens, pleading that they must maintain a technical neutrality as the city was threatened by the armies of Nemours and Savoia. A diplomatic mission was sent to the duca di Savoia composed of Coligny's ward Téligny to 'inform him of the true nature of what had transpired at Wassy' in the hopes he would be at worst a neutral party to the conflict. Andelot was tasked with raising mercenaries for the army in the Holy Roman Empire. He was supported in this endeavour by Calvin, who chided the churches of France for their tight fistedness in providing financial support to Andelot's recruitment efforts.\n\n\n=== Treaty of Hampton Court ===\nAs early as March, outreach had been conducted by the Protestant rebels towards the English, with the seigneur de Briquemault despatched by Coligny to negotiate. However at the time nothing had come of it as England was not keen to jeopardise its commercial position in Spanish Nederland. Elizabeth assured the Protestants of her moral support and desire to see their success. She was informed by her ambassador of the risk that Calais could fall to the Spanish. Eventually however Elizabeth began to see the prospect of regaining Calais, and avoiding Spanish domination of France as worth the risk of intervention.\nNegotiations were opened between the Protestants and the English on 15 August. The vidame de Chartres and a representative of Rouen were dispatched to treat with her. Elizabeth extracted humiliating terms from the two Protestant leaders. In return for her support she demanded the restitution of Calais to English control, and until such time as they could provide Calais she would take Le Havre as surety. In return they would receive subsidies and men. In total this constituted 6000 men and 100,000 écus (crowns). Le Havre would be returned, after both Calais and the loaned money had been returned to the English. Elizabeth promised that should as a result of the treaty, the leading Protestant nobles lose their French lands, that she would afford them pensions and lands in England for their exile. The convention of Hampton Court was signed by the two parties on 20 September. Elizabeth took control of Le Havre on 29 August.\nThe seigneur de Briquemault urged Elizabeth to be patient in the receipt of Calais, arguing that it would be delivered at the time appointed by the treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis, however Elizabeth rejected this out of hand.\nThe treaty, which involved the surrender of French held towns to the English was for Condé likely a temporary expedient, as evidenced by his involvement in the recapture of Le Havre from the English the following year. Mariéjol argues that in the heat of war, neither he nor Coligny may have looked too closely at the specific terms of the treaty. When the treaty was published in Orléans by the Protestant rebels, the terms that afforded the English control of Le Havre were excised from the translated text. Nevertheless, many gentleman of the rebel cause were disquieted by the treaty. In response to the treaty, the seigneur de Morvilliers (governor of Boulogne and the commander of Rouen for the rebels) and the sieur de Genlis retired from the civil war. Genlis' retirement from the conflict brought his close friend Grammont under suspicion in the Protestant camp. The lieutenant-general of Picardie the sieur de Sénarpont and his son also retired from Orléans to their estates in disgust.\n\n\n=== Royal declarations ===\n\nDuring the summer, the cardinal de Lorraine devised a new Gallican confession of faith in which the mass would be spoken in vernacular, 'idolotrous images' removed from churches and communion be taken in both kinds. Once the Sorbonne had corrected the translations he also approved of the psalms being sung in French. By this means he approached the Lutheran position. It was intended that this would direct the position of the French delegates at the council of Trent. This confession was developed in secret while the peace negotiations were ongoing, and would later be suppressed. Chancellor L'Hôpital sarcastically remarked that the first reform of the French church could be Lorraine resigning his benefices. According to a Protestant libel Montmorency opposed the proposals in council and refused to sign. Carroll argues Navarre would have been a supporter of this confession of faith. Due to the disunity at court as to opinions on the confession the plan could not be made public during a time of war. Lorraine would take this confession with him when he departed for the council of Trent on 19 September.\nOn 27 July, the crown declared that all Protestants must return to observance of the Catholic faith. Coligny was declared by the crown to be a rebel at this time. All royal officials were to take an oath in favour of Catholicism, or lose their position. On 13 July the parlement of Paris further permitted ordinary French citizens to kill heretics without fear of being prosecuted if they were committing iconoclasm or holding illicit assemblies. Condé reacted angrily to the declarations of the parlement announcing that the body was under the control of Guise and his lackies on 8 August. On 18 August the parlement ordered that the arrest of Coligny, d'Andelot, La Rochefoucauld, Montgommery, Rohan, Genlis, Piennes and Morvilliers be undertaken, among other gentleman. This would be furthered on 16 November when Coligny was sentenced to death, his title of Admiral forfeit to his cousin Damville while his companies of soldiers were to be split among other cousins.\n\n\n=== Condé's indecision ===\n\nWith negotiations over, the first plan of the Protestant army was to launch a surprise attack on the royal army which was stationed at Talcy. To this end they set out on 2 July in the night, so that they might time their attack wile the enemy was asleep. Coligny led the vanguard while Condé was with the rear. However, during the night the force became lost, and with dawn breaking they were spotted by the royal army. Therefore, the attack was reconsidered and the army turned towards Beaugency.\nAfter his capture of Beaugency on 3 July, Condé became listless. With an army of around 9,000 men, he made back to Orléans. He variously considered joining forces with the baron des Adrets, the queen of Navarre or heading into Normandie to reinforce Rouen. In the end lethargy prevailed, and he and Coligny locked themselves up in Orléans, the majority of their army dispatched into the provinces or discharged. Soubise departed for Lyon, Porcien for Strasbourg, d'Ivoy for Bourges, La Rochefoucauld for Poitou, d'Andelot for the Empire, and the comtesse de Roye departed for Strasbourg with Condé's children.\n\n\n=== Royal capture of Blois, Tours and Bourges ===\n\n\n==== Blois ====\nTowards the end of June Navarre led the royal army out against Orléans. When it became clear that Condé had dispersed his captains to their provinces the urgency of protecting Paris with such a thrust dissipated. Navarre submitted a memorandum to Catherine by which he proposed dividing the royal army into four, with small columns under the ducs d'Aumale and Montpensier and marshal Saint-André to secure Rouen, Guyenne and Lyon respectively while the main royal army focused on Orléans. The estimates involved in the plan totalled the royal army at 46,000 men and relied on the involvement of many foreign mercenaries to reach. Catherine approved the commanders and the plan but cautioned the reliance on mercenaries. The strength of the force that would be present for the recapture of Blois would be roughly 23,350 comprising 17,000 infantry, and somewhat over 5,000 cavalry. The royal army also boasted around 22 artillery pieces.\nIn the end, the main royal army under Navarre's authority turned its attentions to clearing the Loire, securing first Blois on 4 July, the town was sacked and pillaged with much the same brutality as Beaugency had been by the Protestants. The grandees of Blois had come to Guise with the keys of the city, only for him to gesture at his cannon and inform him that this was his key.\n\n\n==== Tours ====\nTours fell next to the royal army. Montpensier back in charge of his city had monks draw up a confession of faith which all inhabitants were to swear to uphold before witnesses or be put to death. On 17 July around 200 Protestants of the city were knocked out and then drowned in the Loire. One notable of the city was disembowelled and had his head thrown into the Loire, while his heart was paraded around on a pole.\n\n\n==== Bourges ====\nThe royal army then crossed the Loire for the purpose of an attack on Bourges. Bourges was put to siege on on 19 August. The city boasted a strong garrison of around 3,500 men who enjoyed plentiful provisions, even with a garrison of this size however, the walls were of great length. The royal artillery had now been augmented to around 30 pieces. While the siege was ongoing, Coligny succeeded in a surprise attack on a train of 6 large artillery pieces that was making its way towards Bourges while it was on the road from Chartres. He was however unable to bring back the artillery to Orléans as the draft animals had fled, so he had it burned in a large bonfire. This attack and the loss of the royal powder had the potential to reverse the fate of Bourges, however the siege was concluded before word of Coligny's coup arrived. Bourges fell on 31 August for the royal cause, the culmination of a rapid series of conquests. The city was taken, not by military means but by negotiation, the Protestant commander the sieur d'Ivoy capitulating the city after an interview with Catherine in return for his troops departing in honour. He renounced his oath to Condé as part of the capitulation. The city itself paid an indemnity of 50,000 livres (pounds) in return for securing \"life, property and liberty of conscience\" to those of the city. While this was generally observed, the German mercenary commander did not abide by it. The capture of Bourges severed the Protestant forces on the Loire from their southern compatriots. It was a disaster for the Protestant war effort. Durot argues, it was Guise and not Navarre who was the architect of the victory at Bourges.\n4,000 Spanish soldiers provided by Felipe II arrived in Bordeaux at this time (10 August). On 1 September, Catherine and the king entered Bourges. With the fall of Bourges, the road to Orléans was open. At this time Navarre departed to the court of the duchesse di Ferrara (duchess of Ferrara) at Montargis where his son the prince de Béarn, future king Henri IV was staying for his safety. Navarre was potentially concerned his son could either be kidnapped by his brother the prince de Condé or alternatively handed over as a hostage to the Spanish. The duchessa di Ferrara had established herself back in France in 1560 and acted as a protector to Protestants. The young prince de Béarn had come down with measles, and while Navarre was present, he asked permission to join his father on campaign, Navarre refused.\nThe royal army debated how to follow up their successes of the proceeding months. Navarre advocated an immediate push on Orléans. He found himself opposed on this due to the plague that was blighting Orléans, and the crowns hopes that he might be able to secure the city without a fight by achieving the defection of his brother. Indeed, de Bèze would later claim that 10,000 died in the city as a result of the terrible conditions at this time. There was also the risk of an English invasion. This caused the royal army to reorientate their direction north, to stop further incursion into Normandie. The army decided to attack Rouen, both due to the risk of English support linking up with the Protestants and the potential ability of the controller of Rouen to strangle Paris' supply. While the main royal army would move towards Rouen, a blocking force would be left around Orléans.\n\n\n=== Royal reduction of Rouen and the death of Navarre ===\n\nHaving rejoined the royal army Navarre and the duc de Guise took joint command for the reduction of Rouen. Their army at this time totalled around 30,000 men in strength with 45 artillery pieces and 3,000 pioneers among its number. Rouen's defence was led by the comte de Montgommery. The Protestant commander had at his disposal a garrison of around 4,000 men. His force was undisciplined and had previously brutalised sympathetic elements of the population of Dieppe. Therefore, requests had gone out to Coligny for his replacement with Martel. The Protestant hold of the city was a particular threat as it was to be reinforced by a force of English soldiers dispatched by Elizabeth. Elizabeth's support to the city would be weak however, and by the time the first 200 soldiers arrived on 4 October, the city had already been invested. She did not at first put much priority on support of the Protestants in the city, more focused on the prospect of receipt of Calais, however it became apparent as October continued that if the royalist forces were successful at Rouen, then the English hold of Le Havre could be jeopardised. Therefore, six ships were dispatched up the Seine, of which five made it into the city, providing around 600 men.\nThe combined leaders of the royal army succeeded first in seizing the fortress of Sainte-Catherine which offered great command over Rouen on 6 October. Catherine joined the leaders in the fort after it fell so that she might observe the progress of the siege herself. This caused Guise and Montmorency to warn her of the dangers, which she dismissed. With forte Sainte-Catherine secured, Catherine again pushed for a negotiated settlement with Rouen, little desiring to see one of the kingdoms richest cities subject to a sack. Many merchants and bourgeois in the city were willing to compromise, but the comte de Montgommery and the more radical elements of Rouen's defence (Protestant refugees who had fled from elsewhere in Normandie and in Maine) refused the offers. Sainte-Catherine was turned into an artillery battery which could bombard the ramparts where the attack was to be made. Both commanders (Guise and Navarre) were in the habit of walking through the frontline trenches in the manner of the common soldier, and it was on one of these visits on 16 October, than Navarre was pierced by an arquebus shot from the city. The wound was not initially considered to be fatal, but doctors, including the famed surgeon Ambroise Paré were unable to remove the bullet. Guise was also wounded during the course of the siege.\nGuise continued the siege, and several days later stormed into Rouen on 26 October. Those Protestant leaders that could, fled by ship, scattering across Normandie. Among those who escaped was Montgommery who took a galley off down the Seine leaving behind his wife and children in the city. The governor of Normandie, Bouillon allowed him to depart. Guise tried to prevent his soldiers sacking Rouen, promising a bonus in pay for the successful conclusion of the operation, but it was of no use. The city was subject to a brutal pillaging with much killing and raping. Protestant houses were looted, and the Catholic residents, had to hurriedly return so they could bribe the soldiers not to sack their houses. Even Catholic churches were subject to the violent pillage. After three days the sacking ceased. The Spanish ambassador estimated that there had been around 1000 casualties among the defenders and population. From the surrounding area merchants came to Rouen so that they could buy up the looted property the soldiers had secured.\nThe Protestant sieur de Randan, brother of La Rochefoucauld was a high-profile Protestant casualty of the siege. In retaliation for the murder of several high-profile Protestants during the sacking of Rouen, Condé ordered the execution of an abbot and a parlementaire who were in his captivity.\nNavarre was carried in a litter for the victorious armies entrance into the defeated city. Over the next month Navarre slowly faded away until, on 16 November, while on a barge to be transported back to the capital he died. In his final moments he expressed interest in Lutheranism, and urged a valet who was with him to serve his son well, and for his son to serve the king well. He would be succeeded as governor of Guyenne by his young son. Condé claimed that he succeeded his brother as lieutenant-general of the kingdom, but the crown resolved to transfer the deceased prince's authority to the cardinal de Bourbon.\nFor some Protestants Navarre's death was a punishment from god and they ridiculed the circumstances of his fatal injury. The seigneur de Soubise remarked that it was the comeuppance for those who rejected the grace of god.\nWith the reduction of Rouen, many royal troops were dismissed for the winter, on the assumption the campaign season would go dormant until the following spring.\n\n\n=== German reiters ===\n\nOn 22 September, d'Andelot crossed the Rhine on his way back to France with the force of German mercenaries he had been able to recruit in the Empire. This force numbered around 7,300 men. It was composed of roughly 4,000 landsknechts and 3,000 reiters. They had been recruited from three principal sources: the Landgraf Hessen (the Landgrave of Hessen), the herzog von Württemberg (who Guise had met with in February) and the Kurfürst von der Pfalz (elector of the Palatine) who was converting from Lutheranism to Calvinism in 1562. After tarrying for a while in Strasbourg while d'Andelot was wracked with illness and struggling for money, the force made its way into France. They entered the kingdom at Montéclair and made their way through Champagne, passing by Chaumont and pillaging the Franciscan monastery near Châteauvillain where they took 300 captives. The prince de Porcien joined with the mercenary army as it made its progress. Saint-André was ordered to take much of the royal armies cavalry and the blocking force around Orléans to intercept d'Andelot. Nevers, Aumale and Saint-André were entrusted with the duty of stopping the forces advance, to do this they were allowed to levy forces in Champagne and Bourgogne, however they were unable to intercept d'Andelot's army. Aumale's cautious reticence to engage the mercenaries led to much criticism from his soldiers. Nevers was accused by the English ambassador of having consented to the mercenaries passing by him. The mercenaries made their way into Orléans to join up with the main rebel army, which they achieved juncture with on 6 November. D'Andelot had to be escorted into the city on a litter due to his exhaustion.\nShortly before the arrival of the mercenary army into Orléans, both La Rochefoucauld and Duras had arrived in the city. The former with 300 horseman while the latter brought what was left of his army after the savaging it had received at the battle of Vergt.\nTo fund this mercenary army, the Protestant rebels had to impose a taille (land tax) upon the populations they controlled. This was complemented with looting of churches and the melting down of their precious metals.\n\n\n=== Manoeuvrers ===\n\nWith the successful conclusion of the Rouen siege, Guise planned first to march further into Normandie and drive the English from their hold of Le Havre. However, on 8 November, Condé emerged from Orléans and made a thrust towards Paris with the support of the recently returned d'Andelot and his mercenaries. In total the rebel army numbered around 20,000. Shortly before he departed, a Protestant minister urged him to purge his army of 'thieves and fornicators' so that they might avoid god's wrath. The first town on the path to Paris was Pithiviers which was conquered on 11 November, with the garrison being spared for their having surrendered while the priests of the town were executed. The sieur de Gonnor was dispatched by Catherine to treat with Condé and he arrived at the Protestant camp at Pithiviers, offering acceptance of the Protestant's religious demands in return for the prince assuring the kingdom would be rid of Germans and the English. Assurances were demanded however, and nothing came of the proposal. In Thompson's estimation the negotiations were not undertaken in good faith. The army returned to the advance and succeeded in capturing Étampes (an important grain depot) on 13 November and Montlhéry. This accomplished Condé looked to capture Corbeil, beginning a siege of the settlement on 16 November. Corbeil was however strongly defended, with command  led by Saint-André (who had rushed into Corbeil before the Protestants could close the siege lines) and this slowed Condé's progress. Condé was also slowed by his armies propensity for sacking every village on the approaches to Paris.\nNegotiations were undertaken once more a little while later, largely in service of slowing Condé's advance. These took place at the port Langlois and in a mill in the faubourg Saint-Marceau. The talks were conducted between the Constable for the royalists and his nephew Coligny for the rebels.\nOn 27 November Coligny led the vanguard of the rebel army in an attempted surprise attack on the Parisian faubourgs of Saint-Marceau and Saint-Victor, however it was easily rebuffed. With this a failure an attempt to surround the capital was undertaken in the final days of November. Porcien established himself at Gentilly, Genlis with the infantry at Montrouge and Vaugirard, Coligny and Condé at Arcueil and the German mercenaries at Cachan. The royalists refused battle and instead returned to negotiations designed to buy time to build further forces. Resolving to initiate the fight themselves, Coligny decided to undertake another night-time assault on 5 December, however as with the prior attempt at this plan, the force got lost in the dark and dawn broke, therefore the plan was called off. A further plan for battle on 6 December was called off after Condé began to fear that Genlis had revealed the plans of attack to the royalists in the city. Instead of planning further assaults it was agreed among the rebel Protestant leadership to withdraw from the city.\n\n\n=== Paris ===\nIn Paris, as Condé began his thrust the Parisians planned radical means of defence. The suburbs were to be razed to provide clean lines of fire, reinforce the fortifications and bring in more troops. The Venetian ambassador notes how little of this came to pass. Paris was short on food as a result of extended rains during the summer. As a result of this the price of bread rose greatly. Prices increased further after the loss of Étampes and with refugees flooding into the city from Paris' surrounds. On 6 December the Paris militia was requested to join with Guise who was holding the faubourg Saint-Jacques due to the failure of royal reinforcements to arrive as expected. After Spanish and Gascon troops arrived Condé decided he could not negotiate an advantageous settlement and decided to withdraw from the capital on 9 December. Condé was despondent at his failures in front of Paris.\n\n\n=== Drive north ===\n\n\n==== Protesant march ====\nOn the morning of 10 December the Protestant army decamped from Paris and began making towards Chartres. The march was slowed by issues with their artillery train which necessitated stopping the progress for two days at Saint-Arnoult. The Protestant army had little hope of crossing the river Seine, as the Pont de l'Arche was watched by royalist German mercenaries. An assault on Chartres was floated for a time, until it became clear both how large a garrison the city possessed and the fact that the royal army was in close pursuit. The two commanders Condé and Coligny were increasingly in opposition to one another as to how they should proceed. On 16 December the army held council at the village of Ablis. Condé argued that now the royal army had left Paris they should swing round and attack the weakly defended city, trapping the royal army in front of Étampes. Coligny meanwhile wished to head into Normandie to get pay for the German mercenaries and unify with the English troops from Le Havre thereby resolving their numerical deficiencies. It would be Coligny's plan that was adopted and the army crossed the Eure near Maintenon on 17 December. The army fell into confusion at this point, with the main body under Condé ending up in front of the vanguard that was under Coligny. A day was spent re-establishing the order of the army.\nScouts sent out on 18 December reported the royal army had crossed the Eure and would be on the flank of the intended march for 19 December. This turned out to be a false alarm. Condé and Coligny again came into disagreement, the former expecting battle while the latter felt that the royal army wouldn't dare give battle with their cavalry inferiority. They began a march towards Tréon, but without leaving scouts on the river crossing. By this means it was only at 10am that they became aware the royal army was drawn up on the planned right flank of their march.\n\n\n==== Royal march ====\nThe royal army departed Paris on 11 December, numbering around 19,000 men. Due to the cavalry inferiority, they took a northern route out of Paris, relying on bad roads and poor country to allow their infantry to grant them safety. For a while Guise was established at Poissy as the royal army shadowed that of the Protestants. Once it became clear that the Protestants were heading into Normandie, word was sent to Paris that battle might be given in the next 4/5 days. The Constable, Saint-André and Guise were keen to gain royal permission for open battle with fellow Frenchman. According to Castelnau Catherine sarcastically noted that such experienced captains were asking the opinions of a woman and a child. More formally in royal council the next day it was established that battle would be at the commanders discretion to give.\nThe royal army was forced to halt at Mézières on 18 December both due to an illness Montmorency was experiencing and due to the late hour in the day making a crossing inadvisable. The army sent some scouts across the river, which were observed by the Protestant army, causing a false panic that the royal army had crossed the Eure. Having rested, the royal army began crossing the Eure around midnight and the entire army was across the river before dawn. A line was established between the villages of Nuisement and Le Lucate. Soon the royal scouts reported that the sound of Protestant drummers could be heard near Imberdais to the south.\nSaint-André, Guise and Montmorency therefore held council and it was agreed that it would be necessary to force the Protestants to give battle by blocking their line of march. The baggage was left at Nuisement and the army advanced southwards to positions anchored on the villages of Épinay and Blainville.\n\n\n==== Drawing up ====\n\nNow realising their situation, the Protestants formed up into a line in front of Imberdais. D'Andelot was dispatched to report on the royal positions, and reported back they were too strong to attack, with the royalists outnumbering them. D'Andelot advised that they withdraw to Tréon. The two armies stood opposite one another for two hours. During this long wait the leaders of both sides could consider with horror the number of their friends and relatives in the opposing armies ranks. The Constable was directly across the field from his nephews, meanwhile the Protestant writer La Noue noted that he was opposite a dozen of his friends. Coligny convinced Condé that the royalists would not give battle, and that they should continue their march. Therefore, the Protestant advance guard began to disengage from the line and begin progress towards Tréon. However some reiters and light cavalry screening the advance guard's march were subject to artillery fire from a battery of 14 guns and scattered. Condé thus determined it was not safe to disengage and recalled the advance guard to form back up in the line.\nThe royal army totalled around 14,000 infantry with 2,000 cavalry (of which roughly half were German mercenaries). They had also brought 22 artillery pieces. On the royal armies right flank at Épinay were the advanced guard led by Saint-André and Guise: Spanish infantry to the extreme right, then Guise's gendarmes (200 strong with an almost equal number of volunteers), then French infantry under the vicomte de Martigues, then cavalry under Saint-André, then German landsknecht, then Damville and Aumale's gendarme companies. The advance guard was at least nominally under Saint-André's authority, with Guise only responsible for his gendarmes, however Carroll argues he had de facto control of the whole wing with Saint-André deferring to him in strategic matters. Alongside Aumale, Guise's other brothers the marquis d'Elbeuf and the grand prieur were also among the royal ranks. The main battle followed under Montmorency's command, first the Swiss pikeman (the largest unit in the field), then more French infantry (Breton and Picard 'legions'), then light dragoon cavalry under the seigneur de Sansac finally on the armies extreme left was Montmorency with the rest of the gendarmerie. In front of the army were two artillery positions, one in front of the advanced guard (of 14 cannons) the other on the left flank of the Swiss (of 8 cannons). By integrating their cavalry with the infantry, the royal army hoped to overcome their inferiority in this aspect of the army.\nThe Protestant force numbered around 8,000 infantry, with 5,000 cavalry. Their army was arrayed in two lines with Condé in charge of the main battle on the left while Coligny commanded the advanced guard on the right. In the first line (which was solely cavalry) from left: on the extreme left two units of reiters, then Condé's gendarmerie, then two more gendarme regiments one behind the other, then a unit of light cavalry, then Coligny's gendarmes, finally on the armies extreme right, two more units of reiters. In total there were around 4,500 horse in army. In the second line the body was composed of French infantry, with two units of landsknechts on each side and a reserve unit of reiters on the far right. The Protestant artillery was in front of the French infantry.\n\n\n=== Dreux ===\n\nThe battle began with a charge of the Protestant cavalry into the royal left under Montmorency's command. The aggressive cavalry charges of the Protestants were necessitated by their comparative paucity in artillery. Condé's cavalry charged into the Swiss phalanx and succeeded in penetrating it, Coligny's cavalry meanwhile drove into the cavalry under Montmorency and succeeded in routing it, capturing Montmorency. After his capture, Montmorency was quickly hurried back to Orléans by with a guard of reiters on Coligny's orders for fear that he might escape.  Prior to his capture Montmorency had requested support from Guise as his position collapsed, but Guise declined to advance in support. Montmorency was wounded in the jaw during the fight. Montmorency's son the sieur de Montbéron was killed in the combat by an écuyer (squire) of the prince de Condé with whom he had recently quarrelled. Montbéron's brother Damville rode across to Guise and furiously demanded that he avenge the death. Guise assured him that while there would be a time for revenge, it was not at this moment. The royal Breton and Picard legions disintegrated, and the Protestant cavalry pursued the collapsing left wing back to the Eure. Only the Swiss remained on the field for the left, Damville and Aumale attempted to protect them only to be themselves routed by the Protestant reiters. Aumale was thrown from his horse and wounded in the shoulder.\nDuring this time the royal right was almost entirely inactive, except for a force under the baron de Biron which shielded those on the left who had rallied and protected the royal rear from being attacked from behind by Protestant cavalry.\nThe Protestant attack moved to focus on the Swiss, who were subject to a second attack by Protestant cavalry returning from the chase of the routed. One of the German landsknecht units attempted to engage the Swiss but were fiercely charged and fled back to the village of Blainville where they barricaded themselves in a courtyard. Fresh off this victory the Swiss attempted to recapture the royal artillery but were subjected to a new series of cavalry charges which broke them into small units, forcing the Swiss to retreat. Delighted the Protestant German reiters began to cry 'victory!' and make towards the royal baggage. This confounded Condé and Coligny who knew much of the royal army had yet to be committed but their cavalry was now dispersed across the field.\n\nWith their enemies cavalry scattered the royal right now acted, their advance at first swept the Protestants from the field. Some contemporaries alleged that Guise's late entry into the battle was a result either of cowardice or a desire to see his rivals for military command eliminated. Wood sees it as an example of 'modern generalship'. Gendarmes and the Spanish infantry attacked the French infantry. After some volleys of fire from the Spanish the rear of the infantry broke and the front was left to be slaughtered. The other landsknecht unit seeing what was unfolding retired from the field without engaging. The cavalry fought on, but Condé was at last forced to retreat into the woods to the east of the battlefield, during the retreat he was captured (his horse having been shot out from under him he was made the prisoner of the baron de Damville).\n\nWith the battle seemingly over, Guise went to Blainville to negotiate the surrender of the landsknechts who had barricaded themselves in the courtyard. However behind the woods Coligny was able to rally around 1,000 French and German cavalry into a new line and advanced through the woods to the royal positions. Upon their emergence it was initially thought these were more Protestants who wished to surrender. However once battle was joined it initially seemed possible that the Protestants could triumph. Marshal de Saint-André was captured by a former servant of his named the sieur de Bobigny who had years previous killed another of Saint-André's servants. Saint-André had attempted to prosecute Bobigny for this crime, and had hung an effigy of the noble after his flight, also seeing to the seizure of his property. Bobigny refused to turn his prize over to his commanding officer the prince de Porcien, who consented to Bobigny maintaining Saint-André's ransom. Bobigny then shot Saint-André in the face. Guise however had wisely kept more reserves and ordered the veteran infantry under Martigues to engage at the decisive moment. They formed a square south of Blainville and brutalised the approaching cavalry (which had already used its lances for the destruction of the Swiss) with arquebus fire. Unable to break the formation, Coligny ordered a retreat from the field. He was briefly pursued, but only for a few minutes.\n\n\n==== Aftermath of battle ====\n\nIt was initially reported that the Protestant forces had won the battle and that Montmorency and Guise were dead, however soon accurate word of what had transpired spread. Catherine and her sons travelled to Paris on 22 December where they heard Te Deum's in celebration of the victory. Twenty two of Condé's standards were transported for display in Notre-Dame. L'Hôpital took a different view of the battlefield victory, seeing it as a source of embitterment among the defeated, who would return to their places of refuge only further inflamed. Protestantism could not be defeated on the battlefield for the chancellor.\nIn the days following the battle both Coligny and the English ambassador would write to Elizabeth that while they had by conventional metrics lost the battle, in terms of the loss of noble gentleman of note, they had in fact triumphed. Coligny further argued that he had withdrawn from the field in good order and had in fact returned to the field the next day to give battle again only to be denied. While characterising the letters as damage control, Wood agrees with this assessment as regards noble casualties, and highlights how poorly the royalist cavalry had been handled during the battle. Of the seven tactical units the royal cavalry had been divided into six were either routed from the field or mauled. 7 of the 36 gendarme companies who participated in the battle for the royalist side were either killed on the field or fatally wounded, with another 4/5 seriously wounded or captured.  In terms of high-profile Protestant noble casualties, La Rochefoucauld was seriously wounded during the combat.\nFor the Protestants their infantry was devastated, with at least half of it casualties. The mercenary forces of d'Andelot surrendered without fighting. 1,500 of the German mercenaries were dispatched back to the Empire, while the remainder were incorporated into the royal army. Despite being defeated, the Protestants managed to inflict close to equal casualty numbers on the significantly numerically superior force. According to Carroll of the 8,000 casualties 2/3 of them were royalist. The royalists had lost around 500 nobles. Of the royal Swiss there were around 1,000 casualties including their colonel and most of their officers. Wood argues that at a conservative estimate there were 6,000 dead, he also notes that there were few survivors who were seriously wounded as most who fit this description succumbed to the cold of the winter night.\nColigny retreated with the remainder of the Protestant forces first to Auneau (where they rendezvoused with the surviving infantry) and then to the safety of the rebel headquarters at Orléans where the surviving infantry from the battle were to serve as a garrison. Before arriving at Orléans he oversaw the capture of a couple of towns on the Cher river. He was able to maintain good order among the forces he took from the field, though he lacked much in the way of surviving infantry and thus was compelled to look to recruit more. The royal army was too battered by the battle to attempt a pursuit of his force.\nThe soldier who had captured the Constable was compensated with 6,000 écus for his feat. In Orléans, Montmorency was lodged with the princesse de Condé who tended to his needs attentively.\nThe captive Condé was treated with great courtesy by the victorious Guise. He shared Guise's dinner table and even Guise's bed. This gentlemanly conduct was both an artefact of noble ethics and designed with the hope of detaching his enemy from the cause of Protestantism. Guise also hoped both to bolster his reputation for gentlemanly conduct and overwhelm the prince with his generosity. After the departure of Guise, Condé fell under the guard of Damville who maintained him at the abbey of Saint-Pierre near Chartres. In January he was moved to Paris. Condé wrote to a Norman pastor from his captivity that he believed himself to have been chosen by god to represent the Protestant cause.\nHaving taken a meal with the captive English ambassador, several chevaliers de l'Ordre de Saint-Michel (knights of the Order of Saint-Michel, the lieutenant-general and governor of Bretagne, Guise retired with the latter to discuss 'important matters'. The next day the English ambassador was summoned to convey a message devised by the two grandees. Étampes was able to take advantage of the absence of the other Triumvirs, and the strength of Breton soldiers in the royal army to insert himself into the centre of royal decision making.\nIn January the court issued an official protest against the entry into the kingdom of Protestant mercenaries from the Holy Roman Empire in favour of the domestic rebels. Among the signatories were the duc d'Orléans, the young king of Navarre and the cardinal de Bourbon. The king also declared again that neither he or his mother were captives, thus Protestant declarations to this effect were lies.\n\n\n=== Finishing touches ===\nOn 18 January the secrétaire d'État Bourdin was tasked by Guise with undertaking a military mission. He was to see that the German soldiers that had been with the Protestants under the commanders Grombach and Rocandolf capitulated.\nThe duc de Guise was chosen to replace the recently deceased duc de Nevers as governor of Champagne. Nevers had died as a result of wounds sustained at the battle of Dreux. As reported by the Histoire Ecclésiastique he was killed mistakenly by his subordinate officer des Bordes with whom he had collaborated at Troyes. He was succeeded in the Nevers line by his brother Jacques who was left with ruinous debts. Upon assumption of the governate of Champagne Guise resigned that of Dauphiné, which had lost its strategic importance now there was peace with Savoia. Though Guise hoped that by the rights of his victory he would get to choose the next marshal of France to replace Saint-André he was informed by the king that the crown had already selected the seigneur de Vielleville to fill his office. Three days after the battle of Dreux, Guise was made lieutenant-general of the kingdom. This was a confirmation by the crown of the unofficial acclamation he had received from his troops. Guise took responsibility for replacing the deceased gendarme company captains, supplementing those companies that had become depleted and creating captains for the new gendarme companies. In total he authorised the establishment 17 new companies. He was careful to reward not only his clients in the process. The lieutenant general of Languedoc, Joyeuse; lieutenant-general of Dauphiné, Maugiron; the senior lieutenant-general of Bretagne, Martigues; the son of Marshal Brissac and the future marshals  the baron de Biron and the seigneur de Gonnor were all rewarded in this effort with either captaincies if they did not possess them or supplements to their companies.\n\n\n=== Coligny's Normandie campaign ===\nFor a time Coligny considered uniting with the Protestant forces in Dauphiné, but the prospect of further royalist reinforcements from the Empire led to him to dismiss this idea. Therefore, Coligny left Orléans in the hands of his brother d'Andelot and departed north into Normandie. The infantry that he had taken off the field of Dreux remained with d'Andelot, while his force for the march north was largely composed of cavalry. Along with Coligny went La Rochefoucauld and de Bèze as well as around 2000 reiters, 500 men-at-arms 500 mounted arquebusiers and further horses for the supplies. This force made quick progress covering 50 leagues in 6 days. While initially in control of his force by the time he made camp at Dives his troops were tearing apart the countryside. Once in Normandie he began besieging and capturing towns from the royalists. He successfully took Elbeuf, Bayeux, Saint-Lô, Avranches and Vire. He aimed to unify his forces with those under Montgommery and the English.\nAs he campaigned he operated in persistent fear that his German mercenaries would abandon him for want of pay. His troops indeed became more mutinous as time passed, with the mercenaries aggressively raiding the countryside. Coligny resolved to go up to the coast to rendezvous with the English. Elizabeth's agents on the continent echoed Coligny's pleas for money. On 20 January Elizabeth wrote him a letter in which she announced that she would happily assist in the payment of his army or provision of men during the captivity of Condé, but only to a degree which was tolerable to the English state. In late February, Coligny and his rampaging mercenaries moved into west Normandie where they continued to devastate villages regardless of their religious affiliation. Coligny received word that he was to receive financial relief from England to the sum of 8,000 crowns. The English ambassador met with him at Caen on 28 February and informed him that in return for receipt of the money, Elizabeth insisted on his compliance with the entirety of the terms of the Treaty of Hampton Court. He was further informed that if he was entirely reliant on England, the English queen desired him to seek a negotiated settlement as it was not in her interest to support him. He was to insist on the provision of Calais to England in such a settlement. Coligny in turn informed the English ambassador that if he did not receive the money soon he was at risk of having his throat cut by his troops. The first payment would arrive while he was beneath the walls of Caen.  On 1 March he put the château de Caen under siege and the marquis d'Elbeuf who was held up inside surrendered the fortification the following day. Elbeuf, the governor of Caen and the garrison were allowed to depart with weapons and supplies in return for their surrender. He followed this up with the capture of Bayeux, which was undertaken by the sieur de Colombières the town subdued by his four cannons. Bayeux was subject to a sack, with the priests and tax collectors of the town summarily executed. The ProtestantHistoire Ecclésiastique denounced the rapacity of the tax collectors as a just reason for their death.\nAfter Bayeux, he oversaw the capture of Saint-Lô, Avranches and Vire; then Mortagne, L'Aigle, Falaise, Argentan and Bernay. La Meilleraye led the conquest of Honfleur while Montgommery took charge of the capture of Saint-Lô, Avranches and Vire. Confronted by a force of peasants near Bernay, Coligny's mercenaries easily bested them.\n\n\n=== Siege of Orléans ===\n\nGuise returned to the campaign after a brief pause, capturing first Étampes and Pithiviers back from the Protestant rebels. A little while later he had brought all the towns of Beauce back into the royal fold. Then establishing himself at Beaugency he made plans for an advance towards Orléans. By this time Orléans was one of two major cities in northern France still in rebel hands alongside Le Havre. Guise saw to the raising of new captains, and the establishment of fresh units of heavy cavalry. By now pay for the royal army was coming into serious arrears and he worked towards the resolution of this.\nGuise crossed the Loire and approached Orléans. His crossing coincided with that of Coligny who was marching the other way and his forces came out the worse in the 'collision' at Cléry on 13 January. He resolved to conduct a siege of the city, and arrived in front of the walls on 22 January. Misfortune for the royalist cause struck at this time with the due to the recent detonation of the powder reserves of Paris, Chartres and Châteaudun. Powder therefore had to be sourced from Spanish Nederland. Further complications came from the weather, which Guise bemoaned the poor quality of in letters to the German mercenary commander. By 5 February he had invested the city and captured the faubourg du Portereau. Guise complained to the seigneur de Gonnor on 7 February that if he only had six cannon and two thousand rounds he could have the city brought into submission. With the fall of Portereau, Guise turned his attention to two large towers which controlled passage onto the bridge across the river to the main city. A few days later he was able to capture the two towers. He placed his artillery in these towers so that he might cannonade the city proper.\nThis accomplished, Guise looked for reinforcements to bolster his position, and while they arrived looked to capture the islands in the Loire between the north and south parts of Orléans. The island of 'Les Mottes' was well defended and its capture would prove difficult for Guise without his heavy artillery train.\nThe seigneur de Duras who had been defeated in the battle of Vergt was killed while at Orléans.\nDe Laubespine was acutely aware that the kingdoms financial situation was increasingly dire, and wrote to Gonnor asking him to make it clear to Guise the weak financial situation of the crown. Catherine by this point was desirous of establishing a negotiated settlement, however militant Catholic opinion was adverse to this prospect. She further wished to ensure that Guise would not have Orléans sacked. On 5 February the municipal authorities of Paris implored Catherine to impress upon the Protestants that there could only be one religion in France. The English ambassador reported that the Parisian opposition to peace was one of the three major roadblocks to a successful negotiated settlement. In response to this militancy, Catherine urged Marshal Montmorency to station more troops in the capital.\nDue to the poor financial situation, Alluye was unable to secure the sending of the troops under Nemours' command to join with Guise on the siege lines of Orléans, despite the fact that they were much needed. Nemours' soldiers were beginning to starve for lack of funds for food.\n\n\n=== Assassination of the duc de Guise ===\n\nOn 18 February the duc de Guise was returning from an inspection of the siege camp in the suburb of Portereau, where sappers were at work. Many of the thirty artillery pieces he had been waiting for had now arrived putting him in a far more advantageous position. He was ready to conduct the final assault of the city on the following day. On the return to his camp he was travelling with Tristan de Rostaing away from the majority of his men who were further ahead. He was ambushed and fatally wounded by the Protestant Jean de Poltrot. Poltrot had been in the service of the Protestant commander the sieur de Soubise serving as a messenger between Lyon and the Parc Soubise. Guise was hurried back to his lodgings while Poltrot de Méré attempted to flee.  Poltrot de Méré would not succeed and confessed to a soldier who arrested him on suspicion. As he weakened, Guise forgave his killer, and according to his relatives spent his final days in a chivalric and Christians fashion. He confessed to his chaplain and received extreme unction from the papal legate the cardinal d'Este. He is supposed to have declared that he would be saved not through his good works but rather the grace of god and that he considered Condé a friend and good relative who was a victim of the Châtillon family. Further he apologised for Wassy, though not due to his responsibility, but rather because blood was shed. In his final moments, his more conservative Catholic relatives the cardinal de Guise and duc d'Aumale worked to ensure there would be no accusations of Lutheranism as there had been with Navarre's final hours. A conservative Catholic confessor (the bishop of Riez) was chosen, who reported that his final moments were suitably Roman Catholic. Riez was accused of meddling with Guise's words and downplaying Guise's apology for Wassy in his version of the ducs final moments. According to the bishop of Riez Guise enjoyed listening to the Epistle of Saint James, an Epistle that had been condemned by Luther. The duc de Guise died on 24 February. Command of the siege was taken up by the duc d'Étampes and the Marshal de Bourdillon. Étampes quickly entered talks with the Protestants of Orléans towards the release of Montmorency.\nThe captured assassin was subject to interrogations beginning on 21 February when he was brought before Catherine and the royal council at Saint-Hilaire. He confessed that he had been presented by Soubise to Coligny in Orléans and that Coligny had asked him to kill Guise. He informed his interrogators that he refused the request initially, with Coligny swearing him to silence. He then departed to Lyon and it was only on his return in December to Orléans that Coligny, this time with de Bèze, worked on him again and he agreed to the scheme. In return for his participation he was to receive 20 écus, which was a very small sum, Coligny also informed him he was one of only '50 men' involved in the enterprise, with the other participants to execute 'similar deeds' (Poltrot noted that Montpensier and Sansac were particularly despised). Poltrot alleged that after ingratiating himself in Guise's entourage, he returned to the Protestant camp to protest that Guise was always well guarded. Coligny and de Bèze again got him to commit, and forwarded him a further 100 écus to buy a better horse for his escape.  He added that La Rochefoucauld may have been involved, but that Condé, Andelot and Soubise were innocent. These confessions were extracted under torture. They also varied interrogation to interrogation, with the assassin retracting his accusations in a second confession before re-making them in a third.\nBy contrast, an anonymous account states that Coligny had a would be assassin of the duc de Guise put to death at Rouen.\nThe Lorraine family (chief among them, the late ducs widow the duchesse de Guise) believed in the involvement of Coligny in the killing, and this began a vendetta between the families. This vendetta would culminate ten years later in the assassination of Admiral Coligny. Coligny was not shy that he viewed the assassination as a positive thing, and wrote to Catherine expressing his satisfaction at the deed, though assuring her that it was not he who had ordered it. In defence of himself he added that while he of course abhorred the assassination, that he was aware of similar conspiracies that targeted himself and Condé, and had presented proof of these to Catherine and Montmorency. After 'attempts by Guise and Saint-André to see Condé assassinated' Coligny claimed he had ceased to bother to dissuade those who came to him with assassination plots, while not actively encouraging them. In a document drawn up on 22 March at Caen, Coligny went through the testimony of the assassin point by point offering a refutation for each section. He stated that if he had wanted to assassinate Guise he would not have given the job to Poltrot de Méré, that the money he gave him was to spy on the duc and buy a horse, that he interpreted Poltrot's expressed desire to assassinate the duc as bravado. He further included an argument that the language of the testimony was inconsistent with that of a Protestant. Particularly he highlighted that throughout the deposition he was referred to as the 'seigneur de Châtillon', a name that was only used 'by his enemies'. He requested that Poltrot be well guarded and kept like this, such that a proper investigation could be conducted. Those around him in Caen were nervous the frank nature of his approach to the affair might not play to his advantage politically. Soubise though not specifically accused petitioned the king to have him formally declared innocent with no right of appeal or re-opening an investigation into him. De Bèze protested that he had never met Poltrot de Méré and as regarded the duc de Guise he had hoped to see him brought to justice for Wassy and had prayed god to either induce a change of heart in the noble or deliver the kingdom some other way.\nCatherine was also relieved to be free of Guise, remarking to Condé in March, that just as she had released Condé, so had she been released by the death of the duc. Sutherland notes that according to three of the ambassadors (Spanish, Papal and English) at the French court Condé inquired in the days prior to the assassination as to whether Guise was injured or dead.\nMany Protestants celebrated Poltrot de Méré's deeds, some in verse. According to some he was an agent of gods will, a David who slayed Goliath. The assassination had undoubtedly preserved Orléans from falling to the royal army, and therefore he was lauded as a tyrannicide who had liberated the city just as did Judith when she slayed Holofernes.\nParis reacted with horror to the assassination of the duc de Guise. Catherine conscious that the capital might react explosively wrote to the Parisian authorities urging them to make sure there was no rioting. The grief at the death of their hero was compounded by word that Catherine was using the opportunity to negotiate a peace 'disadvantageous to the Catholic church'. A Catholic crowd seized a woman being taken to prison, killing her and then dragging her body through the city. The guard was increased across the city to stop further attacks and murders.\n\nOn 18 March, the day before the peace of Amboise was declared, Poltrot de Méré was executed in Paris before a large crowd. His end was brutal, and his limbs were put before each gate of the city, with his body burned to ashes in the place de Grève. This was followed a day later by an elaborate funeral procession for the late duc de Guise. The procession featured many militiamen wielding arquebuses, nobles, clerics and various bourgeois Parisians. Jean de La Fosse estimated there was over 10,000 participants in the funeral. This differentiated it from other princely funerals of the century which did not enjoy such bourgeois participation.\nFor Catherine, the death of Guise was a blessing, as she was provided room of her own to manoeuvre politically. The Guise were destroyed as a political force, with the late ducs young son, the prince de Joinville only 13 years old. Joinville was established as the new governor of Champagne, though during the boys minority the charge would be exercised by his uncle the duc d'Aumale.\n\n\n=== Final negotiations ===\nCatherine resolved to bring about peace, and to this end Condé and Montmorency were released from their respective captivities so that they might negotiate. Their negotiations began on 6 March and they were accompanied by the royal secrétaire de Laubespine, d'Andelot, the Protestant governor of Orléans Saint-Cyr and his subordinate Jean d'Aubigné, and Montmorency's second son the baron de Damville. Montmorency was old, and Condé was keen to return to court. Condé initially moved for the re-establishment of the Edict of Saint-Germain but this was unacceptable to Montmorency's sensibilities. They therefore quickly reached agreement which was signed by the parties on 13 March on the Île aux Bœufs \n\n\n== Peace ==\n\n\n=== Edict of Amboise ===\n\nOn 19 March 1563 the Edict of Amboise brought the war to a close. By its terms all Protestants enjoyed freedom of conscience. Protestant nobleman with the rights of high justice to their lands could worship freely on their estates. Those nobles without rights of high justice could worship in their homes. Beyond this Protestantism was permitted in towns the religion controlled before 7 March 1562 and in one town in each baillage (bailiwick). The church must be located in a suburb though, not in the town proper. Protestantism was prohibited in the vicomté de Paris, though Protestants could live in the area. All property seized from the Catholic church was to be returned. The leading rebels, such at the Châtillon brothers, were restored to the offices they had enjoyed prior to the war. While most crimes such as murder and pillage committed during the war were to be amnestied exceptions for the killing of children and sexual violence were made. The parlement of Paris baulked at registering the edict, as it had the Edict of January the preceding year. Cardinal de Bourbon and the duc de Montpensier were jointly despatched to compel the parlement to register the edict. On 27 March the parlement agreed to register the edict, though not to publish it. In a calculated rebuke to the parlements dignity, Catherine therefore chose to declare the young king's majority in the parlement of Rouen.  Town criers who announced the peace were pelted with mud.\nSutherland contrasts the edict of Amboise with that of Saint-Germain. The former she argues was a permissive edict, that allowed Protestant worship without establishing administrative or judicial apparatus for ensuring its application or any military guarantees to the Protestants or any rights to possess offices. By contrast Amboise afforded an institutional position for Protestantism. Christin adds that the possibility of urban bi-confessionalism was opened for the first time with Amboise, something that had been precluded in the edict of Saint-Germain. Further the judiciary was not only allowed to be Protestant but its right to be so was advocated for by the king.\nThe parlement of Dijon likewise refused to register the edict. A delegation was sent to the capital to protest its terms. At the instigation of the lieutenant-general Tavannes, the parlementaire Jean Bégat drew up a critique of the edict. Bégat's criticism was delivered to represent the general Burgundian opposition to the terms. It argued that a state could not take half measures in matters of religion, and that one was either with Christ or against him. Bégat raised the spectre of the possibility of France becoming a 'new Germania' where everyone would elect their own ministers. Christin argues that rather than quieting the anti-Protestant policy of the city government, parlement and lieutenant-general the peace in fact emboldened them as they turned to legal quibbling and judicial attacks. Under great duress the parlement registered the edict on 19 June 1563, but only with a clause that negated the edicts terms added to the text. It would require the personal presence of the king in May 1564 during the grand tour of the kingdom for the parlement to register the edict in its intended form.\nBeneath the parlement of Dijon the sénéchaussée of Mâcon hesitated before registering the edict, apprehensive that it was not really the king's intention to establish such a peace.\nThe premier président (first president) of the Bordeaux parlement Jacques-Benoît Lagebâton managed to push the registration of the edict through the body over the objections of his colleagues. As a reward for this, the other judges were able to hound him from office some time later. The parlementaires resisted the crowns choice of commissioners for Guyenne several weeks.\nInstead of registering the edict, the parlement of Aix re-established its commitment to the declaration of 1562 that Catholicism was the only religion of the kingdom. The body refused to acknowledge they had received the new peace edict for a year. In response, the royal government dismissed the entire body of justices and replaced them for a year. Ultimately however Provence would be excluded from the need to provide sites of worship to the Protestants of the province.\nThe baron de Caylus was entrusted by the court with heading to Toulouse to ensure their parlement registered the edict. He arrived in the city for the registration of the edict on 14 April and then set about working towards its enforcement, receiving the submission of the comte de Crussol and with him the Protestant strongholds that had held out. It would not be until the arrival of the new governor of Languedoc the baron de Damville on 21 July that the edict would be registered. Nevertheless, the parlement refused to either print or display the edict on the grounds it would cause disorder among the Catholic population in reaction to its terms.\nThe baron de Damville declared in December that as a frontier province, the edict did not apply to Languedoc.\nIn some Catholic communities, such as Troyes, Protestant prisoners were hurriedly executed before the terms of the treaty could come into force. Many Catholics resented the return of Protestants to the communities they had expelled them from, while Protestants resented the restrictions on their worship.\nIn Le Mans the peace did not bring an end to the harassment and brutalisation of the communities Protestants. In Tours it was only after great effort that the Protestant officers of the présidial court were restored to their offices over the objections of the échevins (alderman) and clerics in December.\nIn Saintonge by contrast the return of Catholicism with peace was only a clandestine one and the syndic of the clergy of Saintes remarked that there were 95 dioceses where there was no practice of the Roman religion and the holders of the benefice dare not reside. In communities such as Montauban, it was only with the arrival of the crowns commissioners in 1564 that Catholic worship was restored.\nSimilarly in Dieppe, some Protestants argued against the return of Catholics with the peace. They petitioned to receive a Protestant captain, so that their obedience would come more easily. A request was made of Condé on 20 April to provide a governor who was at least sympathetic to Protestantism.\nThe peace was greatly advantageous to the Protestant nobility at the expense of the broader Protestant community. Condé was rebuked for the terms he had agreed to by both Coligny and the Genevan pastors. Christin argues the Protestant charges that the peace offered less than did Saint-Germain was in part intended as a direct attack on Condé. Jean Calvin himself denounced Condé as a 'wretched man' who had betrayed god for his personal vanity. Coligny charged Condé with having damaged the Protestant church to a greater degree than the faiths enemies could have done in ten years. Condé reassured Coligny that once he was lieutenant-general of the kingdom he would push Catherine for more concessions. The peace established Protestantism as a religion of the high nobility, as it was high nobles who could enjoy the freest practice of the faith, this damaged its ability to attract new converts. A contemporary Protestant pamphlet bemoaned that the remedy of toleration was now restricted to only small parts of the body, while the evil was across the whole. Only complete religious freedom across the kingdom could save France from the problems tearing it apart.\n\n\n=== Lyon ===\nThe Protestant governor of Lyon, the baron de Soubise, refused to recognise the edict of Amboise. Writing to Calvin he expressed his discontent at the terms of the edict, with Calvin responding that he should look to the example of Crussol and Châtillon. He therefore continued resisting until 15 June. During this time (on 11 June) a radical pamphlet was published in the city which argued that private individuals had the right to kill tyrants. This pamphlet was too radical for Soubise and he had all copies of it burned, while the Protestant pastor Pierre Viret denounced it.\nOn 11 June, marshal Vielleville had the edict of Amboise registered by the sénéchaussée of Lyon on 11 June. Mass would be celebrated in Lyon for the first time in fifteen months on 4 July.\n\n\n=== Crussol's disarmament ===\nIn the southern provinces under the authority of the Protestant comte de Crussol, the commander attempted to see that his co-religionists adhere to the edict.\nRoyal letters were sent in March to the lieutenant-generals of Dauphiné and Languedoc (Maugiron and Joyeuse) in the former and latter respectively) ordering them to see that the Protestants disarm before they disarm in turn. Crussol wrote back to the crown protesting that it was impossible to come to accord with Joyeuse due to the hatred that was felt for him in Languedoc. If Crussol handed over towns to the lieutenant-general he suspected Joyeuse would be unable to hold them. He requested that the crown dispatch a grandee to replace him.\nIn May new orders came for Crussol's disarmament from the court, the orders being sent to Maugiron, Joyeuse and the Papal commander Serbelloni alongside him. The crown requested the handing over of the revenues that Crussol had requested and further announced the imminent arrival of Marshal Vielleville to enforce the peace in the Midi. Vielleville was charged with the pacification formally on 8 May.\n\n\n==== Languedoc ====\nIn Languedoc Crussol continued to be involved in military operations, responding to a request from his lieutenant in the Gévaudan for support against the sieges of Catholic lords by dispatching forces from the Vivarais, Gévaudan and Cévennes to the area. Crussol's brother alongside other commanders lifted the sieges.\nJoyeuse and Crussol continued to wrangle with one another. Joyeuse protesting that he had seen the edict adopted in the territories he controlled, while Caylus had been forced to take on that role in the Protestant towns. He further charged Crussol with continuing to reinforce his soldiery and his towns, alongside the continued raising of revenues. The crown was informed continued Protestant aggression necessitated the maintenance of troops at Aigues-Mortes and Narbonne which were being menaced. Soon after this Crussol reached out to Joyeuse proposing a list of towns from which they could both withdraw their forces. He followed this by sending the cardinal de Châtillon to Joyeuse with an offer of simultaneous mutual standing down. By this means the province could be handed over to Vielleville (Nicoll notes that this represented his abhorrence of the notion of providing it to Joyeuse). Joyeuse retorted that his lieutenants were in good obedience to him in applying the peace, but that he could not fully disarm while there were such Protestant forces around Avignon and being maintained by the Montpellier estates, or while Protestants continued to exploit Catholic churches. The Nîmois Protestants oversaw the destruction of the cathedral and several churches in May and the subsequent months. The spat between the two continued over subsequent exchanges, with Crussol emphasising that he would hand over his towns to Vielleville, not Joyeuse.\nAnother assembly was convened at Montpellier in May at which Crussol attempted to convince the Protestants of the necessity of accepting the peace. Crussol arrived alongside the cardinal de Châtillon and the comte de Caylus who had been dispatched by the crown to see to the pacification of the Protestants in Languedoc. He was supported in this by the Protestant nobles, who had united with Condé's position. The more modest delegates were less keen on the peace. During the assembly, Caylus announced that he had seen the peace published in Toulouse, Narbonne, Carcassonne and Castelnaudary. Crussol read out a royal letter in favour of the peace. After a discussion it was agreed to publish the edict on 13 May. Having approved the publication of the peace, the delegates requested that the peace be enforced on the Catholics also, highlighting 'many great evils' they had perpetrated since its publishing in Toulouse. They further requested the replacement of the lieutenant-general Joyeuse with a prince du sang due to Joyeuse having 'introduced the Spanish into the kingdom'. The assembly decided to grant Crussol 10 gentleman to accompany him to court when he made the trip, a sign of their approval of his performance as leader. It was further requested that he continue on in his role until peace was firmly established. The body sought to investigate those who used the coming of peace as a reason to not pay the rents they owed for the Catholic ecclesiastical land they were using. The use of force to compel payments was considered an option.\nBy June, Crussol reported that the sum of money he was to hand over to the crown was no longer recoverable as the people of Languedoc did not wish to hand it over given Joyeuse's behaviour. His failure to hand over the gabelle (salt tax) revenue was a result of the crown's agent not appearing to receive it. Catherine wrote to him disapprovingly on this matter, noting that now that the realm was at peace, all the money he had raised via his estates belonged to the crown. She further highlighted that she had been informed military reinforcements continued to be undertaken in Protestant held places and asked Crussol to clarify this. In late June, Crussol wrote back informing her that Protestants were not impeding the collections of harvests or chasing them from territories. By contrast he noted that in Toulouse a Catholic confession of faith was required. If Vielleville could not arrive in Languedoc, Crussol suggested he would favour handing over the towns to Caylus over Joyeuse. According to the financial records, Crussol was speaking truthfully abuot his disbanding of troops in May and June.\nOn 6 July Crussol surrendered control of his towns in Languedoc to Vielleville and Caylus at Valence.\n\n\n==== Comtat Venaissin ====\nIn response to a plea for reinforcements from Orange, Crussol saw to the levying of more companies in Provence. Orange further requested the ability to raise revenues through the selling of Catholic assets  and benefices. After a discussion with his lieutenant in the Comtat Venaissin the seigneur de Saint-Auban, Crussol assented to the consuls of Orange taking this step.\nMeanwhile, Condé asked Crussol to return the Papal territories to their former master. Crussol wrote back a protest to the prince informing him that he could not provide them back to the Papacy. Crussol highlighted the expenses incurred in the territory that required reimbursement, that the Pope was no friend of Crussol or Condé, that freedom of Protestant worship would not be guaranteed, and the requests he was receiving from the people of the Comtat Venaissin. Subsequently, Crussol entered negotiations with Serbelloni offering the return of the territories if freedom of religion and the compensation of his expenses was provided. In reply the destruction of Avignon was compared favourably to the allowance of Protestantism in the territory.\nIn early May, the Protestant forces in the Comtat Venaissin captured further settlements in the region. They also continued the levying of soldiers. The estates of Avignon protested to Crussol and the comte de Sault against this and levied troops in response. Calls were sent out to Serbelloni and Sommerive to this effect. Sommerive thus protested to the crown that while he would like to disband, Avignon had great need of soldiers. On 31 May Crussol declared that the king's will that the fighting in the Comtat Venaissin cease was known to him, but that the Provençal troops in the province were not under his authority. Nevertheless, he ordered all these troops to stand down and depart from the Comtat Venaissin.\nIn June, Crussol asserted that he no longer had any role to play in the Comtat Venaissin and could not be held responsible for Protestant disobedience in the region. He reminded the crown of the indignities he had suffered in the province including the death of his brother. According to Crussol, injustices continued under the regime of Serbelloni, with the French at the mercy of the Papal commanders and their soldiers. The subordinate he had placed in authority over the region stated on 8 June that he would undertakw no further operations but that maintain his presence in the region at the request of 53 walled Protestant communities that did not wish to be preyed on by Serbelloni. Several days later the Provençal soldiers sent a request to Crussol in which they protested that they entered the Comtat Venaissin in force only because they had been blocked from returning to their homes from the Lyonnais by 2,000 armed men, and they desired to continue their journey home. As both Crussol and Avignon refused them they therefore had no choice but to remain in the Papal territory.\nFinally at the end of August the Provençal troops were able to return to Provence.\n\n\n==== Dauphiné ====\nCrussol wrote to the towns of Dauphiné in April make known the peace and inform that an agent of the crown would be there soon to translate the royal will.\nCrussol protested frustratedly that in Dauphiné while he was seeing to the disarmament of his forces, Maugiron was still conducting pillage with companies such as that under the comte de Suze which was operating around Romans. According to Crussol those royal companies under Maugiron who were disbanded had subsequently reconvened and returned to hostilities. Towards the end of May, while still concerned at some of Maugiron's actions, Crussol expressed his satisfaction that Suze's company had disbanded. He ordered the disbanding of a company from Romans for his part.\nBy June Crussol reported to the crown that he was heading to Dauphiné to confer with Maugiron, informing Catherine that matters were mostly settled in the province. Vielleville arrived in Dauphiné at the start of July, his arrival much anticipated by the Protestants. They requested of the crown that Maugiron be replaced by their former lieurenant general the comte de Clermont\nAs late as August there were still troubles in Dauphiné.\n\n\n=== Provence ===\nViolence continued in Provence under the direction of Sommerive and Carcès to such an extent that in late 1563 Marshal Biron was dispatched to the province to deal with the situation. He brought with him 500 soldiers and two commissioners to provide backup. Biron led the reduction of the town of Sisteron which was still holding out for the Protestants. This accomplished he restored the comte de Tende as governor of Provence in Marseille and got the nobility of the province to recognise him. After some time in the area, he recommended in 1564 that Sommerive and Carcès be summoned to court to explain themselves.\n\n\n=== Guyenne ===\nIn Guyenne, Monluc maintained his correspondence with the Spanish, and bemoaned the recent peace for allowing Protestants to return to the royal court. He would even suggest to the Spanish king that he establish himself with the crown of France in the name of his wife Élisabeth.\n\n\n=== Removal of the reiters ===\nThe German mercenaries which had been brought into the kingdom for the fighting of the war proved to be difficult to remove. The secrétaire Bourdin wrote to Gonnor deploring the scourge which their presence caused the kingdom. It was to be the prince de Porcien who escorted the reiters from the kingdom. To some Catholics the choice of Porcien was met with disbelief due to his role in the very depredations that had afflicted their provinces in the previous year. The disparate mercenaries, which had been agglomerated into a single army, totalled between 10 and 12 thousand men. They departed from Orléans and entered Brie near Nangis around Easter. On route to leave the kingdom the reiters would pass by Châlons, and therefore the governor Bussy attempted again to enforce an expanded garrison upon the town. The council, as before, demurred causing Bussy to rage and then depart. He complained to the queen and the duc d'Aumale, who was acting as governor of the province during the minority of the duc de Guise. Aumale wrote a harsh letter to the council in which he excoriated them for their failures to show obedience to Bussy. It would not however be until Aumale himself imposed a garrison on the town that the issue was resolved in May. With Châlons passed, the force set up camp near Montier-en-Der where they would stay for a month and a half terrorising the countryside in hope of receiving payment. Bar-sur-Aube was sacked, the château of Blaye destroyed, and the monastery of Bracancourt torched, alongside general depredations of the countryside. The monks of Bracancourt fled to Chaumont. It was only with the large scale selling of church property in France (with Champagne alone selling off 500,000 livres worth) that they were paid off and departed.\n\n\n=== Recapture of Le Havre ===\nAlluye was despatched to treat with Elizabeth concerning Le Havre. Elizabeth informed him that she had not seized the city for any religious reason, but rather to avenge the wrong of the failure of the French to provide her Calais as stipulated by Cateau-Cambrésis. The French retorted that by seizing Le Havre and Dieppe, the English had voided any claim they had to the return of Calais. This in turn was rejoindered with a reminder of the French involvement in Scotland.\nOn 7 April Condé was established as lieutenant-general, and a few days later marshal Brissac moved north into Normandie with the siege guns that had been used for Orléans and a company of Swiss troops. The crown began raising revenues from Paris and the towns of France for the prosecution of the campaign against England. In Le Havre, Warwick's prepared for a siege, expelling all 'strangers' and constructing a trench in front of the town. The French began the siege on 22 May, with Catherine attending the operations personally even in the siege trenches.\nThe siege was a difficult one for the besiegers due to the marsh that was present around the fortification of Havre-de-Grace. Despite this, by the end of July they had advanced almost to the foot of the walls, able to attack them point-blank. The situation was not much better inside the city, which was racked by plague. The garrison was thus greatly reduced. During the siege the seigneur de Lévis (a brother of the comte de Crussol) was killed.\nOn 28 July 1563 Condé and Montmorency's army of Protestant and Catholic troops received the surrender of Warwick. He departed a few days later and the French army entered Le Havre on 1 August. By this means it was hoped to heal the wound to national pride, and to bring Catholics and Protestants together for a national project. Coligny and d'Andelot disapproved of the undertaking and refused to participate in the recapture of Le Havre. Peace was finally established with England by the treaty of Troyes in April 1564. By its terms Elizabeth ceded her claim to Calais, in return for 120,000 écus in compensation.\n\n\n=== Modifications of the peace ===\nThe edict of Amboise would not remain in the same form over the coming years. The declaration of Roussillon would reduce the favourability of the terms towards the Protestants.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nBabelon, Jean-Pierre (2009). Henri IV. Fayard.\nBaumgartner, Frederic (1986).

        "content": "The Murayama Domain (村岡藩, Murayama-han), was one of the feudal domains during the early Meiji period. It governed the Shichimi District in Tajima Province. The domain's administrative center was located at the Murayama jin'ya. The domain was established when Yamana Toyokuni, a descendant of the Yamana clan who had ruled over one-sixth of the country during the Muromachi period, was granted a fief of 6,700 koku in the Shichimi District by Tokugawa Ieyasu in recognition of his achievements in the Battle of Sekigahara. Subsequent lords of the domain worked to promote new land development and industrial growth, increasing the domain's wealth. In 1868, during the Meiji Restoration, the domain was officially recognized as a feudal domain with an increased income of 11,000 koku by the Meiji government.\n\n\n== History ==\nFollowing the Onin War, the Yamana clan rapidly declined, eventually only holding control over Tango Province and Inaba Province, split into two lineages during the late Sengoku period. Yamana Toyokuni, the elder brother of Toyokazu, maintained control over Inaba Province until he was forced to retreat from his base at Fuse Tenjinyama Castle due to an attack by Takeda Takanobu, the lord of Tottori Castle. The Inaba clan rapidly declined. Toyokuni, seeking to regain control over Inaba with the help of remnants of the Amago clan, expelled Takeda Takanobu from Tottori Castle and took over as the lord himself. However, when Hashiba Hideyoshi, acting on orders from Oda Nobunaga, invaded the San'in region, Toyokuni was the first to surrender, leading to his retainers abandoning him and expelling him from the castle. Toyokuni served Hideyoshi and became a member of the Otokoshu. After Hideyoshi's death, he approached Tokugawa Ieyasu. In the Battle of Sekigahara, he participated in the Eastern Army and achieved military merit. As a result of the words from Ieyasu, \"Please govern one county in Tango Province,\" he was given the 6,700 koku of Shichimi District in Tango Province. He built a residence in Usukusamura and changed the place name to Fukuoka. Although his landholding did not reach 10,000 koku, due to his lineage as a branch of the Nitta family, who were relatives of the Tokugawa Shogunate, he was considered exceptional even among hatamoto and later became one of the members of the Kōtaigōyūrei-shu. Toyokuni was a master of renga poetry and a cultured individual, as well as being from a prestigious family. Due to these qualities, he received favor from Ieyasu and made efforts to revive the Yamana clan by requesting the appointment of the fallen Yamana clan as hatamoto. Additionally, he heard that his former retainers who had been exiled were wandering, so he decided to reemploy them. However, perhaps due to his fickle nature, the later evaluations of Toyokuni were not favorable. In 1642, the third lord, Kiyoyuki, moved the administrative center to Kurono Village and changed its name to Murayama. The military records still referred to it as \"Tanshu Shizumi\" until the Kan'en era. The fifth lord, Toyonari, took charge of the temples and shrines. In 1806, the eighth lord, Yoshikata, relocated the administrative center to Obirayama and improved its appearance. Murayama had limited arable land, so the lords focused on developing industries like mining and holding calf markets. The tenth lord, Yoshitoki, was known for his efforts in developing new fields and promoting education. The eleventh lord, Yoshiyuki, became a loyalist on the advice of his retainer, Ikeda Keiichiro. In 1868, the new government recognized the increase in rice stipend, making the Yamana clan a daimyo and establishing the Murayama Domain. The following year, the han system was abolished, and it became part of Toyooka Prefecture. The last lord, Yoshimichi, inherited the family estate at the age of 12 in 1871 and later served as a lieutenant in the army. In 1884, he was ennobled as a baron and became a member of the House of Peers.\n\n\n== List of Daimyō ==\nMurayama Domain\n\nMuraoka Domain\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of han\nAbolition of the han system\nYamana clan\nTokugawa Shogunate\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Islamic fundamentalism in the Islamic Republic of Iran surged following the 1979 revolution, as the new theocratic regime embedded conservative Islamic principles into the state's governance and societal fabric.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter the Iranian Revolution of 1979, which saw the overthrow of the Shah and the establishment of an Islamic state, Iran experienced significant changes in its political, social, and religious landscape. The revolution was led by Ruhollah Khomeini, who became the country's Supreme Leader. The post-revolutionary state was characterized by Islamic fundamentalism, which refers to a movement towards returning to the original principles of Islam, interpreting them conservatively, and implementing them in all spheres of life. In Iran, this meant the implementation of Sharia law and the establishment of institutions based on Islamic principles.\nThe revolution had a profound impact on Iranian society. It led to the restructuring of the political system into a theocratic republic where ultimate authority is vested in a religious leader. This shift affected various aspects of life in Iran, including dress codes, social behaviors, and legal matters, aligning them with Islamic tenets.\n\n\n== Execution ==\nThe Islamic Revolution Committees, or Komiteh, were indeed one of the first institutions established after the 1979 Iranian Revolution. They functioned as a form of religious police, enforcing Islamic laws and social norms within the community. Komiteh, were instrumental in the rigorous enforcement of Islamic regulations within urban centers, ensuring adherence to prescribed dress codes, moral conduct, and social interactions. Concurrently, these committees were pivotal in quelling dissent and subduing counterrevolutionary factions and opposition groups that challenged the authority of Ayatollah Khomeini, thereby consolidating the theocratic governance structure. Following the decline of the Komiteh, the Gasht-e-Ershad, also known as the Morality Police, emerged as the primary institution enforcing Islamic regulations in the context of compulsory Hijab in the country. This organization took over the role of the Komiteh in monitoring public behavior and ensuring compliance with Islamic dress codes and moral standards. The Gasht-e-Ershad has been a significant presence in Iran, particularly in urban areas, where they have been known to patrol public spaces to enforce adherence to Islamic norms. Their activities have been a subject of controversy and have sparked protests and debates within Iran over the years.\nthe enforcement of Islamic principles extends beyond the Morality Police's focus on hijab compliance. Other aspects are managed by various institutions and laws.\nThe Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance in Iran is responsible for overseeing the nation's cultural policies and media regulation. It ensures that media content adheres to the government's legal standards and religious values, which includes monitoring internet content. The ministry also manages the licensing of cultural goods, including films, music, books, and art, to maintain consistency with national standards. Additionally, it aligns religious observances with legal requirements, contributing to the political dialogue, notably through the Friday Sermon. The ministry also aims to foster an understanding of so-called Iranian-Islamic culture while maintaining cultural sovereignty. Its wide-ranging authority influences Iran's cultural and ideological direction, in accordance with the principles established by the Islamic Revolution. In the context of educations in schools, the Ministry of Education ensures that curricula and teaching practices adhere to Islamic principles. This includes the mandatory teaching of the Quran and Islamic studies, as well as the enforcement of Islamic dress codes for both students and faculty. The language of instruction is Persian, and there are strict policies against the use of non-Persian languages in state schools, which has implications for Iran's ethnolinguistic minorities.\nWhen it comes to universities, the early years after the 1979 revolution were marked by the Cultural Revolution, which began in 1980. This period saw a significant overhaul of higher education, aimed at purging Western and non-Islamic influences from university campuses. Universities were closed for three years, and upon reopening, many books were banned, and thousands of students and lecturers were expelled or barred from returning. The goal was to “Islamize” the universities and ensure that they were in line with the revolutionary ideals. Since then, the state has maintained control over universities, with the Ministry of Science, Research, and Technology and the Ministry of Health and Medical Education overseeing higher education. These ministries regulate university curricula, faculty appointments, and student admissions, ensuring alignment with Islamic values.

        "content": "On September 27, 2022, 15-year-old Savannah Graziano and her 45-year-old father Anthony were shot and killed by deputies from the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department during a shootout in Hesperia, California. A day prior, Anthony Graziano had killed his estranged wife, Savannah's mother. Video of the shooting showed deputies shot and killed Savannah, who was unarmed, as she followed a deputy's instructions to move towards him. Police claimed she was wearing body-armor at the time of the shootout, though video did not show this.\n\n\n== Events ==\n\n\n=== Murder of Tracy Martinez ===\nOn September 26, Anthony Graziano fatally shot Tracy Martinez, his estranged wife and Savannah's mother, outside her house in Fontana, California. Witnesses reported seeing Savannah sitting in the back of her father's pick-up truck during the shooting. After killing Martinez, Anthony fired at a nearby vehicle outside a nearby school, then drove north with Savannah. An Amber Alert was issued for Savannah Graziano following Martinez's murder.\n\n\n=== Shootout ===\nA 911 caller reported seeing Anthony Graziano's vehicle in the Barstow area the morning of September 27. Deputies pursued the truck on the highway for around 45 minutes, during which several shots were fired from it towards officers. The sheriff's department stated that Anthony fired at police, and that Savannah may also have. Anthony's vehicle became disabled in the Hesperia area and a shootout began. During the shootout Savannah, who was unarmed, exited the vehicle from the passenger's side and ran towards deputies. A deputy yelled for Savannah to come to him, but when she did several other deputies fired at her. The first deputy yelled \"Hey! Stop! Stop shooting her! He's in the car!\" Anthony was also killed in the shootout.\nFollowing the shootout, San Bernardino Sherriff Shannon Dicus said Savannah Grazino was a \"participant in shooting at our deputies\". Police also claimed Savannah was wearing tactical gear, but video footage did not show this.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nThe California Department of Justice is investigating the shooting per a state law that requires the agency to investigate all police shootings where unarmed civilians are killed.\n\n\n== See also ==\n2014 Stockton bank robbery\n2018 Los Angeles hostage incident\n2019 Miramar shootout\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Point Wolfe Bridge is a red covered bridge that crosses the Point Wolfe River at Fundy National Park in New Brunswick, Canada. It is one of the two covered bridges in Fundy National Park, connecting the Point Wolfe Road from the Point Wolfe campground to the rest of the park. It was originally built in 1909, following the collapse of a bridge one year prior. The Point Wolfe Bridge was once again rebuilt in 1992 after a workplace accident in December 1990 resulted in the bridge collapsing.\n\n\n== History ==\nSince 1853, there have been a total of five bridges that have stood in the location of Point Wolfe Bridge. One of these bridges fell in 1908, was rebuilt in 1909, and opened in 1910 at a cost of $1,456. The Point Wolfe Bridge predates Fundy National Park, which was created on April 10, 1948, and officially opened on July 29, 1950.On December 29, 1990, the Point Wolfe Bridge collapsed when workers tried removing rock that posed a safety risk to the bridge. As they were using explosives to remove the rock, a chunk knocked the bridge, causing it to collapse. Shortly following the accident, the federal government announced that they would be rebuilding the bridge with close resemblance to the former one, with a temporary bridge being used in the meantime. In 1992, it was rebuilt at a cost of CA$545,000.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of covered bridges in New Brunswick\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Konrad Badacz (born 16 January 2003) is a Polish biathlete. He made his debut in the Biathlon World Cup in  2023.\n\n\n== Career ==\nKonrad Badacz gained international experience at the 2020 Youth Olympic Games in Lausanne but missed out on top-10 finishes due to shooting errors. He later participated in the 2020 Youth World Championships, achieving a sixth-place finish in the relay event. In January 2021, he made his debut in the IBU Cup but achieved only lower placements. By the end of the season, he won a gold medal in the relay event at the 2021 Youth World Championships with teammates Jan Guńka and Marcin Zawół. In the winter of 2021/22, Badacz competed in the IBU Junior Cup, winning a race with the men's relay team in Martell. In the 2022 Youth World Championships, he narrowly missed a medal, finishing fourth in the sprint, but secured a silver medal at the 2022 Youth Olympic Festival in the sprint event. In the winter of 2022/23, Badacz had a successful season, winning two races in the IBU Junior Cup and achieving top-30 results in the IBU Cup, including a 15th place in the sprint in Osrblie. He also participated in the 2023 European Championships, finishing 71st in the sprint. At the 2023 Junior European Championships, he won a bronze medal in the sprint, and at the Junior World Championships, he finished 11th in both the sprint and pursuit events.\n\nIn the early winter of 2023/24, Badacz made his World Cup debut in Östersund. After several placements outside the top 60, he improved significantly in the sprint event in Oberhof, finishing 35th and earning his first World Cup points.

        "content": "The American Privacy Rights Act (APRA) is a comprehensive data privacy law proposed in the United States. It would place limitations on the kinds of data companies can collect about their users, create processes for users to access or remove data about them, and allow users opt-out from having data sold by data brokers. The bipartisan proposal was introduced in April 2024 by Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), and Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA). Cantwell is Chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and McMorris Rodgers is Chair of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. If passed, it would supersede a collection of state-based laws which have emerged in the absence of a comprehensive federal data privacy law. \n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Constitution of the United States and the United States Bill of Rights do not explicitly include a right to privacy, no federal law takes a holistic approach to privacy legislation, and the US has no national data protection authority. As a result, in most states and for most companies there are no limits to how they use, share, or sell their users data and no requirements to notify users when or how they do so.The laws which have been passed focus on specific types of data or specific populations of data subjects. The Privacy Act of 1974, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) of 1996, and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998, for example, regulate the use of data by federal agencies, how patients' health data is communicated, and aspects of collecting data about children. In the absence of a federal data privacy law, several states have passed laws to like the 2008 Biometric Information Privacy Act in Illinois and the 2018 California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). As of 2021, only California, Colorado, and Virginia had enacted comprehensive data privacy legislation.There have been multiple attempts to pass a comprehensive data privacy law, such as the Personal Data Privacy and Security Act of 2009 and the American Data Privacy and Protection Act (ADPPA) in 2022. Both had bipartisan support and passed committees, but were not brought up for a vote. A common sticking point in debates over these laws is the relationship between the federal law and current or future state laws. There has also been disagreement about enforcement, including whether users could use the laws as a basis to sue companies directly for privacy violations. Senator Cantwell, one of the lawmakers behind the APRA, opposed the ADPPA on the basis of its enforcement.The idea of a comprehensive federal data protection law gained increased attention and support in the early 2020s. Privacy experts, technologist journalists, and consumer advocacy organizations have spoken in support of ADPPA and others, like APRA, which focus on \"data minimization\" rather than \"notice and consent\" (\"notice and choice\") frameworks. Notice and consent is the standard by which a company displays a notification to users inviting them to read lengthy legal documents about their use of data and asking them to accept the terms in order to continue using the website or application. It has been widely criticized for its failure to provide real protections for user privacy. Data minimization places limits on what data can be collected in the first place rather than simply dictate how use of data is communicated. US President Joe Biden included the importance of such a data privacy law in his 2023 State of the Union address.According to The Washington Post, data privacy is an \"issue that has befuddled lawmakers despite near-universal agreement -- in Silicon Valley and in Washington -- on the need for federal standards to determine how much information companies can collect from consumers online\".\n\n\n== Provisions ==\nThe American Privacy Rights Act would create limitations on the kinds of data companies can collect about their users. It includes provisions to give users the ability to access the data companies have about them as well as to make changes or remove such data and restricts the ability of companies to impose mandatory arbitration. It creates a registry for data brokers and includes opt-out procedures for consumers who do not want their data sold or used for personalized advertising.APRA expands some of the California law's enforcement mechanisms, enabling not just the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to take legal action against violators, but also state attorneys general and private citizens. Except in cases of a \"substantial privacy harm\", companies have a 30-day window after being notified of a violation to make a correction.The legislation would apply to businesses that sell users data or which have more than $40 million in annual revenue, intended to apply primarily to those with greater than $250 million in revenue (\"large data holders\").\n\n\n== Legislative history ==\nThe bipartisan proposal was introduced in April 2024 by two Washington lawmakers, Senator Maria Cantwell and Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers. Cantwell is a Democrat who serves as Chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and McMorris Rodgers is a Republican who chairs the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. Cantwell did not support the ADPPA, which is part of why that legislation stalled, according to The Verge. She wanted individuals to be more empowered to sue companies for violating their privacy rights. In that and other ways, some state laws took privacy measures further than the ADPPA, leading to some Democratic opposition for the way the federal policy would supersede the states. APRA would still override most of the state laws, but was written to incorporate elements of those laws in part to overcome such objections.McMorris Rodgers' Democratic counterpart on the House committee, Frank Pallone of New Jersey, called the draft \"very strong\" but said he wanted to see greater protections applied to children.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAmerican Privacy Rights Act Section-by-Section Summary by the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, & Transportation",

        "content": "Depublizieren is the process of removing websites from publicly accessible areas, which the online services (Telemedia) of the public broadcasters in Germany began in the summer of 2009 for their archive holdings and, since September 1, 2010, also for current reporting after a period of generally seven days. Websites that have been removed by the Interstate Broadcasting Agreement (RStV) do not have to be deleted but are no longer publicly accessible.\nAccording to ARD, Germany's process for depublizieren public service websites is the most complex in the world. Although the BBC has also reduced its online services to justify its license fee funding, the Public-Value-Test used in the UK - the model for the German three-step test - only applies to major projects. In contrast to the German broadcasters, the ORF refrains from a retrospective review of existing offerings. Estimates of the total volume of older public service Internet content that has been decommissioned are more than one million online documents.\nThe term \"depublizieren\" or \"depublication\" is also used when controversial or erroneous online content is removed from the publicly accessible area. It is also used for private media.\n\n\n== Concept ==\nDepublizieren is a neologism from the word publication (publish, from Latin publicus, public) and the Latin prefix de- (\"off\", \" gone\", \"down\", \"miss\"). The term, which is not used on a legal basis, was hardly used before 2010. Earlier definitions of depublizieren as \"unpublishing\" referred to the removal of factually incorrect content from the Internet without comment instead of correction or, as a technical term, to the withdrawal of a contribution visible on a website without its deletion from the repository. Technically, the latter meaning corresponds to using the term in the discussion about depublishing public Internet content.\nThe formation of the term contains a paradoxical element, as the terms \"publishing\" or \" publicizing\" do not actually permit this form of formation of antonyms: a statement made to the public by publication cannot be retracted by not continuing to disseminate it, but only by revocating it. Therefore, a person harmed by untrue media reports can regularly assert a claim for a right of reply or rectification (→ right to rectification).\nHowever, such a corrective revocation is not meant when depublishing public service content. The use of the term by the employees and committees of public broadcasters responsible for the organization of depublizieren made the term a buzzword in the summer of 2010, which, due to its contradictory nature, tends to criticize the removal of websites (→ Reactions section). What is published on the internet cannot be taken back; this is conceptually \"silly\" and a \"fight against windmills\" (Johnny Haeusler). Depublizieren was named early on as a possible un-word of the year 2010.\n\n\n== Previous history ==\n\nIn 2003, the German Association of Private Broadcasters and Telemedia (VPRT) filed a complaint with the European Commission, describing the broadcast receiving license as illegal state aid under Article\n\n§ 87\nEG (in German)\nparagraph 1 of the Treaty of Rome (EGV) - now Article 107 paragraph 1 of the TFEU Treaty. This funding distorts competition and puts private companies at a disadvantage, especially since public broadcasters do not have a narrowly defined functional mandate for their activities, especially in the online sector. Although the federal states and the broadcasters themselves had never considered the financing of the fees as a state subsidy, the EU Commission followed the VPRT's interpretation and demanded that this aid be abolished or that the exemption criteria of Article\n\n§ 86\nEG (in German)\nparagraph 2 of the Treaty of Rome (EGV) be fulfilled. An open conflict arose in the summer of 2007:\n\n\"When ARD published its digital strategy in mid-June 2007, its plans to significantly expand its online activities and digital offerings were met with fierce protests from its private competitors, both the Association of Private Broadcasting and Telemedia (VPRT) and the Federal Association of German Newspaper Publishers/Federal Association of German Newspaper Publishers (BDZV), whose members want to operate (online) television themselves in future.\"\nHowever, Article 5 of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany guarantees \"freedom of the press and freedom of reporting through broadcasting and film\", and although public service broadcasting is not explicitly mentioned there, this includes its reporting and press products. On September 11, 2007, the Federal Constitutional Court stated that the mandate of public service broadcasting also extends to new digital offerings and contains a \"development guarantee\" (already stated in earlier broadcasting rulings by the court). According to this, public service broadcasting is to ensure the diversity of offerings and the reliability of information on the internet - it is attributed a \"genuine online mandate\". \"The Supreme Court's ruling on fees was seen as a victory for public service broadcasting.\"\nThe State Aid Compromise of 2007 between the Federal Republic of Germany and the EU Commission stipulated that \"the functional mandate of the public broadcasters will be sufficiently specified\" by June 1, 2009, and in particular that its extension to online offerings will be defined. This compromise averted a case before the European Court of Justice, which could have \"called into question the financing of broadcasting in the entire EU\".\n\n\n== Legal basis ==\n\n\n=== Objective ===\nOn June 1, 2009, the 12th Amendment to the Interstate Broadcasting Treaty (12th RÄStV) came into force, with which the federal states wanted to fulfill their obligations from the State Aid Compromise and at the same time secure the constitutionally guaranteed independence of the public media.\nThe 12th Interstate Broadcasting Treaty (RÄStV) should fully transfer the traditional mission of the public broadcasters to the online sector, as the \"density of households that are technically connected to the Internet and use Internet services\" has increased considerably and the development guarantee confirmed by the Federal Constitutional Court requires this. To meet the requirements of the EU Commission, however, one aspect in particular must be taken into account:\n\n\"Similar to the previous requirement for public broadcasting, public Telemedia must also distinguish itself from commercial offerings, which are not only provided by private broadcasters but also by a large number of other market participants via the Internet.\"\n\n\n=== Broadcasting concept ===\nHowever, the 12th RÄStV also included a change to the definition of broadcasting. Section 2, paragraph 1, of the new RStV now states:\n\n\"Broadcasting is a linear information and communication service; it is the presentation and distribution of moving images or sounds according to a broadcast schedule using electromagnetic oscillations, intended for the general public and simultaneous reception.\"\nAccording to the explanatory memorandum of the 12th Interstate Broadcasting Treaty, the new aspect is \"the clarification that broadcasting is a linear information and communication service. The insertion of the criterion 'for simultaneous reception' distinguishes broadcasting services from on-demand services. Simultaneous reception is also to be understood as a transmission which is subject to short delays for technical reasons alone\". The linearity criterion excludes, for example, the independent presentation of user-generated content and the form of an online community. The exclusion of on-demand offerings is the basis for the definition of dwell times for public Internet offerings (→ section Dwell times). Without the broad understanding of \"simultaneous\", which allows for short delays \"for technical reasons\", this redefinition would not allow public service content to be accessed over the Internet.\nIn the 12th version of the RStV, which has been in force since 2009, public broadcasters are no longer allowed to offer \"non-broadcast press-like offerings\" and \"comprehensive local reporting\" according to Section 11d. This paragraph also includes an addendum with various forms of offerings that are not permitted for the online presence of public broadcasters, including, for example, file-sharing platforms, route planners, and classified ads.\n\n\n=== Dwell times ===\nOn December 18, 2008, the state governments agreed in the 12th RÄStV that broadcasters may normally make program-related content available for seven days. According to Section 11d, Paragraph 2, RStV, exceptions apply, among other things, to soccer coverage of 1st and 2nd Bundesliga matches, which may only be available for 24 hours, and to archives \"with contemporary and cultural history content\", which may be online for an unlimited period.\nAccording to the explanatory memorandum of the 12th RÄStV, \"the provision of contemporary and cultural history content in the form of Telemedia corresponds to the democratic, social and cultural needs of society\". The restriction of soccer coverage is justified with \"higher costs for the acquisition of additional rights\" for a longer on-demand option, which \"should be avoided in the interest of the license fee payers\".\nTo meet the requirements of the EU Commission about the specification of their functional mandate without interfering with their constitutional independence, the federal states prescribed the three-step test as a procedure for the public broadcasters to check the conformity of the offer with the mandate in each case. However, the decision on the continuation of old offers and the introduction of new concepts on the Internet and in broadcasting was left to the broadcasting bodies themselves, the Broadcasting Councils. These bodies also decide on the duration of online services.\n\n\n== Procedure ==\n\n\n=== Three-step test ===\nAccordingly, the competent Broadcasting Councils (Television Council, Radio Council) decide in a five-stage procedure whether or not an offer meets the three-stage test criteria, namely\n\n1. the extent to which the offering meets the democratic, social and cultural needs of society,2. the extent to which the offering contributes to journalistic competition in terms of quality and3. the financial outlay required for the offering.\nIf a Broadcasting Board determines that an offering is new or substantially changed and is neither already legally required nor already legally prohibited (Phase 1), it initiates the procedure (Phase 2) based on a specific description of the offering, the central element of which is the collection of information (Phase 3), on which the Broadcasting Board's decision, including the statement of reasons (Phase 4), and the final review by the responsible state government as the legal supervisor (Phase 5) are based.\nThe information gathering phase includes, in particular, obtaining the views of competing suppliers and the views of independent experts on the impact of the proposed transaction on competition. Comments and economic data from private competitors (which are taken into account in the procedure but are not published) could, for example, state that \"offers already on the market will be completely crowded out\", which would affect the second three-step test criterion. However, according to the three-step test, the determination of the \"democratic, social and cultural needs of society\" and the quality of a service in terms of journalistic competition are also important elements in answering the question of whether or not a specific service falls within the remit of public service broadcasting. Only after all of this has been weighed against the costs of a service can a broadcasting council decide on the admissibility of an offer, justify its decision and pass it on to the respective state government responsible for legal supervision: The legal supervision checks compliance with the procedural rules, but does not make its assessment of the content (otherwise it would be a constitutionally inadmissible \"technical supervision\" in the broadcasting sector).\nThe results of the subsequent three-stage tests for the existing offerings were published in summer 2010. Saarland Broadcasting, among others, summarized the considerations on media use on which its dwell time concept was based:\n\n\"Viewers and listeners use media libraries to rewatch or replay shows and program segments. They select functions such as the program calendar or \"Missed a Show?\" or search for access via the familiar station brand. Based on the culturally 'learned' broadcasting week, the so-called 'seven-day catch-up' has established itself as the minimum supply period in many European countries, especially with regard to video use. [...] While this type of use is based on the pattern of using linear media in a so-called lean-back posture, an Internet-specific use of image, text and multimedia content has established itself in parallel, which has no reference to broadcasting weeks or program calendars and corresponds to an active lean-forward posture. This content is often accessed via search functions or researched by topic. As a rule, it is provided in multimedia combinations of various web-specific forms of presentation in Telemedia.\"\nBecause of this distinction between two usage patterns, public broadcasters typically make a large portion of their online offerings available for seven days (lean-back approach) and another portion for a longer period, such as a year (lean-forward approach).\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nFollowing the adoption of the 12th RÄStV, there were several media debates in 2009 and 2010 about the three-step tests and the resulting restrictions on public online offerings. Private media companies and publishers' associations were less critical of ZDF than of ARD, which is much more complexly organized with a total of 37 three-stage tests. During this period, representatives of public and private media often met in panel discussions. The new legal regulations were criticized with combative terms such as \"Morgenthau Plan\" or \"censorship\", while private publishers often used the catchword \"electronic press\" for the online offerings of the broadcasters.\nAfter the completion of the Telemedia concepts in the summer of 2010, the length of time that various television genres remained in the media libraries and the deletion of online contributions became much-discussed topics \"that arouse the ire of Internet users and are ostentatiously regretted by those responsible at the broadcasters. Like some ARD broadcasters, ZDF announced the removal of about 80 percent of its online content, which it estimated at 93,500 individual documents. ZDF director-general Markus Schächter said he hoped this would put an end to the debate about public broadcasters' online activities:\n\n\"The interests of publishers and commercial broadcasters have been taken very much into account. At the same time, the review has shown that the impact of our offerings on the business models of commercial broadcasters is marginal.\"\nSome politicians are also critical of depublizieren, with the SPD in Saarland and the Pirate Party in Brandenburg both rejecting it in their manifestos. In January 2013, the Internet and Digital Society Study Commission (EIDG) of the German Parliament, consisting of 17 experts and 17 members of parliament from all parties, explicitly recommended the abolition of the depublizieren obligation stipulated in the Interstate Broadcasting Treaty. Representatives of the governing coalition, however, only wanted the seven-day rule to be lifted for offerings that represent a \"qualitative added value\" compared to existing offerings from private providers.\n\n\n=== Biased reports ===\nWhen the first articles disappeared from their online offerings, the editorial teams of the public broadcasters were initially confronted with questions about the supposed deletion of websites. They used the term depublizieren to explain the process and to clarify the difference with the deletion of websites, and were confronted with critical opinions from the public, which had already been anticipated in public statements:\n\n\"Many users are outraged that content created and published with their broadcast fees will no longer be available as of September 1, 2010.\"\nThe coverage of the three-stage review process was so negative in the spring of 2010 that the Conference of Commission Chairmen of the Association of State Media Authorities felt compelled to complain about the poor quality of reporting. Among other things, \"abbreviated, incorrect and one-sided\" reports were made from confidential documents, giving \"the impression that the committees are avoiding transparency in a quasi-autocratic and interest-driven manner. At the same time, however, the influence of lobbying by publishers and private broadcasters has already been pointed out, in whose interests the extensive curtailment of public service online activities is taking place, although they are not satisfied with the result. In the spring of 2010, media journalist Stefan Niggemeier drew attention to the conflict of interest between private media providers and public service media, which has led to biased reporting by both groups.\nThe most critical coverage of the depublizieren that began in the summer after the Telemedia concepts were decided on largely corresponded to the relationship of the depublizieren editors to their work, as Niggemeier made clear in one of the first newspaper reports entitled Depublizieren:\n\n\"But there is a lot of frustration among editors - and concern about how something like this changes the relationship with the medium of the Internet. [...] One colleague fears that if only a limited amount of content is allowed online anyway, the willingness to produce complex content in the first place could diminish.\"\nThe public broadcasters' reporting therefore also expressed their dissatisfaction with the depublizieren process and referred to the broadcasters' legal obligation to do so. Following accusations by the BDZV that the depublizieren of ARD online content did not go far enough and was, therefore, a farce, ARD Chairman Peter Boudgoust summarized that ARD had depublished more than one million Internet pages, including around 80 percent of the original pages of tagesschau.de. ARD had not wanted this procedure, but had \"complied with applicable law in its implementation\". Unfortunately, it was \"primarily the users who had to pay the price\". In July 2010, at the same time as the decision-making phase for the Telemedia concepts, the now defunct website www.depublizieren.de was created as a protest against depublizieren, containing a fictitious death notice for \"Die Publizierung\".\nRepresentatives of private media groups also expressed mild criticism of the three-step test, describing it as a \"relatively pointless procedure\". The removed content meant that \"no publisher earned a single euro more\". RTL Group announced that it was \"still considering legal action against some online publications of ARD and ZDF\".\n\n\n=== Depub.org ===\n\nThe depublizieren of public Internet content received a new wave of public attention after the implementation of concepts developed for this purpose in September 2010: After an archive of tagesschau.de articles written between 1999 and 2010 had already been offered on the BitTorrent download portal The Pirate Bay in July 2010, the website depub.org put preparation of this archived content online for free retrieval on August 20, 2010, so that users could similarly access the articles to the version on tagesschau.de before depublication. The offer also included the function of continuously archiving current articles from tagesschau.de and making them available on depub.org. Thus, depub.org also acted as a mirror for some articles that had not yet been depublished by tagesschau.de.\nNumerous German-language media reported on depub.org, especially from mid-September 2010, emphasizing that depub.org was \"trying to get hold of the already deleted content of other public media\" and relying on the help of their editors: \"We are confident that there are also people in the other newsrooms who do not want the articles to disappear from the web.\" Robin Meyer-Lucht quoted an NDR spokesperson: \"NDR will take legal action against Depub.org if possible. Indications of a possible unauthorized republication of depublished tagesschau.de content had already come from the editorial team itself in July 2010. Depub.org claimed to have asked the editorial team before republishing the tagesschau.de content. The response from the editorial team warned: \"that an archive could affect the copyrights of third parties, such as agencies or photographers, and that it is therefore at our own risk to operate such an archive.\" According to the response, depub.org \"has reason to believe that the Tagesschau.de editorial team has no major problems with the archive.\n\nZeit editor Kai Biermann described the depub.org campaign as civil courage in the \"public interest,\" even though it was illegal. Depublication, on the other hand, is \"an expression of the egoistic interests of private companies. Due to the method of \"calculated law breaking for idealistic reasons\", the depub.org activists were often accused of being \"Robin Hoods\".\nDepub.org announced its intention to set up archives for the public Internet offerings br-online.de, hr-online.de, mdr.de, ndr.de, rbb-online.de, radiobremen.de, swr.de, wdr.de and heute.de. Publicly available articles would be stored for this purpose. For content that has already been published, however, the company relies on editors to provide archive data.\nDagmar Gräfin Kerssenbrock, a CDU politician from Schleswig-Holstein and chairwoman of the NDR broadcasting council, called depub.org \"an example of the creative anarchy on the Internet\" and of the great interest in the content of tagesschau.de. Therefore, \"there will always be people who find a way to make this content available. Sites like depub.org are proof of the dubious nature of the three-step test. The Tagesschau online editorial team suspects that the contents of the anonymously registered domain depub.org in Canada were collected while the articles, which have now been published, were still publicly accessible. However, according to tagesschau.de editor-in-chief Jörg Sadrozinski, the illegal use of tagesschau.de articles by depub.org could lead to \"politicians or lobbyists in publishing houses realizing that such measures are simply pointless, that the Internet never forgets\".\nWhen the depub.org domain became unavailable in mid-October 2010, the service moved to depub.info for a short time. However, this site was soon unavailable as well. Between November 10, 2010, and July 13, 2011, when a Twitter message was sent to the tagesschau.de archive, there were no public messages from the depub.org activists.\n\n\n=== Evaluation & Berlin requirements 2014 ===\nOn July 1, 2014, the Berlin House of Deputies called on the Senate to review the practice, which had been in place for five years, and to abolish the obligation to depublish.\nNetzpolitik.org reported in 2017 that it was \"difficult to explain to viewers why contributions financed by the general public should not be permanently available\". The vast majority of federal states are in favor of abolition.\n\n\n=== Reform concept of the ZDF ===\nSince May 2019, public broadcasters have been allowed to develop new digital offerings, provided they are based on a concept approved by the supervisory bodies.\nThe ZDF presented a reform concept for this in 2019. According to this concept, contemporary and cultural history archives with informative, educational, and cultural telemedia will be offered for an unlimited period. On the other hand, educational content from the fields of science, technology, theology or ethics, political education, the environment, work, and social affairs, as well as cultural content that documents cultural achievements in their social context, will be discontinued after five years.\nA total of 17 comments were received by the deadline of October 28. In a joint open letter to the ZDF Television Council, the GEW trade union, the German Library Association, and Wikimedia, among others, called for a rethink. This reform concept would not do justice to \"the important role of public broadcasting in the German educational landscape of the 21st century\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nDreistufentest (Memento from February 8, 2011, in the Internet Archive) In: ARD.de.\nDaniel Bouhs: Die digitale Schranke.

        "content": "Bierlein's measure extension theorem is a result from measure theory and probability theory on extensions of probability measures. The theorem makes a stament about when one can extend a probability measure to a larger σ-algebra. It is of particular interest for infinite dimensional spaces.\nThe theorem is named after the German mathematician Dietrich Bierlein, who proved the statement for countable families in 1962.  The general case was shown by Albert Ascherl and Jürgen Lehn in 1977.\n\n\n== A measure extension theorem of Bierlein ==\nLet \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        X\n        ,\n        \n          \n            A\n          \n        \n        ,\n        μ\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (X,{\\mathcal {A}},\\mu )}\n  \n be a probability space and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            S\n          \n        \n        ⊂\n        \n          \n            P\n          \n        \n        (\n        X\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {S}}\\subset {\\mathcal {P}}(X)}\n  \n be a σ-algebra, then in general \n  \n    \n      \n        μ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu }\n  \n can not be extended to \n  \n    \n      \n        σ\n        (\n        \n          \n            A\n          \n        \n        ∪\n        \n          \n            S\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sigma ({\\mathcal {A}}\\cup {\\mathcal {S}})}\n  \n.

        "content": "Gottschedstrasse is a residential street in Leipzig, Germany, in the so-called theater district (in German language: Schauspielviertel) of the Innere Westvorstadt (inner west Vorstadt). It extends over a length of around 650 m (2,132.5 ft) in an east–west direction from the Inner City Ring Road at the level of St. Thomas Church to the Poniatowski monument at Elstermühlgraben. It is named after the writer, literary and theater theorist Johann Christoph Gottsched (1700–1766). It is primarily known as a pub and nightlife area.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSince 1692, there was a French formal garden which was called after his last owner in the 19th century Lehmann's garden. When the city was growing rapidly, a development plan  for this area was made. The extended Poniatowski Street (a planned part of the development plan for Lehmann's Garden) and the first half of Poniatowski Street, which was laid out in 1867, were renamed Gottsched Street in 1881 and 1882, respectively. This corresponds to today's section between Bosestrasse and Thomasiusstrasse. After the remaining garden area around today's Bosestrasse was redeveloped, Gottschedstrasse was extended to the inner city ring in 1898; the last section up to today's Dittrichring was part of Zentralstrasse until then. At the end of the street on today's Poniatowskiplan, formerly on the site of Gerhard's Garden, there is still the Poniatowski Monument, which commemorates the death of the Polish general Józef Antoni Poniatowski during the Battle of Leipzig in 1813.\nFrom 1901 to 1902, the originally privately run Centraltheater was built between Gottschedstrasse and Thomasring (today Dittrichring) on Bosestrasse, which was transferred to municipal ownership in 1912 as part of the Leipzig Theater.\nIn 1934 the street was given its current length and route, and on 1 January 1934 the remaining part of Poniatowskistrasse was also renamed Gottschedstrasse. This sparked outrage among Polish immigrants in Leipzig and led to a protest note from the Polish government.\n\nOn 4 December 1943, by the Bombing of Leipzig in World War II, all city theaters were heavily or completely destroyed. The Central Theater, which was least affected, was partially restored immediately after the end of the war and reopened as a theater on 19 December 1945. Between 1954 and 1957 the building was rebuilt in a partly neoclassical style with the main entrance on Bosestrasse and is still the main and secondary stage (e.g. the former venues Skala and Theater hinterm Eisernen) of the Schauspiel Leipzig.\nFor several decades since 1957, the extensive Tanzarchiv der Akademie der Künste der DDR (Dance archive of the Academy of Arts of the GDR), now the Tanzarchiv Leipzig e.V., was located at Gottschedstrasse 16, then the so-called Haus der Kammerspiele.\nIn the mid-1990s, the Maga Pon café with a Self-service laundry was opened in one of the numerous buildings in need of renovation at the time, and it quickly became very popular among Leipzig students and artists. In the following years, more cafés, bars and pubs were opened, and Gottschedstrasse has since established itself as one of Leipzig's pub miles. Since the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Gottschedstrasse has been one of the city of Leipzig's fan miles for international football tournaments, so also in UEFA Euro 2024. When traveling on foot from the Markt S-Bahn station to the stadium or to the indoor-arena Leipzig, Gottschedstrasse / Elsterstrasse is the shortest connection.\n\n\n== Monument protection ==\nTo this day, some of the buildings on the street consist of representative revenue houses in closed developments, which were built from the end of the 19th century and offered space for small businesses on the lower floors . Almost all buildings are listed buildings, starting with house number 1 (Kosmoshaus), through house numbers 4 (with a memorial plaque for the painter Max Schwimmer), 6, 8 (theater), 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 44 to 45.\n\n\n== The Leipzig Synagogue and the commemoration of its destruction ==\n\nFrom 1855 to 1938, the Leipzig Synagogue - the oldest and most important synagogue in Leipzig - was located at Gottschedstrasse 3, at the corner of Zentralstrasse, and was styled in Moorish Revival architecture. During the November pogroms, the building was set on fire on the night of November 9 to 10, 1938 and largely destroyed. The Israelite religious community then ensured the demolition of the ruins, which lasted until February 1939. Immediately after the destruction, Hubert Ritter, the local city planning officer until 1930, submitted a project sketch for the new development of the site on behalf of the Leipzig Insurance Company on 23 December 1938, but it received no attention. The area then lay fallow for a long time and was largely used as a parking lot until 2000. Since 1966, a memorial stone on the site of the former north facade commemorates the synagogue. In 2001, the former location of the synagogue was converted into a memorial in memory of the November pogroms of 1938. The memorial was designed by the Leipzig architects Sebastian Helm and Anna Dilengite. It traces the floor plan of the synagogue and offers a memorial place with 140 bronze chairs.\n\n\tCommemoration\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notable former residents ==\nThe first Leipzig apartment of the Austrian composer, conductor and Kapellmeister Gustav Mahler (1860–1911), who worked in the city from 1886 to 1888, was on the second floor of what is now Gottschedstrasse 25 (then 4) from 1886 to the end of January 1887. Walter Ulbricht, who later became a politician and chairman of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the State Council of the GDR, was born in the attic apartment in the same house in 1893 and spent the first seven years of his life there. On 30 June 1969, on the occasion of his 76th birthday, a memorial plaque was unveiled at the house, which was removed by an unknown hand in the summer of 1994. The later politician and Reichskanzler Gustav Stresemann also moved into Gottschedstrasse 25 around 1899 as a student at the University of Leipzig.\nThe cantor, composer and religious teacher Albert Weill lived on the second floor of today's Gottschedstrasse 40 (then Poniatowskistrasse 12) from 1920 to 1930. From June to December 1920, his son, the composer Kurt Weill (1900–1950), also lived there. Joachim Ringelnatz (1883–1934) and his family also lived in this house from 1894 to 1900.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nKlank, Gina; Griebsch, Gernoth (1995). Stadtarchiv Leipzig (ed.).

        "content": "Włodzimierz Jan Sieradzki (October 22, 1870, Wieliczka – July 4, 1941, Lviv) was a Polish physician, specializing in forensic medicine. He was a professor at Jan Kazimierz University and served as its rector during the academic year 1924–1925.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWłodzimierz Sieradzki was born on October 22, 1870, in Wieliczka, to parents Apolinarego and Zofii z Boratyńskich. From 1881, he attended St. Anne's Gymnasium in Krakow, later in Rzeszow, but completed his final years of high school at the gymnasium in Jaslo, where he graduated in 1888. He began his medical studies in 1888 at the Medical Faculty of Jagiellonian University, where he received the golden scholarship of Emperor Francis Joseph and Empress Elizabeth. On July 11, 1894, he obtained a doctorate in medical sciences. From November 10, 1895, to July 10, 1896, he pursued supplementary studies in forensic medicine and toxicology in Paris, thanks to the Kasperk scholarship under a resolution of the Academic Senate of Jagiellonian University.\nOn July 15, 1896, he was appointed a forensic expert for the Krakow district by the Regional Court in Krakow. On October 1, 1898, he was entrusted with the organization of the Department of Forensic Medicine at the University of Lviv and its management. He served as the head of the department continuously for 42 years until 1941. In 1899, he obtained the title of associate professor of forensic medicine. From 1904, he was a full professor and head of the Department of Forensic Medicine at Jan Kazimierz University. He served as dean of the Faculty of Medicine several times (1908–1909, 1919–1920) and rector of Jan Kazimierz University during the academic year 1924–1925. He was a member of the Supreme Health Council and the Health Council of the Lviv Region, president (later honorary member) of the Lviv Medical Society, honorary member of the Vilnius Medical Society, co-founder of the Polish Society of Forensic and Criminal Medicine, and a member of the board of the People's School Society and the Polish Gymnastic Society \"Sokół\".He authored numerous publications on forensic medicine. In his research, he focused on the influence of carbon monoxide on various blood pigments such as hemoglobin, alkaline and acid hematin, acid and alkaline hematoporphyrin. Together with Leon Wachholz, he developed a new method for determining carbon monoxide hemoglobin – the \"Wachholz-Sieradzki test\", which became part of forensic literature worldwide. At his initiative, a laboratory for chemical-toxicological research was established at the Department of Forensic Medicine at the University of Lviv in 1927.\nHe perished in the Massacre of Lwów professors, murdered by the Germans on the night of July 4, 1941.\n\n\n== Orders and decorations ==\nCommander's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta (November 10, 1938)\nHaller Swords (before 1926)\nKnight of the Legion of Honour (France)\n\n\n== Family ==\nSince 1898, he was married to Karolina (Lina) née Zaremba (1878–1955), with whom he had a son Jerzy, who died defending Lviv, and a daughter Aleksandra (1900–1978), the wife of Polish Army Captain Kazimierz Nieżychowski. He was the grandfather of actor and journalist Jacek Nieżychowski.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Hexaemeron of Jacob of Serugh is a 6th-century text composed in the genre of Hexaemeral literature. As such, it offers a commentary on the Genesis creation narrative, and it is the first writing of this type to appear in the Syriac language. There was some precedent in the Commentary on Genesis by Ephrem the Syrian, but this was not a Hexaemeron. Likewise, there is no evident influence of a potential Syriac translation of the Hexaemeron of Basil of Caesarea on Jacob's work. Jacob dedicated a separate homily for each day of the creation week. \nJacob's traditionalist mode of exegesis follows the School of Antioch. He may have learned this tradition during his training in Edessa (located in modern-day Turkey). As such, he believed in the literal interpretation of the creation week, such as in the progressive creation of things in the order of days as opposed to the notion of simultaneous creation advocated by others like Augustine of Hippo.\nJacob opens his poetic homily with a prayer asking God to give him the ability to write about something that is beyond human speech. Jacob insists that God is the creator of all things and that creation occurred ex nihilo.\n\n\n== Content ==\n\n\n=== Events during the six days ===\nFor Jacob, the first day involved the creation of the elements out of which God would go on to create with in the succeeding days, beginning with the still formless Earth and the darkness. When describing God's works during the second days, Jacob distinguishes between two verbs used in the narrative: brʾ and bdʿ or: to create versus to make. Genesis 1:1, referring to the creation of the heavens and the Earth (and in general, matter and the elements) ex nihilo, uses the first verb and signifies God's rule as Creator. The second verb is used afterwards, on the second day to the sixth, signifying God's role as a 'Workman' who molds the created materials to produce additional forms and structures. When humans are eventually made in the sixth day they represent a microcosm of the universe, being composed of the same elements (earth, water, fire, and air) that the universe as a whole is. The beauty and perfection of the human is also indicative of the creation of the universe. The creation of Eve and the first blessed couple is what also caused jealousy in the devil who reacts by causing humans to rebel. Therefore: the sixth day also represents the fall of Satan and his hosts.\n\n\n=== Necessity of creation ===\nAlongside others in the Syriac tradition, such as Ephrem the Syrian and Narsai, Jacob did not believe that God needed the creation: \"when He had no need for it, He created them [creatures], and magnified them, as He was great, with beauties of their natures\".\n\n\n=== Firmament ===\nThe firmament was created in the second day in Genesis. Jacob invoked the popular architectural symbol of describing a domed church as representing a microcosm of the cosmos. Jacob believed that the cosmos corresponded, symbolically, to a two-storey building where a firmament separates the waters above from the waters below to create a dwelling place for mankind:The firmament came to exist in the middle of the waters on the second day,\nAs the Lord commanded it by a gesture of His creativity,\nAnd it became a limit between the waters for the waters above.\nAnd it became a shelter [mtaltha] for this dry place beneath.\nAnd it became a tent [maikna = Tabernacle] for the pounded depth of the whole world,\nAnd in its shadow dwells and rests the entire Creation.\nIt became the ceiling [tatlldl] for the great house of humankind,\nThat the gesture of the Deity built from nothing.\nIt became like a vault [kaphtha] that hangs and stands without foundation,\n\nAnd not columns but a gesture supports it.Likewise, Jacob partook in the debates concerning the meaning of the references to the pillars of the firmament. Basil of Caesarea, in his own Hexaemeron, took this to be a reference to God's power. In the fourth century, the Syriac Christian Aphrahat asserted that the firmament stands \"without pillars\". Jacob followed this position, also explicitly asserting that the firmament stood by God's power without foundation. Jacob's homilies on the subject appear to have influenced the same position in its appearance among both an anonymous mid-6th century hymn praising the beauty of a church dedicated to Saint Sophia in Edessa, and in the Quran.\n\n\n== Editions ==\nPaulus Bedjan (ed) with additional material by Sebastian P.

        "content": "Evelyn Henry Hill (5 April 1859 - 21 April 1915) was an association footballer and Church of England clergyman, who played in the 1880 FA Cup final.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHill was the son of the Rev. Henry Thomas Hill, the rector of Felton, Herefordshire, and he was baptized there on 15 May 1859.  He was educated at Malvern College from 1876 to 1877, and went up to Oriel College, Oxford in January 1878, aged 18.  He took his bachelor of arts in jurisprudence in 1882, although he only recorded a Fourth Class degree.\n\n\n== Sporting career ==\nHill was a useful cricketer, both with the bat and the ball, representing Herefordshire in 1878 and 1879, and had been part of the \"Next XVI\" at university.\nThere is however no record of Hill playing football before attending university; the first match he is noted as playing was at Maidenhead in the fourth round of the 1879–80 FA Cup as a right-sided forward - it was an auspicious debut as Hill scored the only goal, \"breasting\" home a ball which had spilt out of a goal-line scrimmage.\nHe played in the remaining Cup ties, and had a hand in the winning goal against Nottingham Forest in the semi-final, his cross from the right resulting in defensive confusion and the ball being parried to George Childs to score.  He remained on the right wing for the final, which the university lost to Clapham Rovers.\nThe final was his last Cup match; he played in both the 1880 and 1881 Varsity matches, both of which Cambridge University won.  The 1881 match is his last recorded fixture.\n\n\n== Post-football ==\nHill followed his father in taking holy orders, first practising as a solicitor after being articled to E. A. Bigg in Bristol.  He became curate of Rugeley in 1888 and vicar of Brereton, Staffordshire in 1896.\nHe married Ida Childe-Freeman on 5 April 1883, in Whitbourne, Herefordshire, with Evelyn's brother and Ida's father officiating at the ceremony.  Hill died in Droitwich in 1915.\n\n\n== External links ==\nCricket statistics  (NB: the Harrow School matches refer to Edward Henry Hills)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Colonel Sheldon Cradock (27 September 1777 – 19 February 1852) was an English landowner and Whig politician.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nCardock was born on 27 September 1777 as the eldest and only surviving son of Sheldon Cradock of Hartforth and Elizabeth Wilkinson (daughter and heiress of Christopher Wilkinson of Thorpe-on-Tees). He succeeded to his father's estates in County Durham in 1814,  where his family had been established since the 27th century. In 1730, his great-grandfather, William Cradock, had acquired the Hartforth estate (three miles from Richmond), and through his parent's marriage, they gained more Yorkshire property at Thorpe.\nHe was educated at Manchester Grammar School before matriculating at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1794.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHe was a Captain of the North Yorkshire Militia in 1800, a Major in 1804, Lt.-Col. in 1816, and Col. from 1820 to 1846.\nIn June 1822 he was returned on a vacancy alongside Mark Milbank for Camelford by his Durham neighbour, Lord Darlington (later the 1st Duke of Cleveland), after a contest. Milbank was Lord Darlington's son-in-law. After the parliamentary reforms, Cradock did not seek election.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nCardock, who never married, had nine illegitimate children, three sons and six daughters born between 1821 and 1836 by Jane Wilson, formerly of Saltburn, including:\n\nAnnie Cradock (b. 1823), who married François de Josselin.\nElizabeth Cradock (1824–1878), who married Samuel Smithson.\nChristopher Cradock (1825–1896), who entered Trinity College, Cambridge as Christopher Wilson in 1842; he married Georgina Cradock Duff.\nMary Cradock (1827–1917), who married William John Tweedie.\nFrances Cardock (1833–1889), who married Francis Horsley.\nMargaret Cradock (1837–1918), who married Robert Lidwill Brown, a son of John Brown and Mary Charlotte Lidwill, in 1862.\nCardock died on 19 February 1852. In his will, he left property at Marske to a \"single woman\", Jane Wilson, with remainder to his six daughters with her. He left property at Stapleton, near Darlington to his younger illegitimate sons, Richard and Henry. The primary family estates passed to his eldest son Christopher.\n\n\n=== Descendants ===\nThrough his son Christopher, he was a grandfather of Rear Admiral Sir Christopher Cradock, who was killed during the Battle of Coronel off the coast of Chile in November when the German ships sank his flagship.\nThrough his daughter Margaret, he was a grandfather of Helen Cowley Brow, who married Charles Sadleir Musgrave Trench (son of Hon. Cosby Godolphin Trench and a grandson of the 2nd Baron Ashtown).\n\n\n== References ==",

Assomo also served as the governor of Far North Region between 2010 and 2012 and Littoral Region between 2012 and 2015.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAssomo was born on August 17, 1959, in Ayos, Nyong-et-Mfoumou department, Cameroon. Assomo received his primary education at Ayos Main School and his secondary education at Akonolinga Mixed High School. He was admitted to both the International School of Journalism in Yaoundé and the National School of Administration and Magistracy of Cameroon. Assomo opted for the latter, majoring in general administration.Assomo began his professional career in 1983, as head of the cabinet of the governor of South Region, working in Ebolowa. Between 1990 and 1998, he was head of the sub-prefect of Ma'an, head of the sub-prefect of Mbankomo, and head of the Yaounde III sub-prefect. Between 1998 and 2005, he was head of Dja-et-Lobo department, and later head of Mfoundi department in 2005 and 2010. Between 2010 and 2012, he served as the governor of Far North Region and then governor of Littoral Region between 2012 and 2015. As governor of Littoral, Assomo hosted joint American and Cameroonian military exercises in the region.\nOn October 2, 2015, Assomo was appointed as the Cameroonian Minister of Defense, succeeding Edgar Alain Mebe Ngo'o. Assomo's administration has been accused of human rights abuses during the Anglophone Crisis and during the Boko Haram insurgency affecting northern Cameroon. Jeune Afrique dubbed Assomo as \"the enemy of Boko Haram\" due to his successes in fighting the group in Far North region. In 2022, Assomo stated that the Cameroonian military was \"winning the war\" against Boko Haram.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Kenneth R. Force, Captain, USMS (March 24, 1940 – October 7, 2023) was band director of the United States Merchant Marine Academy Regimental Band from 1971 to 2016. The New York Times described him as \"something of a Toscanini of military marching bands\" and a \"human encyclopedia of military ceremonial and musical data.\"\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn in Queens in 1940s New York to Alvina and George Force, Kenneth Richard Force was raised by parents who filled their home with the sounds of jazz, big band, and classical music.  His father, a banker, encouraged Kenneth's interest in music, including introduction to the trumpet, and exposure to Radio City Music Hall, Broadway, and the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey circuses. These experiences were formative in Force's lifelong musical interests.\nLater in life, Kenneth Force told Dr. Joan Baum in an interview that a particularly formative experience for him was in the third grade, in \"Sophie A.M. Smith’s P.S. 115’s classroom .... [when he] saw the only two pictures on the wall—Arturo Toscannini and Marian Anderson.\"\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Army service ===\nKenneth Force played with circus bands before joining the army. Early in his career, Kenneth Force joined and served in the U.S. Army, and though in the army studied trumpet at the Naval School of Music.  He performed in his first of more than 10 inaugural parades in 1957 for the second inauguration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, at which Marian Anderson would sing the national anthem.  Force would complete education at the Naval School of Music in 1958.\nForce described the experience in 1959 of playing with a British band during this period as being an \"epiphany.\" He would later tell the New York Times, \"It was like St. Paul on the Damascus Road, off the ferry marched the Band of Her Majesty’s Royal Marines Plymouth with pith helmets and a sound like an organ. You could actually hear their feet march when they went piano. And I just said, ‘This is it, man. I got to do that in this country.’ ”. As reported by the New York Times, a young Kenneth Force had asked the British band director if there was a manual, to which the British band director replied, \"Manual? It’s 300 years of tradition!”\nKenneth Force was a cornet soloist with the First U.S. Army Band at Governors Island, New York, and also as bandmaster for the 42nd Infantry (Rainbow) Division Band.\n\n\n=== Manhattan School of Music ===\nForce later attended the Manhattan School of Music, during which time he would perform with the Radio City Music Hall orchestra and on Broadway.  \nForce told the New York Times in 1989 that he would sneak out of class early to perform in a matinee Broadway show before the next class. He told an interviewer the last show he performed with on Broadway was \"My Fair Lady\" (during the original 1956-1962 Broadway run, originally casting Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews),  when he was advised by another musician that although he played well, he should get out of show business to find something more stable.\nForce would be offered the position of first chair trumpet with the Radio City Music Hall orchestra. Force also performed with Merle Evans, a legendary name who had performed with Buffalo Bill Cody's Wild West show, who later became band leader of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus band.\nKenneth Force earned a Bachelor of Music in 1964, as well as a Master of Music degree in 1965.  Force's master's thesis would be on British band concepts. Force would also complete a sixth year Professional Diploma in Education Administration and earn a master's degree in Counseling from the New York Institute of Technology.\n\n\n=== Port Chester High School ===\nFollowing his formal education at the Manhattan School of Music, Force served as high school band director in Port Chester, New York from 1966 to 1971.\nForce reformed the band in the British style of Her Majesty's Royal Marines, mixing European and American music.\nThe band became highly rated and regarded, winning first place recognition at the National Cherry Blossom Festival.  While traveling to the festival in Jamestown, Virginia, the band pulled into a motel outside Washington, DC where troops had been deployed following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.  Band director Kenneth Force responded by assembling his high school band students with their instruments in the parking lot to perform for two hours, soothing tensions among students. Kenneth Force later told The New York Times, ''It kind of helped quiet things down a bit. The kids were united through their music, showing the power that music has in uniting people in the midst of adversity.''\nThe band performed with the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus in Madison Square Garden in 1968. The site had originally been converted from rail station to public arena in 1874 by P.T. Barnum, in what Barnum originally called the \"Great Roman Hippodrome\" to host circuses and sporting events.  The building would later be sold, named Madison Square Garden, and rebuilt in 1925 and 1968.\nWhile he was band director at Port Chester, Force's band at Port Chester High School was selected to perform in the 1970 Rose Bowl parade, due to their uncommon British marching style and high performance level.  In preparation for the parade, the band received instruction from Drum Major John C. Moon, 1st Battalion of the Scots Guards, preparing for the parade by marching through Port Chester at 6am and providing performances to Port Chester's Mayor and President of the Board of Education.\nWhile at the 1970 parade, an alumnus from the United States Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA) who saw the performance referred Force to the USMMA, where Force was subsequently appointed as the academy's music director.\nThe Port Chester High School band performed circus music in 1971 in Baraboo, Wisconsin for the commemoration of the founding of the Ringling Bros. Circus.\nFormer students under Kenneth Force's instruction at Port Chester High School went on to become educators in music and professional musicians in major American orchestras, successes which Kenneth Force counted as his proudest accomplishment.\nThough serving as band director for only five years at Port Chester High School, Force's legacy at the school was enduring.  Through the decades he maintained his connection to, and support of, the music program at Port Chester High School.  The school in the summer of 2023 named their music room after Kenneth Force in an official ceremony.\n\n\n=== United States Merchant Marine Academy ===\n\nKenneth Force served as band director at the United States Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA) in Kings Point, New York, United States from 1971 to 2016, a period of over 45 years. Consisting entirely of midshipmen, Force led the band to perform in the British style.\nUnder Force's leadership, the United States Merchant Marine Academy Regimental Band played atop the Brooklyn Bridge for its 100th anniversary, at Miss America pageant parades, on field during a World Series, in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, and at the U.S. Open after 9/11. The band also played aboard the ocean liner Queen Elizabeth 2 when it carried World War II veterans to Normandy in 1994 for the 50th anniversary of D-Day. In June, 2000, Captain Force's USMMA Regimental Band flew to New Orleans, Louisiana to represent the United States Merchant Marine Academy and the United States Merchant Marine for the opening of the National World War II Museum.\n\nIn 1989, Captain Kenneth Force was interviewed by Fred McMorrow of the New York Times.  In describing Captain Force's speech pattern, McMorrow observed, \"He talks at up tempo, but you can understand every word.\". In the interview, Captain Force described the difference between circus music and the music of British marching bands.  He described circus music as having a musical \"Merle Evans\" \"gallop\", with a tempo described as \"insane.\"  Force related, \"There are more than 300 numbers in the circus and fast changes all the time if something goes wrong with an act.\" By comparison, Force described British band style as \"'a moving organ\" with \"swagger\" and drums in the front to signal for change in course, the same as a sailing ship in battle with drums that could be heard above the guns.\nIn the 1990s, Captain Force's campaign to save the Kings Point, Long Island home of George M. Cohan preserved the property, and won landmark status for the 65,000 square foot estate. Following the effort, in 1999 the United States Merchant Marine Academy Regimental Band was bestowed with the title \"George M. Cohan's Own\" by Cohan's family.\nIn 2005, Captain Force successfully campaigned to erect a statue of John Philip Sousa at the Marine Barracks Annex in Washington, DC.\n\nForce led the band to perform in numerous presidential inauguration parades, at which the band would traditionally perform the 19th century march, \"A Life on the Ocean Wave.\". While serving as band director at the United States Merchant Marine Academy, Captain Force led the Academy regimental band in the inaugural parades of Presidents Nixon (President Nixon's second inaugural parade), Carter, Reagan (two inaugurations, the second parade canceled due to cold weather), George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton (two inaugural parades), and George W. Bush (two inaugural parades).. For the inaugural parades of President Obama, Captain Force's health left him unable to physically march with the band, and he watched from the sidelines. At each inaugural parade, the USMMA regimental band played, \"A Life on the Ocean Wave\", which became its tradition.\n\n\n== Other activities ==\nKenneth Force served as consultant to Columbia Artists Management for seven British military band tours of North America.  He co-produced the “British Salute to the U.S. Bicentennial Tattoo” in Newport, Rhode Island, featuring Her Majesty's Royal Marines, the Black Watch, and the Royal Highland Regiment, with a cast of over 5,000.\n\n\n== Compositions ==\nKenneth Force wrote numerous musical compositions.  These included:\n\n“A Cantata on George Washington’s Inauguration in 1789.”\n''Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Cantata,'' which took eleven months to compose, premiered at the United States Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, NY in February 1990, commissioned by the State Commission on the Bicentennial Celebration of the United States Constitution, resulting in a seven-movement work for mixed chorus and symphonic band requiring fifty minutes to perform\n\"The First Lady March\", a march for the First Lady, written for Hillary Clinton\n\"Presidential Pets March\", a march for presidential pets\nFor the 100th anniversary of Grant's Tomb, Force re-scored the music of Ulysses S. Grant’s inauguration so it could be played by modern instruments.\n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\nKenneth Force was elected to honorary membership in the American Bandmasters Association (2004), an organization founded by John Philip Sousa and Edwin Franko Goldman.\nForce served as president of the board of directors for the Goldman Memorial Band at Damrosch Park.\nForce conducted the Royal Marine Band in Rotterdam\nForce conducted the Royal Military Band in the Hague\nForce conducted the Band of Her Majesty's Welsh Guards\nIn 2002, Captain Kenneth Force, USMS was named an honorary alumnus of the United States Merchant Marine Academy.\nForce was recognized with a Lifetime Achievement Award from Long Island's Usdan Center for the Creative and Performing Arts.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nKenneth Force was married to Catherine Sloan, Barbara Hopkins, and Marilyn Uribe in marriages that ended in divorce.  At the time of his death, he was survived by a stepson and two grandchildren.\n\n\n== Death ==\nIn Force's final years, his former students from Port Chester High School provided medical and legal oversight, residential assistance, and support.  Kenneth Force was reported to have died on October 7, 2023, in Rye, New York at the age of 83.  Marianne Lepre, a former student, reported that respiratory failure resulting from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was the cause of his death at a long-term nursing facility.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nC-Span coverage of the USMMA regimental band performing at an inauguration parade. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J_7otAiQWA\nThe USMMA regimental band performing \"A Life on the Ocean Wave.\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a_7SxydC00",

        "content": "Mary Cranston Mason (1846–1932) was a Scottish hotelier, social reformer, and temperance leader. She served as President of the Ladies' Auxiliary of the Scottish Permissive Bill and Temperance Association and was a prominent member of the Glasgow school board, where she assured that temperance lessons were included in the curriculum. At the same time, Mason also managed Cranston's Waverley Temperance Hotel in Glasgow.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMary Cranston was born in Edinburgh on 22 April 1846. She was a daughter of Bailie Robert Cranston (1815–1892), of Edinburgh, who was one of the temperance pioneers of Scotland, and his first wife, Elizabeth Dalgleish. Robert's cousin, George Cranston, was the father of Kate Cranston, a leading figure in the development of tea rooms in Scotland. Sir Robert Cranston, who served as Lord provost of Edinburgh, was Mary's brother. \n\n\n== Career ==\nOn 12 June 1872 she  married George Mason, a Glasgow merchant. In that city, she managed \"Cranston's Waverley Temperance Hotel\".\nBorn in the atmosphere of total abstinence and of organized opposition to the liquor traffic, Mason came by inheritance into those convictions and activities which led the Scottish women into a concerted temperance movement. She was a co-founder of the Ladies' Auxiliary of the Scottish Permissive Bill and Temperance Association. After serving in different capacities, she became president of that organization in 1903. Under the auspices of the Auxiliary, social meetings were held in the schools every winter that included instructive programs regarding the ill-effects of alcohol use. With Mason at its head, the Auxiliary took an active part in all the local and national movements by which Scotland participated in temperance reform.\nFor a still longer period, she was a prominent member of the Glasgow school board, having supervision of the temperance lessons taught in every school within the board's authority. Mason served, too, on the Juvenile Delinquency Board.\n\n\n== Death ==\nMary Cranston Mason died in 1932.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Elżbieta Dorota Gawin-Knaga (known professionally as Ela Gawin) (born June 19, 1970) is a Polish photographer, online personality and content creator. She is most known for her controversial livestreams and photography ventures, which include accusations of intellectual property theft and an ongoing custody battle for her underaged child.\n\n\n== Early and personal life ==\nElżbieta Gawin was born on June 19, 1970, in Kraków, Poland. She attended primary and secondary school (Bartłomiej Nowodworski High School) in the same city. Gawin got married to a pastry chef, Andrzej Knaga, in 2007, and subsequently divorced him in 2012. She has one child, a minor daughter born in 2010, and claims to have miscarried twice before the birth of her daughter.\nHer father was an acclaimed Polish geophysicist, Adam Gawin; he has gained widespread attention on the internet thanks to his daughter, who frequently mentions him in her livestreams, either praising him or accusing him of various wrongdoings. This has sparked discussions about his scientific work outside of academic circles. Gawin has been dubbed \"córa belwederska\" (Belvedere daughter) by her fans because she often emphasizes his professorial status. In Poland, the title of professor is bestowed upon individuals with a habilitated doctorate for their exceptional scientific or artistic accomplishments. Since this title is conferred by the President of Poland, and the ceremony often occurs at the Belvedere Palace, recipients are colloquially referred to as \"Belvedere professors\" in informal settings.\n\n\n== Education ==\nShe is a graduate of Polish Studies at the Faculty of Humanities of the Jagiellonian University in Kraków (majoring in Film Studies). She released a scan of her diploma online, and it was quickly discovered by her fans that she doctored the image by changing her final grade from 3 (Polish: dostateczny lit. 'satisfactory') to 5 (Polish: bardzo dobry lit. 'very good')\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Photography and modelling ===\nGawin owned a photography atelier on the Kraków's main square, however due to cost of the rent she moved it into her private apartment. She is often criticised due to the quality of her work and some photographers accused Gawin of allegedly stealing their intellectual property and claiming pictures taken by other professionals are actually hers. Gawin also ventured into dog breeding and advertised Tatra Shepherd puppies on her website as photography props. Gawin, apart from being a photographer, worked as a photo model and a movie extra, her most notable credit being a cameo as a Jewish secretary in Schindler's List.\n\n\n=== YouTube ===\nGawin has several YouTube channels, including one named after her daughter, the main one being Ela Gawin. She livestreams frequently and posts vlogs featuring her daily life; in the years past, her minor daughter was often heavily featured. Her content if often described as disturbing, since Gawin consumes alcohol during livestreams, goes into offensive tirades against police, judges, Polish justice system in general, the current political situation in Poland, and apparent “communist occupation of Poland”. She often claims to be a devout Catholic and a conservative, a voter of Law and Justice political party, although she questions the Catholic dogma occasionally and has mentioned being bisexual. Gawin became a so-called lolcow, and an internet phenomenon, causing a lot of content covering her online activity being produced by other online creators.\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nIn 2018, Gawin ran for a district councilor in the city of Kraków, receiving in total 7 votes (2.41%).\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nGawin's daughter, Maria, was taken into protective custody in November 2022 due to Gawin featuring her excessively during livestreams and vlogs, releasing sensitive information about the child, including her private phone number, address of residence, age, PESEL number, location of her school and schedule, agreeing to allow strange men to interact with her child for money, and calling upon another YouTube personality, rapper Psychotrop, to kill both of them during a recorded phone call. Upon Gawin's temporary arrest, Janusz Hnatko, spokesman for the District Prosecutor's Office in Kraków, claimed in a statement to the media that proceedings are being conducted against Gawin in connection with online activities, i.e. a crime under article 252 par. 2 of the Polish Penal Code. These provisions state that “whoever takes or holds a hostage in order to force a state or local government body, institution, organization, a natural or legal person or a group of persons to behave in a specific manner, shall be subject to the penalty of imprisonment for a period of not less than three years.” The second paragraph adds that if this act “involves particular torment of the hostage, the perpetrator shall be subject to the penalty of deprivation of liberty for a period of not less than five years or the penalty of deprivation of liberty for 25 years.”\nIn another phone call from 2024, Gawin admitted to purchasing alcohol and e-cigarettes for her minor daughter when the child was already under protective custody. Since mid-2022, her apartment if often raided by the police during livestreams due to Gawin causing disturbances, talking about suicidal ideation and releasing information about her minor daughter's whereabouts while in protective custody.\nGawin repeatedly reports in great detail the nuances of the custody battle, including her psychiatric evaluations, court hearings and such, describing the separation of her child from her as a punishment for being a conservative, aimed at her daughter rather than Gawin herself. A psychological evaluation of her and her ex-husband, commissioned by the District court for the city of Kraków, was leaked; in it Gawin was described as severely lacking in child-rearing skills. As of April 2024, the court proceedings remain ongoing.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jeremiah S. Gutman (c. 1924 – February 25, 2004) was an American civil rights lawyer and founding member of the New York Civil Liberties Union.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGutman served in World War II as a corporal in the 2nd platoon, Company G of the 273rd Infantry Regiment in the 69th Infantry Division, receiving a Purple Heart. During the 1948 Palestine war, he collected light arms to smuggle to the Haganah. \nAs a student at the New York University School of Law, Gutman edited the New York University Law Review. In 1949, he joined the law firm Levy, Gutman, Goldberg & Kaplan, where his father was a partner. In 1951, hoping to combat McCarthyism, Gutman became a founding member of the New York Civil Liberties Union. \nOver the course of his career, Gutman litigated many civil rights cases, with prominent clients including Abbie Hoffman, Douglas Faneuil, Jerry Rubin, and conscientious objectors to the Vietnam War. He also defended cult leaders such as Sun Myung Moon and leaders of the Hare Krishna movement; sociologist Stjepan Meštrović described Gutman as \"sympathetic to cult movements, express[ing] regret that the First Amendment is not applied vigorously to defend them, and refer[ring] to 'deprogramming' as a 'dirty business'\".\nIn 2001, Gutman became the chair of the National Coalition Against Censorship, where he had served as an officer since the 1980s. He became president of Meretz USA in the same year. Gutman died from a heart attack on February 25, 2004.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Come Tumbling Down is a 2020 fantasy novella by American author Seanan McGuire. It is the fifth book in the Wayward Children series and focuses on the Wolcott twins, who were centered in the first book in the series (Every Heart a Doorway) and the second (Down Among the Sticks and Bones). This time, the children from the School for Wayward Children must venture into the Moors to save Jack Wolcott and the Moors themselves.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nCome Tumbling Down begins at Eleanor West's School for Wayward Children as sparks of lightning strike in the basement, bringing to life a door through which a teenaged girl steps, another girl in her arms. Soon, the children learn that the injured girl is Jack Wolcott, a former schoolmate, and the girl carrying her is her beloved Alexis from the Moors, a world filled with vampires, werewolves, mad scientists, and other monsters. The children soon learn that Jill sought out revenge after Jack killed previously killed her to end a Jill's murderous rampage in Every Heart a Doorway. Though Jack, who apprenticed with a mad scientist in the Moors, was able to bring Jill back to life, Jill would no longer be eligible to become a vampire as she had dreamed. However, because Jack's body had never died, her body could still become vampiric. As such, Jill concocted and carried out a plan to switch her body with Jack's. This distresses Jack not only because she doesn't want her body defiled by vampirism but also because her obsessive–compulsive disorder is in overdrive living in her sister's body.\nIn hopes of returning to the girls to their rightful bodies and saving the Moors, the children venture into the Moors.\n\n\n== Major themes ==\nCome Tumbling Down explores various themes. Both Booklist and Library Journal discussed the novel's exploration regarding the themes of \"dysphoria and gender\", in large part because two of the book's characters spend much of the book living in the other's body, causing distress.\nFurther, Kirkus Reviews highlighted an ongoing theme in the Wayward Children series regarding how \"one’s real or perceived flaws can prove to be a source of strength despite, or even because of, the pain they cause to oneself and others.\"\nAccording to Publishers Weekly, the novels also explores the themes of \"sacrifice, love, and hope\". \n\n\n== Reception ==\nCome Tumbling Down received starred reviews from Kirkus Reviews and Library Journal.\nPublishers Weekly referred to the novel as a \"grim yet achingly tender tale\".\nMultiple reviewers discussed McGuire's skill as a writer. Library Journal's Kristi Chadwick generally spotlighted \"McGuire’s rich prose\", while Booklist's Regina Schroeder highlighted the novel's \"magnificent worlds\" and \"wonderful variety of characters\". Kirkus Reviews praised McGuire's ability to \"lending equal richness to her worldbuilding and her characterizations\", comparing the Moors to the worlds and fantasies concocted by Bram Stoker (Dracula), Mary Shelley (Frankenstein), and H. P. Lovecraft.  They also noted that the characters feel like \"real people dumped into fantastical situations\" with a \"thin line separating heroes from monsters\".\nAudioFile reviewed the audiobook, referring to the author's reading as \"serviceable\". They highlighted McGuire's strength narrating the \"dialogue, as she allows the characters' tenderness and tenacity to come through\". However, they noted that \"she reads at such an accelerated pace that listeners may not be able to truly savor the lush beauty of her prose\".\nLocus included Come Tumbling Down on their list of the best science fiction novellas of 2020. The novel was also nominated for the 2020 Hugo Award for Best Novella and World Fantasy Award for Novella. \n\n\n== References ==",

They are scheduled to play two 50-over matches at The Gnoll in Neath for the third year in a row, while also not returning to Penrhyn Avenue in Rhos-on-Sea for the fifth year in a row.\nIt was the team's first season with Grant Bradburn as their head coach and Sam Northeast as red-ball captain, following the departures of red-ball coach Matthew Maynard and captain David Lloyd. White-ball coach Mark Alleyne also left, allowing Bradburn to unite the roles held by Maynard and Alleyne, while Kiran Carlson was appointed as white-ball captain, taking T20 duties in addition to the 50-over role he already held.

        "content": "Fly Me to the Moon (Chinese: 但願人長久) is a 2023 Hong Kong family drama film directed and written by Sasha Chuk, and produced by Stanley Kwan and Jun Li. Chuk also stars in a lead role, alongside Angela Yuen and Wu Kang-ren, as a Hunanese girl immigrated to Hong Kong at a young age and faces poverty, discrimination and family issues.\nThe film had its world premiere at the 36th Tokyo International Film Festival on October 23, 2023, and was theatrically released on April 11, 2024, in Hong Kong. It received six nominations in the 30th Hong Kong Film Critics Society Award, with Sasha Chuk winning Best Screenplay and Wu Kang-ren winning Best Actor.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nIn 1997, Lam Tsz Yuen, a seven-year-old Hunanese girl, migrates to Hong Kong with her mother to reunite with her father, Kok Man, who had previously smuggled into Hong Kong and became a thief. However, due to her status as a mainland immigrant, she faces bullying at school and has a difficult childhood. One day, Yuen's father notices her eyeing for a pack of candy and steals it from a store for her. Influenced by her father, Yuen steals a watch from a classmate but is discovered by her mother. Enraged, Yuen's mother blames Kok Man for his bad influence on Yuen due to his stealing and continuous drug use. The tension between Kok Man and his wife eases when Yuen's younger sister, Lam Tsz Kuet, also migrates to Hong Kong and reunites with the family. However, their happiness is short-lived as Kok Man is arrested for theft, leaving his wife to raise their two daughters alone for the next ten years while he is in jail.\nIn 2007, Kok Man is released from prison. Yuen and Kuet have already learned Cantonese and integrated well at school. Yuen has to work part-time to earn money and enters into a relationship with a bad boy named Sky who steals candy for her from a convenience store. Meanwhile, Kuet witnesses her classmates discriminating against and bullying a mainland immigrant classmate. Fearing being looked down upon by her peers, Kuet steals money from her sister to buy new trousers for a school trip. When Yuen discovers her money being stolen, she immediately accuses her father of taking it. This leads to a heated argument between Kok Man and Yuen. Although Kuet later reveals the truth and apologizes to her sister, the relationship between Yuen and Kok Man deteriorates. Yuen also has a falling out with Sky and breaks up with him due to her insecurities. Kok Man visits his long-time drug addict friend, Fai, only to find him dead. With his drug supply cut off, Kok Man resorts to attempting to steal his family's valuables in front of Kuet to fund his purchase of drugs. Kuet tries to call her sister but is forcefully stopped by Kok Man. However, when Kok Man sees the fear on Kuet's face, he backs down, feels remorse, and breaks down in tears. Yuen returns home but ignores her father. Caught between the two, Kuet asks Yuen to lend her money, which she gives to Kok Man to help him fulfill his addiction. Kok Man leaves a note for Yuen, promising to return the money soon.\nIn 2017, Kok Man is incarcerated once again, and Kuet visits him in jail. Yuen becomes a tour guide and enters into a friends-with-benefits relationship with a Taiwanese man named Xiao Yu in Japan. While at an izakaya, she is flirted with by a Japanese man, which is discovered by Xiao Yu. Yuen clarifies to Xiao Yu that their relationship is casual and eventually breaks up with him. Upon returning to Hong Kong from her trip, Yuen receives an invitation from Kuet to have dinner with their father. Initially hesitant, Yuen still shows up but remains taciturn during the gathering. Later, when Yuen goes to visit Kuet, she encounters Kok Man near their house. After all these years, the duo finally starts breaking the ice and chatting. Kok Man informs Yuen of his decision to return to Hunan and invites her to visit their homeland during the blooming season of lilies. Soon after, Yuen receives the news of Kok Man's death, prompting her to return to Hunan to visit her relatives on behalf of her father. Finally, Yuen receives a voice recording of Kok Man from Kuet, where he expresses his desire to have another meal with her.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nSasha Chuk as Lam Tsz Yuen: a Hunan native who migrated to Hong Kong to reunite with her father and encounters challenges such as poverty, discrimination, and family issues.\nChloe Hui and Yoyo Tse portrayed younger versions of Yuen in 1997 and 2007\nAngela Yuen as Lam Tsz Kuet: Yuen's younger sister who also migrated to Hong Kong and works hard to adapt to the city.\nSkylar Pang and Natalie Hsu portrayed younger versions of Kuet in 1997 and 2007\nWu Kang-ren as Lam Kok Man: the father of Yuen and Kuet, who smuggled into Hong Kong to escape poverty but ends up becoming a drug addict and thief.\nAlso appearing in the film are Carmen Chou as Yuen and Kuet's mother; Chu Pak Hong as Fai, a drug-addict friend and fellow thief with Kok Man; Wu Chien-ho as Xiao Yu, a friend with benefits of Yuen; and Wong Tsz Ho as Sky, Yuen's first love.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nIn 2017, Chinese literature graduate Sasha Chuk published a semi-autobiographical novella Farewell of Summer based on her personal experience as a mainland native who immigrated to Hong Kong when she was six years old. She began adapting her book into a screenplay while filming the short film Plain Sailing, and was encouraged by producer Jun Li to take on the lead acting role simultaneously. In 2020, Chuk applied for the Hong Kong Film Development Council's First Feature Film Initiative and received funding of HK$5 million. The film then underwent approximately three years of pre-production. Chuk also served as the film's director, marking her directorial, scriptwriting, and acting debut in a feature film. Taiwanese actor Wu Kang-ren was attached to the project in the early stages of casting, on the recommendation of Li to Chuk when Chuk was looking for a non-Cantonese native-speaking actor. Wu accepted the role right after finishing the shooting of Abang Adik and spent four months residing in Hong Kong to familiarize himself with the traits of Hong Kongers. The film was enlisted in the Hong Kong - Asia Film Financing Forum in March 2023, and was selected on the Golden Horse Film Project Promotion in September 2023.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nPrincipal photography began in July 2022. Filming was intended to take place in Hong Kong and Tokyo, but due to budget constraints, Chuk was only able to afford a four-member production crew while filming in Japan, and some scenes had to be rewritten to film in Taiwan. Chuk also served as the Hunanese tutor on set. Filming ultimately wrapped in December 2022.\n\n\n== Release ==\nFly Me to the Moon had its world premiere at the Asian Future section of the 36th Tokyo International Film Festival on October 24, 2023. The film was also selected as the closing film of the Hong Kong Asian Film Festival on November 12, 2023, and was theatrically released in Hong Kong on April 11, 2024.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nEdmund Lee of South China Morning Post gave the film 4/5 stars and lauded Sasha Chuk's talent as a screenwriter, director, and actress, with a fragmented yet grounded narrative and powerful performances, but noting that the serene approach may not resonate with the mainstream Hong Kong audience despite addressing various social issues. Wendy Ide of Screen Daily described the film as an affecting and hard-edged domestic saga, marking director Sasha Chuk as a name to watch, with a focus on the impact of the father's sins on his daughters, although the film's use of music is slightly jarring and tonally inconsistent with its brooding and complex exploration of family bonds. Keith Ho, writing for HK01, praised the poignant portrayal of Hong Kong's transformation over the past twenty years, drawing from Sasha Chuk's own experiences, while also highlighting the excellent performances of the cast, particularly Wu Kang-ren, and the film's clever use of different time periods as a storytelling device to portray complex family bonds. Hsiao Yun of United Daily News emphasized Sasha Chuk's exploration of identity, social structure, and the experiences of new immigrants in Hong Kong through the characters, ultimately highlighting the protagonist's journey towards a multifaceted sense of self.\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFly Me to the Moon at IMDb",

It has a length of 521 meters. After its completion, vehicles no longer need to traverse the outer section of the Qingshui Cliffs.\nOn the night of January 11, 2023, at 11:55 P.M., due to previous seismic loosening and rainfall, the upper slope of the tunnel at the south entrance of the Dachinshui Tunnel at kilometer 159+300 of Provincial Highway 9 collapsed. Fractured rock blocks fell from a height of over 30 meters, with an impact momentum exceeding the tolerance of the tunnel, crushing a 17-meter-long concrete tunnel and an 8-meter-long steel-structured tunnel, causing a total damage length of about 25 meters and an estimated collapse volume of about 1200 cubic meters, resulting in the destruction of the tunnel and road obstruction, rendering it impassable in both directions. In the subsequent long-term plan, this section has been included in the Suhua Safety Plan. A tunnel of approximately 10 kilometers is planned to be expedited, and the comprehensive planning has been completed and submitted for departmental review, with an environmental impact assessment scheduled to be submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency by the end of the year.\nOn April 3, 2024, during the April 2024 Hualien earthquake, the Xiaqingshui Bridge at the north entrance of the tunnel was damaged by falling rocks, resulting in the complete closure of the Su-Hua Highway.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nQingshui Cliff",

        "content": "Hoboken Saturday Night is the second and final album by the American band the Insect Trust, released in 1970. The band supported the album by playing the Memphis Country Blues Festival, which was first organized by band member Bill Barth in 1966.\nHoboken Saturday Night is regarded as a cult classic. It was reissued in 2004, owing to the advocacy of Robert Christgau, who also contributed new liner notes.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe album was produced by Steve Duboff. It is in part a tribute to Hoboken, New Jersey, where the bandmembers lived due to the inexpensive rents, blue-collar vibe, and proximity to Manhattan. Elvin Jones played drums on a couple of the tracks. \"The Eyes of a New York Woman\" is a rerecording of a 1968 single by the Primitives, an early incarnation of the band; the lyrics were taken without permission from Thomas Pynchon's V. Pynchon had sued the band, but allowed them to use the lyrics for the album release. \"Be a Hobo\" is a version of the Moondog composition. \"Mr. Garfield\" is a version of the song often credited to Ramblin' Jack Elliott.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nRobert Christgau wrote that \"these passionate humanists ... sound friendly and have come up with a charming, joyous, irrepressibly experimental record\"; in his obituary for band member Robert Palmer, he dubbed it a \"great lost hippie album.\" The Courier Journal said that \"the record is a romping, stomping wonder that breaks all the guitars-bass-and-drums shackles the Beatles put on contemporary music.\" A syndicated column in the Times-News opined that vocalist Nancy Jeffries \"just might be the best pop singer in the country,\" and noted that the album is \"full of dusty, cobwebbed corners of music that no one has poked into in years.\"\nRolling Stone stated that the Insect Trust \"explored rock's fundamental cross-currents—holy-rolling and fieldhand blues, dirt-road country and the freewheeling joys of early and modern jazz—with invention and pop acumen.\" The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music concluded that \"overall the collection lacked the element of surprise which made the group's debut so spellbinding.\" AllMusic determined that they \"touched upon facets of the singer/songwriter, psychedelic, and folk-rock subgenres, while somehow eluding them all.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

VESO connects Port customers to the Union Pacific Railroad.\n\n\n== History ==\nVerdigris Southern Railroad, L.L.C. was created in Delaware on November 16, 2021, and then qualified to do business in Oklahoma.  It is owned by Watco.  VESO's purpose is to be a common carrier railroad to connect Tulsa Port of Inola businesses with an interchange with the Union Pacific at Inola, Oklahoma.  Watco indicates the line is about 3.3 miles in length.An abandoned rail line provided the trackage, which was rehabilitated for under $20 million.  The project included funding from Port resident Sofidel and the United States Department of Transportation.  The Port owns the trackage, which is then leased to VESO.The line became operational in April 2024 with Sofidel, a tissue paper company, being the initial customer, and the primary commodity transported being raw pulp.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Agglomerate is a material composed of iron oxides and gangue, roasted and sintered in an agglomeration plant. This product is obtained by burning coal previously mixed with iron ore and oxides. This conditioning of iron ore optimizes its use in the blast furnace.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe advantages of agglomeration were identified very early on, but the processes used at the time were not continuous. The primitive method, which consisted of a grindstone grate, was abandoned towards the end of the 19th century because it was too fuel-intensive. Shaft furnaces then replaced them, their much higher efficiency being due both to the confinement of the reaction and to counter-current operation (the solids sink and the gases rise).\nIn these furnaces, iron ores were roasted to obtain the opposite result to the one we're looking for now: in 1895, roasting was carried out at low temperatures to avoid aggregation, and to obtain friable ore.\nAt the time, ore roasting furnaces were tanks inspired by blast furnaces and lime kilns, and were not very productive tools. Around 1910, the Greenawald process, which automated the principle3, saw some development, enabling the production of 300,000 tonnes a year.\nIn June 1906, A.S. Dwight and R. L. Lloyd built the first agglomerating machine on a chain (also known as a grate), which began agglomerating copper and lead ores. The first agglomeration line for iron ores was built in 1910 in Birdsboro, Pennsylvania.\nIt took some thirty years for the sintering of ores on chains to become widespread in the steel industry. Whereas before the Second World War, it was mainly used for reconditioning ore fines, after 1945 it became widespread for processing raw ores. Today, it plays an essential role in the blending of different ores and, above all, in the incorporation of mineral wastes of varying iron content. This recycling role improves profitability and limits the amount of waste generated by steel complexes, which generate numerous iron-rich residues (slag, sludge, dust, etc.).\n\n\n== Interests and limitations ==\n\n\n=== Interests ===\nChipboard is a product optimized for use in blast furnaces. To do so, it must meet several conditions:\n\nbe composed of a gangue of oxides which, combined with the ash from coke combustion (essentially silica), will give rise to a fusible slag which is both reactive towards impurities (in particular the sulfur provided by the coke), not very aggressive towards the refractories lining the blast furnace and of a quality suitable for its use;\nEnsure a precise particle size, generally between 20 and 80 mm (pieces that are too small clog up the furnace, and pieces that are too large take too long to transform in the core);\nmaintain permeability to reducing gases at the highest possible temperatures;\nlow-temperature endothermic reactions that can be carried out more economically outside a blast furnace. These are essentially drying, calcination of the gangue (decarbonisation of limestone and dehydration of clay or gypsum), and reduction reactions. The agglomerate then becomes, at equal weight, richer in iron than the ore.\nover oxidize iron oxides, Fe2O3 being better reduced by the carbon monoxide present in the blast furnace than less oxidized compounds, especially Fe3O4.\nAnother advantage is the elimination of undesirable elements: the chain agglomeration process eliminates 80-95% of the sulfur present in the ore and its additives. It's also a way of getting rid of zinc, the element that \"poisons\" blast furnaces, as its vaporization temperature of 907°C corresponds to that of a well-conducted roast.\n\n\n=== Limitations ===\nOn the other hand, agglomerate is an abrasive product that damages blast furnace vessels, especially if these are not designed for absorber, and is above all fragile. Repeated handling degrades its grain size and generates fines, making it unsuitable for packaging at sites far from blast furnaces: pellets are therefore preferable. Cold resistance, particularly to crushing, can be improved by increasing the energy input during sintering.\nImproving mechanical strength also improves the performance of agglomerates in the processes that use them. The reduction of hematite (Fe2O3) to magnetite (Fe3O4) creates internal stresses. However, in addition to increasing the cost of agglomerate production, reducibility deteriorates when mechanical strength is sought.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nAgglomerates are generally classified as acidic or basic. The complete basicity index ic is calculated by the following ratio of mass concentrations:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          I\n          \n            c\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              [\n              C\n              a\n              O\n              ]\n              +\n              [\n              M\n              g\n              O\n              ]\n            \n            \n              [\n              S\n              i\n              \n                O\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n              ]\n              +\n              [\n              A\n              \n                l\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n              \n                O\n                \n                  3\n                \n              \n              ]\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle I_{c}={\\frac {[CaO]+[MgO]}{[SiO_{2}]+[Al_{2}O_{3}]}}}\n  \n\nIt is often simplified by simply calculating a simplified basicity index noted i (or sometimes ia), equal to the ratio CaO / SiO2. An agglomerate with an index ic of less than 1 is said to be acidic; above 1, it is generally said to be basic; equal to 1, it is said to be self-melting (ic=1 being equivalent to ia=1.40). Before the 1950s, agglomerates with an ic value of less than 0.5 were in the majority. Then, when it was realized that agglomerate could incorporate limestone, which was then charged into the blast furnace separately, basic indices became widespread: in 1965, indices below 0.5 represented less than 15% of the tonnage of agglomerate produced, while basic agglomerates accounted for 45%.\nAgain, we find the relationship: \n  \n    \n      \n        \n           \n          \n            i\n            \n              b\n            \n          \n          =\n          \n            \n              \n                [\n                C\n                a\n                O\n                ]\n                +\n                k\n                ⋅\n                [\n                M\n                g\n                O\n                ]\n              \n              \n                [\n                S\n                i\n                \n                  O\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                ]\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle \\ i_{b}={\\frac {[CaO]+k\\cdot [MgO]}{[SiO_{2}]}}}\n  \n k being an empirically determined constant (sometimes equal, for simplicity, to 1). Iron reduction is, in itself, favored by a basic environment, and peaks at 2<ib<2.5. It is also in this range that mechanical strength is best (and also, the slag's fusibility is the worst, which complicates its removal from the blast furnace). Above an ib value of 2.6, the proportion of molten agglomerate increases, clogging the pores and slowing down chemical reactions between gases and oxides. As for acid agglomerates with an ib index of less than 1, softening begins as soon as only around 15% of the ore has been reduced.\nThe optimum basicity index is therefore determined according to the ore used, the technical characteristics of the blast furnace, the intended use of the cast iron and the desired qualities. For example:\n\nCast irons made from Minette (ore) and intended for refining using the Thomas process had basicities of i=1.35 (a complete index I=1), which was a compromise between low-temperature viscosity (which requires an acidic slag) and desulfurization (favored by a basic slag);\nplants for which sulfur-rich cast iron is not a problem adopt a more acidic agglomerate: with i= 0.9 to 1.0. This favors silicon reduction but can result in very high sulfur contents, from 0.1 to 0.25%;\nthe production of ferromanganese in the blast furnace requires a high manganese yield and therefore high basicities, up to i = 1.7 or 1.8 (bearing in mind that in this particular case, the index corresponds to \n  \n    \n      \n        \n           \n          i\n          =\n          \n            \n              \n                [\n                C\n                a\n                O\n                ]\n                +\n                [\n                M\n                g\n                O\n                ]\n                +\n                [\n                B\n                a\n                O\n                ]\n              \n              \n                [\n                S\n                i\n                \n                  O\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                ]\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle \\ i={\\frac {[CaO]+[MgO]+[BaO]}{[SiO_{2}]}}}\n  \n!). Meltability is a secondary consideration in this case, as slag temperatures can reach 1,650°C (instead of 1,450°C - 1,550°C in the production of cast irons for refining).\n\n\n== See also ==\nSpeiss\nSinter plant\nAgglomerate\n\n\n== References ==\n\nLedebur, Adolf.

His follow-up single Music Is The Drug, also released in 2002, received a 4* review in Muzik magazine with journalist Mark Kavanagh stating it had \"pounding bass and beats topped with rattling percussion and abrasive synths driving you to the superb, lush breakdown\". It peaked at number 14 in the UK Dance chart.  In 2005 the Tidy Euphoria compilation album was released.  Mixed by Haslam, Amber D, and the Tidy Boys, it reached number 10 in the UK compilation chart. In 2016 Haslam collaborated with Peter Berry to release the single State of Mind on the Tidy Two label, which MixMag reviewed as \"the energy is outstanding\". From 2002 Haslam has been involved in producing and guiding the Resonate - The Brutal Sound of Hard Trance compilation album series.\nIn 2004 Haslam performed a BBC Radio 1 live Essential Mix alongside the Tidy Boys and Judge Jules.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nLee Haslam discography at Discogs \nLee Haslam at AllMusic",

        "content": "In an Absent Dream is a 2019 fantasy novella by American author Seanan McGuire. It is the fourth book in the Wayward Children series and follows  Lundy, the in-house therapist at Eleanor West's School for Wayward Children.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn an Absent Dream introduces Katherine Lundy, a quiet, polite young girl growing up in the 1960s. Katherine is the daughter of her school's principal, and between that and her bookishness, she hasn't many friends. On the last day of school, when she is eight years old, she fails to rejoice with the other children when the school bell rings. Instead, she remains in the classroom reading. After the teacher forces her to leave, Katherine walks home, her feet carrying her as she keeps her nose in her book--that is, until she comes upon a tree where a tree shouldn't be, which provides a door to an unusual world: the Goblin Market. \nIn the Goblin Market, everything is bartered based on what may be considered \"fair value\", recognizing that what may be fair to one person is not fair to another, as the Archivist informs Katherine. Upon arrival, the Archivist informs Katherine of the rules, including that \"names have power\", which prompts Katherine to then go by \"Lundy\". \nUnlike other worlds where people from our world can only come and go once, children may leave the Goblin Market and return multiple times until they turn 18. By the time they turn 18, they will not be permitted to stay in the Market unless they have completed the citizenship ceremony, at which point they will not be able to return to the world in which they were born. \nFrom the age of 8 until her teenage years, Lundy travels back and forth from the Goblin Market to the place of her birth, always thinking of the Market as home with its strict sense of logic and her best friend, Moon. However, as she approaches her 18th birthday, she faces a choice that results in the Lundy readers meet in the series's first book, Every Heart a Doorway.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn a starred review, Kirkus Reviews indicated that \"Lundy’s adventures will feel sadly inevitable to readers of the previous books in the series, [...] but readers will assuredly not regret going on this journey\". They further highlighted how McGuire \"beautifully portrays the overwhelming experience of being on the threshold of maturity, convinced (sometimes correctly, unfortunately) that the choices one makes now will affect one’s entire adult life, struggling to balance obligations to oneself and to others, and feeling paralyzed on that brink.\"\nBooklist's Regina Schroeder called In an Absent Dream \"a lovely installment of the series, with pitch-perfect fairy-tale logic\". Schroeder also noted that the whole series, including this installment, \"has wonderful, internally consistent world building and characters, no matter how far in the background, with complexity and depth\".\nAudioFile reviewed the audiobook, writing, \"Cynthia Hopkins narrates this fantasy in a detached tone that fits the serious and logical perspective of Katherine Lundy\".\nIn 2020, In an Absent Dream was a finalist for the Hugo Award for Best Novella and the World Fantasy Award for Novella.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "David Moreno Ramos (born 1979 or 1980) is a Spanish Vox politician. He has served on the city council in his hometown of Talavera de la Reina since 2019, being deputy mayor since 2023. He was Vox's lead candidate in the 2023 Castilian-Manchegan regional election, in which his party entered the Cortes of Castilla–La Mancha.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMoreno was born in Talavera de la Reina, Province of Toledo, as the youngest of six children. He graduated in law and business management from the Alfonso X El Sabio University in Madrid. After six years of study in the capital city, he returned home to work as a businessman.\nMoreno joined Vox in 2018 and became vice president of their organisation in his native province in 2020. In April 2019, he was chosen as Vox's candidate for mayor of Talavera in July's local elections. His party entered the council with three seats. In 2023, Vox took four seats and the People's Party (PP) took nine, allowing them to form a coalition and remove the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) from power; José Julián Gregorio of the PP became mayor and Moreno the deputy mayor.\nMoreno was chosen in December 2022 as Vox's lead candidate in the 2023 Castilian-Manchegan regional election. He ran on a platform with a focus on strengthening the rural economy and using financial incentives to combat depopulation in the remote region. Vox entered the Cortes of Castilla–La Mancha with four seats, but combined with the PP's 12, fell one seat short of removing the PSOE from power.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAs of 2022, Moreno is married and has three children. He is a fan of bullfighting and horseriding, and has served as a judge in equestrianism.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"House of Brainiac\" is a Superman crossover story arc published by DC Comics in April 2024. The series is co-written by Joshua williamson with artwork by Rafael Sandoval, Rico Ossio, Edwin Galmon.\nTeased in Superman Annual 2023 #1, the story arc is told in Action Comics and Superman.\n\n\n== Plot Summary ==\n\n\n=== Publication History ===\nOn October 23, 2023 in New York Comic Con, DC Comics announced that the next Superman event will be House of Brainiac released in April 2024. It was also revealed that Green Lantern and Power Girl will have tie-ins to that event.  \n\n\n=== Prelude ===\nLex Luthor removed Superman's identity by using technology from Warworld (home planet of Mongul), Henry Bendrix's machines to amplify Manchester Black's psychic ability because he wants the world to not see Superman and Jon Kent as humans. Superman confronts Lex Luthor, and sends him back to prison.\nSuperman is then asked by Lex Luthor to be the head of Supercorp (a company that will assist Superman in his heroics). Although Superman is hesitant, he begrudgingly agrees to work with Lex.\nLex Luthor stole their research, and discarded them when he has no use of them, which leads them to be vengeful and attack Lex Luthor. Superman and Lex Luthor eventually team up to defeat Doctor Pharm and Mercy Graves. It's secretly revealed that Brainiac put Czarina (Lobo's city) in a bottle, and Doctor Pharm captured Lobo to run experiments on him.  After Superman teams up with Lex Luthor to defeat Doctor Pharm and his team, Lobo is freed and Brainiac starts heading to earth. \n\n\n=== Main Plot ===\nLois Lane is having her day off after 5 years and greets Connor Kent, Kong Kenan, Othul-Ra and Osul-Ra (children they adopted after Warworld Saga), Supergirl, Lana Lang, Natasha Irons, Steel, and Perry White on her way to a yoga session with Jimmy Olsen and Silver Banshee. Superman joins them, but hears an invasion is happening in Metropolis. As Superman and his allies started fighting off the robots and Czarnians, Steel reveals he tried calling for backup but something is interfering with their systems. Superman realizes that Brainiac is the one behind the invasion, and Brainiac sends General Chacal (a Czarnian similar to Lobo) to attack Supercorp where Lex Luthor is detained.Brainiac captures Metallo, Mercy Graves and Lena Luthor (Lex's daughter), while Lex Luthor barely escapes during the chaos. Brainiac captures all of Superman's allies including Silver Banshee and Lex Luthor, and teleports away before Superman can catch him.\nSuperman confronts Lobo at Warriors Bar in Coast City on the invasion in Metropolis but Lobo denies his involvement. Brainiac tortures Silver Banshee, when he starts coughing up blood, and asks his Brainiac clones to take him to the cooling chamber. Superman explains to Lobo what happened, and Lobo recognizes General Chacal, with Supercorp creating vehicles for Superman and Lobo to head toward Brainiac's ship due to the United Planets quarantining Earth. As they are heading toward Brainiac's ship and pass the United Planets headquarters, they are attacked by General Chacal and his minions. Brainiac heals himself and frees Lex Luthor, where Lex Luthor tells Brainiac if he leaves Lena Luthor alone, he will give him Superman. Brainiac is about to take Lana Lang to experiment her, but Supergirl realizes Brainiac's technology is from a planet called Cool, and deactivates their prison because of her experience with a Future Brainiac. However, Superboy and Supergirl realize they still dont have their powers, and have shrunk.\n\n\n=== Tie-Ins ===\n\n\n==== Green Lantern ====\nThe United Planets order Guy Gardner to bring Lobo in due to his dangerous behavior. Guy Gardener finds out Lobo has seemingly been wrestling and calls Booster Gold to confront him on letting Lobo be in a wrestling match, but Booster Gold hangs up. Guy Gardener interrupts the match, and takes Lobo into custody, but is confronted by space dolphins. \n\n\n== Reading Order ==\nThe reading order is as follows:\n\nAction Comics #1064 (Part 1)\nGreen Lantern (2023 series) #10 (Tie-in)\nSuperman (2023 series) #13 (Part 2)\nPower Girl (2023 series) #8 (Tie-in)\nSuperman: House of Brainiac Special #1 (Part 2.5)\nAction Comics #1065 (Part 3)\nGreen Lantern (2023 series) #11 (Tie-in)\nSuperman (2023 series) #14 (Part 4)\nPower Girl (2023 series) #9 (Tie-in)\nGreen Lantern (2023 series) #12 (Tie-in)\nAction Comics #1066 (Part 5)\nPower Girl (2023 series) #10 (Tie-in)\nSuperman (2023 series) #15 (Part 6)\n\n\n== Critical Reception ==\nAccording to Comicbook Roundup, Action Comics #1064 received an average rating of 8.5 out of 10 based on 9 reviews.According to Comicbook Roundup, Superman #13 received an average rating of 9 out of 10 based on 11 reviews.

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The Second Battle of Mons was a military engagement fought between 9–11 November 1918, in which Canadian forces captured the Belgian town of Mons, liberating an area that had been under German occupation since 1914.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter the failure of the German spring offensive and the Allied success at the Battle of Amiens, the Entente began an aggressive series of offensives on the Western Front which would come to be known as the Hundred Days Offensive. The Germans were forced into a full retreat eastward. The Canadian Corps closed on Mons. A city of huge symbolic value to the Entente. British troops had staged a fighting retreat in the early days of the war, delaying the Germans in their advance towards Paris but suffering heavy casualties in the process. Mons had also been under German occupation for the entirety of the war and had been used as a critical logistical centre. Now, the Canadians had a chance to recapture Mons on the last day of the war. The Imperial German Army, though badly beaten, fought a fierce rear-guard action as it retreated towards Mons. In early November, Canadian troops had taken the French city of Valenciennes after a costly battle.\n\n\n== The Battle ==\nBy November 9, Canadian forces were already on the outskirts of Mons. Arthur Currie wanted to take it to break German morale and ensure that the Germans did not think they had any pieces for negotiation. While Currie's senior officers did not protest, the men on the ground were less pleased, but trusted their commanding officer and obeyed the order nonetheless. The plan to capture Mons was an encircling maneuver, with the 2nd Canadian Division attacking from the South and Southeast, and the 3rd Canadian Division attacking from the East. On November 10, the Canadians pushed into the outskirts of the city, engaging with German patrol in skirmishes but no large-scale assaults on dug-in German positions. There was no artillery bombardment of the city due to orders from higher command not to bombard Mons with artillery in order to capture the city without destroying it. On the night of 10 November At around 11pm, platoons from the 42nd Battalion and the Royal Canadian Regiment made it through the southern defences of the city. From the west, other companies crossed into the city over bridges. By the early morning of 11 November, after heavy street fighting, Canadian forces had captured most of Mons without the use of heavy shelling. Bagpipes played and the town's inhabitants welcomed the Canadians as liberators.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe Canadians had lost 280 men killed, wounded, or missing.  Canada is traditionally assigned the tragic distinction of having suffered the last fatality among British Commonwealth forces during the First World War. Private George Price was hit in the chest by a sniper shot in the town of Ville-sur-Haine, near Mons. He died at 10:58 AM, two minutes before the armistice went into effect. In June 1927, the city of Mons erected a plaque commemorating its liberation by the Canadian Corps.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nThe news of the Armistice on 11 November 1918 was ill-received by former Canadian Minister of Militia and Defence Sam Hughes, who felt that Currie had stolen the glory of victory was rightfully his. In December 1918, Currie learned from friends in Canada that Hughes was telling anybody who would listen that Currie was \"a murderer, a coward, a drunkard and almost everything else that is bad and vile\". In a letter to his sister, Currie wrote \"Sam Hughes is a vindictive and bitterly disappointed man, and so is his son Garnet Hughes\". Arthur and Garnet were friends and Currie was most likely speaking out of anger toward Sam Hughes. Arthur and Garnet had helped each other form the 50th Regiment (Gordon Highlanders) and took the Militia Staff Course together. In fact, it was Garnet Hughes who encouraged him to reconsider and accept the position of commanding officer of the regiment after he initially declined. On 4 March 1919, in a speech before the House of Commons, Sam Hughes accused Currie of \"needlessly sacrificing the lives of Canadian soldiers\". Specifically, Sam Hughes claimed that Currie had only launched the Second Battle of Mons in order to have the Canadian Corps end the war for the British Empire where it began (the British Expeditionary Force fought its first battle at Mons in August 1914). Canadian Prime Minister Robert Borden defended Currie saying, “No criticism could be more unjust.”\n\n\n== References ==",

The highest placement they obtained was the second runner-up in 2021, won by Luisa Victoria Malz.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter Vicente Gonzalez acquired the license of Miss Grand Spain in 2015, he began franchising the provincial competitions to individual organizers, who would name the provincial representatives to compete in the national pageant the following year. In the province of Granada, the competition license was granted to a modeling agency, Eva Burgos Escuela de Modelos, which organized the first Miss Grand Granada on May 19, 2017, at the Nevada Shopping Mall in the city of Granada. The competition consisted of 18 finalists from different municipalities, of whom a student from the University of Granada, Paola Morales, was named the first Miss Grand Granada elected through the provincial contest. Previously, Granada once participated in the Miss Grand Spain pageant in 2016 with the representation of an appointed candidate, Elena Maya.\nSome municipalities, such as Ogíjares, also held community contests to elect local representatives for Miss Grand Granada.\n\n\n== Editions ==\nThe following table details Miss Grand Granada's annual editions since 2017.\n\nNotes\n\n\n== National competition ==\nThe following is a list of Granada representatives who competed at the Miss Grand Spain national pageant.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Miss Grand Spain at Wikimedia Commons\nMiss Grand Spain official website",

        "content": "The Kshiroda Plate (Pronunciation: /ʃɪˈroʊ.də/) is a hypothetical oceanic tectonic plate which is believed to have existed more than 40 million years ago, to the south of the Eurasian Plate, corresponding to the regions of modern South Asia.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nThe Kshiroda Plate was discovered when geologists studying the boundary zone between the Indian and Eurasian Plates, noticed that the data supported the existence of two parallel subduction zones between the plates.\nThis was studied in detail in 2015 by Oliver Jagoutz, a geologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and his team, who identified the possibilities of a hidden tectonic plate in the region.\nThe usage of the term \"Kshiroda Plate\" began the same year 2015.\n\n\n== Subduction ==\n\nAround 50 million years ago, the Indian Plate collided with the southern subduction zone of the Kshiroda oceanic plate causing the plate to shrink. It was pushed northwards and eventually collapsed more than 40 million years ago. It was pushed below the crust of the Eurasian Plate and this led to the formation of the Tibetan Plateau and the Himalayas.\nIt is possible that the impact might have caused the delamination of the Indian Plate beneath the Tibetan Plateau, a process which is still continuing.\n\n\n== Significance ==\nThe Kshiroda Plate has great significance in the geology of South Asia. The subduction of the plate, which occurred before 40 million years ago, caused the upliftment of the Tibetan Plateau.\nThe Tethys Sea bed which used to rest on the Kshiroda Plate was pushed above the Eurasian landmass leading to the formation of the earliest mountains of the Himalayas, while the rest of the mountains were formed due to the folding of the Indian and Eurasian continental landmasses.\n\n\n== See also ==\nIndo-Eurasian collision system\nIndian Plate\nHimalayas\nPalaeogeography\nEurasian Plate\n\n\n== References ==",

The club competes in the RFL Wheelchair Super League, the top tier of the British rugby league system. The club was formed in 2005.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn July 2005, wheelchair rugby league was introduced to England by a French team who played against a team from Halifax. The team was known as Calderdale in 2008 when several players were selected for the England world cup squad, but became Halifax RLFC Wheelchair Tag Rugby League in 2009.\nHalifax Panthers wheelchair team was one of the three founding members of the wheelchair rugby league competition in the United Kingdom along with Bury Jigsaw and Mersey Storm, with the former beating the panthers in the inaugural competition grand final. Bury would be the dominant force in the early days of the competition, winning the round robin format national championship in 2012 and 2013. 2015 saw Halifax's first silverware winning the league and cup double, which they would retain twice over winning the double again in 2016 and 2017. Halifax missed out of the league in 2018 but retained the cup for a fourth year running. Halifax won the first official Super League in 2019. Halifax's next league title came in 2022, qualifying them for the newly formed European Club Challenge in which they shared the inaugural title with French champions Catalans Dragons after a 32–32 draw.\n\n\n== Seaons ==\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\n\n=== Leagues ===\nWheelchair Super League\nWinners (5): 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2022\n\n\n=== Cups ===\nWheelchair Challenge Cup\nWinners (4): 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018\n\n\n=== International ===\nEuropean Club Challenge\nWinners (1): 2023\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHalifax Wheelchair Rugby League Club",

        "content": "Synthetic opioids, most notably fentanyl and drugs laced with it have seen increasing usage in the American city of San Francisco, California since 2019. In 2023, 810 people died from accidental drug overdoses, a majority containing Fentanyl, in San Francisco, with overdoses per 100,000 people being more than double the national average. In February 2024, 64 people died from unintentional drug overdoses.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 2014, drug possession in California was reduced to a misdemeanor, rather than a felony, with the passing of Proposition 47. In response, San Francisco law enforcement reduced their efforts against drug possession and use.\nSan Francisco has not been able to develop a comprehensive and consistent approach to drug use and overdoses; the San Francisco Department of Public Health and local nonprofits tend to argue for harm reduction strategies, while law enforcement agencies have argued for increased penalties for drug possession, use, and dealing.\n\n\n== Sources and pricing ==\nAccording to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, fentanyl is also substantially cheaper on average in San Francisco - around $100 cheaper per ounce - compared to cities like New York City and Philadelphia, and the California cities of Los Angeles and Sacramento. This cheaper pricing has been blamed for the higher overdose rate in San Francisco. As of January 2023, lower-grade fentanyl was being sold in the streets of San Francisco for $150 to $200 per ounce, while higher-grade fentanyl went for between $500 and $550 per ounce. Some fentanyl users reported that they obtained the drug for free by doing favors with fentanyl dealers.\nMembers of the DEA have said they believe fentanyl's price is cheaper in the city due to \"soft drug policies\". Local users have reported they believe the price is cheaper because San Francisco fentanyl has been diluted with other substances, pointing to the more expensive price of fentanyl in previous years. The DEA has reported that \"regular\" fentanyl sold in the city ranges on average between 5% to 10% purity. Another theory, held by some of those involved with drug policy, is that the saturation of the market in the city has driven down prices.\nAuthorities have reported that fentanyl from San Francisco is the source of fentanyl in Sacramento, and that users and dealers from across California have traveled to San Francisco to purchase the drug more cheaply, although this latter assertion has been challenged by local nonprofits.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nIn mid-2022, arrests of drug dealers and users increased again, with the appointment of a new district attorney.\nIn December 2023, the city of San Francisco began testing wastewater for fentanyl, other drugs such as amphetamine, cocaine, methamphetamine, and xylazine, and naloxone. The testing was part of a larger study by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which was also testing wastewater in 70 other U.S. cities, and is scheduled to continue until August 2024.\nBetween May 2023 and January 2024, law enforcement in the city seized 145 pounds of fentanyl. In early 2024, the California Highway Patrol recovered 42 pounds of fentanyl within a ten mile radius of the Tenderloin neighborhood in San Francisco. In the same period, the CHP issued more than 6,000 drug-related citations, leading to nearly 500 arrests.\n\n\n== Deaths per year ==\n\n\n== See Also ==\nCalifornia opioid crisis\nOpioid epidemic in the United States\nHomelessness in the San Francisco Bay Area\n\n\n== References ==",

A double album, it was released on 29 March 2024 on Flegel's own label Realistik Studios, available exclusively on YouTube and GeoCities.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nDiamond Jubilee was released to widespread critical acclaim. Andy Cush of Pitchfork gave the album a 9.1/10 review, calling it \"an essential trove of music\" where \"each song is like a foggy transmission from a rock 'n' roll netherworld with its own ghostly canon of beloved hits\". It was the highest rating awarded by the website since Fiona Apple's 2020 album Fetch the Bolt Cutters.\nElise Soutar of Paste rated the album 9.2/10, calling it Cindy Lee's \"bittersweet magnum opus\" that \"is easily the densest, most rewarding body of work they have released to date—a staggering collection of psychedelic pop songs that can be difficult to tackle head on, if only due to the sheer quantity and quality of the work\". Exclaim! gave the album a Staff Pick, with reviewer Kaelen Bell writing, \"Built on strains of '50s girl group pop, lush '60s psychedelia, itchy '70s radio rock, lo-fi '90s clutter and sparkling production choices grafted on from some alternate universe, Diamond Jubilee feels like the defining portrait of Cindy Lee as both artist and vessel.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nPatrick Flegel - performance, engineering, production\nSteven Lind - guitar (\"Baby Blue\", \"Durham City Limit\"); bass (sections of “Demon Bitch” and \"Til Polarity's End\"); drums  (\"Baby Blue\", \"Wild One\"); synthesizer (\"Baby Blue\", \"Always Dreaming\", \"Flesh and Blood\", \"Dracula\", \"Lockstepp\"); claps (\"Wild Rose\"); engineering, production, mixing\nJoshua Stevenson - mastering\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Roger Pope (20 March 1947 – 18 September 2013) was an English drummer. He was the drummer for Elton John Band in the 1970s.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHe was a session musician for DJM Records, and formed Hookfoot with other associates. The name \"Hookfoot\" came from Pope, who used to hook his foot to a hi-hat stand to keep it from sliding around during rehearsal. The group were members of the Elton John Band from 1975 to 1976. Pope replaced Nigel Olsson, who John had fired. Pope played on two of Elton's albums: Rock of the Westies and Blue Moves. When John's Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy turned 30 in 2005, a deluxe CD was released, that featured an exclusive disc that held audio of the Elton John Band performing at Wembley Stadium on 21 June 1975, a performance Pope played drums on.\nPope was also the drummer for Kiki Dee's touring band. He played drums on albums by Cliff Richard, Hall & Oates, Kevin Ayers, Seals and Crofts, Rod Stewart, Paul McCartney, and Al Stewart. Pope played drums on track seven of Harry Nilsson's 1971 album Nilsson Schmilsson. It is rumoured that Pope, along with Keith Moon and Ginger Baker, were main inspirations for the character Animal, the muppet drummer for Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nRoger Pope was born in Whitstable, Kent in 1947. His father was a drummer and his mother was a singer. He attended Itchen Grammar School. After leaving school at fifteen, he joined local band \"The Soul Agents\". Pope died of cancer in Southampton on 18 September 2013, aged 66. He was married twice.\nPope married his second wife, Sue Tressider, just hours before his death, when the couple realised that they didn't have long before Roger's demise. They had been partners for eighteen years, and tied the knot at Southampton General Hospital. The wedding was arranged after a nurse overheard Pope and Tressider talking about how they never got the chance to get married. The nurse soon got hold of registrar, and within an hour, the couple were officially married.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Additional ==\nRoger Pope discography at MusicBrainz",

        "content": "The Tillali Massacre (Danish: Massakren i Tillali), or the Battle of Tillali  (Danish: Slaget ved Tillali) was a confrontation on 30 June 1756 during the Cattle War, between the Danish command at the village of Tillali (Thillaiyadi) and the Raja of Thanjavur, Pratap Singh. The confrontation resulted in a Thanjavurian victory and a subsequent massacre of most Danish troops. After the victory, the Thanjavurian army led a further invasion into Danish Tranquebar and besieged Fort Dansborg.\n\n\n== Background and prelude ==\nIn January 1756 a newly appointed local governor called Perumal Naik was allegedly said to have raided Danish Tranquebar's surrounding districts. In June the same year, a similar incident occurred, where Naik stole a herd of cattles. As commander of the Danish border, Captain Strøbel was ordered to retaliate and marched from the Danish border town of Tillali, to occupy the Thanjavurian town of Anandamangalam with 60 men of the corps and 20-30 sepoys. The remaining force at Tillali received Danish and Indian reinforcements, to protect to border.\n\n\n=== Prelude ===\nIn reaction to the Danish mobilization of Tranquebar and fortification of Anandamangalam, the nayak of Thanjavur, Pratap Singh, sent roughly 2000 cavalry and 2000 well armed men together with Perumal Naik's army into Danish territory. The combined Thanjavurian army soon reached the Tillali, where the stationed Danes were attacked.\n\n\n== Confrontation ==\n\nIn command of the Danish outpost in Tillali, were captain Peter Hesselberg, with his Son-in-law, Hans Jacob Attrup, as ensign. In Tillali the first confrontations occurred in the local hostel and pagoda. The Danish forces retreated and took coverage behind a wall, where they got reinforcements from Tillali's local bailiff. Yet the large Thanjavurian army were no match for the small Danish contingent and the Danes were subsequently massacred.\n\n\n=== Massacre ===\nSources describing the incident differ on the death toll. Most agree that both captain, Peter Hesselberg, and ensign, Hans Attrup were killed.\nAdditionally, according to Hans Gregersen in his book Trankebar, two lower officers, 24 European and dozens of Indians were killed. All but one, who hid in the pagoda remained unharmed. A similar claim is made by Danish historian, Kay Larsen, in the brugsforeningsbladet he notes that two officers, 24 European and 45 local people from Tillali died. According to Holger Christensen's Det danske fremstoed i Indien i 1750-erne 18 men of the corps died. Another claim by Bering Liisberg's Danmarks søfart og søhandel claims that 54 people were either killed or wounded.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAfter the massacre at Tillali and the Danish retreat from Anandamangalam, all Danish districts outside Tranquebar were occupied and raided. Fort Dansborg was temporarily put in a state of emergency and besieged by the Thanjavurians.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDanish overseas colonies – 1536–1953 colonies of Denmark–Norway and Denmark\nSiege of Dansborg (1644) – Siege in Tranquebar, India 1644\nDano-Mughal War – Danish colonial conflict against the Mughal Empire\nAssault on Osu – 1678 Attack on Osu between Akwamu and Accrans forces\n\n\n== Notelist ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "revision_id": 1219552130,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Red Napoleon was a nickname for a number of communist generals. The term was popularized in the 1920s by speculation in Western media over whether one of the Soviet Union's top generals might overthrow the government in a coup.\n\nto compare several communist generals believed to share similarities with Napoleon Bonaparte, with \"red\" being used as a synonym for \"communist\". Some Western news articles speculated \n\"Red Napoleon\" was also a nickname used by the American press and early white historians for a number of Native American chiefs, with \"red\" being used as a racial description.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAt the time of the Russian Revolution, the history of the French Revolution was widely known across the Western world. Contemporaries therefore often used the events of the French Revolution as analogies to help them understand developments in the Russia. Because Napoleon Bonaparte ended the first French Republic by taking power in a coup, historian Douglas Greene argues that \"the specter of Bonaparte haunted 1917.\" Many politicians and generals (such as Alexander Kerensky and Lavr Kornilov) were accused of being \"Bonapartist\", or of attempting to follow in Napoleon's footsteps. However, no such figure successfully seized or consolidated power. After the Bolsheviks seized power in November, they feared that they would be overthrown by a Russian Bonaparte. In part to minimize this risk, they excluded \"kulaks\" from the Red Army, who they believed to be the Russian equivalent of the social class that had supported Napoleon. Socialists who opposed the Bolsheviks, in Russia and elsewhere, accused the Bolshevik regime itself of Bonapartism. \nIn Hungary, where the Hungarian Revolution was underway, the \"Red Napoleon\" moniker was applied to József Pogány, although with a different meaning than in later usage. Pogány had written a play about Napoleon, and his aggressive and abrasive personal style led his opponents to coin the nickname as an insult. The nickname was picked up by anti-Communist groups in the United States, especially after Pogány emigrated there.\n\n\n== Use of \"Red Napoleon\" in Western media ==\nWhite émigrés brought the historical analogy of the French Revolution with them when the fled to western Europe and the United States. Although most agreed that a \"Russian Thermidor\" was likely, there was little agreement over whether this would be followed by a Russian Napoleon (or whether that would be desirable). Initial speculation focused on the leader of the Red Army, Leon Trotsky. Like Napoleon, Trotsky was popular, charismatic, and a good military commander, but unlike Napoleon he refused to use his control of the Red Army to stage a coup. Instead, the troika of Stalin, Kamenev, and Zinoviev managed to oust him from his party positions and force him into exile, in part by spreading rumors that he wanted to become a Russian Bonaparte.\nAfter Stalin moved to end the NEP and collectivize agriculture, a Russian Thermidor no longer appeared likely. Many Russian émigrés thereafter lost interest in the French Revolution as a historical analogy. By the later half of the thirties, however, the hope that a Russian Bonaparte would overthrow Stalin and restore capitalism was once again widespread. Historian David Lockwood argues that in order to strengthen their military hierarchy, the USSR was forced to periodically raise the status of skilled military leaders, despite the political leadership's wariness of military independence. This led a series of military leaders to feature prominently in the Soviet press, and thence to become objects of speculation abroad over their prospects of becoming a \"Red Napoleon\". Mikhail Tukhachevsky was considered the prime candidate, but Vasily Blyukher and Semyon Budyonny were subject to similar speculation. The hopes of White émigrés were further encouraged by the Soviet secret police themselves, who spread rumors among the émigrés that leading Soviet generals were planning a coup. The rumors were spread to help the Soviet police entrap Whites who were interested in joining such plots.\nWhile the possibility of a \"Red Napoleon\" was a hopeful one to many Russian émigrés, it stoked fears of a Russian conquest of Europe among some Westerners. In 1929, Floyd Gibbons wrote The Red Napoleon, describing a possible future where Stalin dies and is replaced by an bellicose Soviet general. The general then leads the USSR on a conquest of Europe featuring \"race-mixing\" (adding fears of \"yellow peril\" to fears of communism). \n\nTukhachevsky had become famous for his military victories during the Russian Civil War, and his understanding of tactics and strategy earned him admirers in the West. He read and admired many military leaders including Napoleon, and allegedly invited the comparison by justifying his decision to side with the Bolsheviks by saying \"Wasn't Napoleon a Jacobin?\" Vasily Blyukher also gained the nickname after his victory in the Sino-Soviet conflict of 1929. \n\nWhen the Chinese Civil War sparked interest in the military endurance of the Chinese Communists, Western outlets gave Zhu De the title of \"Red Napoleon of China\". \nAfter Stalin's death, some Western media outlets speculated that Georgy Zhukov might become a Red Napoleon until he was sidelined in the post-Stalin leadership struggles.\nVõ Nguyên Giáp, a leading general for North Vietnam, was also given the nickname. However, in his case it was without the political implications, and simply reflected respect for his extraordinary military ability.\n\n\n== Native Americans called Red Napoleon ==\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, white settlers called a number of Native American leaders the \"Red Napoleon\", most prominently Chief Joseph. The term was adopted by contemporary American press accounts. Others given this nickname included Pontiac (Odawa leader) and Red Cloud. More recent historians have criticized the implication that these individuals were the sole or even the main leaders of their tribes. Historian Robert McCoy argues that rather than an accurate reflection of Chief Joseph's role, the \"focus on one 'leader' of the Nez Perce [was one of the] common threads that made the story understandable\" to a white public that wanted to imagine the Native Americans as led by a \"noble but tragic 'villain'\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Blue Revolution is a British political party based in Boston, Lincolnshire. It was founded in 2017 by former Conservative Boston borough councillor, Mike Gilbert. The party aims to give many people, from various backgrounds, the chance to run in elections, without traditional party structures. It tries to achieve this by giving anyone who endorses the party's core values of \"Contract\", \"Choice\" and \"Consent\" the ability to uses its logo, branding and party material.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was founded in 2017 to \"give blue collar workers more representation\" in a political system that founder Mike Gilbert viewed as being too elitist and tribal. Gilbert stood as a candidate for Boston and Skegness in the general election of that year. He came last with 0.7% of the vote.\nIn 2019, the party formed an alliance with the Bostonian Independent Group for the local election that May, in an effort to tackle issues such as fly-tipping and anti-social behaviour. None of Blue Revolutions candidates were elected.\nIn the 2023 Boston Borough Council election, the party gained 1 councillor.\n\n\n== Manifesto ==\nBlue Revolution describes itself as \"The home of small state socialism\" and \"not a traditional right or left-wing platform\". Instead it views itself as a brand identity, that avoids the bureaucracy of traditional parties.\nAlthough it intends for its elected candidates to be functionally independent, it does have a manifesto built around 5 broad aims:\n\nRaise awareness of the need to end party based political systems, including banning whipping.\nTo increase the power of people and reduce the power of the \"state-funded elite\".\nTo reduce elitism and unfairness through the principles of \"Contract\", \"Choice\" and \"Consent\".\nBuild an economy that is not based on debt.\nReducing demand to reverse environmental destruction and ending the use of economic growth as an objective for policy.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "SS Willehad was a passenger and cargo steamship that was built in Germany in 1894 for Norddeutscher Lloyd (NDL). For her first few years she took emigrants from Bremen to the United States. In 1900 she made one round trip between Bremen and Australia via the Suez Canal. Between 1901 and 1903 her route was between Bremen and South America. For a few months in 1904 she sailed between Stettin in Germany (now Szczecin in Poland) and New York. From the end of 1904 to the beginning of 1907 she was a mail ship between Japan and Australia. From 1911 until 1914 she ran transatlantic services between Hamburg and the United States, and also between Hamburg and Canada.\nWhen the First World War began in 1914 she sheltered in Boston. In 1916 she became the first foreign ship to use the recently-built Cape Cod Canal, as she moved to New London, Connecticut to be a submarine tender to the cargo submarines Deutschland and Bremen. The US government seized her in 1917 and gave her to the United States Shipping Board (USSB), who in 1918 renamed her Wyandotte. After the end of the First World War she made at last two round trip voyages between the US and France, and repatriated a few dozen US troops. In 1920 she tramped as a purely cargo ship. She was scrapped in the US in 1924.\n\n\n== Building and identification ==\nIn 1894 Blohm+Voss in Hamburg built a pair of twin-screw steamships for NDL. Wittekind was launched on 3 February and completed in April. Willehad was completed in May.\nWillehad's registered length was 383.4 ft (116.9 m), her beam was 46.0 ft (14.0 m), and her depth was 27.2 ft (8.3 m). Her tonnages were 4,761 GRT and 3,012 NRT. She had berths for 1,114 passengers: 105 in second class, and 1,009 in third class. Her ballast tanks carried 600 tons of fresh water, instead of sea water. This gave her enough of a fresh water supply for her third class passengers to bathe daily. In her third class dining saloon, the tables could be hoisted to the ceiling after dinner, clearing the floor for dancing. Her sick bay had five rooms, each with berths for ten patients. She had steel-hulled lifeboats.\nWillehad had a pair of three-cylinder triple-expansion engines. Their combined power was rated at 514 NHP or 1,100 ihp, and gave her a speed of 12 knots (22 km/h). She had a crew of 70. NDL registered Willehad at Bremen. Her code letters were QFVL.\n\n\n== New York and Baltimore ==\nOn 24 May 1894 Willehad left Bremen with 432 passengers on her maiden voyage. On 7 June she reached Hoboken after a voyage of 13 days and 13 hours. She remained on this route until October, and then on 10 November left Bremen on a voyage to South America. By March 1895 she was back on the Bremen – Hoboken route, on which she remained until September 1895. In October 1895 NDL transferred her to its route between Bremen and Baltimore. For the rest of the 1890s her usual route was between Bremen and Baltimore, apart from three voyages between Bremen and Hoboken in 1896, and another three in 1899–1900.\nIn January 1896 Willehad sailed to Hoboken, arriving on 1 February, but by mid-March she had reverted to the Baltimore route. She made two trips to Hoboken in early November and early December 1896. She then reverted to the Baltimore route, and on 1 January 1897 ran aground off Cape Henry when leaving Baltimore for Bremen in dense fog. The steam pilot boat from Norfolk, Virginia helped to refloat her at high tide. In April 1897 she made another trip to Hoboken, but in August and November 1897, and April 1898, her voyages were to Baltimore. By July 1898 NDL was offering weekly sailings between Bremen and Baltimore, with each ship completing a round trip on the route every six weeks.\nOn one westbound crossing, Willehad was slowed by gale-force winds from 26 December 1898 until 1 January 1899. Her passengers were kept below decks for days. A wave swept the stock of an anchor, weighing 800 to 1,000 pounds (360 to 450 kg), from her fo'c's'le to her main deck. A reel with 100 feet (30 m) of steel cable was also swept to the main deck. One of her steam winches was torn from its mountings, and its steam pipe ripped up. About 20 feet (6 m) of the railing of her fo'c's'le was swept away. One of the doors of her third class accommodation burst open, causing flooding with water 3 feet (1 m) deep. Willehad reached Baltimore on 10 January, six days late.\nOn 19 March 1899 Willehad left Bremen with 850 passengers. On 24 March, at position 48°N 25°W, her starboard propeller shaft broke, and she lost her starboard propeller. She turned back, and on 28 March reached Falmouth, Cornwall. After repairs she resumed her voyage, and on 11 April she reached Hoboken. She then continued to Galveston, where she arrived shortly after 3 May. She loaded a cargo of cotton, and left for Bremen on 15 May. She then returned to her route between Bremen and Baltimore.\nIn 1898 an electrician in Willehad's crew, Adolph Pahlmann, had courted a Viennese passenger, Marie Brenner, and the couple had become engaged. Brenner went to stay with her uncle in Kansas, but the next year, on 13 August 1899, the couple were married in Baltimore. They held their wedding reception at a German-owned restaurant there, and spent their wedding night in a room over the restaurant. The couple planned to move to Pahlmann's home city of Hanover, Germany, with the bride sailing as a passenger aboard Willehad. Early the next morning Pahlmann went to rejoin his ship, and his bride went back to bed for a few hours. A few hours later, the restauranteur found her dead from coal gas poisoning. She had turned off a gaslight, but the valve was not fully closed, and she was poisoned in her sleep. Her funeral was held on 16 August, and the next day Pahlmann left Baltimore aboard Willehad. A few hours after sailing, Pahlmann and another crewman were on deck when a great wave hit the ship and threw them against a bulkhead. Pahlmann was knocked unconscious, and his shipmate's leg was broken in two places. The ship's doctor treated the two men, but 20 minutes later Pahlmann was dead. At 17:00 hrs on 18 August, Willehad stopped in mid-ocean and lowered her colors. Pahlmann's funeral was held, and he was buried at sea.\nWillehad remained on NDL's Baltimore route until November 1899, and then in December 1899 and January 1900 made two voyages between Bremen and Hoboken.\n\n\n== Australia via Suez ==\nIn 1900 Willehad's passenger accommodation was refitted. Instead of a two-class ship with more than 1,000 third class and no first class, she became a three-class ship with berths for only 230 passengers: 150 in first class, 40 in second class, and 40 in third class. She made one round trip on the Reichspostdampfer route between Bremen and Sydney, New South Wales via the Suez Canal, as a temporary substitute for the liner Gera. She left Bremerhaven on 18 July 1900, and called at Antwerp, Southampton, Genoa, Naples, Port Said, Suez, and Colombo.\nHer reception in Australia was mixed. On 30 August she reached Western Australia, where she was greeted as \"the smallest vessel of the Norddeutscher Lloyd that has visited Fremantle\". One Perth newspaper said \"From outward appearances the vessel does not give a favorable impression not being up to the standard of the Norddeutscher Lloyd liners in cleanliness or beauty\". On 5 September she anchored in Largs Bay, South Australia with 236 passengers, of whom 40 were for Adelaide. On 8 September she reached Melbourne, Victoria, where she was described as \"a shapely vessel\" that was \"bound to establish herself in the public favour\". On 12 September she berthed in Woolloomooloo Bay in Sydney.\n\nOn 22 September she left Sydney on her return voyage to Bremen. She called at the same ports as on her outward voyage. As she left Adelaide on 29 September, she saluted the Australia Station flagship HMS Royal Arthur by lowering her German ensign, and by her band playing God Save the King. She reached Bremen on 15 November.\n\n\n== Changes of route ==\nNDL transferred Willehad to its route between Bremen and South America. She made 12 voyages on this route, the last of which began from Bremen on 23 May 1903.\nIn March 1904 NDL and Hamburg America Line (HAPAG) announced a joint service between Scandinavian ports and New York. Two ships would serve the route: NDL's Willehad and HAPAG's Adria. The service was to be called \"Scandia Line\" – not to be confused with the Danish Scandinavian America Line. HAPAG and NDL aimed to undercut Cunard Line, which also served this route. Fares were $18 from Scandinavia to New York, and $16 from New York to Scandinavia. Willehad worked the route from Stettin, from which she made her first Scandia Line sailing on 3 May 1904. She called at Helsingborg and Gothenburg in Sweden, and Kristiansand in Norway. She arrived in New York on 19 May, carrying 218 steerage class passengers. She made three round trips on this route. Her final Scandia Line voyage began from Stettin in August, and she was scheduled to leave New York for the return voyage on 17 September.\n\n\n== Far East ==\nDuring the Russo-Japanese War, the Russian Empire expelled several hundred Japanese from Vladivostok, Port Arthur (now Dalian in China), and Outer Manchuria. Two railway trains had taken the refugees to Bremen, and from there NDL took them to Japan. Sources differ as to whether Willehad took them all the way from Bremen to Japan, or the NDL liner Großer Kurfürst took them to Fremantle, where on 21 November 1904 they were transferred to Willehad. They also disagree as to whether the number of refugees was 707 or 832.\n\nEither way, Willehad took the Japanese via Singapore, where on 26 November, as she was leaving her wharf, she collided with the Burns, Philp steamship Airlie. Two plates on the starboard bow of Airlie's hull were damaged, and a guard-rail at Airlie's stern was damaged. She reached Nagasaki on 6 December, and continued via Moji and Kobe to Yokohama, where she arrived on 12 December. At each port the Japanese entertained Willehad's officers, and at Yokohama Emperor Meiji received them, and gave Willehad's Master, Captain Zurbonsen, an award.\nNDL planned a new mail service between Yokohama and Sydney via Kobe, Hong Kong, German New Guinea, New Britain, and Brisbane. Willehad started on the route from Yokohama on 31 December 1904, and reached Sydney on 1 February 1905. Her running mates on the route were Prinz Waldemar and Prinz Sigismund. By April 1906, Willehad's ports of call also included Manila in the Philippines. On 15 December 1906 she left Melbourne,. for a voyage via Sydney, Newcastle, Manila, and Java. She then returned to Bremen, where she arrived on 20 March 1907.\n\n\n== From Hamburg to Boston ==\nBy June 1910 Willehad was equipped with submarine signalling,  and by June 1911 she was also equipped with wireless telegraphy. In November 1911 she made a voyage from Rotterdam to Baltimore. By May 1912 she was serving a route between Hamburg and Montreal via Rotterdam. In January 1913 she arrived in Philadelphia.\nBy 1914 Willehad's wireless call sign was DWH. On 10 July 1914 she left Hamburg on her twenty-fourth voyage to Quebec and Montreal. By the end of July 1914 she was in Montreal, loading a cargo that included wheat, barley, flour, and oil cake. In response to the July Crisis, 200 Austro-Hungarian reservists in Canada booked to sail on her to return home. However, on the eve of war the German government ordered her to leave Montreal and seek refuge in neutral Boston, to avoid being seized in Canada. She left Montreal early on the morning of 1 August. War was declared on 3 August, but Willehad evaded the cruiser HMS Essex, and reached Boston on 5 August. Willehad stayed at anchor near Boston's quarantine station until 27 August, when she moved to Charlestown, Boston to discharge her cargo into bonded storage, including 57,671 bushels of wheat and 29,950 bushels of barley to the Boston and Maine Railroad's grain elevator.\n\nThe DDG Hansa cargo ship Ockenfels also reached Boston on 5 August. In the next few days and weeks they were joined by the HAPAG liners Amerika and Cincinnati; the Austro-Hungarian steamship Erny; and three other NDL ships: the cargo liner Köln; Willehad's sister ship Wittekind; and later the liner Kronprinzessin Cecilie. In order to save on port dues, the ships moved to anchorages after discharging their cargo. They moved back into Boston Harbor for the winter of 1914–15, and then returned to their anchorages near Boston's quarantine station at the end of March 1915. The US Navy positioned the cruiser USS Brooklyn to keep all of the anchored ships under constant surveillance.\nIn 1915, events such as the Thrasher incident at the end of March and the Sinking of RMS Lusitania early in May increased tension between the US and Germany. At the end of May, US armed forces were ordered to fire upon any German or Austro-Hungarian ship that tried to leave a US port, and to sink her if she did not heave to.\n\n\n== From Boston to New London ==\nIn August 1916 the Eastern Forwarding Company (EFC), agents for the cargo submarines Deutschland and Bremen, chartered Willehad. On 23 August she left dry dock, bunkered several hundred tons of coal, ice and stores, and returned to her pier. An application was made for two ships to use the Cape Cod Canal. Permission was granted for Willehad, but the other ship, whose name was not disclosed, was larger, and permission for her was denied. She embarked a full crew, and early on 24 August was piloted out of Boston. A tugboat met her off Plymouth, Massachusetts and accompanied her to the mouth of the Cape Cod Canal. The canal had opened on 29 July 1914, and Willehad became the first foreign ship to use it.\nA tug of the T.A. Scott Towing Company, Alert, put out of New London to try to meet Willehad and convoy her into port, but ran into thick fog. Alert carried Captain Hinsch, EFC's Marine Superintendent, who was previously Master of the NDL liner Neckar. At 16:00 hrs on 24 August Willehad passed Hen and Chickens Light in Buzzard's Bay, but ran into afog an hour later, and anchored for the night. The next morning she got underway at 05:00 hrs, and docked in New London just before 10:00 hrs.\nWillehad was moored to piling in the Thames River, with her stern against the river bank. About 50 feet (15 m) to one side of her was the State Pier, which had recently been built at a cost of $1 million. The EFC had hurriedly built a corrugated iron shed, 400 by 25 feet (122 by 8 m), on the pier. Between the pier and  Willehad's bow, EFC built a floating gate 30 feet (9 m) high. This enclosed a space between the ship and the pier large enough for a cargo submarine to dock, and then be secluded when the floating gate was closed. The piling under the pier, and the piling to which the ship was moored, was electrically wired to an alarm bell in an office attached to the shed.\nOn 28 August 1916 the submarine Bremen left Bremerhaven on her maiden voyage. She was headed for a port on the East Coast of the United States, but never arrived. On 29 September a life jacket, stained with oil, was found at Maiden Cove on Cape Elizabeth, Maine. Stencilled on it was the word \"Bremen\", and printed on it were a small crown, with \"Schutzmarke\" above, and \"V-Epping-Hoven, Willhelmshaven\" below. The life jacket was smaller than those normally carried on steamships, and was said to be similar to those carried on submarines. Bremen never did reach port, and no other wreckage of her was ever found.\nWillehad remained at New London, and her wireless was sealed in accordance with US neutrality regulations. On 25 October the British government claimed to have intercepted two letters from members of her crew to relatives in Germany, claiming that Willehad was to put to sea to operate as a wireless station for U-boats from within US territorial waters.\n\n\n== Tender to Deutschland ==\n\nThe submarine Deutschland left Bremen on 10 October, and reached New London early on the morning of 1 November. She docked between Willehad and the pier, and Deutschland's 25 crew moved into the best cabins aboard Willehad. Cargo worth $10 million was discharged from Deutschland to the shed: including synthetic dyes, pharmaceuticals, gems, and financial stocks and bonds. On Sunday 5 November Willehad hosted a Lutheran service for the submariners, led by a minister from Hartford, Connecticut.\nOn 8 November, 2,000 New London townspeople attended a reception at the Municipal Building for Deutschland's Master, Paul König, and his officers. After the reception, the New London Chamber of Commerce hosted a dinner for König; and for Captain Jachens of Willehad; seven members of their respective crews; and 300 guests. König was presented with a gold watch, engraved with the seal of New London.\nEFC employed 60 African American stevedores to load Deutschland. They loaded a cargo estimated to be worth more than $2 million, comprising 360 tons of nickel; 180 tons of crude rubber; and bars of zinc and silver. The nickel was imported from Canada via a company in New Jersey; stored in the warehouse of another company in New York; and transported via a railroad yard in Baltimore.\n\nAt 22:00 hrs on 16 November the lights on the EFC pier were switched off, and a launch from Willehad went down the harbor. Deutschland left her dock at 01:30 hrs on 17 November, and two tugs towed her down the harbor. A launch full of news reporters followed them. The flotilla passed the cruiser USS Columbia at 01:45 hrs. Columbia and several passenger ships pointed searchlights at Deutschland, and blew their whistles. However, one of the tugs, T. A. Scott, Jr., turned across the submarine's bow. Deutschland unintentionally rammed the tug; sinking her; and killing all five of the tug's crew. The only survivor was EFC's Captain Hinsch, who was a passenger. Deutschland's bow was damaged, so she returned to port for repairs.\nThe T.A. Scott Towing Company libelled the submarine for $12,000 for the loss of the tug, so Deutschland's crew had to leave the submarine. They were quartered aboard Willehad while the legal dispute was resolved. The families of the five tugboatmen killed also filed lawsuits. On 20 September enough of a legal agreement was reached between the parties for Deutschland to leave port, and her crew returned from Willehad to their submarine. On 21 November Deutschland left New London for Bremen; accompanied by Captain Hinsch aboard the T.A. Scott tug Alert, but this time in daylight.\nDeutschland safely reached her home port in the Weser by 11 December. In January 1917 Willehad remained prepared for either Deutschland or another cargo submarine to visit New London. There was speculation about \"a submersible, said to be larger than Deutschland\", but no such craft existed. Nor did Deutschland return, as U-boat attacks on merchant ships caused relations between the US and Germany to deteriorate. In February 1917 the Imperial German Navy took Deutschland over and had her converted for combat as U-155.\nOn 3 February 1917 the US broke off diplomatic relations with Germany. On the same day, fire broke out on the State Pier in New London, where cargo was stored for Deutschland's expected return. On 6 February more cargo arrived at the State Pier, mostly copper and crude rubber. Also on 6 February, Bridgeport's Collector of Customs, James McGovern, announced that Willehad's crew would be removed and treated as immigrants. However, no such action was taken.\n\n\n== Seizure ==\nOn 2 April 1917 the submarine USS D-1 came from New York to New London, and anchored near Willehaid to guard her and the State Pier. On 3 April, guards \"from a United States warship\" were deployed on the pier. Willehad's charter expired, and the EFC did not renew it, so control of her reverted to NDL.\nOn 6 April the US declared war on Germany, and ordered the seizure of all German ships in US-controlled ports. At 03:30 hrs on 6 April a force from the United States Coast Guard Academy in New London boarded Willehad. A captain, four lieutenants, 30 enlisted men, and 14 Coast Guard cadets took over the ship, and Collector McGovern requisitioned her. They caught Willehad's crew asleep, which prevented any of them from trying to scuttle her. Bureau of Immigration officers brought 36 members of Willehad's crew were brought ashore, leaving aboard one man who was too ill with rheumatism to travel. He was later taken off to hospital. The 36 were given breakfast in New London, and later the Immigration officers took them by Shore Line Express train to New York, on their way to Ellis Island. They were interned with the crews of other seized German ships in a camp at Mountain Park, North Carolina.\nAt first it was reported that Willehad's machinery was found undamaged. Later it was reported that they had sabotaged her, but \"the damage inflicted on the machinery by the now interned crew is not as bad as at first imagined\".\n\nA Californian, Harry S Bates, claimed that in October 1915 NDL had contracted to sell him Wittekind and Willehad for $900,000, but had refused to fulfil the contract. On 3 May 1917 he filed a suit at the United States District Court in Boston for possession of both ships. On 30 June President Woodrow Wilson issued an executive order authorising the USSB to take possession and title of 87 German ships, including Willehad.\nOn 8 May Willehad left New London, and on 25 May Collector McGovern auctioned perishable merchandise that had been removed from her before she left. Early in June it was reported that work to recondition and fit out Willehad and other seized ships \"will go along steadily\", and that she would be ready for US war service in July. However, on the evening of 29 August fire was discovered aboard her, when she was moored at \"Army Pier 6\" in Hoboken, which was part of the former HAPAG liner terminal. Eight Hoboken Fire Department companies turned out to fight the fire, and extinguished it within an hour. An investigation found the fire had started in oneof her cargo holds, where plumbers had been working, and one of them had carelessly used a blowtorch near a box of flammable supplies.\n\n\n== Wyandotte ==\nIn 1918 the USSB renamed the ship Wyandotte. She was registered in New York, her US official number was 215297, and her code letters were LHMD. On 24 November that year she left Brest, France, and on 14 December she arrived in New York. On 23 February 1919 she left Bordeaux carrying men of the American Expeditionary Forces. One officer and 33 men were of Detachment C of Casual Company 33. Another officer and three men were a medical detachment. She arrived in New York on 12 March. On 7 August 1919 she arrived in Boston from New York. On 14 August she left Boston for London, England.\nOn 9 April 1920 Wyandotte was reported to have arrived in Vlissingen, the Netherlands, from New York. On 17 April she left Antwerp in ballast for the Black Diamond Steamship Company, and on 3 May she reached New York. Still under charter to Black Diamond, she left New York on 7 May and reached Philadelphia on 10 May. On 18 May she left Philadelphia, and on 3 June she reached Rotterdam. On 12 June she left Rotterdam for Wilmington, Delaware. On 21 August she left Savannah, Georgia. On 3 November she left Charleston, South Carolina.\nWyandotte was scrapped in Baltimore, starting on 31 March 1924.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBonsor, NRP (1975).

        "content": "The Gupta - Kidarite Conflict  was a military confrontation of the Imperial Guptas Under the Command of Skandagupta during the Reign of Kumaragupta and the Kidarites.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Kidarites consolidated their power in Northern Afghanistan before conquering Peshawar and parts of northwest India including Gandhara probably sometime between 390 and 410, around the end of the rule of Gupta Emperor Chandragupta II or beginning of the rule of Kumaragupta I. It is probably the rise of the Hephthalites and the defeats against the Sasanians which pushed the Kidarites into northern India , this proved to be a threat to the Guptas.\n\n\n== The Conflict ==\n...whose [Skandagupta's] fame, moreover, even [his] enemies, in the countries of the mlechchhas... having their pride broken down to the very root, announce with the words \"verily the victory has been achieved by him.\" \nIt is more likely that the enemies who threatened the sovereignty of the Guptas were not only the Pushyamitras, but also the Kidarites. In the Junagadh inscription, it refers the Kidarites (or the Hephthalites;  who are referred to under the name of the Mlecchas. Skandagupta's victories over the mlecchas were described as the conquest 'of the whole world'. It is hard to figure what this claim refers in terms of geographical fact, but it appears that Skandagupta's armies repulsed the Kidarite invasion somewhere on the River Sutlej (or perhaps further east). Thus, even after Skandagupta's victories, central and western Punjab probably remained in the hands of the invaders,  although he had managed to stop their advance eastwards.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nR.

        "content": "Árpád Ajtony (January 9, 1944 – January 16, 2013) was a Hungarian writer, dramaturg, screenwriter, social psychologist, and university lecturer in exile. He started his career as an avant-garde writer and became a significant figure in the Hungarian emigration in France before the political transition.\n\n\n== Career ==\nA descendant of the Transylvanian Armenian Ajtony family (original name: Ajváz/Ajváh), he was born in Székelykeresztúr, at the time in  Hungary, now Cristuru Secuiesc, Romania. He moved to Budapest at a young age. His father, Dezső Ajtony, was a chief physician. He completed his university studies at the Faculty of Arts of the József Attila University (now University of Szeged), then transferred to the Faculty of Arts, Hungarian-history department of the Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, where he graduated as a teacher in 1967. He then worked as a dramaturg at the Budapest Film Studio, participating in the work of the Béla Balázs Studio. His first publications appeared in 1968 in the spirit of the artistic avant-garde. His writings were also published in Hungarian journals in Yugoslavia. He contributed to the first samizdat, the Szétfolyóirat. After the cultural policy led by György Aczél did not tolerate his work, he emigrated to Paris in 1973. In France, he continued his studies at the University of Vincennes, attended social psychology courses, and obtained degrees in psychology in 1978 and in social psychology in 1981. He defended his doctoral thesis in 1981 on the national identity and self-image of Austria. He worked in psychiatric institutions and taught sociology and anthropology courses for healthcare workers. In the 1990s, he was invited to lecture at the University of Versailles, where he taught at the psychology department. In the 1970s and 1980s, he was a leading figure in the Hungarian emigrant cultural life in Paris. He lived in New York for half a year in 1983.\nAfter the political changes in Hungary, he became involved again in the Hungarian film industry, primarily as a screenwriter and experimental film actor. He also organized French-Hungarian cultural events and research projects, mainly related to the psychological processes of ideological development and reassessment. During this period, his previously banned works began to be published, and for his book The Loss of the Empire, written in the 1970s, he received the Sándor Bródy Prize for first-time authors in 1999. His only son, Dániel, was born in 1999. He died in Paris, a week after his 70th birthday, on January 16, 2013.\n\n\n== Major works ==\nWhere the Island Begins (anthology, 1969)\nDifferent Every Day (anthology, 1971)\nGrey Magic (1972)\nThe Loss of the Empire (1998)\nWhy So Late? 1969–1972; Orpheus, Budapest, 2002Scientific publications\n\nConversion, Identity and Social Change (2000)\nDoubling and Differentiation of the Representation System.

        "content": "Lilian Avis Scantlebury OBE born Lilian Avis Whybrow (12 January 1894 – 12 April 1964) was an Australian Red Cross worker. She was one of the designers of what became the Australian Red Cross Society. She was involved in writing letters from the Red Cross to the families of Australian soldiers. She lived at and served the development of Janet Clarke Hall in Melbourne.\n\n\n== Life ==\nScantlebury was born in 1894 in Collingwood. Her parents were Alice Williamina Hook (born Rostron) and Arthur Whybrow. Her father made boots. She graduated from the University of Melbourne after residing in what was then Trinity College Hostel and is now called Janet Clarke Hall.\nDuring the first world war she went to London. In May 1916, the Australian Wounded and Missing Enquiry Bureau moved its headquarters from Cairo to London, after the Australian Imperial Force's attention was transferred to Europe. Vera Deakin White had started the Bureau in Cairo in 1915. and it had initially gathered information about the fates of soldiers in the Gallipoli campaign for the families of Australian soldiers. Scantlebury joined the bureau in London in 1916 and in time she led the letter section. In the following year there was 60 people working for the bureau and it moved to a larger headquarters. In three years of operation the organisation created 32,000 files for individual soldiers, and issued 400,000 responses. Deakin was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1918 New Year Honours. Deakin was succeeded as head of the bureau by Scantlebury in 1919.\nSupported by her husband she worked to prepare the British Red Cross Australian Branch to deal with emergencies whether of natural or man-made cause. Building on her experience in the first world war the Red Cross again began letter writing. She became the director of the Victoria branch of the society. In 1948 she and Vera White were made commanders in the Order of St John. In the 1959 New Year Honours she was made an OBE.\nScantlebury died in 1964 in South Melbourne. She had served Janet Clarke Hall from 1926 and in 1961 she joined the board after arguing for its existence in the first place as a separate organisation. After her death, a wing of Janet Clarke Hall, was named for her.\n\n\n== Private life ==\nShe married a physician (later surgeon) George Clifford Scantlebury in 1920 and they had a daughter.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiography at ADB",

        "content": "Adam Mieczysław Gawin (born December 27, 1939, in Cracow, died June 26, 2012) was a Polish professor of geophysics from 1983 to 2000 at the AGH University of Krakow. His specialities included geophysics, exploration geophysics, drilling geophysics, mining and engineering geology, sedimentary rocks, theoretical physics, astrophysics and relativistic cosmology.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHe was born on December 27, 1939, in Cracow, Poland. He graduated from the King Stefan Batory Primary School in Cracow, and then the 3rd Secondary School of the Society of Friends of Children in Cracow. In the years 1957-1962 he studied geology at the Faculty of Geology and Exploration of the AGH University of Science and Technology. He graduated with distinction.\n\n\n== Work in academia ==\nIn 1962, he began working as an assistant at the Department of Seismic Exploration Methods and Drilling Geophysics, Department of Geological Geophysics, Faculty of Geology and Exploration. In 1965, based on the thesis \"Electromagnetic profiling in a wellbore in the case of environmental heterogeneity\", written under the supervision of Professor Henryk Orkisz, he obtained a Ph.D. In 1971, based on his dissertation \"Drilling electromagnetic profiling in an anisotropic rock medium\", he obtained a habilitated doctor's degree. In the years 1972-1982 he was an assistant professor at the Interministerial Institute of Applied Geophysics and Petroleum Geology, Faculty of Geology and Exploration. In the years 1973-1981 he was the head of the Doctoral Study in Geophysics. In the years 1983-2000 he was a professor at AGH.\nIn the years 1962-2000 he cooperated with scientific institutes, universities, technical universities, geological and exploration enterprises in Poland and with the Scientific Research Committee of the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Technology. He was a member of the Geological Sciences Committee of the Polish Academy of Sciences, the Geophysics Committee of the Polish Academy of Sciences, the Well Geophysics Section, and the Association of Engineers and Technicians of the Petroleum Industry.\nHe received the 3rd degree individual award of the Minister of Science, Higher Education and Technology, the 2nd degree team award of the Minister of Science, Higher Education and Technology, a Diploma and an Honorary Medal \"for active participation in the work of the symposium in the field of mathematical methods and computer science in PTG geodesy\", he also received the Rector of AGH University of Science and Technology Award many times.\n\n\n== Personal life and cultural significance ==\nHe was married to Helena Gawin née Dereń since 1964. He had two children, including Elżbieta Gawin, a controversial online personality known for streaming on YouTube. Gawin has become somewhat of an internet phenomena due to his daughter, who regularly mentions her father during her livestreams, often idolising him or accusing him of various abuses, making him a topic of discussion in non-academia circles. A nickname “córa belwederska” (Belvedere daughter) was coined because of how Elżbieta Gawin highlights her father's professor's degree; in Poland, the title of professor is awarded to people with a habilitated doctor's degree for outstanding scientific or artistic achievements. Since this title is awarded by the President of the Republic of Poland, and the ceremony related to the awarding of this title sometimes takes place in the Belvedere Palace, the person to whom this title has been granted is also called a “Belvedere professor” in less official circumstances.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Johnson Creek Premium Outlets, formerly Johnson Creek Outlet Center, is an open-air outlet mall in Johnson Creek, Wisconsin. The mall sits next to Interstate 94, and is approximately 45 miles (72 km) west of Milwaukee and 35 miles (56 km) east of Madison, the two largest cities in Wisconsin. The mall was developed by JMJ Properties, and was built in stages between 1998 and 2001. Since 2004, it has been owned by Simon Property Group and managed as part of Simon's Premium Outlets division.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe mall was originally developed by JMJ Properties of Muskegon, Michigan. The southern portion of the mall, featuring 39 stores and totaling 170,172 square feet (15,809.5 m2), held its grand opening on May 22, 1998, although about half of the stores participated in a soft opening the weekend before that. The second phase of the mall added another 17 stores, and its grand opening was held on June 18, 1999. The third and final phase brought the mall to a total of 62 stores and restaurants in 278,000 square feet (25,800 m2) of space.\nJMJ Properties sold the Johnson Creek Outlet Center to Chelsea Property Group, the owner of 53 other outlet malls nationwide, in November 2002. Chelsea Property Group was acquired by Simon Property Group in June 2004, and the Johnson Creek Outlet Center became part of Simon's Premium Outlets division. With the sale, the mall was rebranded as Johnson Creek Premium Outlets.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

To engage with the bot, one needs to go to the Post Mortem Post page and click the \"Send Message\" button. This will start a dialog with the chatbot. Next, the bot will ask one to choose a Legacy Contact - a person who will have the right to manage the user's Facebook profile after their death. The assistant also offers an option to specify the charity that the user wishes to support in their farewell message. As a result, the chatbot will generate a posthumous post that can be forwarded to the Legacy Contact so that he or she can post it on behalf of the user when they die.\nThe company has developed the LOFT framework.\nUkrainian experts built a chatbot for the Catholic Church in New York, in which 7,000 masses have already been ordered.\nThe streaming cooking platform Kittch was created by Ukrainian developers.

Employees who join the military continue to receive their compensation. Throughout 2022, the company also arranged a series of workshops with a psychologist to address fear, anxiety, and panic as normal responses to abnormal situations.\nUA Anti Spam Bot - Dmytro Vakulenko, a Software Engineer at Master of Code Global, developed an algorithm that uses keywords to identify events and locations shared on social networks, then deletes the message and warns the user about sharing such information. The UA Anti Spam Bot has significantly streamlined the work of chat administrators by automatically deleting unwanted messages. The chatbot now removes harmful comments and offers anti-fraud and air alert functionalities in Telegram groups and channels. The development team further expanded the bot's capabilities in November 2022 by adding a function to automatically delete scammers' messages containing links to alleged energy services. It functionality proved so valuable that it was installed by the administrators of more than 900 Ukrainian Telegram channels reaching more than 1 million users.\nTo reduce the consumption of Russian content, \"18000\" and MOCG created a step-by-step guide that helps users adjust algorithms on Google Chrome, social networks, music, and video platforms to recommend more Ukrainian sources.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nThe top 10 Marketing Ops Individuals recognized by the awards include Amanda Stevens from Master of Code.\nEmployer Branding Star 2023.\nInfobip Innovation Partner 2023.\n#2 Mobile App Development Companies in Seattle.\nCanada's 35 Top CEOs in the iOS Space.\n#9 among the most promising AI Companies.\nMost reviewed Inbound Marketing Company in Ukraine (2022).\nPart of TOP-25 employers list in the IT sector, open to young talents under 25 years old.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAmazon Alexa\nCortana (software)\nGoogle Assistant\nApple Siri\nViv (software)\n\n\n== References ==",

It was produced by Eddie Berg, Harald Barret and Henrik Udd.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nDistorted Sound scored the album 9 out of 10 and said: \"Imminence aren't just a band, they're an experience, a feeling, a state of mind. The Black cements their place within the metalcore hierarchy. Expect even bigger things to come.\" Ghost Cult gave the album a score 9/10 and saying: \"With such theatrical innovation that challenges and transcends Metalcore, Imminence have become pioneers of a style that can best be described as Violincore. While each preceding album was a step in the right direction, The Black pulls off just the sound they were always meant to create.\" Louder Sound gave the album a positive review and stated: \"The Swedes' four studio albums so far have seen them tinker with overly polished production and the kind of atmospheric metalcore Architects left behind six years ago (2021's solid, albeit repetitive Heaven in Hiding bore more than a passing resemblance to Sam Carter and co), but with The Black, they've taken a step forward.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nImminence\n\nEddie Berg – lead vocals, violin, production\nHarald Barret – lead guitar, backing vocals, production\nAlex Arnoldsson – rhythm guitar\nChristian Höijer – bass\nPeter Hanström – drums\nAdditional personnel\n\nHenrik Udd – production\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ramveer Tanwar is an Indian social activist and water conservationist  known for his work in water conservation, pond beautification, the revival of water bodies, and the developing of urban forests across India. He has contributed to cleaning and restoring approximately 80 ponds across states such as Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Gujarat, and Karnataka. He is often referred to as the Pond Man of India.\nTanwar is the founder of the social organization 'Say Earth' and the 'Jal Chaupal' campaign, focused on the revival of water bodies and promoting environmental awareness. He serves as the brand ambassador for the Swachh Bharat Mission, appointed by Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation and holds the position of Ghaziabad district coordinator for the Ground Water Force under the Government of Uttar Pradesh.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nRamveer Tanwar was born in Dadha village in the Gautam Buddha Nagar district of Uttar Pradesh. He is the youngest of five siblings. He received his primary education in his village. In 2014, Tanwar graduated from KCC Institute of Technology and Management with a bachelor's degree in Mechanical engineering.\nAfter graduating, Tanwar worked as an engineer briefly before committing to full-time environmental and water conservation work. He received groundwater conservation training from the Central Pollution Control Board of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.\n\n\n== Work ==\nIn 2015, Tanwar launched the 'Jal Chaupal' campaign to conserve water and revive water bodies, starting in Dadha village. He expanded the initiative to raise awareness on water conservation in rural areas of Uttar Pradesh, including Dabra, Kulipura, Chauganpur, Sirsa, Rampur, and Salempur. Initially focused on awareness, Tanwar later engaged in removing illegal encroachments, beautifying, and reviving ponds.\nBy 2021, Ramveer had revived about 40 ponds, including Gautam Buddha Nagar, Ghaziabad, Saharanpur, Palwal, Manesar, and Delhi. By 2023, Ramveer Tanwar has completed the cleaning and renovation of about 80 ponds in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, and Gujarat.\nIn 2018, he launched the 'Selfie with Pond' initiative to actively involve the youth. Under this campaign, young individuals began capturing selfies with ponds and sharing them on social media. To specify the locations, participants were encouraged to include the pond's name. The initiative garnered widespread attention, as the images of cleaned water bodies served as inspiration, and motivated local officials to clean them. The campaign also received support from individuals of Indian origin residing abroad, as well as citizens from the United States, Canada, and Indonesia.\nIn 2020, Ramveer Tanwar founded the non-profit, Say Earth, which is engaged in its ongoing pond cleaning efforts. Major contributors include NGOs like HCL Foundation, Green Yatra, and Sleep Well Foundation.\nTanwar is currently creating several urban forests using Japan's Miyawaki method. In this process, he converts barren land allotted by the government into fertile land and then plants trees to conserve urban land, protect soil quality, and reduce air and land pollution.\n\n\n=== Mann Ki Baat ===\nIn the October 24, 2021 broadcast of the radio program Mann Ki Baat on All India Radio, Prime Minister Narendra Modi commended Ramveer Tanwar for his outstanding work in cleaning and conserving ponds.\nIn the 100th episode of the Mann Ki Baat program in April 2023, Ramveer Tanwar was selected as one of the 100 guests nationwide. During the five-day program, he participated in the National Conclave at Vigyan Bhawan, New Delhi, on April 26, 2023. Activities included a visit to the Rajpath at Rashtrapati Bhavan and the Pradhanmantri Sangrahalaya on April 27, followed by a yoga session, a tour of the Red Fort, and Rajghat on April 28, 2023. On April 30, 2023, Ramveer attended a Mann Ki Baat session with Governor Anandiben Patel at Raj Bhavan in Lucknow.\n\n\n=== Jal Choupal ===\nJal Chaupal is an initiative launched by Ramveer in 2015 to raise awareness about water scarcity and related factors. It serves as a platform for discussions on topics like groundwater, drainage, water pollution, rainwater harvesting, and water budgeting.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nHis life story was featured in Volume 4 of the Ministry of Culture's comic book Mann Ki Baat, published by Amar Chitra Katha in July 2023. In 2022, on World Environment Day, National Geographic, as part of its 'One for Change' initiative, showcased a series of short films featuring social activists, including Ramveer Tanwar, who has worked to make the world a better place. The series was also broadcast on Disney+ Hotstar.\n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\nRamveer was awarded the Shining World Protection Award from Taiwan, which also provided a grant of US$10,000.\nIn 2019, he was awarded the Rex Karmaveer Chakra Award, a global civilian honor by the United Nations and iCONGO.\nIn September 2022, Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation appointed Ramveer Tanwar as the brand ambassador for the Government of India's campaign, Swachh Bharat Mission.\nIn May 2022, Tanwar received the Wetland Champions 2022 award from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), presented by Union Minister Bhupender Yadav and Minister of State Ashwini Kumar Choubey.\nIn July 2022, he was honored with the State Ground Water Award by the Uttar Pradesh Government for his contribution to water conservation.\nHe was awarded the Water Hero Award by the Ministry of Jal Shakti.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRajendra Singh\nUma Shankar Pandey\nLaxman Singh (conservationist)\nAnand Malligavad\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nMeet India’s superhero saving ponds from stagnation at Euronews\nInterviews\nएबीपी के टीवी शो 'क्या बात है' पर रामवीर तंवर at ABP News\nReviving ponds needs planning, team effort: India's Pond man at New Indian Express",

        "content": "Orto was a monthly anarchist cultural magazine which was published in Valencia, Spain, between 1932 and 1934. Its subtitle was Revista de documentación social (Spanish: Magazine of social documentation).\n\n\n== History and profile ==\nOrto was started in Valencia in 1932, and its first issue appeared in March that year. It was founded and edited by Marín Civera. Josep Renau worked as the graphic editor of the magazine. Major contributors of Orto included Benjamín Jarnés, Ramón J. Sender, Isaac Puente, Hildegart Rodríguez and Vital Aza.\nOrto was published on a monthly basis by the Institute of Social History Foundation and supported the Spanish labour movement. The magazine aimed to provide a forum for people with the different working-class ideologies depending on the ideas of syndicalism. Like other publications of the period in the country it also supported the premises of Neo-Malthusian and Eugenics. In terms of economics the magazine adhered to Marxism for which it was criticized. Marín Civera attempted to develop a synthesis of Marxism and anarcho-syndicalism in the magazine.\nOrto featured articles on health, science, urbanism, agrarianism, politics, economy, sexuality, art, feminism and social struggles. It also published critical articles on religion. \nOrto folded in January 1934 after producing twenty issues.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The first Benazir Bhutto government was formed on 2 December, 1988 following general elections held in 1988. Due to the PPP only securing a plurality, the new government forged a coalition alliance with the MQM, ANP, JUI(FR) and other additional independents.: 398  Following elections President Ghulam Ishaq Khan called upon Benazir Bhutto, later announcing the formation of a new government.: 211  Benazir promised while taking oath on 2 December to eradicate illiteracy, poverty, restore student unions, liberate political prisoners, provide equal rights to women and free the media. However, the Army's continued influence and lack of a legislative majority led to her later declaring her government's freedom of action was \"institutionally, economically, politically (and) structurally\" constrained.: 298  Later during Presidential elections the same year, Benazir Bhutto solidified her alliance with President Ishaq Khan through supporting his bid for re-election.: 398  However later the two came into conflict, over the division of powers between the two offices and as the President continued to support Bhutto's opponent Nawaz Sharif.: 401–402  Eventually on 6 August, 1990 Ghulam Ishaq Khan issued an order under Article 58(2)(b) dissolving the National Assembly causing the Prime Minister and the cabinet to cease holding office. The stated charges of dismissal for the Bhutto government were corruption and the deteriorating law and order situation in Sindh.: 402–403 \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formative Period ===\nFollowing the 1988 elections, the PPP did not gain a majority but emerged as the largest single party with 93 seats, 11 seats short to form a majority. The second largest party in the National assembly being the IJI and its 55 seats. Independents had secured 23 seats, MQM 13 seats, and JUI (Fazlur-Rehman Group) 7 seats. Nawaz Sharif the following day announced that the IJI would form a government, according to Hamid Khan, Sharif intended to make up for his lack of a electoral plurality through the support of the President Ghulam Ishaq Khan.: 397  Following MQM and ANP alliance with the PPP, the President instead decided to call upon Benazir to meet with him, and shortly later it was announced that the first civilian-led government in eleven years was to be formed.: 211  According to Lawrence Ziring, Ishaq Khan pursued this path in order to establish stability \"as quickly as possible\" and because he was disinclined to see the army under Aslam Beg take control of the government following Zia's death.: 210  Hamid Khan claims that Ghulam Ishaq Khan sought a full five-year term as President, so after \"delivering a majority in the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab to the IJI\" to counterbalance Bhutto he sought a deal with the PPP for his election. In the later Presidential elections that year, the PPP ignored its old ally Nawabzada Nasrullah for Ishaq Khan, who won with 603 votes out of 752.: 398 \n\n\n=== Formation Provincial Governments ===\n\n\n==== Punjab ====\nThe Islami Jamhoori Ittehad in Punjab would be able to secure 34.98% of the vote.: 296  Despite the PPP (52 seats) securing more seats than the IJI (45 seats) in the National Assembly, in the Provincial Assembly the IJI secured got 108 seats compared to the PPP's 94. With the help of most of the independents the IJI would be able to form a government with Nawaz Sharif as Chief Minister.: 399  Punjab would provide the main power base of the IJI, comprising of both Nawaz Sharif and Junejo Muslim leagues and eight other allied parties held together by opposition to the PPP. According to Muhammad Waseem, the incumbent caretaker Chief Ministers used public funds to finance its candidates during the election. According to Ian Talbot, the requirement that voters produce identity cards also strengthened the IJI.: 295  \n\n\n==== Sindh ====\nIn Sindh the PPP had won 67 out of a 100 general seats in the Provincial Assembly, securing a majority. Out of 31 independents in the Assembly, 26 belonged to the MQM but ran on independent tickets. On 20 March, the period until with which Governors could appoint Chief Ministers had lapsed, hence Qaim Ali Shah of the PPP was elected by the Provincial Assembly as Chief Minister of Sindh.: 398 \n\n\n==== North West Frontier Province (NWFP) ====\nIn the NWFP no single political party had won an absolute majority. Out of 80 general seats the IJI had won the highest (28 seats), followed by the PPP (22 seats), ANP (13 seats) and as many as 15 independents. In order to form a government, Benazir approached Wali Khan head of the ANP to form a coalition, with the offer being accepted. Several independents also joined the PPP-ANP in NWFP. Aftab Sherpao would form the government as Chief Minister. Later when the PPP-ANP coalition broke down he would remain as CM.: 398–399 \n\n\n==== Balochistan ====\nIn Balochistan, out of 40 general seats, 11 went to JUI(FR), 10 to the Balochistan National Alliance (BNA), 8 to the IJI, 4 to the PPP and the remaining seven to minor political parties and independents. The Provincial Assembly met on 2 December to elect the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the assembly and later to elect the Chief Minister of the province. Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali received 21 votes for and 21 votes against his bid for Chief Ministership. The Speaker issued a certificate declaring him elected by 22 votes including the casting vote of the speaker.: 399 \n\n\n== Cabinet ==\n\n\n=== Federal Ministers ===\n\n\n=== Ministers of State ===\n\n\n== References ==",

On the other hand, if the squatters are Bahamian nationals, the state will attempt to house them, helping them financially. As of 2004, the government had no means of assessing exactly how much squatting was occurring across the island country.\nIn 2022, the National Security Minister Wayne Munroe said that the state wanted to help squatters who were Bahamian nationals, but not if they were squatting on Crown land.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Cuprostibite  (the name is formed from the addition of two words: cuprum and stibium) — a very rare polymetallic mineral of the sulfide class, consisting of mixed copper and thallium stibnite (although not in all samples), sometimes with admixtures of tin and other metals, ideal formula Cu2(Sb,Tl) or Cu2Sb. The mineral is opaque, it has a metallic luster and a beautiful color from steel gray to violet-pink when freshly chipped.\nCuprostibite was discovered in South Greenland (1964) and described in 1969 by a group of scientists, which included Evgeny Semyonov, Henning Sorensen, Marianna Bezsmertnaya and Evgenia Khalezova.\n\n\n== Discovery history and name ==\nA new, previously unknown mineral was found in 1964 by E. I. Semyonov and H. Sorensen during a joint expedition to South Greenland,: 29  and chemical and optical analysis and identification of the mineral were carried out by them together with Marianna Bezsmertnaya on the basis of the Moscow Institute of Mineralogy, Geochemistry and Crystal Chemistry of Rare Elements. More detailed data about the mineral were obtained later by S. B. Maslenkov using an X-ray microprobe at the Institute of Ferrous Metals.: 26–27 \nIn 1969, Evgeny Semyonov described the history of the discovery of the mineral in a separate book dedicated to the expedition to South Greenland and the mineralogy of this area:\n\nCuprostibite <...> discovered by E. I. Semenov and H. Sorensen and studied by them together with M. S. Bezsmertnaya. The mineral is found in the large ussingite pegmatite of Mount Nakalak <Nakkaalaaq> in association with minute Loellingite segregations. Cuprostibite forms opaque grains 1-2 mm in size, black, and on fresh chips steel-gray in color with a distinct violet-red tint. The lustre is strong, metallic. <...> The mineral is soft.: 26 \nCuprostibite was originally defined as a natural copper stibnite with the formula Cu5Sb2 and was considered as such for almost five years. It received its name, consisting of two roots, in 1969 — according to the composition that was considered relevant at that time. Thallium, periodically detected in the composition of cuprostibite, was initially attributed to the number of impurities introduced from surrounding rocks and minerals, in particular chalcotallite. Meanwhile, the formula of the mineral was refined in the late 1990s to the modern form Cu2(Sb,Tl), when it was determined that if present in the mineral (up to 3 wt%) thallium is included in its chemical composition. Also, sulfur was found in some samples from the type deposit of Mount Nakkaalaaq (Greenland), so the proportional formula for Greenland cuprostibite increased to four components: Cu2.00(Sb0.82S0.08Tl0.04)Σ=0.94\nHowever, the name of the mineral remains the same. Cuprostibite samples obtained from the Greenlandic Kangerdluarsuk plateau and from the Swedish Langbaan do not contain thallium and sulfur impurities. Their ideal formula is also different from the original one and looks like Cu2Sb.\n\n\n== Properties ==\nAccording to the first detailed description of the discoverer of the mineral Evgeny Semyonov, cuprostibite forms opaque granular aggregates and small black phenocrysts no larger than 1-2 mm in size. On fresh chips, the color is steel-gray with a distinct violet-red tint, but the fracture quickly oxidizes and loses its bright color. The shine is strong, metallic. The fracture is uneven. Sometimes cleavage is found, corresponding to a vaguely expressed tabularity. Lamellar twins are observed. The mineral is soft. Hardness — 220 kg/mm2.: 26–27 \nAccording to the studies of Marianna Bezsmertnaya, carried out in 1969 with samples of the mineral from a typical deposit in Greenland, in reflected light cuprostibite under a microscope has a distinct violet-pinkish tint, its reflectivity is high, the effects of anisotropy with crossed nicols are strong colored, noticeable in air double reflection; light sections are creamy-whitish, dark sections are pinkish-violet. There is a strong dispersion of the main indicators of reflection and double reflection.: 29 \nOne of the striking features inherent in cuprostibite is its ability to form the finest polymineral mixtures, the size of metal particles in which varies from several tens of microns to 100-200 Å. The stability of such mixtures over a long geological time (at least 200-250 million years) can only be ensured by their isolated position inside dense host rocks.: 48 \n\n\n== Mineral formation ==\n\nCuprostibite was discovered by Evgeny Semyonov and co-authors in alkaline rocks of the Illímaussaq massif, South Greenland.: 192  This deposit was studied in more detail by S. Karup-Muller and co-authors. Cuprostibite, similar in composition to Cu2Sb, was encountered by him within the Ilimuassak massif at several points: in ussingite veins that cross-cut nauaite and are closely associated with lujavrite veins and aeginized nauaite, in analcime-aegirine veins located in the contact zone between nauaite and lujavrite, in sodalite-analcime rocks.: 48 \nSubsequently, the mineral was also found in Europe and North America, where it is found most often in veins of syenite-sodalites or mineralized dolomites. Type deposit — original discovery site, Mount Nakkaalaaq, Greenland.: 236 \nFor the first time in the USSR, cuprostibite was discovered in the early 1980s by Margarita Novgorodova in the Kumak-Kotansu shear zone in the Southern Urals.: 52 \nLater, cuprostibite was established and diagnosed in the Zolotaya Gora deposit (Chelyabinsk region, Karabash urban district, Soymonovskaya valley); in the Kumak gold-bearing region (Orenburg region, Yasnensky district) and in Tajikistan at the Bolshoi Kanimansur silver-lead-zinc deposit (Sughd region, Adrasman-Kanimansur ore field).\n\n\n== See also ==\nBezsmertnovite\nSemenovite\nAvicennite\nMontbrayite\nNagyágite\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCuprostibite (A valid IMA mineral species):information about the mineral cuprostibite in the Mindat database.\nCuprostibite: John W.

        "content": "The Embassy of Sweden, Brussels was the diplomatic mission of Sweden in Brussels between 1837 and 2011. The mission was elevated from legation to embassy in 1956. The embassy in Brussels had a bilateral role, focusing on enhancing Sweden's relations with Belgium. It housed a consular section offering services to Swedish citizens and individuals with Swedish connections. Additionally, the embassy hosted the Swedish Trade Council's office as its trade section. The ambassador's responsibilities included maintaining continuous dialogue with the Belgian government, especially regarding EU affairs, and fostering economic and cultural ties between Belgium and Sweden. Since 2011, a Stockholm-based ambassador has been responsible for the bilateral relations between Sweden and Belgium. In 2020, Sweden opened a consulate general in Brussels with a focus on consular activities.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe diplomatic mission in Brussels was established in 1837. From 1869 to 1895, the mission was shared with The Hague, Netherlands, located in the latter city and covering both states. Until 1921, the envoy in Brussels had a dual accreditation in The Hague.\nDuring World War II, the envoy post was vacant between 1942 and 1944. From 1 April 1944, Gunnar Hägglöf served as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the Belgian government in exile and the Dutch government-in-exile in London. In November of the same year, the Swedish mission in Brussels resumed its operations after Hägglöf returned there from London. The Swedish properties in Belgium were relatively unscathed during the war. The mission and consulate general in Brussels, the consulate general in Antwerp, as well as the Seamen's Church and other Swedish institutions, were undamaged.\nIn March 1956, an agreement was reached between the Swedish government and the Belgian government to mutually elevate each other's legations to embassies. In connection with this, the Swedish government appointed the then envoy Gunnar Reuterskiöld as ambassador.\nDuring the 2010s, the Swedish embassy in Brussels received the \"Entreprise écodynamique\" accolade, which was an official recognition and reward for environmental awareness for both public and private companies in the Brussels region. As the only embassy in Brussels, the Swedish embassy was awarded a first star and could then be called - Entreprise écodynamique.\nOn 22 December 2010, the Reinfeldt cabinet decided to close the embassy in Brussels, along with four other Swedish embassies. According to Foreign Minister Carl Bildt, the decision was a consequence of the Riksdag deciding to cut the grant to the Government Office by SEK 300 million. The embassy closed on 1 July 2011. Since 2011, a Stockholm-based ambassador has been responsible for the bilateral relations between Sweden and Belgium. On 2 November 2020, Sweden opened a consulate general in Brussels. The consulate general's focus is consular activities, including ensuring readiness to assist individuals in crisis or disaster situations.\n\n\n== Tasks and staff ==\nThe embassy in Brussels was bilateral and had the task of promoting Sweden's relations with Belgium. The embassy included a consular section that provided services to Swedish citizens as well as to third-country citizens with connections to Sweden. The Swedish Trade Council's office in Brussels was attached to the embassy as a trade section. The ambassador's task was to conduct ongoing dialogue with the Belgian government, particularly on EU matters, and to promote the economic and cultural relations between Belgium and Sweden.\nIn 2010, the embassy had the following positions: ambassador, ambassador's secretary, counselor and deputy head of mission, trade secretary, a position for economic affairs, EU project exports and trade promotion, a press counselor, a cultural and information officer, a consular officer, a receptionist, a third embassy secretary, an administrative officer, as well as locally employed staff in the form of an administrative assistant, chauffeur, and chauffeur/caretaker.\nAfter the closure of the embassy in the summer of 2011, a consulate was established with the following tasks: issuing temporary passports, delivering regular passports, national identity cards, and driver's licenses issued by authorities in Sweden or a Swedish embassy, name registration and co-ordination numbers (samordningsnummer), life certificates for Swedish citizens, death certificates for Swedish citizens who have passed away in Belgium, certain other certificates, citizenship application, and delivery of residence permit cards.\n\n\n== Buildings ==\n\n\n=== Chancery ===\nIn July 1911, the chancery moved to Rue Van Eyck 25 in the municipality of Ixelles south-east of Brussels' city centre. Here it remained until 1915. With the German occupation of Brussels in 1916, the mission moved to Hotel des Indes in The Hague, Netherlands, which was neutral during the war. Here it stayed until 1918 before returning to Rue Van Eyck 25 in Brussels in 1919. In 1920, the office moved to Avenue Louise 162 in the southern part of the City of Brussels. It remained there until 1928.\nIn 1928, the house at Avenue Géo Bernier 13 in Ixelles was acquired by the Swedish state (see section on the residence below). The house served as the chancery and residence until 1960. From 1961 to 1962, the chancery was located at Rue de l'Aurore 2, a few hundred meters away from the residence at Avenue Géo Bernier 13. In 1963, the chancery moved to Avenue Louise 148, where it remained for over 35 years, until 1999. From 2000 until the closure in 2011, the address was Sweden House, Rue du Luxembourg 3, a few hundred meters from the Royal Palace of Brussels.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Residence ===\nIn 1928, on the initiative of then envoy Gustaf von Dardel, the Swedish state purchased the house at Avenue Géo Bernier 13 in Ixelles. The house was designed in 1913 by the architect Adrien Blomme as a residence and architectural office for himself and his family. Blomme's family couldn't move in until 1916 due to the First World War.\nBlomme, inspired by Italian Renaissance and Andrea Palladio's architecture, designed the house with four floors and a basement. It includes ceramic relief panels on the back, which are replicas of Andrea della Robbia's decorations on Brunelleschi's Ospedale degli Innocenti in Florence. The ground floor façade is made of sandstone while the other floors have yellow plaster with window frames of natural stone. The courtyard façades are of whitewashed brick, and the roofs are covered with slate tiles. At the time of acquisition, renovations were carried out, including the conversion of the architectural firm's office into a banquet hall and the construction of a fireplace with the Swedish national coat of arms. Additionally, a connection was established between the main building and the upper part of the house over the courtyard. The purchase of the property was related to the marriage of the Swedish Princess Astrid to the Belgian Crown Prince Leopold. The residence was intended to better reflect \"Sweden's elevated status through marriage\", and the princess's parents, Prince Carl and Princess Ingeborg, would be able to be housed in a dignified manner. Since then, the property has served as the Swedish ambassador's residence in Brussels.\nIn 1997, the city of Brussels decided to protect certain parts of the property as cultural heritage. This included the roofs, façades, entrance, hall, staircase, and landing, along with three rooms on the first floor facing the street, as well as the lower gallery at the back. The house is managed by the National Property Board of Sweden, and the tenant is the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.\n\n\tAvenue Géo Bernier 13\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Heads of Mission ==\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

He is also the only non-Jamaican member of the Constitutional Reform Committee, which is advising the Jamaican government on how to revise their constitution. He also serves as co-president of the International Society of Public Law.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\n\nAlbert was born in Quebec to a Trinidadian father and a Haitian mother. He received his B.A. and J.D. degrees from Yale University, his B.C.L. from the University of Oxford, and his LL.M. from Harvard University. He clerked for Beverley McLachlin, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nIn 2023, local Christians in the area advocated for the removal of Albert from the Constitutional Reform Committee saying \"he has a distinct pro-LGBT and pro-abortion bias\".\n\n\n== Publications ==\nConstitutional Amendments: Making, Breaking, and Changing Constitutions.

Aditya Sachdeva, an 18-year-old college student, was allegedly shot dead by Rocky Yadav during a road rage incident.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAditya Sachdeva was driving with his friends when his car overtook a sport utility vehicle (SUV) driven by Rocky Yadav, the son of a local politician. This led to an altercation between the two parties, during which Rocky Yadav allegedly shot Aditya Sachdeva, resulting in his death.\n\n\n== Investigation and legal proceedings ==\nRocky Yadav was arrested shortly after the incident and charged with murder, among other offenses. The case gained significant media attention and public outcry due to the involvement of Rocky Yadav, whose mother, Manorama Devi, was the serving MLC from Janata Dal (United) party.\nThe case proceeded through the legal system, with hearings and trials taking place over the subsequent years. In September 2017, the Gaya District Court convicted Rocky Yadav of murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment.\n\n\n== Acquittal by Patna High Court ==\nHowever, on 20 July 2023, the Patna High Court acquitted Rocky Yadav and two other accused individuals due to lack of evidence. This decision was met with controversy and public debate, raising questions about the effectiveness of the investigation and the administration of justice.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jean Baptiste Brevelle II (French: Jean Baptiste Brevel II) was a French and Native American explorer, translator and soldier of the militia at Fort St. Jean Baptiste des Natchitoches in present-day Natchitoches, Louisiana and Le Poste des Cadodaquious in Texas.\n\n\n== Early Life ==\nBrevelle was born in 1730 at a Caddo village on the frontier lands of French Louisiana near Fort St. Jean Baptiste des Natchitoches.  His father, Jean Baptiste Brevelle, was a Parisian-born trader and soldier stationed at the fort.  His mother, Anne des Cadeaux, was a Native American slave.  Brevelle spent the first several years living in Native American villages following his father's military and trade assignments with various Caddo tribes in Louisiana, Arkansas and Texas.\nIn 1736, the family returned to Natchitoches where he was baptized in the Catholic Church in what would later become the Roman Catholic Diocese of Natchitoches. His father obtained permission from Fort Commandant Louis Juchereau de St. Denis to marry his mother and free her from slavery. After the publication of three  banns, his parents were married in Natchitoches. \n\n\n== Explorer of French Louisiana and New Spain ==\nFort St. Jean Baptiste des Natchitoches was a fortified post on Red River of the South to establish France's claims to the region and to prevent the Spanish forces in the province of Texas from advancing across the border. Being half Indian and with his knowledge of Caddo customs and languages, Brevelle enlisted in the militia serving as a soldier and translator for the French colonial government.  His assignments took him on the El Camino Real (English: The King’s Highway) in Louisiana and Texas. Brevelle mapped areas along the Red, Sabine, and Trinity Rivers as he lived among and traded with the Natchitoches, Adai, Hasinai, Nasoni, Yatasi, Tawakoni and Kadohadacho Indians.\nIn 1762, France ceded the colony to Spain as part of the Treaty of Fontainebleau. The treaty followed the last battle in the French and Indian War. Brevelle then served the colonial government of New Spain as a translator and soldier.\nIn 1767, Brevelle led a band of his Caddo kinsmen across Louisiana, Texas and New Mexico. He left the supply base at Le Poste des Cadodaquious and traveled to Sante Fe and was one of the first explorers of the Continental Divide of the Americas.  His knowledge of Native American languages and customs helped to negotiate and establish trade agreements with the various Native American tribes. Upon returning to Natchitoches, his travels had brought him wealth and a sizable land grant, which today bears his name: Isle Brevelle.  The 30-mile long isle is 2-4 miles in width and located south of Natchitoches along the Red River and Cane River.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nin 1760, Brevelle married Marie Francoise Poissot, the daughter of a wealthy French officer; a remarkable feat for a half-breed and son of a slave. Together, they had 13 children (4 sons and 9 daughters). He built a plantation on Isle Brevelle where he grew tobacco and raised livestock. The plantation was also an exporter of lumber, leather and bear grease to the growing port of New Orleans.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nBrevelle died in 1806 on his plantation at Isle Brevelle near Bayou Brevelle but he and his family left a lasting legacy in Louisiana. \nBrevelle was one of the first Creoles. John Sibley, Indian Agent and council to Louisiana's first U.S. Governor, in 1804 reported to the U.S. Congress that Isle Brevelle was named for its earliest settler, Jean Baptiste Brevelle II. Bayou Brevelle and Brevelle Rail Station are also named after him.\nFort St. Jean Baptiste des Natchitoches became the town of Natchitoches, the oldest permanent settlement in the Louisiana Purchase territory.\nThe former Brevelle Plantation (now Isle Brevelle) is home to the Cane River Creole National Historical Park and is the birthplace of Creole culture. In Louisiana, the term Creole is defined as native-born people of ethnic European background mixed with Native American and/or African. Brevelle's story and that of his sister are documented in the records of the Catholic Church and in their interviews with Indian Agent Dr. Sibley after the Louisiana Purchase which are on file in the American State Papers, Library of Congress, and the Annals of Congress.\nSt. Augustine Parish (Isle Brevelle) Church, Bayou Brevelle, and Isle Brevelle in Natchitoches Parish and Brevelle Lake in Red River County are named for this pioneer family.\n\"The Caddo left their names, art, and culture in Louisiana. Several colonial European families can claim Caddoan ancestors: Grappes, Brevelles, Balthazars, and others.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nCane River (film)\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "In 1937 the Kurds were deported from Azerbaijan SSR and Armenian SSR. In 1944 the Kurds of Georgian SSR were also sent to the \"special colonies\", including those in Siberia, and were resettled there. Most adult males were deported separately from females and children with their fate unknown.\nIsmet Cheriff Vanly emphasizes that \"the deportations of 1937 were quite unrelated to the Second World War or its anticipation. Nor can the deportation of 1944 be connected with the war. In this respect they differ from the cases of the Crimean Tatars and the Volga Germans\". He refers to Professor Shakero Mihoyi, according to whom the deportations transpired at the instigation of Mir Jafar Baghirov, the Azerbaijani government's leader, who maintained close connections with Stalin and the OGPU. Vanly continues that \"[w]hile this may be true in the case of the Kurds deported from Azerbaijan, it fails to explain why Armenia and Georgia followed suit\". He writes that it appears that the deportations were instigated by pressure from Turkey, as Turkey was concurrently engaged in the deportation of its Kurdish populace.Not all Transcaucasian Kurds were subjected to deportation for resettlement in Kazakhstan, Kirghizia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Siberia. Some among them were able to eventually return to Transcaucasia. However, the precise figures regarding the deported population remain unknown.According to Vanly's calculations, \"in 1990 […] the four districts of Kurdistan might have a total population of 300±350,000 of whom some two-thirds would be Kurdish, and in Transcaucasia as a whole Kurds would have numbered close to one million, including 500,000 in Azerbaijan, had it not been for deportations and other forms of persecution\".The census data from 1970, which recorded 88,930 Kurds in Soviet Union, reflects, together with the manipulation of the figures, the fact of mass deportation of Kurds. Vanly criticizes the explanation of Soviet philologist Magomet Isayev that the reason for the sharp decline in the number of Kurds in the census was their \"assimilation\", because they were \"scattered among several other nationalities\", as a \"typical Soviet euphemism for the forcible deportations of 1937 and 1944 and the resettlement in Soviet republics largely in Central Asia\".Among the deported Kuds were Nadir Nadirov (from the Azerbaijan SSR) and Arab Shamilov (from the Armenian SSR).Vanly places responsibility for the enforced deportations of the Kurds on Stalin and Baghirov and their adherents.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nUnder Mikhail Gorbachev, Kurds from different republics of the USSR held rallies. On May 20, 1989, a sizable and well-organized demonstration conducted by Kurds occurred in Moscow's Pushkin Square. Representing groups from nine Soviet republics, the demonstrators subsequently marched to Ismailovsky Park the following day, as documented by Soviet media outlets, including television. Particularly notable among the demonstrators were women from the Central Asian republics, where the majority of adult Kurds are female due to the forced deportations and disappearances of their male relatives over the preceding fifty years. Their spokeswoman, Mezihe Ghefûr, made the statement about legacy of Kurdish deportations and the problems of the Kurds in the USSR.On August 17, 1989, the Supreme Soviet enacted a law stipulating the repatriation of all Soviet citizens who had been subjected to deportation during Stalin's regime, with the restoration of their previous rights. Nevertheless, its implementation faced significant challenges. While certain groups, like the Volga Germans, were able to return to a welcoming homeland, for others such as the Crimean Tatars and the Kurds, their original territories had been colonized by Russians, and in the case of Kurds, by Azerbaijanis, posing serious barriers to their return.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nVanly, Ismet Cheriff (1992).

        "content": "Akylina of Drama (1921–2006) was a Greek Asia Minor Orthodox nun who lived in the Monastery of the Ascension of the Savior in Drama, serving as Abbess. She was significantly active during the National Resistance.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nErasmia, the daughter of Georgios and Eftychias Parmaxidou, was born in Theira, Smyrna, on 23 April 1921. During the Asia Minor Catastrophe, seven of her relatives were martyred on the gallows, while she and her family left Asia Minor. Refugees came to Piraeus on 14 September 2009 and a little later they settled in the city of Drama.\nThe young Erasmia moved with her family to Thessaloniki due to the harsh Bulgarian Occupation in Drama. She offered significant help to people by arranging assistance for the hungry in the Lagada region as well as participating in the National Resistance, risking her life by feeding the detained resistance Greeks in the Pavlos Mela camp in Thessaloniki which had been turned into a place of detention and torture by the Germans.\nIn the 1950s, she organized common meals in Drama to address the wounds of the Bulgarian Occupation and started the camps of the Metropolis of Drama in Granite.\nShe formed an association with women for the purpose of consecrating them to monasticism. The association headed by Akylina, in April 1970 with the supervision and support of the Metropolitan of Drama Dionysios, settled in the then abandoned area of the Taxiarches of Drama (Sipsa) where there was a nadir of the Ascension of the Savior.  On 17 July 1970, and at the age of 50, she assumed the great and angelic shape and was named Akylina nun. Abbess Anna Makkavaiou of Asia Minor, who greatly appreciated Abbess Akylina, joined the brotherhood.\nAbbess Akylina, alongside her main spiritual duties, worked for the construction of the Monastery. The entire edifice of the Monastery is the work of her activity together with the first association and the younger nuns. On 25 April 1971, the inauguration of the Holy Monastery took place.\nAbbess Akylina died on 16 November 2006.\nSaint Paisios characterized her as \"Old Woman of Old Womens\" and Saint Porphyrios of Kausokalyvite called her \"Cherub with golden wings\".\n\n\n== References ==",

His stage performances often involve lip-synching to archival audio recordings.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nAt the age of five, Beau played the Handsome Prince in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and knew he wanted to act. His childhood idols included Judy Garland and Marilyn Monroe.Beau trained in drama at Manchester University, and subsequently worked in a Milan theatre company, Teatro della Contraddizione, whose work was inspired by Pina Bausch.\n\n\n== Technique ==\nBeau's use of lip-synching was inspired by the drag queen Suppositori Spelling, who he met in London in 2006. An additional inspiration for his technique was the journalist Richard Meryman. Beau sometimes lip-synchs to his own voice, sometimes to those of other performers. He calls the technique \"rememberment\", and it has also been described as \"hauntological dramaturgy\".\n\n\n== Stage work ==\n\n\n== Film performances ==\n\n\n== Awards ==\n2012 London Cabaret Award for Best Alternative Performer\n2013 Jardin d’Europe Contemporary Dance\n2014 Oxford Samuel Beckett Theatre Trust Award\n2017 Best Supporting Male in the Off-West End Theatre Awards\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBeau is openly gay, having known his sexual orientation from the age of around five or six.

        "content": "Breck Road (formerly Breck Street; colloquially known as The Breck) is a road in Poulton-le-Fylde, Lancashire, England. Originally known as Breck Street, it runs for about 0.79 miles (1.27 km) from Chapel Street, Ball Street and Vicarage Road in the south to Amounderness Way (the A585) in the north. \nThe road is one-way northbound between its Chapel Street/Ball Street/Vicarage Road junction and Victoria Road, just beyond Poulton-le-Fylde railway station.\nIt is part of the A588, a designation it picks up from Chapel Street. Amounderness Way eastbound inherits the A588 designation. \nSources differ as to whether Breck Street was the former name of Breck Road or Station Road. An October 1926 edition of The London Gazette lists all three streets. \n\n\n== Notable landmarks ==\n31 Breck Road (formerly the home of George Henry Bernasconi)\nPoulton-le-Fylde railway station (built in 1896)\nWyre Civic Centre (formerly Cotton Industry Convalescent Home and the Mary MacArthur Home)\nThe Ship Inn once stood at today's 2 Breck Road, a space now occupied by The Cube restaurant. The Ship was popular with Fleetwood seamen, travelling labourers and locals.\nThe Royal Oak Hotel stood at the corner of Breck Road and Station Road between 1842 and 2018, when it was demolished. Across Breck Road stood the Railway & Station Hotel, built in 1838.\nBreck House, across from today's Breck Lodge, was the home of James Sykes, a wine merchant from Liverpool. It is now a housing estate, while the public swimming pool stands on part of its former gardens.\nIn 1876, a chapel and presbytery, along with \"elegant Gothic schools\" connected thereto, were mentioned. This is St John's Chapel, at the corner of Moorland Road,  which was built in 1813 and is Grade II listed.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1940, during World War II, Breck Road was chosen by the Royal Air Force as one of two sites for personnel with minor infectious diseases to regain health. It was named \"Emergency Hospital\"; the other site was the Convalescent Home at Lytham Hall.\n\n\n== Public transportation ==\nBreck Road is served by Blackpool Transport's routes 5C, 74 and 75 and Transpora's route 523.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "João Santana Rebello (né Rebêlo; 9 February 1928 – 2 December 2011), known mononymously as Mastor, was an Indian musician, double bass player, and former trumpeter known for his work in khell tiatr and zomnivoile khell (street play) productions.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJoão Santana Rebêlo was born on 9 February 1928 in Benaulim, Goa, which was part of Portuguese India during the Portuguese Empire (now in India), to palm tree farmer Joaquim Peidade Rebelo and homemaker Pascoela Gomes, into a Goan Catholic family. He was the third of three children, with an elder brother João Caetano (born 1917) and a sister Jacinta (born 1924).\n\n\n== Career ==\nRebello was a musician known for his contributions to the cultural scene. Originally a trumpet player in zomnivoile khells (street plays), he eventually shifted his focus due to health concerns and became actively involved in organizing khell competitions. Rebello played a pioneering role in bringing zomnivello khell to the stage, organizing the first-ever ticketed khell competitions. One of his significant accomplishments was the organization of the inaugural khell tiatr in Benaulim, Goa, featuring a competition between the works of mestri Anton Marie and Konkani playwright A. Moraes. In the late 1960s to the early 1980s, Rebello embraced the double bass and showcased his musical prowess as a member of the popular dance band, Luis and his Melodians, for 12 years. He collaborated with his brother Joao Caetano, who was also a musician proficient in the double bass, trumpet, and tuba. Rebello's brother Joao Caetano also led a brass band that performed at a variety of events, including feasts and funerals. During these performances, he would play either the snare drum or the big bass drum. Rebello's musical legacy influenced the next generation, particularly his two sons, Jack and Agnelo, who embarked on their own musical careers at a young age of 14 by joining their uncle Joao Caetano's band. Additionally, Rebello actively supported drama shows by providing essential amenities such as pandal facilities and organized parking spaces for the convenience of the attendees.\n\nRebello played a crucial role in nurturing his son Luis's musical career, imparting drumming skills to him during his formative years. Concurrently, Rebello himself was an adept drummer. Additionally, Rebello was recognized as a proponent and patron of khells, a traditional Goan theatrical performance. Fostering an innovative idea, Rebello conceived the notion of hosting a zomnivoile khell competition on a stage akin to those employed in tiatrs, a popular form of Goan theater. To realize this vision, Rebello reached out to two khell maestros, Anton Moraes (A. Moraes) from Benaulim and Anton Marie from Orlim, who eagerly embraced the opportunity to showcase their zomnivoile khells on a stage, a novel prospect for them. Assuming the primary role in organization, Rebello meticulously coordinated the event. On an Easter evening of 1 April 1956, when several khells were already captivating audiences across Goan villages, Rebello collaborated with Manuel João Costa, a pandal decorator (mattoukar) from Varca, to erect a stage at Tolleabandh, Benaulim. The structure featured a mattou (pandal) housing a stage at one end, complemented by chairs arranged in front to accommodate the audience, akin to a tiatr setting. Unlike tiatrs, there were no elaborate curtains or intricate stage settings. Rather, the zomnivoile khell performed on this stage retained its original essence, with the actors directed to face the audience and deliver their performances upon request.\nOn that particular occasion, two distinct khells, which were popular forms of theatrical performances, were showcased. The first khell, titled Zolmachi Khomptti, was presented by A. Moraes, followed by Anton Marie's rendition of Bhau-Bhau (Brother-Brother). Rebello, the organizer of the event, had set aside an open space within the mattou (pandal) where spectators could stand and observe the performances. The event operated on a ticketed system, offering seating tickets priced at 1 rupee and 2 annas, while standing tickets were available for 10 annas. All tickets were sold out, indicating the event's triumph. It is worth noting that the intention of the event was not to foster competition, but rather to provide public entertainment. The audience thoroughly relished the performances, although no official awards were distributed. Nevertheless, the packed auditorium likely led attendees to form their own conclusions regarding which khell was superior, or perhaps perceive both as equally favourable. The significance of this day lies in the decision to bring the zomnivoilo khell, traditionally performed at ground level, onto the stage. This moment marked the initial stride towards the establishment of the khell tiatr, a theatrical tradition that would assume diverse names and forms, eventually even posing a challenge to the dominant Konkani tiatr in the entertainment realm. Rebello, A. Moraes, and Anton Marie Pereira were recognised for their collective efforts in propelling this significant advancement. \"Without their collaboration, this groundbreaking leap forward would not have been conceivable\", writes author Wilson Mazarello.\nThe zomnivoilo khell, a traditional theatrical performance, gained significant attention in the town of Tolleabandh, Benaulim. News spread that the khell had been performed on a stage, generating interest among those who had missed the initial show. However, organizing an immediate follow-up performance proved challenging for Rebello, the organizer, as both participating groups were already committed to other engagements. Despite this setback, the enthusiastic response from the audience encouraged Rebello to strive for an even more impressive production. In 1957, during the Carnaval season, Rebello collaborated with Anton Marie to stage two plays of his khell, Bhattkaracho Dusman (Landlord's Enemy) and Mauxechi Nossai (Aunt's Jealousy). A dedicated stage was constructed, complete with a traditional backdrop and seating arrangements. Rebello introduced stage settings and curtains, transforming the performance into a Konkani tiatr-like experience. The staged khells were showcased in various locations, including Sanvordem on 24 February 1957, Assolna on 2 March 1957, Agaçaim on 3 March 1957, and Vasco da Gama, Goa on 4 March 1957. Additionally, Rebello presented the same show at the Damodar Vidhya Bhawan in Margão. It is worth mentioning that Rebello continued to refer to the performance as \"Anton Marie-cheo Don khellacheo Parti\", with no evidence suggesting an alternate name. The introduction of khell performances on a theatrical stage sparked a wave of innovation among other khell contractors, with A. Moraes being one example. Inspired by Rebello's approach, these contractors began exclusively staging khells on a formal stage. Performances took the form of either a competition between two groups or two consecutive plays (don parti) by the same group. In the latter format, one play was presented before the intermission, and the other followed. The inclusion of stage settings and the shift towards staged khells marked an important evolution in this traditional art form, offering audiences a more visually engaging and immersive experience.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn his lifetime, Rebello was an agriculturist and farmer who lived in Maddar, Benaulim, Goa. Besides farming, he had a keen interest in bullfights and owned a prize-winning bull named Landdo. He was known for organizing bullfights and even coined the term \"Dhirio\" for these events, replacing the previous term \"Boilam Gheram.\" In 1966, he married Faustina Florina Rodrigues from Orlim, Salcete, with a civil registration in Margão followed by a church wedding in Benaulim. Their three sons, Luis, Agnelo, and Jack, have made a mark as musicians in the Konkani music scene. Rebello died at the age of 83 in Pulvaddo, Benaulim, on 2 December 2011.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "St. Mary Magdalene High School No. 10 in Lviv (Polish: Średnia Ogólnokształcąca Szkoła No 10 im. św. Marii Magdaleny) – founded in 1816 as Lviv Trivial School named after Mary Magdalene, now one of two high schools in Lviv with bilingual instruction in Ukrainian and Polish. The school does not have the status of a Polish minority school.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe school was founded in 1818 as an elementary school in the buildings of the former Dominican monastery next to the Church of St. Mary Magdalene, from which it took its patron saint. In 1846, the school was moved to private buildings on Leon Sapieha Street, when a hospital was set up in post-convent buildings. The school acquired a Polish character after the introduction of Polish as the official language in Galicia after 1869. In 1883, a new red brick building was built for the school.\nDuring the Polish-Ukrainian battles for Lviv in November 1918, an outpost of the Polish defense of the city under the command of Lieutenant Adam Świeżawski was stationed in the school building. During the German-Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939, the 1st Volunteer Scout Company was organized in the school building under the command of Lieutenant Zbigniew Czekański. In 1932, a new section, called the \"white school,\" was added to house the boys' section of the school. The school flourished under the direction of Mieczysław Opałek in 1934–1939.\nAfter the Second World War, more than 60 Polish schools in Lviv were closed, leaving only three open, including the Mary Magdalene School. However, the school had to move to a single \"white\" building, lost its patron and became known as High School No. 10.  Since the 1962/63 the school was downgraded to an elementary school. At the same time, a decision was issued to liquidate the Roman Catholic parish of St. Mary Magdalene in Lviv. The church building was transferred for use to the neighboring Lviv Polytechnic Institute, and the crosses were removed from the facade. The only Polish secondary school in Lviv remained School No. 24. School No. 10 was planned to be liquidated in subsequent years, and the school authorities managed to prevent this by organizing the Felix Dzerzhinsky Museum within its walls.\nAfter Ukraine regained its independence, the school became a secondary school again. In 2013 it regained the name of the Mary Magdalene School. In the 2014/15 school year, 183 Poles and 86 people with Polish roots attended the school, and 28 out of 31 subjects were taught in Polish. The school has 16 classrooms, a sports hall and a library. The school cooperates with other schools in Ukraine, where Polish is taught, and with several schools in Poland: VII Zofia Nałkowska High School in Kraków, School No. 83 in Warsaw, School No. 4 in Przemyśl, School Complex No. 1 in Swarzędz, and School No. 3 in Hajnówka.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nOlechowski, Piotr (2021). \"\"Nie wychowywać nowej inteligencji\".

        "content": "Boulevard Castilhos França, originally called Rua Nova do Imperador and Boulevard da República, is a street located in the Campina neighborhood, on the shores of Guajará Bay, in the Brazilian city of Belém, capital of the state of Pará. Created in 1848, it is one of Belém's first wide thoroughfares. In 1930, it was renamed Boulevard Castilhos França in honor of Navy Commander Eurico de Castilhos França.\n\n\n== History ==\nBoulevard Castilhos França is one of the first broad roads in the city of Belém. It started with the landfill of the Guajará Bay beach area, located next to the commercial customs house, and incorporated Art Nouveau elements. The works evolved from the enrichment of Belém during the golden age of rubber in the Amazon. At the end of the 19th century, during the Belle Époque period, urban interventions modernized the features of the street to reflect the new elite 's desire to appear progressive and connected in the European style. It had to overcome colonial standards with technical urbanism, applying hygienic and social control measures and distancing the poor from the urban limits.\nAt the time, the site featured constructions lined only on the left side and a series of wharves located on the shores of Guajará Bay, which became established after navigation opened up in the Amazon RIver. Boulevard Castilhos França is approximately 756.18 meter long. It starts at the old 15 de Agosto Lane, now Presidente Vargas Avenue, at 17 meters wide, and ends at the Companhia Lane, now Portugal Avenue, with a width of 10.67 meters.\n\n\n=== Historical heritage ===\nBoulevard Castilhos França integrates the architectural and landscape complex of Ver-o-Peso, listed by National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN) in 1977, which covers an area of 35,000 square meters and includes several historic buildings, including the Francisco Bolonha Municipal Meat Market, the Siqueira Campos Square, the Dock, the Açaí Fair, the Castle Slope and the Solar da Beira, the Estação das Docas and the Fisherman's Square.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCulture and tourism in Belém\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Santa Maria Assunta is the Roman Catholic church, located on Piazza Vittorio Emanuele in the town of Bientina in the province of Pisa, Tuscany, Italy. The church is near the city hall of the town.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThis church from the exterior looks plain. The initial church is documented since 1326, when it was listed as a pieve in a list in Calcinaia. In 1332, the archbishop  Simone Saltarelli granted it a baptismal font. According to a plaque in the church, initially the church was doted with relics of the apostle St Barnabas, St Blaise, and Sainte M. Catherine Martyr.  In 1628, reconstruction enlarged the parish and archbishop Silvani consecrated a new church on 10 April 1644. However a major impetus for its refurbishment was the translation on 6 June 1699 of relics of Saint Valentine the martyr (patron of Bientina), and thus becoming a goal of pilgrims seeking the saint's aide. They were moved here from the Catacomb of Callixtus in Rome.\nMajor refurbishments were begun in 1750, with the addition of the gilded and engraved wooden ceiling; in 1777, the walls had rococo stucco-work, and another major refurbishment was pursued in 1829. The interior is decorated with canvases from the 17th and 18th centuries. A recent restoration of the church took place in 1986. Attached to the church is a museum of Sacred Art displaying both robes and precious works from the church.\n\nThe main altarpiece depicting the Glory of St Valentine is attributed to Pier Dandini. An altarpiece depicting the Adoration of the Nave of Christ is attributed to Cesare Dandini.\n\n\n== References ==",

The beginning of a calendar year should preferably be the beginning of the Nile flood. It was associated very early with the appearance of the Sothis in the night sky. Therefore, the oldest documented calendars of Egypt also choose this event to determine the beginning of the year. This is also the case with the \"Sothis lunar calendar\".\nThe beginning of the month in Egypt was always considered to be the beginning of the non-visibility of the moon before sunrise, a month ended after the Old light. Thus, the Egyptian lunar calendars differed from those of many other cultures, in which a new month usually began with the new light.",

        "content": "The Lessinia Regional Park (Italian: Parco naturale regionale della Lessinia) is a nature reserve in Veneto, Italy. Established in 1990, it covers the northern part of the Lessinia region, in the Venetian Prealps, between the provinces of Verona and Vicenza. It is both a Special Protection Area and a Site of Community Importance.\nThe park stretches over 10,000 hectares in the territory of fifteen municipalities, thirteen of which belong to the province of Verona and the remaining two to the province of Vicenza; it encompasses all the mountains of the province of Verona, between 1,200 and 1,900 meters above sea level, except for Monte Baldo. The highest point of the park is the peak of Monte Zevola, 1,976 meters above sea level.\nAgroforestry and silvopasture have played an important role in shaping Lessinia, with much of its territory consisting of pastures – among the most extensive pasturages in the Italian Alps. Cows, sheep (including the Brogna, a breed unique to Lessinia), goats and horses are bred in the region.\nThe park's flora consists of hornbeams, oaks and chestnuts in the valleys, beeches and pines at higher elevations, and alders, mountain pines and rhododendrons at the highest altitudes. The fauna includes red deer, roe deer, chamoises, marmots, foxes, European hares, golden eagles, Eurasian eagle-owls, Western capercaillies, black grouses, hazel grouses, snow buntings, Alpine newts, and fire salamanders. Wolves, which had become extinct in the region in the first half of the 19th century, made their return in 2012, when Slavc, a male wolf coming from Slovenia, formed a breeding pair with Giulietta, a female coming from farther west in the Italian Alps; Giulietta gave birth to at least 42 wolves over the next decade, heavily contributing to the reintroduction of the species in the Eastern Alps.\nThe park was managed by the mountain community of Lessinia until 2019, when a body specifically tasked with its management was created, in compliance with a new regional law. In 2020, five municipalities proposed to cut the park's area by 2,000 hectares, claiming that the park imposed excessive restrictions and bureaucracy on agricultural activities; the proposal was approved by the regional council of Veneto, but dropped following massive protests by environmentalists, including a symbolic march by 10,000 people in the territory of Bosco Chiesanuova, where the seat of the park is located.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\n Media related to Parco naturale regionale della Lessinia at Wikimedia Commons",

It was the Italian section of the International Workers' Association (IWA) until it left it in 2018 and established the International Workers' Confederation (CIT)\n\n\n== History ==\nThe original Unione Sindacale Italiana (USI) was banned by the Fascist regime in 1925 and was forced to continue its activities in exile. Following the fall of fascism in Italy and the liberation of Rome, it merged with the Italian General Confederation of Labour (CGIL) on 9 June 1944.\nIn 1950 the CGIL split: the communist faction retained the original name and structure, while the Catholic faction established the Italian Confederation of Trades Unions (CISL) and the social democratic one established the Italian Labour Union (UIL). In 1953, a few anarchists also split from the CGIL and re-established the USI, but the group remained marginal and was only present in some of Italy's regions until the 1970s.\nDuring the protests of 1968, USI regained strength, thanks to the growth of left-wing movements outside of the Italian Communist Party (PCI); in 1983 it was finally able to celebrate its second National Congress.  The group also became affiliated with the International Workers' Association – Asociación Internacional de los Trabajadores (IWA–AIT), changing its name into \"USI - AIT\".\nThe group is currently present in various, but not all, Italian regions and remains faithful to the ideals of syndicalism and anarcho-syndicalism. Its affiliation to IWA–AIT was terminated in 2018, after which it established the Confederacion Internacional de los Trabajadores (CIT) and rebranded into \"USI - CIT\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Kilfinny (Irish: Cill na Fíonaí, meaning \"church of the wood\") is a civil parish and townland in County Limerick, Ireland. It is close to Adare and Croom in the historical barony of Connello Upper.\nEvidence of ancient settlement in the area includes a number of fulacht fiadh, holy well and ringfort sites in the townlands of Commons, Ballynakill and Kilfinny. Kilfinny Castle, an Elizabethan-era fortified house built on the site of an earlier tower house, was besieged during the Irish Rebellion of 1641. The coordination of the castle's defence, during the siege, is historically attributed to Elizabeth Dowdall.\nThe area's national (primary) school, known as Scoil Náisiúnta Ciarain or Kilfinny National School, had an enrollment of 53 pupils as of January 2024. St Kieran's church is in the Roman Catholic parish of Croagh-Kilfinny in the Diocese of Limerick. The current church is built on the site of an earlier late 18th-century chapel. The local Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) club, Croagh-Kilfinny GAA, was founded in 1903.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was originally built as a hunting lodge in the 16th century and subsequently extended in the late 19th century so that it now has three floors, four reception rooms, twelve bedrooms and four bathrooms. It is on a plot of 3.5 acres (1.4 ha) on high ground overlooking the Thames river.  \nIt was listed for protection as Grade II on 21 September 1987.\nThe author Kenneth Grahame lived here as a child after his mother died when he was five. The house belonged to his maternal grandmother, Mary Inglis, and he lived there for two years with her and his uncle, David, who was the curate of the parish church. The locality was influential in the creation of his writing such as The Wind in the Willows.\nOther famous people associated with the house include Sir Stanley Spencer, who painted a picture of it.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Zhangixalus thaoae, or Thao's tree frog, is a species of frog in the family Rhacophoridae found in Lào Cai province, northwestern Vietnam. It was described by Nguyen et al. in 2024 by specimens found in evergreen montane tropical forest at an elevation of about 1,883 meters above sea level. The species is named after the first author's wife, Nguyen Thi Thanh Thao, as a sign of gratitude for her support of research activities.\nIt mostly resembles Z. yaoshanensis but is distinguished by its smaller size (SVL 30.1–32.2 mm in males), coloration, and is genetically distant enough to be recognized as a separate species. Genetically, Z. thaoae is closest to Z. jodiae, Z. pinglongensis, and Z. yaoshanensis in the Z. chenfui group. According to the authors of the description, it is possible that in the future the species will be found in the evergreen forests of Guangxi province in southern China. Due to the lack of data on the species, the authors of the description recommended that the IUCN assign it Data Deficient status.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Al-Aidarous Gate, which is known by the Hadramis as Sidat Al-Aidrous, is considered one of the most prominent historical sites in the city of As-Shihr.\nIt was built between 1868 and 1888. It constituted a unique example for the Islamic gates in Hadramout. It was named after Imam Sheikh al-Aidarous to commemorate him and the nearby al-Aidarous Mosque. \nThe gate consists of three stories:\nThe first story includes the entry, which is about two and a half meters wide and four and a half meters high. Its entrance is closed by a thick wooden door of two equal sides.\nThe second story contains a wide room on the top of the gate at the middle of the building. In the two suites surrounding it, there are four rooms and two bathrooms. Every suite consists of two bedrooms and a bathroom. \nThe third story contains two surveillance rooms, in addition to a wall revolving around the roof at a height of one and a half meters. Today, the gate building is used as a media department and an office for the Antiquities, Museums and Manuscripts Authority.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Rafayel Tudu (Bengali: রাফায়েল টুডু; born 7 May 2001) is a Bangladeshi professional footballer who plays as a striker for Bangladesh Championship League club Fakirerpool YMC.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn in Godagari Upazila of Rajshahi District, Tudu hails from the ethnic Santal community. He began his football journey as a goalkeeper while training at the Kishore Football Academy in Rajshahi.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== Victoria SC ===\nIn 2020, Tudu began his professional league career as the third-choice goalkeeper for Victoria Sporting Club in the Bangladesh Championship League. He made 8 appearances, 4 of which were as a substitute during the 2020–21 league season as his club suffered relegation. He notably started as goalkeeper during the club's 0–6 and 2–8 defeats to NoFeL SC and Fortis FC, respectively. Eventually, he departed the club following his debut season.\n\n\n=== Fakirerpool YMC ===\nDuring both the 2021–22 and 2022–23 seasons of the Bangladesh Championship League, Tudu missed out, instead regularly training at the Kishore Football Academy. However, during a local tournament, Tudu showcased his skills as a striker, even scoring against his own academy team. Impressed by his performance, his academy coaches began utilizing him as an attacking player. This led to Fakirerpool Young Men's Club signing him for the 2023–24 Bangladesh Championship League, where Tudu would register as a striker, making his position change official.\nOn 19 February 2024, Tudu made his debut for Fakirerpool and scored in a 2–3 defeat to BFF Elite Academy during the league's opening game. On 16 April 2024, Tudu scored a brace as Fakirerpool defeated league leaders PWD Sports Club 4–1. On 7 April 2024, Tudu was man of the match, scoring all four goals as Fakirerpool defeated Uttara FC 4–1. His super hat-trick saw him overtake teammate Dalim Barman in the league's top scorer charts with 10 goals, with three games remaining.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n=== Club ===\nAs of 9 April 2024.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRafayel Tudu at Global Sports Archive",

        "content": "Currently, the state of São Paulo has 34 state parks, a category of conservation unit for integral protection of nature defined in the Law of the National System of Nature Conservation Units and classified as category II by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The basic objective of a state park is to preserve natural ecosystems of great ecological importance and scenic beauty, enabling scientific research and the development of environmental education and interpretation, recreation in contact with nature and ecological tourism. Among the state parks in São Paulo, 32 are managed by the Foundation for Conservation and Forestry Production of the State of São Paulo, which is linked to the Secretariat of the Environment of the Government of São Paulo. The other two parks, Albert Löfgren and Fontes do Ipiranga, are managed by the Forestry Institute and the Botanical Institute of São Paulo, respectively.\nThe first official state park was Campos do Jordão, created by Decree No. 11,908 issued on March 27, 1941, by Ademar Pereira de Barros. It was followed by Alto Ribeira Tourist in Iporanga, on May 19, 1958, and Jaraguá, on May 3, 1961, in the city of São Paulo. The smallest state park is the A.R.A., with just under 0.6 square kilometers, while the largest is the Serra do Mar, with over 3,000 square kilometers.\nThe two biomes found in the state are the Atlantic Forest and the Cerrado. Despite the considerable number of state parks, they protect less than 8,000 square kilometers of native vegetation. 30.4% of the city of São Paulo is covered by remnants of the Atlantic Forest, including large fragments in the Cantareira, Parque do Carmo and Parelheiros regions. The Jacupiranga, Serra de Paranapiacaba and Juréia-Itatins mosaics, composed of important state parks, also are UNESCO World Heritage Sites (Atlantic Forest Reserves of the Southeast).\nFrom the original 33,979 square kilometers of Cerrado, less than 3,000 square kilometers remain (less than 1% of São Paulo's territory). Less than 0.5% is in conservation units, including state parks, which measure 50 square kilometers.\n\n\n== State parks ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Atlantic Forest conservation units\nNational System of Nature Conservation Units\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Celimpilo Ngema (born 12 September 1997) is a South African soccer player who plays as a midfielder for AmaZulu in the South African Premier Division.\nHe was born in Melmoth. He was on the Uthongathi team that won promotion from the 2016–17 SAFA Second Division. Ngema also received a Player of the Tournament as well as a Young Player of the Tournament award. The club aimed to fight for promotion from the National First Division. He was on trial with Chippa United in the winter of 2019, and by the 2019–20 season, Ngema was considered Uthongathi's star player.\nNgema left Uthongathi in 2020. As Chippa United reportedly made a R150,000 bid, the deal was not finalized, and Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) bought Ngema instead. With TTM, Ngema helped win the 2020–21 Nedbank Cup, and proceeded to lose the 2021–22 Nedbank Cup final. He remained in the squad after the club license was purchased by Marumo Gallants, and played the 2021–22 and 2022-23 CAF Confederation Cup for Gallants, scoring several goals.\nWith half a year left of his contract, Ngema was reported to have signed a \"pre-contract\" with AmaZulu during the winter of 2023. There were still rumours of a transfer to other clubs. Marumo Gallants also ended up being relegated from the 2022-23 South African Premier Division, though Ngema was crowned as Player of the Year in the club's internal end-season gala. The move to AmaZulu went through in the summer of 2023. Ngema and the club notably had a slow start to the 2023-24 South African Premier Division.\n\n\n== References ==",

The highest placement they reached is the top 9 finalists in 2021, obtained by Celia Torres.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter Vicente Gonzalez acquired the license of Miss Grand Spain in 2015, he began franchising the provincial competitions to individual organizers, who would name the provincial representatives to compete in the national pageant the following year. In the province of Córdoba, the first provincial contest of Miss Grand was organized in 2017, and a model Natalia Flores was named the first Miss Grand Córdoba elected through the pageant. Previously, Córdoba once participated in Miss Grand Spain 2016, but its representative was determined via an audition.\nSince 2017, the pageant has been held annually, with delegates from different municipalities in Córdoba participating.\n\n\n== Editions ==\nThe following table details Miss Grand Córdoba's annual editions since 2017.\n\nNotes\n\n\n== National competition ==\nThe following is a list of Córdoba representatives who competed at the Miss Grand Spain national pageant.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Miss Grand Spain at Wikimedia Commons\nMiss Grand Spain official website",

She is known for being the companion of Saint Martha during the Christianization of the current French region of Provence.According to the Golden Legend, Marcella would have been a Christian servant of the brothers Marthe, Mary and Lazarus of Bethany, together with Sarah and Maximinus, also Christians. In the work \"The Gospel as It Was Revealed to Me\" by Maria Valtorta, Marcella was responsible for announcing the agony of Lazarus and witnessing the resurrection of Jesus together with other women.When the persecution of Christians in the Holy Land began around the year 44, Marcella, Sara, Maximinus and the brothers of Bethany were thrown into the Mediterranean Sea in a boat without oars that arrived in what is now the French commune of Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer. Along with them, other Christians: Mary Magdalene, Mary of Clopas and Mary Salome. Some versions also include Susanna, Joseph of Arimathea and Sidonius in the group.In French territory, the group was welcomed by herders from the region, however they decided to separate to propagate the deeds of Jesus in different places. Marcella accompanied Marthe during her preaching in the ancient Roman province of Viennensis, near the city of Marseille, and later in Avignon, allowing herself to be guided above all by prayers during the evangelization of those people.Her relics rest with Maximinus, Sidonius and Susanna in the Basilica of Saint Mary Magdalene, in Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume. Her memory is celebrated annually on January 31 by the Provençals.\n\n\n== See also ==\nJesus at the home of Martha and Mary\nMyrrhbearers\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Üsh Zhüz (Kazakh: Үш Жүз, lit. 'Three Hordes') was a Kazakh socialist political party. Founded in the wake of the Central Asian revolt of 1916 and the Russian Revolution of 1917, the party supported Pan-Turkism, federal republicanism and land reform. It was opposed to the Alash party, which aligned with the White movement, while Üsh Zhüz itself aligned with the Bolsheviks and eventually merged into the Communist Party of Turkestan. Some of its leading members, including Turar Ryskulov, became prominent figures within the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (TASSR).\n\n\n== History ==\nDuring the Central Asian revolt of 1916, the Kazakh activist Mukan Aitpenov established the newspaper Alash in order to publicise support for the proposal of Alash Autonomy. It ceased publication during the Russian Revolution of 1917, by which point Aitpenov had dropped support for the Alash party and moved to establish a new political party.\nÜsh Zhüz was established in Omsk in November 1917, and later moved its headquarters to Tashkent. Its leader was Kölbai Tögisov, a member of the Kazakh intelligentsia with a \"shady reputation\". The party's political programme blended together elements of anarchism, socialism, Pan-Turkism, and Pan-Islamism. Its stated aim was the unification of all Turkic peoples in the former Russian Empire into a federal republic. The party drew its support base largely from southern Kazakhs, with southern leaders such as Turar Ryskulov, Saken Seifullin, Amankeldı İmanov, Alibi Zhangildin all supporting it.\nIt was the main opposition to the Alash party, a liberal democratic and nationalist party, largely drawn from northern Kazakhs, that was aligned with the White movement. Points of disagreement between Alash and Üsh Zhüz included issues of land reform, Central Asian autonomy and the role of Islam in politics. Üsh Zhüz was among a number of radical Muslim parties, including the Milliy Firqa, Young Bukharans and Muslim Socialist Committee of Kazan, that sided with the Bolsheviks against the White movement in the Russian Civil War. In order to counter White influence in Kazakhstan, in 1918, the Bolsheviks formed an alliance with Üsh Zhüz. Over time, the party's positions moved closer to those of the Russian communists, purging members of the petite bourgeoisie from its ranks.\nBut the party's conception of Islamic socialism isolated it from the Kazakh masses, which were more inclined towards the political moderates. The party ultimately failed to gain a substantial following in Kazakhstan and, after the establishment of the Kazakh Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic, many of its members merged into the Communist Party. Ryskulov continued to promote pan-Turkism, in spite of Bolshevik aversion to the regional unity of Central Asia. By the end of the civil war in 1922, Ryskulov himself declared that the Alash Autonomy had been a legitimate representative of Kazakh interests, breaking from the Bolshevik line that it was a \"tribal-nationalist\" creation. Southern Kazakh leaders subsequently adopted the educational and land reform programmes of the Alash Autonomy, pushing for them within the new Soviet government.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==",

        "content": "Swainsona minutiflora is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae and is endemic to South Australia. It is a prostrate, herbaceous plant with imparipinnate leaves with 5 to 9 oblong or narrowly oblong leaflets with the narrower end towards the base, and racemes of 3 to 7 yellow or pinkish flowers.\n\n\n== Description ==\nSwainsona minutiflora is a prostrate herb with several stems mostly up to 5–10 cm (2.0–3.9 in) radiating from a tap root. Its leaves are imparipinnate, 22–55 mm (0.87–2.17 in) long with 5 to 9 oblong or narrowly oblong leaflets 6–8 mm (0.24–0.31 in) long and 2.0–2.5 mm (0.079–0.098 in) wide on a hairy petiole. There is a tapering linear to narrowly triangular stipule 2–4 mm (0.079–0.157 in) long at the base of the petiole. The flowers are arranged in racemes with 3 to 7 flowers on a peduncle mostly 40 mm (1.6 in) long, each flower 4–5 mm (0.16–0.20 in) long on a pedicel 1.5–2.0 mm (0.059–0.079 in) long. The sepals are 2.0–2.5 mm (0.079–0.098 in) long, the sepal lobes shorter than the tube. The petals are yellow, or pinkish, the standard petal about 4 mm (0.16 in) long and wide, the wings 4.0–4.5 mm (0.16–0.18 in) long, and the keel 4–5 mm (0.16–0.20 in) long and 1.0–1.5 mm (0.039–0.059 in) long and 1.0–1.5 mm (0.039–0.059 in) deep. Flowering has been observed in August and October and the fruit is 15–23 mm (0.59–0.91 in) long and 3 mm (0.12 in) wide containing about 8 more or less square seeds about 1.5 mm (0.059 in) long.\n\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\nSwainsona minutiflora was first formally described in 1948 by Alma Theodora Lee in Contributions from the New South Wales National Herbarium, from specimens collected by Max Koch  in Mount Lyndhurst in 1899. The specific epithet (minutiflora) means \"very small flowers\".\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThis species of pea grows in the North-west, Lake Eyre and Flinders Ranges bioregions of South Australia.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Sevakunj Hostel, a historic landmark in Aram Bagh Road, Rambagh Quarter, Karachi. The building was erected in the 1910s by an affluent Hindu family.\nThe building of the Sevakunj Hostel, resembling a flawless square, is arranged around a courtyard. Rooms in the two-story structure are positioned around this central space. The building boasts symmetrical adornments on all four sides, with each side divided into two halves featuring central window openings. Every room includes a balcony bordered by wrought iron grilles, upheld by stone brackets. The building boasts minimal yet refined exteriors adorned with a series of long windows. Its layout is distinctive, featuring a central courtyard instead of an open compound. This courtyard served as a communal area within the hostel and hosted university events.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== British Raj ===\nThe name \"Sevakunj\" originates from the Sanskrit words Seva and Kunj, meaning \"Service Grove\". The builders of the hostel were the Shahani family, a prominent Sindhi-Hindu family active in education. The hostel accommodated not only local students but also a significant number of international students.\n\n\n=== Post-independence ===\nIn the 1980s, due to violent clashes between student groups, Sevakunj Hostel and several neighbouring student accommodations had to close their doors. Sevakunj Hostel had been serving as a residence for students, especially those enrolled at NED College/University and later Dawood Engineering College, until the early 1990s.Despite its central location near Pakistan Chowk, once revered as the educational heart of the city and home to numerous historic structures, the building now stands abandoned. In 1997, it was designated as a protected site under the Sindh Cultural Heritage Preservation Act of 1994.\n\n\n== See also ==\nJinnah Courts, another former hostel\nMitha Ram Hostel\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "NGC 4096 is a spiral galaxy in the constellation Ursa Major. The galaxy lies about 35 million light years away from Earth, which means, given its apparent dimensions, that NGC 4096 is approximately 80,000 light years across. It was discovered by William Herschel on March 9, 1788.\nNGC 4096 is a spiral galaxy visible with an inclination of 76°. Although the presence of a bar has been suggested, it hasn't been proven. The galaxy has multiple well-defined thin arms. NGC 4096 is asymmetric in the north–south axis, with the northern half having stronger CO emissions and asymmetric HI and H-alpha emissions following a lopsided spiral arm. The total stellar mass of the galaxy is estimated to be (6.13±0.1)×109 M☉. The star formation rate of the galaxy is estimated to be between 0.22 and 0.43 M☉ per year.\nTwo supernovae have been detected in NGC 4096. SN 1960H was a type Ia-pec supernova which had an apparent magnitude of 14.5 at discovery. SN 2014bi was a low-luminosity type II-P supernova with magnitude 18.2 upon discovery. The spectrum indicated it was about two weeks post maximum and significantly reddened.\nGarcia in 1993 considered the galaxy to be a member of LGG 269 group, along with NGC 4111, NGC 3938, NGC 4051, and NGC 4138. On the other hand, Makarov et al. consider the galaxy to be a member of the Messier 106 Group, along with Messier 106, NGC 4242, NGC 4248, NGC 4288 and NGC 4460. The group is part of the Local Supercluster.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nNGC 4096 on WikiSky: DSS2, SDSS, GALEX, IRAS, Hydrogen α, X-Ray, Astrophoto, Sky Map, Articles and images",

        "content": "Dawid Szwarga (born 7 October 1990) is a Polish professional football manager and former player who manages Ekstraklasa club Raków Częstochowa.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nThe son of a former midfielder Mirosław, Dawid Szwarga followed in his father's footsteps and began his footballing career at a hometown club MOSiR. In 2008, he joined Ekstraklasa club Odra Wodzisław Śląski but made no senior appearances, only featuring for their Młoda Ekstraklasa side. He would go on to play for II liga and III liga clubs from the Silesia area such as GKS Jastrzębie, Pniówek Pawłowice, Szczakowianka Jaworzno, Nadwiślan Góra and Skra Częstochowa. In 2012, he went on trial to top division side Korona Kielce.\nIn total, Szwarga made 29 third division appearances, scoring once, and 147 fourth division outings, during which he managed 10 league goals, before retiring after multiple short stints with lower division clubs.\n\n\n== Managerial career ==\n\n\n=== Assistant at GKS Katowice ===\nSzwarga began his coaching career in June 2018, when he was recommended by Jakub Dziółka to join Jacek Paszulewicz's staff at GKS Katowice. As a match analyst and assistant coach, he was also responsible for conducting training sessions for the senior team. During his three years in Katowice, he also worked under managers Dariusz Dudek and Rafał Górak.\n\n\n=== Raków Częstochowa ===\nOn 14 June 2021, he was recruited by Ekstraklasa club Raków Częstochowa as their new assistant manager, working with Marek Papszun. During his stay there, Raków won the 2021–22 Polish Cup, the 2021 and 2022 Polish Super Cups, and finished the 2021–22 league season as runners-up. On 26 April 2023, while Raków was en route to their first ever top division title, a week after Papszun confirmed he would be leaving the club at the end of the 2022–23 season, Szwarga was announced as his replacement.\nSzwarga's first match as manager came on 11 July 2023, with Raków winning 1–0 over Estonian club Flora in the first qualifying round of the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League, followed by a 2023 Polish Super Cup loss to Legia Warsaw 4–5 on penalties four days later. In their European campaign, the defending Ekstraklasa champions would go on to eliminate Qarabağ and Aris Limassol, before falling short in the play-off round to Danish club Copenhagen, losing 1–2 on aggregate.\nHaving qualified for UEFA Europa League group stage, Raków faced off against Italian side Atalanta, Portuguese club Sporting and Austrian club Sturm Graz, winning once against the latter, drawing at home to Sporting and losing the remaining games, finishing their first ever European group outing in the last place.\n\n\n== Managerial statistics ==\nAs of match played 13 April 2024\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Decauville railway in Delphi was a 3 km (1.9 mi) long 500 mm (19+3⁄4 in) gauge light railway used from 1892 to 1903 on the archaeological excavation site of the ancient temple complex of Delphi in Greece.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Great Excavation of Delphi (French: La Grande Fouille de Delphes) began in 1892 under the auspices of the French School of Athens (École française d'Athènes). To facilitate the transport of spoil from the excavation sites to the dumps, a narrow-gauge railway network with a total length of 1.8 km (1.1 mi) and a track width of 500 mm (19+3⁄4 in) was built between July and September 1892. A further 1.2 km (0.75 mi) of track was gradually built by 1897, bringing the total length of the network to 3 km (1.9 mi). The zig-zag route was necessary as the tracks were laid on terrain with large differences in height. The Decauville railway of Delphi and its extensions are shown on the sophisticated topographical plan by French engineer Henry Convert, as highlighted in red. After the end of the excavations in 1903, the portable track was dismantled and transported to the island of Delos, where it was used in combination with the V tip waggons for the excavations that had just begun.\n\nThe excavation of the sanctuary of Apollo was only possible after the expropriation and relocation of the village of Kastri. It is one of the most important sites of Greek cultural heritage and has gained its place at the top of the list of ancient sites.  The excavation brought to light many astonishing remains, including around three thousand important inscriptions describing public life in ancient Greece. Today, the Greek Archaeological Service, in collaboration with the French School of Athens, continues to explore, excavate and preserve the Delphic sanctuaries.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Gabriele Maria Visconti was born an illegitimate child in 1385 from the relationship of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, Duke of Milan, with Agnese Mantegazza. Upon his father's death in 1402, when he was sixteen years old, he inherited the Lordship over Pisa and other neighboring territories; he also inherited the Lordship over Crema and Sarzana. All these lordships were assigned to him in appanage as a vassal of his legitimate half-brother and new Duke of Milan, Giovanni Maria Visconti, who was fourteen at the time and therefore under the regency of their mother Caterina Visconti.\nIn 1405–1406, the young Duke of Milan, Giovanni Maria, found himself in difficulty after the departure and death of his mother, so he asked for help from his half-brother Gabriele Maria. He was then entrusted with the governance of the city, but Gabriele Maria, disagreeing with Giovanni, soon abandoned Milan.The Florentines, sworn enemies of Gian Galeazzo, immediately after his death sent their armies against the territories of Pisa and Siena, but these armies, engaged only in raiding the countryside, could not prevent the young Gabriele Maria from descending into Tuscany, entering Pisa, and officially taking possession of it. Meanwhile, the Visconti domains were crumbling under the ambitions of various powers and local lords, who took over the different cities that had escaped the governance of Duchess Caterina. Among these was Crema, Gabriele Maria's personal appanage, which the Benzoni family took over in 1403.\nMeanwhile, the Florentines maintained their ambitions over Pisa and sought to exploit the discontent caused in the population by Gabriele Maria who, after imposing new taxes, had sent some wealthy citizens to death to seize their assets, after accusing them of conspiring against him. In January 1404, Florence therefore sent against Pisa a body of cavalry and some companies of infantry, but this small army found the city well defended and therefore had to retreat.\nGabriele Maria Visconti, fearing that the Florentines would return with greater forces, asked for help from the French. At that time in Italy was the famous Jean II Le Meingre, known as Boucicaut, who governed the Republic of Genoa for the King of France. Visconti obtained the hoped-for help by declaring himself a vassal of the King of France and promising the annual tribute of a horse and a falcon. After this act, Boucicaut ordered the Florentines to withdraw any threat on Pisa and, having the order had no effect, imprisoned all the Florentine merchants who were in Genoa, also seizing all their goods. Florence did not wish to attract the wrath of the king of France, so it concluded with the governor of Genoa and with Gabriele Maria himself a four-year truce, which provided for the cession of Livorno to Florence, against a large compensation, therefore the Florentines turned to punish the Tuscan feudatories who, during the war against Gian Galeazzo, had sided with the latter.\nHowever, Florence continued to want possession of Pisa. The Florentines, while keeping faith with the truce agreements, fueled the difficulties in which Boucicaut, hated by the Genoese for his exorbitant governance, was struggling, hoping to profit from it. For his part, Boucicaut, not feeling too secure in Genoa and wishing to obtain the alliance of Florence, induced Gabriele Maria Visconti to negotiate with his mediation with the Florentines, to sell them Pisa itself. Therefore, soon after, the so-called \"market of Pisa\" opened, according to an expression of the time. The negotiations were secretly started in Genoa and continued in Vico Pisano. Having heard of it, the Pisans took up arms against their lord and forced him to take refuge in the city fortress (21 July 1405). Despite this, Visconti continued the negotiations and agreed with Florence on the cession of the fortresses and castles in his power, also selling all his rights as lord of Pisa, reserving only the possession of Sarzana and other lands in Lunigiana.\nIn the meantime, Boucicaut intervened, arriving in Pisa with two galleys and three hundred men; it is unclear whether due to a misunderstanding or an ambush, one of the ships was boarded as soon as it entered the Arno River, and the crew was taken prisoner. Boucicaut then withdrew, not wishing to unleash a large-scale war, for which he probably could not have counted on the help of France. Florence thus acquired the lordship of Pisa from Gabriele Maria (who had meanwhile retired to Sarzana) for 200,000 gold florins (of which three-fifths went to Boucicaut, the rest to Visconti); acquiring the city, with its port, Florence had its own access to the sea, thus being able to compete with Genoa, but the passage to Florence was not well received in Pisa, where another insurrection broke out, to which the Florentines responded by laying siege, which ended with the conquest of the exhausted city.\nIn the following years, a heterogeneous coalition formed against French interests in Italy: the Visconti of Milan, the Malaspina of Lunigiana, Theodore II, Marquess of Montferrat, and the Ghibelline exiles of Genoa, well represented even within the city walls by numerous personalities and power groups. Initially, Boucicaut was able to react vehemently to the threat, acting with fierce determination internally, and externally waging war on the Malaspina; Gabriele Maria Visconti himself, indicated in correspondence as one of the leaders of the plot, was lured into a trap by Boucicaut, with the promise of settling his compensations on the sale of Pisa and Livorno; he was then imprisoned by him on charges of treason and shortly thereafter put to death by decapitation in 1408.\n\n\n== Descendants ==\nJacopo Visconti (ca. 1405 - post 1446), natural child and legitimized by his uncle Filippo Maria, Duke of Milan in 1429, invested with Tortona and Valenza in 1429; he married Caterina Rossi of the Counts of San Secondo.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

It is located in Faqir Jo Goth near Thatta city \n\n\n== History ==\nSri Chand travelled to Sindh in the second half of the 16th century during the reign of the Tarkhan dynasty and lighted dhuni at Faqir Jo Goth. At that time, Thatta was under the rule of Mirza Baqi Baig, Tarkhan ruler of Sindh (1554–1591), who was infamous for his oppressive and tyrannical reign. Baba Siri Chandar bravely spoke out against the atrocities committed by Mirza Baqi. The shrine was built at the place of dhuni to commemorate Sri Chand's visit.\nThe shrine was also visited by Baba Bankhandi. After spending some time here before moving to  Sadh Belo, which became his permanent abode, and where he spread the thought and ideology of Baba Srichand.\n\n\n== Architecture & Composition ==\nThe temple's stone architecture, features approximately 24 living quarters, a vast dining hall known as Bandharo, and expansive prayer rooms housing the idols. It was built 500 years ago on a sprawling two-acre site.\nIn the courtyard, a 50-foot wooden flag adorned with colorful cloth, known as Jhando Sahib, was raised. Each year, on the 22nd day of Bhadun in the Hindi calendar, the Jhando Sahib was taken down and reinstalled by a Muslim family from Aamu Mallah.\nThe shrine houses Granth Sahib, Bhagvad Gita, icons of all Sikh Gurus and portraits of  Hindu deities. Within the temple, there resides a 6-foot statue of Kanwar Bhagat, a revered mystic singer from Sindh. Tragically, he was assassinated during the pre-Partition violence while aboard a train near Ruk railway station, close to Sukkur.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is raced over 2200m from a mobile start and is a slot race.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Race by Grins was first held in 2022. It involves each potential race entry (slot) being sold to a purchaser (slot holder) who secures a spot in the race for three years. The slot holder may then liaise with the trainers and owners of high quality racehorses that may potentially fill the slot and contest the race.  The slot holders will enter into independent arrangements with the horse owners/trainers in regards the distribution of any prize money won.\nIn 2022, one of the horses was withdrawn prior to the fields being drawn. From 2023 the Race by Grins has a pool of horses available from which slot holders can select a replacement for any horse withdrawn prior to acceptance time. There will also be one emergency drawn in the field.\nGrins, the initial race sponsor is a ready-to-drink alcoholic beverage associated with New Zealand rugby representatives Stephen Donald, Anton Lienert-Brown and Damian McKenzie.\nIt was intended to introduce a trotting version of the slot race in 2023 but this did not occur due to a lack of funding.  However, in 2024 an inaugural trotters slot event, the TAB Mobile Trot was held for a stake of $600,000   The two slot races have attracted the best combined fields of New Zealand and Australian horses for many years. \nThe 2024 edition was won by Merlin in a time of 2:35.1 which set a new New Zealand record for the 2200m journey beating the previous record of 2:35.4 by Ultimate Sniper in November 2019.\n\n\n== Race results ==\nThe past winners of the race are as follows:\n\n\n== Other major races ==\nAuckland Trotting Cup\nDominion (harness race)\nNew Zealand Trotting Cup\nNew Zealand Free For All\nRowe Cup\nInter Dominion Pacing Championship\nInter Dominion Trotting Championship\n\n\n== See also ==\nHarness racing\nHarness racing in New Zealand\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "NGC 4157 is a spiral galaxy in the constellation Ursa Major. The galaxy lies about 55 million light years away from Earth, which means, given its apparent dimensions, that NGC 4157 is approximately 125,000 light years across. It was discovered by William Herschel on March 9, 1788.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nNGC 4157 seen nearly edge-on, with an inclination of 84° based on CO imaging. The total stellar mass of NGC 4157 is (2.92±0.04)×1010 M☉, while the dust mass is estimated to be 2.1×107 M☉. The hydrogen disk of NGC 4157 is symmetric and slightly wrapped, indicating no strong interaction with other galaxies, and extends to twice the size of the optical disk. The total HI mass in the galaxy is estimated to be 109.72 M☉.\nThe star formation rate of the galaxy is 1.76±0.18 M☉ per year. A star formation area is visible beyond the end of the optical disk and is also visible in X-ray and ultraviolet imaging. It could probably be the result of a recent accretion.\nThe galaxy has radio emission extending above and below the optical disk, indicating the presence of a radio halo. There is also radio emission extending southwards from the north-eastern end of the disk.\n\n\n=== Supernovae ===\nThree supernovae have been observed in NGC 4157: SN 1937A (mag. 16.2), SN 1955A (mag. 16), and SN 2003J. SN 2003J was a type II supernova which had an apparent magnitude of 16.7 upon discovery.\n\n\n== Nearby galaxies ==\nNGC 4157 is the foremost galaxy of the NGC 4157 Group. Other members of the group include NGC 4085, NGC 4088, UGC 6992, and UGC 7176. UGC 7176 is a companion of NGC 4157, lying 12 arcminutes away. The group is part of the Ursa Major Cluster, a large association of mostly spiral galaxies lying north of the Virgo Cluster, that is part of the Local Supercluster. NGC 4157 is one of the dominant galaxies in the cluster, along with NGC 3769, NGC 3877, NGC 3992, NGC 4111, NGC 4217 and NGC 4346.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nNGC 4157 on WikiSky: DSS2, SDSS, GALEX, IRAS, Hydrogen α, X-Ray, Astrophoto, Sky Map, Articles and images",

        "content": "Absolute Standards Inc. is a chemical company that makes chemical samples for use in calibrating laboratory testing equipment. The company is suspected to be a supplier of execution drugs for the Federal government of the United States.\nAbsolute Standards is not registered with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), nor is it registered as a controlled substances manufacturer with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Therefore, despite allegedly producing ingredients for lethal injections, Absolute Standards is not authorized to produce drugs for human consumption.\n\n\n== Products ==\n\n\n=== Calibration Chemicals ===\nAbsolute Standards advertises itself as producing over 2,000 calibration chemical products designed to assist with the testing and analysis of instruments used in laboratories, and claims to ship their products to all fifty U.S. states, several territories, and over thirty countries.\n\n\n=== Pentobarbital ===\nAbsolute Standards applied to be registered as a bulk manufacturer of pentobarbital on September 29, 2018, and again on August 25, 2021, according to Drug Enforcement Administration notices. The first notice stated that the company planned to bulk manufacture the substance for distribution to customers, while the 2021 notice mentioned that the company intended to bulk manufacture the controlled substances \"for internal use and sale to its customers.\"\nApart from its use in lethal injections, pentobarbital can also treat tension, anxiety, insomnia, epilepsy, and other seizures. Additionally, it can be used to help patients relax before surgery.\n\n\n== Investigations ==\nIn 2020, Reuters suspected that Absolute Standards, based on a letter signed by Democratic Party members of the US House Oversight Committee, was the manufacturer of a raw, powdered form of pentobarbital for the Justice Department. According to Reuters, the department has confirmed hiring a pharmacy to mix this powder into a sterile, injectable solution. When asked about the claims, Stephen Arpie (Director) told Reuters that they \"don't know what the final intended use\" of their products is going to be.\nOn a 2024 episode of the television series Last Week Tonight, Absolute Standards was again accused of supplying pentobarbital to the federal government. This claim was based on information from a confidential source and a Freedom of Information request filed with the DEA in 2020. The processing of this request was significantly delayed, reportedly due to the documents being \"related to the death penalty,\" according to an agency liaison.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Siege of Myawaddy was a significant military engagement that occurred in early 2024, during the ongoing conflict in Myanmar. The siege took place in the town of Myawaddy, located on the eastern border with Thailand.\n\n\n== Background ==\nMyawaddy serves as a vital border town for overland trade between Myanmar and Thailand. The military junta, which seized power in Myanmar in 2021, faced escalating attacks by ethnic Karen insurgents, supported by other anti-coup factions. The Karen National Union (KNU), in particular, had been engaged in a struggle for self-rule since Myanmar's independence in 1948.\n\n\n== Events ==\nSince December 2023 Karen forces have targeted junta forces in Kawkareik as well as the Hpa-An–Myawaddy road, which is part of the Asian Highway 1.\nThe siege began with weeks of sustained attacks by ethnic Karen insurgents on military positions in and around Myawaddy. After a prolonged siege and several days of negotiations, on 5 April over 600 junta soldiers stationed in Myawaddy agreed to surrender to the KNU and withdrew across the border to Mae Sot/ leaving only the 275th Light Infantry Battalion (LIB), positioned near the town's western entrance, to defend the town. \nOn 7 April, junta officials fled into Thailand. The junta requested Thailand for a military flight from Mae Sot to evacuate certain officials and others awaiting refuge on the border.\nKNLA and PDF troops were seen at the Thai–Myanmar Friendship Bridge border crossing in northeastern Myawaddy on the morning of the 9 April. Later that afternoon, the KNLA and PDF launched a heavy assault on the LIB 275th base. Fighting ended late the next day, when the KNLA and PDF captured the LIB 275th base. Over 200 junta soldiers withdrew to another bridge on the border. In response, Thailand deployed the 3rd Army along the border. The junta began sending reinforcements in a counteroffensive to retake the town, but were stalled in Kyondoe. On 12 April, Thai officials and the KNU spokesperson confirmed the capture of Myawaddy. The junta retaliated with airstrikes despite locals stating that the KNLA were not in the streets of the town.\n\n\n== Impact ==\nTrade through Myawaddy had already been declining due to clashes in neighboring areas. Official figures from the Myanmar junta's Ministry of Commerce showed a significant drop in trade value between April 2023 and February 2024. The ongoing conflict between the military and anti-regime forces further exacerbated the decline in trade, affecting both legal and unofficial border trade routes.\n\n\n== References ==",

DX Mail is a subsidiary of the Freightways Group.\nNew Zealand is one of only a few countries that allows private enterprise to provide postal services. As such, DX Mail is in direct competition with New Zealand Post, New Zealand's national postal service. The DX Mail delivery network is mostly limited to areas within New Zealand's cities and satellite towns, and passes on any mail lodged through its system for addresses it cannot cover to New Zealand Post.\nOwing to New Zealand's liberal postal laws, it is one of two privately owned mail delivery providers in the country to issue official postage stamps, the other being Whitestone Post.\n\n\n== Services ==\nDX Mail posties primarily deliver using a motorcycle and deliver their rounds five days a week. The company claims this is an advantage over the delivery service offered by main competitor New Zealand Post, which delivers three days a week.\nAside from standard delivery services, DX Mail operates exchanges similar to PO Box lobbies. This enables its customers to send mail and parcels overnight to other customers in the DX Mail network. \nThe \"Branchlink\" service provides overnight delivery of documents between branches of the same firm.\nBeginning in 2021 in Palmerston North, DX Mail has overseen delivery and ballot collection services for several New Zealand local government elections, which are done by postal vote.\n\n\n== References ==",

Ankur Tewari helmed the curation, alongside the collaboration of poet and lyricist Kausar Munir and music producer K. J. Singh.\n\n\n== Artists ==\n\n\n=== Vocalists ===\n\n\n== Revival & Production ==\n\n\n=== Revival ===\nEight years after its last season aired on MTV India, Coke Studio made its return to the Indian music scene in February 2023. Spearheaded by Coca-Cola India, this revival took on the name Coke Studio Bharat. The reintroduction hinted at a shift towards celebrating India's diverse musical heritage. Coke Studio Bharat aimed to contemporize the show by facilitating fresh collaborations among a variety of artists. Unlike its previous partnership with MTV India, this edition was exclusively focused on digital platforms, with individual songs being released instead of full episodes. Despite these format changes, Coke Studio Bharat remained true to the show's essence - showcasing unique artist pairings accompanied by a house band and additional musicians.\n\n\n=== Production ===\nA team consisting of Ankur Tewari, music producer K. J. Singh, and lyricist Kausar Munir curated the artist selection and musical direction for the season. Universal Music India handled all aspects of marketing, distribution, and production. Filming took place at Filmistan Studios in Mumbai, with Colosceum Media Pvt. Ltd. managing the visual production.\n\n\n== Songs ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Boddington Camp is an Iron Age hillfort, about 1 mile east of Wendover in Buckinghamshire, England. It is a scheduled monument.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe fort is on the summit of Boddington Hill. There is a single rampart and outer ditch, in an oval measuring about 500 by 220 metres (1,640 by 720 ft), oriented north-east to south-west. The interior, area about 6 hectares (15 acres), is heavily wooded. The defences have been destroyed in the north-east, and nothing remains of the probable main entrance here to the fort.In the south and east, where the defences are most noticeable, the bank is about 1.7 metres (5 ft 7 in) above the interior and up to 3.4 metres (11 ft) above the outer ditch. On the western side, a modern forestry track overlays the outer ditch. At the south-west there is an entrance ramp, thought to be original. A gap on the north-west side is probably modern.Pottery fragments of the 2nd to the 1st centuries BC were found during an excavation of a section through the rampart near the southern entrance.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHillforts in Britain\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Boddington Camp at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "An Abe Divided is the fifth episode  of the third season of The Ren & Stimpy Show that originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on 18 December 1993.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nRen and Stimpy are in Washington D.C. where they are hired as security guards to safeguard the Lincoln Memorial. Ren learns about a rumor that there is a fortune in gold hidden in the head of the Lincoln Memorial and decides to steal it. Ren closes the Lincoln Memorial and along with Stimpy saw off the head of the Lincoln Memorial. Instead of gold, Ren and Stimpy find caramel corn. Fearful of losing their jobs, Ren and Stimpy try to replace the head of Lincoln, but all their attempts fail. The ghost of Abraham Lincoln appears to kick both Ren and Stimpy for all the destruction they have wrought. Sergeant Bigbutt learns of the head of the Lincoln Memorial has been smashed and replaces it by dressing up Ren and Stimpy as Lincoln.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of Billy West\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nSergeant Bigbutt-voice of Jack Carter\nStreet bum-voice of Billy West\nPigeon-voice of Billy West\n\n\n== Production ==\nAn Abe Divided was the second episode directed by Jim Gomez. Unlike Circus Midgets, Gomez was far more interested in An Abe Divided. The story for An Abe Divided was a homage to the Laurel and Hardy films. The lay-out for An Abe Divided were done by Michael Kim assisted by Donald Shank, Tom McGrath and Steve Loter. Many of the cartoonists who worked on An Abe Divided were novices and the production suffered because of their inexperience.Kim stated: \"It was actually a bigger struggle to rectify that. We had a crew of layout artists that were really green; they'd just be pouring in, and our schedules would be really tight because of that. The thing you learn is that it is a business and there's no infinite budget. So when you have a lot of these artists that are soaking in the budget, your schedule gets tight\". Jim Ballantine stated that An Abe Divided was \"a schedule disaster\" due to the inexperience of many of the artists, and that An Abe Divided took 12 weeks to complete the lay-out stage in the summer of 1993. An Abe Divided was completed in six weeks by the Rough Draft Korea studio in Seoul in what was by all accounts a rushed production.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe American journalist Thad Komorowski gave An Abe Divided three stars out of five, and wrote that the episode was a \"fan favorite\".\n\n\n== Books and articles ==\nDobbs, G.

        "content": "Eldorado is a municipality in the Mexican state of Sinaloa. It is located about 55 kilometres (34 mi) south of the state capital of Culiacán. Its creation from the municipality of Culiacán was approved in 2021 and it will become operational on 1 November 2024.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe municipality of Eldorado is located at the mouth of the San Lorenzo River in central Sinaloa. To the north and the east, it borders the sindicaturas or administrative subdivisions of Costa Rica, Quilá and Emiliano Zapata in the municipality of Culiacán. It borders the Ensenada de Pabellones lagoon, a Ramsar site, to the west; and the Gulf of California to the south. Eldorado has a desert climate.\n\n\n== History ==\nOn the San Lorenzo River just north of the present-day municipal seat of Eldorado is the site of Navito, which was inhabited by the Sabaibo and Tahue peoples in pre-Hispanic times. The Spanish expedition of Nuño de Guzmán reached Navito in 1531 and founded the settlement of San Miguel nearby, although they soon moved their settlement to present-day Culiacán.\nIn 1856, Joaquín Redo y Balmaceda and his wife Alejandra de la Vega acquired lands around Navito, where they built a textile factory named El Coloso and a sugar mill named La Aurora. In 1900, the Redo family built a new sugar mill named Eldorado, which gave its name to the surrounding settlement. In 1917, Eldorado became a sindicatura or municipal subdivision of Culiacán. The writer Inés Arredondo spent her childhood summers in Eldorado.\nThe idea of establishing an independent municipality of Eldorado first appeared in the 1970s, but various attempts to achieve this had failed before the movement was rekindled in 2020. Finally, on 5 March 2021, the Sinaloa state congress approved the elevation of the sindicatura of Eldorado in the municipality of Culiacán to an independent municipality. The decree establishing the municipality went into force on 23 March 2021.\n\n\n== Administration ==\nEldorado will hold its first elections as an independent municipality in 2024. The municipal government of Eldorado will consist of a municipal president, a councillor (Spanish: síndico), and six trustees (regidores), three elected by relative majority and three by proportional representation. Eldorado is administratively subdivided into four sindicaturas respectively headquartered at the localities of Eldorado, Leopoldo Sánchez Celis, Las Arenitas, and Guadalupe Victoria.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nIn the 2020 Mexican Census, the localities that now comprise the municipality of Eldorado recorded a population of 46,628 inhabitants. The municipal seat, also named Eldorado, recorded a population of 14,772 inhabitants in the 2020 Census. The next largest localities in the municipality are Leopoldo Sánchez Celis and Guadalupe Victoria, which recorded populations of 3411 and 2288 respectively in the 2020 Census.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nEldorado's economy relies on agriculture irrigated by the San Lorenzo River; commerce; and fishing, in particular shrimp farming. Sugar has been cultivated in Eldorado since 1900, and the its sugar mill is the only one still operating in Sinaloa today.\nEldorado has several beaches that serve as tourist attractions.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nEchavarría, Esperanza (1982).

        "content": "The Book of Ayn is a novel by Australian writer Lexi Freiman. It was published by Catapult in November 2023.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe novel's main character, Anna, is a 39-year-old novelist who is cancelled after she writes a satirical novel about the opioid epidemic in the United States. She finds solace in the individualist egoism of Ayn Rand. In an attempt to emulate Rand, who worked for several years as a screenwriter, Anna moves to Los Angeles and attempts to write a television sitcom featuring an animal character named \"Ayn Ram\". After falling behind on her TV writing and becoming addicted to Adderall, Anna abandons Rand's ideas. She goes to a Greek commune, where she attempts to experience ego death.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn a review for The New Yorker, Katy Waldman compares The Book of Ayn to the earlier novel Two Girls, Fat and Thin by Mary Gaitskill, which focuses on a woman who follows a Rand-like character. Waldman says that both novels \"mock their characters, but they also argue that egoism can be nourishing and even generative\". In The Washington Post, Maddie Crum praises Freiman's skill for writing comedy. In the Los Angeles Times, Ryan Chapman calls the book \"one of the funniest and unruliest novels in ages\".  The novel was also reviewed in Kirkus Reviews, The New Republic, The New York Times, and The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nInterview with Freiman about the novel, by Christopher Bollen in Interview magazine",

        "content": "Horaclupea is an extinct genus of freshwater and estuarine ray-finned fish that inhabited the Indian subcontinent from the latest Cretaceous to the early Eocene. It was a clupeid, making it related to modern herrings and anchovies. It was named after Indian ichthyologist Sunder Lal Hora, who described the first species of the genus.\nIt contains two species:\n\n†H. geei (Hora, 1937) - early Eocene of the Salt Range in Kohat District, Pakistan (syn: Clupea geei Hora, 1937)\n†H. intertrappea Borkar, 1973 - latest Maastrichtian of the Intertrappean Beds near Bamanbore, India\nH. geei was initially described as Clupea geei from multiple specimens, one relatively complete, in an Eocene estuarine fossil fish assemblage discovered near Malgin in Kohat District, Pakistan. H. intertrappea was described in the new genus Horaclupea from several articulated specimens from freshwater sediments in the Intertrappean Beds of India. These formations were initially dated to the Late Paleocene or early Eocene, but have been more recently dated to the latest Cretaceous or earliest Paleocene. \nThe abundance of H. geei in estuarine sediments, in addition to the occurrence of H. intertrappea in freshwater sediments, suggests that Horaclupea may have been an anadromous taxon that migrated up rivers to breed and schooled in large shoals. It was initially suggested that H. geei may represent the young stage of a hilsa-like clupeid, but the lack of any adult specimens in the Kohat assemblage, as well as the presence of similar individuals in the Intertrappean Beds, indicates that it may just represent a small-sized clupeid species. \nIt was described as being potentially related to Diplomystus, but that taxon has since been classified into a different order (Ellimmichthyiformes). However, recent taxonomic reviews have retained Horaclupea as an indeterminate clupeid. \n\n\n== References ==",

The premiere took place on January 17, 2019, as part of the Max Ophüls Prize film festival in Saarbrücken, where the film won the Audience Award for Feature Film. The Austrian cinema release took place on June 13, 2019. The film was released in cinemas in Germany on July 4, 2019. The film was first broadcast on ORF on July 9, 2021.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nNadja, hailing from Russia, resides in Vienna, employed as an interpreter for the oligarch Igor. Despite Igor's grandiose plan to construct a luxurious villa akin to Florence's Ponte Vecchio on the Schwedenbrücke, Nadja endeavors to dissuade him. Meanwhile, Nadja's confidante, Vera, inadvertently supports Igor's scheme through her Austrian husband Klaus, who betrays Nadja's trust. Sensing betrayal, Teresa, the nanny of Nadja's children, proposes gathering evidence of Igor and Klaus's misdeeds. Klaus capitulates to Igor's demands for funding and citizenship, unbeknownst to him that Teresa and Nadja are onto his schemes.\nAs the scandal unfolds, Vera uncovers Klaus's hidden wealth in Liechtenstein. Following Klaus's dismissal by Igor, a bribery scandal ensues, implicating Zech in the process. While Zech denies involvement, evidence mounts against him. Nadja plays a pivotal role in exposing the corruption, ultimately leading to Vera reclaiming the hidden millions. In the aftermath, they revel in their friendship and newfound prosperity.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nMargarita Breitkreiz: Nadja\nDarya Nosik: Vera\nSabrina Reiter: Teresa\nMikhail Evlanov: Igor\nGeorg Friedrich: Klaus\nSimon Schwarz: Ferdinand\nJoseph Lorenz: Stadtrat Hans Zech\nRobert Finster: Don\nSonja Romei: urologist\nChristoph Dostal: neighbour\nDavid Oberkogler: policeman\nSusanne Gschwendtner: policewoman\nLukas Johne: Leopold\nAurelia Burckhardt: Liechtenstein bank teller\nDominic Marcus Singer: border guard\n\n\n== Production ==\n\nFilming took place in Vienna and Lower Austria in October and November 2016.

        "content": "The Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Land Problems in Mogoditshane and Other Peri-Urban Villages, also known as the Kgabo Commission, was a 1991 commission of inquiry established by the government of Botswana. It was created to investigate allegations that illegal sale and purchase of land was taking place in peri-urban villages such as Mogoditshane without the authorisation of land boards. It published its findings and recommendations in the Kgabo Report, which found that due to housing shortages and a failure of the land board system, most land sales in Mogoditshane were unauthorised.\nThe commission caused a major political scandal when it implicated Vice-President Peter Mmusi and Minister of Agriculture Daniel Kwelagobe, both of whom held leadership positions in the dominant Botswana Democratic Party (BDP). They resigned from their positions, but the party reelected them as party leaders in the subsequent congress. The accusations against Mmusi and Kwelagobe were declared void by the High Court of Botswana because they were not granted a hearing to defend themselves. The scandal prompted two factions to form within the party, those who supported Mmusi and Kwelagobe and those who opposed them, and these factions dominated politics in Botswana for the next two decades.\n\n\n== Background ==\nBotswana underwent a period of significant urbanisation in the 1980s, causing the expansion of peri-urban villages around major cities. New residents moved to these villages faster than land was being allocated and housing was being constructed, leading to shortages. The system of land boards used to allocate land in Botswana were facing criticism, compelling the government to act.\nIt was alleged that there were violations of the Tribal Land Act and that misconduct had taken place regarding the land allocation of peri-urban villages, particularly in Mogoditshane. Residents, unable to engage in land sales because of shortages and an overburdened system, circumvented the land board and carried out the sales illicitly. Many residents were suspected to be holding land illegally, and court challenges by the local land board saw mixed results in determining ownership and delivering eviction notices.\n\n\n== Commission ==\n\n\n=== Inquiry ===\nTo address allegations of illegal land sales, an investigation was opened by Peter Mmusi, who held the dual role of Vice-President of Botswana and Minister of Local Government, Lands and Housing. A government evaluation of the Tribal Land Act found that land boards had insufficient staff and elected tribal representatives, and it recommended the removal of tribal chiefs' personal representatives. Mmusi then requested that the President of Botswana, Quett Masire, form a commission of inquiry regarding illicit land deals. The commission was to be headed by Englishman Kgabo, who was a respected figure in the party and had been a member since its founding. It was established on 25 July 1991, and proceedings took place over the following five months.\n\n\n=== Findings ===\n\nThe Kgabo Commission published its findings in the Kgabo Report. The commission confirmed that land deals were often carried out without authorisation from the land board. It identified 841 illegal lots in Mogoditshane with a high likelihood that there were others, and it estimated that over 90% of the village's ploughing fields had been illegally subdivided and had residential structures installed. In many cases, land allocated to specific tribes was sold to people who were not residents of the tribe, including people who were not citizens of Botswana.\nThe commission blamed the spread of unauthorised land deals on the government's inability to carry them out in a timely manner, and many buyers and sellers believed that this justified their actions. Many also disagreed that their land was under the land board's jurisdiction if their ownership predated the land board's creation. Others deceived buyers by selling land that they did not own.\nPeople who were questioned during the inquiry confirmed that those engaged in the land deals included high ranking government officials. During its proceedings, the commission discovered that the minister of agriculture, Daniel Kwelagobe, had circumvented the land board by requesting that Vice-President Mmusi use his office as Minister of Local Government, Lands and Housing to acquire the lands for him. Mmusi then directed the land board to accept the request against procedure. The commission also found that the involvement of high ranking figures such as Mmusi and Kwelagobe encouraged violations among the public. In addition to their government positions, Mmusi was the chairman of the BDP and Kwelagobe was the party's secretary-general. The commission concluded that Mmusi had acted inappropriately when he upheld Kwelagobe's appeal to obtain land in Nkoyaphiri, but had not done anything explicitly illegal.\n\n\n=== Recommendations ===\nThe commission recommended that land board staff should receive more training, two specific land boards should be dissolved and recreated with new staff, villages should more carefully determine who they send as tribal representatives, peri-urban villages involved in planning legislation should receive dedicated sub-boards, chiefs' personal representatives should play a greater role in land board affairs, the government should exert more control over who serves on land boards, the jurisdiction of land boards should be clarified under the law, penalties for unauthorised land deals should be codified and enforced by the customary courts, the government should seize all illegally purchased land while compensating landowners for any development on the seized land, and that landowners residing on the land be given three months to depart. It suggested offering equivalent land elsewhere as an alternative form of compensation if the landowner wished, in line with the Tribal Land Act's provision that this is acceptable compensation during eminent domain.\nThe commission challenged the ruling in Kweneng Land Board v. Kabelo Matlho and Others. The court had ruled that land boards had no jurisdiction over certain cases of private land ownership. The commission recommended that an appeal of the case include an argument that any land allocated by a chief prior to the land board's establishment was legally equivalent to a land board allocation and therefore under the land board's jurisdiction. It considered the implications of the case \"too ghastly to contemplate\".\n\n\n== Government response ==\nThe government drafted a white paper that endorsed most of the commission's recommendations. It differed in some areas, rejecting the dissolution of any land boards and arguing that tribal chiefs' representatives should have less influence instead of more. It also proposed that violations of the Tribal Land Act be prosecuted through customary law in specially created land tribunals instead of through statutes in court. To address the subdivision of lots, the government amended the Tribal Land Act to repeal Section 10 (2), which had been the subject of Keneng Land Board v. Kabelo Matlho and Others. It also implemented new penalties for violating the law in Section 39.\nParticularly controversial was the recommendation that illegal landowners be compensated for development, which the government rejected both due to the extensive cost (approximately 79% of the land was developed) and because of a lack of bureaucratic infrastructure to determine land value or to manage improvements such as housing. As evicting 4,000 people would create a homelessness crisis, and given that the government was partially responsible for the land shortages, President Masire pardoned everyone who had engaged in illegal land deals. Instead, the government determined that landowners should be allowed to keep developed land after paying a fine of 5,000 pula, with seizure and compensation then considered otherwise. This offer was not extended to non-citizens. It is believed that many landowners who had illegally purchased land began development once the government's position was announced.\n\n\n== Political scandal ==\n\n\n=== Resignation of Mmusi and Kwelagobe ===\nBoth the BDP and the opposition condemned Mmusi and Kwelagobe for their engagement in illegal land deals once the Kgabo Report was tabled for consideration, describing their actions as corruption and abuse of office. Students and trade unions organised protests. President Masire was a long-time ally of both Mmusi and Kwelagobe, and he had been friends with Mmusi for many years. As the situation escalated in March, Masire went on a diplomatic trip to Japan until 5 March.\nThe political pressure convinced Mmusi and Kwelagobe to resign from their respective cabinet and party leadership positions. Kwelagobe announced his resignation at the conclusion of a budget report during a legislative session, and Mmusi resigned shortly thereafter. Both became backbenchers in the legislature with little direct political power. Mmusi recommended Ponatshego Kedikilwe as his replacement. Instead, Masire appointed a relative unknown, Festus Mogae, as the new vice-president days later on 9 March. His reasoning was that Mogae was not affiliated with either of the factions that were developing within the party.\n\n\n=== Political and legal challenges ===\nMmusi and Kwelagobe insisted that the commission had been filled with political enemies as part of a conspiracy to oust them from the BDP. They attributed blame to a faction led by Mompati Merafhe, which included Roy Blackbeard, Chapson Butale, David Magang, and Bahiti Temane. These men came to be known as the Big Five. In contrast to the Big Five, Mmusi and Kwelagobe came to be known as the Big Two. Kwelagobe was on good terms with the commission's chairman Kgabo, and he believed that Kgabo had little actual power during the proceedings. Some of Mmusi and Kwelagobe's supporters alleged that the Big Five was engaging in regionalism as Masire, Mmusi, and Kwelagobe were all southerners, though the Big Five also had southerner members and the Big Two has significant support in the north.\nMmusi and Kwelagobe sued the government, arguing that the commission had violated the Commission of Inquiry Act by holding closed proceedings. They argued that they were entitled to a hearing before being implicated. In response, the BDP suspended Mmusi and Kwelagobe from the party entirely. Masire had discouraged them from taking legal action, feeling that any challenge to the government was also a challenge to the party. In another attempt to restore their standing in the party, Mmusi and Kwelagobe travelled across Botswana to speak to other members of the BDP and regain their support.\nThe lawsuit occurred at the same time as the party's 1993 national congress in Kanye. Mmusi and Kwelagobe argued that they had the legal right to challenge the election of party officials, but the BDP argued that the action against the government was separate from the party's internal processes. Despite expectations of a Big Five victory, Mmusi and Kwelagobe did well in the party's internal vote and reclaimed their previous party positions as chairman and secretary general. This congress is remembered as the Kgola Disana (transl. cut tree stumps). The High Court of Botswana ruled in favour of Mmusi and Kwelagobe on 26 August 1994 and declared the implications against them null and void.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe Kgabo Commission coincided with other political scandals, including those at the Botswana Housing Corporation, the National Development Bank, and the distribution of supplies to primary schools. These scandals raised questions about what was previously seen as a country without meaningful corruption. The scandal surrounding the Kgabo Commission was one of the factors that led to the establishment of the Directorate on Corruption and Economic Crime in 1994. The bill had received criticism from some members of the BDP, who had been implicated in the Kgabo Report.\nThe Kgabo Commission marked the beginning of factionalism that came to dominate the BDP. The inter-party conflict hurt the party electorally in the 1994 general election, allowing the Botswana National Front to win several seats and challenge the BDP as a major opposition party. Mmusi died shortly before the 1994 election. He was replaced in the Big Two by Kedikilwe, and their faction became known as Barata-Phathi. The Big Five took Jacob Nkate as an additional leader and became known as the A-Team. Mogae's appointment as vice-president meant that he succeeded to the presidency at the end of Masire's term. Mogae and his successor Ian Khama both formally denounced factionalism were but generally understood to favour the A-Team. The factions that sprang from the Kgabo Commission remained the dominant forces in the BDP until 2010, when Barata-Phathi split to form the Botswana Movement for Democracy in protest of Khama's governance.\nFurther investigations produced evidence that illicit land deals were an ongoing problem. Mogae introduced the Lesetedi Commission in 2004, which served a similar purpose investigating land trading in Gaborone. This investigation also uncovered corrupt land dealings by government officials. When Jacob Nkate become minister of lands and housing, he became known for his willingness to raze illegally held lands in Mogoditshane, such that bulldozers came to be known as the \"yellow monster\" among locals. Illegal land deals and corruption were still common around land boards as of 2023.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nIsaacs, Senwelo M; Manatsha, Boga Thura (2016). \"Will the Dreaded 'Yellow Monster' Stop Roaring Again?: An Appraisal of Botswana's 2015 Land Policy\".

        "content": "Tietasaura (meaning \"Tieta lizard\") is an extinct genus of elasmarian ornithopod dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous Marfim Formation of Brazil. The genus contains a single species, T. derbyiana, known from a single incomplete femur. Tietasaura is notable for being the first ornithischian dinosaur ever named from Brazil.\n\n\n== Discovery and naming ==\nThe Tietasaura holotype specimen, NHM-PV R.3424, was discovered in 1906 during a series of expeditions by London's Natural History Museum to South America, lasting from 1859 to 1906. Some of the fossils found during these trips were described in publications in 1860 and 1907. This particular fieldwork was conducted along a beach near the Bahia-São Francisco Railway in the city of Salvador in Bahia, Brazil. This locality belongs to the Marfim Formation of the Recôncavo Basin. The specimen, which consists of the distal end of left femur, is among the first dinosaur remains found in South America. While it is now confidently regarded as belonging to a dinosaur, early observations labeled the bone as belonging to \"Hyposaurus sp.\" (a dyrosaurid crocodyliform) in the collections of the Natural History Museum, and the museum's digital collections inaccurately list it as a specimen of Sarcosuchus hartti (a pholidosaurid crocodyliform).\nIn 2024, Bandeira et al. described Tietasaura derbyiana as a new genus and species of elasmarian ornithopod based on these fossil remains. The generic name, Tietasaura, combines \"Tieta\"—the name of the main character in the Brazilian novel Tieta do Agreste—and \"saura\" (σαύρα), the feminine declination of the Greek word \"sauros\", meaning \"lizard\". The name \"Tieta\" is also a nickname for \"Antonieta\" in Portuguese, which means \"priceless\"; the describing authors use this meaning to reflect the specimen's value as the first ornithischian named from Brazil. The specific name, derbyiana, honors geologist Orville A. Derby and his contributions to paleontology in Brazil.\n\n\n== Classification ==\nIn their phylogenetic analyses, Bandeira et al. (2024) recovered Tietasaura as an ornithopod member of the Elasmaria, as the sister taxon to Notohypsilophodon. Their results are displayed in the cladogram below:\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Laura Fernández de Arteaga y Mantecón-Pacheco (1845 – December 14, 1900) was First Lady of Mexico and also the first Mexican woman to seek to get legally divorced. She was married to General Manuel González Flores, who served as President of Mexico from 1880 to 1884, and separated from him in 1878, while he was still President.\nBorn into a wealthy family in Oaxaca, Mantecón was well-educated. She married González, a widower, in 1860, and they had two sons, Manuel and Fernando. Her husband was known for his dissolute lifestyle, frequently visiting brothels. Throughout their marriage, Mantecón endured physical and financial abuse. Moreover, González had numerous extramarital affairs, fathering several children whom he later acknowledged.\nIn 1885, Mantecón filed for what would be the first divorce case in Mexico at the second chamber of the civil court. Although she personally drafted all documents presented to the court, she was represented by Juan Cordero.She went on to establish a school, a guest house, studied homeopathy abroad, became a seamstress, and opened a women's clothing store. However, her husband continued to harass her and sabotage her ventures. Neither relatives nor friends offered her any assistance, and she spent her final days in solitude, estranged from her children, and living in poverty.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nThe Fernández de Arteaga Mantecón family, which had established roots in Oaxaca de Juárez since the early 17th century, was well-connected through broad familial, commercial, political, and financial networks in that part of Mexico. Mantecón was born into this affluent family in 1845. Her father, José Manuel Simeón Fernández de Arteaga y González, was a lawyer and politician from Mexico City (born February 18, 1810, died March 27, 1855), who also served as the Governor of Oaxaca from 1846 to 1847. Her mother, Josefa Mariana Mantecón-Pacheco y Santibáñez (circa 1811 - August 31, 1872), was a devoted housewife from Oaxaca.\nLaura chose to use the Mantecón surname because it was more prestigious, following a common custom among women of that era to choose between their paternal or maternal surnames. The wealthy Fernández de Arteaga Mantecón family ensured that all their children received proper educations; Mantecón was notably well-educated, which was quite rare for women of her time.\n\n\n== Marriage and family ==\nIn September 1860, Mantecón, who was fifteen at the time and described as \"of medium height, with very feminine features, slim, light green eyes, a slightly sad gaze, sensual lips, and very delicate neck and hands,\"  married the Lieutenant Colonel of the Conservative Army, Manuel González. González, a handsome man twelve years her senior, had been widowed earlier that year from his second wife, a woman with the surname Vázquez. From the González Mantecón union, two sons were born, both of whom pursued military careers: Manuel González Mantecón (March 20, 1863 - April 9, 1913) and Fernando González Mantecón (July 6, 1865 - January 25, 1937).\nAfter getting married, Mantecón and González initially settled in a small apartment on the second floor of an old building on Calle Mesones in the Historic center of Mexico City, situated above a dairyshop, a bookshop, and a tortilleria. Later, they moved to General González's country estate named El Moquetito in Tamaulipas. There, according to one of their descendants, Mantecón wore trousers and worked in the fields, giving instructions to the builders and workers on the property. They lived happily there for three years before returning to the capital, shortly after General González went off to war. From then on, Mantecón would search for him whenever he was captured or injured, and she would petition the relevant authorities—including on one occasion, President Benito Juárez — for permission to personally oversee his recovery and care.\n\n\n== Marital life ==\nLaura Mantecón never enjoyed a happy marriage with González, who was infamous for his debauched lifestyle. His wild parties and orgies in brothels and at friends' homes were well known among both the society and the press. It is said that he even brought over two French women and a Circassian, all proficient in the erotic arts, setting up the latter at his Chapingo hacienda, showing complete disregard for his wife.\nFrom the beginning of their marriage, Mantecón suffered physical abuse – on two occasions, as she would later explain, González caused her to have miscarriages. She was also deprived of financial resources needed for survival and was frequently humiliated. Once, when she went to collect General González from the battlefield, he yelled at her, accusing her of only coming because she hoped he was dead so she could be free to find someone else. Ironically, it was González who had committed adultery; while married to Mantecón, Gozález engaged in both fleeting and serious relationships with women of ill repute and from distinguished families, even fathering children with some, whom he openly recognized.He even accommodated his mistresses in the family residence in Peralvillo. Perceiving Mantecón as an obstacle to his affairs, he exiled her to Cuernavaca, instructing her not to return to the capital. When Mantecón defied these orders due to inadequate financial support from González, he reacted with anger and denied her entry to their home, relegating her to a residence in Tacubaya   that lacked basic amenities; it did not even have a kitchen. During his presidential tenure from 1880 to 1884, González lived with another woman in the Peralvillo house, which he previously shared with Mantecón. To avoid harming González's political career, Mantecón chose to separate rather than take legal action, moving out in 1878. She lived independently for seven years, and after González's presidential term ended in 1885, she filed for divorce\n\n\n=== Divorce ===\nThe divorce proceedings between Mantecón and González were highly publicized. Mantecón handwrote the court documents herself. In them, she stated that since their marriage, she often had to work or seek help from relatives because her husband neglected her. She stated she personally witnessed her husband's disgraceful behavior with their housemaids on various occasions. She complained about her husband's vices, passions, and erotic urges. She also stated González was known for his irascible nature and foul temper; he was indecent and rude to her both privately and publicly. She testified he physically abused her, causing significant injuries that required medical attention. Furthermore, he exposed her to significant risks by sending her on dangerous paths frequented by bandits and deserters, often only accompanied by low-ranking soldiers who failed to respect her.González, on the other hand, blamed Mantecón as the primary cause of his personal and professional misfortunes.During his presidency – after Mantecón had formally separated from him -, González leveraged his position to transfer marital assets into his name and enacted changes to the Civil Code designed to disadvantage Mantecón and other women seeking redress from abusive husbands.The 1884 amendment to the Civil Code by Manuel González introduced provisions intended to weaken the legal standing of women like Mantecón, who dared to challenge their abusive spouses. Despite facing overwhelming societal norms and a powerful, wealthy opponent, Mantecón courageously pursued justice. González responded by evicting her from their home, alienating her children, cutting off her financial support, and tarnishing her reputation.Mantecón struggled to find a lawyer willing to represent her nor anyone willing to testify against González. Her sister, brother-in-law, and even her godfather, Porfirio Díaz, all refused to testify against González. The civil court judge handling Mrs. Mantecón's case was reportedly influenced by González, resulting in a biased proceeding in his favor. Undeterred, Mantecón escalated her case to a higher court, personally redrafting the legal documents by hand. Her goal was legal separation from her husband, while guaranteeing access to her children, and securing alimony.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nDuring the lengthy legal proceedings, Laura Mantecón, then 40 years old, sought ways to support herself as González refused to provide for her. Initially, she established an elementary school on Empedradillo Street, now known as Calle Monte de Piedad near the Zócalo. However, the teachers working with her resigned due to official harassment. She then opened a guesthouse, strictly requiring couples to prove they were legally married. Facing continuous interference from authorities in her endeavors, Mantecón moved to the United States and studied homeopathic medicine in New York. After returning to Mexico, she was unable to practice medicine because women were not allowed to do so; thus, she turned to sewing and opened a women's clothing store, declaring, \"I know how to live on the earnings of my honest work without begging for what rightfully belongs to me\".Mantecón's attempts to secure her livelihood faced official reproach; the judge rejected her divorce petition on the grounds that she had embarrassed her husband by establishing businesses and traveling abroad without his consent. Ultimately, Mantecón lost her case; the courts attributed her actions to mental illness, emotional instability, pathological jealousy, and a desire for revenge, and denied her the divorce. As a result, she was left without a home, family support, or financial means, while her husband continued to expend considerable wealth. Although her two sons, who were in the military, offered financial assistance, she declined, asserting that it was General González's responsibility to support her.\n\n\n== Death ==\nLaura Mantecón passed away on December 14, 1900, in Mexico City at the age of 55. Her funeral at the Panteón de Dolores lacked the customary accolades typically given to the spouses of prominent politicians. In contemporary discourse, Mantecón is still sometimes blamed for allegedly harming and discrediting General González.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Raleigh Magazine is a small and primarily woman-run magazine based in Raleigh, North Carolina. Founded in 2015 by Gina Stephens, the magazine primarily reports on culture, dining, and entertainment in the city and surrounding communities. Work conducted by the magazine has been cited by larger local news broadcasters, including The Herald-Sun, The News & Observer, and WRAL, and has gained notability for its ranked list articles.\n\n\n== Founding and leadership ==\nThe magazine was founded in September 2015 by Gina Stephens. Prior to starting Raleigh Magazine, Stephens had been involved in the media industry for over thirty years. Alongside Stephens as the magazine's Publisher, there are six other leadership positions: being the Editor-in-Chief, headed by Melissa Howsam, Associate Editor, headed by Lauren Kruchten, Editorial Assistant, headed by Anna Beth Adcock, Account Executive, headed by Debby Serena and Cameron Rhinehardt, and Creative Director, headed by Liz Reed. Freelance writers and photographers, as well as interns, are also employed to help produce work for the magazine. Their headquarters is located on 6511 Creedmoor Road, Suite 207, Raleigh, NC 27613.\n\n\n== Format ==\nThe magazine primarily covers topics relating to culture, dining, and entertainment stories in Raleigh, alongside some longer in-depth journalism. The magazine produces ten physical prints each year, and publishes daily digital stories on average. The physical prints have a subscription fee of \"$10 for 10 issues\", or can be acquired for free at over 200 locations around Raleigh. The magazine often publishes lists relating to Raleigh, such as ranking local cuisine or Raleighites. These ranked lists have been reviewed by larger local news agencies like The News & Observer. Physical prints of the magazine have also been reviewed on-air by WNCN, and announcements and work produced by the magazine have been referenced by The Herald-Sun, The News & Observer, and WRAL. Outside of publishing, Raleigh Magazine has in the past hosted a charity walk to raise money for ALS research and treatment. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nMeet the Media: Raleigh Magazine A 50-minute interview conducted by the Raleigh Public Relations Society with Raleigh Magazine Publisher Gina Stephens and Editor-in-Chief Melissa Howsam",

        "content": "The 2011 Wisconsin Spring Election was held in the U.S. state of Wisconsin on April 5, 2011.  The featured race at the top of the ticket was a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which was seen as an early referendum on the policies of the newly inaugurated governor, Scott Walker.  Several other nonpartisan local and judicial offices were also decided on the April ballot, including mayoral elections in some of Wisconsin's larger cities—Green Bay, Madison, and Racine.  Republicans' preferred candidate, incumbent justice David Prosser Jr., won the Supreme Court election by a narrow margin that resulted in a contentious recount.  The 2011 Wisconsin Spring Primary was held February 15, 2011.\n2011 also saw the first set of recall elections incited by Governor Scott Walker's controversial 2011 Wisconsin Act 10, which stripped public employee unions of their collective bargaining rights.  Nine state senators faced recall in the Summer of 2011, with two Republican seats flipping to Democratic control.\nFive special legislative elections were also held in 2011 to fill vacancies in the Wisconsin State Assembly.\n\n\n== State offices ==\n\n\n=== Legislature ===\n\n\n==== State Senate recall ====\n\nNine Wisconsin state senators were subjects of coordinated recall efforts to remove them from office in the Summer of 2011.  The first recall election was held on July 19, six were held on August 9, and two more were held on August 16.  Two incumbents, Randy Hopper and Dan Kapanke, were defeated in the recall.  The net result was that Democrats reduced the Republican Senate majority to 17–16.\n\n\n==== State Assembly 60th district special election ====\nA special election was held in Wisconsin's 60th Assembly district on May 3, 2011, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Mark Gottlieb to become secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Transportation.  The Republican nominee, Cedarburg school board member Duey Stroebel, defeated the Democratic nominee, Rick Aaron.\nA special primary was held concurrent with the Spring general election, April 5, 2011.  In the Republican primary, Stroebel narrowly prevailed over Cedarburg town supervisor Gary Wickert and a field of five other candidates, including Paul Melotik.\n\n\n==== State Assembly 83rd district special election ====\nA special election was held in Wisconsin's 83rd Assembly district on May 3, 2011, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Scott Gunderson to accept a job at the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.  The Republican nominee, Dave Craig, defeated Democratic nominee James Brownlow.\n\n\n==== State Assembly 94th district special election ====\nA special election was held in Wisconsin's 94th Assembly district on May 3, 2011, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Michael Huebsch to become secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Administration.  The Democratic nominee, La Crosse County board chairman Steve Doyle, defeated Republican nominee John Lautz.  This was a net gain for the Democrats.\nA special primary was held concurrent with the Spring general election, April 5, 2011.  In the Democratic primary, Doyle won a close election over American Red Cross executive director Cheryl Hancock.  In the Republican primary, Lautz defeated four other candidates.\n\n\n==== State Assembly 48th district special election ====\nA special election was held in Wisconsin's 48th Assembly district on August 9, 2011, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Joe Parisi to become Dane County executive.  The Democratic nominee, Planned Parenthood executive Chris Taylor won the special election without opposition.\nA special primary was held on July 12, 2011, in which Taylor defeated five opponents.\n\n\n==== State Assembly 95th district special election ====\nA special election was held in Wisconsin's 95th Assembly district on November 8, 2011, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Jennifer Shilling, who had been elected state senator in a recall.  The Democratic nominee, La Crosse County supervisor Jill Billings, defeated Republican nominee David A. Drewes.\nA special primary was held on October 11, 2011, in which Billings defeated three opponents.\n\n\n=== Judicial ===\n\n\n==== State Supreme Court ====\n\nA regularly scheduled Wisconsin Supreme Court election was held on April 5, 2011. The incumbent judge David Prosser Jr., first appointed by Governor Tommy Thompson in 1998, won his second ten-year term, defeating assistant attorney general Joanne Kloppenburg.  His victory preserved the 4–3 conservative majority on the court.\nOn election night, Kloppenburg appeared to have won a narrow victory, but during a recount, the Waukesha County clerk discovered 14,000 missing votes from the city of Brookfield, which broke heavily in favor of Prosser.\n\n\n==== State Court of Appeals ====\nTwo seats on the Wisconsin Court of Appeals were up for election on April 5, 2011.  \n\nIn District III, incumbent judge Gregory A. Peterson, first elected in 1999, won his third six-year term without opposition.\nIn District IV, incumbent judge Paul B. Higginbotham, appointed by Governor Jim Doyle in 2003, won his second six-year term without opposition.\n\n\n==== State Circuit Courts ====\nForty one of the state's 249 circuit court seats were up for election in 2011. Nine of those seats were contested, four incumbent judges faced a contested election and one was defeated.\n\n\n== Local offices ==\n\n\n=== Brown County ===\n\n\n==== Green Bay mayor ====\n\nA regularly scheduled mayoral election was held in Green Bay, Wisconsin, concurrent with the Spring general election, April 5, 2011.  Incumbent mayor Jim Schmitt, first elected in 2003, won his third four-year term, defeating county supervisor Patrick Evans.\n\n\n=== Dane County ===\n\n\n==== Madison mayor ====\n\nA regularly scheduled mayoral election was held in Madison, Wisconsin, concurrent with the Spring general election, April 5, 2011.

(Kenbishi Shuzo) is headquartered in Hyogo Prefecture, Kobe, Higashinada-ku, and is the brewery of the Japanese Sake \"Kenryo\" series It is a long-established brewery that has been in business for more than 500 years.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nHeadquartered in Mikagego, one of the Nada Five Villages, it is nicknamed \"Kenbishi\". In the literature of Edo Bakumatsu, it is recorded that the roots of Inaderaya were founded in Itami (now Itami City, Hyogo Prefecture) in the 2nd year of Eisho (1505). Inaderaya's sake was also highly regarded in Edo, but it is unknown when it came to be called \"。 In Showa 4 (1929), it moved to its current location in Kobe CityHigashinada Ward, and continues to the present. For a while, the reputation was greatly damaged by OEM (oke buying), which buys sake from other companies and sells it under its own brand, but it has regained its reputation by manufacturing and selling it in-house again.\nThe traditional method of brewing, which begins in late autumn and is laid down from early spring to autumn, continues to this day. Combined with Yoshino cedar made of Yoshino cedar, it is characterized by its rich taste and sharp mouthfeel.\nIn addition to pots, Kenryo Sake Brewery still uses a lot of wooden products that have been used since ancient times in the manufacture and sale of Japan sake, such as warm air barrels and 菰barrels。 In the Japan sake industry as a whole, these wooden products have been replaced by metal and resin products and glass bottles, making it difficult to obtain. For this reason, Kenryo Sake Brewery has established a new factory dedicated to the maintenance and production of wooden sake utensils and straw rope on the land adjacent to the Hamakura Plant. We also undertake orders from other Japan sake and soy sauce companies.\n\n\n== Trademark Origin ==\nIt is said that there are two theories about the origin of the trademark of \"。\n\nThe theory that it is a symbol of the unity of heaven and earth, yin and yang. The upper part is a symbol of a man, and the lower part is a symbol of a woman.\nWhen the well for brewing water was changed (cleaned), a statue of Fudo Myo appeared from the bottom of the well, so it is said that the brewer at the time, Sakagami Kirin, imitated the shape of the blade and bridle of the sword of the demon (倶利伽羅剣) held in the right hand of Fudo Myō and made it into a sake mark.\nFor these reasons, it is said that as a benefit of drinking Kenryo, one feels fresh spirit, and with the spirit of the sake mark (trademark) and the spirit of sake, it revives the weakened momentum and inspires the family fortune to prosper.\nAccording to the linguist Akira Kaminaga, the Japan 。\n\n\n== Products ==\nHonjozo sake\n\n(Selected) Kenbishi\nKuromatsu Kenbishi\nTop quality Kuromatsu Kenbishi\nPure rice sake\n\nZuisho Kuromatsu Kenbishi (old sake blend, winter limited product) \nMizuho Kuromatsu Kenbishi\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKenbishi Sake Brewery Co., Ltd.\n\"Yamada Nishiki Club\" to learn about the hometown of the best sake rice \"Yamada Nishiki\" and sake culture Nada Brewery Tour Part 1 “Kenbishi Sake Brewery Co., Ltd.”\n\n\n== Related article ==\nTwelve Villages of Setsen\nItami Sake\nNada Gogo\nDownhill Liquor\nGozen sake\nItami City Library - Built on the site of Kenbishi in Itami City Miyanomae.

        "content": "Baghdad Television (Arabic: تلفزيون بغداد, romanized: tilfizyun baghdad, lit. 'Baghdad Television Station') (BTV) or known as Iraqi TV (Arabic: التلفزيون العراقي, romanized: altilfizyun aleiraqiu, lit. 'Iraqi Television') was as first television in Iraq, which was operation from 2 May 1956 until 13 April 2003 after fall of Baghdad\nsince 2003, BTV was off-air which station was replaced by Al-Iraqiya\n\n\n== History ==\nTelevision first arrived in Iraq on 2 May 1956, at first only in the Baghdad area with a station named Baghdad Television (BTV) on channel 8, switching to channel 9 in November 1959 after an increasing of its power. On 18 November 1967 the second TV station opened in Kirkuk, on 2 March 1968 a new transmitter had been opened in Mosul and on 6 November 1968 in Basrah. On 30 July 1972 Baghdad Television opened its second TV station on channel 7, and in 1974 two new stations opened in Amarah (capital city of the Maysan Governorate) and Samawah (capital city of the Muthanna Governorate), the latter one opening in March. In July 1976 colour television was introduced using the French SECAM system. By 1976 the entire country could receive broadcasts from the central station in Baghdad after the installation of a microwave relay system.\nBaghdad Television was the primary TV station in Iraq while Saddam Hussein was in power. Until the 2003 invasion of Iraq, much of its programming was patriotic music videos, government news and propaganda. It ceased broadcasting during the 2003 invasion when the transmitter network became inoperable due to bombing raids.\nA second TV channel was established on 30 July 1972 broadcasting on channel 7 in the Baghdad area. The channel was renamed Youth Channel (Qanaat Al-Shabaab) on 17 July 1993 and broadcast subtitled Western movies and music videos before the 2003 invasion. Foreign programmes were censored to remove strong language, sex and violence so programming would be suitable for all ages. Other channels available included Baghdad Cultural TV, Al-Shabaab 2 and Iraq Satellite Channel.\nBecause BTV was free to air, it also received a substantial amount of attention from viewers outside Iraq, particularly during the 2003 invasion of the country.\n\n\n== Downfall and current day ==\nMany TV stations have appeared since the fall of Saddam. Under the direction of Ambassador L. Paul Bremer III as the Administrator, the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) began issuing radio and television licenses in June 2003 to meet the great demand for broadcasting licenses.  The licenses were issued by the CPA Senior Adviser for Telecommunications. To plan for the expected great demand, this CPA office worked with Iraqi radio-frequency spectrum engineers and managers to develop a national FM-radio and TV channel allotment plan for all of the major Iraqi cities and towns. The national plan was developed using technical criteria and the Region 1 (Europe, Africa and the Middle East) allotment plan that was developed years before by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a United Nations treaty organization. The Iraqi allotment plan consisted of hundreds of FM radio and TV stations allotted to the cities and towns. The channels in the allotment plan were then open to anyone to apply for a license for a particular channel.\nThe CPA developed a few basic rules and regulations in June and July 2003 to provide a limited regulatory control of the broadcasters.  For example, broadcasts inciting riots were prohibited. The overall CPA objective was to issue many licenses to provide for a plethora of diverse voices, information, music, and news to satisfy the desires and tastes of the Iraqi citizens. The CPA also recognized that broadcasting was a combination of business, advertising, journalism, engineering, and entertainment, and a robust and thriving broadcasting industry could provide a large number of excellent and highly desirable professional jobs that would reduce national unemployment. The CPA also recognized that commercial broadcasting could provide wealth-building opportunities to successful broadcasters.\nThe Iraqi Media Network (IMN), a public broadcasting network similar to the Public Broadcasting System in the United States, was issued radio and TV licenses by the CPA.\nThe CPA continued its work as the national broadcasting licensing and regulatory authority until June 2004 when the Iraq Communications and Media Commission (CMC) was established as the national regulatory agency that would issue licenses and regulate broadcasting and telecommunications.\nIn August 2014, LANA TV a new general entertainment channel started broadcasting regional series dubbed in Iraqi dialect. This is the first time that a TV Channel is broadcasting high quality Iraqi dubbing. LANA TV has hired Iraq's top theatre actors and actress such as Ustad Sami Qeftan to train the dubbing artists.\nThe overall result is that there are hundreds of radio and television stations operating in Iraq.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTelevision in Iraq\nAl-Iraqiya\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The American Female Guardian Society (full name, American Female Guardian Society and Home for the Friendless) was an American prototype civic improvement association and a pioneer child-saving institution. Incorporated in 1849, and based in New York City, it was an outgrowth of the New York Female Moral Reform Society. The Society existed until at least 1941 when its official organ, Advocate and family guardian ceased operation.The aims of the Society were to rescue homeless children, and to secure for them permanent country homes in Christian families. Many thousands of homeless children were thus been provided for. It provided shelter for indigent women and served as an employment agency on their behalf. It provided education to women and children living in slums.The Society had no endowment, but was mainly sustained by charitable contributions, and donations of clothing and provisions. Its work was limited only by the amount of donations received. It sustained twelve Industrial Schools, in destitute sections of the city, in which between 5,000 and 6,000 children of the poorest class were gathered. Besides the primary branches of an English education, the girls were taught sewing, cooking, housekeeping, and the boys carpentry. The Society had an Employment Aid Department, where work was provided for many aged women, who were otherwise kindly cared for.\nThe children's summer home at Oceanport, New Jersey known as John D. Wright Memorial Home, was the summer retreat of the juvenile inmates of the Home. The Advocate and family guardian, the official organ of the Society, was a semi-monthly journal, published by the executive committee, at 29 East 29th Street.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Thomas Henry Figures (August 6, 1944 – January 22, 2015) was an American attorney and judge. He was the first African American assistant district attorney and assistant United States Attorney from Mobile, Alabama. Figures earned convictions on two members of the Ku Klux Klan for the lynching of Michael Donald and testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee against the judicial nomination of Jeff Sessions.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nFigures grew up in Mobile, Alabama, and graduated from Central High School in 1962. He attended Alabama State College and transferred to Alabama State University (ASU) and served as president of the Student Government Association. He graduated second in his class in 1966. Figures enrolled in the Master of Business Administration program at Indiana University Bloomington and earned a Juris Doctor from University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter he graduated, he worked as legal counsel for Mobil Oil in New York and became an assistant district attorney in Westchester County, New York. He then returned to Mobile and became the first African American assistant district attorney in Mobile County.\nIn 1978, Figures became an assistant United States Attorney. In that role, he prosecuted two members of the Ku Klux Klan for the lynching of Michael Donald. The FBI was about to close the investigation when Figures insisted that they reopen it, finding evidence that led them to the two suspects, who were arrested in 1983 and convicted of murder. Michael Figures, Thomas' brother, and Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center represented Donald's mother, Beulah Mae Donald, in a civil suit for wrongful death against the United Klans of America (UKA). They won a $7 million judgment ($18,773,286 in current dollar terms) against the UKA in 1987, bankrupting the organization.\nFigures resigned in 1985 in protest of United States Attorney Jeff Sessions' prosecution of community activists in Perry County, including Albert Turner, for voter fraud. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan nominated Sessions to the federal judiciary. Figures came forward with allegations of Sessions' behavior, such as referring to Figures as \"boy\" and the NAACP as \"un-American\", which Sessions said were \"absolutely untrue\". Figures also said that Sessions had said that he believed the Ku Klux Klan \"was OK until I found out they smoked pot,” which Sessions claimed was a joke. Figures testified about his experience working with Sessions in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which rejected the nomination.\nIn 1992, Figures was indicted on one count of bribery for allegedly offering $50,000 and other assistance to a witness in a drug case not to testifythat he was working as a defense attorney. Figures alleged that he had been indicted as revenge for his testimony against Sessions; Sessions denied the alleggation and transferred the prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. Figures pleaded not guilty and was acquitted at trial.\nGovernor Fob James removed two members of the ASU's board of trustees and appointed Figures to one of the positions on September 30, 1998. However, the removed members were restored to the board by a court ruling and he was removed in November. He appealed the decision to the Alabama Supreme Court and the ruling against him was affirmed. Governor Don Siegelman appointed Figures to the board of trustees in 2002. His term ended in 2014.\nIn 2007, Sam Jones, the mayor of Mobile, appointed Figures to serve as a municipal judge.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nFigures and his wife, Janice, married in 1987. She filed for divorce in 1991. Figures died on January 22, 2015, at the age of 70.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Waipā Networks Limited is a New Zealand electricity distribution company, serving Cambridge, Te Awamutu and areas extending to Kawhia, Hauturu, Pukeatua, French Pass and Paterangi. Waipā has about 30,000 connections and is 100% owned by the Waipā Energy Trust.\n\n\n== History ==\nWaipā Networks was formed in 1998 from Waipā Power, which began in 1993 with the merger of Te Awamutu and Cambridge Electric Power Boards.The Boards were set up under the Electric-power Boards Act 1918, after the Public Works Department bought the 6,300 kW (8,400 hp) Horahora power station on 1 November 1919 for £212,500. Hamilton Chamber of Commerce held a conference to create a Hydro Electric Power Board for the Waikato, on 23 June 1919, but that was rejected and it was agreed to form local boards instead.\n\n\n=== Cambridge Electric Power Board ===\nCambridge Power Board initially covered about 100 sq mi (260 km2), with 200 hp (150 kW) allocated to the Board.A provisional committee to form a Board held its first meeting on 1 October 1919. The first Board was elected on 11 February 1920. The first power in the Waikato from Horahora was switched on at Leamington town hall on 28 April 1921, but it took another year to turn on the street lights in Cambridge, as all the other local Boards had taken on staff and put in orders earlier. A 2-storey office opened on Alpha Street in October 1925. The building was renovated in 1992.\n\n\n=== Te Awamutu Electric Power Board ===\nTe Awamutu Power Board was the first in the country to be set up, its first meeting being on 10 February 1920. It initially covered about 300 sq mi (780 km2), including Kihikihi, Te Awamutu, Pirongia, Te Rore, and Ōhaupō, with 600 hp (450 kW) allocated to the Board.No election was held for the first Board, as a campaign had been run to have only one candidate for each area represented and the consensus allowed a 1920 poll, for a £120,000 loan, to be carried without opposition. In Te Awamutu 81 street lights were lit up on 26 August 1921. Kihikihi received power on 6 September, Pirongia on 30 December and Ōhaupō on 15 February 1922. The Board met in several locations, until their concrete office block at 486-488 Alexandra Street was completed in December 1926.\n\n\n== Network ==\nThe Waipa Networks distribution network consists of approximately 2,300 km of lines, supplying approximately 28,000 customers. Electricity is supplied from the national grid via grid exit points (GXPs) at Transpower's Cambridge and Te Awamutu substation. Waipa Networks owns a 36 km (22 mi), 110,000-volt transmission line linking Transpower's Te Awamutu and Hangatiki substations, which is operated by Transpower as part of the national grid. The line was commissioned in 2016 to provide a second supply for Te Awamutu, which previously experienced day-long outages every two years while maintenance was carried out on the transmission line from Karapiro.As of 2024, Waipa Networks doesn't have a subtransmission network; the two GXPs directly feed the 11,000-volt distribution network. 3,672 distribution transformers step the 11,000 volts down to 230/400 volts (phase-to-neutral/phase-to-phase) to supply consumers.Due to high growth in the Cambridge area and constrained supply at the Cambridge GXP, Transpower and Waipa Networks are building a 220/33 kV substation and grid exit point at Hautapu. The substation will be located next to the Waikato Expressway where Transpower's existing 220,000-volt lines cross it. The grid exit point will initially feed a single co-sited 33/11 kV zone substation, which will supply the distribution network in the rural area west of Cambridge areas and taking load off Cambridge GXP. In future, a 33 kV subtransmission network will expand from Hautapu GXP to feed additional 33/11 kV zone substations around Cambridge. The substations are expected to be completed in December 2024.Waipā Networks statistics as at 31 March 2022 -\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWaipā Networks website\nWaipā Energy Trust website\nPhotos of Te Awamutu Electric Power Board HQ in 1990 and in 2019",

        "content": "The Akbastau (Kazakh: Ақбастау; Russian: Ақбастау) is a river in Karkaraly District, Karaganda Region, Kazakhstan. It is 83 kilometres (52 mi) long and has a catchment area of 1,570 square kilometres (610 sq mi).\n\n\n== Course ==\nThe Akbastau has its sources in a spring of the northern slopes of Zhaksy Karazhal mountains, at the northern end of Shet District. It heads northwards as a mountain river, forming rapids within a narrow valley. Towards the end it enters a floodplain and its channel divides into branches and becomes sinuous, flowing roughly northwards all along. Finally it reaches the left bank of river Nura close to the western slopes of Mount Yegizkyzyl.\nThe Akbastau is fed by snow and groundwater. It is frozen between early December and mid-April. Its main tributaries are the Ainasu and Kamystybulak from the left, and the Kaskakudyk from the right. The water of the river stays fresh all year round. \n\n\n== Ecology ==\nThe river basin is used as pasture for local cattle. Grasses, willow thickets, fescue and sedges grow near the banks.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of rivers of Kazakhstan\n\n\n== References ==",

After graduating from the Pingtung Normal College, he became an elementary schoolteacher, and subsequently completed a master's in education from National Kaohsiung Normal University in 1985, followed by a doctorate in education at National Chengchi University in 1992.\n\n\n== Academic career ==\nCheng began his career at National Sun Yat-sen University in 1985, first as a professor and successively serving as the dean of students and social sciences before assuming the university presidency. During his presidential tenure, Cheng in 2019 proposed that NSYSU merge with Kaohsiung Medical University. The following year, Cheng commented on, then penned an open letter about, the university's handling of plagiarism allegations against alumnae Li Mei-jhen. In 2022, NSYSU became the first university in Taiwan to offer mental health leave to its students, and inaugurated the College of Semiconductor and Advanced Technology Research.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nIn the mid-2000s, Cheng headed the Kaohsiung City Government's Bureau of Education. He later served two terms as leader of the Democratic Progressive Party-affiliated New Frontier Foundation.\nCheng was named Minister of Education in Cho Jung-tai's incoming cabinet on 12 April 2024. At the time of his appointment to the Executive Yuan, Cheng held no party affiliation.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The paper mill of Richard-de-Bas in Ambert in the natural region of Livradois, in the department of Puy-de-Dôme, in the center of Massif central, is one of the oldest French companies. It is labeled Living heritage company.\n\n\n== History ==\nThis mill is believed to date back to 1326. It takes its name from a family of papermakers in the 15th century: the Richard and Bas being the geographical distinction between the six buildings around the reach. From 1400 to 1850 the skins of animals were tanned and since then rags have been used to make paper pulp.\nThis valley of the Dore is known in particular for its numerous paper mills; up to 400 mills produced paper from rags between Thiers and Ambert. True to this tradition, the Moulin Richard de Bas produces high-quality paper that is used for the restoration of writings, watercolours, lithographs, etc.\nThe facades and roofs of all the buildings, the machinery rooms on the ground floor, the rooms on the living floor in the main building, the barn and the drying shed are classified as historic monuments by order of 30 December 1983.\nIt was in 1940 that Marius Péraudeau (CE 1906–1992), bought from the newspaper, Le Moniteur du Puy-de-Dôme (1856–1944), this mill then abandoned after the death of Claude Chantelauze, its owner who occupied the premises. Marius Péraudeau, who was 36 years old at the time and working as an industrial paper sales representative, decided to come to the rescue of a profession that was already on the verge of disappearing. On October 14, 1940, the Marshal Pétain, head of the French State, comes at the invitation of Henri Pourrat to meet the working people in Ambert, near Vichy, on a visit to the paper mill, and ordered a ream of paper watermarked with his emblem.\nHe therefore founded an association: \"La Feuille Blanche\", which created a summer camp for apprentices in the graphic arts professions (papermakers, photoengravers, printers, bookbinders) and which made it possible to hide some resistance fighters wanted by the Gestapo. In 1943, he founded the Historical Paper Museum, of which he became curator. In 1945, he organised a tour of his factory. He collaborated with the greatest artists of his time to create works of art such as: Bernard Buffet, Salvador Dali, Jacques Prévert, Joseph Foret (1901–1991), art publisher, Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes, Léonor Fini, Léonard Foujita, Pierre-Yves Trémois, Georges Mathieu, Ossip Zadkine, and writers such as: Emil Cioran, Jean Cocteau, Jean Giono, Jean Guitton, Ernst Jünger, Daniel-Rops, Edmond Rostand, and others Michel Ciry, Albert Decaris, Ernst Fuchs, Roger Lersy.\nAfter experiencing some difficulties, the business started again in CE 1997 under the direction of Emmanuel Kerbourc'h, grandson of the founder who is now thinking of passing on the legacy to the next generation.\n\n\n== Appendices ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAntiques Brocante, September CR 2022, n° 287, p. 72-73\nThe Long History of a Small French Stationery Factory, by Marius Péraudeau, Paris, P.

        "content": "The Centre Agreement – Integrative Initiative (Polish: Porozumienie Centrum – Inicjatywa Integracyjna, PC–II) was a Christian-democratic political party in Poland. It was founded by the former secretary and member of the executive board of Centre Agreement (PC) Wojciech Dobrzyński, who was stripped of his functions on 5 October 1994, and then expelled from the party by Jarosław Kaczyński in January 1995. Kaczyński expelled Dobrzyński over his willigness to cooperate with the right-wing Christian National Union, a party that wanted to create an All-Polish electoral alliance that would unite all right-leaning parties in Poland but exclude the PC.\nIn response, Dobrzyński founded the PC–II in January 1995, and pursued the creation of a big tent post-Solidarity bloc on his own. The party supported Lech Wałęsa in the 1995 Polish presidential election and entered the president's inner circle. In July 1995, Centre Agreement – Integrative Initiative participated in talks organized by Wałęsa's party, Nonpartisan Bloc for Support of Reforms, to create a coalition called National Concord Block (Polish: Blok Zgody Narodowej). Ultimately, talks failed when Wałęsa failed to win his second presidential term. In 1996, Centre Agreement – Integrative Initiative became one of the founding parties of the Solidarity Electoral Action and ran on its lists in the 1997 Polish parliamentary election. In February 1998, the party merged with the Conservative People's Party together with the Republicans (Polish: Partia Republikanie) of Zbigniew Religa.\n\n\n== History ==\nStarting in 1992, the Centre Agreement (PC) led by Jarosław Kaczyński, that sought to become the dominating Christian-democratic party in Poland, was rocked by splits as well as the conflict with president Lech Wałęsa. Internal fighting within the party escalated following the downfall of the government of Jan Olszewski, which led a group of Olszewski supporters (known as the \"Christian Democrats\" faction in the party) decided to leave the Agreement and form a new formation. Initially it was known as the Christian Democratic Forum, which on 30 December 1992 adopted a new name, hitherto only carried by its parliamentary representation: the Movement for the Republic (RdR).\nThe RdR parliamentary club included a group of 13 MPs from the PC, two from the Confederation of Independent Poland, one from the Silesian Autonomy Movement, along with 4 senators. In November 1992, Romuald Szeremietiew's small Polish Independence Party (Polish: Polska Partia Niepodległościowa), which had existed since the mid-1980s, joined Olszewski's formation. Two ministers from Olszewski's government also formed their own groups. Antoni Macierewicz, removed from the Christian National Union (ZChN) on 19 July 1992, formed the Christian-National Movement 'Polish Action' (Polish: Ruch Chrześcijańsko-Narodowy „Akcja Polska\") (AP), which included two more RdR deputies supporting him (Piotr Walerych and Mariusz Marasek), as well as at least several dozen members of the party. The first AP congress was held on 27 February 1993, and already in June the grouping joined the RdR. Jan Parys, on the other hand, kept his independence by establishing - on the basis of committees created in his defence during the conflict with Wałęsa - the Third Republic Movement (RTR), registered as a party on 7 August 1992.\nIn September 1992, Olszewski and Parys formed the Coalition for the Republic, which was to form the nucleus of a future electoral alliance, but this did not end the disagreements between the former Prime Minister and Minister of Defence. The RdR, AP and RTR operated with very radical slogans, prominent among which were demands for lustration and decommunisation. The main object of their attacks, however, was not so much the post-communists as the President and the Democratic Union, considered the greatest threat. Harsh criticism of liberal circles was also the focus of the attention of \"Gazeta Polska\", a monthly and then weekly magazine sympathising with the RDC, edited by Piotr Wierzbicki.\nJarosław Kaczyński, after resigning from the Suchocka government, was now in conflict with all the leaders of the centre-right. Kaczyński continued his war with Wałęsa, and in October 1992, he decided to remove from the club a group of five MPs advocating the PC's entry into the government coalition. As a result, these MPs moved to the Polski Program Liberalny club, and Kaczyński's influence in the Sejm shrank. Kaczyński then entered a temporary agreement with RdR, as despite their split, both the PC and RdR were united with hostility towards Wałęsa. On 22 January 1993, a rally was held - under the slogan \"Poland - time for change!\" - a rally of at least 5,000 supporters of the PC, RTR, RdR and Freedom Party. During the march, Wałęsa was accused of collaborating with the Communist secret service in the 1980s. His effigy bearing the inscription 'Bolek' was burnt in front of the president's residence, and on 1 February, at a press conference, Jarosław Kaczyński explicitly demanded that Wałęsa resign, and proceeded to set up a special Committee for the Recall of the President.\nKaczyński's conflict with the president sparked what Polish historian Antoni Dudek termed McCarthyism, as Kaczyński would now unveil scandals and accuse his political opponents of collaboration with the fallen communist authorities. In June, Kaczyński accused Mieczysław Wachowski of taking part in an SB officers' course in 1975; the main proof of which was supposed to be a photograph - later shown on TV - of a group of its participants, with a person resembling Wachowski. However, the commander of the Lublin police, Arnold Superczyński, claimed to be the person in the photo. However, this failed to harm Wachowski's reputation.\nIn 1992, Wojciech Dobrzyński, the secretary and a member of the Centre Agremeent's leadership, was accused of accepting a bribe from the company \"Horn\", in exchange for arranging its fuel import concession. On 26 February 1993, Dobrzyński was arrested, and this affair was heavily publicized by the media, having a negative impact on PC's image. However, in March 1993 Kaczyński disclosured a secret Office of State Protection (UOP) instruction of 26 October 1992 issued by the head of the Office, Jerzy Konieczny. It concerned the recruitment of 'personal sources of information' (i.e. agents), euphemistically called 'experts' and 'consultants', and its contents indicated the desire of the secret service to spread control over Polish political life. When the Sejm's Administration and Internal Affairs Committee referred the controversial Instruction 0015/92 to the Constitutional Tribunal with a request to examine its legality, the UOP leadership decided in May 1993 to repeal it. Dobrzyński was later released from custody, although the whole affair created a rift between him and Kaczyński.\nBefore the 1993 parliamentary elections, the PC negotiated the formation of an electoral coalition with various groupings, above all with the Third Republic Movement, the RdR and the Peasants' Agreement, but in the end, the party decided to run independently. In the 1993 Polish parliamentary election, the Centre Agreement failed to cross the electoral threshold and lost all its seats, which would prove damaging to the party as further splits emerged. Dobrzyński believed that the reason for party's failure was its refusal to work together with other parties, and initiated talks with other formations in order to secure a long-lasting agreement for future parliamentary elections. This move was opposed by the rest of the PC leadership, and on 5 October 1994, Dobrzyński was removed from his functions, and was expelled from the executive board of the party.\nDobrzyński continued his efforts to negotiate a coalition with the Centre Agreement, and he appeared in press conferences for the right-wing Christian National Union (ZChN). Kaczyński then expelled Dobrzyński from the party altogether in January 1995, arguing that while ZChN was planning to unify Polish anti-communist parties, it sought to explicitly exclude and isolate Centre Agreement. Shortly after his expulsion, Dobrzyński founded his own party, Centre Agreement – Integrative Initiative, where he wanted to unite fellow 'unity-minded' members of the PC.\nSoon after, Dobrzyński and his party established friendly relations with the President Lech Wałęsa, in stark contrast to Centre Agreement, which remained in conflict with the President. In June 1995, the party became associated with the \"official\" grouping of Wałęsa, the Nonpartisan Bloc for Support of Reforms (BBWR). In June 1995, the PC–II led a meeting together with BBWR that sought to create a new centre-right Polish electoral alliance – the National Concord Block (Polish: Blok Zgody Narodowej). The meeting was also attended by the Confederation of Independent Poland, Party of Christian Democrats, Peasants' Agreement, RdR, the National-Democratic Party and the Party of Polish Democracy. Centre Agreement – Integrative Initiative also backed Lech Wałęsa in the 1995 Polish presidential election, who narrowly lost to social-democratic, former communist Aleksander Kwaśniewski.\nIn 1996, the party became one of the founding members of the Solidarity Electoral Action, which became a broad alliance of post-Solidarity parties, as Dobrzyński envisioned. Centre Agreement itself also joined the Solidarity Electoral Action, and both PC–II and PC fielded candidates on its electoral list. Despite being the leader of the PC, Jarosław Kaczyński himself refused to join Solidarity Electoral Action, and instead run in the 1997 Polish parliamentary election on the list of Movement for Reconstruction of Poland. Having entered the Sejm with a single seat, the Centre Agreement – Integrative Initiative participated in the party congress of the Conservative People's Party in late February 1998. The Conservative People's Party planned to create a grand conservative formation which would unite numerous minor movements. However, ultimately only two parties decided to join the party - the Centre Agreement – Integrative Initiative and a short-lived party called the Republicans (Polish: Partia Republikanie), led by Zbigniew Religa.\nShortly before the Centre Agreement – Integrative Initiative joined the Conservative People's Party, Jarosław Kaczyński left the Centre Agreement in January 1998, at the 4th Congress; Antoni Tokarczuk became the new chairman of the party. In the same month, Centre Agremeent was removed from the register of parties of the Civil Registration Court. Later, in September 1999, another initiative to unite Polish Christian Democrats - Polish Christian Democratic Agreement (PPChD) - came to fruition. However, the formation of the PPChD did not lead to the dissolution of the Centre Agreement, but only to a split. Some activists from Warsaw did not accept the unification. President Tokarczuk moved to the new party, Jarosław Kaczyński and Ludwik Dorn returned to the old party. The party also returned to the name Porozumienie Centrum. On 8 June 2001, the party was registered as Law and Justice.\n\n\n== Electoral results ==\n\n\n=== Presidential ===\n\n\n=== Sejm ===\n\n\n=== Senate ===\n\n\n== Ideology ==\nThe Centre Agreement – Integrative Initiative was a centre-right party, slightly to the right of its original grouping, the Centre Agreement. It followed the tradition of Polish Christian democracy, which was the main ideology of the party. It also described itself as a Roman Catholic grouping.\nThe party was wary of free market and opposed to commercialisation and privatisation of state-owned enterprises, and lobbied president Wałęsa to veto such bills in 1995. It also described itself as a nationalist party, and proposed the idea of a \"patriotic front\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Real Club Marítimo del Abra y Real Sporting Club is a yacht club located in Getxo, Biscay, Spain. It is one of the most important clubs in Spain, along with the rest of the members of the Spanish Association of Nautical Clubs (AECN), to which it belongs.\nThe club is the result of the union carried out in 1972 between the Real Sporting Club, founded in Bilbao in 1898, and Real Club Marítimo del Abra, founded in 1902. The former was one of the founders of Royal Spanish Sailing Federation and was involved in the drawing up of the first Racing Regulations in Spain.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe merchants or fishermen of Biscay had to risk their lives in the Cantabrian Sea for centuries. During the industrial revolution, navigation developed into a recreational sport and became a leisure activity. In the 1880s, amateurs were already renting a house in Zorroza, where they exercised in yawls and perissoir (small canoes), and this original group of rowing and sailing fans was the one who founded the Sporting Club of Bilbao a few years later.\n\n\n== Origins ==\n\n\n=== Real Sporting Club ===\nThe Real Sporting Club de Bilbao was founded in 1898 in the neighborhood of Zorroza, next to the Bilbao estuary and at the end of the capital of Vizcaya since the annexation of Abando, in a house jointly owned by the Ybarra-Revilla brothers and the Briñas family. It was founded as a mix of a sports club and a social club exclusively for men (women could only enter at the annual gala dinner). Its first documented board was chaired by Enrique Careaga, with vice president José de Zayas and members Eduardo Ubao, José Amann, Jaime Selby, and Ramón Real de Asúa, with Manuel Elorduy as secretary. The club had its headquarters in a punt, built in the Nervión Shipyards, 25 meters long by 10 meters wide and approximately 1 meter deep, to which 9 more meters in length were added in 1909, which was located in Portugalete, in the Abra, every summer, while in the winter, the club stayed at Axpe (Erandio). In the winter of 1981, this historic headquarters went under.\nIn 1900, Sporting and other clubs formed the Federation of Cantabrian Clubs, the seed of the current Royal Spanish Sailing Federation, which promoted a Copa del Cantábrico, whose Regattas were regulated in that same year and were run for the first time in 1901. Also in 1901, the club obtained the title of \"Real\" from Alfonso XIII, who thus became the club's honorary president. Sporting soon organized regattas of yachts and sloops, including the oldest regatta in the country, the Copa Gitana, bringing its members to the nautical competitions of San Sebastián, Santander, Bayonne, and Kiel. They went to the latter at the suggestion of Alfonso XIII, when he was named honorary president of the club, once his new floating house was installed next to the iron dock of Portugalete. The King's annual attendance at the week of regattas organized by Sporting came to turn Bilbao into a Cowes or Kiel, whose regattas were so lovingly attended by Edward VII of England and William II of Germany.\nIn 1905, Alfonso XIII granted them the privilege of having their own uniform, el pico, a copy of the Navy's dress uniform, transformed with gold buttons from the Spanish Navy. In that same year, the club organized the first Copa del Rey de vela in honor of Alfonso XIII, a competition that since 1982 has been organized by the Real Club Náutico de Palma. In the summer of 1908, Alfonso XIII, arrived in Bilbao on board the Giralda on 15 August, and he was met by the flotilla of sloops of Sporting, which was then chaired by José Antonio de Arana, and the steamer Elcano with the representatives of the Cortes, Tomas Zubiría Ybarra, Juan Tomás Gandarias, and the local authorities. During his stay in Biscay, the King participated in the sloop regattas, also celebrating the cruise to Castro Urdiales, which was won by the German Wertheim with the sloop Ilse II, while the regatta of Copa del Cantábrico was won by Sogalinda, owned by the Conde de Zubiría. In 1934 it was decided to change Sporting's summer mooring point from Portugalete to Las Arenas.\nIn addition to being a recreational club, essentially focused on nautical activities, it was a center directly linked to Biscayan conservatism. In the ranks of Sporting were not only conservative deputies, senators, and councillors, such as Federico Echevarría, Benigno Chávarri, and José Maria Martínez de las Rivas, but also counts or marquises, many of them titled by Alfonso XIII, such as Eduardo Aznar. Other honorary members of the club in 1902 included Gandarias, Evaristo Churruca, and Ramon de la Sota. Some of the club's actual members in 1902 were two future Mayor of Bilbao Federico Moyúa (no. 1) and Gregorio Balparda (no. 6), the Arteche brothers (Julio and Antonio) (no. 25/6), and the son of José Maria, Santiago Martínez de las Rivas (no. 3). Santiago and Sota are also among the founding members of Marítimo del Abra.\n\n\n=== Real Club Marítimo del Abra ===\nThe Real Club Marítimo del Abra was founded in 1902 by a group of young sportsmen from the city's high society. In 1910, Marítimo del Abra held a regatta jointly with Sporting, initialing this cooperation in 1921 with the creation of the Abra Cup.\nInterestingly, at the beginning of the 20th century, several founding members of both Bilbao FC and Athletic Club, the first two football clubs in the city, appear in the membership lists of the Real Sporting Club and the Club Marítimo del Abra. In the 1902 list of Sporting Club, for instance, there are the Arana brothers (Luis, José Antonio, and Darío), the Castellanos brothers (Manuel and Carlos) (no. 84/5), Ricardo Ugalde (no. 12), Perico Larrañaga (no. 33), José María Amann (no. 58), the future Athletic presidents Juan Astorquia (no. 120) and Enrique Careaga (no. 21) and his brother Eduardo (no. 28), and even Enrique Allende (no. 19), who went on to became the first president of Atlético Madrid, which at the time was a branch of Athletic Bilbao. Among the founding members of Marítimo del Abra were Amado Arana (no. 116), Rogelio Renovales (no. 72), José María Alday (no. 21), Walter Evans (no. 202), former Athletic president Luis Márquez (no. 62), and future Athletic presidents Ramón Jáuregui (no. 239), Pedro Astigárraga (no. 17), and Alejandro de la Sota (no. 75). Manuel Castellanos and Astorquia were also among the founding members of Marítimo del Abra. Notably, founding member no. 388 José Urízar Roales was the son of Luciano Urízar.\nAt the end of July 1902, the Marítimo had its first presentation ceremony, with the appointment of a board of directors made up of Ramón de la Sota (president), Ramón Hurtado (vice president), Ramón Coste (treasurer), Isidoro Larrínaga (accountant), José Luis de la Gándara (secretary), Horacio Echevarrieta, Joaquín de la Rica, Miguel Ferrer, Hermenegildo Lozano, and Pedro Olavarrieta (vocals). Marítimo had its headquarters in one of the first buildings built in Las Arenas, such as the establishment of Baños de Mar Bilbaínos. First, they rented and then bought part of the premises of the old spa where not only did nautical activities take place, but the families of the members, wives, and children, could access it as a space for \"recreation and entertainment typical of their class\". For this reason, for example, all political demonstrations were strictly prohibited, \"as well as all kinds of discussions about religion and politics\".\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1936, during the Spanish Civil War, Sporting was seized, first for a republican youth organization, and then as a submarine base. Just like Sporting, Marítimo was also seized during the civil war by the republican authorities, who took over its treasury and premises. The king and his visits were replaced by Francisco Franco, who visited the club during the Bilbao liberation festivities of 1939 and was named the new honorary president; however, the club's relations with Franco and his regime did not reach the familiarity of those maintained with Alfonso XIII. In 1941 Juan de Borbón was named honorary president, as his father had been. Sporting continued to maintain, without certainly showing any hostility to the Franco regime, a certain relationship with Bourbon monarchism. In fact, when Don Juan set foot on Spanish soil for the first time after his exile, landing from Giralda in Las Arenas in the summer of 1963, he headed to Sporting and then to Marítimo on 25 August 1963 and had lunch at the club the next day; Bourbon's journey, which should have continued in Gijón, did not have the opportunity to continue because he was not allowed to disembark.\nBetween 1939 and 1952, Sporting was called the Real Club de Regatas. In 1959, Sporting organized the first Spanish championship of the Dragon class.\n\n\n== Lay out ==\n\nOn 26 November 1973, its monumental and emblematic social building was completely destroyed by a terrorist action by ETA. The Club lost the building and its contents of paintings, trophies and memorabilia. Its current headquarters, which is located in the center of the Biscayan town of Las Arenas, next to the city center, was inaugurated in June 1976 and is the work of architects Eugenio Aguinaga and Iñigo Eulate when their project was chosen first prize in the competition held for this purpose. The building has two floors and a ground floor, with a total area of 5,000 m2, plus a bar, restaurant for 400 people, lounges, study Room and La Goleta nightclub. It also has a Padel court, sauna, gym, and heated indoor pool.\nThe Marina has 300 berths, for boats between 6 and 25 meters, equipped with water, electricity, and WiFi coverage. It has a travel lift, a fixed crane for small boats, a plank for stranded boats with a repair and cleaning service, a fuel supply, several nautical stores, and the Captain's Office building. In the Port area is located two seawater pools, which have a solarium, cafeteria-restaurant El Saltillo. Also within the port area are the Sailing School facilities.\nThe new headquarters has also suffered two more terrorist attacks by ETA, with the more recent one taking place in the early hours of 19 May 2008 when a bomb van with 60 kilos of explosives exploded next to the facilities of Marítimo del Abra as retaliation for Abra's selection as the club that would challenge for the Desafío Español in the next Copa del América. Until a month before, this representative club was the Real Club Náutico de Valencia, but when the Supreme Court of New York invalidated it as the first challenger, for being the closest thing to a ghost club (it had neither members nor moorings, nor registered office), the Desafío board decided to register for Náutico del Abra because Iberdrola, the tournament's main sponsor, had its headquarters in Bilbao, and also because it was the first, in alphabetical order, of the clubs that make up the Spanish association. According to the first analysis of the municipal architect, the club director Javier Chávarri stated that despite the great damage caused to the building, such as to the walls and furniture in the areas facing the sea on the ground floor and third floor, the structure of the club headquarters had not been damaged.\n\n\n== Athletes ==\nIn 1957, sailor Juan Manuel Alonso-Allende, from Real Sporting, won the Snipe class world championship for Spain for the first time, with Gabriel Laiseca as a crew member, aboard the Guadalimar. Pedro José de Galíndez, Luis Arana and his son Javier de Arana, Álvaro de Arana, and José María de Arteche participated in the Olympics in 1928 in the 6 Meter class. Zulema Calvo and Mariana Buesa won the L'Equipe class European championship in 2003 and Manolo Rey-Baltar Abascal and Borja Reig the Snipe youth European championship in 2021.\n\n\n== Presidents ==\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nCurrently, the Royal Maritime Club of Abra-Real Sporting Club continues to operate at its headquarters in Getxo, preserving old memories such as photographs signed by Alfonso XIII, the rudder wheels of the frigate Numancia (the one from the 1989 Callao bombing), the snipe with which Alonso Allende and Laiseca were world champions, dozens of caricatures of old partners.\n\n\n== References ==",

It has a faint sweetness of rice, and melts immediately when you put it in your mouth. The manufacturing method has been passed down through the generations, and is currently being made by Minoru Hoshi, the 23rd generation. The only ingredients are Uruchi rice (Sasanishiki), Cast sugar, Table salt (Hakata salt), and no Food additives are used.\n\n\n== Origin ==\nLong ago, a wealthy man named Kanbe, who lived near the approach to Matsushima Zuiganji Temple, befriended a merchant from Zuiganji during a pilgrimage to the Thirty-Three Kannons in Saigoku. When they are about to part ways, he regrets not leaving like this and wants to maintain a relationship with their relatives, so he arranges an engagement between Kotaro, the son of Kanbe, and Tani, the daughter of a merchant. However, when Kanbe returned from his pilgrimage, Kotaro had already died of illness. Tani, who did not know this, visited Kamobe dressed as a bride. When he learned that Kotaro had died, he remained in Matsushima and devoted himself to the Kanbe couple, saying, \"As long as our parents have forgiven us, we are husband and wife, and I want to serve Buddha until the end of my life.\" A few years later, when the Kanbe couple passed away one after another, her duty was to pray for the souls of their souls, and she changed her name to Guren and became a nun. Guren opened Shingetsu-an, baked rice crackers with the rice that had been offered, and gave them to the people of the village. This is called \"Matsushima Koren\", and it has been passed down to the present day.\n\n\n== Web-link ==\nGurenya Shingetsuan\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Swensson Farm Museum is a historic farmstead located in Chippewa County, Minnesota, six miles (10 km) east of Montevideo. Established by Norwegian immigrants Olof and Ingeborg Swensson in the 1880s, the farmstead today serves as open-air museum operated by the Chippewa County Historical Society showcasing pioneer life and Swedish-American heritage.\n\n\n== The Farmstead ==\nThe centerpiece of the museum is a grand 22-room brick farmhouse built around the turn of the 20th century. Swensson called it the \"Governor's Mansion on the Prairie.\" Inside, visitors can explore a self-guided tour that goes into the Swensson family life. The rooms feature original furnishings and personal belongings, showing domestic life on a late 19th-century farm.\nOne unique feature of the farmhouse is a 38x38 foot chapel located on the second floor. This reflected his deep religious faith. Swensson who held strong convictions that religious denominations were not adhering faithfully to their doctrines took on the role of a lay minister and delivered his own sermons in response. At first, his family and friends attended the chapel for worship services with Olof. However, over time, they gradually lost interest and stopped attending. This could have been due to the lengthy services and Olof's unique way of conducting them, known to historians as \"Olofisms.\" In the basement, the house contains designated areas were allocated for metalworking, woodworking, harness and blacksmithing, along with a room for agriculture and a fruit cellar.\nAnother significant structure on the farmstead is the large timber-framed barn, constructed in the 1880s. The barn has undergone extensive restoration and exemplifies the craftsmanship and resourcefulness of Swensson. The intricate wind-bracing and notching system testifies to his skills as a builder and designer.\nThe grounds also include the remains of a grist mill that Swensson constructed on his property, aiming to outcompete a rival in Granite Falls, Minnesota which happened to be the Pillsbury family, members of which founded the Pillsbury Company. It was first powered by horses and later by a steam engine.\nOlof and Ingeborg raised a family on the farm, with three children continuing to live and work the land after their parents' passing. The last surviving heir, John Swensson, bequeathed the farm to the Chippewa County Historical Society in 1967. Additionally, the family burial plot rests on the property.\n\n\n== Historical Significance ==\nThe Swensson Farm Museum is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  It holds significance for several reasons:\n\nPreserving Pioneer Life: It provides a tangible link to the past, offering visitors a chance to experience the challenges and triumphs of life on a Midwestern farm in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\nSwedish-American Heritage: The farmstead exemplifies the contributions of Swedish immigrants to the agricultural development of Minnesota.\nArchitectural Heritage: Both the grand farmhouse and the meticulously constructed barn showcase the architectural styles and building techniques of the era.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe farmstead gained recognition by being featured as a filming location for the Hollywood movie \"Sweet Land\" in 2004.\n\n\n== Chippewa County Historical Society ==\nThe Chippewa County Historical Society which owns and operates the property is a non-profit organization founded in 1936 in Montevideo, Minnesota. Its mission is to preserve and interpret the history of Chippewa County for future generations. The CCHS operates three distinct historical sites: Historic Chippewa City, the Swensson Farm Museum, and the Lac qui Parle Mission.\n\n\n=== Historic Chippewa City ===\nHistoric Chippewa City was established in 1965 as 20-acre open-air museum featuring a replica of a late 1800s village. It has 24 buildings, including a town square, boardwalk, bandstand, log cabins, an 1880s church, a general store, and various shops replicating those found in a pioneer village.\n\n\n=== Lac qui Parle Mission ===\n\nLac qui Parle Mission is managed by the Chippewa County Historical Society for the Minnesota Historical Society, Founded in 1835, it was home to the first church bell rung in the state, the first woven cloth produced by European settlers, and the first written Dakota language dictionary and Bible.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of museums in Minnesota",

        "content": "The Light Waterfront is a residential neighbourhood within the city of George Town in the Malaysian state of Penang. Situated within the city centre, it encompasses the foreshore north of the Penang Bridge and is bounded by the Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu Expressway to its west. Comprising a mix of residential, commercial and recreational developments, the township is being built through land reclamation by Malaysian conglomerate IJM Corporation.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1997, Jelutong Development Sdn Bhd (JDSB), a subsidiary of IJM Corporation, was awarded the Jelutong Expressway project – now known as the Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu Expressway. The highway aimed to reduce traffic congestion at Jelutong by providing a major connection between the city centre and the Penang Bridge.\nThe estimated cost of the expressway project was RM300 million. Due to insufficient funds, the Penang state government decided to compensate the developer with real estate developments that surrounded the expressway, in order to avoid the imposition of toll charges on local motorists. In exchange for the expressway, JDSB received exclusive rights to develop 368 acres (149 ha) of adjacent land – much of it to be reclaimed from the Penang Strait.\n\nThe 154-acre (62 ha) Light Waterfront encompassed the southernmost land parcel A1, which lies between the Green Lane interchange of the expressway and the Penang Bridge. It was unveiled in 2007 as a development masterplan that drew inspiration from the Sentosa Cove development in Singapore. The Light Waterfront masterplan was split into three phases. The first phase comprised residential developments within 42 acres (17 ha) of the southern part of the land reclamation. The second phase – known as 'The Light City' – covered around 103 acres (42 ha), and included hotels, office towers, an RM80 million art gallery, a retail complex called 'The Waterfront Shoppes' and the Penang Waterfront Convention Centre (PWCC). The PWCC is expected to be one of the largest convention centres in Penang, with a gross floor area of 270,000 sq ft (25,000 m2). A seafront park made up the third phase of the masterplan.\nThe first phase comprising residential components was complete as of 2021. Following a nationwide quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic, construction of The Light City only commenced in October 2020. The PWCC and The Waterfront Shoppes complex are expected to be completed by 2025.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBandar Sri Pinang\nSeri Tanjong Pinang\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "This article lists reactions to the prosecution of Donald Trump in New York on 34 felony charges of falsifying business records of a hush money payment relating to the Stormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal.\n\n\n== Before the indictment ==\nIn early 2023, while an indictment was widely anticipated, it remained publicly unknown when the Manhattan grand jury would finally decide whether to indict. On March 18, Trump wrote on Truth Social that he would be arrested on March 21 and called for protests to \"take our nation back!\" Time magazine reported that prominent supporters and far-right groups who responded to his call in the January 6 U.S. Capitol attack were reluctant. A demonstration was held by the New York Young Republican Club on March 20, though the presence of journalists vastly outnumbered it.\nOn March 22, a post was made on Trump's Truth Social account featuring two side-by-side images; one image showed Trump with a baseball bat, and the other image showed prosecutor Alvin Bragg. The post was eventually deleted, with Trump explaining in an interview that the post shared an article by the National File, a right-wing blog, that had those side-by-side images, which was why the images appeared in his Truth Social post.\nOn March 23, Trump wrote on Truth Social that \"potential death & destruction in such a false charge [of himself] could be catastrophic\" for America, and that only an America-hating \"degenerate psychopath\" would charge him. He also called District Attorney Bragg an \"animal\", which many have said has racist overtones.\n\n\n== During pretrial proceedings ==\n\n\n=== Public opinion ===\n\nFollowing the indictment, an ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted from March 31 to April 1, 2023, shows a plurality of Americans believed Trump should be charged, with 45% of voters believing Trump should be charged, 32% believing he should not, and 23% saying that they \"don't know\". The poll was split along party lines, with 88% of Democrats and 16% of Republicans believing Trump should be charged. A CNN poll conducted from March 31 to April 1 found that 60% of Americans approved of the indictment, but that 76% of Americans believed that it was politically motivated.\nABC News/Ipsos conducted a second poll from April 6 to April 7, 2023, showing a 5% increase to 50% among Americans who believe Trump should be charged, of which this view among Americans with no party preference rose to 54% from 40%. Meanwhile, 53% of Americans believe Trump intentionally did something illegal. The poll was again split along party lines, with 87% of Democrats, 57% of Independents, and 19% of Republicans in favor of the indictment.\n\n\n=== Republicans ===\n\n\n==== Donald Trump ====\nThe timing of the March 30 indictment reportedly surprised Trump and his team, who learned about it from the news. His attorneys had believed it was still weeks away and had expected the district attorney's office to inform them directly.\nTrump attributed his indictment to political persecution and election interference, among other things. He sent emails to his supporters asking for donations to \"defend our movement from the never-ending witch hunts\" and wrote that donations would have a \"1,500% impact\". The 2024 Trump campaign stated that it received over $4 million of donations in the 24 hours after the indictment was announced, and $7 million within three days.\nThe day after Trump was indicted, he criticized Juan Merchan, the New York Supreme Court judge set to oversee the case. He claimed that Merchan \"hates\" him and treated his companies \"viciously\" in a related case, and that he \"strong armed\" Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg into accepting a plea deal, though Weisselberg had reached the deal with prosecutors and his own lawyers and Merchan only approved it. Trump also claimed that Merchan had been \"hand picked by Bragg & the prosecutors\" although judges are randomly assigned and prosecutors had no role in Merchan's assignment. After the indictment, Trump and a small number of allies in the GOP advocated cutting funds for the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, with Trump saying in his social media platform that the law enforcement were weaponized by the Democrats.\nOn February 15, 2024, Trump told reporters that unnamed legal experts believe that \"even if he [Trump] was guilty of something, there is no crime.\"\nOn April 12, 2023, citing the criminal case, Trump sued Cohen for allegedly revealing his confidences and \"spreading falsehoods\" about him. On April 23, Trump praised Republicans who had supported him amid two impeachments and the criminal proceedings, contrasting this against the widely negative perception of Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal.\n\n\n==== Congress members ====\nCongressional Republicans generally condemned the indictment as unprecedented and a weaponization of justice. Some alleged the indictment constituted election interference, as Trump was an announced candidate in the November 2024 presidential election. Kevin McCarthy, the speaker of the House, tweeted: \"Alvin Bragg has irreparably damaged our country in an attempt to interfere in our Presidential election. As he routinely frees violent criminals to terrorize the public, he weaponized our sacred system of justice against President Donald Trump. The American people will not tolerate this injustice, and the House of Representatives will hold Alvin Bragg and his unprecedented abuse of power to account.\" When Senator Lindsey Graham was interviewed by Fox News, he stated that \"you need to help this man, Donald J. Trump. They're trying to drain him dry ... Go to DonaldJTrump.com and give money so he can defend himself.\"\nOn March 20, 2023, Republicans Jim Jordan, James Comer and Bryan Steil, chairs of the House Judiciary, Oversight and Administration committees, respectively, sent Bragg a letter calling for him to testify before their committees, and to provide communications, documents and testimony about the inquiry, calling the upcoming indictment an \"unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial authority.\" Later they told Bragg they might consider legislation \"to protect former and/or current Presidents from politically motivated prosecutions by state and local officials.\" Bragg's office wrote back that the requests were an \"unlawful incursion into New York's sovereignty,\" noting such information about ongoing investigations was confidential under state law. Jordan in February 2023 had received a private request from Trump's lawyer Joe Tacopina to investigate Bragg for his actions against Trump, according to The New York Times and CNN. Representative Elise Stefanik, the House Republican Conference chair, has been briefing Trump on House Republicans' committee work, including the House committees' plans to respond to Bragg, according to CNN on March 28. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a member of the House Oversight Committee, has acknowledged informing Trump of \"everything that we're doing ... He seems very plugged in at all times. Sometimes I'm shocked at how he knows all these things.\" On April 11, Bragg sued Jordan in federal court, alleging that Jordan was trying to \"intimidate and attack\" him.\nTrump-aligned representative Marjorie Taylor Greene cautioned against protests against Trump's potential indictment, warning of a repeat of the January 6 attack; she reversed this stance after the charges were actually made.  House Speaker Kevin McCarthy also discouraged protests, asserting that not even Trump wanted them. \nThe five GOP senators who had endorsed Trump's campaign said that his indictment would not alter their support for him.\n\n\n==== Other presidential candidates ====\nMany of Trump's political rivals, such as entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and former Governor of South Carolina Nikki Haley, both of whom are also running for the presidential nomination, expressed opposition to the indictment. Former vice president Mike Pence called the indictment an outrage and a \"political prosecution\". Former governor and prosecutor Chris Christie condemned Trump's conduct but said that the case was weak and should not have been brought; Christie has endorsed Jack Smith's prosecution of Donald Trump.\nFormer Governor of Arkansas and potential contender for the presidency Asa Hutchinson argued for supporting the legal process, but he also said that he hoped voters would still be able to decide for themselves if Trump should be elected. In mid-March 2023, Hutchinson argued that if indicted, Trump should withdraw his candidacy \"out of respect for the institution of the presidency\", not because it would be judicially damning but because it would distract from the election. \nRon DeSantis, the governor of Florida, the state in which Trump resides, said that the state of Florida would not assist with any extradition of Trump to New York. However, under the Extradition Clause of Article IV of the U.S. Constitution, governors cannot reject the extradition requests of other states, and the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Puerto Rico v. Branstad (1987) that federal courts can enforce this provision if needed.\n\n\n==== Others ====\nFormer national security advisor under Trump John Bolton stated that he hoped the New York prosecutors were \"very, very certain of their case\" because if they indicted but did not convict Trump, it would bolster his campaign. \nWilliam Barr, former Attorney General under Trump, gave his opinion that the Democratic strategists know this case will help Trump and they want him to be the Republican nominee because he is the \"weakest of the Republican candidates,\" and predicted that he would be defeated by Biden in the 2024 presidential election. Barr also considers that this case lacks merit, calling it \"transparently an abuse of prosecutorial power to accomplish a political end and ... an unjust case.\"\nSome Republicans, have attempted actions against Bragg on the basis of political bias, including two lawsuits from the Heritage Foundation asserting that Bragg failed to comply with freedom of information requests regarding his reputed communications with the Justice Department, the Biden administration, and/or Democratic lawmakers.\n\n\n=== Democrats ===\nDemocratic Representative Adam Schiff tweeted: \"The indictment of a former president is unprecedented. But so too is the unlawful conduct in which Trump has been engaged.\" Schiff served as the lead impeachment manager during Trump's first impeachment trial. The Biden administration said they would not take part in the public discussion. Democrats have billed the indictment as Trump being held accountable under the law. Democratic Representative Jamaal Bowman shouted \"Get the hell out of here!\" at Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene for supporting Trump during a Trump protest in New York City.\nIn tandem to the proceedings, on March 22 the New York Senate passed a bill aiming to exclude the terms of a U.S. president from the time counted by statutes of limitations, as presidential immunity could potentially be used to evade prosecution.\n\n\n=== Legal experts ===\nThe indictment raises novel and complex legal issues. Legal experts contacted by the New York Times said that the indictment combines business records charges with state election law in a way that had never previously been done in a case involving a federal campaign. According to the Associated Press, the indictment involves difficult legal issues which the defense might be able to use to get it dismissed. Law professor Richard Hasen described the ongoing federal investigations into Trump as \"much stronger both legally and factually\" than this case.\nWhile the indictment has been published, it does not reveal the District Attorney's \"specific legal theory\" behind the case; for example, it is not specific about \"how each of the charges was elevated to a felony\", nor does it \"specify the potential underlying crimes\". While the law does not require such specificity, attorney Ken White and law professor Richard Klein have commented that this makes it difficult to assess the legal merits of the case.\nOn March 28, 2024, US District Judge Reggie Walton said that Trump's social media attacks on Merchan's daughter were \"very troubling\" but that Merchan was correct not to use his gag order on Trump to protect himself and his family.\nLegal analyst Glenn Kirschner argued that Trump had broken state law by attempting to obstruct the DA's official duties. Writing for MSNBC on April 10, former U.S. attorney Barbara McQuade defended Bragg's probe, stating: \"white-collar crime is more egregious than crime committed by destitute people desperate for cash\".\nSome have argued that irrespective of charges in the hush-money scandal, Trump was equally or more seriously threatened by E. Jean Carroll's lawsuits against him (one of which he lost in May 2023, the other in January 2024), Jack Smith's special counsel investigation into both Trump's alleged mishandling of classified government records (for which he was indicted in June 2023) and the January 6 attack (leading to his indictment in August), the 2020 Georgia election investigation (for which he was indicted later in August), and the New York AG's civil investigation of the organization. Amid Trump's arrest, a number of media outlets pointed out that his father, Fred, was arrested twice (in 1927 and 1976).  As it became clear that the matter would likely be the first criminal case against a former U.S. president to go to trial, some legal experts argued that—though the truthfulness of the allegations had apparently been established—the case was the weakest of the four then under litigation.\nIn March 2023, a former Federal Election Commission (FEC) commissioner argued that it was not the province of the Manhattan DA to prosecute a federal campaign finance violation (which the \"nuisance settlement\" payment arguably did not constitute), and was instead the jurisdiction of the FEC or the Justice Department (which both reputedly knew of Trump's alleged misdeeds but chose not to prosecute him). \nJennifer Rubin, a former lawyer and, until 2020, conservative, argued that the GOP might rather lose the 2024 general election than denounce Trump. Conservative lawyer George Conway used the occasion to suggest that Trump's best (albeit unlikely) defense could be insanity.\n\n\n=== Media commentary ===\n\nThe Financial Times's Edward Luce expressed disappointment that this indictment came before the conclusion of the Smith special counsel investigation, and described the indictment as a legal technicality that is neither as serious nor as \"easy to intuit\" as the allegations concerning sedition and attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. The Financial Times's Joshua Chaffin said skeptics could compare the case to a similar one involving presidential candidate John Edwards, who obtained a mistrial after arguing that his payments were not intended to influence the election, but to protect his dying wife.\nThe Guardian's David Smith wrote that Trump has been adept at turning around allegations and playing the victim, and that his tactics will work with his base. Current and former Fox News hosts, including Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, and Tucker Carlson, expressed outrage and concern over the indictment. Trump's indictment came following the release of text messages from several Fox News hosts denouncing Trump in Dominion Voting Systems v. Fox News.\nIn February 2024, the New York Daily News carried an opinion piece by Nick Akerman, former assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York and assistant special Watergate prosecutor, who commented on the similarities with the Watergate case, and stated that Trump was facing almost certain conviction.\nNBC New York compared Trump's rhetoric in his calls for protests to that which he used before the insurrection. Two New York tabloids with typically opposite political leanings, the Daily News and the Post, condemned Trump's rhetoric in calling for protest as \"dangerous\" and \"crazy\", respectively. Comedian and political commentator Jon Stewart stated that \"The rule of law does not take into account if [an indictment] might make you a martyr to somebody.\" The New York Times wrote that the case has demonstrated both \"Bragg's skills and shortcomings as [DA] ... [namely] a keen eye for legal strategy but something of a blind spot for the way his decisions are perceived by the public\".\n\n\n=== Misinformation and conspiracy theories ===\nBefore Trump's indictment, Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins facetiously created an AI-generated image of Trump being arrested using Midjourney software. Higgins was clear that the images were fictitious and did not seek to distribute them widely. Nonetheless, social media users spread the images without clarifying their origin.\nOnce the indictment was handed down, QAnon accounts on Telegram began posting about \"trusting the plan\" and how \"the storm is upon us\", referencing conspiracy theories surrounding the \"Deep State\". Other conspiracy theories claimed that Bragg was \"bought and paid for\" by billionaire George Soros. This claim was promoted and spread by Trump himself as well as DeSantis, Senator J. D. Vance, Senator Ron Johnson, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, Representative Anna Paulina Luna, and Representative Paul Gosar, who called Bragg a \"Soros D.A.\" Although Soros did donate to progressive criminal justice reform group Color of Change, which contributed to Bragg's campaign, Soros was only one of many donors to Color of Change, and he had no contact with Bragg. Threats were also directed at Soros and Bragg. Some on Trump's social media platform Truth Social called for armed defense of Mar-a-Lago, though there seemed to be no coordinated effort to do so.\nDeepfake and other imagery created using artificial intelligence (AI) depicting Trump being arrested and/or perp walked circulated on social media with faux headlines, proving controversial and popular on both sides of the political spectrum, though for opposite reasons. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins was banned from AI program Midjourney after he used it to generate depictions of Trump being incarcerated and his creations went viral. The Associated Press noted that the filming of a protest scene for Joker: Folie à Deux in New York City coincided with Trump's unrequited calls for protest.\n\n\n== During the trial ==\n\n\n=== Self-immolation ===\n\nOn the afternoon of April 19, a man self-immolated outside the courthouse.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Durham University Conservative and Unionist Association (often pronounced 'Ducks'), formerly the Durham University Conservative Association, is a conservative student society at Durham University. It was founded in 1935. It is affiliated with the Durham Students' Union.\nIts alumni include a some senior figures within the Conservative Party, notably Sir Graham Brady and Sir Edward Leigh.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first annual dinner was held by the Durham University Conservative and Unionist Association 24 January 1934. It was held in the School of Art in Armstrong College. It has also been described as the first meeting, and the first president of the association was in attendance: Lord Castlereagh.Ironically, the Durham branch of the Association, from which the current association is descended, was not the first branch of the association. When it was founded in late 1935, the Newcastle section, then called the Armstrong College (Newcastle) branch, had already been in existence for some years.By the 1950s, the name was firmly established as the Durham University Conservative Association.In 2016, protests over Godfrey Bloom being invited to speak saw his event held in a pub. When asked by The Times about protesters outside the pub, the Association president commented \"Yahboo and sucks to the lefties who were protesting outside - I hope you got cold.\"In 2020 the Association was removed from the Student Union Student Group Register over 'fascist, racist, antisemitic and misogynistic' comments allegedly made by members. The Association responded by condemning and changed the group's name to the Durham Unionist Conservative Association. Some committee members resigned in protest over the accusations. The Association has since been returned to the Register under its current name.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIn 2016 it was highlighted that the Association was larger than the Durham Labour Club, suggesting a general right-wing lean to Durham students, as opposed to the conventional left-wing lean of most UK university students.The swiftness of the Associations removable by the Student's Union in 2020 has been remarked by some commentators as indicative of the revisionist nature of the Students' Union, and of cancel culture more widely. They hold that it is a move by the Union to remove conservatism from the university, and attacks the Oxbridge-character that the university has maintained since its inception. Others have claimed that this character is toxic to all but social elites, with class contempt and jokes about the north-south divide openly exhibited, with the accusations made of the Association are not uncommon behaviours.

        "content": "The Brauerei Hofstetten Krammer GmbH & Co KG is a beer brewery in the municipality of Sankt Martin im Mühlkreis (Upper Austria). It is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the oldest brewery in Austria.\n\n\n== History ==\nHofstetten was first mentioned in CE 1229 as the property of the Pibersteiner, whereby it is assumed that beer for the restaurant was already brewed in the manor house with a rest area on the Via Regia. At that time, today's Hofstetten brewery was probably used as a restaurant for the traveling salesmen of the Salt Road, which ran through the middle of St. Martin. In fact, a brewery in Hofstetten was mentioned in a document in 1449 in the Urbar of Wallsee. With this year, the Hofstetten brewery was also named in the Guinness Book of Records as the oldest brewery in Austria. The earliest brewery coat of arms is preserved on a pewter plate from CE 1560.\nAfter the company was initially a manorial brewery, it later became a privately owned company. From CE 1728, there is a production of 680 buckets. In 1795/97 the output was 1809 buckets. In CE 1847, the cattle dealer Kaspar Krammer, a cattle dealer from Ottau (Bohemia), bought the indebted estate at auction. Since that year, the brewery has been owned by the Krammer family. In CE 1925/26 the output was 2145 hectolitres, in CE 1929 the capacities were expanded with a used brewhouse.\nIn CR 1998, Peter Krammer took over the brewery from his father Franz and outsourced the bottling to the Stiftsbrauerei Schlägl. In CR 1999, the offer of guided tours was expanded and the tasting room was renovated. Between CE 2000 and CE 2008, output increased from 5000 hl to 5700 hl and finally to 8,000 hl in CR 2016. In particular, Peter Krammer greatly expanded the range of special and strong beers. Since September CE 2008, he has also been exporting beer to the USA. In 2016, the new brewhouse was put into operation. State-of-the-art technology, these new systems ensure energy savings of 50 percent. In addition to the modern, fully automated brewhouse, the historic brewhouse from CE 1929 is still in use. There, old beers, such as the Bio Heines Altes Lager, the Granitbock and the Original Wedding Beer, are still brewed authentically and by hand.\nCurrently, about half of the beers are brewed in organic quality and with 100 percent raw materials from the Mühlviertel region. The close cooperation with the approximately 20 organic barley farmers from the surrounding communities and hop farmers from the Mühlviertel also strengthens the added value in the area.\nThe Hofstetten brewery is also active in the Mühlviertel brewery cooperation \"Bierviertel\". Since the beginning of 2022, the brewery has been a member of the \"Association of Independent Private Breweries of Austria\", which is committed to preserving Austrian beer and brewing culture.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nConrad Seidl: Our beer.

In 2013, TNA discontinued most of its monthly pay-per-view events in favor of the new pre-recorded One Night Only events. It was revived as a special episode of Impact! that aired on March 29, 2019. On April 11, 2024, TNA announced that the 2024 Against All Odds would take place on June 14, 2024, at the Cicero Stadium in Cicero, Illinois.\n\n\n=== Storylines ===\nThe event will feature several professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers portray heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that build tension and culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches. Storylines are produced on TNA's weekly programs, Impact! and Xplosion.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website",

        "content": "Vasco Porcallo de Figueroa (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈbasko poɾˈkaʎo ðe fiˈɣeɾoa]; Cáceres, Extremadura, Spain, c. 1494 – Puerto Príncipe, Cuba, 1550) was a Spanish conquistador. He played a significant role in the early colonization of the Americas, including the subjugation of the Higüey and Jaragua provinces under Nicolás de Ovando's governorship in Santo Domingo. Porcallo de Figueroa founded several settlements in Cuba, including Sancti Spíritus and what later became Remedios, but in the time after its founding was called \"Santa Cruz de la Savana de Vasco Porcallo\". He became notorious for his brutal treatment of the indigenous Siboneyes, and is also recognized for importing the first African slaves to Cuba.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nVasco Porcallo de Figueroa was born in Cáceres, Spain, into a noble family with connections to the Portuguese nobility and the Spanish Counts of Feria. After serving in military campaigns in Spain and Italy, he traveled to the Americas, arriving in Santo Domingo in 1502 under the sponsorship of Governor Nicolás de Ovando.\nHe testified on January 28, 1522, that he was 28 years old, which, if true, would mean that he was born in 1494. More than one source includes the report that Porcallo fled Spain to escape the law, having murdered a cousin over a family inheritance. It is possible that he was concealing his true age to avoid identification, because if true, he would likely be too young to come to the Caribbean with Nicolás de Ovando and participate in the conquest of Hispaniola.\n\n\n=== Early exploits ===\nUnder Ovando, Porcallo contributed significantly to the subjugation of the Higüey and Jaragua provinces, receiving large land grants and control over local indigenous populations as rewards.\n\n\n=== Founding of Cuban settlements ===\nIn 1514, as one of Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar's captains, Porcallo was assigned to the conquest of the island of Cuba, where he founded the towns of Puerto Príncipe, Sancti Spiritus, San Juan de los Remedios, and Trinidad. He owned a country property called La Sabana, located near Remedios, where he made a great fortune from his plantations and mines worked by his Siboney slaves. His governance was marked by harsh rule, and several source corroborate his atrocities against the native population.\n\n\n=== Later years and controversies ===\nPorcallo's rule was characterized by brutality towards the indigenous Siboneyes, often raiding their villages and enslaving them. Despite his ruthless reputation, some contemporaries like Bishop Diego Sarmiento depicted him as a generous and vital figure in sustaining the colonial settlements. In the previously mentioned testification from 1522, it is brought to light that he cut off the genitals and limbs of four male natives, and made them eat their own privates, and then made them eat dirt. One would later commit suicide, while the other three died from eating dirt.In the 1530s, facing the depletion of native labor forces, Porcallo was among the first to import African slaves to work his lands.\n\n\n== Expedition to Florida ==\nIn 1539, despite his advanced age, Porcallo joined Hernando de Soto's expedition to Florida, intending to capture slaves. He quickly returned to Cuba due to the hardships encountered, leaving his illegitimate son, Gómez de Figueroa, in Florida.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nPorcallo married Tínima, the daughter of a local cacique, and was known for having numerous indigenous concubines. He reportedly fathered over a hundred children, some of whom, along with their mothers, reportedly committed suicide.\nThe names of his known children are:\nLeonor de la Cerda\nTeresa de la Cerda Sotomayor y Casenda, married to Esteban de Lagos Mejías\nMaría de Figueroa, married to Capitán Juan de Argote\nElvira Lasso de la Vega, married to Martín de Rojas, son of Manuel de Rojas and Magdalena Velázquez\nVasco Porcallo de Figueroa\nCristóbal Porcallo de Figueroa\nLorenzo Gómez Juárez de Figueroa\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nPorcallo died in 1550 in Puerto Príncipe, a city he founded. His legacy is controversial; remembered as both a pioneering colonizer and a brutal encomendero. His actions significantly shaped the early colonial history of Cuba but also led to severe indigenous suffering and displacement.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Carlos Meléndez Latorre  (born 26 January 1957) is a Spanish former footballer who played as a goalkeeper. After making over 100 lower-division appearances in his early career, he spent a decade as a squad member with La Liga clubs Athletic Bilbao and RCD Espanyol but was rarely selected, instead becoming known as a dependable backup to the regular starters who missed very few matches; he was easily recognisable in his habitual place on the substitutes' bench due to his large moustache.\n\n\n== Career ==\nRaised in Getxo, Meléndez began his career locally at Arenas Club, where his coach at youth level was Javier Clemente. He quickly moved on to CD Basconia (signed by Clemente) then to Athletic Bilbao, where he became one of several contenders for the goalkeeping position held for many years by veteran José Ángel Iribar; initially the older Peio Agirreoa was ahead of Meléndez in the 'queue' to start, then the younger Andoni Cedrún spent the majority of the 1980–81 season as the regular after Meléndez failed to convince in a short spell.\nClemente, who had also joined Athletic and moved up through the youths and reserves, became head coach in 1981 and immediately installed Andoni Zubizarreta as the starter ahead of both Cedrún and Meléndez – Zubi would barely miss a match in the next five years (and would go on to become the all-time appearance record holder in Spanish football) as Athletic won two La Liga titles and a Copa del Rey, Meléndez remaining on the sidelines as a trusted alternative which proved not to be needed. Clemente was dismissed by Athletic in January of 1986 and was appointed by RCD Espanyol five months later, quickly moving to sign Meléndez who was now unwanted in Bilbao even though Zubizarreta had also departed.\nAny chances Meléndez had of replacing the Espanyol incumbent Thomas N'Kono diminished when he contracted hepatitis causing him to miss his first preseason with his new teammates, and he had to settle for a backup role again. His most notable appearances came during the Pericos' run to the 1988 UEFA Cup final when N'Kono was injured, and in the 1989–90 Segunda División promotion play-off (after their relegation in the previous campaign which had seen Clemente sacked) in which he saved a penalty in the shootout victory over CD Málaga. However, though N'Kono left the club, Vicente Biurrun was brought in (also from Athletic Bilbao) and Meléndez had another two years as a substitute before retiring.\nHe later had roles as a goalkeeping coach and scout at Athletic Bilbao.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nAthletic Bilbao \n\nLa Liga: 1982–83, 1983–84\nCopa del Rey: 1983–84; runner-up 1984–85\nEspanyol \n\nUEFA Cup: Runner-up 1987–88\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCarlos Meléndez at BDFutbol\nCarlos Meléndez at Athletic Bilbao",

        "content": "Stanisław Józef Moskal, alias Śledź Otrembus Podgrobelski (born 4 March 1935 in Kraków, died there on 8 May 2019) was a Polish scientist and writer, a rural sociologist, a professor of agricultural science, associated with the Agricultural University of Kraków. He researched cultural transformations and determinants of development in Polish villages, particularly the ecological awareness of its inhabitants. He was knowledgeable about the local subdialects of Podhale. A lover of mountains, ethnologist, and traveler. For many years, he studied the determinants of agricultural development in Algeria.\nHe authored Introduction to imaginescopy in the form of a satirical treatise, the fictitious methodology and stylization of which were used by readers in various practical and theoretical applications. He created the character Jeremiasz Apollon Hytz, to whom he attributed many theses related to imaginescopy. The book, first published in 1977, became the subject of numerous literary, logological, and philosophical analyses, as well as a famous topic for many blogs. The concept of imaginescopy proved to be an inspiration for numerous and innovative artistic experiments. Interest in it has particularly developed in the 21st century.\nThe author's professional experience as a scientist and sociologist is reflected in the humorous scientific text, which is compared to the works of leading representatives of similar prose genres. The author wrote under the pseudonym \"Śledź Otrembus Podgrobelski\". In 2012, he also published a volume of his own memoirs.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHe was the son of Stanisław (1903–1984) and Jadwiga née Jordan (1908–1964). His father was an engineer and technical director of a chemical factory producing soap and vegetable fats in Trzebinia. His mother was a teacher and came from the historical family of former salt żupniks of Wieliczka, whose members distinguished themselves in the November Uprising and the Hungarian Revolution.\nHe was born in Kraków. He was strongly connected to his family's (on his father's side) village of Sułkowice near the Beskids and its traditions, where he experienced the German occupation. He graduated from high school in 1952 at one of the oldest Polish schools (established in 1588) – Bartłomiej Nowodworski High School, whose graduates included his grandfather and uncle.\n\nHe completed his studies in zootechnics (1957) at the Agricultural University of Kraków, and then studied sociology (1965) at the Jagiellonian University. From 1960, he worked at the Agricultural University of Kraków as an assistant, and from 1965 as a senior assistant in the Department (from 1970, Institute) of Agricultural Economics and Organization. In 1970, based on his dissertation Non-agricultural work as a factor of change in the farm and peasant family of Podhale, he obtained a doctorate in agricultural sciences and was employed as an assistant professor. In 1978, he obtained his habilitation based on the work Dual-occupation population in the process of socio-economic rural development.\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, he spent a year working on a farm in the small town of Belmont-sur-Yverdon in the French-speaking canton of Vaud in Switzerland, thanks to which he gained significant experience working and living in Swiss society compared to the economic and social conditions in Poland at that time. In 1971, he visited Siberia during a scientific internship in Novosibirsk. During the academic year 1973/1974, he spent a research scholarship in Algeria. In 1975, he visited the surroundings of Uzhhorod in Carpathian Ruthenia. From 1976 to 1979, he was an economic consultant at the Institute of Animal Science in Balice.\nHe returned to Algeria from 1979 to 1986 and worked at the Higher Agricultural School (now ENSA) in El Harrach on the outskirts of Algiers. There, he lectured on economic development issues, agricultural economics, and prepared a detailed feed balance sheet for Algeria on behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture. He also conducted numerous field trips, including into the Sahara desert.\nAt the same time, from 1979, he was employed at the Agricultural University of Kraków as a docent in the Department of Agricultural Policy, and from 1994 as an associate professor at the Department of Sociology and Rural Development. In 1989, he was awarded the Golden Cross of Merit.\nIn 1992, he participated in a study visit at Université Laval in Canada. He received the title of professor of agricultural sciences in 2000. From 1994 to 2004, he was the head of the newly established Department of Sociology and Rural Development at the university. He retired in 2007.\nHe passed away on 8 May 2019 in Kraków, and was buried at Rakowicki Cemetery (section P, row 2, grave 18).\n\n\n== Scientific work ==\n\nHis scientific output comprises over 220 interdisciplinary works, bridging the fields of rural sociology and agricultural economics. The topics of his works include issues related to the transformation of agriculture in the process of economic development, changes in the socio-economic structure of the population, the functioning of peasant farms, labor resources in rural areas, as well as cultural and civilizational aspects of rural development, including the ecological awareness of its inhabitants.\nHe authored a frequently reissued academic textbook on rural sociology and two monographs analyzing non-agricultural work in peasant families in the Podhale region. The first monograph, which served as his doctoral thesis, examined the challenging living and working conditions of peasant workers in the 1970s in the fragmented agricultural farms in the villages of Gronie and Ostrowsko in the Podhale region, who worked in a shoe factory in Nowy Targ. He also authored monographic studies on the situation of rural youth in Poland and on agriculture in Algeria. He collaborated with universities in Rennes, Paris, and Montpellier, as well as in Nitra and Prešov.\nHe studied cultural changes in Polish villages, particularly the regional phenomenon of dual employment in rural areas and rural overpopulation. He noted that despite the visible civilizational progress in rural areas at the beginning of the 21st century and household equipment comparable to urban areas, a large part of rural youth – unlike their parents' generation – critically assesses the countryside as a place to live and expresses professional aspirations associated with urban and non-agricultural sectors of the economy. Rural youth consider their own non-agricultural business as the optimal solution.\nHe developed a program for the development of agricultural areas and analyzed initiatives undertaken by urban-rural and rural municipalities to activate local communities and direct economic transformations in rural areas in the situation of fragmented rural farms. He particularly studied the psychological determinants of the reconstruction of villages in Lesser Poland. Based on survey research conducted in 2000 in the voivodeships of Lesser Poland and Subcarpathia, he proposed solutions for creating alternative job opportunities to agriculture.\n\nHe introduced quantitative methods for studying the ecological awareness of rural residents. He demonstrated that at the end of the 20th century, two-thirds of respondents in Lesser Poland perceived environmental degradation in rural areas mainly due to deforestation, wild landfills, progressive land development, and unattractive architecture. His literary works reflect his knowledge of the folklore of southern Poland's foothills.\nHe served as an advisor to agricultural state and local government institutions. He was a member of the board of the Lesser Poland Rural Development Program and the team for Agricultural Unemployment in Kraków, and participated in training programs of the Lesser Poland Association of Agricultural Advisory Services. He consulted study trips and seminars to France and Ukraine for the Rural Areas Renewal Association Wieś i Europa from 2000 to 2002. He criticized the system of direct payments granted to Polish farmers by the European Union.\nSince 1997, he was a member of the editorial board of Krakowskie Studia Małopolskie and since 2002 of the quarterly journal of the Polish Academy of Sciences Wieś i Rolnictwo. He supervised three doctoral dissertations in Algeria and three in Poland, the last of which was conducted at the Institute for Rural Development and Agriculture of the Polish Academy of Sciences in 2005.\nIn the characterization of social-economic representatives in Kraków in 2015, he was considered a \"significant figure\" in this community and was described as \"focused on science, with a very solid methodological scientific background, and rather avoiding popularity without direct reference to science\".\n\n\n== Literary works ==\n\n\n=== Introduction to imaginescopy ===\n\nHe was the author of the text and drawings of the satirical Introduction to imaginescopy in a literary form of a \"pastiche of scientific text\". The book was first published in 1977 by Wydawnictwo Literackie under the pseudonym \"Śledź Otrembus Podgrobelski\" – his surname as the author is listed in library catalogs, a review from 1979, bibliographic data from 1986, and some biographies, while the author's note in the 1998 edition indicates that the author was associated with Kraków.\nThe Introduction to imaginescopy also includes a bibliography of fictional scientific sources (30 items) which were described in a specialized lexicon in 2016. The fictitious creator of imaginescopy and the related pendology was the pharmacist-philosopher Jeremiasz Apollon Hytz (1841–1914) from Pidhaitsi – the author of the sentence \"before whose logic even the most skeptical minds must yield: Every effect has its cause\".\nThe author provided a description of imaginescopy:\n\nThe immediate means, stimulating the imagination through the sense of sight, and thus imaginescope – is any perforation perforating any solid substance to the end that through its orifice one might conduct perhaps one straight line.\nImaginescopy is a method of expanding imagination, the strengthening of which depends on the type of imaginescope used and its hypothetical technical parameters, which the book analyzes in a scientific style. The relationship between fiction and authenticity of these definitions and descriptions is complex, and \"the separation of their scopes ceases to be solely a matter of simple assessment\". The connection of imagination understood in this way \"with art, and especially with poetry, still seems natural, common, and obvious\".\nThe Introduction to imaginescopy \"is essentially a 'fable' – a false apocrypha exposing the myth of objectivity and relativity of science\". The book \"imitates authenticity only to reveal its own falseness, and then to maintain it again\". \"The basic function of parody in Podgrobelski's book is to suggest literary quality,\" which can be understood similarly to the literary quality of contemporary Silva rerum. The book \"seems ostentatiously playful\", and its language is a pastiche of the formal scientific text used by the author in his professional scientific activity with mocking additions of the language known to him from the inhabitants of Podhale, as in the quote:\n\nPendoptics (otherwise: synoptics pendological) deals with forecasting pendoptic conditions in the near and distant future with an effect similar to that of meteorology. The grandfather Stopka, who was once observed on Hala Gąsienicowa, will remain a model for workers in both of these fields forever. He created absolutely reliable three pendoptic theses of grandfather Stopka:\nThesis I: – hy, gmy idom dołu, pijom wode ... Bedzie loć!\nThesis II: – hy, gmy idom hore, napiły sie ... Bedzie loć!\n\nThesis III: – hy, gmy ni ma... Bedzie loć!In 1979, Jerzy Kmita, a philosopher and cultural theorist, compared the message of the Introduction to imaginescopy with the anti-positivist theses of Wilhelm Dilthey. Imaginescopy collaborates interdisciplinary with ethnography, archaeology, and especially with sociology and statistics, enriching them with practical aspects. According to Kmita, J.A. Hytz's theory assumes \"that to empathize well, one must have a sufficiently broad imagination\" and that \"empathy is theoretically the most correct cognitive method\". Without imaginescopy, \"we do not possess proper, sufficiently developed insight into academic humanities\". In the same year, Jerzy Pomorski pointed out the identity of Stanisław Moskal and Śledź Otrembus Podgrobelski, as well as the similarity of Podhale topics and interest in highland culture, including language, between Moskal's doctoral work and his Introduction to imaginescopy, which he called \"a great Parkinsonian joke\" and \"a form of self-control rarely practiced by scientists today, to exaggerate slightly\". The reviewer of the first edition of the Introduction to imaginescopy wrote in 1979:\nAlthough the scope of practical applications of imaginescopy may already be impressive today, the future prospects exceed the boldest imaginings.\n\n\n==== Literary and philosophical aspects ====\nThe Introduction to Imaginescopy and its form of a satirical scientific treatise have become the subject of literary analysis and interest on internet blogs. Reviews of the book compared it to the works of Sławomir Mrożek and Jaroslav Hašek as well as Cyril Parkinson and Edward Murphy. It was called a \"literary delicacy\". The author's \"phenomenal sense of humor played on a thin string\" was noted. One blogger stated that \"if Monty Python wrote books, they would have written their own Introduction to imaginescopy\".\n\nThe Introduction to imaginescopy served as source material for mathematical discussions, and the methodological principle of imaginescopy of determining \"what is what\" was invoked in detailed mathematical discussions as well as in a dissertation on the state of philosophy. The concept of imaginescopy in another philosophical dissertation was seen as \"a better approximation of the function that imaginary representation fulfills in an intentional act\". The content of the book also became an \"important\" basis for considerations on the ethics of historical discussions in order to \"deepen and broaden\" them. The usefulness of imaginescopy in assessing poetry dealing with fundamental issues was also noted, considering the \"threshold of social intolerance in the case of overly extravagant imagination\".\nIn 2012, an international onomastic conference organized by the Faculty of Philology of the University of Łódź and dedicated to toponymy placed the names of places mentioned in the Introduction to imaginescopy \"between comedy and stylization\". Imaginescopy also became the subject of interest in logic. The thesis of Śledź Otrembus Podgrobelski, that \"one must rely on facts, and they speak for themselves – for they are facts that speak volumes\" was accepted as a \"classic\" principle in describing the achievements of academic teaching and research teams. The style and concepts used in the Introduction to imaginescopy were useful in teaching foreign languages, in texts popularizing mathematics and astronomy, as well as in didactic method related to medical epidemiology.\nThe book also inspired the creation of science fiction, preparation of cabaret performances, and was an element of analysis in computer games. Its usefulness in film adaptations of non-literary materials was noted, as imaginescopy represents a \"metaphor for science fiction\" and also focuses on the \"relationships between the future, humans, and technology\". It found practical application in coaching, where training cards \"act like classic imaginescopes\". It was used in numismatic descriptions. In 2019, the use of imaginescopy was an argument in a discussion about the 1960 film Knights of the Teutonic Order.\n\nThe content of the Introduction to imaginescopy \"expands the reader's imagination\" similar to Stanisław Lem's fiction, to whom the authorship of this book was attributed. The author of the Introduction to imaginescopy was called a \"Kraków sage\" with \"profound erudition\". The fictional habilitation thesis of the \"famous Śledź Otrembus Podgrobelski can teach us better than anything else what a scholarly style is and how, in striving to achieve it, not to make oneself too ridiculous\". The Introduction to imaginescopy was considered a model of constructing a scholarly dissertation.\nA passage from the alleged writings of Jeremiasz Apollon Hytz: \"By multiplying anything, we enlarge reality, which begins to surpass imagination\" was perceived as close to the modernists' observations on the concept of reality. In a literary essay from 2002, attention was drawn to another important thought of Jeremiasz: \"Every Darkwood has its avant-garde, but every avant-garde also has its Darkwood\".\nThe choral group of the tourist song \"Society for Enlarging Imagination in the Name of Apollon Hytz\" was formed in Choszczno in 2002 and received several artistic awards. In 2010, the name Hytz and the history of imaginescopy appeared on the BBC News blog. Jeremiasz Apollon Hytz was included in the list of participants in the jubilee celebrations held at the University of Silesia in 2011.\n\nThe use of imaginescope in nature allows one to be a \"creator\" and see \"one's own image\". A fictional medieval imaginescope was identified in 2013 within the walls of the 14th-century Sobień Castle. A natural specimen of the imaginescope \"Jabcon\" from a fragment of a thousand-year-old sequoia was found in 1999 in Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park in northern California.\nŚledź Otrembus Podgrobelski approaches the possibility of \"scientifically\" shaping imagination very seriously, but \"the way he does it questions the entire concept\". In 2001, Śledź's book was nominated in Przekrój newmagazine for the \"funniest book in the world\". The Introduction to imaginescopy was submitted in 2009 by the publisher to the XVIII Nationwide Review of Travel and Tourist Books in Poznań. Another reprint was released in 2016. Each edition is marked as \"revised and not corrected\".\nThe book was classified by readers as one of a dozen \"extraordinary bestsellers for April Fools' Day\" and among the twelve books that \"shaped Filip Łobodziński\", who described it as \"pure nonsense, a stream of pseudoscientific subconsciousness, a gallop of concepts, and a wonderful read for multiple uses\".\nOrganizers of the \"Manifestations of Poetry\" festival in Warsaw in 2005 encouraged participants to create \"imaginescopes in their spare time\" according to Śledź's description. In 2019, the Introduction to imaginescopy was publicly read in Warsaw during the \"Amazing\" Book Festival. That same year, Stanisław Tym wrote, \"Today I have dozens of imaginescopes, and I've made most of them myself\".\nThe research method and abstractions proposed by Śledź Otrembus Podgrobelski find many interested parties who adapt them to their purposes. The need for using imaginescopy and various ways to expand imagination by university students was demonstrated in discussions on anthropological and archaeological topics based on Śledź's text. During the Student Conference of Friends of Archaeology in Lublin in 2017, the introduction of imaginescopy into the archaeology curriculum was advocated. In 2019, the principles of imaginescopy were successfully applied to the archaeological reconstruction of the history of Żmigród hill in Opatów. This research was related to the concept of the Żmij, a winged dragon from the beliefs of ancient Slavs, and its traces in Lesser Poland.\nOver time, the author of the Introduction to imaginescopy is recognized as a \"bold classic\", and his remarks on imaginescopy and pendology, being \"pseudo-knowledge\", are seen as universal in relation to \"non-fictional, institutionalized science\". According to analysts, Śledź Otrembus Podgrobelski has shifted science \"to the position of one of many equal narratives\". The author has been described as one of the writers \"who didn't want to be them at all\". Imaginescope and imaginescopy have become useful concepts in numerous blogs and small literary forms. Śledź's book belongs to the texts of \"new\" prose, which \"built their own conceptualizations of authenticity\" and attempted to \"free fiction from the rigors of servitude\". The parody of scientific discourse in the Introduction to imaginescopy is an effective way of giving the author's statements \"the characteristics of a work of art\".\n\nImaginescopy, with its conceptual arsenal and inflated institutional life, still serves as a cipher by which supporters of higher humor recognize each other.During the conference \"Safety, Peace, Education – Priorities of Ukrainian Children's Education\" held in Wałbrzych on 23 March 2022, Polish teachers supporting Ukrainian refugees were recommended educational materials with therapeutic value. It was proposed, among other things, to \"use the imaginescope – an imaginative device that allows to stimulate the imagination and enrich it with optimistic elements of reality\". Imaginescopes are indeed \"an effective therapeutic tool that allows to find and experience positive emotions\".\nIn 2022, Radio Kraków broadcast a program on the significance of imaginescopy in expanding natural imagination. In 2023, Szczepan Twardoch stated that the book by Śledź Otrembus Podgrobelski \"is truly monstrously funny\".\n\n\n==== Artistic aspects ====\n\nA group of artists from Bochum used a fictional computational theory described in the Introduction to imaginescopy and presented an artistic document in a German museum gallery in 2004 related to the form of literary text. This project was associated with another artistic experiment – the interpretation of the symbolism of sounds and signs, in this case resembling the imaginescope \"hole\" of the letter O. At the same exhibition, objects inspired by this concept were shown, as well as a new variation of the wooden imaginescope resembling the reproduced drawing of the \"classic imaginescope of Jabcon\". This modified imaginescope model, equipped with \"double hole protection\", was exhibited in 2008 at the Anna Akhmatova Museum in St. Petersburg.\nThe book by Śledź also inspired an artistic installation called Imaginoscope by Leszek Lewandowski, which was exhibited in 2015 at the Galeria Bielska BWA and later purchased by the Arsenal Gallery in Białystok. This optical-kinetic installation uses a rotating cylinder that projects light spirals onto the walls of the room. Viewers undergo various perceptual disturbances and states close to hypnosis. Lewandowski artistically influences the imagination of the audience and \"arranges a situation balancing on the border of playing with the viewer and experiments with illusion, to provoke viewers to reflect on uncritically internalized images of the world\", as well as confronting them with the \"essentially unfathomable power of imagination\" according to the description by Śledź Otrembus Podgrobelski.\nIn 2019, the use of imaginescope principles was noted in outdoor spatial installations by sculptor Mauro Staccioli, exhibited on hills around the town of Volterra in Tuscany. The minimalist installations harmonize with the landscape and give the observer \"the opportunity to change the perspective\".\nThe statement by Jeremiasz Apollon Hytz that \"By multiplying anything, we enlarge reality, which begins to surpass imagination\" also served as inspiration for a carpenter-artist who, in the second decade of the 21st century in Stare Kawkowo in Warmia, runs an applied arts gallery offering various portable imaginescopes. In nearby Brąswałd, wooden imaginescopes are constructed for children, which \"develop imagination instead of replacing it\". In 1979, the introduction of the import of \"imaginescope industry products\" was proposed.\nThe concept of imaginescope has also been adapted by a painter, art critic, graphic designer, photographer, theater researcher, theater economics specialist, as well as a specialist in sociology of social change. Another example of imaginescopy application is a pinhole camera.\nIn 2021, the role of imaginescopy in the sculptural work of Leopold Buczkowski was analyzed by Ewa Klekot. In the same year, it was noted that the application of imaginescopy concepts in architecture enables a \"useful contribution to the answer to the question why? and to prospective thinking\".\nIn 2023, an exhibition titled Imaginescopes by sculptor Magdalena Szadkowska was opened in Łódź, who considers imaginescopes as \"emotional objects that are to become a bridge to journey into the depths of one's own imagination\". In the same year, during the 31st International Competition of Goldsmithing Art in Legnica, she received the Inhorgenta Munich Trade Fair award, as well as several other distinctions, for the concept of two rings named Imaginescope (I and II) capable of \"enlarging imagination\" made of blackened paper and brass, as well as paper and silver. The artist also creates large outdoor sculptures.\n\n\n=== Niegdysiejsze śniegi, niegdysiejsze mgły ===\n\nStanisław Moskal, under the same pseudonym, wrote the memoir volume Niegdysiejsze śniegi, niegdysiejsze mgły in 2012. \"A capital work,\" wrote a reviewer, \"we read it aloud with my wife, savoring it...\" The reviewer pointed out the author's rural and mountain fascination – first Sułkowice near Kraków, then the highland village of Kowaniec near Nowy Targ, later the Bieszczady Mountains, wanderings with his wife \"Szprotka\" in the Gorce Mountains, Tatras, and finally Wierzbanowa, where he built a house.\nHis father, Stanisław, was born in the Pod Groblą house in Sułkowice, leaving behind extensive memoir manuscripts. The name of the house inspired the adoption of the literary pseudonym \"Podgrobelski\". The author spent his student summer months with his uncle Władysław, which provided an opportunity for numerous hikes and getting to know the atmosphere of the Beskid countryside. He became a lover of folklore and an expert in the local subdialects of Podhale. Being both a sociologist and an economist of rural areas, he got to know these regions \"deeper than their inhabitants\".\nAfter completing his initial studies, he did a year-long internship on a farm in Switzerland, then traveled through Siberia and spent many years in the desert of Algeria. Everywhere, he was interested in the local geographic, landscape, and ethnographic values, which he described in his memoir book.\nTogether with his wife, he embarked on a camel expedition across the desert from Tamanrasset to the foothills of the Hoggar Mountains on the border between Algeria and Niger. In 1987, one of the Algerian national parks – the Ahaggar National Park – was established in this area.\nThe author takes the reader through the stages and places of his life, often exotic, from the perspective of a scientist with international experience, to whom \"fate designated Polishness as the soil of his roots\". \"For Śledź, the mountains and sails become a religion, travel, movement, (...) and the world of general concepts and written with capital letters values and rules is thrown into the cabaret, into the domain of wit and mockery\".\nIn the conclusion of these memoirs, he wrote, \"that although I can do little now, I must even less, and yet the grand must remains, but the non-must still winks\".\n\n\n== Other information ==\n\nHe was a lover of the Tatra Mountains and Podhale region. The concept of the Introduction to imaginescopy was developed in the 1960s during stays at Hala Gąsienicowa in a small mountain hut called Betlejemka, which mainly attracted young mountaineers and skiers. The shelter was built around 1914 by the Bustrycki family. In 1964, at the initiative of Śledź (Stanisław Moskal), the International Bureau for the Expansion of Imagination was established there. During this period, the name Betlejemka began to be used. Above the door hung a sign: \"Betlejemka. High Mountain Hut in the name of Jeremiasz Apollon Hytz\". Inside, there was a plaque commemorating his achievements (\"Even a worm marvels at the achievements of J. A. Hytz\"). His fundamental achievement was proving that \"every effect has its cause\". The atmosphere of Betlejemka, in the political and social conditions of that time, greatly contributed to the creation of the satirical concept of imaginescopy and the character of Jeremiasz Apollon Hytz. In 1972, Stanisław Moskal participated in negotiations between the High Mountain Club and the Tatra National Park regarding the establishment of a mountaineering school in Betlejemka.\nThe International Bureau for the Expansion of Imagination operated before the first publication of the Introduction to imaginescopy in 1977. During the 7th Nationwide Tourist Song Fair in Szklarska Poręba in 1974, the bureau promoted \"an optimistic view of the world using a device called the persight-imaginoscope\". Later, the Bureau moved its activities to Kuków and in 2004 was described on the map of the Babiogórskie and Jałowieckie Range.\nStanisław Moskal was also a sailor, skier, horseback rider, and traveler. He most eagerly returned to the southern Polish mountains and their inhabitants, to whom he dedicated his professional sociological research. When he began work on the Introduction to imaginescopy, later called a \"cult outlaw book\", he was a sociology student after completing agricultural studies and with international professional experience. He wrote the autobiography Niegdysiejsze śniegi, niegdysiejsze mgły (Former Snows, Former Mists) \"for my grandchildren\" from the perspective of the years 2007–2011 in his favorite place, Wierzbanowa in the Island Beskids mountains. In the wooden house he built there in the local style, he collected exhibits for his own ethnographic museum.\nHe claimed to be passionate about ethnography, ethnology, and the history of civilization.\n\n\n== Commemoration ==\nMemoirs have appeared on online portals and internet forums, as well as in printed publications. A text in an academic journal states that he was \"an extraordinary person\" who \"helped young scholars find their own imaginescope\".\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Professor Stanisław Moskal, Doctor of Engineering, habilitated doctor of science\".

        "content": "Camp Yitzhak is an IDF base in the center of the Golan Heights. The base, also known as Camp Nafah, serves as the headquarters of the 210th Division, the IDF division stationed in the Golan Heights. Until January 2014, the camp served as the headquarters of the 36th Division.\n\n\n== Camp ==\nThe camp is located about three kilometres southwest of Mount Shifon, near the ruins of Kafr Naffakh – a village whose inhabitants, Turkmen Muslims, abandoned it during the Six-Day War. The camp stands at the intersection of two main roads in the Golan Heights – Highway 91 (the road leading from Gesher Benot Ya'aqov to Quneitra) and the Petroleum Road.\nAfter the Six-Day War, the camp was used by the Alexandroni Brigade, which was responsible for the Golan Heights area. It was named after Lt. Col. Yitzhak Halfon, a battalion commander in the brigade, who fell in the battle on the Golan Heights in the Six-Day War.\nA few kilometres east of the base at the foot of Mount Shifon stands a monument to the fallen of the 679th Brigade.\n\n\n== Battles at the Camp ==\nOn the first day of the Yom Kippur War, the headquarters of 36th Division (then under the command of Brigadier General Rafael Eitan) was found in the camp and the forward command group of the Northern Command was located there.\nWhen the war broke out, Syrian planes attacked the camp. Due to its strategic location, the Syrian forces that broke into the plateau directed their main attack towards it. On the second day of the war, October 7, the camp was evacuated, after Syrian tanks approached it from the south. The tanks trampled the fences of the camp and fired into it, but were stopped and pushed away that day by IDF soldiers, including Efi Eitam who was awarded the Medal of Distinguished Service, who fired bazooka bombs at them from inside the camp and then by Israeli tanks that sensed the place.\nOn October 8 and 9, the Syrians carried out additional attacks in an attempt to capture the camp, but the IDF blocked the attacks in the area south of it. On October 9, a patrol force from the Sayeret Matkal, under the command of Yoni Netanyahu, which served as an elite patrol company in the 36th Division, was dispatched to Camp Nafah following notification of the infiltration of helicopters landing Syrian commando fighters near the base. During the battle between a patrol of the General Staff and the Syrian commando, 40 Syrian fighters were killed. Netanyahu was awarded the Medal of Distinguished Service for how he commanded the battle and other actions he performed in the war.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "War of Faith (Chinese: 追风者; pinyin: Zhuī Fēng Zhě) is a 2024 Chinese spy war revolutionary theme drama directed by Yao Xiaofeng starring Wang Yibo, Li Qin, and Wang Yang. War of Faith is iQiyi's first drama to reach over 10,000 hits in 2024 and it is one of the most influential spy dramas in recent years.  This drama does not focus too much on spy warfare, but more on the establishment of the protagonist's faith.  It tells the story of Wei Ruolai (played by Wang Yibo), a patriotic young man in the 1930s who witnessed the darkness of society, gradually found his life direction, and finally joined the historical torrent of the new revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nSet in 1930s Shanghai, the series tells the story of Wei Ruolai, a math genius from a small poor village, who became an ordinary employee of the Kuomintang Central Bank.  He gradually gained the appreciation of senior adviser Shen Tunan (played by Wang Yang) for his outstanding workability and was accepted as a disciple. In the process, Wei Ruolai saw a lot of corruption and darkness in the Kuomintang's financial field and got pulled into the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Guided by Shen Tunan's sister, Shen Jinzhen (played by Li Qin), who has been working as an underground member of the CCP, different choices made Wei Ruolai and Shen Tunan eventually part ways.  After Wei Ruolai's action to seek justice for the common people and Shen Jinzhen's identity became compromised, both of them escaped from Shanghai to Jiangxi. Under the CCP's leadership, Wei Ruolai participated in the smokeless war to smash the Kuomintang's economic blockade of the Central Soviet Area, and gradually grew into a red financier who was responsible for the party's economic front. \n\n\n== Cast ==\nWang Yibo as Wei Ruolai\nLi Qin as Shen Jinzhen\nWang Yang as Shen Tunan\nZhang Tianyang as Lin Qiaosong\nWang Xueqi as Xu Nuo\nGao Lu as Su Dishu\nYang Kun as Aunt Zhou\nXiya Lan as Niu Chunmiao\nLing Ting as Li Shengda\nZhu Tie as Leiming\nSong Shuia as Huang Congyun\n\n\n== Production ==\nWar of Faith was filmed from January 2023 to May 2023.

        "content": "Joseph (Joe) Croft (c.1925 - 22 August 1996) was a Gurindji and Mudburra man who was a member of the Stolen Generations who spent his early childhood in government institutions and, in 1944, he became the first Aboriginal person to attend an Australian University.Throughout his life he was an Aboriginal activist and advocated for Indigenous rights throughout his life.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nCroft was born at Victoria River Downs Station to Bessie (sometime recorded as Bessy), a Gurindji-Mudburra/Chinese woman, and Joe Croft who was of Irish-Scottish heritage. His father was also known as \"Handsome Joe\" who worked on the station as a cook, gardener and station hand.On 1 July 1927 Tom Hemmings, a Mounted Constable from the Northern Territory Police Force, visited the station and took Bessie and Croft from there to the Myilly Point Home, which was just outside the fence of the nearby to the Kahlin Compound in Darwin; Croft said one of his few memories of this was his mother crying. At this home Croft was able to stay with his mother until 1931, when he was approximately 6 years-old, and he was transferred, along with 27 other boys, to the Pine Creek Home in Pine Creek. Then, when the home closed in 1933, Croft was sent to The Bungalow in Alice Springs; another child who was also transferred was Alec Kruger.While at The Bungalow Croft did well in his classes and received high marks in the 1939 qualifying certificate examinations and in 1940, with the support of Father Percy Smith and his teacher Wally Boehm, won a government scholarship to attend All Souls' School in Charters Towers. This was the first time that students from The Bungalow had been able to sit for these examinations and the scholarship was one of only two offered to Northern Territory students and, at that time the Northern Territory had no secondary schools of its own; Tony Austin (2000) said this was \"no doubt to the dismay of white residents [of Alice Springs]\". At All Souls' Croft was the first Aboriginal student and during his final year in 1943 he was school captain as well as being captain of the football, cricket and swimming teams.After the completion of his schooling Croft received a Commonwealth bursary to attend the University of Queensland in 1944 where he enrolled in an engineering degree and, as the first Aboriginal student this received national press coverage. Croft was inspired to study engineering by childhood memories at Pine Creek watching the trains go by. Despite this, he felt unsettled at university, in the midst of World War II, and said of it:\nI had this feeling that I wanted to be out there, defending the country, my country. So, I didn't do my studies that year, I played a lot of sport … [and] when the results came out I didn't do too good, so I joined the army.\nOn 3 March 1945, at Townsville, Croft enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force and completed infantry training and was appointed lance corporal a month before the war ended. He was discharged on 30 September 1946 and returned to university in 1947 but left soon after without completing his degree. He then worked in various jobs, including cane cutting, until 1950.From 1950 to 1971 he became a contracting surveyor, using skills that drew from his engineering studies, on dam building and railway line rebuilding projects. In 1959 when working of the Snowy Mountains Scheme he met Dorothy Jean Stone whom he would later marry on 9 June 1962. Soon after their marriage they moved to Perth together as Croft had been appointed a surveyor on the Perth-Kalgoorlie railway and their first two children, Brenda (1964) and Lindsay (1967), were born there and their third child Timothy (1971) was born in Lismore.For many years Croft had been working under the assumption that his mother, Bessie had died, as he had ceased receiving letters from her in 1940, when he had left The Bungalow. He had not been told that she had been evacuated from Darwin following the bombing of Darwin and had no longer been able to contact him. However, when his family again moved to the Northern Rivers region in 1968 and, when needing a copy of his birth certificate to apply for a loan, he wrote to Harry Giese, the then Director of Welfare in the Northern Territory, and found that his mother was alive and was working as a laundress at the Retta Dixon Home. Croft was also told that he had a number of siblings. After the finding out that his mother was alive Croft was able to begin a correspondence with his her via Amelia Shankelton; a missionary there.In 1972 the family purchased a newsagency at Woodburn and, during this time, Croft worked closely with the Bundjalung people living at Cabbage Tree Island and helped establish an arts and craft business. He would sell these works, and other works from the Northern Territory, at the newsagency. In 1972 Dorothy won second prize in a Mother's Day writing competition for New Idea in which she told Croft's story of being separated from his mother; her prize for this competition win was a telephone call which allowed Croft to speak to Bessie for the first time in 30 years. Soon after, in early in 1974, they were able to visit her for the first time and spent three weeks staying with her; she passed away in December that year.In 1975 Croft began working for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in Canberra as a liaison officer and later began working for the Aboriginal Development Commission. In the late-1970s he was seconded to serve on the Anti-Discrimination Board of NSW here he worked with Al Grassby. In this role he travelled extensively to assess cases and worked closely with Aboriginal communities and individuals throughout Australia. A series of other roles in the public sector followed, including as the treasurer of the ACT Koories Club (later known as the Aboriginal Corporation for Sporting and Recreational Activities), which was chaired by his friend and fellow former Bungalow resident Charles Perkins.Croft maintained his interest in Indigenous Australian art and organised exhibitions at venues around Canberra, including an exhibition of work from Maningrida at the Canberra School of Art in July 1983. He also toured nationally and internationally with the Ramingining dance group, including David Gulpilil and Bobby Bunungurr in the mid-1980s.\nCroft retired from the public service in June 1988, relocated to Sydney, and continued his work in the art sector. He said of this:\nArt and culture is what it all means [to be Aboriginal], I feel please to be helping Aboriginal people at grass-roots level by showing Australian's something of the art and culture of my people.Croft and Dorothy divorced in 1991 and, in April 1992 he married Patricia and moved to Springwood. Later, following a significant injury  for which he had to remain in hospital for over a year, he entered aged care and died of Leukemia on 22 July 1996. He was buried at the Kalkarindji cemetery.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nA portrait of Croft, alongside his daughter Brenda L Croft is held by the National Portrait Gallery (Australia).\nThe Joseph (Joe) Croft Indigenous Award was established in 2015 at St John's Collage at the University of Queensland to support Indigenous students.\nThe Joseph and Lindsay Croft memorial scholarship at the Australian National University; this scholarship also honours his son Lindsay who was killed in a car accident on 3 August 1996.\nJoe Croft Street in Bonner, Australian Capital Territory is named for him.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sandy White Hawk \"Chokta Najinn Winyan\" is a Sicangu Lakota adoptee from the Rosebud Reservation, South Dakota. She is a writer, a speaker, and an activist. She is the founder and executive director of First Nations Repatriation Institute, the Elder in Residence at the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition in Minneapolis, Minnesota, she formed the First Nations Orphans Association, and she was named the 2017 Champion for Native Children by the National Indian Child Welfare Association\n\n\n== Early life ==\nWhite Hawk talked openly in an article section titled, \"A History Of Removal,\" referring to a time when Native people were taken from their birth families and put into boarding schools. “I cannot imagine the entitlement the social worker must have felt to walk into a family and just take a child,” she shared, adding, “I cannot imagine how emasculating it must have been for our men to watch that happen, and not be able to do anything [for fear of arrest]. My uncle remembers the social worker driving into our driveway, getting out of the car and taking me.”\nAs a child, White Hawk was adopted from the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota to non-Native Wisconsin parents. In her book \"A Child Of The Indian Race,\" she described in vivid detail the experience of being torn from her birth parents, and being put into a red pickup truck. The title of the book came from her adoption papers, and how they listed her as \"a child of the Indian race.\" White Hawk was adopted into a white family and an early age. In 1988, she returned home to the Rosebud Sioux Reservation in South Dakota, and to her people, the Sicangu Lakota.\nWhite Hawk shared, “When I first went home, my family actually said to me, ‘welcome home.’ My uncles sat me down and told me who I am.” \n\n\n== First Nations Orphans Association ==\nJust prior to chapter 9 of Sandy White Hawk's book \"A Child Of The Indian Race: A Story Of Return,\" she shares a story of the day she was given her Lakota name, Chokta Najinn Winyan (Stands in the Center Woman). There are many mentions of Chris Leith of Prairie Island Dakota. He was a well respected man, who had earned the right to wear a headdress, something only for those with great honor can wear. In this book he had been described as a great friend, who also advised on matters of the spirit. She shared with Chris, a vision she had. One where she saw fostered and adopted adults would be welcomed home with a song.\nIn this story, White Hawk writes about her idea for organizing a Welcome Home Powow for adoptees, and how her visions, friendships with spiritual guidance were the essential building blocks to forming the First Nations Orphans Association.\n\n\n== First Nations Repatriation Institute ==\nThe primary objective of the First Nations Repatriation Institute (FNRI) is to provide a support system for First Nations individuals affected by foster care or adoption. FNRI aims to assist them in returning home, rediscovering their roots, and reclaiming their cultural identity. Additionally, the Institute strives to enhance the abilities and expertise of practitioners who work with First Nations people.\nWhite Hawk has dedicated herself to promoting healing and reconciliation within her community. She achieves this by organizing forums that bring together adoptees, fostered individuals, and their families, along with professionals. These forums aim to identify post-adoption issues and devise effective strategies to prevent the removal of First Nations children. Additionally, Sandra has initiated a support group for adoptees and birth relatives in the Twin Cities Area, providing ongoing support and resources to those who need it.\n\n\n== Legal Rights Center of Minneapolis ==\nWhite Hawk serves on the board of directors for the Legal Rights Center of Minneapolis, whose mission is \"to work with our communities to seek justice and promote racial equity for those to whom it has been historically denied.' The LRC was founded in 1970, by the efforts of Syl Davis (Northside Black community activist), Clyde Bellecourt (American Indian Movement), Doug Hall, and with assitance from  Peter Dorsey.\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, the Public Defender's Office was unable to cater to the needs of low-income communities and communities of color effectively. As a result, there was a growing desire for a law firm that could serve these communities as an alternative. This was due to the public defender's office being overburdened and not held accountable for protecting the needs of its clients in many ways.\n\n\n== Association for American Indian Affairs ==\nThe Association on American Indian Affairs has served Native Country as a non-profit organization since 1922. The Association's primary objectives are protecting sovereignty, preserving culture, educating youth, and building capacity. It was established to steer federal policy away from assimilation, termination, and allotment towards self-determination, self-sufficiency, and sovereignty. With over 100 years of history, the Association has been advocating for national issues that support culture and sovereignty while also working closely with Tribes at the grassroots level to help implement programs that have a direct impact on people's lives.\nThe Association is led by a Board of Directors comprising of Native Americans from different parts of the country, including Sandy White Hawk. As a membership organization, the Association speaks with a collective voice of Native and non-Native members to safeguard sovereignty, protect cultural heritage, promote education among the youth, and enhance the community's capacity.\nThe organization launched a podcast series named \"Red Hoop Talk\". The podcast features various special guests, panels, and open talking circles to discuss the ways in which Native individuals strive to preserve their culture and promote \"self-determination and sovereignty for Native Country.\" White Hawk was one of 4 guests in an episode of Red Hoop Talk's \"favorite women\" for Women's History Month.\n\n\n== Truth And Reconciliation Commission work ==\nCommissioner for the Maine Wabanaki State Child Welfare Truth and Reconciliation Commission.\nHonorary Witness of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on Residential Schools in Canada.\n\n\n== Cited in studies ==\nSandy White Hawk has been cited in numerous studies focusing on the reunification of American Indian families and the experiences adopted and fostered individuals where victimization  had played a significant role in the prediction of reunification. She was cited a study exploring the differences in the social connection to tribe and tribal enrollment of American Indian fostered and adopted adults in 2018 in Children and Youth Services Review. The study showed that reunified participants were 8 times more likely to be enrolled\nIn February 2024, the academic journal, Child Abuse & Neglect, published a study titled \"Longing to belong: The ambiguous loss of Indigenous fostered/adopted individuals.\" Indigenous Elder, White Hawk guided the study and contributed her expertise and experience to the project. She conceptualized the idea for the study, having spent many years facilitating adoptee support groups and welcoming home ceremonies in the Indigenous community. She also played a key role in developing the open-ended questions analyzed in this study and in collecting the original data.\nAlso in 2024, The Experiences of Adopted and Fostered Individuals Project conducted an analysis of data collected from 70 Indigenous individuals who had been fostered or adopted and went through reunification during their adulthood. To examine the experience of reunification, researchers employed inductive thematic analysis on the open-ended survey data provided by the participants. The study and its findings were published in volume 148 of Child Abuse & Neglect. White Hawk and her organization, FNRI were cited.\nIn 2021, in an earlier edition of the same academic journal, White Hawk and the First Nations Repatriation Institute (FNRI) were cited in \"Abuse after abuse: The recurrent maltreatment of American Indian children in foster care and adoption,\" where some findings published highlighted that American Indian children were \"more likely to report physical maltreatment, sexual maltreatment, and spiritual maltreatment recurrence.\"\nin 2015, An article from the journal, First Peoples Child & Family Review, first published \"Finding their way home: The reunification of First Nations adoptees.\" The FNRI and White Hawk were cited   in this study to help explain that First Nation adoptees have more than a biological or birth family to return to, but also ancestral land and a tribe. According to adoptees, establishing a strong connection with their extended family and community plays a significant role in improving the experience of reunification.\n\n\n== Speaking engagements and training ==\nWhite Hawk has been on panels and has spoken a numerous conferences across the United States. She continues to tell her story and advocate for others. In November 2023, she was the Keynote speaker at Washington State's Fourth Annual Indigenous Children Youth and Family Conference.\n\n\n=== Tribal Training and Certification Partnership (TTCP) ===\nWhite Hawk is a consultant and community trainer for the Tribal Training Certification Partnership for the University of Minnesota Duluth (UMD). The Tribal Training and Certification Partnership offers training and certification programs to Minnesota's child welfare workforce regarding the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) and Minnesota Indian Family Preservation Act (MIFPA). ICWA is a federal law that mandates the involvement of American Indian children in specific cases. MIFPA is Minnesota's version of ICWA, which offers enhanced protection to American Indian children, families, and tribal nations. All social workers must possess adequate knowledge of MIFPA, a state law that is applicable to ICWA cases, to ensure its proper application. \n\n\n== See also ==\nDyani White Hawk, Sandy White's artist daughter\nClyde Bellecourt (American Indian Movement)\n\n\n== External Links ==\nThe National Native American Boarding School Coalition\nFirst Nations Reparation Institute\nMinnesota Indian Family Preservation Act (MIFPA)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Tenejapa-Lacandón Formation is a geological formation and lagerstätte in southern Mexico and western Guatemala. It preserves fossils dating to the Early Paleocene. \nIt is located primarily in the Mexican state of Chiapas, but outcrops lie as far west as Petén, Guatemala. Under some definitions, it is composed of two distinct formations: the Tenejapa Formation to the west and the Lacandón Formation to the east, with them together composing the Tenejapa-Lacandón Unit. However, these two formations are contiguous and contemporary with each other, so they are often mapped together as a single geologic formation. The Lacandón Formation was deposited in a shallow inshore marine habitat, whereas the Tenejapa Formation was deposited in a deep offshore habitat. They appear to preserve a marine ecosystem deposited on the western margin of the Caribbean Sea.\nThe most prominent exposures are at the División del Norte and Belisario Domínguez quarries near Palenque, Chiapas, which contain articulated fish skeletons belonging to a variety of taxa of both Cenozoic and Mesozoic affinities. This formation was also the source of the limestone used to build the ancient Mayan city of Palenque, with one other fossil-bearing locality being an unnamed quarry used by the Mayans. The inhabitants of ancient Palenque were aware of the fossils present in the formation, and used them in ways such as painting articulated fossils for the purpose of decoration.\nThe Tenejapa-Lacandón Formation is, temporally and geographically, the \"closest\" geological formation to the Chicxulub impact and the resulting crater; it is located only 500 kilometres (310 mi) from the Chixculub crater and was deposited approximately only 3 million years after the impact. For this reason, it is an important formation for understanding the recovery of ocean ecosystems in the wake of the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event, especially near the Chixculub crater. The high number of well-preserved fossil fish specimens, likely relating to mass mortality events, makes it a lagerstätte. It represents one of the richest known faunas of articulated Paleocene acanthomorphs.\n\n\n== Paleofauna ==\n\n\n=== Fishes ===\n\n\n=== Reptiles ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Henry Graham Ashmead (June 30, 1838 – November 27, 1920) was an American historian, journalist, and chronicler of Delaware County, Pennsylvania. Ashmead's History of Delaware County, Pennsylvania (1884) is one of the classic texts of southeastern Pennsylvania history.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nAshmead was born in Philadelphia on June 30, 1838. His parents were John Wayne Ashmead, a successful lawyer who served as the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and Henrietta Graham Flower. His maternal great-grandfather and namesake, Henry Hale Graham, was the first presiding judge of the Delaware County Courts of Common Pleas. Both his parents were of English descent. Ashmead attended West Chester Academy in West Chester, Pennsylvania, and Saunders' Institute in West Philadelphia. As a boy, he met Edgar Allan Poe, and as a young man, he was a friend of Frank R. Stockton, who named a character in his Christmas story \"Major Pendallas\" after Ashmead.\nAshmead read law in his father's New York office and gained admittance to the New York bar on November 29, 1859. He practiced law briefly alongside classmate Leon Abbett, a future governor of New Jersey, but abandoned his legal career because of ill health, on the advice of his physicians. Ashmead later \"embarked in outdoor uncongenial occupations in which he was unsuccessful.\" After his father died in 1868, Ashmead accompanied his mother to her hometown of Chester, Pennsylvania, where he embarked on a career in journalism and public history. He worked as a reporter and editor for the Chester Daily News and later the Delaware County Republican. In 1882, he became secretary of the Pennsylvania Bi-Centennial Association of Chester. In 1885, President Grover Cleveland appointed him to the office of postmaster of Chester.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAshmead married Rebecca Frances Warner in 1872. Their son, John Wayne Ashmead, died at age 18. After his first wife's death, he married to Emma Campbell in 1881. Ashmead died in Chester on November 27, 1920, at the age of 82. He was interred at Chester Rural Cemetery.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nAshmead authored several books and articles on the history of Delaware County. The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography predicted that Ashmead's Historical Sketch of Chester \"will prove of great value to the genealogist and antiquarian.\" He also wrote several minor stage plays.\n\nGilbert, Cope; Ashmead, Henry Graham, eds.

        "content": "Frank Croxton (7 October 1877 – 4 September 1949) was an American bass and voice teacher. A New York City based vocalist, he had a career as a church singer in that city, and was also active on both the local and national stage as a concert singer. He is best remembered for his prolific work as a recording artist during the 1900s, 1910s, and 1920s; making a large number of records extending from the first era of sound recording, the acoustic era, into the second era, the electrical era. He performed and recorded as both a soloist and as an ensemble singer; notably working as a member of several different nationally known vocal quartets, among them the Peerless Quartet, the Stellar Quartette, and his own Croxton Quartet. He made records with the Victor Talking Machine Company, Columbia Records, Okeh Records, and Edison Records. Four hundred and forty-five of his recordings have been catalogued in the Discography of American Historical Recordings.\n\n\n== Early life in Kentucky ==\nBorn Benjamin Franklin Croxton in Paris, Kentucky on 7 October 1877, Frank Croxton was the son of Charles \"Chester\" F. Croxton and Mary Croxton (née Anderson). He had two brothers, Richard \"Dick\" Croxton and Charles Croxton. At the age of five he moved with his family to Lexington, Kentucky. The family's house in Lexington was located near the corner of North Broadway and Sixth Street. He was educated at Fayette County Public Schools and sang with his brother Richard in a vocal quartet at the district's commencement in 1894. \nFrank's father was a talented bass, who was employed as a church singer at Christ Church Cathedral in Lexington, Kentucky in the 1880s. His father eventually became the music director of the choir at that church, and also served in that capacity at First United Methodist Church of Lexington.\nHe also worked as a choral director and voice teacher for the Kentucky Chautauqua Assembly, and was head of the music department of Fayette County Public Schools in Lexington. \nFrank grew up listening to his dad sing songs from the classic bass vocal literature, and received his initial vocal instruction from his father. The two of them sang together at the ceremony unveiling a new monument to Roger Hanson, a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War, at the Lexington Cemetery in July 1895. They performed a well known Confederate funeral elegy of the Orphan Brigade by John Henry Weller (1842-1912) entitlted \"O Lay, Me Away With Boys in Gray\".\n\n\n== Formal voice training and early career ==\nCroxton briefly studied at Transylvania University in Lexington prior to pursuing training as a singer in New York. In September 1895, at the age of 18, he left Kentucky for New York City where he was engaged as a paid church singer at Calvary Baptist Church in Manhattan while simultaneaously studying at the New York Vocal Institute under voice teacher Frank Herbert Tubbs. He gave a concert along with other students of that school at the Park Hill Country Club in Yonkers, New York in December 1895. In November 1896 he took a position as a paid singer at First United Methodist Church in Mount Vernon, New York while continuing to study with Tubbs.\nOn August 26, 1897 Frank Croxton married Elsie Hamilton at the home of the bride's parents in Brooksville, Kentucky. The pair had met three years previously while singing with the Kentucky Chautauqua Assembly. After the wedding the couple settled in New York City where Croxton resumed work as a church singer. In 1898 Croxton joined the opera company of Camille D'Arville and toured with that company in Reginald De Koven's The Highwayman. He was working as a church vocalist at St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church in Manhattan when he relocated to Indianapolis in the Spring of 1899 to join the roster of singers at Fourth Presbyterian Church in Indianapolis.\n\n\n== Later life and career ==\nCroxton became a bass soloist employed at Brick Presbyterian Church in Manhattan. One of his fellow professional singers at that church was soprano Agnes Kimball. When Croxton formed a professional vocal quartet, the Croxton Quartet, Kimball was the soprano in the group. The quartet's other vocalists were tenor Reed Miller and his wife, contralto Nevada Van der Veer. This quartet performed in concerts both in New York City and on tour, and made several recordings for a variety of record labels in 1911-1912. \nIn 1914 Croxton was a founding member of Columbia's Stellar Quartette whose other members included John Barnes Wells, Charles Harrison, and Andrea Sarto. He established the Croxton Trio in 1918. In 1919 he became a member of the Peerless Quartet and that same recorded with the Victor Talking Machine Company as a part of \"Eight Famous Victor Artists\" group. He continued to perform and record with the Peerless Quartet until he left that group in 1925. \nWith the onset of the Great Depression, Croxton's recording career ceased. He remained active as a church singer and voice teacher after this. He died in New York City on September 4, 1949.\n\n\n== Recordings ==\nCroxton was a resident recording artist with Columbia Records from 1910-1915. In assessing his voice on record, musicologist Leo Riemens and music biographer Karl-Josef Kutsch in their biography on Kimball in the Großes Sängerlexikon stated that \"Although most of  Croxton's recordings are devoted to musically less valuable works from the field of light music, some arias from oratorios by Handel and Mendelssohn as well as songs show that he had a bass voice that could compete with many famous bassists of his era.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Hexaemeron of Jacob of Edessa (d. 708) is Jacob's commentary on the six days of creation of the Genesis creation narrative. Jacob worked on it in the first few years of the eighth century, as it was his final work. Unable to complete it within his own lifetime, the work was finished by his friend George, Bishop of the Arabs (d. 724). It is an example of a work in the genre of Hexaemeral literature, but should not be confused with a similar earlier work, namely the Hexaemeron by Jacob of Serugh. \n\n\n== Context ==\nJacob of Edessa wrote several other commentaries (though his Hexaemeron's attempt to incorporate large amounts of scientific and philosophical knowledge have led some to question whether it is aptly called a 'commentary) including others that covered Genesis, such as his Commentary on the Octateuch. Jacob followed Basil of Caesarea in the tradition of the Antiochene school of exegesis, including Basil's own Hexaemeron, whose exegetical similarities with Jacob's work have been studied. In addition, it has been shown that Jacob made extensive use of Aristotle's theory of the four elements. Some have speculated that the work may be further contextualized into Jacob's wish to reassert the role of the Christian God in the creation of the cosmos and the reliability of the Genesis creation narrative in light of the Arab conquests.\nThe sources for Jacob's biblical citations are composed of a mixture stemming from the Septuagint, the Peshitta, and the Syro-Hexaplar version. Though Jacob had also completed a translation of the Bible by 705, his biblical citation were not made by copying over from it. The Peshitta (Syriac translation of the Bible) was the primary one, although there is evidence for his use of a Greek-language and, to a lesser extent, the Syro-Hexapla. Some uses of the text also reflect Jacob's own editorial or stylistic choice or his working from memory of the text.\n\n\n== Content ==\nOne point of dispute that Jacob discussed was that of the upper waters described in Genesis. Influenced by Hellenistic philosophy, Christians such as Origen and Gregory of Nyssa rejected the traditional belief in a physical body of water above the firmament, and instead reinterpreted the upper waters as the noetic world according to a Platonic cosmological scheme. However, both he and Basil of Caesarea returned to and reaffirmed a belief in the literal waters. Jacob, however, sought to reconcile this with Aristotle's view of concentric circles, which asserted that the further out one goes, the lighter the elements that they encounter, such that water should not be further out than the air. For Basil, this was resolved by pointing to the firmament as a solid body that the waters could rest upon, preventing their descent. Jacob however followed John Philoponus who criticized of Basil's view in his De opificio mundi, and instead posited that the upper waters were in fact a mixture of water and air that were lighter than the compact air that they surrounded. In turn, above the upper waters was posited a lighter substance that was composed of a mixture of fire and air. In this respect, John also believed that terms like \"water\", \"firmament\", and \"heavens\" were ambiguous in the creation narrative and sought to interpret them through meteorological processes: here too Jacob followed John. Likely through the intermediary of Jacob's works, John's ideas came to have a wider influence.\nJacob's detailed analysis of the nature and hierarchy of the succeeding spheres was greatly influenced by the Carmina Arcana of Gregory of Nazianzus. The sun has some similarities to God, insofar as it reaches out into the cosmos, and it symbolizes God's absolute remoteness. Against conventional viewpoints, Jacob posited that the sun (and not Saturn, which was the most distant-planet that humans had known about until the discovery of Uranus in 1781) was the most distant luminary, though he was not the first to do so as this position was also held by Anaxagoras and considered by Ptolemy. Though he went against Ptolemaic cosmology in this respect, he still agreed with the movements of the luminaries that it posited. The cosmos itself symbolizes a higher reality. There are three levels or ranks of beings: God, then angels, then men. The highest of these is the purest, and the lowest is the most base. Jacob discusses the weight and quality of the elements as well as their composition, such as if they are pure or compounded. For example, both the sun and the stars are simple and pure. The moon is compounded (of the four elements) and is the lowest luminary. Whereas the sun is life-giving and transmits light, the stars and the moon both receive light. The stars unlike the sun do not have their own light as they are made of air and not fire. In fact, fire has a superior simplicity and purity than does air. The heaviest of the four elements is earth, which is why it is located in the center of the cosmos. Because lighter objects are located closer towards the center, and the moon is the lowest luminary, the moon is also the heaviest of the luminaries.\nJacob's repositioning of the sun also related to his rejection of astrology. The pre-eminence of the position of the sun corresponded with its control over the movements of the stars. And because the movements of the stars were themselves controlled, the stars in turn were not capable of governing or controlling the affairs of the Earth. The stars were not divine, rational, or anything of the sort. The sun itself does not have its own movement but is controlled ultimately by God. An earlier Syriac author, Jacob of Serugh, also took interest in refuting astrology in his own Hexaemeron.\nJacob wrote extensively on the creation and nature of angels, to the degree that it far exceeded the length dedicated to the subject in other Hexameral works. The sources he engaged with in these conversations in the most detail was the Poemata Arcana by Gregory of Nazianzus, and the Celestial Hierarchy of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite.\n\n\n== Editions and translations ==\nThere are two critical editions of Jacob of Edessa's Hexaemeron, both of which are based on a 9th-century manuscript from Lyon:\n\nChabot, J.B. 1928.

Reminiscent of Persona and Mulholland Drive, the film follows a young woman who defies her own death.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nMortem generally received mixed to negative reviews from critics. The Village Voice stated that \"The initial scenes, thick with creep-show ambiance, promise more fulfilling madness than what actually transpires once the out-of-nowhere second guest reveals who she is.\"  The New York Times compared the film's aesthetic to that of Jean Cocteau, but gave a similarly lukewarm review as The Village Voice, stating that \"Most often Mortem just lacks bite, and the dedicated leads seem at times a little slight for the staging of a struggle at eternity's edge.\"  Time Out New York awarded the film one star out of five and described it as \"excruciatingly bad\".  Slant Magazine gave the film a largely negative review, opining that the film \"too readily abandons its noir framework for the sweeping meta-narrative about desire's link to thanatos, and in so doing, leaves too little room for guesswork.\"  Film Journal International stated that \"This initially bewitching throwback to the French New Wave and Cocteau turns into a turgid and frequently laughable pseudo-philosophical locked-room argument between a woman and her soul.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMortem at IMDb \nMortem at AllMovie\nMortem at Metacritic\nMortem at Rotten Tomatoes",

        "content": "\"Burn You Up, Burn You Down\" is a song co-written and performed by English rock musician Peter Gabriel. Early recording was conducted at Gabriel's Real World Studios in 1991, although the song would remain unreleased for another decade. The song was originally intended to appear on Gabriel's 2002 Up, but was ultimately pulled from the track list shortly before the album's release. It was instead included on Gabriel's Hit compilation album the following year and released as a single, where it charted in both Italy and the UK. An alternate mix of \"Burn You Up, Burn You Down\" was also included on Big Blue Ball in 2008.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe origins of \"Burn You Up, Burn You Down\" date back to the summer of 1991 during the first of three Real World Recording Weeks. The recording sessions took place in the workroom of Real World Studios, with Billy Cobham playing drums. Gabriel commissioned the help of multiple musicians around the world for this project, including western, Asian, and African artists. However, the tapes from these sessions took several years to organize, delaying the release of the song. Members of the The Holmes Brothers were enlisted to record backing vocals; Gabriel commented that one of the members of the group, Popsy Dixon, had \"a hauntingly beautiful voice, and he’d come up with these high notes that hit me hard every time he reached them.\"\n\"Burn You Up, Burn You Down\" was originally slated to appear on Gabriel's Up album in September 2002, although Gabriel pulled the song from the track list during the album's final review sessions. In July 2002, the song was included on a promotional CD for Up as the sixth track on the album.\nIn 2003, the song was used on the soundtrack for Uru: Ages Beyond Myst. That same year, it was the only new song to appear on Gabriel's Hit and also served as the album's lead single.

Documents make note of a church of this name  in Vicopisano by the year 934. The church facade has walled up arches and geometric and floral decorations; while the interior is simple. It has a central nave and two aisles, separated by re-used Ancient Roman columns with Romanesque capitals. The church layout we see today likely dates to the 11th century. The windows are tall and narrow.\nThe main altar has a wooden sculptural group depicting a deposition from the cross, whose dating is attributed to the 13th-century. At one time the wood was painted. Traces of 13th-century frescoes were discovered behind stone side altars that flanked the aisle.\n\n\n== References ==",

This dry noodle concoction actually comes with two bowls – one for you to create the soup base and the other for you to stir and toss the noodles after you've drained the noodles. This type of instant noodles became popular in the Taiwanese market in the 1970s soon after its release on the market.\n\n\n== History ==\nWei Lih Men entered the Taiwanese market in 1973. In the 1970s, the Taiwanese market lacked many consumer goods, so many companies competed to release instant noodle products. This product was special as unlike normal instant noodles, they are not eaten with the soup but served with fried bean sauce, in the form of Taiwanese style Zhajiangmian.\n\n\n== See also ==\n \nList of instant noodle brands\nList of noodles\nImperial Big Meal\nTTL Hua Tiao Chicken Noodles\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Wei Lih Men at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Robot couture by Thierry Mugler is a garment in the world of haute couture, crafted as a futuristic cyborg-inspired metal and perspex catsuit. This garment was first unveiled by the fashion house of Mugler at its 20th anniversary haute couture fashion show in 1995. The late creative director and adviser for Mugler, Thierry Mugler, designed this “Silvery Cyborg Getup,” as described by Vogue Runway, in collaboration with Mr. Pearl, Jean-Jacques Urcun, and Jean-Pierre Delcros. Initially modeled by Nadja Auermann, this garment is inspired by Hajime Sorayama’s erotic robot art and the seminal film Metropolis.\n\n\n== Design and symbolism ==\nAlthough the suit remains unnamed, it was notably described by Vogue runway as “Silvery Cyborg Getup” and has been deemed “Fembot Suit” and “Robot Couture,” along with a slew of other names by other sources. Designed by the late Thierry Mugler, the metal and perspex catsuit was unveiled at Mugler’s fall/winter 1995 collection show at the Cirque d’Hiver in France,. This intricate and unique garment was designed in collaboration with three renowned craftsmen: corsetiere Mr. Pearl, artist Jean-Jacques Urcun, and aircraft specialist Jean-Pierre Delcros. On the runway, this design’s debut was marked as German supermodel Nadja Auermann performed a striptease where she shed a juxtaposing purple floor-length coat along with a sheer black cover-up, revealing the articulated metal jumpsuit. \nRobot Couture was created with dual inspiration from Maria, also referred to as  Maschinenmensch, from the novel turned film Metropolis and the sleek, erotic robots characteristic of Japanese illustrator Hajime Sorayama. Overall, this garment stands as a feminist symbol of allure and strength. Featuring strategic and striking perspex cutouts highlighting commonly idealized parts of the female body such as the buttocks, boobs, and face, Mugler melds the ridgid robotic armor with the inherent fluidity of the female form to allude to ideas of the perfect plastic female form as a weapon. This idea is in the same realm as the work of Hajime Sorayama, as the opaque and glistening metal acts as a barrier to desire while the perspex cutouts act to highlight the unattainable beauty standards women are subjected to in erotic media like porn. This idea isn’t new to Mugler, as he often makes garments that reflect feminist ideals, such as women as warriors. The cutouts also stand to represent the intermixing of robotics and human forms, as his reference to Metropolis and Hajime Sorayama would imply; however, Mugler twists this idea by visually creating a definition between the two forms. This definition, by way of differential material usage, metal and perspex, provides a commentary on the fragmentation of female forms and the commodification of both the female and robotic body. The design eye-catchingly explores the interaction between humans and technology and reflects narratives around the intermixing of both organic and synthetic realms.\n\n\n== Historical and cultural context ==\nThe debut of Robot Couture came during a time when society was deeply engaged in discussions about the integration of human life and technology, fueled by the many technological advances of the early 1990s such as the World Wide Web, smartphone, and webcam. The 1990s saw a boom in fascination with cyborgs and AI, echoing fears and fantasies around the blurring of the boundary between humans and machines. With ties to Donna Haraway’s “A Cyborg Manifesto,” which challenges distinctions between humans and technology, Robot Couture taps into these themes and ideas. With this garment, the body acts as a vessel for socio-political commentary and artistic expression.\n\n\n== Reception and influence ==\nThe 1995 show, featuring Robot Couture, received critical acclaim as it was said to be one of the most unforgettable shows of the 1990s. More specifically, it was celebrated for its contemporary approach and theatricality of presentation, both of the garments and show, with guest star James Brown and Mugler’s eccentric modeling style. Robot Couture specifically received praise and has gone on to have a lasting impact on the fashion industry. A multitude of designers, namely Alexander McQueen and Dolce & Gabbana, have taken inspiration from this garment while exploring themes of technology and futurism in their work. \n\n\n== Legacy ==\nRobot Couture continues to be held in high regard today, as it is still seen as a pivotal work that encapsulates the futuristic aesthetics of the 90s while still resonating with present themes in contemporary fashion. This garment has remained archived for a majority of the time since its photoshoot with world-renowned photographer Helmut Newton shortly after its debut in 1995. However, in 2010, this garment was spotted on the cover of the February edition of Vogue Germany\n\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n\n== References ==",

He had to be given mouth-to-mouth on the pitch by the Newport club doctor due to breathing difficulties and went to hospital with concussion.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Wales national rugby union players\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGordon Britton at ESPNscrum",

Saponara described the track as \"seven minutes of smooth raps\".\nWriting for Clash, Robin Murray wrote that the track is \"one of the best\" on the album and that the track has a \"breezy West Coast feel\" accompanied by \"Cole’s introspection offering something distinctive\". Sputnikmusic's Dakota West Foss compared the beat to NyQuil, suggesting that it's boring and stated that Cole's verse matches the beat.

        "content": "\"We Still Don't Trust You\" is a song by American rapper Future, American record producer Metro Boomin, and Canadian singer the Weeknd. It was sent to Italian radio airplay through Freebandz, Boominati Worldwide, Epic Records, and Republic Records as the lead single from Future and Metro's \ncollaborative studio album of the same name on April 19, 2024. Its official music video was released six days earlier, which was a day after its parent album was released, and stars Canadian fashion model Winnie Harlow.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nMichael Saponara of Billboard ranked \"We Still Don't Trust You\" as the best song on the album of the same name. Saponara noted that the track contains \"soft drums and a beeping noise that sounds like an EKG heart monitor set the stage of what's to come on this blockbuster with Future repeating the intro title before The Weeknd's ominous croon invades the premises\".\nSputnikmusic's Dakota West Foss compared the sound of the song to that of the Weeknd's fifth studio album, Dawn FM (2022), rather than \"something that plays to the image of the project's main duo, and that is genuinely a compliment\".\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

A total of 22 athletes (9 boys and 13 girls) competed in the events. Athletes had to be born between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2008 to be eligible (ages 16 to 19).\n\n\n== Participating nations ==\nA total of 4 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) registered athletes for the basque pelota competitions.
