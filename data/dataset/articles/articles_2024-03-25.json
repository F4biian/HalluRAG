        "content": "Luis María de Uribe Echevarría (17 October 1906 – 18 November 1994), nicknamed Volea, was a Spanish footballer who played as a forward for Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao. He was a member of the great Bilbao side under Fred Pentland that won two league titles and three Copa del Rey titles in the early 1930s.\nHe is the father of former Athletic Bilbao footballer Ignacio Uribe.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\n\n\n=== Real Madrid ===\nUribe was born on 17 October 1906 in Urduliz, Biscay. When he finished high school he moved to Madrid in 1924, at the age of 18, to study medicine; he settled in a boarding house. Whilst in the capital, he joined the ranks of Sociedad Gimnástica before being signed by Real Madrid. He was a pure amateur and coincided with the arrival of the first professional that Madrid had: José María Peña. In the quarterfinals of the 1927 Copa del Rey, he scored once in a 4–1 victory over CE Europa, but the team lost in the semifinals to Real Unión.\nIn total, he scored 60 goals in just 57 competitive matches, including 24 goals in 26 cup matches between 1926 and 1929. He left Madrid in 1929, the same year in which the national first division was founded, with Uribe playing only one such match with the white team, on 16 June 1929 in a 2–0 victory against Arenas Club de Getxo.\n\n\n=== Athletic Bilbao ===\nOnce he finished his studies in 1929, Uribe returned to the Basque Country, where he joined the ranks of Fred Pentland's Athletic Bilbao. He was a member of the squad that won two league titles and three Copa del Rey titles between 1930 and 1934 under Pentland; however, he did not play a major role in these triumphs due to the presence of other talented forwards considered among the best in the club's history (Lafuente, José Iraragorri, Chirri II, Bata and Guillermo Gorostiza). In his first year, for example, he only played two matches in the regional championship, without participating in the league or the cup. Despite not being a prominent regular, he got to start (as a midfielder) in the 1932 final, helping his side to a 1–0 victory over FC Barcelona.\nAccording to his son, Uribe \"was a bit of the team's wild card when one of the starters was missing\", and when given the opportunity he often demonstrated his qualities and his shooting power. For instance, on 14 December 1930, he made his La Liga debut with the Bilbao team, scoring twice in the Basque derby against Real Sociedad to help his side to a 6–1 win. In total, he scored 26 goals in just 43 games, including a hat-trick in his last League game, on 12 November 1933, against Real Betis.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nReal Madrid\n\nCampeonato Regional Centro: 1927, 1929\nAthletic Club\n\nLa Liga: 1930–31, 1933–34\nCopa del Rey: 1931, 1932, 1933\nBiscay Championship: 1931, 1932, 1933, 1934\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Carrie B. Raymond (née, Rice; 1857–1927) was an American musician and educator. For 34 years, she directed the University of Nebraska–Lincoln chorus.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nCarrie Isabelle Rice was born in South Valley, New York, July 12, 1857. Her parents removed to Iowa when she was young.\nHer love of music displayed itself very early in life, and she was happy in practicing her music. At the age of 10, she was sufficiently far advanced to play the cabinet organ in church, having had the benefit of such instruction as the small town afforded. At the age of 14, she began to play on the pipe-organ. Her progress and the real talent she displayed warranted the desire for better instruction than the region then afforded. She went to Brooklyn, New York, and placed herself under the instruction of Professor Lasar. While with him, she paid particular attention to the piano and organ.\n\n\n== Career ==\nShe began her career in Washington, D.C. as a teacher and organist, in both of which she was successful. Very few women of the time could manipulate an organ with the ease and skill demonstrated by Raymond.\nIn 1877, she married Peter Voorhis Miller Raymond (1847–1910).\nIn 1885, they settled in Lincoln, Nebraska. Soon after that, she brought together a small company of musicians for the purpose of doing chorus work. Though she encountered many obstacles, by perseverance and ability as a musical director, she overcame them. At length, her chorus was considered one of the best drilled in the Western states.\nIn 1887, she organized an annual musical festival, during which some of the great masterpieces were to be performed. Among those given were Handel's Messiah and Judas Maccabaeus, Haydn's The Creation and Spring, Mendelssohn's Elijah and Lobgesang, Spohr's Last Judgment, Gaul's Holy City, Gounod's Messe solennelle, and Gade's Crusaders. She was in the habit of drilling and preparing the chorus for the festivals and then handing over the baton to an imported director, but in May 1891, the members of the chorus prevailed upon her to conduct the music in the festival. The works given on that occasion were Haydn's Creation, with full chorus and orchestra, and Gade's Crusaders. The performance was a success. That was undoubtedly the first instance in the history of music where a woman filled that position in the rendition of an oratorio.\nIn the December following, she conducted Mendelssohn's Lobgesang with marked success. In May 1892, the Messiah, Cowen's Sleeping Beauty and a miscellaneous concert were given. The work of the orchestra in those concerts was especially commented upon. An attractive feature of the miscellaneous programmes was a chorus of 150 women, which was under the complete control of Raymond. In July 1892, she was director of music in the Crete, Nebraska, Chautauqua Assembly, during which a number of successful concerts were given.\nIn 1894, she became Instructor in Sight Reading University Chorus Classes at University of Nebraska–Lincoln. Till her death in 1927, she directed the university's choruses, staging oratorios, bringing artists to Lincoln, and taking part in the city's musical life. the university commencement programs and countless number of music festivals were under her active leadership. Some of the leading symphony orchestras of the U.S., brought to Lincoln for these events, played under Raymond's baton. She prepared a number of musical programs for the Nebraska State Teachers Association\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n1924, Kiwanis Medal in Recognition of Distinguished Service\n1931, Carillon Tower, First Plymouth Congregational Church, dedicated to Raymond\n1932, Raymond Hall, University of Nebraska\n\n\n== Death ==\nCarrie B. Raymond died of heart disease at Lincoln, Nebraska, October 3, 1927.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Works related to Woman of the Century/Carrie Isabelle Rice Raymond at Wikisource\nCarrie Belle Raymond via Archives of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln\nCarrie Belle Raymond, by  Robt.

This ceremony was also the introduction of the \"ACE Golden Eddie Filmmaker of the Year Award\" award, which was won by Acadaemy-winning director and former editor Robert Wise.

Tzoonie Mountain is more notable for its rise above local terrain than for its absolute elevation as topographic relief is significant with the summit rising over 1,820 metres (5,970 ft) above the Tzoonie River in three kilometres (1.9 mi). The mountain is named in association with the Tzoonie River and the mountain's toponym was officially adopted on May 2, 1955, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. The indigenous word \"Tzoonie\" may be a variation of Ts’únay (or Tsonai), the name for a Sechelt people, whose members were based at Deserted Bay on Jervis Inlet.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nBased on the Köppen climate classification, Tzoonie Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Winter temperatures can drop below −10 °C with wind chill factors below −20 °C. This climate supports an unnamed glacier on the north slope of the peak. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Tzoonie Mountain.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGeography of British Columbia\nGeology of British Columbia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWeather: Tzoonie Mountain",

He was born at Thornton, Yorkshire, according to the Oxford matriculation register, about 1571, although, according to the age assigned him at his death, the date would be 1564. He entered Oriel College, Oxford 23 February 1587–8, at the age of seventeen (Foster, Alumni Oxon. 1500–1714, p. 918), graduated B.A. 5 Feb. 1590–1, became a fellow of his college, and proceeded M.A. 2 July 1595. He graduated M.D. at Basle and was incorporated at Oxford 15 May 1605, and in 1608 at Cambridge. He was elected a fellow of the College of Physicians of London 5 June 1607, was censor in 1608, and one of the elects 10 May 1625. On 4 October 1614 he was sent with Sir William Paddy to represent to the lord mayor, Sir Thomas Middleton, that the city had no right to command the fellows of the college to bear arms, and succeeded in establishing this immunity. He was appointed physician to Anne, queen of James I, and to Charles I, by whom he was knighted at Oatlands, Surrey, 11 October 1636. He retired to Burwell, Lincolnshire, and there died 14 December 1656.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Henderson, Thomas Finlayson (1886). \"Blackadder, William\".

        "content": "Tadalafil, sold under the brand name Cialis among others, is a medication used to treat erectile dysfunction, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. It is taken by mouth. Onset is typically within half an hour and the duration is up to 36 hours.\nCommon side effects include headache, muscle pain, flushed skin, and nausea. Caution is advised in those with cardiovascular disease. Rare but serious side effects include a prolonged erection that can lead to damage to the penis, vision problems, and hearing loss. Tadalafil is not recommended in people taking nitrovasodilators such as nitroglycerin, as this may result in a serious drop in blood pressure. Tadalafil is a PDE5 inhibitor which increases blood flow to the penis. It also dilates blood vessels in the lungs, which lowers the pulmonary artery pressure.\nTadalafil was approved for medical use in the United States in 2003. It is available as a generic medication. In 2021, it was the 171st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions.\n\n\n== Medical uses ==\n\nTadalafil is used to treat erectile dysfunction, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. In the US, tadalafil (as Cialis) is indicated for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia; and (as Adcirca) for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension to improve exercise ability.\n\n\n=== Benign prostatic hypertrophy ===\nA meta‐analysis found that tadalafil is an effective treatment for lower urinary tract symptoms due to prostatic hyperplasia and that such treatment had a low rate of adverse effects. Tadalafil is FDA-approved for males as a therapy to treat and prevent symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, such as urinary urgency, hesitancy, weak stream, dribbling, and incontinence. Tadalafil was found to have similar benefits for lower urinary tract symptoms as the usually prescribed tamsulosin.\n\n\n=== Pulmonary arterial hypertension ===\nTadalafil is approved in the United States, Canada, and Japan to improve exercise ability in people with pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n\n\n== Adverse effects ==\nThe most common potential side effects when using tadalafil are headache, stomach discomfort or pain, indigestion, burping, acid reflux, back pain, myalgia (pain in limbs and extremities), flushing, hypertension (or uncommonly hypotension), and stuffy/runny nose. Also common are dizziness, peripheral edema, fatigue, and urinary or respiratory tract infection; both diarrhea and constipation have been reported. Diarrhea was reported more frequently in patients 65 or older than in younger subjects. These side effects reflect the ability of PDE5 inhibition to cause vasodilation (cause blood vessels to widen), and usually resolve after a few hours.\n\n\n=== Vision ===\nIn May 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found that tadalafil (along with other PDE5 inhibitors) was associated with vision impairment related to NAION (non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy). Most, but not all, of these patients had underlying anatomic or vascular risk factors for development of NAION, unrelated to PDE5 inhibitor use. The FDA concluded that they were not able to draw a cause and effect relationship, only an association; the label of all three PDE5 inhibitors was changed to alert clinicians to that fact. A 2019 meta-analysis found that tadalafil exposure was not associated with NAION.\n\n\n=== Hearing ===\nIn October 2007, the FDA announced that the labeling for all PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, requires a more prominent warning of the potential risk of sudden hearing loss as the result of post-marketing reports of temporary deafness associated with use of PDE5 inhibitors.\n\n\n== Metabolism ==\nTadalafil is metabolized predominantly by the liver CYP3A4 enzyme system.\n\n\n== Mechanism of action ==\nPenile erection during sexual stimulation is caused by increased penile blood flow resulting from the relaxation of penile arteries and the smooth muscle of the corpus cavernosum. This response is mediated by the release of nitric oxide (NO) from nerve terminals and endothelial cells, which stimulates the synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (more commonly known as cyclic GMP or cGMP) in smooth muscle cells. cGMP relaxes smooth muscle and increases blood flow to the corpus cavernosum.\nThe inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP. Tadalafil (and sildenafil and vardenafil) inhibits PDE5. However, because sexual stimulation is required to initiate the local penile release of nitric oxide, tadalafil's inhibition of PDE5 will have no effect without sexual stimulation.\n\n\n=== Duration of action ===\nAlthough sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil all work by inhibiting PDE5, tadalafil's pharmacologic distinction is its longer half-life (17.5 hours), compared to sildenafil and vardenafil, which are both 4–5 hours. This translates to a longer duration of action, which is partly responsible for \"The Weekend Pill\" nickname. Furthermore, the longer half-life is the basis for tadalafil's daily therapeutic use in treating pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n\n\n=== Comparison with actions of other PDE5 inhibitors ===\nSildenafil and vardenafil inhibit PDE6, an enzyme found in the eye, more than tadalafil. Some sildenafil users see a bluish tinge and have a heightened sensitivity to light because of PDE6 inhibition.\nSildenafil and vardenafil also inhibit PDE1 more than tadalafil. PDE1 is found in the brain, heart, and vascular smooth muscle. It is thought that the inhibition of PDE1 by sildenafil and vardenafil leads to vasodilation, flushing, and tachycardia.\nTadalafil inhibits PDE11 more than sildenafil or vardenafil. PDE11 is expressed in skeletal muscle, the prostate, the liver, the kidney, the pituitary gland, and the testes. The effects on the body of inhibiting PDE11 are not known.\n\n\n== Chemistry ==\nTadalafil is an annulated 2,5-diketopiperazine. It is also a 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-β-carboline.\nTadalafil can be synthesized starting from (D)-tryptophan methyl ester and piperonal via a Pictet–Spengler reaction. This is followed by condensations with chloroacetyl chloride and methylamine to complete the diketopiperazine ring:\n\n\n== History ==\nThe FDA's approval of sildenafil in 1998 was a ground-breaking commercial event for the treatment of ED, with sales exceeding US$1 billion. Subsequently, the FDA approved both vardenafil and tadalafil in 2003.\nIt initially was developed by the biotechnology company ICOS, and then again developed and marketed worldwide by Lilly ICOS, LLC, the joint venture of ICOS Corporation and Eli Lilly and Company. Tadalafil was approved in 2009 in the United States for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and is under regulatory review in other regions for this condition. In late November 2008, Eli Lilly sold the exclusive rights to commercialize tadalafil for pulmonary arterial hypertension in the United States to United Therapeutics for an upfront payment of $150 million.\nTadalafil was discovered by Glaxo Wellcome (now GlaxoSmithKline) under a partnership between Glaxo and ICOS to develop new drugs that began in August 1991. In 1993, the Bothell, Washington, biotechnology company ICOS Corporation began studying compound IC351, a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) enzyme inhibitor. In 1994, Pfizer scientists discovered that sildenafil, which also inhibits the PDE5 enzyme, caused penile erection in males participating in a clinical study of a heart medicine. Although ICOS scientists were not testing compound IC351 for treating ED, they recognized its potential usefulness for treating that disorder. Soon, in 1994, ICOS received a patent for compound IC351 (structurally unlike sildenafil and vardenafil), and Phase 1 clinical trials began in 1995. In 1997, the Phase 2 clinical studies were initiated for males experiencing ED, then progressed to the Phase 3 trials that supported the drug's FDA approval. Although Glaxo had an agreement with ICOS to share profits 50/50 for drugs resulting from the partnership, Glaxo let the agreement lapse in 1996 as the drugs developed were not in the company's core markets.\nIn 1998, ICOS Corporation and Eli Lilly and Company formed the Lilly ICOS, LLC, joint venture company to further develop and commercialize tadalafil as a treatment for ED. Two years later, Lilly ICOS, LLC, filed a new drug application with the FDA for compound IC351 (under the tadalafil generic name, and the Cialis brand name). In May 2002, Lilly ICOS reported to the American Urological Association that clinical trial testing demonstrated that tadalafil was effective for up to 36 hours, and one year later, the FDA approved tadalafil. One advantage Cialis has over Viagra and Levitra is its 17.5-hour half-life (thus Cialis is advertised to work for up to 36 hours, after which time there remains approximately 25% of the absorbed dose in the body) when compared to the four-hour half–life of sildenafil (Viagra).\nIn 2007, Eli Lilly and Company bought the ICOS Corporation for $2.3 billion. As a result, Eli Lilly owned Cialis and then closed the ICOS operations, ending the joint venture and firing most of ICOS's approximately 500 employees, except for 127 employees of the ICOS biologics facility, which subsequently was bought by CMC Biopharmaceuticals A/S (CMC).\nPersons surnamed \"Cialis\" objected to Eli Lilly and Company's so naming the drug, but the company has maintained that the drug's trade name is unrelated to the surname.\nIn October 2011, the US FDA approved tadalafil to treat the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Benign prostatic hypertrophy is a condition in which the prostate gland becomes enlarged, obstructing the free flow of urine. Symptoms may include sudden urges to urinate (urgency), difficulty in starting urination (hesitancy), a weak urine stream, and more frequent urination — especially at night. The FDA has also approved tadalafil for treatment of both benign prostatic hypertrophy and erectile dysfunction where the two conditions co-exist.\n\n\n== Society and culture ==\n\n\n=== Marketing ===\n\nIn the United States, the FDA relaxed rules on prescription drug marketing in 1997, allowing advertisements targeted directly to consumers. Lilly-ICOS hired the Grey Worldwide Agency in New York, part of the Grey Global Group, to run the Cialis advertising campaign. Marketing for Cialis has taken advantage of its greater duration compared to its competitors in advertisements for the drug; Stuart Elliot of The New York Times opined: \"The continuous presence of females in Cialis ads is a subtle signal that the drug makes it easier for them to set the pace with males, in contrast to the primarily male-driven imagery for Levitra and Viagra.\" Iconic themes in Cialis ads include couples side by side in matching bathtubs and the slogan \"When the moment is right, will you be ready?\" Cialis ads were unique among the ED drugs in mentioning specifics of the drug. As a result, Cialis ads were also the first to describe the side effects in an advertisement, as the FDA requires advertisements with specifics to mention side effects. One of the first Cialis ads aired at the 2004 Super Bowl. Just weeks before the Super Bowl, the FDA required more possible side effects to be listed in the advertisement, including priapism. Although many parents objected to the Cialis ad being aired during the Super Bowl, Janet Jackson's halftime \"wardrobe malfunction\" overshadowed Cialis. In January 2006, the Cialis ads were tweaked, adding a doctor on screen to describe side effects and only running ads where more than 90 percent of the audience are adults, effectively ending Super Bowl ads. In 2004, Lilly-ICOS, Pfizer, and GlaxoSmithKline spent a combined $373.1 million to advertise Cialis, Viagra, and Levitra respectively. Cialis has sponsored many sporting events, including the America's Cup and the PGA Tour, once being title sponsor of the PGA Tour Western Open tournament.\n\n\n=== Economics ===\nIn Australia, tadalafil is subsidized through the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (RPBS) for patients with a specific accepted war- or service-related disability.\nIn the US, a generic version of tadalafil is available. While some health insurance providers cover at least part of the cost (typically limiting the number of doses covered per month), many providers, including those operating under Medicare Part D, do not cover the cost of medications prescribed for erectile dysfunction.\nIn the UK, a generic version of tadalafil became available in November 2017, reducing its price per pill, and is available through the NHS. In China, CMOAPI is the largest manufacturer of Tadalafil powder.\n\n\n== Research ==\nTadalafil is being studied for treating Peyronie's disease.\n\n\n== References ==",

At the end of first-preference counting, she received the 5th highest vote count in Lyons, and the highest of a Greens candidate for the division, at 4,044 votes. This was not enough to be elected on first-preferences, however. As the Hare–Clark counting went on Badger, along with the Lambie candidates, received significant leakage from the Labor ticket, via Rebecca White's large surplus. This boosted Badger's own quota, and by the end of the counting after all the other Greens candidates were excluded, she had a total of 0.93 quotas, leading for her to be elected in the last spot for Lyons.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBadger lives in Ellendale, Tasmania.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hugh Ley (1790 – 24 January 1837) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLey was born in 1790 at Abingdon, Berkshire, where his father, Hugh Ley (1762–1826), was for a time a medical practitioner, afterwards settling at St. Ives, Cornwall. Hugh was educated at Dr. John Lemprière's school in his native town; subsequently became a student of the then united medical schools of St. Thomas's and Guy's Hospitals in Southwark, and took the diploma of the College of Surgeons. He then studied at Edinburgh, where he graduated M.D. 24 June 1813. His graduation thesis was on the pathology of phthisis. On 30 Sept. 1818 he was admitted a licentiate of the College of Physicians of London, and began practice in London as a man midwife. He was elected physician to the Westminster Lying-in Hospital, and soon afterwards became lecturer on midwifery at the Middlesex Hospital. On 20 April 1835 he accepted the unanimous invitation of the staff of St. Bartholomew's Hospital to deliver the lectures on midwifery in their school. His course was the first delivered in the summer, it having before been the general custom of the medical schools of London to have no regular classes except in the winter. In 1836 he published ‘An Essay on Laryngismus Stridulus, or Crouplike Inspiration of Infants,’ a volume of 480 pages. The first accurate clinical description of the disease in England is contained in the ‘Commentaries on the Diseases of Children’ (1815) of Dr. John Clarke (pt. i. p. 86), but Ley's is the first book containing a full pathological discussion of the malady. He endeavours to prove that the spasm of the larynx, which is its characteristic symptom, is caused by the pressure of enlarged lymphatic glands on the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Subsequent experience has shown that in many cases no enlarged glands are present, and the fact that the book records numerous deaths from the disease shows that its author had confused cases of tubercular meningitis with those of laryngismus stridulus, a disorder now known to be rarely, if ever, fatal. The book shows much industry, but is too long and not clear. His thesis, printed at Edinburgh in 1813, is his only other publication. He lived in Half-Moon Street, London, but died, from heart disease, at Stilton, Huntingdonshire, 24 January 1837.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1893). \"Ley, Hugh\".

It has been observed between 1050 and 1400 meters above sea level.\nThe skin of the dorsum is brown in color with darker brown marks. Mitochondrial DNA analysis indicates this frog is most similar to Kurixalus banaensis and Kurixalus viridescens\nThis frog is found in evergreen forests and scrublands on the slopes of tall hills. It perches .5 to 1 meters above the ground. It has shown some tolerance to habitat disturbance. Scientists believe it may lay eggs in holes in trees that have water in them, like other frogs in Kurixalus.\nScientists classify this as vulnerable to extinction. Its range includes two protected parks: Ngoc Linh Nature Reserve and Kon Ka Kinh National Park. Both these areas are subject to deforestation associated with farming. The construction of hydroelectric dams cause floods and earthquakes in its habitat.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Truth vs. Alex Jones is a 2024 American documentary film, directed and produced by Dan Reed. It follows families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, taking radio show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones to court for spreading lies about the shooting.\nIt had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 11, 2024, and was released on March 26, 2024, by HBO.\n\n\n== Premise ==\nFamilies of victims from the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting take radio host Alex Jones to court for spreading conspiracies and lies.\n\n\n== Production ==\nDan Reed received exclusive access to the courtroom of the trial of Alex Jones, after the judge permitted cameras and microphones. Reed attempted to interview Jones for the film, who declined. However, Jones would turn to the cameras and wink or smile, which Reed found strange.\n\n\n== Release ==\nIt had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 11, 2024. It was released on HBO and Max on March 26, 2024.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 100% of 14 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.3/10. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 86 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nBrian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, writing: \"Sharply edited, sensitively constructed, and expertly crafted. It's a reminder of how to tell this story well in a documentary film instead of dragging it out for the common docuseries trend.\" Fletcher Peters of The Daily Beast wrote: \"A scathing portrait of Jones and the vile misinformation he spread about the Sandy Hook tragedy.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nOther documentaries that also featured Alex Jones:\n\nFeels Good Man\nDay of Rage: How Trump Supporters Took the U.S. Capitol\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nThe Truth vs. Alex Jones at IMDb",

        "content": "Amelia Elizabeth White (1878–1972) and Martha Root White (died 1937), also known as The White Sisters, were sibling philanthropists and socialites born in New York, who settled in Santa Fe, New Mexico and championed for  Indigenous people's land and cultural rights. They were \"avid supporters of Indigenous arts\", and were known in the region as a \"powerhouse of reform in Native issues.\"\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nThe White sisters were born to the journalist Horace White and his wife. White was the editor in chief of the New York Evening Post, and prior to that the Chicago Tribune. The sisters both attended Bryn Mawr College and served in France with the Belgian forces as nurse assistants. \n\n\n== Biography ==\nThe sisters donated the land where the Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian was built. Their philanthropic work also included funding the School for Advanced Research, the Indian Arts Fund, the Old Santa Fe Association as well as the civic organization, the DeVargas Development Company. Additionally Amelia Elizabeth donated a large collection of San Ildefonso Pueblo pottery to the collection of the School for Advanced Research, as well as the land where the campus is located. Amelia Elizabeth also donated land for the Santa Fe Folk Art Museum, the Laboratory of Anthropology and the Museum of Navajo Ceremonial Art. Additionally she was a benefactor of the Detroit Art Institute, the Cleveland Museum of Art and the Corcoran Gallery.\nThe sisters had an affinity for Rathmullan Irish Wolfhounds and Kandahar Afghan hounds which they raised in a \"state-of-the-art kennel\" on their estate at El Delirio. Amelia Elizabeth was a dog breeder and founded the first animal shelter in Santa Fe, and helped to develop and fund the \"Dogs for Defense\" program in New Mexico as part of the WWII sentry in conjunction with the U.S. Army.\n\n\n== El Delirio estate ==\nThe sisters constructed a home in the 1920s at 660 Garcia Street in Santa Fe that they named El Delirio (The Madness) where they held elaborate costume parties for Santa Fe artists and society gatherings. Named after the sister's favorite Andalusian bar in Sevilla, Spain, the El Delirio estate was originally developed on an eight-acre parcel as a summer home for the sisters. It was designed by local artist, William Penhallow Henderson in the Spanish Pueblo Revival style of architecture. When Elizabeth died she bequeathed El Delirio and other properties she owned to the School for Advanced Research.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe Amelia White Park on Old Pecos Trail was named for Amelia Elizabeth. In 1959, the sisters first deeded the land to the Santa Fe Women's Club and Library Association to establish a clubhouse, however in 1961 the property was returned to Amelia Elizabeth who then gave it to the city of Santa Fe to establish a memorial park commemorating those who fought in the Korean Conflict. In the 1980s the park held Shakespere in the Park performances. In 1995, the park was granted certification by the National Park Service as part of the Santa Fe National Historic Trail.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "revision_id": 1219507914,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Jae Lee v. United States, 582 U.S. ___ (2017), was a Supreme Court case in which the Court held that when a criminal defendant raises Sixth Amendment ineffective assistance of counsel claims, they only need to prove by reasonable probability that they were wrongly prejudiced by their counsel to accept a plea deal rather than go to trial. The Court specified that the issue did not arise from a possibility that the outcome of Lee's conviction would've been different had he gone to trial. The case was largely decided based on the landmark case Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).\n\n\n== Historical context ==\nSources:55-year-old South Korean immigrant Jae Lee, and his family, immigrated to New York, United States, in 1982 at the age of 13. After graduating high school in New York he moved to Memphis, Tennessee and, with support from his parents, opened a Chinese restaurant in a Memphis suburb. While he found some success as a restaurateur, even opening a second restaurant nearby, Lee ultimately turned to illicit substances for further capital gains, which was known since 1999.\n\n\n=== Sting operation setup ===\nIn very early December 2008, a confidential informant (CI) informed the Drug Enforcement Administration Memphis Division and the United States Attorney's Office that they had personally purchased 200 ecstasy pills and 2 ounces of hydroponic marijuana from Lee over a period lasting from January 2001 to December 2008. The CI told authorities that they had a debt with Lee in an amount of $150, and on December 8, 2008, they gave the CI $150 in government funds to pay the debt at Lee's residence while they surveilled them from the outside. When the CI returned, they claimed to have witnessed Lee personally wrap 15 ecstasy tablets in cellophane.\nOn December 11, the authorities further provided the CI with $300 to buy 15 ecstasy pills from Lee, and while inside Lee informed the CI he now charged $20 per pill instead of $15, and the CI made the purchase anyway. With this information and proof, on January 6, 2009, the DEA executed a federal search warrant on Lee's residence. During the search of his home, the authorities found 88 ecstasy pills, 3 Valium tablets, $32,432 in cash, and a Norinco, Model 90, 7.62 caliber rifle.\n\n\n=== District Court ===\nFinally, on January 28, 2009, a federal grand jury returned a single-count indictment against Lee for possession of ecstasy with an intent to distribute. On June 17, 2009, Lee presented himself before U.S. District Court Judge Bernice B. Donald and, in accordance with a plea bargain, pleaded guilty to the sole count. Lee, under advisement from his lawyer, fully believed this conviction wouldn't affect his current immigration status, that being a permanent resident. Lee was concerned about what this conviction would be for his lawful status, a concern even somewhat brought up by Lee during the plea bargain hearing, Judge: And are you a U.S. citizen?\nLee: No, Your Honor.\nJudge: Okay. A conviction on this charge then could result in your being deported. It could also affect your ability to attain the status of a United States citizen. If you do become a United States citizen, it could affect your rights to participate in certain federal benefits, such as student loans.\nDoes that affect at all your decision about whether you want to plead guilty or not?\nLee: Yes, Your Honor.\nJudge: Okay. How does it affect your decision?\nLee: I don't understand.\nJudge: Okay. Well, knowing those things do you still want to go forward and plead guilty?\n\nLee: Yes, Your Honor.The sentence and final judgement were fully entered on October 22, 2009, due to some delays, and Lee did not directly appeal his sentence.\n\n\n==== Lee's appeal ====\nOn September 24, 2010, Lee filed a § 2255 (vacate, set aside, or correct a sentence) motion, which was eventually referred to U.S. Magistrate Judge Diane Vescovo on January 5, 2012. Judge Vescovo conducted an evidentiary hearing and eventually on August 6, 2013, she released a Recommendation and Report (R&R) to District Court Judge John Folkes in favor of Lee. Her reasoning was,\"Fitzgerald's representation of Lee was objectively unreasonable in that he affirmatively misadvised Lee as to the immigration consequences of pleading guilty to the drug-trafficking crime for which Lee was indicted.\"Despite the R&R in Lee's favor, Judge Folkes dismissed Lee's arguments and vacated Judge Vescovo's judgement on March 20, 2014. The reason for rejection was due to the fact \"Lee [had] not established prejudice.\"\n\n\n=== Circuit Court of Appeals ===\nAfter the ruling against him, Lee appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit which held oral arguments on January 28, 2016, and filed its decision on June 8. In its decision written by Circuit Court Judge Alice Batchelder the Circuit Court affirmed the District Court's decision, largely basing it off the fact \"that prejudice requires showing a “substantial, not just conceivable,” chance of a different result...\" citing Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 112 (2011). The Court, interestingly, did however seem to show compassion toward Lee's situation, saying,\"In reaching this conclusion, we should not be read as endorsing Lee’s impending deportation. It is unclear to us why it is in our national interests—much less the interests of justice—to exile a productive member of our society to a country he hasn’t lived in since childhood for committing a relatively small-time drug offense. But our duty is neither to prosecute nor to pardon; it is simply to say “what the law is.” Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 177 (1803).\"\n\n\n== Supreme Court decision ==\nLee then further appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari on December 14, 2016, held arguments on March 28, 2017, and handed down its decision on June 23, 2017. In a 6-2 decision, the Court sided with Lee, overturned the Circuit and District Court's decisions, and remanded the case. Chief Justice John Roberts authored the majority opinion, with Justice Clarence Thomas writing a dissent, and was joined by Justice Samuel Alito.\n\n\n=== Majority opinion ===\nSource:The majority opinion established the issue at fact, and there was no issue in regards to whether the advice Lee's lawyer gave him was \"effective\", which it wasn't. The issue at hand was \"whether Lee can show he was prejudiced by that erroneous advice.\"\n\nThe majority denies the dissent's claims as well, saying,\"The dissent contends that a defendant must also show that he would have been better off going to trial. That is true when the defendant’s decision about going to trial turns on his prospects of success and those are affected by the attorney’s error—for instance, where a defendant alleges that his lawyer should have but did not seek to suppress an improperly obtained confession. Premo v. Moore, 562 U. S. 115, 118 (2011)\" The majority realizes and admits the fact the case was interesting in its \"he said, she said\" type demeanor, saying,\"Lee, on the other hand, argues he can establish prejudice under Hill because he never would have accepted a guilty plea had he known that he would be deported as a result. Lee insists he would have gambled on trial, risking more jail time for whatever small chance there might be of an acquittal that would let him remain in the United States The Government responds that, since Lee had no viable defense at trial, he would almost certainly have lost and found himself still subject to deportation, with a lengthier prison sentence to boot. Lee, the Government contends, cannot show prejudice from accepting a plea where his only hope at trial was that something unexpected and unpredictable might occur that would lead to an acquittal.\" (citation omitted)The Court ultimately ruled in favor of Lee from its belief that had his attorney not misled him as to the effect the plea bargain on his immigration status, he likely wouldn't have taken it, saying,\"Lee’s claim that he would not have accepted a plea had he known it would lead to deportation is backed by substantial and uncontroverted evidence. Accordingly we conclude Lee has demonstrated a “reasonable probability that, but for [his] counsel’s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial. Hill\" (citation omitted)\n\n\n=== Thomas' dissent ===\nJustice Thomas, joined by Justice Alito in all but Part I, wrote a dissenting opinion, firstly stating that at this point \"[T]he Court today holds that a defendant can undo a guilty plea, well after sentencing and in the face of overwhelming evidence of guilt\".Thomas rejects the use of the Sixth Amendment in this case, citing his dissent in Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 388 (2010). He further dissents on the fact that Strickland establishes that Lee must show \"reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” He argues that even if Lee had not taken the plea and gone to trial originally, the outcome would have been no different and thus fails to meet the strict Strickland standards.\n\n\n== References ==",

She taught about, performed, and collected folk music, dances, and costumes from Eastern and Central Europe, and organized folk dance and music events in the United States.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMarek was born in New York City and raised in Worcester, Massachusetts, the daughter of William Marek and Frances Pospisil Marek. Both of her parents immigrated from Bohemia, and her first language was Czech. Her mother died in 1901. Marek showed talent at the violin from an early age.\n\n\n== Career ==\nCushing traveled in Europe collecting folk music. She taught and performed European folk music and dance, sometimes wearing traditional costumes, in Europe and the United States. \"The program that Stella Marek Cushing presents is both educational and entertaining,\" explained a 1929 newspaper, \"but it is even more the endeavor of a gifted daughter of a great people to bring to the America she loves something of the culture and art and music of her fatherland.\"Cushing was credited as an arranger on several recordings of folk songs for the Victor label in 1936 and 1937. In 1936, she co-directed a folk festival in Montclair, New Jersey. In 1937, she was decorated by the Czech government with the Order of the White Lion, for her contributions to Czech culture. She served on the executive board of the Folk Festival Council of New York, and taught at the American Institute of Normal Methods in Massachusetts. She was active in the Universalist Church. \"I believe that a fuller knowledge of the life and culture of a foreign people will do as much toward bringing about goodwill and understanding between nations as any amount of political and economic education,\" she told an interviewer in 1934.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nSongs of work and worship (1923)\n\"Trips Abroad: Russia and Ukraine\", \"Trips Abroad: Poland and Czechoslovakia\", \"Trips Abroad, Sweden\", \"Trips Abroad: The Southern Slavs\", \"Trips Abroad: Italy\", \"Trips Abroad: Japan\", \"Trips Abroad: China\", \"A Playground in Kiev\", \"At the Frontier\", \"Christ is Born\", \"Street Scene in Hong Kong\", \"Plays, Pageants, and Festivals\", \"Midsummer Magic\", \"At Home in Japan\", and \"Vendemmia\", in Music Highways and Byways\n\n\n== Personal life and legacy ==\nMarek married engineer Samuel Truman Cushing in 1917. They had a son, Donald. She died in 1938, in her forties, at her home in Montclair, New Jersey. There is a box of her papers in the collection of the New York Public Library. The Montclair Library established a folklore collection as a memorial to Cushing. In 1948, pianist Harriet Cohen and librarian Margery Quigley gave special books to the Montclair Library in Cushing's memory.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Joseph Letherland (1699 – 31 March 1764) was a Scottish physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLetherland was born at Stratford-on-Avon in 1699. He entered the university of Leyden 30 September 1722, and graduated M.D. 5 July 1724 with an inaugural dissertation, ‘Veterum medicorum sententiæ de Phrenitide curandâ’ (Leyden, 1724, 4to). Some years afterwards he was created doctor of medicine of Cambridge by royal mandate 9 April 1736, and thus qualified for the fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians, where he was admitted candidate 30 September 1736, and fellow 30 September 1737, afterwards holding the office of censor and other college dignities. He was elected physician to St. Thomas's Hospital 7 July 1736, and resigned that office at the close of 1758. In 1761 Letherland was appointed physician to the queen, on the recommendation of Dr. William Heberden the elder, who had declined the honour. He died 31 March 1764, and was buried in the church of St. Mary, Aldermanbury, where a memorial tablet was placed to him.\nLetherland always practised in London, but without becoming much known to the public, though he was highly esteemed by his colleagues for his learning and professional attainments. His classical learning was shown in a reply to Conyers Middleton's dissertation on the servile condition of physicians among the Romans, in which he vindicated the position of the Roman physicians: ‘Notæ breves in Dissertationem de Medicorum apud Romanos conditione a C. Middleton editam,’ 8vo, London, 1726. This was his only separate publication, but he is known to have contributed largely to John Fothergill's ‘Account of the Sore Throat attended with Ulcers,’ 1748. The historical portion, identifying the disease with one described by Spanish physicians in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, is admitted to be his work (Thomas Healde, Oratio Harveiana, 4to, London, 1765). Indeed, he has the credit of being the first to draw attention to this disease (the modern diphtheria) in 1739 (John Chandler, On the Disease called a Cold, 1761, p. 56), though he modestly never asserted his claim to priority.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Payne, Joseph Frank (1893). \"Letherland, Joseph\".

        "content": "The Bells of Basel (French: Les Cloches de Bâle) is a novel by Louis Aragon, the first in the cycle Le Monde Réel (The Real World), first published in 1934. It was a groundbreaking work in the author's oeuvre, confirming his departure from surrealism previously promoted, in favor of realism with a clear ideological message. From then on, the writer regarded his novels not only as literary works but also as Marxist social analyses aimed at encouraging readers to engage in the labor movement.\nThe first translation of The Bells of Basel into English was made by Haakon Chevalier in 1937.\n\n\n== Circumstances of creation ==\nAccording to Roger Garaudy, The Bells of Basel is a pioneering book, a transitional work, in the process of writing which Aragon was developing the language, structure, and style typical of later works. This work was intended to be a complete departure from the author's previous creativity, based on the general outline of Le Monde Réel, on the one hand, and on the other hand, being a kind of experimental novel, the plan of which changed during the writing process. The shape of the work was particularly influenced by the author's wife, Elsa Triolet, who read the emerging fragments of the novel on an ongoing basis and was their first reviewer. According to Garaudy, Triolet's critical comments on the form of the first part of the novel prompted Aragon to change the form of the second and third parts. Zofia Jaremko-Pytowska emphasizes that the thorough change in Aragon's writing style was related to the realistic literary tradition of France, works in which the psychological analysis of the individual was combined with a detailed description of the social background. This type of literature was advocated as the most complete in the circles of Western European left-wing, to which the writer belonged. However, Aragon consciously rejected the postulate of neutrality in narration advocated by French realist writers, deciding to make the novel a reflection of his own Marxist political views. The choice of the work's themes was influenced by the atmosphere of the contemporary era for the creator. Aware of the danger of a new world war breaking out, he decided to present in the novel the years preceding the beginning of the previous one. The concept of the work underwent further, albeit less significant transformations as it was created, remaining in close relation to the author's political commitment.\nAragon dedicated the finished novel to Elsa Triolet.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe Bells of Basel consists of four parts: Diana, Catherine, Victor, and Clara.\n\n\n=== Diana ===\nThe main character of this part is Diana de Nettencourt, a divorcee, the last descendant of a ruined aristocratic family, a dissolute woman living off the money of successive wealthy lovers. Eventually, for money, she marries a wealthy man named Brunel, who turns out to be a pimp and usurer. When one of his clients, Peter de Sabran, a representative of an old aristocratic family, commits suicide, Diana leaves her husband to avoid losing her reputation as an honest woman. After obtaining a legal separation from her husband, she becomes the mistress of the industrialist Wisner, while her bankrupt husband, on the advice of the same entrepreneur, joins the police as an agent provocateur.\n\n\n=== Catherine ===\nThe main character of this part is a Georgian by origin and the daughter of an industrialist from Baku and a luxury courtesan. She spends her childhood traveling with her mother, observing men courting her. She grows into a beautiful woman but does not want to share her mother's fate in the future. Infatuated with the military man Thiebault, she becomes his mistress but ends the relationship with him – though financially beneficial – when he takes part in suppressing a strike in Cluses. The image of the workers' demonstration prompts her to rebel against her own environment. Catherine starts attending anarchist meetings, where she falls under the influence of the charismatic activist, Libertad. However, gradually, the anarchist worldview also begins to disappoint her. She accidentally witnesses the murder of Libertad by the police, after which she learns that he was an agent provocateur.\n\n\n=== Victor ===\nConvinced of the emptiness of her life, Catherine accidentally finds a mention in the newspaper of the suicide of Paul and Laura Lafargue. This event suggests to her the idea of ending her own life in a similar way. However, at the moment she wants to throw herself into the Seine, she is stopped by a young chauffeur, Victor Deyhanin. Feeling sudden trust in the man, she tells him the story of her life. He decides to introduce the young Georgian woman to the environment of workers and labor activists. In Paris, a major strike of taxi drivers takes place, which Victor helps to organize. Catherine, distrustful of socialist ideals, feels alien among the workers, not understanding the goals of their struggle. She criticizes Victor's views from the standpoint of anarchism, but gradually, under his influence, she breaks with the proclaimed praise of individual terror and attacks. In Paris, at the turn of 1911–1912, a sense of inevitable war grows, and further workers' protests erupt. In the National Assembly vote, the socialists, contrary to earlier announcements, vote to grant war credits to the government. Catherine again hesitates between the elegant society her mother wants to introduce her to and the anarchists. Her political sympathies are detected by the police, and she is arrested and forced to leave France.\n\n\n=== Epilogue – Clara ===\n\nIn the epilogue, the congress of the Second International in 1912 is depicted in the Basel Minster. Delegates from all sections of the organization are present in the city. Jean Jaurès delivers a great anti-war speech. On the last day of the congress, the voice is taken by Clara Zetkin, a member of the German Social Democratic Party, whom Aragon – unlike other women appearing in the work – presents as a woman of the future, truly worthy of praise.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Form and message of the novel ===\nAccording to Roger Garaudy:One cannot judge this novel and its composition by classical criteria. It is not built on the basis of action development. It submits to the internal dialectics of the writer's development and his times.Despite the overall structure as a novel, there are clear differences between its individual parts. Diana was written in a constructionally similar manner to Honoré de Balzac's novella. Such a narrative approach was criticized by Elsa Triolet, who suggested a different, more free-form text to the writer. This suggestion was actually applied in the second and third parts. However, Garaudy believes that the first part, although the least innovative, is the most formally successful component of the novel.\nAragon later claimed that it was during the writing of The Bells of Basel that he learned to write novels and admitted that the work contains numerous formal flaws resulting from his lack of experience in this type of writing. He was also harsh in his assessment of all his texts written between 1930 and 1935 when he moved away from surrealism towards realism. In the novel itself, he included another comment in this regard, stating that the \"poor construction\" of the work reflects a similarly improper social structure, in which the reader should engage in changing:The world, reader, is poorly constructed, just as poorly constructed as you think my book is. Yes, both must be reworked, with Clara as the protagonist, not with Diana and not with Catherine. If I have encouraged you even a little to do so, you can tear up this little book, what do I care!By dividing the novel into three parts and an epilogue, Aragon indicated that each component of the work is dedicated to a different social layer. The first part depicts the wealthiest circles of France, industrialists, military, and the slowly declining aristocracy. The second part is devoted to the representative of the previously described environment, who wants to break away from it. The third part is dedicated to French workers, while the epilogue, resembling the form of a journalistic report, anticipates a better world that the socialist revolution is supposed to bring. The strict allocation of characters to their social environments – except for Catherine – significantly influences their characterization and the resulting assessment. The characters in The Bells of Basel are generally already formed and do not change throughout the action. The events involving them gradually reveal their hidden traits, contributing to the unmasking of the entire environment. An exemplary case is the character of Brunel, who initially appears as an elegant and well-mannered man but turns out to be capable of murder, a usurer, a police provocateur, and a cynic. The characters of The Bells of Basel are typically one-dimensional. By primarily wanting to present a general picture of each social class, Aragon does not differentiate psychologically between the people constituting them. Consequently, both unambiguously negative representatives of the world of financial elites and workers depicted solely in a positive light (although not activists) become schematic characters. According to Jaremko-Pytowska, the merits of the work in terms of social analysis do not correspond to a thorough psychology of individual characters; the only exception is the continuously metamorphosing Catherine.\nUnambiguous assessments of characters and entire environments build the political message of the work: Aragon expresses support for the labor movement, against the prevailing form of the capitalist system in his time, even when the activists of this movement espouse views not as radical as his own. By making women the main characters of the text, he also presents his stance on the feminist movement: women can only be liberated when they actively engage in the labor movement, recognizing the connection between gender inequality and economic stratification of society. The conclusion of such a constructed message is a call to the reader contained in the epilogue:Your strength is also needed to transform the world.This appeal is one of several direct authorial comments placed by Aragon in the epilogue of the work.\nThe significance of collective action is emphasized by the construction of scenes involving crowds in the work, depicted in an extremely vivid manner, as a force with a specific goal, not as a disorganized mass. However, focusing on the general ideology of crowds and their most common beliefs results in a complete abandonment of characterizing individual workers, even achieving their artificial uniformity. Despite this, The Bells of Basel is an important work in the history of French literature addressing wage laborers: for the first time, the world of workers and associated socialist activists was depicted in such a broad way.\nIn a review by Georges Sadoul that appeared shortly after the publication of The Bells of Basel, this novel was described as the first example of socialist realism in French literature. However, J. Heistein opposes the unequivocal classification of the novel as implementing the Soviet concept of socialist realist novels. Despite the work being based on clear ideological foundations, Aragon retained many features of surrealist writing in The Bells of Basel, primarily the lack of uniformity in style and the overlapping of plotlines (collage technique). This author believes that there is not as clear a contrast between The Bells of Basel and Aragon's earlier work as the writer himself claimed.\n\n\n==== Language ====\nA notable expression of stylistic changes occurring in various parts of the work is the modification of the language of the text. In the first part, Aragon expresses his disdain, at best indifference, towards the lives of the wealthiest French people through linguistic means. Irony and elements of satire disappear in passages dedicated to the experiences of Victor and Catherine. In turn, the epilogue is written in a lofty style, almost akin to an epic, emphasizing the significance of the events described and the entire labor movement. The language of the characters is modified in a special way, with their manner of speaking changing on one hand under the influence of the social environment (widespread use of workers' jargon), and on the other hand – reflecting their personal experiences and reflections.\n\n\n=== The Bells of Basel as a historical novel ===\nWriting the novel, Aragon aimed to depict as faithfully as possible the social life of France on the eve of World War I. However, his political views significantly influenced the selection of readings that would help him understand past events, thereby co-creating the final message of the text. In order to better understand the economic structure of the Third Republic, he analyzed it based on Marxist texts – articles published in the economic section of L'Humanité and Vladimir Lenin's essay Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. Aragon also incorporated Lenin's views on reformism, anarchism, and the activities of the Second International into the work (views with which he fully identified).\nIn his work, Aragon refers to authentic events – the Second Moroccan Crisis, the Balkan Wars, the suicide and funeral of Paul and Laura Lafargue – which influenced the attitudes of various social classes in the period preceding World War I. Political events constitute an important axis of the work. According to Garaudy, the rhythm of the work is determined by the growing awareness of the inevitability of war and the successive events leading to its outbreak –  even when the characters are not directly involved.\nHowever, particular attention is paid to the taxi drivers' strike in 1911, which is described based on the author's experiences related to another mass labor protest that took place in 1934. At that time, Aragon, a member of the editorial board of L'Humanité, was responsible for daily reports documenting the course of this strike. He drew a number of details contained in the work from there: the image of workers' solidarity and attacks on strikebreakers, police provocation, the death of the driver Bédhomme during the demonstration, and his funeral. Roger Garaudy highly values the part dedicated to the strike, its authenticity, and the strength of expression resulting from it. Zofia Jaremko-Pytowska, however, offers a different assessment, stating that Aragon saturated this part of the novel with details, wanting to include all his own impressions related to the strike.\n\nThe culminating point of the work is the description of the congress of the Second International in Basel, contained in the epilogue titled Clara. Aragon provides a monumental description of it, emphasizing the personal qualities, determination, and charisma of many leaders of the International. However, he admits that the political effects of the congress were different from those assumed, and the described leaders were soon to vote in national parliaments for the granting of war credits to governments, thus contrary to the program of the labor movement. Finally, the sound of the titular bells heralds the inevitable outbreak of armed conflict:It was in vain to think that the cathedral was on the side of the congress, that it was in the cathedral that the word of peace would resound, the sound of the bells relentlessly took on the accent of beating for alarm. They rang for war, for danger.\n\n\n=== The Bells of Basel as a novel about love ===\nLouis Aragon emphasized the importance of female characters and related love plots in his works. Roger Garaudy even argues that love, considered in strict relation to social structure, is the main theme of the work. The first three parts of the novel demonstrate the impossibility of true love in capitalist society, as one of its elements, according to the author, is making women subservient to men. Only in the finale of the work, when Klara Zetkin speaks, Aragon expresses faith in the rebirth of love that will occur in socialist society when women and men truly become equals. True love, therefore, does not rely on entering into successive relationships for financial gain, as Diana de Nettencourt does, nor on free love, as practiced by the rebellious Catherine Simonidze against her own environment. The relationship between two free individuals, genuine devotion to each other, constitutes a natural element of human striving for perfection and happiness.\n\n\n=== The Bells of Basel as a coming-of-age novel ===\n\nThe second key theme of the work is the problem of ideological transformation, which many intellectuals and artists, including Aragon himself, underwent during his time. As Aragon explained in La Nouvelle Critique in 1949:In The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, one sentence struck me, which said that there will come a moment when the best part of the bourgeoisie will join the side of the working class. I wanted to describe the first forms of this transition.In doing so, the author also described his own ideological evolution – transitioning from the praise of artistic individualism and full freedom of the individual to the advocacy of social engagement on the side of the labor movement.\nHis expanded alter ego in the work is considered to be the character of Catherine. This character, the daughter of a wealthy industrialist from Baku, tries to completely break ties with her social class, whose way of life she finds repugnant. Initially, she seeks freedom in anarchism and free love, but the awareness of being dependent on the money sent to her by her father, her sole means of support, makes her realize the futility of these attempts. Catherine is also unable to fully integrate into the working-class environment, where the chauffeur Victor Deyhanin tries to introduce her. She only looks at the striking workers with curiosity because their motivation, typically economic, is not synonymous with her search for the meaning of life. Some of Catherine's behaviors have clear origins in the doubts of the writer himself from the period when he participated in formulating surrealist doctrine. The surrealists wanted to reject all cultural achievements of previous generations – similarly, Simonidze is outraged that a funeral march by Frédéric Chopin is played at the funeral of a slain worker. Moreover, in Catherine's conversation with Victor, Aragon presents a negative answer to the question previously posed by the surrealists about the meaning of suicide.\nHowever, Catherine is unable to completely break away from her environment. Expelled from France, although she makes contact with the British left, she still behaves like an observer of the lives of workers, rather than an active participant, although the narrator suggests that she ultimately adopted socialist views as her own. Her attitude, full of fluctuations until the end, is also criticized and contrasted with the behavior of Clara Zetkin. Catherine's transformation is more spiritual and internal than practical. Her subsequent changes largely occur under the influence of chance – the character accidentally comes across a procession of striking workers in Cluses, then incidentally sees an anarchist poster, and finally, under similar circumstances, forms a relationship with Victor. Aragon therefore does not conclude the description of the process of Catherine's transformations with a definitive conclusion. The first character in the works of this writer whose \"journey to socialism\" will be depicted in its entirety will only be Armand, the main character of Les Beaux Quartiers.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nImmediately upon its release, the novel was described by G. Sadoul as a socialist realist work. The work was mainly evaluated by critics associated with the French Communist Party and by Soviet reviewers, in terms of the ideological realization of communist demands in literature and art. These authors received the novel with mixed feelings. The portrayal of the possessing classes and left-wing activists did not arouse controversy among them, but there were accusations of an unwitting idealization of the anarchist movement in the second part of the work. Some Soviet critics considered the novel as evidence that the French communist left did not yet have a fully developed program.\nLater criticism highly praised especially the first part, as a portrayal of the daily life of the wealthiest French people depicted through a series of seemingly unrelated scenes.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAragon, Louis (1936).

He was a leader of the Nun'Álvares National Crusade in the final years of the First Portuguese Republic and one of the founders of the National Unionist Movement (1932). He joined the National Revolution and, among many other important positions, was Undersecretary of State for Corporations and Social Welfare (1944 to 1948) and Minister for the Economy (1948 to 1950) in Oliveira Salazar's government, president of the National Union's executive committee (1958 to 1961 and 1965 to 1968), a member of the National Assembly and a prosecutor in the Corporate Chamber.

        "revision_id": 1219044945,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The Bäckadräkten is considered Sweden's first unisex folk costume, designed in 2022 by musician Fredy Clue and textile designer Ida Björs. The design merges elements traditionally considered either male or female, like the vest that is also a bodice and the culottes that present as a skirt. The primary theme of flowing water is present throughout the outfit, which otherwise borrows heavily from older folk costumes representing regions throughout Sweden. Clue said the Bäckadräkten is intended to invite wider participation in Swedish folk traditions by providing an outfit that is not restricted to any specific gender or geographic area.\nDiscussions about a potential unisex design for Sweden started in the early 2010s and the idea that led to the Bäckadräkten originated with Clue in 2018. Their partnership with the Textile Museum of Borås grew into a six-month design and production process that involved input from non-binary Swedes and assistance from other clothing and accessory specialists. The resulting single costume is worn by Clue when performing as a nyckelharpist and lecturer on non-binary and transgender involvement in Swedish folk arts. Because of the geographic distribution of its influences, the outfit is considered more a product of Sweden's national queer community than of any individual region. Clue released a sewing pattern in 2023, encouraging users to make modifications as they see fit.\nThe design release attracted international press attention and generated discussions on social media, much of the latter about the relationship between folk traditions and gender more broadly. Many have welcomed the development, saying it provides opportunity for non-binary Swedes to be more involved in folk culture. Others have reacted negatively, resisting the social change they see as associated with it. Clue said they hope the discussion raises awareness of non-cisgender identities.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe Bäckadräkten requires a small-scale, handmade production process. It is based on older Swedish folk costumes from various regions across the country, particularly the hometowns of co-designers Fredy Clue and Ida Björs: Gothenburg and Järvsö. Otherwise, the costume's primary design theme is flowing water. The shape of ocean waves are present in the costume, as are elements of nautical navigation and culture. Clue expressed their core inspiration: \"The brook ... represents our life force, which flows and changes every day, even though we are still the same water.\" The costume's culottes are called kyxa. The word is formed by combining the Swedish word for skirt, kjol, with byxa (pants).: 4  Clue likened the kyxa to an Irish kilt, which Björs said was the hardest part of the costume for her to produce, given its fine pleats. The top half of the costume is similarly defined by a combination of traditionally male and female dress: what appears like a bodice in the front, but a vest in the back. Its fabric, sourced from Ljusdal, is traditionally used by men in that region for wedding vests, but coincidentally bears the colors of the modern transgender flag: white, pink, and light blue. Called a livstycke, Clue said it is the hardest part of the costume to produce.Clue has called the hat \"the queerest part of the suit\". The design is traditionally worn by men in most of Sweden, except in the region surrounding Borås, where it is worn only by women. Described generically as a wedge cap, this design is round, with a black brim. Its reversibility allows the top to display either pink or light blue.: 3  The shoe is based on traditional wedding footwear from Hälsingland that features a heel in the middle of the sole. Unlike the wedding shoe, the Bäckadräkten shoe heel is at the back of the sole and shaped like the hull of a ship. The tongue features a heart shape to match the brooch. The brooch is heart-shaped, engraved with the transgender symbol, and surrounded by dangling leaves patterned with flowing water. The brooch pins together the costume's square standing collar, which is borrowed from the traditional folk costume of Järvsö. Worn over the shoulders is an orange shawl with a stream printed on it.: 3–4  The socks are white with pink and blue ribbons.: 4 \n\n\n== Background ==\nWhat are referred to in Scandinavia as national costumes and folk costumes originated as basic clothing for Scandinavians of lower economic classes. Starting in the early 20th century, experts formalized the designs into costumes to represent their respective countries, as well as regions within them. In 21st-century Sweden, there are at least 840 different accepted designs to represent different parts of that country, plus one national costume, the Sverigedräkten. Like Finland, Sweden maintains a strict definition of what qualifies as the male or female version of their national costume. Since the early 2010s, social media channels, radio, and newspapers across Norway, Finland, and Sweden have been hosting discussions about experimentations with unisex folk costume designs.While most Swedes are exposed to the folk arts through costuming, artist and musician Fredy Clue was first exposed through folk dance and music. Clue was bothered by the fact that all traditional costumes were assigned either a male or female gender, and brought this up with a friend at the 2018 Bingsjöstämman folk festival. They brainstormed the possibility of combining pants and a skirt to make a design that is both traditional and unisex. Clue felt a unisex option would help more people feel included in their national culture. Clue has stated that because non-binary Swedes exist, there needs to be a folk costume they can wear without having to choose between male and female forms. Acknowledging the potential for controversy, Clue told the BBC: \"I got into folk culture a little bit sideways – maybe that helped me to be less afraid to break the rules.\"\n\n\n== Development ==\nAfter developing the initial idea for the Bäckadräkten in 2018, Clue sought assistance from Textile Museum of Borås curator Frida Andersson. Between that year and 2021, they developed a collaboration with Borås Pride, brainstormed the Bäckadräkten project, and applied for grant funding. The project was financed by the Västra Götaland Regional Council and two nonprofit organizations that support youth in the Swedish folk and cultural communities: Folk You and Kulturungdom. Because Clue had no background in either fashion design or clothing production, Andersson connected them to illustrator and textile designer, Ida Björs. Björs had a background in producing folk costumes for art exhibitions, but had neither produced clothing for active wear, nor collaborated with a project partner on a clothing project. The two worked together on the Bäckadräkten project as co-designers.Starting in January 2022, Clue and Björs studied historical folk costume designs from various Swedish regions and traveled to Björs's home province of Hälsingland to study its folk culture. In the spring of that year, they formed a focus group with five young, non-binary people from the Swedish folk community. The focus group met multiple times, mostly using Zoom software because of the group's wide geographic distribution throughout the country. Each member produced sketches of their own ideal costume designs. One of those sketches was eventually used as the basis for the Bäckadräkten's brooch. Because Clue and Björs drew influence from costumes and focus group members associated with multiple regions, the Bäckadräkten is considered more a product of Sweden's nationwide queer community than of any individual region.Björs sewed and assembled the first Bäckadräkten, utilizing specialized assistance from other clothing and accessory designers. Dance shoe designer Helena Karlsson from Rättvik helped design and produce the costume's shoe. Leather tailor Pär Swedin from Delsbo made the belt, and silversmith Karin Li from Järvsö made the brooch.\n\n\n== Release ==\nBy June 2022, Clue and Björs had produced one copy of the Bäckadräkten in Clue's size. Widely reported as Sweden's first unisex folk costume, it was exhibited at the Textile Museum from June 30, 2022, though August 28, 2022. The exhibit's opening was timed to coincide with the pride festival in Borås. Located in the museum's lobby, \"Bäckadräkten – en Ickebinär Folkdräkt\" detailed the Bäckadräkten's production process and juxtaposed it against unisex design elements from early-20th-century Swedish folk costumes. Also on display was a 1964 folk costume catalog showing all available products as designed strictly for either male or female wearers.During the exhibition and afterward, Clue has worn the Bäckadräkten to public performances, at which they lecture about the costume, play the nyckelharpa, or both, as was the case at the Delsbo spelmansstämma folk music and dance festival in July 2022. Clue announced the sewing pattern was available as of May 2023. Clue sells copies of the pattern and has said they plan to produce more costumes based on that pattern. Clue has encouraged Swedes to develop variations on the original pattern to fit individual users' character or hometown, saying: \"The real work continues with us learning to listen to oneself and others. I hope that you keep on playing with this costume.\" A year after that quote was published, one of the Bäckadräkten project focus group members presented Clue with a cardigan for the costume at the pride festival in Hudiksvall. Björs said she believes that in the future, the Bäckadräkten will be remembered as the first of many unisex Swedish folk costume designs.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Bäckadräkten's release was covered by news outlets in Sweden, the UK, Finland, and South Africa. A post about it on the official Facebook page of Sweden was shared by users on that platform over 1,900 times and attracted over 1,500 comments and 6,700 reactions. The announcement sparked discussions on social media about the relationship between gender and folk tradition. Many in the media and Sweden's folk community have welcomed the new development. Culture critic and Borås Tidning journalist Agnes Brusk Jahn praised what she saw as the potential for non-binary Swedes to participate more in folk traditions. Resisting the broader social change they associate with the Bäckadräkten, many social media users and folks arts participants expressed discomfort with what they say is a validation of the non-binary gender identity. Clue referred to detractors within the Swedish folk community as the dräpo, or dress police, saying: \"Many people feel threatened, they feel that men and women are being blurred\". Clue did not report any reactions from the organization responsible for maintaining the definition of the official national costume of Sweden.Clue welcomed the discussion, hoping that it results in greater awareness of non-binary and transgender identities. Clue responded to critics by making clear that the presence of a new costume does not necessitate the elimination of any others. Clue argued that some change in folk costumery is inevitable, given that modern attempts to replicate historic clothing often rely on new materials and production methods that produce slightly different outcomes than older ones. The availability of the Bäckadräkten, Clue pointed out, simply provides a folk costume option that anybody can use, regardless of gender.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNationella dräkten\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBäckadräkten page on Fredy Clue's website\nBäckadräkten page on Dräktnyckel index of Swedish folk costumes",

        "content": "Ryo Shigaki (志垣 良, Shigaki Ryo, born 9 May 1980) is a Japanese professional football manager who is the manager of J2 League club Renofa Yamaguchi.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nAfter graduating from Higashi Fukuoka High School in 1998, Shigaki moved to England. From 1999 to 2000, he played for Solihull Borough, then moved to Racing Club Warwick between 2000 and 2001.\n\n\n== Coaching career ==\nShigaki had a range of different coaching jobs in England, while studying Football Science at Liverpool John Moores University. Between 2001 and 2005, he worked as a coach for Southport FC and Tranmere Rovers, as well as being a soccer school coach at Manchester United.\nIn 2006, Shigaki moved back to Japan, initially working as an interpreter at Nagoya Grampus, and in 2007 he also became a coach at the club. Between 2008 and 2016, Shigaki worked as a coach for a number of clubs, including Avispa Fukuoka, Oita Trinita, JEF United Chiba, Gainare Tottori and Júbilo Iwata. During this time, he gained his A-Class coach general license in 2012.\nAfter leaving Júbilo Iwata, Shigaki was named Singapore Sports School U-14 Coach in 2017, followed by becoming the national coach of Singapore national U-17 football team. He was managing the team for the 2017 Japan-ASEAN U-16 Youth Football Tournament, the 2018 Jockey Cup and the 2018 AFF U-16 Youth Championship. In 2018, he became a JFA certified S-class coach.\nIn January 2019, Shigaki returned to Gainare Tottori after six years away as head coach. Unable to help Tottori gain promotion to the J2 League, Shigaki left his role at the end of the 2020 season.\nFor the 2021 season, he was appointed as the U-18 coach of Kyoto Sanga.\n\n\n== Managerial career ==\n\n\n=== Vanraure Hachinohe ===\nIn 2022, he was named as a coach at Thai club BG Pathum United, until midway through the season, he was appointed as the successor of Masahiro Kuzuno at Vanraure Hachinohe, Shigaki's first managerial role. In his first game, six days after his appointment, Vanraure lost 2–1 to AC Nagano Parceiro, however his first win was to follow in their next league game against Fukushima United. It was undoubtedly a difficult start for Shigaki, as his team lost nine of their first twelve games under his stewardship. The season did end on a high though, with the club winning eight of their last ten games of the season. It was decided at the end of the 2022 season that he would be leaving Vanraure Hachinohe.\n\n\n=== FC Osaka ===\nIn December 2022, Shigaki was named as FC Osaka manager for the 2023 J3 League season – their first season in the J.League. It was another difficult start for Shigaki and his new club, finding themselves 19th in the table after the fifth match week, however they greatly improved as the season continued and were in second place in the league at the end of match week 26. FC Osaka finished the season in 11th place, with Shigaki having won 14 of his 38 games in charge.\n\n\n=== Renofa Yamaguchi ===\nShigaki had impressed in his first full season as manager, and in December 2023, just before FC Osaka's final league game of the season, he was announced as manager of J2 League club Renofa Yamaguchi  for the 2024 season.\n\n\n== Managerial statistics ==\nAs of 23 March 2024\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 2004, Shigaki was a finalist in the British Council's International Student Award and received a silver award and a £1,000 prize for his contribution.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nProfile at Renofa Yamaguchi\nSoccerway",

        "content": "The Boathouse Riddle is a 1931 detective novel by the British author Alfred Walter Stewart, published under his pseudonym J.J. Connington.  It is the sixth in his series of seventeen novels featuring the Golden Age Detective Chief Constable Sir Clinton Driffield. The title is also written as The Boat-House Riddle.\nTwo years earlier with Nemesis at Raynham Parva had effectively seemed to have retired his lead character, in a style similar to Arthur Conan Doyle attempt to conclude the Sherlock Holmes series in The Final Problem. An attempt to replace Sir Clinton with a new lead character, Superintendent Ross in two novels had been less successful and he returned as Chief Constable.  Significantly for the formula of the series, Clinton's friend Wendover who had only appeared in two of the first five books featured in every novel of the series afterwards. The Boathouse Riddle received a positive review in A Catalogue of Crime by Jacques Barzun and Wendell Hertig Taylor.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nOverworked and needing a break, Sir Clinton accepts an invitation to stay at the country house of his friend Wendover. Wendover has a new boathouse and the two men are looking forwards to a few weeks quiet fishing. But the murder of a gamekeeper on the adjacent estate provides a series of puzzles that intrigue Sir Clinton who directs the local police force in their investigation.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBarzun, Jacques & Taylor, Wendell Hertig.

        "content": "Gaëlle Bélem (born 1984) is a French writer of Réunionese extraction known for the prize-winning coming-of-age novel Un monstre est là, derrière la porte (2020), and the historical novel Le fruit le plus rare : ou la vie d'Edmond Albius (2023).\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGaëlle Bélem was born in Saint-Benoît, Réunion, grew up in a modest family and has been writing since the age of twelve. She left Réunion at the age of 17, and studied in Toulouse, France, at the Lycée Pierre-de-Fermat from 2002 to 2005, and subsequently at Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne University in 2005 and finally at École Pratique des Hautes Études. In 2009 she started as a teacher of history and geography in Île-de-France. Back in Réunion, she continued to work as a teacher of Latin, history and geography, first in middle school and later in high school. She also taught in a detention center and functions as an associate judge in a juvenile court.\nIn 2020 she published her first novel Un monstre est là, derrière la porte (translated title: A Monster is There, Behind the Door). The novel was awarded the 2020 Grand prix du roman métis as well as the André-Dubreuil prize of the Société des gens de lettres for a first novel and was among the finalists for the Prix des cinq continents de la francophonie that year.\nNot an autobiographical novel, it relates with humor the story of a young girl growing up in a poor and dysfunctional family in Saint-Benoît.\nIn 2023, Bélem published her second novel Le fruit le plus rare ou la vie d'Edmond Albius (translated title: The Rarest Fruit, or the Life of Edmond Albius), both a fictionalized historical biography of horticulturist Edmond Albius and an adventure novel. Albius's novel technique revolutionized the cultivation of vanilla by making it possible to profitably grow Vanilla planifolia beyond its native habitat in Latin America.\n\n\n== Works ==\nBélem, Gaëlle (2022).

        "content": "The Devil on Trial is a 2023 Netflix horror documentary exploring the case of Arne Cheyenne Johnson. During the trial, Johnson's attorney attempted to use \"Demonic possession\" as a defense, but presiding Judge Robert Callahan rejected that argument.The film is rated TV-MA and is 81 minutes in length.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe story revolves around the murder following the alleged possession of Arne Cheyenne Johnson. Using a combination of reenactments, home videos, and firsthand accounts, The Devil on Trial investigates the 1981 case. It was the first and only time the defense attorney in a U.S. murder trial attempted to use \"demonic possession\" as a reason for acquittal.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nCarlo Adamo as Father Dennis\nHannah Mae Beatty as Debbie Glatzel\nDavid Glatzel as himself\nAlan Glatzel as himself\nCarl Glatzel as himself\nArne Cheyenne Johnson as himself\nFoster Hamilton\nSusannah Spearin\nAdam Hunt\nRaine Van Elsacker\n\n\n== Production ==\nDirected and written by Chris Holt, the film's production team includes line producer Dominik Danielewicz, co-executive producer Amy Lee-Jones, and executive producers Julia Nottingham and Sam Starbuck. The music was composed by Tom Howe, with Brendan McGinty serving as the director of photography.Production began in October 2021 and wrapped in May 2023, with Dorothy Street Pictures listed as the production company.Dorothy Street Pictures worked with Make Productions, a UK company, to help retouch the Polaroid images relied on in the film. AI software was used to increase resolution.\n\n\n=== Sominex ===\nIncluded in the interviews with Carl Glatzel is the concern that their mother had been drugging them with Sominex on a regular basis, by putting it into their evening meals. Newsweek asked the medical director of UCI Health Sleep Medicine Services about the possibility that Sominex could be an explanation for the alleged possession, only to be told that medicines containing diphenhydramine hydrochloride are only meant for short term use, and that there are no studies on potential long-term effects.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe Devil on Trial was released on Netflix on October 17, 2023.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe New York Times stated the content was superficial and inconclusive, with the material having been 'mined' for \"lurid titillation\". The Daily Beast commented that the recordings of David Glatzel's alleged possession, obtained via microphones placed by the Warrens at the time, sounded \"like a young kid straining to say wildly profane things.\" A Good Movie to Watch stated that Netflix \"should try harder\".The Decider suggested viewers \"skip it\", stating that the film spends a lot of time indicating that there may be some basis to the claim of possession before focusing on the eldest of the Glatzel siblings, Carl, who believed otherwise. Common Sense Media asserted that the film would engender debates on \"the world of the unknown\".The GATE mentions that the film left them feeling empty and expressed disappointment that Carl Glatzel's statements weren't more thoroughly incorporated in the presentation of the case, describing the film as \"basic\" and saying that it didn't capture their attention.The Diamondback review is very positive, stating that the presentation left them conflicted as to whether the possession happened, but that it was very entertaining. The Daily Campus shares the sentiment, giving the documentary a 4.5/5.Screen Rant points out that the documentary presents the Warrens as legitimate, which they say detracts from the documentary's impact. They also point out that The Devil on Trial is far from the first documentary on the subject. /Film counters this, acknowledging that the Warrens are not given the same positive press that they receive in The Conjuring franchise, while acknowledging that there is concern over the presentation of the possession in the audio tapes.A majority of audience reviews on Rotten Tomatoes are critical of the Warrens, with some saying outright that David acted in a way contrary to any indication of possession. IMDb viewers mostly rated the film between five and seven stars. Film Affinity viewers gave a similar average rating to IMDb.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTrial of Arne Cheyenne Johnson\nExorcism\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Netflix page",

        "content": "George Lawson (23 August 1831 – 12 October 1903) was an English ophthalmic surgeon.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLawson was born in London on 23 August 1831. He was the second son of William Lawson of the firm of Trower, Trower and Lawson, wine merchants, of the City of London, by his wife Anne Norton. After education at the Blackheath proprietary school, he entered King's College Hospital in 1848. Admitted M.R.C.S. in 1852, he served for a year as house surgeon to Sir William Fergusson. In 1852 he became a licentiate in midwifery of the College of Surgeons and licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries. Early in 1854 Lawson entered the army as an assistant surgeon, and in March of that year he left England with the first draft of troops for Malta. On the outbreak of the Crimean war he was detailed for duty at Varna with the third division under General Sir Richard England; from Varna he went to the Crimea and saw the first shot fired at Bulganak. He was present at the battles of Alma and Inkerman and was sent to Balaclava about the middle of January 1855. He had a severe attack of typhus fever in May 1855, followed by complete paraplegia. Although he had been gazetted assistant surgeon to the third battalion of the rifle brigade he was invalided home and at the end of the war he resigned his commission.\nLawson then decided to practise in London. Elected F.R.C.S. in 1857, he settled at 63 Park Street, Grosvenor Square, and turned his attention more especially to ophthalmic surgery, probably at the suggestion of Sir William Bowman, who had been assistant surgeon at King's College Hospital whilst Lawson acted as house surgeon. Becoming clinical assistant to Bowman at the Royal London Ophthalmic Hospital, Moorfields, he was in 1862 elected surgeon to the hospital on the retirement of Alfred Poland, was appointed full surgeon in 1867 and consulting surgeon in 1891. He held the post of surgeon to the Great Northern Hospital for a short time. To the Middlesex Hospital he was elected assistant surgeon in 1863, surgeon in 1871, lecturer on surgery in 1878, and consulting surgeon in 1896. He served as a member of the council of the College of Surgeons from 1884 to 1892, and in 1886 was appointed surgeon-oculist to Queen Victoria. He died in London on 12 October 1903, and was buried at Hildenborough, Kent. He married, on 5 March 1863, Mary, daughter of William Thomson, of the Indian medical service, by whom he had seven sons.\nLawson practised ophthalmic surgery as a part of general surgery and was little affected by the tendency towards specialism which completely divorced the two subjects before his death.\nHis works are: \n\n‘Injuries of the Eye, Orbit and Eyelids; their immediate and remote effects,’ 1867.\n‘Diseases and Injuries of the Eye; their medical and surgical treatment,’ 1869; 6th edit. 1903.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Power, D'Arcy (1912). \"Lawson, George\".

        "content": "Harold Clark Malchow Jr. (November 4, 1951 – March 21, 2024) was an American political consultant, securities lawyer, and author. During his consulting career, he worked for every Democratic presidential nominee from 1988 through 2004, over 30 senatorial campaigns, 20 gubernatorial campaigns, and multiple organizations. He specialized in \"direct voter contact\" mailing, a form of campaigning. Malchow is considered a pioneer of microtargeting voters with data for campaigns.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHarold Clark Malchow Jr. was born on November 4, 1951, in Gulfport, Mississippi, to Mary Clark Hewes and Harold Clark Malchow. His mother, a Republican economist and professor, was deeply upset when Malchow's ninth-grade class was desegregated. His father was an environmental engineer father, and Malchow's paternal grandfather was Harold C. Malchow.Malchow graduated from Gulfport High School in 1969 and Millsaps College with a degree in political science in 1973. He received a Juris Doctor degree from University of the Pacific's McGeorge School of Law in 1981 and passed the The Mississippi Bar the same year. At University of the Pacific, he was the vice president of its student bar association and associate editor of a law journal.Early in 1987, Malchow was arrested with two other Americans in a Peru international airport, for being accused by a customs agent for possessing cocaine. They were alleged by a customs agent to have paper towels soaked in liquid cocaine in one of the other American's luggage; Malchow was alleged to have put cocaine in an arm cast he was wearing. Police said the three, detained while preparing to board on a plane to Holland, were not jailed or formally charged.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMalchow's political involvement began in college, and led a few unsuccessful campaigns before a successful one with Al Gore. He worked for multiple organizations, including the United Auto Workers, the Democratic National Committee, the AFL-CIO, Sierra Club, and EMILY's List. He helped found the Analyst Institute with Michael Podhorzer in 2007, and created a consulting firm, MSHC Partners.\n\n\n=== Early career (1970–1990) ===\nWhile attending Millsaps College, Malchow joined the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party which challenged the Democratic Party to resist the establishment segregationists. He also organized anti-Vietnam rallies and was a left-leaning columnist for the school's paper. Malchow worked on Charles Evers' unsuccessful 1971 gubernatorial bid as well.Malchow briefly worked as a securities lawyer, and worked at a law firm in Jackson, Mississippi, but left after realizing how boring writing contracts defending against financial fraud was compared to devising schemes to do them.He volunteered to work with Mississippi First, a progressive nonprofit founded in 1982 backing Mississippi governor William F. Winter's reforms, which stalled in the stage legislature. Malchow was the head of Mississippi First's fundraising, where he requested donor lists from the previous living governors, and manually entered every name into an Apple II. The fundraising brought in $100,000, enabling the effort to enact Winter's education laws.Following graduation, he worked running campaigns, but none were successful until running Al Gore's 1984 Senate campaign. Malchow was hired at the Tennessee Democratic Party as a temporary executive secretary in late 1983, before becoming Gore's campaign manager. Following the campaign, he moved to Washington, D.C. where he was often asked to assist in fundraising through the mail. Malchow devised solicitations that could be mailed to readers of particular magazines and donors to causes, saying that they \"had to be a four-page letter, and it had to go in an envelope\" to be effective.\n\n\n=== Later career (1990–2010) ===\nMSHC Partners, his consulting firm, handled political mail for 30 senators' and 20 governors' campaigns. It did so for both Bill Clinton's and John Kerry's campaigns. During Clinton's reelection, one out of every dollar raised by the Democratic National Committee went to MSHC Partners.In the mid-90s, he began making use of consumer databases with useful information on voters. Microtargeting of people with demographic groups, individual characteristics, and geographic areas, are now widely used in campaigns.But in 2010, he shut down MSHC Partners after the 2010 United States elections, which surprised his colleagues and the firm's employees and clients. In an email he wrote to them, he said that \"advertising has become not just more negative but more vicious and personal. ... I don’t say all this to criticize anyone. ... I just no longer want to do this work.\"\n\n\n=== Semi-retirement (2010–2024) ===\nThough he shut down MSHC Partners, Malchow continued to work with the Analyst Institute and The Voter Participation Center. He moved from Arlington, Virginia, to Santa Fe, New Mexico. Starting in May 2014 and ending in December 2016, Malchow was the president of the International Dyslexia Association.\n\n\n== Diagnosis and death ==\nMalchow's mother began suffering from early onset dementia, so Malchow took a genetic test in 1987 which found him likely to develop Alzheimer's. At the time, he was around 35, and vowed to take his life if he developed symptoms. Malchow would regularly be tested for symptoms. A 2019 brainwave scan showed evidence of an emerging dementia, and was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. He adopted a diet and regular exercise in hopes that it would stave off its effects. The next year, though, he started showing concrete symptoms, forgetting passwords and movies or TV he watched.Despite New Mexico permitting assisted suicide, the state requires that it be for terminally ill patients with a prognosis of only a few months. Alzheimer's does not fit that requirement. In September 2023, Malchow contacted the nonprofit assisted death advocacy group Dignitas, and scheduled his death. The date was scheduled around when he would finish his final book.Malchow died via assisted suicide in Zürich, Switzerland, on March 21, 2024, at the age of 72.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nThe New Political Targeting. 2003.

        "content": "Kissima Doukara was a Malian statesman who served as the Minister of Defense and Internal Security during the regime of Moussa Traoré. He was known for his corruption and tight grip on Malian security during his tenure, and was ousted by Moussa Traoré in 1978.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nDoukara was born to a Soninke family in 1934 in the village of Wolocoro, near Mourdiah, French Sudan. Doukara participated in the 1968 Malian coup d'état against Modibo Keïta, and was a founding member of the Military Committee for National Liberation. In 1970, he became Mali's Minister of Defense and Internal Security. Doukara helped arrest dissidents to the Military Committee, such as arresting Yoro Diakité and Malik Diallo in 1970.\nDoukara was put in charge of alleviating a famine caused by a drought in 1974. Like many other Malian officials, he embezzled huge sums of money from foreign aid funds. Around this same time, a border dispute with Upper Volta led to the strengthening of the Malian army and Doukara's political position. Doukara and Tiécoro Bagayoko were the most influential members of the Military Committee, and notorious for their abuses. Both Doukara and Bagayoko opposed Traore's plan for civilian rule, which included the establishment of the Democratic Union of the Malian People in 1976. Traore attempted to oust Doukara, citing corruption, in 1978. Other corrupt members of the committee opposed Traore, and Doukara and Bagayoko were instead charged with planning a coup and assassination of Traore.\nDoukara, Bagayoko, and Public Works Minister Karim Dembele were arrested by Traore in February 1978. Foreign Minister Charles Samba Sissoko, who had been Doukara and allies' pick for Traore's replacement, was arrested in March. Doukara was sentenced to death for political crimes, including embezzling nine million dollars in funds, but this was commuted to a life sentence by the Supreme Court in 1979.\nDoukara and Bagayoko were sentenced to the salt mines in Taoudenni, and were tortured to death in 1983. On August 19, 1983, Doukara was personally isolated into a room, where Malian soldiers took turns beating him. He was reportedly unfazed, and when he did not die by torture, he was killed through \"infallible means.\" Doukara's body was discovered on September 19 by Captain Mamadou Belco N'Diaye, and he was transported by wheelbarrow into an small open grave.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "You'll Never Know (French: Tu ne sauras jamais) is a Canadian drama film, directed by Robin Aubert and released in 2023. The film stars Martin Naud as Paul Vincent, an elderly man confined to his room in a nursing home during the COVID-19 pandemic who is determined to do everything in his power to see the woman he loves, who is similarly confined in her own room, once more before he dies.\nThe film was the first-ever acting role for Naud, an 88-year-old retired fire investigator from Repentigny, Quebec. Aubert and Julie Roy had originally written the screenplay with actor Jean Lapointe in mind for the role, but after he was unable to work on the film due to his declining health and death in 2022, they instead chose to cast a non-professional actor, and Naud auditioned for the role after his daughter Guylaine told him that she had heard about a casting call.\nThe film's cast also includes Sarah Keita, Jean-Marie Lapointe, Marie-Hélène Brousseau, Louise Gougeon and Guillaume Baillargeon.\nThe film premiered in November 2023 at the Cinemania film festival, before opening commercially in March 2024.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nYou'll Never Know at IMDb",

        "content": "Azerbaijan has had a deliberate policy of forced assimilation of ethnic minorities since Soviet times (Azerbaijan SSR) and up to the present. Non-Turkic peoples, such as Talyshis, Lezgins, Tats and others have been subjected to forced Azerbaijanization (Turkification).\nThe policy was carried out by: \n\nproclaiming Muslim peoples of Azerbaijan SSR as ethnic groups of the Azerbaijani people\nmanipulating population censuses\nconstantly emphasizing on a commonality of history and closeness of cultures, including in academic publications.\n\n\n== Soviet period ==\nIn the USSR, Azerbaijanis were considered the \"titular nation\" and their name coincided with the name of the union republic — the Azerbaijani SSR. All other peoples (Talysh, Tats, Lezgins, Georgian-Ingilois and others) on its territory were considered \"nontitular minorities\". Although at the all-Union and republic levels \"non-titular\" peoples had equal rights with \"titular\" Azerbaijanis, in practice they were not treated equally. Over time, the power disbalance between \"titular\" Azerbaijanis and non-titular nationalities became more and more pronounced. Azerbaijanis became the main beneficiaries of the nativization policies and practices in the republic. Following the 1930s, there was a heightened exacerbation of this situation concerning non-titular minorities of Azerbaijan, who experienced restricted or absent access to equivalent national rights, including support for national culture, facilitation of native language advancement, etc. \"Non-titular\" ethnic groups encountered escalating assimilatory pressures to identify as part of the \"titular\" Azerbaijani nationality.\nAzerbaijani leadership had been pursuiting a policy of discrimitation toward ethnic minorities before the disintegration of USSR, and after it.\nAccording to Krista Goff, in order to justify the assimilation policy regarding non-titular minorities, Azerbaijani officials and scholars increasingly began to talk from the 1950s about the “purportedly ancient, local origins of the Azeri nation,” writing ethnic minorities into its history. Thus, emphasizing that the Talysh and other peoples of the Azerbaijan SSR “descended from the same ancient population” as the Azerbaijanis (Azerbaijani Turks), they tried to pass off \"the formation of the Azeri-defined Soviet Azerbaijani people\" as a \"natural, centuries-long process rather than the result of forced assimilation, as some minorities claimed.\"\n\n\n=== Peoples ===\n\n\n==== Talysh ====\n\nTalysh people are an indigenous people of the Talish region. They are an Iranian ethnic group.\nTalyshis suffered from forced assimilation in Azerbaijan SSR. In the 1950s, they experienced assimilatory politics with erasure of their nationality category from the public sphere.\nThe 1939 census stated that Talysh people constituted the fifth largest national community in Azerbaijan SSR, following Azeris, Russians, Armenians, and Lezgins, numbering 87,510 people. However, the 1959 census counted only 85 individuals of Talysh nationality in Azerbaijan. The official explanation of the authorities for the almost complete disappearance of thousands of the Talyshes in this census was that \"Talyshes voluntarily and en masse self-identified as Azeri to census workers\". In her book, Krista Goff shows through documentary evidence that the Central Statistical Administration in Moscow had plans to include a Talysh nationality category in the 1959 census, but this category was excluded during the process of collecting and reporting the census in Azerbaijan itself.\nThe leadership of the Azerbaijan SSR used the manipulated census data in Soviet ethnography, creating a narrative of the “voluntary and complete assimilation” of the Talysh people, and that it occurred “naturally over time rather than from artificial manipulations of minority communities and identifications\". Subsequently, there followed the production of a large amount of encyclopedic, ethnographic, linguistic, historical-geographical and other material that developed and reproduced narratives designed to justify the national “erasure” of the Talyshis and strengthen the official myth of their “voluntary assimilation.” Soviet ethnographers emphasized their common features in culture and life with the Azerbaijanis and presented the “assimilation” of the Iranian-speaking Talysh by the Turkic-speaking Azerbaijanis as an “impressive achievement” of the Soviet state, “ethnohistorical progress.” So, for example, the Great Soviet Encyclopedia began to say that “in the USSR, the Talysh almost merged with the Azerbaijanis, who are very close in material and spiritual culture, and therefore were not identified in the 1970 census”.\nThis assimilation policy put great social, political and economic pressure on the Talyshis and on their daily life, encouraging them to “merge” with the \"titular\" Azerbaijani nation. For example, Talyshis could not register as representatives of Talysh nationality in official documents, and parents could not enroll their children in schools teaching in the Talysh language. Some Talysh petitioned the authorities for their rights to be identified as Talysh in government documents, but all these requests were rejected by the authorities until 1989. Others, finding no other way out, accepted Azerbaijani identification in order to avoid discrimination in everyday life, for example, when applying for a job. Krista Goff also cites stories of Talysh who admitted that due to the stigmatization of their nationality, the lack of schools, books and other resources for the Talyshis of Azerbaijan, as well as the lack of any preferences for being a Talyshi, they preferred the Azerbaijani self-identification and the Azerbaijani language, even fearing that their children could face discrimination if they speak Azerbaijani with a Talysh accent. Representatives of the Talysh people often internalized these assimilation narratives about themselves that were told to them and which they found in encyclopedias, articles and other printed material.\nFrom 1960 to 1989, the Talysh were not included in the censuses as a separate ethnic group, as they were considered part of the Azerbaijanis (Azerbaijani Turks).\nIn 1978, a part of the Talysh addressed the Central Statistical Office in Moscow and the Pravda newspaper with collective complaints that the census workers refused to register them as Talysh in the upcoming 1979 census. To which they received a response letter from the head of the Department of the All-Union Census A. A. Isupov, saying that the category of Talysh nationality would not be included in the census, because, Isupov wrote, referring to the ethnographic report on the assimilation of the Talysh, the Talysh are now Azerbaijanis.\nIn her book, Krista Goff provides interviews with some Talyshis: \"During these censuses [from 1959 to 1979] no one asked us about our nationality or self-identification. The census workers sat in the regional or village office and filled in the national composition of the population ahead of time based on orders from above. Then they asked us to fill in the other lines.\" Respondents also shared with Goff stories about how census takers recorded them as “Azerbaijanis” when they presented themselves as Talyshi, and denied the very existence of Talysh nationality; In addition, when collecting information for the census, workers avoided the categories of native language and nationality. During the preparation of materials for the 1970 population census, some ethnographers and cartographers in Moscow expressed doubts about the census data, claiming that the Azerbaijani census authorities \"artificially assimilated\" the Talyshis in order to \"portray their region as more ethnically homogeneous\" and Azerbaijanis to be \"more consolidated\", than in reality.\nOnly in 1989, the Talysh nationality was returned to the census, immediately counting 21,196 Talyshes.\nAccording to Victor Schnirelmann, since during the Soviet years the authorities subjected the Talyshis to “reinforced Azerbaijanization,” this created separatist sentiments among them. This led to the Talyshis “rebelling” after the collapse of the USSR, proclaiming Talysh-Mughan Autonomous Republic.\n\n\n==== Tats ====\nTat people are an indigenous people in the Caucasus. They are an Iranian ethnic group.\nTats were subjected to forced assimilation in Azerbaijan SSR.\n\n\n==== Georgian-Ingilois ====\nAccording to Krista Goff, \"Muslim Georgian-Ingilois in Soviet Azerbaijan experienced significant pressure to identify as part of the titular Azerbaijani nation. Although most ethnographers continued to categorize Christian Georgian-Ingilois as Georgian, Muslim Georgian-Ingilois at best were considered an ethnographic group of the Georgian nation and registered as Azerbaijani in Soviet passports and censuses\".\nIn 1962 anonymous group of Georgian-Ingilois of the Azerbaijan SSR petitioned Nikita Khrushchev about experienced violations of their rights and begged him to improve their condition, writing \"We love the languages of all republics of our Soviet Union and their culture […] why not love our language and our culture\"?\n\n\n==== Kurds ====\n\nAt the beginning of the USSR, Kurds in Azerbaijan constituted a majority in its western regions neighboring Armenia. Most of them were farmers and urban traders, and unlike the Shia Azerbaijanis, they were Sunni. Unlike the city of Ganja (later Kirovabad), where the Kurds were almost fully assimilated, the area that would later be formed in the Kurdistan Uezd (known to the Kurds as Red Kurdistan, Kurdish: Kurdistana sor) was almost entirely Kurdish. On July 4, 1923, Moscow decreed the Kurdish region with the main city of Lachin to become part of the Azerbaijan SSR. Nagorno-Karabakh and the Nakhichevan enclave, both with noticeable Kurdish minorities, were also made parts of the Azerbaijan SSR.\nIn 1923  the Central Committee established the Kurdistan Uezd within Azerbaijan with Lachin city as its capital, as well as a Kurdish governing body. There were founded Kurdish schools and a teacher's training college at Shusha.  Books in Kurdish language were published, with a political periodical Sovyet Kurdustan (\"Soviet Kurdistan\"). Also Kurdish-language broadcasting existed. But self-government did not last long, and in 1929 the Azerbaijani government reduced Red Kurdistan from an uyezd to an okrug, the lowest territorial unit for non-Russian nationalities.\nUnder Stalin the policy of the authorities of the Azerbaijan SSR towards the Kurds was similar to that of Turkey. They were subjected to forced assimilation with manipulation of their population figures, settlement of non-Kurds in predominantly Kurdish areas, publication suppression and abolishment of Kurdish as a language of instruction in schools. Also, in 1937, they experienced forced deportation to Kazakhstan, with Azerbaijanis settling their land. As with many others (see for example Azerbaijanization of Nizami), Kurdish historical figures such as Sharafkhan Bidlisi, Ehmedê Xanî and the whole Shaddadid dynasty were declared Azerbaijanis. Kurds with retained \"Kurdish\" nationality in their internal passports, unlike those with \"Azerbaijani\" nationality, had no chance to find any employment. As late as the 1960s the Kurdish department of the Institute of Oriental Studies at Baku was abolished. The political periodical Sovyet Kurdustan (\"Soviet Kurdistan\") although continued to be published in the 1930s, was transferred from Kurdish language to a Turkish with an alphabet made up of Cyrillic and Roman letters and provided coverage of unrelated to Kurds issues.\nAccording to Ismet Cheriff Vanly, Soviet statistics on Kurds is unreliable. In 1921 census counted 32 780 Kurds in Azerbaijan, in 1926 — 41 000, in 1939 — 6 000, in 1959 — 1 500, in 1970 — 5 000. In 1979 there were no Kurds recorded in Azerbaijan SSR. And then in 1989 — 13 000 Kurds. When Soviet Kurds asked the authorities about the “disappearance of the Kurds” (Kurdish: windabûna Kurdan), the official explanation was that “they had assimilated for objective reasons” because they were Muslims like the Azerbaijanis. Vanly points out that in other Muslim countries where Kurds live, such as Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran, this has not been the case. Furthermore, in 1988 about 10 000 of the \"lost\" Azerbaijani Kurds returned their passports to Moscow with requests that the nationality column be changed from \"Azerbaijani\" to \"Kurdish\". With regard to the figures of 1926, 1939 and 1959 official cencuces, scholar Alexandre Bennigsen remarkes that \"most Soviet Kurdologists regard these as inadequate\" and quotes an estimate by Soviet Kurdologist Tatyana Aristova of 160 000 Kurds in 1954. Vanly gives his estimate of 180 000 Kurds in the Azerbaijan SSR in 1990.\nIn Turkmenistan the Kurds also were subjected to an active assimilation campaign with no facilities for education in Kurdish language. They also participated in efforts to reobtain their right to be recognized as a separate nationality.\nIn May 20–21, 1988, on a demonstration by Kurds that took place in Moscow, among others were present groups from Azerbaijan SSR. The demonstrators demanded that the central government provide security of daily Kurdish existence and the restoration of Kurdistan as an autonomous region within Azerbaijan.\n\n\n==== Lezgins and Avars ====\nLezgins and Avars live in northern Azerbaijan.\nThe policy towards Lezgins and Avars was similar as towards the Talyshis. They were forced to register as \"ethnic Azerbaijanis\", encountering serious restrictions on their native languages and cultures. During Soviet times, ethnic Azerbaijanis actively settled in the north of the country, starting their assimilation.\n\n\n==== Armenians ====\nArmenians also experienced discriminatory practices. But despite facing constraints on their national-cultural development and political influence, Armenians always maintained a recognized status of their nationality in Soviet Azerbaijan, owing to factors such as the size of their population, the special status of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, and the presence of the neighboring Armenian SSR. Unlike other ethnic groups within the republic, many Armenians in Azerbaijan enjoyed relatively firm access to native-language educational resources, schools, newspapers, radio broadcasts, and other cultural support.\n\n\n=== Study problems ===\nAccording to Krista Goff, the history of the \"non-titular\" peoples of the Soviet republics, including Azerbaijan, has received little attention. Referring to Azerbaijani researcher Irada Kasumova, Goff writes: The prime reason for this is not just ideological; it is a question of source base availability, political censorship, and methodology. Many nontitular minority communities were not bureaucratically recognized after the 1930s, making them much harder to trace in Soviet archives. There are also significant gaps in history writing and ethnographies of nontitular minorities because of repressive state practices. During the Great Terror some scholars from these communities, as well as some who studied them, were intentionally targeted, leading not only to an erasure of existing knowledge, but also indicating to all who survived that the study of sub-republic minorities was potentially dangerous. Thus, lacking robust narratives of post–World War II nationality politics and nontitular histories, Soviet historiography mostly leapfrogs over decades of evolving practices, theories, and experiences in this arena, drawing tenuous connections between the 1930s and 1990s and overlooking the formative postwar decades that gave rise to significant national movements.\nIn the late 1930s, the Soviet regime centralized population categorization around dominant nationalities, strongly reducing national support structures for \"non-titular\" nationalities such as local councils (soviets), schools, presses, etc. This led to a decline in bureaucratic processes that previously documented these minorities, pushing their identities further to the periphery. The decreasing archival visibility of \"non-titular\" minorities mirrored the state's transition from preservation to assimilation policies towards them. Consequently, it presents significant practical and conceptual obstacles for archival research.\nAccording to Irada Kasumova, the 1936–1937 repression that targeted minority cultural leaders and scholars who studied ethnic minorities in Azerbaijan SSR (such as A. Bukshpan, who studied Kurds in the early 1930s) suppressed further work in the field.\nIn modern Azerbaijan, different archive directors and staff members conveyed to Goff that \"[she] was wasting [her] time and theirs because it was anachronistic to study national minorities after the 1930s\". Her ability to access archives was harshly restricted due to the persisting Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and Azerbaijan's historical context of autonomist and separatist movements. Because she studied ethnic minorities, she often faced accusations that she was an \"Armenian spy\" or \"intended to commit treason or sow separatism.\" Additionally, institutional limitations were evident, with archivists informing her that files ordered by her were either inaccessible or had been destroyed (including bonfiring). Also, the director of  the former Communist Party archive in Baku declared her a \"separatist\" in the presence of archival personnel and revoked her access pass to the facility. According to her, \"these limitations of source access and institutional support do not just circumscribe the histories that are available to us; they also help explain why nontitular minorities are underrepresented in the historical record as well as why so many want to keep it that way today.\" Personal interviews with representatives of ethnic minorities in the areas where they live are complicated by an atmosphere of fear of state surveillance and of being put in jail. Goff writes that some people were questioned by the police or state officials simply because they invited to them a foreigner (that is her).\n\n\n=== Evaluation ===\nAccording to researchers, “erasing” peoples from censuses was one of the main ways to increase the “titular” Azerbaijani majority in the republic and homogenize it.\n\nAnswering a question about resolving the national issue in Azerbaijan, Neymat Panakhly said: The present policy of Turkization in Azerbaijan is hostile to the Turkic world, it is directed at keeping the Turkic people in bondage and is an imperial policy. There was a time when people of various ethnic groups living in Azerbaijan were registered as Azerbaijanis. The aim was to obliterate the specific traits of these ethnic groups and the hardest hit were the Turkic peoples. In today’s Azerbaijan, a Kurd knows that he is a Kurd, a Talysh that he is a Talysh, a Lezgin that he is a Lezgin, a Tat that he is a Tat; even if the ethnic group consists of five people. The Azerbaijanis, however, have again been put in an unenviable position. All and sundry are speaking on television and asking: ‘Which is correct—Turkic or Azerbaijani?’. But there must be a limit to ignorance, dishonesty and indecency! Azerbaijan is a territorial-geographic name. How can ‘Azerbaijani’ be a nationality? Only because the policy of the state had been to declare it as such. The entry for nationality must be determined according to one’s choice—Turk, Talysh, Lezgin, Kurd, Russian, Jew, etc. Why does it bother other people when we speak of ‘the Turkic language?’ Do you need an interpreter when you are talking with Turks from Turkey? I speak Turkic.\nAccording to Krista Goff, \"a popular refusal to acknowledge assimilatory and discriminatory practices in Azerbaijan has had many unintended effects, including masking the ways in which past experiences and practices continue to shape its present.\"\n\n\n== Modern period ==\nAccording to Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization, ethnic minorities in modern Azerbaijan are subject to forced assimilation, including the Talyshis and Lezgins. Minority Rights Group International also expresses concern about the forced assimilation of Lezgins in Azerbaijan.\nAccording to Christina Bratt Paulston and Donald Peckham, \"[g]enerally there is a prevailing policy of forceful assimilation of all minorities, including the Talysh, Tat, Kurds and Lezgins\" and \"[i]n Azerbaijan there is a situation of total linguistic, cultural and political oppression and forced assimilation.\"\nAccording to Akbar Ahmed, after the country gained independence in 1991, Lezgins and Avars of Azerbaijan \"became subjected to Ataturk-style ethnic nationalism by the Azeri-dominated center.\" The Lezgin and Avar tribes, affected by the division of their clans and depletion of their herds due to the establishment of the Azerbaijan-Russia border, were often accused of collaboration with Armenia during Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Ethnic Azerbaijani resettlement in the northern Azerbaijan continued in the 1990s, when the government settled over 100,000 Azerbaijani refugees into the Lezgin lands, meanwhile forcibly conscripting a great number of Lezgins to fight in the war. This spurred the rise of a Lezgin nationalist movement led by the Sadval (meaning in Lezgin “Unity”). The Azerbaijani government blamed Sadval for the 1994 Baku Metro bombings with fourteen dead. In 1996 Ali Antsukhskiy, one of the most prominent Avar leaders, was assassinated in Baku, while in 2002, Avar guerrilla leader Haji Magomedov was killed by Azerbaijani security forces. In 2008, an Avar advocacy group appealed with an open letter to the President of Dagestan (who was an Avar himself), urging intervention to halt what they termed as \"physical and moral genocide\" against Avars in Azerbaijan. They pointed out the predominance of ethnic Azerbaijani officials in Avar-populated areas, accusing them to \"organize the destruction of the entire non-Azerbaijani material heritage and raze to the ground anything that may be reminiscent of the presence of other ethnic groups\".\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nAhmed, Akbar (2013).

        "content": "Mark Bernstein is one of the first publishers of electronic literature in the United States.\nAs chief scientist and founder at Eastgate Systems, Bernstein designs tools for interlinked, hypertextual writing, such as StorySpace and Tinderbox.\n\n\n== Education and early life ==\nBernstein graduated from Swathmore College and got his Ph.D. in physical chemistry from Harvardin 1983. Bernstein was in college in 1976 when he met Ted Nelson, which sparked his interest in hypertext and non-linear writing.\n\n\n== Hypertext community ==\nBernstein has been a part of ACM Hypertext Conferences in the Program Committee and as the program co-chair in 1996 and 1997. He has also been a chair on Web Sci.\n\n\n== Software and works ==\n\n\n=== Tools ===\nMark Bernstein created and worked on tools to \"harness the power of the link.\"The first system Mark Bernstein created was Hypergate which ran on HyperCard. After seeing Storyspace, first created by Michael Joyce, Jay David Bolter, and John B. Smith, he helped develop the user interface and then programmed this tool for many operating platforms. Michael Joyce wrote afternoon: a story  as one of the first works for StorySpace.   \nAfter developing StorySpace, Mark Bernstein created Tinderbox.\n\n\n=== Critical works ===\nBernstein's seminal work, Patterns of hypertext, May 1998 for the UK Conference on Hypertext describes structural hypertext patterns used in early Eastgate works such as True North by Stephanie Strickland and Patchwork Girl by Shelley Jackson. He followed this the next year with Structural patterns and hypertext Rhetoric, which explains navigational anxiety and the evolution of literary hypertexts. His work on pattern recognition in hypertext continued with Trends, fashions, patterns, norms, conventions, and hypertext too in 2001.\nBernstein explored hypertext tools such as Card Shark and Thespis (2001), Brown University's Cave (2009).\n\n\n=== Editing ===\nMark Bernstein and Diane Greco edited the anthology, Reading Hypertext (2011), which, as Marvin Hobson explains \"could introduce graduate students to the beauty and complexity involved in reading and writing hypertext literature.\"\n\n\n=== Creative works ===\nWith Eric Sweeney, Mark Bernstein wrote an early non-fiction hypertext, The Election of 1912.\n\n\n== Lectures and keynotes ==\nBernstein has been a major keynote speaker at many conferences, including:\n\nWhere are the Hypertexts? 1999 ACM Hypertext Conference\nBlog Talk 2.0 in 2004\nIntimate Information: Organic hypertext structure and incremental formalization for everyone's everyday tasks. 2006\n1st International Conference on Web Studies at Toluca, Mexico in 2010\nThe Futures of Digital Studies 2010, the University of Florida\nHypertext 2010 in Toronto.\nICIDS2020 KEYNOTE BY MARK BERNSTEIN\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Our Saviour Lutheran Church in Baltimore, Maryland, is affiliated with the Southeastern District of the Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod. The building is noted as one of the first in America to combine the architecture of the Early English and Norman periods and is prominently located at 3301 The Alameda.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe congregation of Our Saviour Lutheran Church purchased its present site at 33rd Street and The Alameda from the Frank Novak Realty Company in 1919 and in 1920 constructed a wood frame chapel that seated 200. On August 8, 1921, a fire burned the rear half of the chapel, destroying the pipe organ that the congregation had brought with them from their former home on E. Fairmount Avenue in Baltimore.\nPlans to have architect J.A. Dempwork design a church were abandoned with the arrival of Pastor Rev. Adolph John Stiemke in 1924; he guided the congregation toward building a stone church, and hired the architecture firm of Frohman, Robb, and Little—the same firm that designed Washington National Cathedral. Initial sketches and preliminary plans were provided in June 1927, and Edward A. Wehr of Pittsburgh was chosen as the general contractor. Stiemke would remain as pastor until 1961.\nGround was broken on November 25, 1928 and the cornerstone for the present building was laid on August 4, 1929. Dedicated on September 7, 1930, Our Saviour Lutheran Church is still known as one of “the finest small churches in America.”  \nTwo decades after opening its new church, the congregation had grown in number and expanded its activities. It had a robust Sunday School, and in 1951 the church opened the first Sunday School class for children and young adults with intellectual disabilities. This growth required the addition of a Parish Activities Building, to contain classrooms and meeting spaces, which was designed by architect Howard G. Hall of Baltimore. The contractor was J.H. Williams and the building cost $178,360.28. It was dedicated in June 1958. On November 13, 2017 the Baltimore City Council approved Ordinance 17-0110, adding Our Saviour Lutheran Church to the “Baltimore City Landmark List: Exteriors.”  BCC Art. 6 section 4-2(1)\n\n\n=== Property ===\nThe church is located at the northeast corner of 33rd Street and The Alameda in the Ednor Gardens-Lakeside neighborhood, about 4 miles NNW from the center of Baltimore. It stands diagonally across 33rd Street from Baltimore City College, which is of similar style and stone color.\n\n\n== Architectural features ==\nOur Saviour Lutheran Church combines the architecture of the Early English and the Norman periods. It was built with the thought of permanency and incorporates a true devotional atmosphere.\nThe interior includes a chancel 20-foot (6.1 m) wide by 33 feet 7 inches (10.24 m) deep, a nave measuring 22 by 80 feet (6.7 by 24.4 m), and side aisles 11 feet (3.4 m) in width. It seats 210 in the nave proper, the side aisles seat 136 more, and there are 36 main-floor sittings on the first level of the tower. There is no west gallery. Each bay is 14-foot (4.3 m) on centers and each arch is 22 feet 6 inches (6.86 m) high to its peak. The columns are 14 feet (4.3 m) high and 24 inches (61 cm) thick, with good capitals and bases. \nThe wrought iron hardware, made by Philadelphia craftsman Samuel Yellin, is of special interest because of its excellent conformity with the architectural motif.\n\n\n=== Stained glass ===\n\nIn the years between 1949 and 1962, members of the congregation commissioned 32 stained glass windows from the Willet Stained Glass Company of Philadelphia. \nThe first three windows to be installed were those above the altar: they depict the article of faith, that both the Old and New Testaments reveal Jesus Christ as the Saviour. In 1949 they were dedicated as a memorial to four members of the congregation who died in World War II: the windows were donated by the parents of the veterans and other members of the congregation. All of the windows were designed by Marguerite Gaudin (an internationally famous stained-glass designer at Willet Studios). Among Gaudin's other notable design achievements were windows for the National Presbyterian Church and Chapel in Washington, D.C., the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City, and Grace Episcopal Cathedral in San Francisco.\nMost of the church's windows depict two or three related scenes from the Old or New Testaments; others contain illustrations of the various Creeds of the Church or its hymns, e.g., \"Te Deum.\" \n\n\n=== Chancel ===\n\nThe furnishings in the chancel are particularly harmonious because the pipe organ, altar, pulpit, communion rail, hymn boards, and lectern were all designed and built by M.P. Moller Organ Company of Hagerstown, MD.\nThe altar features a wooden carved reredos, which includes images of the four evangelists (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John). The reredos also holds a cross and candlesticks.\n\n\n=== Tower ===\nTypical of Norman towers, the tower at Our Saviour is substantial; it is about 72’ high and 25’ square, with one large, unvaulted arch on the west face. The tower has a short ground stage, a long second stage, a short stage at the ringer's room, and a longer belfry stage. The stone walls are 3' 6\" thick at the lower stage, 4' 9\" thick where tower and nave join, and drop back to 2' 4\" at the belfry stage.\nThe inside of the tower includes the bell chamber and a lower workshop. An arch close to 30' high opens out of the tower into the nave. There is no western gallery.\nOne authority has said that “this is but one of perhaps a scant two dozen churches in the United States where the tower happens to be of dignified mass.”  \nThe tower doorway is done in a style that is transitional from Norman to Early English\n\n\n=== Bells ===\nThe 18 bells in the tower were a gift from two members of the congregation, John and Alma Wever, in 1934. They were cast by the McShane Bell Foundry Company of Baltimore. At that time, they were the largest set of carillon bells in Maryland and the largest set cast in an American foundry.They each weigh between 500 and 3,000 pounds, and each has a lengthy inscription consisting of Bible verses and dedications. \nPlayable from the organ console, the range and equal temperament of the bells are such that all melodies can be played or transposed to come within the compass of the chime.\nIn earlier days, the bells were frequently used to greet marchers as they paraded westbound along 33rd Street toward Memorial Stadium for various sporting events. It was for a time a tradition when the Navy played games at the old Memorial Stadium to play \"Anchors Aweigh\" on the bells as the midshipmen marched down 33rd to the stadium. \n\n\n== Moller Pipe Organ ==\n\nIn 1930 the church contracted with M.P. Moller Organ Company of Hagerstown, MD, to build a two-manual pipe organ of 13 ranks (825 pipes), using pitman chests. Their Opus 5779 was delivered later that year, at a cost of $5,000.\nMoller rebuilt the organ in 1987, adding 5 ranks (317 pipes) and updating the wiring and voicing of the instrument. In 2023, the Moller console was replaced with a Viscount console that plays the Moller pipe work and 13 new computer-generated voices in a hybrid installation. The new console features 99 levels of memory, and interfaces with all 18 ranks of pipes, the 18 tower bells, and a bell toller.\n\n\n== History of the Congregation ==\nThe rich history of Our Saviour Lutheran Church's congregation dates back to March 7, 1892, when 12 active members of the then-German Immanuel Lutheran Church were granted a peaceful release to become the nucleus of a new English- speaking congregation that became known as Jackson Square Lutheran Church. When the congregation moved to its current site on The Alameda, it changed its name to the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Our Saviour. \nIn 1973, this congregation merged with another historic Lutheran congregation, St. Matthew Lutheran Church, which was located at 1901 Druid Hill Ave. St. Matthew's had been founded in 1929 by a group of African American Lutherans who moved from rural Meherrin, Virginia, to Baltimore in the first wave of the Great Migration. The new combined congregation—composed of a predominately Black parish of 110 communicants and a predominantly White parish of 325 communicants—was renamed \"Lutheran Church of Our Saviour.\" Mergers between predominantly white and a predominantly African American congregations were highly uncommon, and this melding set a precedent in both Baltimore and the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod. The congregation has a long history of being active in its community. In addition to starting the city's first Sunday School for children and young adults with disabilities in 1951, it helped develop a community health facility and child care center. Today, the congregation is still thriving and serving its community at large.\n\n\n== Civil Rights Advocacy of the Congregation ==\nOur Saviour Lutheran Church was one of eight in its neighborhood and the adjoining neighborhood of Coldsteam-Homestead- Montebello that banded together to fight \"blockbusting\" in their communities in the 1960s and 1970s—that is, when agents were \"buying properties from white people for cheap due to fears of an influx of African-Americans, and then selling to African-Americans for significantly higher prices and often with financially-predatory lending terms.\" The eight churches formed Homestead-Montebello Churches, Inc., which worked with community partners and was \"resolute in their determination to expose instances of unlawful real property schemes, and to assist those residents so victimized by seeking redress of their losses to the fullest extent of all available remedies at law.\"\nThis group of churches pooled their resources to hire Vincent Quayle, then a Jesuit seminarian, to investigate the predatory real estate practices in the area. Quayle later went on to found and become the long-running Executive Director of St. Ambrose Housing Aid Center. Thanks to the efforts of fair-housing advocates, Homestead-Montebello Churches Inc., and others, the U.S. Department of Justice initiated an investigation into the blockbusting practices in Baltimore. They were made illegal under the 1968 Civil Rights Act.\nIn October 1972, the congregation hosted a meeting for city housing officials (including Housing Commissioner Robert Embry Jr.) and neighborhood groups on the topic of racial \"steering\" practices.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n[1]\n[2]",

        "content": "Metropolitan Theodosius (Japanese: 府主教フェオドシイ, Russian: Митрополит Феодосий; secular name Basil Nagashima Shinji, Japanese: ワシリイ 永島 新二; April 3, 1935 – May 7, 1999) was primate of the Japanese Orthodox Church, the Autonomous Church of the Moscow Patriarchate, with the title: Archbishop of Tokyo, Metropolitan of All Japan.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe was born on April 3, 1935, in the Ōmiya (now in the city of Saitama), Saitama Prefecture, Japan, in a Buddhist family.While studying in elementary school, he attended the Holy Resurrection Cathedral (nikorai-dō) in Tokyo to listen to Eastern Orthodox hymns. Nagashima Shinji began to attend an educational missionary circle, and in 1952 he was baptized with the name Basil. Nagashima's father and two brothers also converted to Orthodoxy.After completing his secondary education, he was preparing to enter university, but conversion to Orthodoxy changed his views, and in 1954 he entered the newly revived Tokyo Theological Seminary. On February 5, 1958, together with other seminarians, he founded the religious magazine \"The Way\" (\"michi\"). Although the magazine ceased publication after four issues, it served as the beginning of Nagashima's writing and publishing works.\nAfter graduating from the seminary in 1958, Basil Nagashima was sent as a catechist to the church in the name of the Great Martyr Demetrius of Thessalonica in the city of Yamato. At the same time, he assumed the duties of editor of the official Japanese church newspaper Orthodox Bulletin (seikyō jihō). After that, he served as a catechist in the Kanda district church (Tokyo) for two years, and in July 1962 he was transferred to the Apostle James Church in Kagoshima City. Here he continued his catechetical ministry, often visiting the remote borders of Kyushu Island with missionary visits.\nIn 1964 Bishop Vladimir (Nagosky) ordained catechist Basil a deacon and soon a presbyter. While in Kyushu, Fr. Basil began to express a desire to become a monk, and in July 1965 Bishop Vladimir sent him to the United States for obedience to St. Tikhon's Monastery in South Canaan, Pennsylvania, where Saint Tikhon's Orthodox Theological Seminary also located. From America, the priest Basil wrote to Bishop Vladimir that he had strengthened his desire to become a monk; nevertheless, in July 1967, he was recalled to Japan and returned to serve at the church in Kagoshima City.By 1969, when the Orthodox Church in Japan was on the verge of gaining autonomy, it became necessary to elect bishops from the Japanese. On October 19, at an extraordinary meeting on this issue, two candidates were elected – Hierodeacon Seraphim (Sigrist) and priest Basil Nagashima, who, obeying the will of the Church, took vows with the name Theodosius in honor of St. Theodosius of Chernigov. On November 2, 1969, in accordance with the decision of the Bishops' Council of the Northern American Metropolis, Archimandrite Theodosius was consecrated Bishop of Kyoto. The consecration was performed by Archbishop John (Shakhovskoy) of San Francisco and Bishop Vladimir (Nagossky) of Tokyo.The structure and administrative institutions of the autonomous Church were determined at two Councils in 1970 – the annual July Council and the Extraordinary Council on November 15–16. In accordance with the Patriarchal Tomos, three dioceses were established in the Japanese Church:  Archdiocese of Tokyo, headed by the primate; the Diocese of Western Japan centered in Kyoto, headed by Bishop Theodosius, and the Diocese of Eastern Japan centered in SendaiOn February 10, 1972, Metropolitan Vladimir (Nagosky) sent a notice to the Japanese clergy about his resignation from the post of primate of the Japanese Orthodox Church, at the same time sending a petition for admission to the number of bishops of the Orthodox Church of America. He appointed Bishop Theodosius (Nagashima) of Kyoto as the locum tenens of the Church. The issue of electing a new primate turned out to be difficult: the most relevant candidate, Bishop Theodosius, has not yet gained proper authority among the clergy and believers, and therefore the Japanese leadership of the Church, headed by Fr. Basil Takeoka began to openly speak out against the election of a new primate, offering to grant all powers to the Metropolitan Council.The issue of replacing the see of Tokyo was resolved at an extraordinary Council on March 19, 1972. In addition to the three bishops of the Japanese Church, Archbishop Juvenal (Poyarkov), Deputy Chairman of the DECR, attended it, whose main task was to convince the Japanese clergy that the existence of the Church without a ruling bishop did not comply with canonical rules and, therefore, would not be approved by the Moscow Patriarchate. Metropolitan Vladimir also stressed the need to elect a successor, expressing the opinion that for the further development of the Church, turning it into a \"truly Japanese\" one, it is necessary to have a Japanese primate, he recommended Bishop Theodosius to the council. Archbishop Juvenal, for his part, also assured the participants that the Moscow had no objections to a Japanese occupying the metropolitan see, although, of course, if they wished to receive an bishop from the Russian Orthodox Church, the Patriarch would not ignore this request either. Convinced that the nomination of a new primate was an urgent need, the delegates of the Council chose the Japanese: the decision in favor of Bishop Theodosius (Nagashima) of Kyoto and Western Japan was made unanimously. On March 21, 1972, the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church granted Metropolitan Vladimir's request for resignation and approved the candidacy of a new primate. On March 27, 1972, Archbishop Juvenal and a delegation of the autonomous Church headed by Bishop Theodosius flew to the USSR. On March 28 of the same year, Patriarch Pimen of Moscow headed the enthronement of the new primate.At first,Metropolitan Theodosius had to make considerable efforts to overcome the skeptical attitude of part of the Orthodox flock towards him and the inertia of the elders of the diocesan administration; at the same time, three months later, Nikorai-dō parishioners noted that the new bishop \"in relation to believers ... holds himself much higher and more unapproachable compared to Metropolitan Vladimir\". Metropolitan Theodosius was supported mainly by people of his generation, graduates of St. Vladimir's Seminary: he promoted 39-year-old priest Sabbas Onami, who served in Yamate Parish and served as metropolitan translator and secretary, to the position of head of the Tokyo Consistory; In the Diocese of Kyoto, an important role was played by 41-year—old Archpriest Cyril Arihara, rector of the Osaka Church, and the rector of the Kobe parish, 36-year-old priest Proclus Ushimaru, a classmate of Metropolitan Theodosius at the Tokyo Seminary, a church historian and the only employee of the Department of External Relations of the Japanese Orthodox Church. In Sendai, the burden of diocesan affairs rested on 39-year-old priest Justin Yamaguchi. Already at the Council in July 1972, a number of relocations were made in the Church on the initiative of the new primate: according to the servants of the Patriarchal Compound in Tokyo, \"all those who were in good relations with the former Metropolitan Vladimir turned out to be far on the periphery\".Under Metropolitan Theodosius, the problem of the development of monastic life remained unresolved: apart from the St. Sophia Monastery in Chiba, which was a private initiative of Bishop Nicholas (Sayama), not a single monastery was founded in Japan. The absence of the institution of monasticism, in turn, made it difficult for the succession of episcopal authority in the three departments of the autonomous Church.He died on May 7, 1999. On May 13 of the same year, at 13:00, his funeral service was held at the Holy Resurrection Cathedral in Tokyo, which was performed by: Archbishop Clement (Kapalin) of Kaluga and Borovsk, Archbishop Herman (Swaiko) of Philadelphia and Pennsylvania (Orthodox Church in America), rector of St. Sophia Monastery in Chiba Archbishop Nicholas (Sayama) of Ramenskoye, Bishop Sotirios (Trambas) of Seoul and Korea (Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople), Archpriest John Udics (Orthodox Church in America), Archpriest Nikolai Katsyuban and twenty-four priests of the Japanese Orthodox Church. The funeral service was performed according to the priestly rite in the Church Slavonic and Classical Japanese languages. Under the funeral bells and the singing of the Irmos of the Great Canon \"Helper and Patron\", the coffin with the body of the deceased archpastor was surrounded by the clergy around the cathedral. The archpastors and priests performed the last requiem mass in front of the cathedral. Metropolitan Theodosius was buried at the Yanaka Cemetery, where the tomb of Equal-to-the-Apostles Nicholas of Japan is located, and where Metropolitan Sergius (Tikhomirov) and Bishop Nicholas (Ono) was also buried.\n\n\n== Reflist ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\n\"Архиепископ Токийский, Митрополит всей Японии Феодосий\" (PDF).

        "content": "Amiran Dyakonov is an Ossetian politician from the partially recognized Caucasian Republic of South Ossetia, which most of the UN recognizes as part of Georgia, occupied by Russia. Dyakonov is a veteran legislator for the People's Party, previously being a member of the Unity Party.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 2010 Dyakonov was sued by Prime Minister Vadim Brovtsev for libel, as Dyakonov quoted Brovtsev criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin to Russian news agencies, namely, Brovtsev was quoted criticizing the mechanism Putin created to transfer funds to South Ossetia. In 2015 Dyakonov voiced support for a vote of no confidence that removed David Sanakoev from his post as Minister of Foreign Affairs due to leaking a drafted treaty with Russia to Georgian media which included the annexation of South Ossetia by Russia.\nIn 2014 Dyakonov, then the chairman of the parliamentary committee on legislation, law and local self-government, proposed replacing the term \"foreign agent\" to describe NGOs funded by foreign nations as \"foreign partners.\" The law would be adopted by parliament, however, NGO representatives who were present argued that the change was simply pedantic, and didn't change the underlying legal status of the NGOs. Also in 2014, Dyakonov broke from the Unity Party's ranks by criticizing their leader, Eduard Kokoity stating that he was more preoccupied bribing Russian officials with money set aside for infrastructure reconstruction than actually serving the South Ossetian people.\nIn 2018 Dyakonov criticized the creation of the Otkhozoria–Tatunashvili List, and criticism levied against South Ossetia for the Murder of Archil Tatunashvili, calling it an anti-Ossetian Bacchanalia in an interview with Russian state media, stating that a criminal case was being prepared in South Ossetia for its organizers, for \"perpetuating a genocide\" of South Ossetians. Dyakonov also claimed, as part of the case, that the Ministry of Defense of Georgia killed 30 Ossetians from 2004 to 2008.\nAfter the 2019 parliamentary election Dyakonov was named the chairman of the government's mandate commission, and he nominated United Ossetia's Alan Tadtayev to be named speaker with 25 members of parliament voting in favor, 8 abstaining, and 1 voting against. Afterwards Dyakonov would serve as the head of the parliamentary committee on national policies, culture, religion and media, as which, he denounced Georgian efforts to establish a checkpoint near the village of Tsnelis.\nAlso serving in his function of head of the parliamentary committee on national policies, culture, religion and media, Dyakonov organized the 100th anniversary of the \"Ossetian people’s genocide\" claiming that the Mensheviks' 1918 to 1920 effort to dislodge Ossetian insurgents, was a genocide.\nDyakonov was a vocal critic of Anatoly Bibilov, claiming that Bibilov's positions, namely those revolving around the budget, “do not quite correspond to reality” expressing anger that Bibilov was focusing on minor domestic issues, when the issue of Tsnelis' checkpoint dominated nearly all debates in parliament.\nDuring the 2022 presidential election Dyakonov was one of four members of parliament to support the return of former president Eduard Kokoity to power. However, Kokoity was not able to legally run as he does not meet the residency requirement, which states that a candidate for president must live in South Ossetia, while Kokoity had been living in exile in Moscow since his resignation.\nDespite the People's Party being in the ruling coalition with president Alan Gagloev's party, Nykhaz, Dyakonov has been a vocal critic of Gagloev, accusing the president of merging the powers and responsibilities of the three branches of government to rule without checks and balances. He has also stated that all the systemic problems that existed before the 2022 election remain, and that \"We must make up our minds: either we are building a state, or we are part of Russia. And if we are building a democratic state based on the rule of law, the system of checks and balances between the branches of government must work.\" Dyakonov also expressed dissatisfaction with transitioning from coal to gas power plants, the crisis in the health care system and the \"artificial\" fragmentation of the political field.\nIn 2022 Dyakonov, alongside Alan Gagloev and one of his staffers, Anna Kumaritova, as well as two other members of parliament Zaza Driaev and Vitaly Ikaev, nominated Konstantin Dzhussoev as prime minister, and supported the removal of Timur Kokoity from the Central Election Commission, and the replacement of Magomed Bagaev as Prosecutor General of South Ossetia.\nIn 2024 Dyakonov supported the 22 year in absentia prison sentences to three former South Ossetian politicians who are fugitives in Russia. The trio consisted of; Yan Karkusov, an advisor to Dmitry Sanakoyev, Yan's brother, Jemal Karkusov, member of parliament, shadow minister of internal affairs, and former head of the South Ossetian security council, and their accomplice, Georgy Gogichaev. The Supreme Court of South Ossetia found the trio guilty of “preparing terrorist acts in South Ossetia at the behest of Georgian intelligence services” in 2005, when they defected to Georgia and organized a \"rival government\" to South Ossetia and where joined by their third brother, Uruzmag Karkusov. South Ossetia considered the rival government a \"terrorist organization\" and claimed that the Karkusov brothers where conspiring with Gogichaev, and a fourth brother, Alan Karkusov, who still resided in Tskhinvali, to stage a coup.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Christian People's Party (German: Christliche Volkspartei, abbreviation CVP) was the name of a political party in the Federal Republic of Germany in the 1965. This was not a full-fledged party, but a unique electoral alliance between the Centre Party and the Saarland People's Party (SVP).\nThe CVP was formed on July 17, 1965, through the alliance of the Centre Party and members of the Saarland Christian People's Party that were opposed to the merger of their party into the Saar CDU in 1959 and formed the SVP instead. The centre (which previously briefly used the name \"Christian People's Party\" in the 1920s) and the Saarland CVP were united before, also as a \"Christian People's Party\", from July 1956 to April 1957. The roots of the party limited its appeal primarily to Catholics disenchanted with the (lack of) Christian agenda in CDU.\nCVP vision was to become a framework for Christian parties positioned to the left of the CDU that will not restrict the independence of the parties aligned under this umbrella. The (ultimately unsuccessful) plan was to include into CVP also the German Party, the South Schleswig Voters' Association, the Bavaria Party, and the Baden People's Party, some of which had already been involved with Centre through the Federalist Union.\nThe CVP took part in the 1965 West German federal election, but only in Saarland and North Rhine-Westphalia, due to the relatively small membership and financial support. In Saarland the party got at least 1.4% of the votes, with just 0.1% in North Rhine-Westphalia. Due to this disappointment, the Centre dropped the CVP yet again, but the regional party continued to work under the name Saarland People's Party/Christian People's Party (SVP/CVP).\nIn June 1965 in Saarland state elections SVP/CVP got two mandates with 5.2% of the vote (30,570 votes), which was more than two times less than the SVP share in 1960 elections. Elections of 1970 saw the vote dropping to 0.8% (5,773 votes). With all seats in the Saar state parliament lost, party activity was stopped in 1970.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nWinkler, Jürgen R. (2008). \"Das Parteiensystem des Saarlandes\".

The makam is the central scale used within analysis in the Arel Ezgi Uzdilek system, this is not because this is a scale that's used a lot or otherwise central, but because it can be written without any accidentals.\n\n\n== Çârgâh in 53-TET ==\n\n\n== Comparison with Western scales ==\nSince the makam is based on 53-TET, it is impossible to directly tie it to 12-TET Western scales. However, using the 48-TET model, while worse than many other models in approximation, allows for such comparisons.\nThe approximation of Çârgâh within 48-TET would be the Major Scale.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Luis Belaunde Prendes (4 August 1890 – 21 April 1962) was a Spanish footballer who played as a forward for Atlético Madrid, Athletic Bilbao, and Madrid FC. in a period of just five years between 1910 and 1915.\nHe won the 1911 Copa del Rey with Bilbao, starting and scoring in the final, and was a runner-up with Real Madrid in 1916, losing the final to his former club. In the 1916 cup semifinals, he scored a hat-trick against FC Barcelona to help his side reach the final.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBelaunde was born on 4 August 1890 in Gijón as the son of Luis Belaunde Costa, an industrialist and banker, being the president of the Banco de Crédito Industrial Gijónés, and María Mercedes Prendes, the niece-in-law of the writer Armando Palacio Valdés and daughter of the former mayor of Gijón, Manuel Prendes Hevia. He began playing football for his hometown club Sporting de Gijón. His father, together with Felipe Valdés, the father of another Sporting player, founded the Gijón newspaper El Noroeste. It was a newspaper with a markedly republican character and a certain leftist tendency.\nBeing the son of a well-off family, Belaunde studied at the Colegio de la Inmaculada in Gijón, and played football on its team, Sporting's main rival in the early years. He was then sent to Switzerland to complete his studies.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\n\n\n=== Sporting de Gijón ===\nBelaunde returned to Asturias in 1908, at the age of 18, and began playing football at Somió FC as well as training with the reserve team of Sporting de Gijón. He eventually earned a spot in the starting eleven, featuring alongside the Buylla brothers (Plácido and Vicente). On 26 October 1910, he was part of the Gijón team that faced Madrid FC, helping his side to a 3–0 victory over the meringues. This impressive performance does not go unnoticed and four players of the Gijón team were signed by Atlético Madrid, including Belaunde.\n\n\n=== Atlético Madrid and Athletic Bilbao ===\nBelaunde adapted quickly to the new club, partly thanks to the help of two former Gijón players, Saturnino and Fernando Villaverde. His own younger brother, Manuel, who also played for Sporting de Gijón, would follow Luis' footsteps and join Atlético as well shortly after.\nHis outstanding performances at the club led him to be loaned to Atlético's subsidiary, Athletic Bilbao, to play in the semifinal and final of the 1911 Copa del Rey, since the Basque team was forced to replace Sloop and Martin, who had not been residing in Spain for the necessary time of six months, following the protests of other teams.\nBelaunde ended up playing a crucial role in helping the team win the 1911 Copa del Rey, starting in both the semifinal against Sociedad Gimnástica (2–0) and against RCD Espanyol in the final, where he scored his side's second goal in an eventual 3–1 victory.\nBelaunde had to wait three years until making his competitive debut with Atlético on 9 November 1913, the year in which the club finally began to contest the regional championship of Madrid. In total, he played nine regional matches between 1913 and 1915, scoring three goals, two against Madrid FC in January and November of 1914, and the other was a winner against Sociedad Gimnástica on 8 November 1914. In his fifth and last season with Atlético in 1916, he alternated his presence in the line-ups of Atlético and Madrid FC, playing six official matches with the former and two with the latter,  thus becoming the first (and only) player in history to play for both of these clubs at the same time. During this period, he trained simultaneously with both clubs, and in fact, he sometimes trained with Madrid in the morning and with Atlético in the afternoon.\n\n\n=== Madrid FC ===\nJust like with Athletic Bilbao, the two matches that Belaunde played for Madrid were both in the Copa del Rey. In the semifinals of the 1916 edition, Madrid faced FC Barcelona in the first competitive El Clásico in 14 years, and since both teams won their home leg, a replay had to be played, so both teams were reinforced; Madrid with Belaunde from Atlético and Casanova from the Toledo Infantry Academy. Belaunde proved to be the best option as he scored a hat-trick, including a last-minute equalizer to make it 4–4 and force extra time, which ended in a 6–6 draw. Even though Belaunde was then replaced by Zabalo for the second replay, which ended in a 4–2 victory, he started in the final, in which they faced his former club, Athletic Bilbao, losing 0–4.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nOn 18 August 1951, the Minister of Finance Francisco Gómez de Llano confirmed that Belaunde was going to effectively take over as the new Senior Chief of Administration of the General Body of Administration of the Public Treasury.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nBelaunde married Asunción Fernández Montero, natural of Balmaseda, and the couple established their residence in El Escorial. They had one son, Luis Belaunde Fernández (1937–2003).\nBelaunde died on 21 April 1962, at the age of 71.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nAthletic Club\n\nCopa del Rey:\nWinners: 1911\nMadrid FC\n\nCopa del Rey:\nRunner-up: 1916\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Andrei Valentin Coban (born 8 December 1977 in Chisinau, Moldova) is a researcher and writer who studies the structure of the human personality, of the human being, his soul, mind and body. He is the author of the book \"Open Heart - Meeting\". Since 2023 he has completely changed his occupation, moved to Switzerland and became the owner of the company \"Open Your Heart\".\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThe main concepts of Andrei Coban and Amy Coban have led them to the creation of Open Your Heart Ltd. These concepts outline their theory regarding gender dynamics and the composition of the human being. Here's a breakdown of each concept:\n\nDivision into Male and Female:\nEverything in the world is divided into masculine and feminine aspects. This concept can encompass many aspects of life, including energy dynamics, relationships and social structures.\nEnergy Flow from Male to Female:\nThere is a flow of energy from the masculine to the feminine. This implies a dynamic exchange of energy between masculine and feminine forces, with masculine energy somehow contributing to and supporting feminine energy.\nComposition of the Human Being:\nSoul, mind and body are three fundamental components of the human being. In order to achieve holistic well-being, self-determination, self-understanding and personal growth, they emphasise the importance of understanding and integrating these aspects..\nThey also state that the core essence of the soul is its gender, implying that gender identity plays a significant role in shaping an individual's spiritual, self-realization and personal development. And since gender is the core of the soul, it can't be changed.\nThese concepts likely inform the services and approaches offered by \"Open Your Heart\" GmbH, guiding their work in supporting individuals on their journey towards personal development, self-realization, wealth, self-healing, spiritual growth, and holistic well-being.\nThe company focuses on developing personality and improving relationships as a means to address various personal issues and challenges. Here's a summary of the key aspects:\n\nDeveloping Personality in Relationships:\nThe company places a strong emphasis on enhancing individual personality traits within the context of relationships. This could involve improving communication skills, fostering emotional intelligence, and cultivating empathy and understanding.\nSolving Multiple Personal Issues:\nBy focusing on personality development within relationships, the company aims to address a wide range of personal issues. This could include navigating life transitions, resolving conflicts, managing stress, and fostering personal growth and fulfillment.\nAddressing Live Situations:\nThe strategies and techniques offered by the company are designed to help individuals navigate real-life situations with greater ease and resilience. This could involve handling challenging circumstances, making important decisions, and finding balance and stability in everyday life.\nFinancial Issues:\nThe company may offer support and guidance for individuals facing financial challenges within the context of their relationships. This could include budgeting, financial planning, and strategies for improving financial well-being while maintaining healthy relationships.\nAdjusting Psychological Equilibrium:\nThrough personality development and relationship-building strategies, the company aims to help individuals achieve a greater sense of psychological equilibrium. This involves finding balance, stability, and emotional well-being amidst life's ups and downs.\nInner Self-Awareness and Calmness:\nThe company's tailored approaches help the person to navigate and resolve conflicts within relationships, promoting harmony and understanding by addressing underlying issues that are hidden from the person's mind.  It allows for alternative perspectives and interpretations of challenging situations. By shifting mindsets and taking a broader view, it helps to develop greater flexibility and adaptability in dealing with the ups and downs of life.\nApplicability Across Multiple Aspects of Life:\nThe strategies and principles taught by the company are intended to be applicable across various aspects of life, including personal relationships, work environments, and other areas. This holistic approach ensures that individuals can apply their learning to different contexts and situations.\nOverall, \"Open Your Heart\" GmbH aims to empower individuals to develop strong personalities and cultivate healthy, fulfilling relationships as a means to address personal issues and thrive in all aspects of life.\n\n\n== Career ==\nDecides to change his profession and start his own company \"Open Your Heart GmbH\" in 2023.\nHe eventually left the chemical industry to join the IT and telecoms industry after 2005. He has worked successfully for ISP and telecoms support companies such as Tektronix Communications, Netscout Systems and Microsoft Corporation.\nRelocated to Moscow where he worked as a research scientist at ChemBridge Corporation between 2003 and 2005.\nWorked as a researcher at the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Moldova between 2000 and 2003.\nHe graduated from the Faculty of Chemistry at the University of Moldova (USM) in 2000, specializing in organic chemistry.

        "content": "On 13 March 2024, a picture of socks being sold at a KK Super Mart in Sunway City, Petaling Jaya went viral on Malaysian social media due to the socks being printed with the word Allah, the Arabic word for God.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nThis case received the attention of the public and politicians such as Dr. Muhamad Akmal Saleh, Datuk Seri Ab Rauf Yusoh, Datuk Razali Idris, and Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS) leaders. Some political analysts suggested that some Muslim politicians were using the event to rally the support of Malay nationalists and \"divide multicultural Malaysia\".Some commentators urged the public not to exaggerate this issue, including Chong Sin Woon, Wee Ka Siong, Loke Siew Fook, Nga Kor Ming, Dato Sri Tiong King Sing, Datuk Seri Dr. Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.\nOn social media, some users called for a boycott of the store chain.KK Super Mart apologized for the sale of the socks, and said the item would be pulled from shelves. Xin Jian Chang, the company which distributed the socks, also apologized, saying the socks in questions were one of five such pairs in a shipment of 18,800 pairs of socks produced by a Chinese company. KK Super Mart reported that they found the socks in stock at three of their 800 outlets.Since the boycott, there have been three Molotov cocktail-throwing incidents at KK Super Mart branches. On 28 March at 5:35 am (just six days after similar attacks was happened in Crocus City Hall at Krasnogorsk, Moscow Oblast, Russia), a Molotov cocktail was thrown at a KK Super Mart branch at Bidor, Perak from a car. Two days later, another KK Super Mart branch at Kuantan was hit by a Molotov cocktail, causing a small fire at the entrance. Another branch in Kuching was also hit by a Molotov cocktail on 1 April. The attacks are still under investigation, but according to the police chief of Kuantan, Wan Mohamad Zahari Wan Busu, the attack may be related to the sock controversy.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nYang di-Pertuan Agong, Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar and Acting Sultan of Johor (Tunku Mahkota Johor), Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim ordered that the those responsible are subject to strict action by the authorities to avoid the same incident from happening again.Director of the Bukit Aman Criminal Investigation Department, Mohd Shuhaily Mohd Zain, said two investigation papers were opened after his party received 42 reports. This case will be investigated by the Bukit Aman Classified Crime Investigation Unit according to Section 298A of the Penal Code which is for religious reasons, causing an atmosphere of disharmony, division or enmity, hatred, malice or harming unity.\nOn March 20, the man who posted the original photo of the socks to social media was arrested.On March 25, Malaysian police announced that the directors of KK Super Mart and the Xin Jian Chang distribution company would be held liable in court. The directors of KK Super Mart would be charged under Section 298 of the Penal Code for \"intentionally wounding religious feelings\", while the Xin Jian Chang distribution company would be charged with \"abetting the offense\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nCrocus City Hall attack, related to Molotov attacks as a reaction of the controversy\nReligion in Malaysia\nFreedom of religion in Malaysia\nTitular Roman Catholic Archbishop of Kuala Lumpur v.

        "content": "Lucius Kutchin, also known as Lou Kutchin and Lucius Brown Kutchin, was an American modernist painter known for his portraits, landscapes, and still lifes.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nKutchin was born Lucius Brown, most likely in Macarthur, Ohio, and grew up in New Straitsville. His parents were Americus Lee Brown and Hattie Bratton Brown. His mother died when he was 13, and Lucius went to live with relatives, eventually being adopted informally by Emma Louise Kutchin, who lived in Columbus, Ohio and was a longtime supporter of the arts in that city.\nHe got some initial art training even before he became a student at the Columbus Art School, where he studied with Alice Schille and Charles Rosen between 1921 and 1924. He also studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia between 1922 and 1928, where he won the Packard Prize for one of his drawings (1925), and two back-to-back Cresson Traveling Scholarships (1927–1928) for foreign travel and study.  He spent time in France and Italy. Among his mentors at the Pennsylvania Academy were Arthur Beecher Carles, Henry Breckenridge, Henry McCarter, and Daniel Garber. The greatest influence on Kutchin's mature style came from the painter John Carroll, whom Kutchin met in the early 1920s.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nKutchin mostly painted portraits, figure studies, landscapes, and still lifes in oil. He worked in an expressive modernist idiom dominated by a sense of melancholy, using a dark and muted palette. The sitters for his portraits and figure studies are painted in a stylized way that conveys the sense less of an individual person than of a general type. Typically outlined against their backgrounds and looking down and away from the viewer, they often seem emotionally isolated and unapproachable. He is known to have made some of his own picture frames, painting them to visually integrate them with the artwork.\nHe also made a number of monotypes, often adding to them with pencil, pastel, or crayon after the print was pulled. His monotypes are lighter in feeling than his oils, with strong and graceful line work. The subjects for these included women's heads and horses in motion. He was commissioned to paint several murals as part of the Public Works of Art Project, such as Youth (now lost), at the South High School in Columbus.\nFrom 1928 to 1931, Kutchin lived in the Southwest, settling near Santa Fe, New Mexico, where his mature painting style developed and he became known as one of the New Mexico Modernists. His work keyed into what he perceived as the spiritual aspects of the landscape there. Even after he left New Mexico, it remained an inspiration for some of his paintings, although he only visited it once again, in the summer of 1935.\nIn 1931 he moved back to Columbus, Ohio, where he was active in the Columbus Art League, serving on exhibition committees and exhibiting work in the League's annual shows. In 1934, he became the Sunday art editor of the Columbus Dispatch, writing a bylined column of art criticism. He exhibited regularly at a range of different local venues from 1932 on, gaining reputation in part as a member of \"The New Group,\" which comprised seven of the city's most avant-garde artists. He also exhibited nationally, taking part in group shows in New York, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and other cities. In 1933 he gained a New York art dealer, Milch Gallery.\nKutchin spent the summer of 1936 in Gloucester, Massachusetts. In the fall of that year, he contracted a fatal case of bronchial pneumonia and died on November 10.\nTowards the end of his life, Kutchin was beginning to gain a national reputation, with one-person shows in Detroit and Boston. When he died, he was preparing for an upcoming solo show at Milch Gallery. After he died, however, interest in his small oeuvre lapsed for several decades. In 1988, Kutchin was the subject of a retrospective solo exhibition at the Columbus Museum of Art, which holds a dozen of his paintings and monotypes. He has also been included in a number of survey shows.\n\n\n== Selected exhibitions ==\n\"Exhibition of Five Columbus Painters.\" Columbus Gallery of Fine Arts, 1936.

As Twitch reduced the video quality to 720p and halted VOD playback, causing concerns among streamers in South Korea who were considering migrating to other platforms after Twitch terminated its services, many Twitch streamers reportedly had meetings with Naver.\nAccording to internet broadcasters who attended the meetings, ChijiJik's UI and system are said to be quite similar to Twitch's. Features supported by Twitch such as VOD playback and clips are included, with plans for up to 4K streaming in addition to 1080p. There is a rechargeable sponsorship system integrated with Naver Pay, with the unit being 'cheese'.\nAccording to information technology industry sources on December 8, 2023, Twitch held a business meeting with Naver the previous day to discuss transferring its streamers to Naver's upcoming gaming streaming platform, \"CHZZK\" scheduled for release on the 19th.\n\n\n== Beta testing ==\nTimeline\nFrom December 5 to 8, internal testing was conducted through broadcasts of in-house League of Legends tournaments. Commentary was provided by Jung No-chul, Necklitt, and Kang Kwi.\nOn December 6, an official announcement for recruiting beta testers was posted.\nThe mobile app was renamed to 'CHZZK (치지직)' as the existing Naver gaming app incorporated streaming functionality.\n\n\n== Features ==\nDuring beta testing, streaming uses H.264 codec with an 8000kbit/s bitrate.\nAccounts banned by streamers cannot chat in the respective streamer's channel. Temporary bans last for 30 seconds and can be applied repeatedly. If permanently banned, *followers of the respective streamer are immediately unfollowed, and the follow button is disabled, preventing further following.\nbasic layout of the UI is similar to Twitch, making it easy for existing Twitch users to adapt.\nmobile application offers a feature to zoom in on specific parts of the screen.\nsponsorship currency, cheese (twitch bits), can be paid with Naver Pay or accumulated Naver Pay points.\nextreme lag\n\n\n== See also ==\nNaver\nTwitch\nList of social networking services\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Robert Jacob (died 1588) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJacob was the eldest son of Giles Jacob of London, was entered at Merchant Taylors' School on 21 Jan. 1563–4 (Register, ed. Robinson, i. 4). He matriculated as a sizar of Trinity College, Cambridge, on 12 November 1565, proceeded B.A. in 1569–70, was elected a fellow, and in 1573 commenced M.A. He graduated M.D. at Basle, and was incorporated at Cambridge on 15 May 1579. He became physician to Queen Elizabeth, who in 1581 sent him, at the Czar Ivan's request, to the Russian court, where he attended the czarina, and acquired a reputation which still survives. Jacob recommended Lady Mary Hastings to the czar for his seventh wife. Happily for the lady the czar died before the conclusion of the negotiations, which were opened in 1583 with the sanction of Elizabeth. Jacob returned to England with Sir Jerome Bowes, the English envoy in Russia, about March 1584. The Russian company charged him with trading on his own account. On 21 May 1583 he was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians in London, a candidate on 12 November 1585, and a fellow on 15 March 1586. In the latter year he went out to Russia a second time. He died abroad, unmarried, in 1588 (Probate Act Book, P. C. C., June 1588).\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Goodwin, Gordon (1892). \"Jacob, Robert\". In Lee, Sidney (ed.).

        "content": "A Village Bullfight or A Village Corrida (Spanish: Corrida de toros en un pueblo) is an oil painting by the Spanish painter Francisco Goya.\nThe artwork depicts a bullfight scene taking place in a small village. It belongs to a series of four cabinet paintings of similar dimensions, executed in oil paint on tropical wood panels. The series portrays various themes, but their common underlying idea is madness. These paintings were most likely not commissioned but originated from the painter's creativity. The exact date of creation is unknown but is dated to the period after the French occupation. They are part of the collection of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid.\n\n\n== Circumstances of creation ==\nThe painting belongs to a series of four cabinet works of small dimensions painted on wood panels. The series also includes: A Procession of Flagellants, The Inquisition Tribunal and The Madhouse. Thematically and technically similar is also the painting The Burial of the Sardine, included in this series by some researchers. The works were created as a thematically related cycle of \"whims and inventions\", the central theme of which is madness. Irrationalism in all its manifestations was a constant theme in Goya's art. It often appears in his drawings, where the artist ironically depicts characters who consider themselves wiser or more civilized than others. Earlier examples of his paintings include Yard with Lunatics (1793–1794) and Plague hospital (1806–1808). Thematically, the paintings are close to Spanish Black Legend. They depict some aspects of life in early 19th-century Spain that Enlightenment supporters and liberals attempted to reform. The fierce criticism of society seems to be an expression of anger and sadness felt after the war and the restoration of absolute monarchy by Ferdinand VII. The pessimistic vision is also marked by the painter's personal crisis associated with the illness and death of his wife, Josefa Bayeu, in 1812. Among these scenes, the bullfight is the least terrifying and the simplest to interpret in terms of both form and content. Goya refers to themes from an earlier series of cabinet paintings painted in 1793, which included eight bullfight scenes.\nGoya was a great lover of bullfighting, as evidenced by numerous compositions depicting bullfights executed in various techniques and appearing regularly throughout his career. He also painted portraits of famous bullfighters like Portrait of the Matador Pedro and Portrait of toreador José Romero, and included himself in the design of the tapestry La Novillada, depicting a bullfight with young bulls. Despite this, Goya did not depict bullfighting as a positive pastime; works on this subject contain a clear critique of irrational brutality and cruelty. In Spain, bullfights attracted spectators from all social classes and were known for numerous excesses. Since the time of Philip V, several royal decrees have been issued that, in line with the Enlightenment, prohibited the killing of bulls and even the spectacle itself. Charles IV also reiterated the ban in 1805. Official bans were accepted among the aristocracy but ignored by the people, who continued to massively participate in bullfights held throughout Spain and its colonies.\n\n\n== Dating ==\n\nThere is no precise information about the period in which this series of paintings was created; the first documented mention of them comes from the will of the collector Manuel García de la Prada, drawn up in 1836. The timeframe established based on the style and themes of the works covers the period of the Peninsular War fought from 1808 to 1814 and the subsequent period of intensified repression by King Ferdinand VII lasting until 1820–1821. This was a period of accusations of collaboration, interrogations, and purges at the royal court. The somber atmosphere of these works also suggests that they were painted after King Ferdinand VII regained the throne in 1813. From November 1814 to April 1815, Goya lived in uncertainty as to whether the testimonies of his friends would suffice to clear his name. Ultimately, he faced no consequences for his work as court painter under the rule of Joseph Bonaparte and was cleared of suspicion.\nBased on the costumes of the characters, the likely period of creation can be narrowed down to 1814–1816. There are also similarities between these works and drawings from Album C and the later prints from the series The Disasters of War, dated to 1815–1816. A Village Bullfight probably originated around the same time as the series of prints titled La Tauromaquia, made between 1815 and 1816. The painting is closely related to the earliest prints and their preparatory drawings. There is a clear resemblance between the depicted scene and print number 27 titled The celebrity Fernando del Toro, \"varilarguero\", forcing the beast with his \"garrocha\".\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe scene depicts a popular bullfight organized in a small town. A makeshift fence made of wooden beams surrounds the arena, where numerous spectators have gathered. There is a palpable atmosphere of excitement and anticipation. The painting captures one of the most dramatic moments of the bullfight, as the mounted picadors begin to tease the still strong bull. The picador in the center of the arena prepares to thrust his lance into the clearly tense and alert animal. The sharp end of the lance and the bull's horns are at the center of the scene. Other bullfighters are positioned around, with a second picador barely discernible in the background. A row of houses is visible behind the arena.\nThe painting features a thoughtful and innovative composition: the subject is approached with the descriptive naturalism of a photographic image. The fight scene in the center of the painting is very clear due to the differentiation of characters by color – the bull, the mounted picador, and the assistants form distinct color spots. Similarly to La Tauromaquia, the surrounding audience is only sketched. The wooden fence separating the spectators from the arena is clearly visible, while the audience and houses further back in the composition are blurred. The viewpoint, located at the height of the grandstand, offers a view of the first row of spectators facing away, the arena, and the distant buildings. It is not precisely known what time of day the bullfight takes place. The way in which the shadow surrounds the arena from both the left and right sides while the center remains brightest is interesting. In this way, the artist focuses the viewer's attention on the confrontation between the bull and the picador, while the audience turns into an anonymous, monochromatic mass.\n\nThe spectators in the foreground sit on steps arranged in a semicircle reminiscent of Bullfight in a divided ring, also depicting a bullfight. In both cases, the light comes from the opposite side, resulting in dark silhouettes. A similar arrangement of figures is also visible in The meadow of San Isidro, with buildings in the background. All the figures are individualized, even those seen from behind, such as the broad silhouette of the man in a hat positioned directly under the horse's head, creating the axis of perspective and the central point around which the entire composition revolves. The entire town has come to see the spectacle, and one can identify a mother breastfeeding her child, a couple in love, a Benedictine, men and women in majos and majas costumes, and children. Only on the right side is the row of figures facing away broken by a woman who, with wide-open eyes, gazes at the viewer. Her face reflects the consternation and nightmare of the spectacle in which she is participating. She is the only person aware of the brutality of bullfighting and the pervasive madness engulfing the audience. Goya introduced a similar character in A Procession of Flagellants. The painting, seemingly a genre scene of a local festival, is in reality a new interpretation of madness, which appears to be the theme of this series.\nElías Tormo reviewed a copy from the Baroness de Areyzaga's collection, exhibited in Zaragoza in 1908. Enrique Lafuente Ferrari states that the painter Francisco Lameyer made faithful copies of all four paintings in this series.\n\n\n== Technique ==\nThe paintings were executed on wooden panels made of hard tropical mahogany, possibly sourced from colonies such as Cuba. A similar support was used for the sketch of Saints Justa and Rufina from 1817 and The Burial of the Sardine. It is not a refined material; it is possible that Goya used boards from cigar boxes imported from the colonies. Radiography of the paintings reveals that the base was made from two larger and two smaller pieces of wood perfectly joined to achieve the desired dimensions. The use of such a support may also indicate the post-war period when there was a shortage of materials for painting, and Goya had a habit of reusing canvases and painting over finished works. All the paintings were covered with the same beige-orange underpainting, which smoothed the porous surface of the wood. The underpainting covering the entire surface of the panel of A Village Bullfight remains visible in many places within the composition and at the edges of the board.\nThe freedom of technique is a distinguishing feature of this painting. Goya applied diluted paint with a brush in a technique similar to gouache, achieving thin and transparent layers of color. In other areas, he used quick, expressive brushstrokes with a large amount of paint. The composition is almost monochromatic; both the audience and bullfighters are outlined in black paint and animated with eye-catching color accents or small white brushstrokes. Goya used diluted carmine and blue for two spectators on the right. The background figures are painted in an almost abstract manner, yet the sparse brushstrokes are precise, giving even the distant figures individual character, such as the man leaning out from behind the railing on the right, provoking the bull by waving a hat or scarf. The row of houses in the background was created with light brushstrokes in shades of gray, creating a blurred effect in the air.\n\n\n== Provenance ==\nThe owner of the series was the wealthy banker and collector Manuel García de la Prada, a friend of Goya, who was portrayed by the painter around 1805–1808. However, it is not known when or under what circumstances he acquired the paintings. García de la Prada emigrated from Spain in 1812 and returned in 1821. If the paintings were created earlier, during the war period, he could have bought them directly from the painter in Madrid. Otherwise, he may have acquired them after his return to the country during the Trienio Liberal (1820–1823) or shortly before Goya's emigration to France in 1824. He could also have purchased them only after Goya's death from his son, Javier. An inventory of Goya's works made after his death in 1828 lists \"four small paintings depicting saints and customs\", which probably refers to this cycle. Assuming this identification is correct, the series was not sold during the painter's lifetime; it is not known whether he decided to keep it for himself or did not find a buyer. The paintings were certainly part of García de la Prada's collection in 1836 when he mentioned them in his will, bequeathing them to the Academy of San Fernando, along with The Burial of the Sardine. In his will, García de la Prada mentioned that these paintings were \"highly valued by the professors [of the academy]\". Since Goya was a member of it and often exhibited his paintings there, perhaps these were also known to the Madrid institution. However, according to Manuela Mena, the subjects of these paintings and the criticism contained in them were too closely associated with the conservative government for Goya to present them at the academy or sell them before the Trienio Liberal. All the paintings were included in the academy's collection in December 1839, after the owner's death.\nThe painting was chosen for the illustrated collection of the most important works of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando published in 1885. For this purpose, the painter José María Galván made a drawing and engraving based on the painting.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nYriarte, Charles (1867). Goya.

        "content": "Ronnie Harris was a British singer, active in the 1950s, who had a top ten hit in 1955.\n\n\n== Singing career ==\nHarris served in the Second World War as an air mechanic in the Royal Naval Air Service, based in Portsmouth. after demob he joined his brother's window-cleaning company in north London, but, after a fall from a ladder, the customer invited him inside to recover; the pair got to discussing his love of singing, and he was invited to perform at a concert that evening, the success of which gained him bookings as a singer.  He therefore turned professional as a dance band singer and in the late 1940s he teamed up with Margaret Haynes, who performed under the name Terry Blayne, as a duo; the pair got married in Nottingham in January 1950.In April 1954, he signed a record deal with Columbia Records, and he had over a dozen singles released over the decade, including duets with Barbara Ryan.  Despite being the subject of a Pathé News short about the making of a pop single in early 1955, only two of them made any of the national music charts.  The first, a cover of the Al Martino hit \"The Story Of Tina\", peaked at no. 12 in the New Musical Express chart in October 1954.  The low chart position belied the song's popularity, as he was presented with a Record of the Year award for the cut in the Royal Albert Hall Record Ball the same month.The second, \"Don't Go To Strangers\", backed by The Coronets, was at number 9 in the first Record Mirror chart on 22 January 1955, and peaked at 8 a week later.  However it did not appear in the NME chart.\nHarris however missed out on a possible hit single in 1957, after he turned down the chance to record \"Around The World\", thinking that it was not \"a particularly good number\".  Instead it became a top ten hit for Bing Crosby, Ronnie Hilton, and Gracie Fields.\nAs skiffle and rock and roll began to dominate the charts, Harris gradually stepped back from performing, and in April 1958 emigrated to Germany; he soon opened his own talent agency, originally based in Wiesbaden.  By 1975 he was based in Kent and specialized in finding European bookings for British acts.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRonnie Harris articles and discography",

His grandfather was the Grand Vizier Bahaa al-Din bin Hanna, who was the vizier of Baybars and one of his closest men as well as his father Fakhr al-Din Mahammad bin Hanna.\nHis father, the vizier Fakhr al-Din Abu Abdullah Mahammad, had a position during the reign of Baybars, influence on the course of events at that time, and prestige in the souls, as his personality and knowledge had an influence not only on the souls of the common people, but also on the senior statesmen, and this was not limited to Egypt, but extended to the Levant.\nFakhr al-Din Mahammad married the daughter of al-Asaad Sharaf al-Din Abu Sa'id Hibatullah Sa'id al-Faizi, with whom he had al-Sahib Taj al-Din Mahammad and his brother Zayn al-Din Ahmad.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe was virtuous and religious, a lover of the poor and philanthropists, a leader who was generous with whatever benevolence he asked for, adorned with necklaces and beauties, respected, possessed of great sanctity and great respect, good in news and narrations, learned in the Shafi’i doctrine, and taught at his grandfather’ madrasa. He was appointed Vizier of Companionship to Sultan Baybars. And on his biography, Izz al-Din ibn Shaddad said: \"He acknowledged his good management of the eyes, and he investigated the suspected matters entrusted to him, and made knowledge the knowledge that guided him in solving the problems of matters, and inclination toward servants and asceticism was a shield of piety and caution\"He represented his grandfather in the vizirate.\nAhmad bin Hanna was one of the closest men to the Sultan of Egypt, Baybars, like his father and grandfather. Ahmad bin Hanna was chosen for the position of Vizier of Companionship, which is the position of a traveling vizier, accompanying the Sultan on his travels and wars to perform the function of a minister and manage its affairs with him.\nBaybars chose him to participate with him in the Battle of Elbistan against the Ilkhanid Mongols, the Sultanate of Rum, the Armenians, and Georgians. He led a military force against the Mongols, and although he was originally a vizier, he fought in the front lines with great courage that historians have recorded, and he killed a large number of Mongols. Baybars was greatly impressed by his courage, so he realized that appointing him as Vizier of Companionship was the right decision.\n\n\n== Death ==\nHe maintained his sanctity and status throughout his life, relying on his asceticism, piety, knowledge, literature, and knowledge of the politics of matters, deriving this from the home in which he grew up and the environment in which he grew up, which qualified him to appear on the political scene again, as it is mentioned that when the vizierate was delegated to his brother, al-Sahib Taj al-Din, in the year 693 AH / 1293 AD, he was his partner, as they sat together in the Council of Viziers to handle matters.\nHis death was on the seventh of Safar in the year 704 AH/1304 AD, and he was buried in Qarafa in Cairo.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBahaa el-Din bin Hanna\n\n\n== References ==",

In 1751 he published ‘Practical Cases and Observations in Surgery,’ his most important work. It contains records of cases observed in England and the West Indies. He describes one successful and one unsuccessful operation in cases of abdominal wounds penetrating the bowel. He washed the intestine with hot claret, and then stitched the peritoneum to the edge of the wound and the abdominal wall. The procedure is one of the earliest English examples of a method of surgery which was later universally adopted. In 1754 he went to live in Fenchurch Street, London, and in 1755 published ‘An Historical Account of the several Plagues that have appeared in the World since the year 1346.’ It is a mere compilation. On 24 January 1759 he was elected from among five candidates to the office of surgeon to Christ's Hospital, and thenceforward resided there. He sometimes visited Epsom, and in 1767 published ‘An Enquiry as to the Origin of Magnesia Alba,’ the principal saline ingredient of the Epsom springs. A controversy had arisen as to the cause of death of a potman who had received a blow on the head in an election riot at Brentford in 1769, and he published a lengthy pamphlet entitled ‘The Blow, or Inquiry into the Cause of Mr. Clarke's Death at Brentford,’ which demonstrates that blood-poisoning arising from an ill-dressed scalp wound was the true cause of death. In 1777 he published ‘A Strict and Impartial Inquiry into the Cause of Death of the late William Scawen,’ an endeavour to prove that poison had not been administered. In 1790 it was stated that he was too old for his work at Christ's Hospital, and as he would not resign he was superseded in 1791. He died at Epsom on 5 April 1793.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1892). \"Ingram, Dale\". In Lee, Sidney (ed.).

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "\"No More Hot Dogs\" is a rockabilly song by Hasil Adkins. The track was originally recorded around 1955 in mono. Adkins plays all of his own instruments and the track includes his acoustic Gibson guitar and a stripped-down drumkit.\n\"No More Hot Dogs\" begins with Adkins maniacally laughing. In the track, he sings about how he is going to decapitate his girlfriend and mount her head on his wall so she won't eat any more hot dogs. He sings that he is going to cut off her head at \"half past eight\" and have it hanging on his wall at \"half past ten\".\nAdkins described the inspiration for the song being a double date he went on to a drive-in as a teenager in the 1950s. According to him, \n\n\"This fellow took his girlfriend out and I took mine out, stopped at a drive-in. We didn't really have no money to buy anything. Hotdog was just 10 cents. So he figured and I did too that the girls would eat dinner before we picked them up. Pulled in and his girlfriend said 'Well, I'll have a couple of hotdogs and a Coke.' And the way he looked at her, he could have cut her head off. 'Cause he didn't have maybe 70 or 80 cents on him. And I didn't have maybe 40, 50 cents. And that's where I got that song from, the way he looked at her.\"\nIn an interview, Adkins later related \"I gotta bunch more scary songs in my mind that I'm gonna record. I really made up 'No More Hot Dogs' for little kids.\" According to him, patrons of beer joints would pay him up to $50 to not play the song.\nReviews of \"No More Hot Dogs\" typically remark on the macabre subject matter and Adkins' unsettling laughter on the track. LA Weekly described the song as \"schizophrenic\" while The Commercial Appeal declared that it was a \"paean to lunacy\".\nAdkins' music was rediscovered by The Cramps drummer Miriam Linna in the early 1980s. His music was identified as a predecessor of psychobilly and featured in an article in her New York-based zine Kicks. Linna's record label Norton Records released a compilation of Adkins' songs with the 1986 album Out to Hunch, which included songs that Adkins recorded between 1955 and 1965. \"No More Hot Dogs\" was the second song on the album. \"No More Hot Dogs\" was one of many songs Adkins wrote dealing with themes of meat and decapitation. The album Out to Hunch also included the hot dog-themed song, \"Hot Dog Baby\". A review in AllMusic concluded that \"after listening to it, hot dogs will never seem quite the same again.\"\nThe song was used in Robert Rodriguez's 1994 film Roadracers. The song can also be heard in the 1994 television series Rebel Highway, the 2009 film White Lightnin', and the 2021 episode of The Simpsons, \"A Serious Flanders\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Thamar Richey (August 8, 1858- October 20, 1937) was an educator, known for her work with the Yaqui community in Arizona.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThamar Richey was born on August 8, 1858, in Saltsburg, Pennsylvania. As a child, she moved to Illinois and Missouri, where she graduated from Maryvale High School at sixteen. In 1874, she obtained a teaching job in Ottawa County. She went on to teach in other schools. In 1879, she moved to Kansas with her family, where she continued to teach.\nIn 1892, Richey took a teaching position with the Federal Indian Service. She was assigned to a school on the Fort Mojave Indian Reservation and then became the head matron at the Haskell Institute, later moving to be the principal at Indian schools in Nebraska and Minnesota. In 1901, Richey returned to Holton, Kansas, to be with her ill parents. She served on the faculty of the Emporia Normal School teachers' college and at a small local college.\nIn 1919, Richey took a job teaching near Greaterville, Arizona to be near her brother. In 1923, she moved to Tucson, but there were no open teaching positions. Richey asked school superintendent C.E. Rose if he would approve a job if she could find a school. Richey created a school for Pascua Yaqui Tribe students, using a small ceremonial site as a makeshift school, where she initially taught kindergarten and 1-C (pre-first grade). The school taught students to speak English, and they then went elsewhere for elementary and grammar school education. Richey successfully advocated for the Tuscan School Board to build a schoolroom, even though the children lived outside the district. Initially, Richey, unable to speak Yaqui, required two interpreters, one to translate her English into Spanish, and the other to translate Spanish into Yaqui.\nRichey acted as a patroness for the Yaqui community. She worked with local nonprofits to distribute clothing, food, and other items at Pascua. From the winter of 1924 to 1925, Richey prepared lunch for her students in a sort of early-day free school lunch program. During the Great Depression, Richey begged for food and clothing for her students, whose families were greatly struggling. Richey worked directly with families, rather than going through community or missionary leadership, which was common.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nRichey retired in 1937. She died on October 14, 1937, in her home in Tucson, Arizona. The Yaqui elders held a candlelight vigil for her, and the village attended her funeral.\nIn 1955, the Tucson Board of Education built the Richey Elementary School, named in honor of Richey.\nIn 1988, Richey was inducted into the Arizona Women's Hall of Fame.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Imaginary Friends is a 1991 fantasy short story by Terry Brooks, and was an early \"prototype/precursor\" of what would later become the \"Word and Void\" series. It was published as part of Unfettered, which is a collection of fantasy short stories that Brooks contributed to, the proceeds of which went to his friend and editor of the book, Shawn Speakman's \"considerable medical bills.\"\n\n\n== Plot summary ==\nJack is a normal 13-year-old boy living with his parents in a house near a park forest. The story begins with Jack being diagnosed with a blood disorder, like leukemia. A flashback reveals that when he was 6 years old he stumbled and fell while playing in his sand box, hitting his head. He then sees his dog barking at something and goes into the forest to investigate, despite having been told by his parents not to go into the forest. When he approaches the dog, he sees that he is barking at a tiny, strangely dressed creature. The creature says he is a wood elf named Pick. Jack chases the dog off and frees Pick from the brush he had become entangled in. Pick then shrinks Jack down to his size and they go for a ride on Pick's owl, Daniel. Jack sees the entire forest from above, and Pick points out a troll under the bridge. He also shows Jack a tree where a dragon named Desperado is being imprisoned. They land and Jack hears his mom call him, he turns to look and when he turns back Pick is gone. Later he searches for the tree where Desperado is imprisoned, and the troll, but finds nothing. He tells his mother about it, but she says that it is normal for kids his age to have imaginary friends, and that he should keep them to himself.\nLater, after his medical diagnosis, he tells his friend Waddy that he has been given 6 months to live, but Waddy tells him that he’ll probably beat the cancer. That night, unable to sleep, Jack hears someone calling for him outside. He runs outside, but trips over the dog and falls off the porch, bumping his head again. He then runs into the forest and finds Pick locked in a cage hanging from the troll bridge, but the troll is gone. Pick tells Jack that the troll has gone to release Desperado from his prison and that he must stop him. Jack runs to the tree and picks up a trash can lid and branch that magically become a shield and sword. The troll is lying on the ground, burnt. The dragon is huge and is made up of all Jack's doubt, fears and sickness. He runs from him, but the dragon is everywhere he turns. Finally he resolves to fight the dragon and beats it back into its prison. He then awakes in the hospital, where his parents tell him they found him lying outside unconscious. During his stay, more tests are run and they find that all traces of the cancer are gone. Waddy tells Jack he knew he would beat it, but Jack knows that it was defeating the dragon that destroyed the sickness.\n\n\n== Characters ==\nThe characters are: \nJack – a 13-year-old boy, recently diagnosed with cancer and given 6 months to live.\nWaddy – Jack’s best friend.\nPick – a tiny wood elf.\nDesperado – a dragon trapped by magic in a tree in the park forest.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nSylas K. Barrett of Reactor writes \"both traditional fairy tales and many modern children’s stories are designed to teach lessons to children, lessons about greed, or not trusting strangers, or how to face the trials of growing up. They can also provide tools to help children face those trials, and that is clearly what Brooks designed “Imaginary Friends\" to do.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSpeakman Press |Imaginary Friends by Terry Brooks – Amazon webpage for Imaginary Friends eBook.\nTerry Brooks Official Website",

        "content": "Northern Montenegro (Montenegrin: Śever Crne Gore / Ćевер Црне Горе), is one of three statistical regions in Montenegro. It encompasses the sparsely populated mountainous part of Montenegro. It is bordered by Bosnia and Herzegovina to the northwest, Serbia to the northeast, Kosovo to the east, Albania to the southeast and central region of Montenegro to the south. It comprises thirteen municipalities and is the largest by area.\n\n\n== Municipalities ==\n\nNorthern Montenegro comprises thirteen municipalities. Municipalities in Northern Montenegro include: Andrijevica, Berane, Bijelo Polje, Gusinje, Kolašin, Mojkovac, Petnjica, Plav, Plužine, Pljevlja, Rožaje, Šavnik and Žabljak.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe northern region of Montenegro is primarily rural, with a population that tends to be smaller and more dispersed compared to urban areas. It's known for its mountainous terrain, with towns and villages scattered throughout. The largest town by population is Pljevlja, while the largest municipality is Bijelo Polje. Demographically, it includes a mix of Montenegrins, Serbs, Bosniaks, Albanians and other ethnic groups, with a significant portion of the population identifying as Orthodox Christian and Muslim.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nList of current mayors and local governments\n  Democratic Party of Socialists (3)\n  New Serb Democracy (3)\n  Bosniak Party (2)\n  Socialist People's Party (2)\n  Social Democrats (1) \n  Democratic Montenegro (1) \n  Durmitorska Inicijativa (1)\n\n\n== Environment ==\n\n\n=== National Parks ===\nThere are three national parks in Northern Montenegro: Durmitor, Biogradska gora and Prokletije. Durmitor is part of World Heritage Site.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\n\nWithin Montenegro, the largest concentration of large animals can be found within the north of the country. These higher numbers can be attributed to the areas being mountainous and containing a virgin forest. Brown bears can be found within this area of Montenegro, living within Biogradska Gora national park. There are estimated to be less than 130 individuals living in the wild. These bears are known to reach a weight of up to 200 kg and generally remain docile except for mating season.\nOther carnivores such as wolves and Balkan lynxes live in the virgin forest as well, remaining distant from urban areas, this excludes occasional issues occurring from wolves hunting livestock. The Balkan Lynx along with other European species of lynx, remains critically endangered and there have been efforts from environmental organisations to increase protection and prevent extinction of the species. The Balkan lynx has an estimated population of between 40 and 70 individuals in the wild.\nAmong these larger carnivores is the golden jackal, wild dogs that retain a more slender build and lighter coat than wolves. Northern Montenegro has two predominant species of deer, these are the red deer and the roe deer. Alongside these fauna in the mountains is the Balkan Chamois, a small mountain goat native to the Balkan mountain regions.   Domesticated animals include large numbers of rabbits and livestock.\nThe Durmitor National Park is home to the Musor rock lizard and the sharp snouted lizard. Both species are native to Montenegro.\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nMontenegro\nStatistical regions of Montenegro\nMunicipalities of Montenegro\nGeography of Montenegro\nNational parks of Montenegro\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Albert Gumble (September 10, 1883 – November 30, 1946) was an American composer, pianist, music arranger, and songwriter. After graduating from the Auditorium School of Music in Cincinnati, he lived and worked briefly in Chicago during the early years of the twentieth century before moving to New York City where he worked as a Tin Pan Alley composer of ragtime pieces and songs. As a songwriter he was particularly associated with dixie tunes. He also was a prolific music arranger and contributed music to several Broadway musicals. From 1938 until his death in 1946 he was a resident pianist at the Ansonia Hotel.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nAlbert Gumble was born in North Vernon, Indiana on September 10, 1883. He was the younger brother of pianist, songwriter, and publisher Moses Edwin Gumble. He was educated at the Auditorium School of Music (later known as the Ohio Conservatory of Music) in Cincinnati where he was a pupil of Clarence Adler and Herman Froehlich. After graduating, he moved to Chicago where he began composing in early 1900s. He moved to New York City where Tin Pan Alley publisher Joseph W. Stern published his first rag, \"Kentucky Beauty\" (1904), a piece co-written with Monroe Rosenfeld. He composed several more rags for the music publisher Jerome H. Remick, including the \"Bolo Rag\" (1908), \"Minstrel Band Rag\" (1909), \"Georgia Rag\" (1910), and \"Red Fox Trot\" (1917).In addition to composing rags for Tin Pan Alley, Gumble also simultaneously worked as a songwriter. Scholar John Bush Jones stated that \"Between 1909 and 1919 Albert Gumble seems to have made a career out of writing the music for nineteen dixie tunes with words by ten different lyricists.\" Some of his dixie songs published by Jerome H. Remick included \"Lady Love\" (1909, lyricist William M. McKenna), \"At The Missippi Cabaret\" (1914, lyricist A. Seymour Brown, recorded by the American Quartet), \"Circus Day in Dixie\" (1915, lyricist Jack Yellen)  \"Welcome Honey To Your Own Plantation Home\" (1917, lyricist Yellen, recorded by Al Jolson), \"So This is Dixie\" (1917, lyricist Yellen), \"Southern Gals\" (1917, lyricist Yellen), and \"There's A Lump of Sugar Down in Dixie\" (1918, lyricists Alfred Bryan and Yellen; recorded by Al Jolson). Music publisher Leo Feist published another dixie medley by Gumble and Yellen, \"There's Nothing Sweeter Than A Girl From Dixieland\" (1917).Gumble also wrote other kinds of popular songs for Tin Pan Alley most of which were also published by Remick, but also some works which were self-published. The most successful of these were the songs \"The Girl Who Threw Me Down\" (1907, lyricist Benjamin Hapgood Burt), \"Are You Sincere?\" (1908, lyricist Alfred Bryan), and \"Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm\" (1914, lyricist Seymour Brown).  \"Are You Sincere?\" was a hit song for Elise Stevenson who recorded the work for the Victor Talking Machine Company in 1908. His romantic ballad \"On Lake Champlain\", about two lovers who are paddling by moonlight at midnight on the North American Lake, was published in the 2009 anthology New York Sings: 400 Years of the Empire State In Song.\nGumble also wrote music for Broadway. He contributed some instrumental music to Harold Atteridge and Sigmund Romberg's 1918 musical Sinbad at the Winter Garden Theatre, and his song \"Peachie\" (lyricist Yellen) was written for Act 2 of the musical revue Frivolities of 1920 at the 44th Street Theatre. His greatest contribution to musical theatre was co-writing the score to Red Pepper with Owen Murphy. Red Pepper used lyrics by Howard Emmett Rogers and was staged at the Shubert Theatre in 1922. Gumble and Murphy's score was rooted in jazz at a time when musical fashion on Broadway was just beginning to shift in that direction. Their forward thinking score shocked the reviewer in the New York Post who criticized their music for its embrace of that music genre.Gumble continued to publish music with Remick through 1928 after which he worked as a staff composer and arranger for Donaldson, Douglas, and Gumble which was co-founded by his brother and songwriters Walter Donaldson and Walter Douglas. In the 1930s his career slowly shifted away from composing and arranging into piano playing. In 1938 he took a position as resident pianist at the Ansonia Hotel in Manhattan where he remained until hid death eight years later.Albert Gumble died on November 30, 1946, in New York City. He and his wife, Florence Loraine Simmons, whom he married in 1915, had one son together, Albert Gumble Jr.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBenjamin, Ruth; Rosenblatt, Arthur (2006).

        "content": "On July 5, 2011, clashes broke out between Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and Mauritanian forces in Bassikounou, Mauritania.   \n\n\n== Background ==\nBetween 2005 and 2011, Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) had a stronghold in the Wagadou forest on the border between Mali and Mauritania. On June 24, 2011, Malian and Mauritanian forces launched an offensive on AQIM in the forest to finally dislodge the group, killing several jihadists. \n\n\n== Battle ==\nAccording to a resident of Bassikounou, occupants of a car on the way to Vasaala raised the alarm about an imminent jihadist incursion. The car was stopped by an AQIM checkpoint about ten kilometers outside of the city but were released. Mauritanian soldiers were then dispatched to confront the checkpoint. Clashes broke out between the two groups at 4pm. They exchanged artillery and heavy weapons fire for an hour, with the jihadists withdrawing before Mauritanian airpower arrived. Mauritanian forces set out in pursuit of the jihadists, with the air force shooting several jihadists. \nFighting ended around 7pm, with a city official stating he saw three vehicles destroyed. In a statement, AQIM stated that the attack was in retaliation for the raid on Wagadou. \n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe Mauritanian Army announced in a press release that six jihadists were killed. The release clarified that \"around 4:30pm, an enemy column made up of over 20 vehicles was surrounded by heavy fire from our units. Six fighters were killed during the clash; one left on the battlefield, two burned in their vehicle, and three others near Gataa El Gam. There are strong indications a large number of terrorists were injured. Alhamdulillah, no material or human losses were in our ranks.\" \nA local official in Bassikounou stated fifteen jihadists were killed, nine were taken prisoner, and two vehicles were destroyed. The same source stated that three Mauritanian soldiers were injured. AQIM claimed only two deaths within their ranks, and that none of their men were captured. A military source contacted by AFP stated that twenty jihadists were killed, and four soldiers were injured. \nIn a 2017 interview, General Mohamed Ould Ghazouani stated that at Bassikounou, the Algerian emir of AQIM was killed, and the battle also marked the first time that AQIM left their dead on the ground.  \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Scramble for China, also known as the partition of China or the scramble for concessions, was a concept that existed during the late 1890s in Europe and the United States for the partitioning of China under the Qing dynasty as their own spheres of influence, during the era of \"New Imperialism\". However, the United States Secretary of State created the Open Door Policy in 1899 which sought to prevent the European powers from trying to carve up China into colonies and proposed that all interested powers had equal access to China. The policy was gradually accepted by the major powers so that the concept of the partitioning of China generally lost favor by the early 20th century.\nChinese press routinely described the scramble as the \"carving up of the melon\" (瓜分), and modern Chinese writers usually consider such events in China part of the century of humiliation that began with the First Opium War (1839–1842) and ended with China established as a great power in 1945 or the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. Marxist historians in China considered China during this period a semi-colony because of the domination by the Western countries. On the other hand, the Scramble for Africa by the Western European powers also appeared around the same time, which resulted in the direct colonization of almost all of the African continent by 1914.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Qing dynasty reached its peak during the 18th century, with a large population and territory. Until the early 19th century, the internal areas of the Qing dynasty China had little influence from European powers. At that time, the Qing government only allowed Western European countries to conduct any trade with China in Guangzhou under the Canton System. But as new technology began to unbalance the relationship in the 19th century, foreigners gradually gathered around the declining Qing Empire. The great powers such as Britain that won the Opium Wars initially only demanded the creation of a new framework for China's foreign relations and overseas trade, including privileges such as extraterritoriality and treaty ports. But with China's defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War and the signing of the humiliating Treaty of Shimonoseki with the Empire of Japan in 1895, China was considered the \"Sick man of Asia\", and the ambitions of the great powers to compete for spheres of influence in China were greatly stimulated.\nIn 1897, Germany demanded and was given a set of exclusive mining and railroad rights in Shandong, along with the lease of Jiaozhou Bay. Russia obtained access to Dairen and Port Arthur and the right to build a railroad across Manchuria, along with the lease of Liaodong. The United Kingdom and France also received a number of concessions, including the British lease of the New Territories of Hong Kong and the French lease of Guangzhouwan. At this time, much of China was divided up into \"spheres of influence\": Germany had influence in Shandong and the Yellow River valley; Russia had influence in the Liaodong Peninsula and Manchuria; the United Kingdom had influence in Weihaiwei and the Yangtze Valley; France had influence in the provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangdong and Guangxi; and Japan also had influence in Fujian.\nAs the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions wrote in 1898, Europe's current scramble for China was much like her scramble for Africa, which had sparked many discussions since a few years ago; China's vulnerability was made clear to the world in its 1895 war with Japan, and her current state could encourage eagles to flock together; and they hadn't taken long to do this – Great Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and others had all staked claims and were aggressively advancing their projects.\nIn 1899, Italy also presented an ultimatum to the Chinese government, demanding the lease of Sanmen Bay in Zhejiang. However, this demand was sternly rejected by China. The Empress Dowager Cixi, the effective ruler of Qing China then decided that enough was enough and stated at a palace meeting that \"not a single piece of loess will be given to the Italians\", and such policy ultimately forced Italy to give up any claim to China's coast. The Chinese justified their refusal by arguing that Italy had no genuine political or economic stakes in China. And indeed the Italian demand to emulate the major nations was mostly motivated by concerns of prestige. However, it was said that the result was that Italy \"was made to appear a third or fourth-rate power\". The fiasco was an embarrassment for Italy, which was still stung by its defeat at the hands of the Ethiopian Empire in the Battle of Adowa in 1896. Such event in China also dispelled any idea of second-rate powers at that time like the Netherlands or Denmark taking the opportunity to participate in the Scramble for China.\nThe fact that China being humiliated by foreign powers caused strong xenophobia inside the country and became the fuse of the Boxer Rebellion, an uprising against foreigners and Christians that occurred in China around 1900, begun by peasants but eventually supported by the Qing government under the Empress Dowager Cixi. Cixi issued an imperial decree in the name of Guangxu Emperor that was a de facto declaration of war on the invading powers, who in turn formed a multinational military coalition known as the Eight-Nation Alliance which invaded northern China and defeated the \"Boxers\". With the success of the invasion, the later stages developed into a punitive colonial expedition, which pillaged the capital Beijing and North China for more than a year. The fighting ended in 1901 with the signing of the Boxer Protocol.\n\nChina continued to be divided up into these spheres until the United States, which had no sphere of influence in China and only recently acquired the Philippines from Spain, grew alarmed at the possibility of its businessmen being excluded from Chinese markets. To prevent the \"carving of China like a melon\", as the European powers were doing in Africa at the time, the U.S. Secretary of State John Hay created the Open Door Policy that called for a system of equal trade and investment and to guarantee the territorial integrity of Qing China, and circulated a note known as the \"Open Door Note\" (dated September 6, 1899) to the major European powers. The Note asked the powers to keep China open to trade with all countries on an equal basis and called upon all powers, within their spheres of influence to refrain from interfering with any treaty port or any vested interest, to permit Chinese authorities to collect tariffs on an equal basis, and to show no favors to their own nationals in the matter of harbor dues or railroad charges.\nThe Open Door policy was then accepted only grudgingly, if at all, by the major powers, and it had no legal standing or enforcement mechanism. Each country tried to evade Hay's request by taking the position that it could not commit itself until the other nations had complied. However, by July 1900, Hay announced that each of the powers had granted its consent in principle. Although treaties after 1900 referred to the Open Door Policy, competition continued abated among the various powers for special concessions within China for railroad rights, mining rights, loans, foreign trade ports, and so forth. On October 6, 1900, Britain and Germany signed the Yangtze Agreement to oppose the partition of China into spheres of influence. The agreement, signed by Lord Salisbury and Ambassador Paul von Hatzfeldt, was an endorsement of the Open Door Policy. The Germans supported it because a partition of China would limit Germany to a small trading market, instead of all of China. Over the next decades, American policy-makers and national figures continued to refer to the Open Door Policy as a basic doctrine, which stopped the European powers from carving up China into colonies, but did allow them to establish spheres of influence.\n\n\n== See also ==\nWestern imperialism in Asia\nForeign concessions in China\nCentury of humiliation\nEight-Nation Alliance\nScramble for Africa\nSick man of Asia\nOpen Door Policy\n\n\n== References ==",

Her work focuses on the problems of education and training of younger generations, family policy, immigration issues and French foreign policy.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in Marseille, daughter of Algerian immigrants parents, Malika Sorel-Sutter completed her primary and secondary studies in the French educational system and moved to Algeria when she was ten years old. She moved back to France at 25. She is an engineer from École Polytechnique d'Algiers and has an MBA from Sciences Po (1996). After working in executive recruiting for the high-tech sector, she began writing about social issues, such as immigration issues and about French foreign policy.On 4 September 2009, she was appointed, by Nicolas Sarkozy, as a member of the Superior Council for Integration created by Michel Rocard in 1989, a position she held until the dissolution of this council by François Hollande on 24 December 2012.N. Beau, associate professor at the Maghreb Institute at Paris University, notes that her positions are published on sites such as, among others, Riposte Laïque, and that his blog is regularly cited by far-right sites, which the identity bloc “gives its panegyric” and qualifies it as a “fundamentalist of secularism”.On 24 March 2024, Malika Sorel announces that she will join the National Rally list led by Jordan Bardella for the 2024 European elections, as second in the RN list.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Eugène Pons, born in Saint-Étienne on May 15, 1886, and deported to the Neuengamme concentration camp on February 24, 1945, was a Catholic figure from Lyon, and a French printer and Resistance fighter who specialized in printing underground newspapers. From 1940 to 1944, at his printing works on rue de la Vieille-Monnaie, he was responsible for printing Resistance newspapers, Témoignage chrétien, Combat, La Marseillaise and Franc-tireur. He was also responsible for the 25,000 copies of Le Faux Nouvelliste on December 31, 1943. Defending one of his print shop employees, he was arrested in May 1944 and deported to Neuengamme, where he died of exhaustion in 1945.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nEugène Pons was the son of Claudine Jay, a schoolteacher from Saint-Héand, and Victor Pons (1847–1928), a journalist. His mother died when he was very young. He developed a strong spirituality from an early age, which led him to join Sillon, the Catholic movement founded by Marc Sangnier, in his teens.He married Rose-Adrienne Lavarière in Caluire-et-Cuire on January 28, 1913, while living in the Bissardon district. His wife, an embroiderer, lived on rue Diderot in Lyon. Their first child, Marcel Pons, was born on January 13, 1913.In 1914, he was called up to fight in the First World War, joining the 371st infantry regiment. He was sent to Greece to take part in the Salonika expedition, during which he contracted malaria.Eugène Pons returned to Lyon in 1918. He soon found work as an accountant in an umbrella factory. He then worked in the same capacity for a fruit and vegetable company.\n\n\n=== Interwar period ===\nOn his return from the war, Eugène Pons resumed his spiritual activities with the Sillon group in Lyon, formed before the war. In this movement, he rediscovered his profound orientation towards social Catholicism. Indeed, Le Sillon, founded in 1894 by Marc Sangnier, aims not only to offer a response to Pope Leo XIII's encyclical Rerum novarum, advocating greater openness of the Church towards the world, but also, and more prosaically, to bring Catholicism closer to the working world by offering a political and spiritual alternative to communism.\n\nHe also became involved in politics, joining the Ligue de la jeune République, a political party also founded by Marc Sangnier. Locally, it aimed to oppose Édouard Herriot's all-powerful and rather anti-clerical radical-socialist party. Eugène Pons soon organized Lyon meetings at his home on rue Denfert-Rochereau, attended by Joseph Folliet and Sylvie Mingeolet (1903–1955). The various gatherings of the Lyonnais group enabled them to socialize with invited personalities such as Paul Claudel.His daily life and that of his family revolved around the Catholic faith and prayer. He took part in parish activities at Notre-Dame-Saint-Alban church and later at Saint-Eucher church in Lyon. Pilgrimage was also an important part of his life: he made an annual pilgrimage to the Basilica of Ars to pay homage to the Curé d'Ars. Another frequent pilgrimage was between La Croix-Rousse and Fourvière hill after work.\nIn Saint-Alban, Eugène Pons assisted Abbé Laurent Remillieux (1882–1949), the founder of the parish. Among other things, he helped him organize educational activities for the Jeunesse ouvrière chrétienne.Eugène Pons was also an accomplished sportsman. He was a member of the Le Patriote sports club, which depended on the parish church of Saint-Denis-de-la-Croix-Rousse, and excelled at rifle shooting. He also swam down the Rhône several times across Lyon.Eugène Pons seized a business opportunity that came to him through his friend Georges Neveu. Victor Carlhian acquired the Imprimerie de la Source at 21 rue de la Vieille-Monnaie and was looking for a manager. He recruited Eugène Pons for the job, and Pons became the printer. He was in charge of printing various philosophical and ecumenical brochures and newspapers. By 1940, Eugène Pons was managing a team of some twenty people working in the print shop.\n\n\n== World War II ==\n\n\n=== Resistance ===\nAs early as 1940, Eugène Pons considered joining London, but given his family responsibilities, he chose to join the Resistance. His first actions in the Resistance were to print leaflets he had written himself, appealing to Christian values. He immediately accepted a request from the communist resistance fighter André Liebherr to print communist leaflets, since the enemy, in his view, was above all Nazism.In May 1941, at Jean Stetten-Bernard's request, Eugène Pons printed a leaflet explaining that the French people did not want to collaborate. He completed the job in one night.In early 1942, Henri Chevalier decided to stop printing Franc-tireur at his printing works at 40 cours de la Liberté, probably for ideological reasons. Eugène Pons immediately took over the printing of the paper. He also worked regularly for André Bollier, printing the newspaper Combat. He also regularly printed the newspaper La Marseillaise.He subsequently took on the task of printing the journal Témoignage chrétien. While the first two issues were printed in Villeurbanne by Joseph Martinet, Eugène Pons took charge of all subsequent issues, starting with No. 3 in March 1942, at the joint request of Père Chaillet and Louis Cruvillier. Louis Besacier, who was in charge of binding the newspapers, took over the printing of Témoignage chrétien when Eugène Pons was arrested in May 1944.Until his arrest in 1944, the daytime activity of the printing works was quite ordinary: Eugène Pons and his employees printed a variety of brochures with complete legality. At night, on Saturdays and Sundays, the printing works are dedicated to printing underground newspapers. He was sometimes assisted by some of his employees, in particular, foreman Verrier, workers Charles Planchet (b. 1896), and his son-in-law Pierre Barnier (1920–1997), who was working at the printing works at the time.On December 31, 1943, with the help of his son-in-law Pierre Barnier, he printed 25,000 copies of the Faux Nouvelliste a forged copy of the collaborationist newspaper Le Nouvelliste.\nHe had also been printing false papers for the Resistance since at least the beginning of 1942. This is confirmed by the testimony of resistance fighter Adrien Némoz, who writes:\n\"In 1940, Eugène Pons began printing whatever was asked of him. From memory, I can cite: France-Tireur, the clandestine Nouvelliste, false identity cards, passes authorizing the movement of people and goods, and at the beginning of 1942 the notebooks of Témoignage chrétien.\"\nIt also details Eugène Pons' humanist and spiritual motivations for joining the Resistance:\n\"At the turn of the century, his encounter with Marc Sangnier's Le Sillon [...] had convinced him that the Christian faith should inspire men's actions. Eugène Pons' resistance had both patriotic and spiritual motives [...] and it was essential to prevent the victorious Nazis from imposing their anti-Christian mysticism on the world.\"\n\n\n=== Arrest and deportation ===\nThe Gestapo inspected the printing works at around midday on May 21 or May 22, 1944. No clandestine printed matter was found, although it seems that copies of Témoignage chrétien were on the premises. A worker, Charles Lang, of Alsatian origin, took charge of the translation. Once the inspection was complete, the Gestapo decided to take Charles Lang away on suspicion of being a German. Eugène Pons objected, demanding that his employee remain in the print shop as nothing incriminating had been found. In the end, it was both men - Charles Lang and Eugène Pons - who were taken away by the Gestapo.Eugène Pons was first taken to Montluc prison, then sent to the Royallieu camp. On July 15, 1944, he was deported by train to the Neuengamme concentration camp. Charles Lang (born January 7, 1907, in Lyon) was also deported to Neuengamme, where he died on December 30, 1944.Adrien Némoz was present at the printing works on the day Eugène Pons was arrested: the previous two days had been taken up with printing a booklet for Témoignage Chrétien entitled \"Exigences de la libération\". He left the premises fifteen minutes before the arrival of the Gestapo.The Resistance quickly organized a rescue operation. Henri Frenay explains: under the direction of André Bollier, the sheets already printed, certain machine parts and sheets of blank paper are recovered from rue de la Vieille-Monnaie and transferred to rue Viala, where another clandestine printing work is located.\n\n\n=== Neuengamme ===\nEugène Pons arrived at Neuengamme after four days on the train. In addition to the concentration camp environment, the inhuman conditions, the deprivation of food, and the physical violence of the guards, prisoners were required to work twelve hours a day: Eugène Pons was first assigned to transport stones on the canal, then to the braiding workshop where hair was transformed into ropes.Dominican priest Claude Humbert (matricule 33221) met Eugène Pons at Neuengamme: they exchanged a few times through a grate. They prayed for the soldiers of Lyon and France, reciting the rosary of Simon the Zealot.Eugène Pons, matricule 36921, died of exhaustion on February 24, 1945. The last person to see him alive was Maître Périssé, a lawyer in Toulouse, himself a prisoner at Neuengamme.\n\n\n== Family ==\nEugène Pons and Rose-Adrienne Lavarière (1888–1973) had seven children, two of whom died in infancy:\nMarcel Pons (January 13, 1913, in Caluire-et-Cuire - April 22, 2002, in Toulon), vicar and author of the biography of Eugène Pons;\nGeorges Pons (February 10, 1915 - 1916);\nAlbert Pons (June 22, 1916 - December 4, 1920);\nThérèse Barnier, born Thérèse Pons (October 1920 - 1997), wife of Pierre Barnier (1920–1997), Médaille de la Résistance;\nMarie-Claude Thomasset, born Marie-Claude Pons;\nHélène Canard, born Hélène Pons (1925 - 2003);\nAndré Pons (1930–2003).\n\n\n== Tributes and awards ==\nEugène Pons was posthumously awarded the Resistance medal, the Legion of Honor and the Croix de Guerre (with palms) in 1945.\nA plaque is affixed to the premises where his printing works - l'Imprimerie de la Source - were located at 21 rue Vieille-Monnaie (now rue René-Leynaud).\nThere's a rue Eugène-Pons in Lyon. This long, steep street links the Cours d'Herbouville (which runs alongside the Rhône on its right bank) to Rue Artaud, and provides pedestrian access to the Croix-Rousse plateau from the Winston-Churchill bridge. It was formerly known as rue de Dijon, and rue Lafayette under the Second Empire. It was renamed following a decision by Lyon's city council on November 26, 1945. At the same meeting, the city council decided to affix the plaque at 21 rue Vieille-Monnaie, where the Imprimerie de la Source was located, as well as the home of the Pons family.His name is also inscribed on a collective plaque inside Lyon's Saint-Eucher church. Opposite the church gate on rue des Actionnaires is an Eugène-Pons basketball court.There's also an avenue Eugène-Pons in Beauchamp, Val-d'Oise, in a residential neighborhood where street names are dedicated to famous members of the French Resistance.\n\n\n=== Testimonies ===\nEugène Pons' wife, Rose-Adrienne Lavarière, reportedly told their children the day after their father's arrest:\n\"France cannot be liberated without martyrs. If the Good Lord had wanted to choose Daddy to be one of them, it would be terrible, but we should be proud.\"\nAfter the war, churchman Pierre Chaillet considered Eugène Pons to be \"the noblest figure; one who inspires respect and friendship; one of the most valiant and discreet heroes of the Resistance\". Resistance fighter Eugène Claudius-Petit expressed his esteem for Pons in the February 27, 1970 issue of Témoignage chrétien in an article entitled \"A man at peace...\", which he concluded as follows:\n\"We still have his friendship, and when the smells of ink, paper and hot machines mingle with the muffled, cadenced noises of the heavy platens, you're there my old Pons to tell us what a man is.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nFrench resistance\nEugène Claudius-Petit\nHenri Frenay\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nPons, Marcel (1991).

        "content": "The Skaar Invasion is a 2018 fantasy novel by Terry Brooks, the second installment in his Fall of Shannara series.\n\n\n== Plot summary ==\nThe novel picks up where The Black Elfstone left off. Darcon (Dar) Leah holds Ajin d’Amphere hostage, the Druids are dead, and Paranor has vanished. Ajin tells Dar that the Skaar invaded the Four Lands because their continent of Eurodia is dying, caught in an endless winter. They eliminated the Druids because they found them to be the biggest threat to their invasion, but she had meant to capture the magic of Paranor for Skaarsland. She had not anticipated Paranor vanishing and feels like a failure because it is gone. Feeling that he owes her for saving his own life, Dar allows Ajin to go free and she returns to the Skaar. Kol’Dre, in private musings, reveals that the Skaar ability to disappear is at least partly due to their genetic makeup. Ajin receives a message from her father, the king, that he is coming. She sends Kol’Dre to the Federation Prime Minister, Ketter Vause. Kol’Dre tells Vause of how the Skaar have destroyed tribes of Trolls and eliminated the Druids. He informs him that the Elves are next and suggests a non-intervention treaty between the Federation and the Skaar. Meanwhile, Ajin goes to the Elves and lies, telling them that they eliminated the Druids on behalf of the Federation. She now reveals that the Federation intends to attack the Elves and take all of their magic talismans, also a lie to pit the two against each other. She tells the Elven king and council that the Skaar only seek a new homeland and asks that the Elves not interfere with how they go about it or give aid to the Federation. In exchange, Ajin assures the king that the Skaar will not harm the Elves or their lands. The Elves agree to the alliance.\nDrisker Arc finds himself trapped in limbo inside Paranor. He is visited by the shade of Cogline, who is also trapped inside Paranor as a sort of shadow of his former self. Cogline reveals that he transported the Black Elfstone into Drisker's pocket, taking it from Clizia Porse. Drisker discovers that he also has the scrye orb, but that Clizia Porse has taken the Stiehl Blade, a magical knife that can cut through anything. Cogline reveals that a price will be required of Drisker to allow him to use the Black Elfstone to restore Paranor to the land of the living but does not reveal what that price is. Drisker makes many unsuccessful attempts to use the Black Elfstone to restore Paranor.\nClizia Porse travels with a goods caravan, musing about how she destroyed the Druid Order to form a new Druid Order with herself as Ard Rhys, leader of the druids. She discovers that the Black Elfstone is missing, and she now has no way to return Paranor from limbo. She travels to Drisker's cottage to find the books of old magic he kept there to see if they have anything in them that could help her restore Paranor.\nTarsha Kaynin returns home only to find that it has been burned to the ground. The villagers chase her away, and tell her never to return, fearful that she will use her magic to harm them as well. Outside of town, an old woman tells Tarsha that the townspeople burned her parents house down after her brother Tavo left. She reveals that Tavo murdered their parents and many other people, tearing them apart with his evil form of Wishsong. She tells Tarsha which direction he traveled, and Tarsha heads off to find him. On her travels, she is attacked by three bandits. She uses the Wishsong to defend herself but is cut during the attack and the wound festers. She travels to Drisker's cottage where she finds Clizia Porse. Clizia heals her wounds. While Tarsha is asleep, Clizia Porse contacts Drisker Arc with the scrye orb. She tells him that if he returns Paranor to the real world that she will not harm Tarsha. Drisker Arc uses magic to contact Tarsha in spirit form. He warns her that Clizia Porse is the one that destroyed the druids and banished Paranor into limbo along with him inside. He tells her to find Dar Leah.\nDar travels to Arborlon and warns his friend Brecon Elessedil not to trust Ajin d’Amphere. He reveals that it was a druid, Clizia Porse, that betrayed the druids and sent Paranor into limbo. He convinces Brecon to \"borrow\" the blue seeking elfstones and help him find Tarsha Kaynin. They learn she is in Drisker Arc's cottage and head there. Tavo has also learned this and reaches the cottage first where he tries to kill Tarsha and almost succeeds. Clizia Porse intervenes and convinces him not to kill her until she can make use of her. In exchange she will teach him how to control his magic and become more powerful. He agrees, but in reality, she wants to use his powerful magic to kill Drisker Arc. Dar and Brecon reach the cottage where they meet the forest Imp, Flinc, and his moor cat, Fade. They rescue Tarsha and leave Clizia Porse and Tavo unconscious, but during the fight, Flinc disappears with Tarsha. Brecon uses the blue elfstones to track them down. Flinc takes Tarsha to his underground home in the forest, but Clizia Porse and Tavo quickly find them. Flinc sends Tarsha down a tunnel while he confronts the two. The faerie creature blows himself up, sending poison darts into his enemies. Clizia Porse uses a spell to heal herself and Tavo.\nKetter Vause discovers that the Skaar invasion force is camped on the north shore of the Mermidon River. He wonders about the Skaar's intentions, and how reliable Kol’Dre's assurances were. He orders two companies to the south shore of the river. The Skaar then forge a letter to the company commander from Ketter Vause ordering them to attack. They send their troop transport airships across the river, but they had been sabotaged by the Skaar before takeoff, and they crash to the ground, killing the troops aboard. Meanwhile, the Skaar army flanks and attacks the soldiers remaining in the Federation encampment, executing a decisive victory. Ajin then has the Federation commander executed. Ketter Vause learns of the attack and orders the Fifth Army and its airship fleet to the battlefront to wipe out the Skaar. Ajin flies to the Elven king and tells him the Skaar were attacked without provocation and pleads with him to send the Elven Army to fight the Federation with the Skaar, but he does not send their army. Ajin learns that Sten’Or has been spying for the Pretender. He tells her that her father is merely the Pretender's puppet at this point, and Ajin fears that the Skaar Army will not come to aid her advance force that is sure to be greatly outnumbered by the Federation's Fifth Army, but the Skaar Army arrives just in time.\nA gambler in Varfleet named Rocan Arneas employs a young street orphan named Shea Ohmsford to help him out of a deadly situation with some other gamblers. Impressed with his skills, Rocan asks Shea if he would like to accompany him to Arishaig to help him with something, and Shea agrees. Rocan introduces Shea to his companion Seelah, a beautiful, catlike, shapeshifting faerie creature that can turn invisible. In Arishaig, they are confronted by Commander Zakonis and his soldiers, but Seelah attacks them, and they escape. They battle bandits as they make their way through the city to Rocan's other hideout, a warehouse that contains the weather-controlling machine called Annabelle. Rocan had been financing a scientist called Tindall to build it. However, Tindall was arrested and is being held in the Assidian Deep prison as bait by Commander Zakonis to capture Rocan. Rocan then asks Shea to help him break Tindall out of prison. After Rocan pays off some prison guards to look the other way, Shea enters the prison through the sewers, using an acid-like substance to melt through locks, and bars as he makes his way to Tindall's cell.\nClizia Porse contacts Drisker once more using the scrye orb, and he declines her deal, knowing that Tarsha has escaped, and warns Clizia Porse that he is coming for her. Clizia then begins to train Tavo, while keeping him sedated for her own safety. She convinces him that he must help her kill Drisker Arc, and then he can kill Tarsha with the Stiehl Blade. They then head to Paranor anticipating its restoration. Drisker Arc reaches out to Tarsha in spirit form again and tells her to come to Paranor as well. He is beginning to fade in limbo, but he finally realizes what the price is that he must pay to use the Black Elfstone to restore Paranor. He must agree to become Ard Rhys, the High Druid, and start a Fifth Druid Order. He agrees and restores Paranor. While Paranor is restored through the Black Elfstone, Drisker is infused with the memories and knowledge of all of the past Druids and Druid Histories. As the novel closes, Clizia Porse sees Paranor restored, and sends Tavo down to kill Drisker Arc when he exits the keep. However, when Tavo sees his sister, he cannot resist killing her first and stabs her in the back with the Stiehl Blade.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nPublishers Weekly wrote that \"Although Brooks’s prose and characters remain unremarkable, he does a better job of juggling multiple story lines in this middle volume of his final Shannara epic fantasy trilogy than in its predecessor,\" and that the story remained accessible to readers unfamiliar with the rest of the series.\nAidan Moher of Reactor praised the book's handling of political themes like climate change and xenophobia, and considered it to be a \"classic installment\" in the series.\nThe book entered the The New York Times Best Seller list in July 2018.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Skaar Invasion by Terry Brooks – official webpage for the Del Rey eBook.",

        "content": "Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist is a 2024 Metroidvania video game developed by Adglobe and Live Wire and published by Binary Haze Interactive.  It was released in early access for Microsoft Windows on March 25, 2024.  Ender Magnolia is a sequel to the developers' previous game Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knights, set in the same world.  In Ender Magnolia the protagonist Lilac goes on a quest to purify the corrupted Homunculi that have overrun the kingdom.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nEnder Magnolia takes place decades after its predecessor Ender Lilies in the same world. The game is set in the land of fumes, where \"machine-like artificial life forms\" called Homunculi are built to serve the kingdom.  These Homunculi have become corrupted from an underground toxic gas, causing them to become violent and insane.  The protagonist Lilac is an “Attuner” with the ability to purify corrupted Homunculi.  Lilac teams up with a Homunculi named Nola and sets out to rescue the kingdom.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nEnder Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist is a 2D side-scrolling Metroidvania.  The player controls Lilac, who traverses the game world doing a mixture of platforming, exploration, and combat.  As the player progresses through the game, they collect upgrades and new abilities which enables them to access new parts of the game world.  Similar to Lily in the game's predecessor Ender Lilies, Lilac does not engage in combat directly, and instead summons Homunculi companions to fight in battle.  When Lilac defeats corrupted Homunculi in battle, they can be purified and turned into summonable allies.\n\n\n== Development ==\nEnder Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist was announced for Nintendo Switch with a trailer on February 21, 2024 during a Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase. It was later also confirmed for release on Microsoft Windows, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.\n\n\n=== Release ===\nEnder Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist was released in early access on Steam on \nMarch 25, 2024.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nReviewing the early access version on PC, Ryan Radcliff from RPGamer commented, \"Ender Magnolia feels like it will be a strong follow-up, and fans that want to enjoy challenging battles with tons of variety, along with fun rewards for exploration, should definitely mark this game on their wishlists.\" Chris Shive of Hardcore Gamer also had favorable impressions of the early access version, citing quality of life improvements over the previous game. Game Informer's Marcus Stewart praised the game's art direction and combat, while commenting that the lore was \"interesting.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

He served as an officer in the Imperial Russian Army. In 1912, on his initiative, a machine was brought to Azerbaijan from Germany for the first time to obtain flour. That car is currently kept as a monument in the neighboring village of Yemişanli.\nDuring the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, Garib Karimoglu was the chairman of the executive committee of Vartashen district of Sheki district. On December 15, 1918, Garib Karimoglu was elected a member of the Parliament of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic from Nukha district. He was a member of the Ahrar faction in the parliament. On April 24, 1919, he was elected a member of the Land Commission of the Parliament of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. On March 11, he resigned from his position due to illness.\nAfter Azerbaijan was occupied by the Bolsheviks, it gave all its wealth to the Bolsheviks. Although the Bolsheviks wanted to arrest him, the local population prevented it.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAXCE, II cild, Yagub, ed. (2005).

        "content": "The Fortifications of Den Helder form a circle of fortresses and other works that defended Den Helder in the Netherlands from the end of the 18th century till the end of World War II. They are now getting repurposed for tourism.\n\n\n== Introduction ==\nBy the late 18th century, Den Helder or better the Nieuwediep was an important harbor. Starting in 1810, it was fortified, creating the Fortifications of Den Helder known in Dutch as Stelling Den Helder. During the nineteenth century the fortifications were improved and expanded. During World War II, the fortifications were garrisoned by the German army. Post war, the fortifications were decommissioned between 1951 and 1957. They are now getting re-developed for tourism.\n\n\n== Early years ==\n\n\n=== Lessons and plans ===\nDuring the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Zuiderzee became ever shallower while ships became bigger. At the end of the 18th century, this led to the development of the Nieuwediep, as a canal and deep harbor. The harbor was important for the republic's navy as well as its commercial ships. However, further development was barred by the cities on the Zuiderzee fearing that their commerce might move to Nieuwediep.\n\nThe 1799 Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland was a part of the War of the Second Coalition. It started with a landing near Callantsoog, just south of Den Helder on 27 August. This became the Battle of Callantsoog, which the Dutch lost.\nAfter the defeat, Den Helder, or rather the harbor of Nieuwediep, was defended by two battalions. On its southern side Nieuwediep had an earth redoubt called 'Het Nieuwe Werk'. On the north side there was an old field fortification near the coast. There were 61 24-pdr guns and 22 lighter guns. However, these elements did not form a cohesive defensive position and so the two battalions were ordered to retreat. Without a possibility to use the coastal batteries to prevent the British fleet from appearing before Nieuwediep, the Dutch fleet retreated to the Vlieter. Cut off from its base, the Dutch fleet surrendered on 30 August 1799 in what became known as the Vlieter incident.\nIn 1807 king Louis Bonaparte visited the north of Holland and Texel and Nieuwediep. By then there were about a dozen warships in the harbor. Napoleon wanted to fortify the place, and transfer the Amsterdam navy base to Den Helder. The finances were the only problem. Indeed, King Louis regularly talked about the subject with Cornelis Krayenhoff, then director of fortifications in the department where Den Helder was located.\nKraijenhoff came with a plan to build: A fort at the Kijkduin dune, this would cover the Schulpengat, and allow mortars to cover the approaches to Nieuwediep; A brick fortress tower, tour-modèle behind the Kaaphoofd battery; another such tower at the southern end of Den Helder village; one more tower on the Sluisdijk; changing the Nieuwe Werk to a fortress; Building a fortress on top of the shoal De Laan. The estimated cost was about 2,000,000.\n\n\n=== Construction of the fortifications ===\nIn October 1811 Napoleon visited Den Helder and Texel. He decided to create a base for building, repairing and equipping warships near Den Helder, which became Willemsoord, Den Helder. Den Helder and the base would be protected by a string of fortifications, costing 6 million Francs. Soon the construction of Fort Kijkduin and Fort Erfprins started, and Erfprins was connected to the Kaaphoofd battery. Somewhat later, the construction of Fort Dirksz Admiraal began, and het Nieuwe Werk was changed to a fortress.\nDuring the revolt which led to the establishment of the Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands, the naval base of Den Helder was held by the French side. By then, the Fortifications of Den Helder consisted of:\n\nFort La Salle, later renamed Erfprins\nFort Morland, later Kijkduin\nFort L'Ecluse, later Dirksz Admiraal\nFort Du Gonnier, later Oost-Oever\nThe work on the Falga\nBattery La Révolution or l'Imperiale, later Kaap Hoofd\nBattery l'Indivisibilité, later Oost-Batterij\nOn 16 November 1813 commander Carel Hendrik Ver Huell declared Den Helder to be in a state of siege. Though not much was done in terms of besieging Den Helder, the siege lasted till 21 April 1814.\n\n\n== The time of wooden ships (1815-1862) ==\n\nIn February 1818, a commission was appointed to investigate the defense of Den Helder and the Naval base Willemsoord. While these were busy years for the Willemsoord navy base, not much seems to have happened at the Fortifications of Den Helder during these years. Het Nieuwe Werk was changed to become Fort Oostoever. In 1825 Fort Westoever was built.\n\n\n== Armor and modern artilery ==\n\n\n=== Armored ships ===\n\nThe 1862 Battle of Hampton Roads showed the power and near impregnability of armored ships. It sparked a wide interest in udating coastal defences.\nOn 3 June 1864, a new commission for coastal defense was appointed. It opted for the principle that harbors and roadsteads would be defended by fixed fortifications. These would be supported by supported by shallow draught armored vessels like rams and monitors. The commission clearly advised to buy some of the new heavy guns that were in use or development abroad. These were to be placed on turntables.\nFor Den Helder, the commission proposed to build four brick towers at: One at the shoal De Laan, One at De Hors, one at Harssens (at the end of the east dam of Nieuwediep) and one at the Zuidwal (the shoal stretching from the east dam of the Nieuwediep towards the east). These were to be armed each with 8-12 heavy guns in armored iron cupolas. The commission also advised to re-arm some of the existing works with heavy caliber guns. Most of these should be able to penetrate armor at a distance of 2,000 m.\nIn 1870 the fortress law asked for money for a fort on the Zuidwal. A decision that was described as grabbing something from the plan. However, the decision was overturned when the next minister opted for the fortress on De Laan.\n\n\n=== Modern artillery ===\nThe advancements in armor led to a speedy development of more powerful guns. This was the rifled breech loader constructed as a built-up gun. While the Dutch navy first standardized on the 9-inch Armstrong muzzle loader, the army looked to France and Germany. In 1870 the Dutch army got the 24 cm ijzer, an iron rifled breech loader based on a French model. Other guns that showed up in Den Helder were the 24 cm L/25 and the 24 cm K L/35.\n\n\n=== 1886 Fort Harssens ===\nIn 1879 Minister of War Den Beer Poortugael took the lead and secured money to build Fort Harssens. That same year construction began. While there were some doubts about the plan it was deemed to be realistic and effective. With its two armored cupolas with two Krupp 30.5 cm MRK L/25 each, Fort Harssens was something very different from the existing 19th century forts.\nApart from building Fort Harssens there were also some other modernizations. Between 1875 and 1878 Fort Erfprins was modernized. It got an underground barracks for about 1,000 men, protected against grenade fire. Erfprins also got emplacements for 24 cm guns.\n\n\n=== 1913 plans for Kijkduin ===\nJust before World War I, the Dutch government decided to modernize Fort Kijkduin. It was planned to get armored cupolas with the 28 cm SK L/45 gun gun. This was a modern powerful gun. However, critics warned that doing the minimum of what was required, would lead to a quick obsolescence of the fortress. Due to World War I, the plan was not executed.\n\n\n== The World Wars ==\nDuring World War I the Fortifications of Den Helder were manned by the mobilized Dutch army. By then, the fortresses and their heavy artillery might still have seemed impressive. In reality most of it was already obsolete in 1906. By then, guns like 24 cm ijzer and the 24 cm L/25 were completely useless against modern battleships. The only guns that were still dangerous to enemy capital ships were those of Fort Harssens.\nDuring the Interwar period the Dutch government severely economized on defense spending. Some new light caliber guns were put into service in the area, but with regard to big guns, nothing was done. In about 1930, the big guns of Fort Harssens were decommissioned. Just before World War II the fortifications and their guns no longer posed a serious threat to enemy warships.\nDuring World War II, the German army garrissoned the Fortifications of Den Helder. For Germany the base was important for the small craft of its navy and to protect coastal shipping. The Germans built a number of bunkers and anti-aircraft emplacements to protect their position.\n\n\n== Disarmament and tourism ==\nPost world war II, fortifications like those of Den Helder were completely obsolete. It meant that they were disarmed, but that did not mean that the buildings were immediately abandoned. While the army retreated from the fortresses, the Dutch navy expanded and could use some buildings. In 1950 the army transferred Fort Erfprins to the navy to use as a training facility. It also transferred other facilities. For some time it held on to Fort Dirks Admiraal.\nIn 1989 the foundaton \"Stichting Stelling Den Helder\" was founded. It aimed to preserve the fortifications of Den Helder. The first activities were guided tours at Fort Kijkduin, which also aimed to raise public awareness of the fortress. The end of the Cold War would lead to less work for the Dutch military, which the municipality tried to compensate by developing tourism. In 1992 the foundation became the owner of the fortress and in 1993 it got a subsidy of 7.2 million guilders to restore the fort. Fort Westoever would be next.\n\n\n== Elements of Stelling Den Helder ==\nThese are some parts of the Fortifications of Den Helder that are still more or less intact.\n\nFort Kijkduin\nFort Erfprins\nFort Dirks Admiraal\nFort Harssens\nFort Westoever\nFort Oostoever\nBatterij Kaaphoofd\nOostbatterij\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nStichting Stelling Den Helder\n\n\n== References ==\nAbcouwer, Caroline (23 November 1993). \"Straks gezellig dagje uit in Fort Kijkduin\".

        "content": "The Perfect Nanny is a 2001 American psychological thriller television film directed by Robert Malenfant. It stars Tracy Nelson, Bruce Boxleitner, Dana Barron and Katherine Helmond. It centers on a mentally disturbed woman who becomes obsessed with a man, and assumes a hidden identity in order to apply for the position of a nanny in his home, while she is ultimately determined to be his wife.\nThe film marks the second collaboration between Malenfant and Tracy Nelson, the first being the 1998 film, The Night Caller, in which Nelson played a similar role.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAndrea McBride discovers her husband in bed with another woman and attempts suicide by stabbing herself. Upon her release from a psychiatric hospital, Andrea decides to start fresh. While working for a nanny agency, Andrea comes across a client, widower, Dr. James Lewis, who is in need of a nanny. Driven by her fascination of romance novels, particularly \"The Passion of Mandy\", she applies for the job in an attempt to marry James, a similar theme which takes place in her favorite book. Under a new persona and a new physical appearance, Andrea becomes Nikki Harcourt, as she is told that she bares a strong resemblance to a woman of the same name who used to work with the agency, but has since relocated to Paris.\nNikki is initially rejected for the position, until she kills the successful applicant, Beth O'Reilly, and suddenly moves into the Lewis household, where she is welcomed by the family, including James's teenage daughter, Fawn, and son, Ben. Nikki, as well as Fawn, becomes jealous of James's relationship with colleague, Dr. Julia Bruning, forcing Nikki to resort to self-harm as a means of drawing James's attention away from Julia. Nikki then tries to convince Fawn that Julia is having an affair with another colleague, which turns out to be untrue. Nikki makes a desperate bid to have James for herself by murdering Julia, prompting Fawn to become suspicious of Nikki's intentions.\nNikki's husband, Troy, begins to enquire about her whereabouts, and asks for her estranged mother's help. Fawn continues to keep a watchful eye on Nikki, and when she finds Nikki going through her deceased mother's clothes, she expresses her concern to James, whom she believes Nikki has fallen in love with, which he dismisses. Upon overhearing that James's job could be in jeopardy, Nikki takes matters into her own hands by stabbing a hospital staff member, Conrad, to death, which saves James's position at the hospital.\nJames makes preparations for Nikki's upcoming birthday, and she sees to it that it will just be the two of them for the evening. Meanwhile, Troy finds Nikki and attempts to kidnap her, before she manages to kill him. Fawn decides to do some investigating on Nikki, beginning with a library ticket she found in one of her books, with the name Andrea McBride printed. She locates Andrea's address, while Mrs. McBride claims not to recognise \"Nikki\" from a photograph shown by Fawn. Fawn later makes entry to Mrs. McBride's home and discovers that Andrea and Nikki are one and the same.\nMrs. McBride goes to the Lewis household and confronts Nikki, revealing that she is aware that she killed Troy, and blackmails her into making continuous payments to her, otherwise she'll see that Nikki is sent back to the psychiatric hospital. Nikki stabs her to death and tries to go on with her evening as normal. When James rejects Nikki's advances, she attacks him and ties him up. Fawn returns home and Nikki attempts to kill her, before a fight erupts. James breaks free, just as Nikki tries to stab Fawn, and sympathetically reasons with her, before she gives up her weapon. Some time later, she is securely locked away in the psychiatric hospital, where she writes out wedding invitations, believing that she and James are getting married.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nTracy Nelson as Nikki Harcourt/Andrea McBride\nBruce Boxleitner as Dr. James Lewis\nDana Lewis as Fawn Lewis\nScott Terra as Ben Lewis\nSusan Blakely as Dr. Julia Bruning\nKatherine Helmond as Mrs. McBride\nDarren Gray Ward as Troy Hatfield\nCindy Guyer as Mandy\nAmy Stock-Potnton as Beth O'Reilly\nSara Van Horn as Nurse Thelma\nScott Alan Smith as Conrad\nDavid Sederholm as Handsome Man\nJoyce Fessides as Doris\nCharles O'Glenn as Dr. Tanner Wallace\nChristopher Kriesa as Librarian\nSherrie Rose as Rosalee\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Perfect Nanny had received a mixed critical reception. In a review for the website The Movie Scene, it was rated at 3 out of 5 stars, while it was pointed out that the film adheres to the usual cliches seen in a Lifetime movie, and that the film is \"simply a formula driven TV movie\". However, praise was given for it good casting, particularly Tracy Nelson and Bruce Boxleitner. It was stated that \"Tracy Nelson who does a nice job of bringing out her character's paranoia and unsettled nature which makes her dangerous whilst a little over the top. As such Nelson makes for an entertaining psycho which is what the movie really calls for.\" Finally, it was said that \"What this all boils down to is that \"The Perfect Nanny\" is just your routine delusionally obsessed young woman drama where she is capable of killing to try and get her way. It does mean that it is predictable yet thanks to Nelson as well as Boxleitner it is also entertaining.\"\nIn a review for science-fiction, horror and fantasy reviews website Moira, the film was rated at 3 stars, and again criticised for its predictable plot line and storytelling, and that \"The Perfect Nanny never quite scales the same heights that The Landlady did but is better than average among [Pierre] David’s psycho-thrillers.\" On a more positive note, Robert Malenfant was acknowledged for his direction: \"Rob Malenfant manages to conduct a reasonable degree of tension and some fair surprises,\" while the cast were praised for their performances.\n\n\n== Home media ==\nThe Perfect Nanny was released on DVD via York Entertainment on August 14, 2001.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Perfect Nanny at IMDb",

        "content": "The 2024 ToyotaCare 250 was the 6th stock car race of the 2024 NASCAR Xfinity Series, and the 44th iteration of the event. The race was held on Saturday, March 30, 2024, at Richmond Raceway in Richmond, Virginia, a 0.75 miles (1.21 km) permanent asphalt tri-oval shaped short track. The race took the scheduled 250 laps to complete. Chandler Smith, driving for Joe Gibbs Racing, would dominate the final stages of the race, leading 76 laps and earning his third career NASCAR Xfinity Series win, his second of the season, and his second consecutive win at Richmond. Smith's teammate, Aric Almirola, was the most consistent driver of the race, leading a race-high 95 laps and winning both stages. He ended up finishing 2nd in the race. To fill out the podium, Taylor Gray, driving for Joe Gibbs Racing, would finish 3rd in his series debut in a JGR 1-2-3 finish.\nThe race would feature a late race incident between Joey Gase and Dawson Cram. While battling outside the top 25 on lap 171, Cram and Gase had made contact at the end of the frontstretch, causing Gase to spin into the outside wall in turn 1. Frustrated, Gase reacted by ripping off his back bumper cover, and throwing it at Cram's car. NASCAR had fined Joey Gase $5,000 on a safety violation may be imposed for any action or omission by a competitor or vehicle that creates an unsafe environment or poses a threat to the safety of the Competitors. \n\n\n== Report ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nRichmond Raceway (RR) is a 0.75 miles (1.21 km), D-shaped, asphalt race track located just outside Richmond, Virginia in unincorporated Henrico County. It hosts the NASCAR Cup Series, NASCAR Xfinity Series and the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series. Known as \"America's premier short track\", it has formerly hosted events such as the International Race of Champions, Denny Hamlin Short Track Showdown, and the USAC sprint car series. Due to Richmond Raceway's unique \"D\" shape which allows drivers to reach high speeds, Richmond has long been known as a short track that races like a superspeedway. With its multiple racing grooves, and proclivity for contact Richmond is a favorite among NASCAR drivers and fans.\n\n\n==== Entry list ====\n(R) denotes rookie driver.\n(i) denotes driver who is ineligible for series driver points.\n\n\n== Practice ==\nThe first and only practice session was held on Saturday, March 30, at 8:35 AM EST, and would last for 20 minutes. Bubba Pollard, driving for JR Motorsports, would set the fastest time in the session, with a lap of 22.855, and a speed of 118.136 mph (190.121 km/h).\n\n\n== Qualifying ==\nQualifying was held on Saturday, March 30, at 9:05 AM EST. Since Richmond Raceway is a short track, the qualifying system used is a single-car, two-lap system with only one round. Drivers will be on track by themselves and will have two laps to post a qualifying time. Whoever sets the fastest time in that round will win the pole.\nParker Retzlaff, driving for Jordan Anderson Racing, would score his first career pole for the race, with a lap of 22.420, and a speed of 120.428 mph (193.810 km/h).\nNo drivers would fail to qualify.\n\n\n=== Qualifying results ===\n\n\n== Race results ==\nStage 1 Laps: 75\n\nStage 2 Laps: 75\n\nStage 3 Laps: 100\n\n\n== Standings after the race ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Rosamund Strode (18 May 1927 – 25 March 2010) was a British musician, editor, and administrator. She was Benjamin Britten's assistant and amanuensis from 1964 until his death in 1976, and keeper of manuscripts at the Britten-Pears Library in Aldeburgh until 1992.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nRosamund Strode was born in Amersham, Buckinghamshire on 18 May 1927, the daughter of Maurice Strode and Nancy Gotch (whose grandfather was the Victorian painter John Callcott Horsley). Her mother had been a pupil of Gustav Holst at St. Paul's Girls’ School.\nRosamund went to St Mary's school in Calne, Wiltshire, before studying viola and singing at the Royal College of Music. One of her teachers there was Ralph Vaughan Williams.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1948, Strode became an assistant to Imogen Holst, then teaching at Dartington Hall. It was there that she first met Benjamin Britten. Although she had planned to become a county music organiser, her time at Dartington re-inclined Strode towards singing. At Dartington, she sang in a concert with Peter Pears and Alfred Deller to mark the bicentenary of the death of Johann Sebastian Bach. In 1952, she joined the choir that Holst had founded in London, later known as the Purcell Singers. She also worked organising the London Boy Singers.\n\nStill assistant to Britten, Imogen Holst had moved to Aldeburgh, where Strode performed regularly. Strode assisted Holst through the 1950s, and moved to Aldeburgh in 1956. Her work increasingly involved duties for Britten, conducting research and helping with musical scores. Strode became a part-time assistant to the Aldeburgh Festival and in 1964, when Holst moved to focus on her own work, began working full time for Britten.\nAmong Strode's main roles were preparing fair copies of Britten's scores and editing his music for publication. One of her earliest tasks was cataloguing his childhood music. She also page-turned for Britten when he played piano, and worked in whatever capacity was required of her during the Aldeburgh Festival. Known for her attention to detail, exacting standards, and extensive knowledge of Britten's works, Strode remained his music assistant until Britten's death in 1976. Through her work during this period, The Times described Strode as having \"midwifed the music of his Indian summer\".\nIn 1966, Strode took on her own assistant, composer David Matthews. Matthews remained Strode's part-time assistant until 1969. In 1971, David Matthews' younger brother Colin, also a composer, was hired to assist Strode. This partly freed her to focus, from 1973, on the establishment of the Britten–Pears Library, whose policies and procedures she led the creation of. Colin Matthews later wrote Rosamund's Fanfare and Rosamund's Waltz, that were performed for Strode's 80th birthday on Britten's piano.\nFollowing Britten's death, Strode became keeper of manuscripts at the Britten-Pears library, and was the Britten-Pears Foundation's founding archivist. She retired in 1992.\nStrode wrote a number of essays on Britten's work, including an account of Britten's composition of Death in Venice for Donald Mitchell's book about the opera. She was joint author of Imogen Holst: A Life in Music (2007)–a landmark study of her close friend and mentor.\nStrode chaired the Holst Foundation for many years. In 2004, she unveiled an English Heritage Blue Plaque for Gustav Holst at St Paul's Girls' School in West London.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nRosamund Strode died aged 82 on 25 March 2010.\n\nIn an obituary for The Guardian, Colin Matthews wrote:Fiercely protective of Britten's privacy, she was self-effacing and modest about her own achievements, which were considerable... She inherited from Imogen Holst a mission to explain, and her legacy will continue to be found in the writings and memories of the many musicians and scholars who came to learn at her feet. Christopher M. Scheer has argued that \"understanding these individuals [Britten's amanuenses] and their place in the culture surrounding Britten illuminates how much they enabled his creative life,\" as well as \"the extent to which they shaped, and continue to influence, our understanding of his life and music\". The Sydney Morning Herald wrote that Strode \"did as much as anyone to keep [Britten's] star shining brightly at Aldeburgh\".\nA sketch of Strode by Milein Cosman is held at the Red House, Aldeburgh, where she worked.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Félix Martínez (born 9 July 2005) is a Belizean association footballer who currently plays for Premier League of Belize club Verdes FC and the Belize national team.\n\n\n== Club career ==\nAs a youth, Martínez played for Wagierale FC and was a regular scorer for the club. He played for Wagiya SC of the Premier League of Belize through the end of the opening round of the 2023–24 season. He had scored three goals in the first ten matches of the campaign.\nIn January 2024, prior to the start of the second half of the season, Martínez moved to league rivals Verdes FC. Soon thereafter, he scored the game-winning goal in a victory over Benque Viejo United FC in the Western Championship, a knock-out tournament to determine the top club in the Cayo District. It was Martínez's first goal for the club. Verdes FC went on to win the tournament. In the opening match of the second half of the season, and Martínez's first league match with Verdes, he scored in a 3–0 victory over Belmopan Bandits.\n\n\n== International career ==\nIn January 2024, Martínez represented Belize at the youth level in the 2024 UNCAF U-19 Tournament. He scored in a 2–1 victory over Cuba to close out the group stage. He scored again in the fifth-place match against Nicaragua with Belize ultimately finishing sixth with the 1–3 defeat. Later that year, he was called up for 2024 CONCACAF U-20 Championship qualifying. He scored one goal against the British Virgin Islands and a hat-trick against Anguilla during the ultimately unsuccessful qualifying campaign.\nMartínez received his first senior international call-up in March 2024 for a pair of friendlies against Puerto Rico at home. He made his senior international debut on 24 March 2024, in the second fixture. After entering the match as a substitute, he scored his first senior international goal in the eventual 3–0 victory.\n\n\n=== International goals ===\nScores and results list Belize's goal tally first.\n\n\n=== International career statistics ===\nAs of match played 24 March 2024.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFélix Martínez at National-Football-Teams.com\nFélix Martínez at Soccerway\nFélix Martínez at Global Sports Archive",

        "content": "Isabella Kirkland (born 1954) is an American visual artist and biodiversity researcher. She is known for intricate, representational paintings that straddle art history, natural science and ecological activism. Since the mid-1990s, she has documented biota in series focused on species that are extinct, disappearing, collected or illegally trafficked, or emerging from near-extinction. Her work fuses the classical naturalist tradition of wildlife painters like John James Audubon and the precise rendering style and time-tested oil techniques of 17th-century Dutch Master still life painters. Situated in the contemporary context of global warming, however, her paintings subtly upend such idealized traditions, invoking a sense of accountability in response to the specter of ecological flux and impermanence. New York Times critic Ken Johnson wrote that Kirkland \"produces richly atmospheric pictures collectively populated by hundreds of animals. … Updating the peaceable kingdom genre, she is trying to make beautiful paintings of the world at its most beautiful, not for the sake of art but for the sake of our endangered biosphere. She does not preach but communicates an infectious spirit of care.\"\nKirkland's work belongs to the collections of institutions including the Whitney Museum, Berkeley Art Museum and Saint Louis Art Museum (SLAM). She has exhibited at the National Academy of Sciences, Harvard Museum of Natural History, Field Museum of Natural History (Chicago) and SLAM, among other venues. She is a research associate in aquatic biology at the California Academy of Sciences and has spoken about ecological issues at conferences including several TED events.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nKirkland was born in 1954 in Old Lyme, Connecticut. She attended Guildford College in North Carolina and Virginia Commonwealth University, before studying sculpture at the San Francisco Art Institute in the late 1970s.\nKirkland lived in New York City through much of the 1980s, pursuing her art career while also becoming a licensed taxidermist and teaching herself botanical illustration, both of which presaged her turn to naturalistic painting in the 1990s. Her early art centered on environments hovering between painting and sculpture  and impermanent conceptual installations that used unusual materials (e.g., ice, trash) and examined contemporary social issues. She presented this work in solo exhibitions at Gallery Paule Anglim, New Langton Arts (both in San Francisco) and Real Art Ways (Hartford) and group shows at The Alternative Museum (New York), Hallwalls (Buffalo) and The Living Room (San Francisco), among other venues. New York Times critic Vivien Raynor wrote of the Real Art Ways exhibition, which addressed overpopulation, nuclear war and racism: \"Seemingly reluctant to bully her viewers, Kirkland errs on the side of tortuousness and sometimes, of playfulness, but her integrity is unmistakable.\"\nIn 2004, Kirkland suffered neural and motor control damage from parasitic infection after a tropical roundworm attacked part of her spinal cord. The incident and its effects—so rare that doctors were unaware of the symptoms or treatments—left her unable to draw for several months. She eventually recovered full control of her right hand, but was left with chronic neuropathic pain in the upper right quadrant of her body, most critically, dysesthesia (sometimes described as a burning sensation under the skin) in her hand and wrist; she has stated that the condition can abate during the flow-state induced by painting. In 2008, Kirkland received the Wynn Newhouse Award, which recognizes contributions of artists with disabilities to contemporary art.\nSince 2000, Kirkland has had solo exhibitions at Feature Inc. (New York), the National Academy of Sciences, Toledo Art Museum, Saint Louis Art Museum, Dayton Art Institute and Hosfelt Gallery (San Francisco), among others. She has shown in nature-related surveys at the Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art, Tucson Museum of Art and Whatcom Museum.\nKirkland lives in Sausalito, California with her husband, Chris Tellis, on a yellow ferryboat docked in the San Francisco Bay. \n\n\n== Naturalistic painting ==\n\nIn the 1990s, Kirkland's early artistic focus on impermanence shifted to a consideration of art's lasting power; the change was cemented by a museum exhibition of Dutch Master works, which convinced her to learn to paint in that style. Her initial foray was the \"Nature in the Margins\" series (1995–99), consisting of realistic paintings of individual, rare animals living in human environments that raised questions about wildlife survival amid overdevelopment. In 1999, a Sierra Club list of the 100 most-endangered animals in the U.S. crystallized parallel themes in her work—the durability of art and naturalist painting—into a single concept and her first mature series: the \"Taxa\" works, which catalogued various species groups.\nKirkland's naturalist paintings are characteristically large, lush works composed like well-balanced tapestries that both celebrate decorative beauty and address environmental degradation and homogenization. She meticulously depicts species that do not necessarily belong together, generally at scale. Her concentrated level of detail and complex compositions function to slow down the viewing process and encourage deeper connection—and potentially—a sense of responsibility. American Scientist writer Anna Lena Phillips noted, \"perhaps paradoxically, by removing species from their habitats, the paintings acquire the power to change our perception of the plants and animals within them. In this sense, Kirkland's work moves beyond the representation of scientific ideas to offer new ways of thinking about the organisms she depicts.\" Kirkland carefully researches the species in the paintings—which can take more than a year to execute—using original scientific descriptions, specimens, rubrics and databases often made available to viewers through keys or explanatory texts.\nWriters such as Renny Pritikin place Kirkland among a generation of artists reclaiming traditional realist painting and \"moving it toward extra-aesthetic ends\" and complex, contemporary concepts. She applies the accurate depiction of flora and fauna once used in scientific illustration to different means, regarding her intentionally durable oil paintings as a hedge against a possibly dystopian future—\"alarm clocks\" or analog \"time capsules\" of biodiversity that may outlast both the species depicted and the ephemerality of digital records. In this sense, like Dutch Master still lifes or history and political paintings (e.g., Guernica ), they serve the functions of bearing witness and carrying cultural or metaphorical content.\n\n\n=== Painting series, 1999–ongoing ===\n \nThe six large imaginary landscapes of Kirkland's \"Taxa\" suite (1999–2004) represent dynamic change in the natural world caused by human agency through depictions of nearly 400 life-size species. New York Times writer Andrew C. Revkin described them as \"a mix of Dutch Master and \"Where's Waldo?\" … full of hidden things worth looking for.\" Descendant (1999) portrayed 61 endangered or extinct species in the mainland U.S., Hawaii and Central America, while Ascendant (2000) depicted non-native species that are crowding out native residents in the U.S. In Trade (2001) and Collection (2002), vivid tableaux of depleted species that are highly valued (and thus harvested, poached and sold) underscored the human desire to possess exotic creatures. Back (2003) presented 48 species thought to be extinct but brought back into existence, using warm natural tones to convey the resilience of life; in contrast, the darker Gone (2004) catalogued 63 organisms that underwent full-species, worldwide extinction, many due to the colonization of the New World.\nThe four paintings of the \"Nova\" suite (2007–11; exhibited at Feature, Inc. in 2011) explored the complexity and interdependency of life through depictions of 250 newly discovered plant and animals. The profusely detailed, metaphoric ecosystems each represent a strata of a typical tropical rainforest: Forest Floor, Understory, Canopy and Emergent (the treetop level). Forest Floor (2007) included a stream with fish and salamander beneath its surface and multiple species of birds, insects and animals; Canopy (2008) featured spongy mats of moss, hornworts, liverworts and orchids, a beetle in flight and a heavy-jawed, yet-to-be-named mouse, among other species. The New York Times likened the work to \"lush, naturalist illustration with roots in the 19th-century transcendentalist realism of Martin Johnson Heade.\"\nIn later series, Kirkland turned to subjects including aquatic life (e.g., Squat Lobsters, 2021), gravestone lichens, butterflies and birds, phasmid (walking sticks and leaf insects) eggs, and flora. Her show \"Nudibranchia: Butterflies of the Sea\" (Bolinas Museum, 2014) explored those wildly colorful, soft-bodied marine gastropod mollusks in works that included a large canvas arraying 206 of the creatures life-size in rows from smallest (at top) to largest. \"The Small Matter\" (Hosfelt, 2021) was a near-retrospective scale show portraying a range of organisms, many invisible to the naked eye. It included depictions of specimens unnaturally bunched side-by-side, pinned or tagged, such as Bachman's Warblers Redux (2018) and the butterfly Pseudacraea boisduvali (2020), which suggested a wry meta-commentary on the human need to impose taxonomical order onto nature.\n\n\n== Writing and other professional activities ==\nKirkland has been a featured speaker at numerous biodiversity and ecological conferences and events, including TEDx DeExtinction (2013), The Long Now Foundation (2016) and the TED Countdown Summit 2023. She exhibited work at TED 2007. In addition to serving as a research associate in aquatic biology and scientific illustrator at the California Academy of Sciences, she is an artist partner of Art To Acres, an organization supporting large-scale global land and animal conservation through art and financial donations.\n\n\n== Collections and recognition ==\nKirkland's work belongs to the public art collections of the Bates College Museum of Art, Berkeley Art Museum, Chazen Museum of Art, Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center, Hammer Museum, Hood Museum of Art, Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Queens Museum, RISD Museum, Saint Louis Art Museum of Art, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Toledo Art Museum, Whitney Museum, Yale University Art Gallery, and Zimmerli Art Museum, among others.\nHer paintings have been reproduced as illustrations for several books and publications and as cover art for Whole Earth magazine and the books The Future of Life (2002) by E. O. Wilson, Extinction Studies: Stories of Time, Death, and Generations (2017, by Rose, van Dooren and Chrulew), and Animal Traffic: Lively Capital in the Global Exotic Pet Trade (2020) by Rosemary-Claire Collard.\nKirkland has been recognized with a Wynn Newhouse Award (2008) and grants from George Sugarman Foundation (2005) and Marin Arts Council (2004). \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIsabella Kirkland official website\n\"Isabella Kirkland: The Beauty of Wildlife,\" TED Talk, July 2023\n\"Painting the Endangered World | Isabella Kirkland\", talk at Long Now Foundation, 2017\n\"Isabella Kirkland: Material Longevity\", Berkeley Arts + Design, 2020\nIsabella Kirkland, Eclectix interview, 2013\nIsabella Kirkland, Hosfelt Gallery.\nIsabella Kirkland, Feature, Inc.",

        "content": "Designers & Dragons is a book by Shannon Appelcline about the history of the tabletop role-playing game industry.\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nShannon Appelcline wrote the book Designers & Dragons, published in 2011 by Mongoose Publishing.\nAppelcline wrote an expanded four-volume version of Designers & Dragons: A History of the Roleplaying Game Industry, published in 2014 by Evil Hat Productions, with one volume dedicated to each decade from the 1970s to the 2000s.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nRené Reinhold Schallegger wrote that for his 2018 book The Postmodern Joy of Role-Playing Games: Agency, Ritual and Meaning in the Medium, one of the central texts for the chapter \"Generations: The Origins and Development of RPGs\" was the original volume of Designers & Dragons, a \"comprehensive chronological collection of major RPG publishing houses and their games [...] Appelcline takes a production-oriented approach, chronicling the development of the people who make RPGs and their companies\" and that his \"detailed content should provide a satisfactory insight into the evolution of the medium in form and content beyond D&D.\"Troy Leaman in his 2016 book Playing for Change: FreeMarket and the Rise of Serious Tabletop Role-Playing Games noted how the two volumes on the 1990s and the 2000s \"discuss the legal battles and rulings that determined that system mechanics could not be copyrighted.\"The 2018 book Role-Playing Game Studies: Transmedia Foundations  posits that \"true to the intertwining of RPG fandom and scholarship, independent authors like Jon Peterson (2012) and Shannon Appelcline (2015) have produced substantial historiographies of the emergence and evolution of TRPGs and RPGs more generally [...] The historical arc traced here draws in large measure upon two recent histories of the origins of TRPGS: Jon Peterson's Playing at the World (Peterson, 2012) and Shannon Appelcline's multi-volume Designers and Dragons (Appelcline, 2013). Peterson describes the precursors to and influences upon the development of D&D as well as the early history of the game itself (Chapter 3), while Appelcline details the fortunes of the myriad TRPG publishers that emerged, decade by decade, in the wake of D&D's publication. These works provide detailed overviews of the history of RPG publishing, extending earlier, briefer accounts but, in large measure, confirming their outlines.\"Patrick Holleman in his 2019 book Reverse Design: Diablo II praised the work of Appelcline, noting of his own previous work Reverse Design: Final Fantasy VII, \"If you're looking for a longer explanation of RPG design history, I recommend that book and the many great books it cites, especially the work of Jon Peterson and Shannon Appelcline.\"Curtis D. Carbonell in his 2019 book Dread Trident: Tabletop Role-Playing Games and the Modern Fantastic wrote that \"the broad category of RPGs has been subjected to a considerable amount of critical commentary. ... Jon Peterson's Playing at the World (2012) and Shannon Appelcline's Designers and Dragons (2015) both offer expansive histories of TRPGs. What ties these works together is fantasy's seminal role in opening horizons of possibility for new technological-driven world creation and subject formation.\"Matthew B. Caffrey Jr. wrote in his 2019 book On Wargaming: How Wargames Have Shaped History and how They May Shape the Future that \"For the most comprehensive history of not only the birth of Dungeons & Dragons but the role-playing industry itself see Shannon Appelcline's four-title Designers & Dragons series on Kindle from Evil Hat Productions (expanding and updating a single-volume issuance from Mongoose Publishing). It is also a good history of print and miniatures wargame publishers.\"Matthew Ryan Williams for Wired wrote that \"Shannon Appelcline's four-book series Designers and Dragons presents an incredibly detailed look at the history of tabletop roleplaying games, featuring profiles of more than a hundred companies, including TSR, Wizards of the Coast, and White Wolf. ... For each article, Appelcline gathered as much information as he could from magazines and websites, then ran his research past people who had actually worked at the companies in question. ... Along the way he discovered that the history of tabletop gaming is full of confrontations, betrayals, and scandals, which makes Designers and Dragons a surprisingly lively read.\"Dimitra Nikolaidou wrote in the 2020 book War Games: Memory, Militarism and the Subject of Play how \"According to Shannon Appelcline's (2013) exhaustive historical treatise Designers and Dragons, the story of roleplaying games is the story of two different trends coming together: one concerning wargames, the other reflecting the new-found love for fantasy that flourished with the sudden US success of Lord of the Rings in the 1960s.\"Gerald Nachtwey wrote in his 2021 book Strictly Fantasy: The Cultural Roots of Tabletop Role-Playing Games how \"Two recent histories of the hobby that have found their way into print are notable: Jon Peterson's Playing at the World (2012), and the series Designers & Dragons by Shannon Appelcline (2013), which devotes one volume each to the 1970s, eighties, nineties, and two-thousands [...] Appelcline's series relies on Peterson's book at many points—especially in the early volumes—but expands on that prior work by focusing more intently on the business end of the early hobby, with special attention paid to things like intellectual property rights, marketing, and distribution. Both authors manage to present a mountain of information in a very accessible, engaging format, and anyone interested in particular stages of the development of the hobby—from hit points and character classes to the first “indie” games and the rise of \"story-based\" role-playing—will find a rich trove of resources in either work [...] Shannon Appelcline has already written an extensive account of the economic history of the hobby in his Designers & Dragons series, in which he highlights an important fact: however much role-playing games might constitute a labor of love, from their earliest conception they were mined for their profit-making potential.\"Ben Riggs in his 2022 book Slaying the Dragon: A Secret History of Dungeons & Dragons wrote that \"when I was assigned to write an article titled “Did You Know that Wizards of the Coast DIDN'T Originally Make Dungeons & Dragons?\" for Geek & Sundry, I felt like I knew the exact story I was going to tell about the company's fall. I'd lived through it and read Shannon Appelcline's excellent Designers & Dragons, which touched on the topic. [...] According to RGP historian Shannon Appelcline, \"Back in 1978, Gygax had decided that it was best if the players did not know the rules.\" [...] Thanks to Shannon Appelcline, for his ambitious and clear-cutting work in RPG history.\"Stu Horvath in his 2023 book Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground, Deluxe Edition: A Guide to Tabletop Roleplaying Games from D&D to Mothership wrote that \"A number of references were critical in the writing of this book. First among them is Shannon Appelcline's four-volume history, Designers & Dragons (Evil Hat Production, 2014). Those books were an invaluable resource for getting my facts straight and should be the first stop for anyone desiring to read about the history of the RPG hobby.\"Benjamin Joseph Munise in his 2023 PhD thesis \"Roleplaying Games and Performance\" that \"Shannon Appelcline's four-volume Designers & Dragons series, published by the TTRPG publisher Evil Hat Productions [...] combined archival documents and interviews to assemble portraits of significant game designers and the shape of the TTRPG industry over four decades, from the 1970s through the 2000s.\"Scott Michael Bruner in his 2023 PhD thesis \"Agential Fantasy: A Copenhagen Approach to the Tabletop Role-Playing Game\" wrote that \"Jon Peterson and Shannon Appelcline's historical scholarship provides the record of the emergence of the TRPG.\": 57  Bruner stated that compared to Jon Peterson's Playing at the World (2012), \"Appelcline's Designers & Dragons series (2014- 2015) is an equally valuable record of the history of TRPG companies, creators, and philosophies of design.\": 66  Bruner noted that Dave Arneson \"has not received as much popular recognition – although his influence is being discovered and reevaluated (thanks in part to the rigorous scholarship of historians such as Peterson and Appelcline).\": 88  Bruner commented that \"Appelcline notes that TRPG play in the 1970s was often “competitive” between players and the referee.\": 99  Bruner noted how \"In The Science Fiction in Traveller, Appelcline examines many of the most influential texts and genres which influenced the game’s design (2016). ... The literary inspirations that Appelcline and Driussi refer to are based in 20th Century pulp fiction. As with the lurid, fantastic action-oriented titles that inspired Gygax for Dungeons & Dragons, many of Traveller's literary antecedents are fairly obscure. Appelcline identifies Dickson’s “Childe Cycle” series, H. Beam Piper's space operas, Keith Laumer's comic science fictions, E.C. Tubb's “Dumarest” saga, and David Drake's military science fiction stories, as primary inspirations.\": 164–165  Bruner wrote that \"Although Miller has cited Asimov’s “Foundation” series as influential to Traveller, most of the works that Appelcline identifies belong to a more heroic, adventurous legacy of science fiction (which might also lend themselves more accessible to a game that requires players to role-play compelling action-oriented heroes) (Wolf). Appelcline posits that Traveller is a “child of the ‘50s and ‘60s,” because its inspirations belong to a mode of science fiction based on an interstellar manifest destiny. \": 166 \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttps://rpggeek.com/rpgseries/25621/designers-dragons",

        "content": "\"Cat Call\" (original name: \"Catswalk\") is an instrumental piece, composed by Paul McCartney, recorded by the British musical group Chris Barber's Jazz Band and released in 1967 as the A side of a single.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe instrumental \"Catswalk\" was written by Paul McCartney in 1959 and was part of the Beatles' live repertoire until 1962. The Beatles recorded a version in December 1962 at the Cavern Club in Liverpool, without an audience, using a Grundig tape recorder. At the time, they recorded several songs including \"I Saw Her Standing There\" and \"One After 909\" for EMI in order to show their repertoire of original compositions to Dick James, their music publisher. Apart from a few improvised measures on January 24, 1969, the 15th day of the Get Back/Let It Be sessions, the Beatles never recorded \"Catswalk\" in a studio. The Cavern Club version has not been officially released, but it can be found in bootlegs. McCartney wished that guitarist Bert Weedon could record it, but this did not happen.\n\n\n== Chris Barber ==\nBandleader and trombonist Chris Barber is the leader of a traditional jazz orchestra. With himself on bass and band members Lonnie Donegan (guitar and vocals) and Beryl Bryden (washboard), they recorded Leadbelly's \"Rock Island Line\", as a skiffle song. This recording became a big hit in 1955 in England and the United States and inspired John Lennon to start a band of his own, the Quarrymen (it was said that without Donegan and Barber, the Beatles probably would not have happened).\nPaul McCartney later met Barber and, in 1967, offered \"Catswalk\" for him to record. The band recorded it at London's Marquee Club in July, but McCartney felt the result could be better. A second recording session, with a new arrangement including a choir, took place on the 20th of the same month at Chappell Recording Studios at 52 Maddox Street in London, produced by Giorgio Gomelsky. The title of the song was changed to \"Cat Call\", with McCartney listed as sole composer, and is released as a single in the United Kingdom on October 20, 1967, with \"Mercy, Mercy, Mercy\" (credited to Joe Zawinul) on the B-side, but failed to chart. \nMcCartney and his girlfriend Jane Asher are present at the recording and it is said that the McCartney can be heard playing the organ and asking to \"Please play slower\" before the final section, which takes at this time a slower tempo, and heard among the choirs singing \"for he's a jolly good fellow\" during the finale. On the liner notes of the 1969 album Battersea Rain Dance, on which both sides of the single appear, it is instead stated that the organ is played by Brian Auger and that the voice is that of producer Gomelsky while McCartney is credited to a yell and as being part of the so-called cat callers.\n\"Cat Call\" was ultimately included on the 1979 compilation album The Songs Lennon and McCartney Gave Away.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Cat Call\" on beatlesbible.com\n\"Cat Call\" on The Paul McCartney Project",

The Braves, led by head coach Davey Whitney, played their home games at the Davey Whitney Complex and were members of the Southwestern Athletic Conference. They finished the season 27–0, 12–0 in SWAC, but did not receive a bid to the NCAA tournament because the SWAC was in a transition period and did not have an automatic qualifier. Instead, the Braves accepted a bid to play in the NIT where they lost in the second round to eventual NIT champion Indiana.\n\n\n== Roster ==\n\n\n== Schedule and results ==\n\n\n== References ==",

This was before the siege of Acre, so the al-Harafish stood against these negotiations, repeating with one voice, “We will not make peace with these cursed people,” which made al-Ashraf Khalil back down and decide to conquer Acre in the year 691 AH/1291 AD. Siraj al-Din Dhabyan was the commander of the al-Harafish and one of the leaders of the final attack that stormed the Crusader walls of Acre. Siraj al-Din Dhabyan led the al-Harafish, which consisted of the Sa'idi Egyptians and other tough commoners of Cairo. They attacked Acre despite the huge number of arrows that the Crusader soldiers were throwing at them, and he and his soldiers succeeded in the end in breaching one of the walls and raising the yellow flags on the towers of Acre.\nAfter Commander Siraj al-Din Dhabyan and his soldiers entered the palaces and churches of the princes of Acre, he amassed a great fortune that made him one of the richest people in Egypt. This wealth was estimated at 1,700 dinars and 22 thousand dirhams.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "New England Soldiers' Relief Association was an organization formed during the American Civil War with the purpose, \"To aid and care for all sick and wounded soldiers passing through the City of New York on their way to or from the War.\" It was established by Sons of New England resident in the City of New York, through the parents organization, New England Society of New York. The formal organization of the Association was completed April 3, 1862, and on April 8, the building No. 194 Broadway was opened to the reception of beneficiaries, serving as a home and a hospital. The Association closed on September 1, 1865.\n\n\n== History ==\nSoon after the outbreak of the civil war, the New England Society of New York became the nucleus of a wider and less formal organization-the Sons of New England. In April 1862, these men formed the New England Soldiers' Relief Association, whose object was declared to be \"to aid and care for all sick and wounded soldiers passing through the city of New York, on their way to or from the war.\" On April 8, its \"Home,\" a building well adapted to its purposes, was opened on Broadway, and Dr. Everett Herrick, was appointed its resident Surgeon. The Home was a hospital as well as a home, and in its second floor accommodated a very considerable number of patients.\n\nElizabeth Augusta Russell was appointed Matron. She was 26 years old at the time and remained as matron of the Association until the close of the war. The matron's salary was small and Russell was often at a loss for means to relieve the many cases which appealed to her and for which the government at that time had made no provision. The Association was the first provision made for the wounded soldiers, David's Island and Bedloe's Island being opened later. The wounded came by rail and by boat, from a dozen to 200 or more at a time. In the three years that she provided her service, she had under her care more than 60,000 soldiers, many of them wounded or disabled.\nFrank E. Howe was appointed Superintendent of the rooms and offices provided for the use of the Association by resolution of the Managers, passed April 3, 1862. The building No. 194 Broadway was selected for the use of the Association on account of its central location, its convenience to the routes of travel by which disabled soldiers arrived in the city, and for its easy and cheap adaptation to the wants of the Association.\nThe average number accommodated per month, during the first year of operation was 1,380. The average per day was 46. The largest number kept for a single night was 287. No limit was placed to the period for which soldiers were permitted to remain. Some were received through dangerous illnesses and tedious convalescence.\nUntil the month of August 1863, the Association received all the wounded soldiers it could accommodate. No distinction was made by Government between the Association and the various depots for sick and wounded men established in New York and its vicinity. In August, however, an order was made, forbidding all sick and disabled soldiers, not furloughed or discharged, from receiving other than Government care, and we were able to aid thereafter only such as had been actually discharged from service, or furloughed, or were on their way to rejoin their regiments.\n\n\n== Architecture and fittings ==\nThe Association occupied the second, third, fourth and fifth stories of the building, which was 25 by 175 feet (7.6 m × 53.3 m) in dimensions. It was  thoroughly ventilated and lighted. The ground floor and basement were occupied by the Superintendent for his private business; the entire building being rented for US$4,000 per annum, of which the Superintendent paid US$2,000. The first story was used as a reception and baggage room, and for the office of the Association. The reception room was used at night for a sleeping room, and in the office were the closets and store rooms for clothing and supplies of that description. The second story contained the \"sick ward.\" The first half was devoted to convalescents, and the rear half exclusively to cases of serious illness and to surgical cases. The apartment of the Resident Physician and Surgeon, and the medical storeroom were on this floor. The third story was a grand Dormitory. It contains 86 beds. The upper story contained the dining hall, the kitchen, pantries, laundry and wash room. Each floor was furnished with supplies of water, in bathrooms, water closets and wash stands. The laundry was fitted with the necessary conveniences for washing bed linen and soldiers' garments.\nAt the opening of these rooms, private sources provided many articles essential to the fitting of them. The United States, through the agency of Dr. R. I. Satterlee, Medical Purveyor, provided a large quantity of hospital bedding, beds, cups, and litters. The United States Sanitary Commission also provided supplies.\nFrom benevolent and soldiers' relief societies, and from town and church organizations and individuals in the Eastern States and in New York, a host of articles were received-among them second-hand clothing, shirts, stockings, drawers, undershirts, brandies, wines, fruits, pickles, jellies, lint, bandages, crutches, and slippers.\n\n\n== Administration ==\nThe Association was indebted to Colonel John H. Almy, Military Agent of the States of Connecticut and Rhode Island, for his time and business attainments. He and the Corresponding Secretary of the Association, Major William H. L. Barnes, assisted in the preparation of documents and reports relating to the Association. The administration of the Association was led by Dr. Everett Herrick, Resident Physician and Surgeon. The business department of the Association included the services of Major George Browne and the Messrs. Downing. Elizabeth Augusta Russell, Matron, had under her immediate charge all the \"housekeeping\" affairs.\nA Women's Auxiliary Committee was formed soon after the establishment of the Association, consisting of 30 women who took their turn of service as nurses for the sick and wounded through the year, and provided for them additional luxuries and delicacies to those furnished by the Association and the Government rations. These women were the wives and daughters of merchants, clergymen, physicians, and lawyers of the city. The women, in addition to their services as nurses, took part in a choir for the Sabbath services, in which all the exercises were by volunteers.\nThe care of the sick and wounded men during the night, devolved the Night Watchers' Association, a voluntary committee of young men, who during a period of three years, supplied the needful watch over the invalid soldiers.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNew York in the American Civil War\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Pre-Noachian is a geologic system and early time period on the planet Mars characterized by intense meteorite and asteroid impacts, volcanic and tectonic activity, and the potential existence of surface or subsurface water. This era represents a crucial phase in Mars' history, witnessing the planet's formation, and the shaping of its geological landscape. However, the Pre-Noachian period remains elusive, being the least understood among Mars' four geological phases. Erosion and deposition have obscured much of the evidence from this time period on Mars.\nThe Pre-Noachian period created lowlands on the northern hemisphere of Mars, potentially serving as reservoirs for ancient Martian water during later periods. These lowlands might have formed through lava erosion caused by extensive volcanic activity during this era, as the Pre-Noachian time period experienced the highest level of volcanic activity among all Martian epochs.\nDuring the Pre-Noachian period, Mars' atmosphere was denser than it is today, with higher concentrations of carbon dioxide stemming from volcanic, asteroid, comet, and meteorite outgases. This may have contributed to a possible greenhouse effect on Mars and the formation of silicates, iron oxide, sulfates, carbonates, clays, and hydrates, created from extensive heat. It is believed that as a result of meteorite outgassing, water vapor condensed into Mars' atmosphere. As the planet cooled, this water vapor precipitated onto the surface, forming oceans across Mars during subsequent time periods. Over time, the gases retained by Mars' gravity during the Pre-Noachian period have gradually outgassed from the planet's atmosphere. This occurs as the molecules become too heavy and dense to be contained in a cooler environment, leading to their release into space.\nDuring this time, Mars had a distinct magnetic field because its core was active. As magma cooled in the planet's lower layers, it formed metals necessary to make the magnetic field.\n\n\n== Description and name origin ==\nThe Pre-Noachian System and Period is named after Noachis Terra, a region of highlands west of the Hellas Planitia basin, and the pre comes from the word meaning before. (See Description and name origin on the Wikipedia page for the Noachian era on Mars for more information)\n\n\n== Pre-Noachian chronology and stratigraphy ==\n\nMartian time periods are based on geologic mapping of surface units from spacecraft images. A surface unit is a terrain with a distinct texture, color, albedo, spectral property, or set of landforms that distinguish it from other surface units and is large enough to be shown on a map. Mappers use a stratigraphic approach pioneered in the early 1960s for photogeologic studies of the Moon. Although based on surface characteristics, a surface unit is not the surface itself or group of landforms. It is an inferred geologic unit (e.g., formation) representing a sheetlike, wedgelike, or tabular body of rock that underlies the surface. A surface unit may be a crater ejecta deposit, lava flow, or any surface that can be represented in three dimensions as a discrete stratum bound above or below by adjacent units (illustrated right). Using principles such as superpositioning (illustrated left), cross-cutting relationships, and the relationship of impact crater density to age, geologists can place the units into a relative age sequence from oldest to youngest. Units of similar age are grouped globally into larger, time-stratigraphic (chronostratigraphic) units, called systems. For Mars, four systems are defined: the Pre-Noachian Noachian, Hesperian, and Amazonian. Geologic units lying below (older than) the Noachian are informally designated Pre-Noachian. The geologic time (geochronologic) equivalent of the Pre-Noachian System is the Pre-Noachian Period. Rock or surface units of the Pre-Noachian System were formed or deposited during the Pre-Noachian Period.\n\n\n=== System vs. Period ===\n\nSystem and Period are not interchangeable terms in formal stratigraphic nomenclature, although they are frequently confused in popular literature. A system is an idealized stratigraphic column based on the physical rock record of a type area (type section) correlated with rocks sections from many different locations planetwide. A system is bound above and below by strata with distinctly different characteristics (on Earth, usually index fossils) that indicate dramatic (often abrupt) changes in the dominant fauna or environmental conditions. (See Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary as example.)\nAt any location, rock sections in a given system are apt to contain gaps (unconformities) analogous to missing pages from a book. In some places, rocks from the system are absent entirely due to nondeposition or later erosion. For example, rocks of the Cretaceous System are absent throughout much of the eastern central interior of the United States. However, the time interval of the Cretaceous (Cretaceous Period) still occurred there. Thus, a geologic period represents the time interval over which the strata of a system were deposited, including any unknown amounts of time present in gaps. Periods are measured in years, determined by radioactive dating. On Mars, radiometric ages are not available except from Martian meteorites whose provenance and stratigraphic context are unknown. Instead, absolute ages on Mars are determined by impact crater density, which is heavily dependent upon models of crater formation over time. Accordingly, the beginning and end dates for Martian periods are uncertain, especially for the Hesperian/Amazonian boundary, which may be in error by a factor of 2 or 3.\n\n\n=== Boundaries and subdivisions ===\nThe lower boundary of the Pre-Noachian period on Mars is characterized by the emergence of significant geological activity and the initial shaping of the planet's surface during its early history. This boundary is defined by the presence of ancient cratered terrains, volcanic constructs, and impact ejecta deposits dating back to the earliest stages of Martian geological development. While the precise location of this boundary may vary depending on geological context and criteria used for its definition, it marks the beginning of Mars’ geological history as understood by scientists.\nIn the Pre-Noachian period, the eastern region of Mars featured ridged plains overlaying early to mid-Noachian aged cratered plateau materials. This period marked a significant phase in Mars’ geological history, preceding the Noachian era characterized by its own distinct geological features and processes.\nThe Pre-Noachian System is subdivided into two chronostratigraphic series: Lower Pre-Noachian and Upper Pre-Noachian. These series are delineated based on specific references or locations on Mars where surface units indicate distinctive geological episodes, identifiable by cratering age and stratigraphic position. For example, Hesperia Planum serves as the referent location for the Lower Pre-Noachian Series. The corresponding geologic time units for the two Pre-Noachian series are the Early Pre-Noachian and Late Pre-Noachian Epochs. It's important to note that an epoch is a subdivision of a period, and the terms are not synonymous in formal stratigraphy. The age of the Early Pre-Noachian/Late Pre-Noachian boundary remains uncertain, with estimates ranging from 4500 to 4100 million years ago based on crater counts.\nStratigraphic terms are often confusing to geologists and non-geologists alike. One way to sort through the difficulty is by the following example: You can easily go to Cincinnati, Ohio and visit a rock outcrop in the Upper Ordovician Series of the Ordovician System. You can even collect a fossil trilobite there. However, you cannot visit the Late Ordovician Epoch in the Ordovician Period and collect an actual trilobite.\nThe Earth-based scheme of formal stratigraphic nomenclature has been successfully applied to Mars for several decades now but has numerous flaws. The scheme will no doubt become refined or replaced as more and better data become available. (See mineralogical timeline below as example of alternative.) Obtaining radiometric ages on samples from identified surface units is clearly necessary for a more complete understanding of Martian history and chronology.\n\n\n== Mars during the Pre-Noachian Period ==\n\nDuring the Pre-Noachian period, Mars experienced significant geological and environmental dynamics. Intense volcanic activity sculpted the planet's surface through widespread eruptions, while impact cratering events left behind numerous craters across the Martian landscape. The atmosphere during this era was denser than in present times, likely containing higher concentrations of carbon dioxide and other gases, potentially contributing to a greenhouse effect. This atmospheric composition may have facilitated conditions conducive to the presence of liquid water on the surface, with evidence suggesting the existence of water bodies such as lakes, rivers, and possibly even oceans. Geological features such as valleys, channels, and basins formed during this period further support the notion of liquid water on ancient Mars. The Pre-Noachian period stands as a crucial era in Martian history, characterized by dynamic geological processes and the potential for liquid water, laying the groundwork for subsequent epochs of Martian evolution.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Kachin Independence Army's (KIA) offensive in Kachin State, known unofficially as Operation 0307 (after the date it began), is an ongoing military operation against the Tatmadaw military junta of Myanmar which began on 7 March 2024. Primarily centred along the road connecting Myitkyina to Bhamo, Operation 0307 was launched to capture junta bases which could threaten Laiza, the headquarters of the KIA. Operation 0307 was launched alongside concurrent KIA offensives against Hpakant and northern Shan State, and concurrent resistance offensives throughout Myanmar.\n\n\n== Previous Offensives ==\n\n\n=== Hpakant ===\n\n\n=== Northern Shan State ===\nAfter the Chinese-brokered ceasefire in Northern Shan State between the Three Brotherhood Alliance and the Tatmadaw, the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), alongside the Kachin People's Defense Force (KPDF) and the All Burma Students' Democratic Front (ABSDF), began an offensive into northern Shan State with the objective to capture Mongmit District. On 18 January, the allied forces began attacks on Mongmit, captured the Mongmit Police Station and 2 nearby villages. Junta forces responded with air and artillery barrages on the town, forcing allied resistance to put the town under siege. During the offensive on Mongmit, the KIA and allied forces also began launching attacks on neighboring Mabein on 19 January. On 21 January, after several days of fighting, allied resistance captured Mabein and most of the surrounding township. During fighting in Mansi Township on the same day, 17 junta soldiers were forced to cross the China-Myanmar border. On 25 March, allied resistance was forced to withdraw from Mongmit. On 26 March, the KIA captured Nam Hpat Kar village in Kutkai Township.\n\n\n==== Tensions with the TNLA ====\nThe KIA and the Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), members of the Northern Alliance and allies, began to experience tense relations in the beginning of February. On 4 February, it was reported that 50 KIA soldiers entered Kutkai, which has been under the control of the TNLA since January. The soldiers told a TNLA checkpoint that they would not stay the night, but they proceeded to deploy in the town centre to celebrate Kachin Revolution Day, setting up flags and telling households to send representatives to a military parade they were reportedly holding the next day without informing the TNLA. In response, the TNLA removed flags and reportedly threatened unarmed civilians. Due to rumours that the KIA was planning to advance on the town from positions in Nam Hpat Kar, residents of Kutkai were concerned that clashes between the 2 armies could erupt.\n\n\n== Operation 0307 ==\nOn 7 March, the KIA simultaneously launched attacks on over ten junta outposts in eastern Kachin. Fighting primarily took place along the highway between Bhamo and the Kachin State capital, Myitkyina, as well as around Laiza. The attacks are reportedly the beginning of a wider offensive in Kachin State, which some has called \"Operation 0307\" (after the day it began). Over 8 March, the KIA seized three major junta bases and several outposts, including Hpyun Pyen Bum, a junta's closest forward base to Laiza. The KIA and AA continued defending their headquarters and they allege that junta airstrikes had landed on the Chinese side of the border, east of Laiza. During the fighting, a Lisu junta-aligned Lisu National Development Party militia leader was killed in Aung Myay Thit village. \nOn 8 March, the KIA captured a junta camp north of Sumprabum and began attacking the town and its junta garrison post on 14 March. The attacks were likely part of a larger objective to block off northern Kachin for future offensives into Putao. \nBy 22 March, the KIA claimed to have captured over 50 military outposts and 13 strategically significant junta bases around the Myitkyina-Bhamo Road, including: all outposts surrounding Laiza, battalion headquarters in 5 townships, and camps near the KIA's old headquarters of Pajau. The Irrawaddy predicted on 23 March that the KIA might attack Bhamo, the headquarters of the 21st Military Operations Command, as the next target of their offensive. \nOn 28 March, KIA seized two junta bases in Yaw Yone and Nga Gayan near Lweje town on the Chinese border in Momauk Township. By 1 April, the KIA captured the entirety of the Bhamo-Lweje road.\n\n\n== See also ==\nOperation 1027\n\n\n== References ==",

In October 2008, bombs were left at Chaklader's residence at the Judges' Complex on Park Avenue in Kakrail. Barrister Rafique-ul Huq condemned the presence of a major at the Bangladesh Supreme Court deciding the cause list of the court violating policy at a discussion organized by the Bangladesh Supreme Court Bar Association protesting the discovery of bombs at Chaklader's residence. In October 2008, Chaklader and justice Imdadul Haq Azad were transferred from the bench dealing with criminal cases to one dealing with death penalty after granting bail to more than a 100 politicians detained by the caretaker government. \nIn February 2014, Chaklader and Justice AKM Shahidul Huq refused to hear a bank loan case of Jamuna Bank Limited after a Minister called seeking favor for one of the parities in the case. This led the Bangladesh Supreme Court Bar Association to call for the termination of said government Minister. on 25 May 2014, Chaklader abstained from work following a call of the Jatiyatabadi Ainjibi Forum, a pro-Bangladesh Nationalist Party lawyers association.\nChief Justice Surendra Kumar Sinha sought an explanation from Chaklader and Justice A. K. M. Shahidul Huq who made some observations on the eviction of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia in April 2015.\nChaklader retired in 2016.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Aime Simone (born 31 December 1993) is  a French singer-songwriter and producer. He was born in Paris to a French family with Norwegian origins. He rose to prominence in 2020 after his song “In This Dark Time” went viral in Ukraine. Later that year he released his first album, “Say Yes, Say No”, a DIY mixtape/album that was finished in 3 months. In 2021 his song “Shining Light” became a major hit in France, receiving platinum certification. In 2023 he released the album “Oh Glory” and was nominated as Male Revelation at Les Victoires.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHis maternal grandmother is originally from Norway. His paternal side originates in the Massive Central area of France, where he spent much of his summers as a child with his paternal grandparents, Aime and Simone, whom he is named after. He grew up in the 11th district of Paris where he had a complicated experience with school, where he often got into trouble which led to bigger issues such as panic attacks caused by trauma and later problems with the police. At the age of 11, he started learning guitar, and at 17 started writing his own songs, in English, for the reason that his heroes were all anglophone, and that the language allowed him freedom and intimacy that his native French did not. In his teenage years he developed a serious eating disorder which would plague him for the next decade, leading to many clinical stays and a nearly successful suicide attempt that had him pronounced dead for several minutes.\nIn 2012, he caught the attention of Pete Doherty at one of Pete's shows at the Bus Palladium in Paris when he threw a notebook of poems on stage which started a friendship between them. He spent much of the next year living with Doherty.\nIn 2013 he was discovered by Hedi Slimane who chose him as an exclusive model for Saint Laurent. He modelled in Paris and later in New York and Los Angeles for the brand. After living almost two years in Vienna, he met Sonja Fix in 2017, an American artist who became his main collaborator. That same year they moved to Berlin, which incited a new phase of personal and artistic experimentation. Later the next year their daughter was born. He released “In This Dark Time”, the second single released under the name Aime Simone, in early 2020.

On 12 March 2022, the Prosperity Party First Congress appointed him as Deputy Chairperson of the party, along with Demeke Mekonnen. Upon his selection Farah pledged \"I want to serve diligently and ethically; in order for me to be Ethiopian and serve you all with impartiality, and loyalty, for time and situations not to take to here and there, pray for me.”\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On November 13, 2023, the Arakan Army (AA), one of the dozens of ethnic resistance groups active in the civil war in Myanmar, launched a military offensive against Myanmar's military junta in Rakhine and southern Chin State. Fighting began concurrently with the launch of Operation 1027, which the Arakan Army, as a member of the Three Brotherhood Alliance, also participated in. The offensive broke an informal ceasefire between the Arakan Army and the junta that had been in place for a year. During the offensive, the Arakan Army would capture several towns in northern Rakhine including Mrauk U, the capital of Mrauk-U District and the historical capital of Arakan. They would then focus on attacking Sittwe, the state capital, and Ann, the headquarters of the junta's western command. International Institute for Strategic Studies reported AA’s sweeping gains \"are already enough to enable self-rule over a large portion of the Rakhine homeland and to reshape the wider balance of power in Myanmar.\"\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe Arakan Army and its civilian wing the United League of Arakan were founded in 2009 and quickly became one of Myanmar's strongest rebel groups. They gain territory in northern Rakhine and Paletwa Township by 2018 and fought wth the Tatmadaw military in late 2018 after the central government entered their territory. The fighting intensified until the Arakan Army announced a unilateral ceasefire in 2020 so that the 2020 general election could be held.\nAfter the resurgence of civil war in 2021, the Arakha Army focused more on expanding their administrative capabilities. However, over the 2022 monsoon season, the informal ceasefire reached in late 2020 between the Arakan Army (AA) and the junta broke down. With the military's attention diverted to the increasing resistance elsewhere and increasing popular support for an alliance with the NUG, the AA sought to expand its influence into southern Rakhine.\nOn 26 November 2022, the Arakan Army and the junta agreed to a temporary ceasefire brokered by Yōhei Sasakawa of the Nippon Foundation. Arakan Army spokespeople maintained that they agreed to the ceasefire for humanitarian reasons, as opposed to international pressure. The Arakan Army did not withdraw from fortifications held at the time of the ceasefire.\nAfter the beginning of Operation 1027, the displays of Tatmadaw incompetence and the rapid gains made by the Three Brotherhood Alliance inspired many previously disconnected resistance groups began to work towards unity to overthrow the Tatmadaw, which came into power after a coup in 2021. The Arakan Army, an ethnic armed organisation (EAO) made up of primarily Arakanese which fights for the self-determination of the Arakan, broke the 1-year ceasefire agreed to in 2022 on 13 November 2023 by attacking Border Guard Police in Rathedaung Township. \nAfter several months, the Arakan Army has made rapid gains throughout Rakhine and southern Chin State, capturing 8 out of 17 townships in Rakhine State, alongside 9 major towns throughout the state. Despite wide support for the offensive, ethnic Rohingya have been in conflict with the Arakan Army, with many accusing the Tatmadaw of attempting to stir ethnic conflict using several aligned EAO's and protests.\n\n\n== Timeline ==\n\n\n=== Operation 1027 begins ===\nOn the morning of 13 November 2023, the Arakan Army (AA) attacked two Border Guard Police stations in Rathedaung Township, breaking the Rakhine State Ceasefire Agreement between the junta and the Arakan Army. Dong Paik camp was captured by 6:30 am. On 14 November, the junta had already abandoned around 40 outposts in Rakhine state after attacks by the Arakan Army, but few came under their immediate control. Dozens of Myanmar security officers surrendered to the Arakan Army the following day.\nThe following night, the Arakan Army launched an attack on Pauktaw, seizing the township police station. By the next morning, the Arakan Army had taken control of the town. The junta sent two helicopter gunships alongside naval support to fire back, including at civilian housing, with heavy machine gun fire. Pauktaw's proximity to the Rakhine state capital, Sittwe, posed a threat to the junta. Junta forces detained about 100 residents who were unable to flee, and positioned themselves to surround the town, using two navy ships to blockade the harbour.\nOn 14 November, the Arakan Army launched an offensive in Paletwa Township on the Chin-Rakhine border. The Arakan Army accused the Tatmadaw of using chemical weapons during the ensuing battles. On 6 December, the Arakan Army announced that they had captured a major military base in the township.\nOn 8 January 2024, the Arakan Army continued Operation 1027 and captured the Taung Shey Taung base and its 200 junta soldiers in Kyauktaw Township, Rakhine State. They then escalated their offensive into Paletwa Township, Chin State with the aim of capturing Paletwa, a strategic town for the Indo-Myanmar Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project On 15 January, the Arakan Army seized Paletwa and the entire township, declaring it a \"military council-free area.\" A week later, the Arakan Army captured the town of Pauktaw in Rakhine State concluding a three-month battle.\nOn 17 January 2024, the Taingen camp on the Falam road to the Indian border was captured, with Chin resistance forces seizing arms and ammunition. On 20 January 2024, after more than 600 junta soldiers and refugees crossed the India–Myanmar border, the Government of India announced a plan to fence the entire border.\n\n\n=== Spillover into Bangladesh ===\n\nOn 3 February 2024, as the clashes between the Arakan Army and Tatmadaw increased in Rakhine, mortar shells and several bullets reportedly landed in Bangladesh territory, which injured some local residents. Repeated bursts of gunfire and explosions were be heard across the Bangladesh–Myanmar border from Ukhia, Cox's Bazar. At least 229 Myanmar Border Guard Police (BGP) personnel entered Bangladesh through the Tumbru border point seeking refuge from AA, where the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) disarmed them and gave them shelter in Bandarban district. On 5 February 2024, a Bangladeshi woman and a Rohingya man died from a mortar shell that fell on the Ghumdum border in Bandarban, reportedly fired by Myanmar.\n\n\n=== Fall of Mrauk U ===\n\nThe Arakan Army captured most remaining Tatmadaw bases in Minbya by 6 February, almost taking full control of the township. On the same day, the Arakan Army seized the Taung Pyo junta outpost along the border with Bangladesh in Maungdaw Township. The Arakan Army captured Kyauktaw the next day and continued fighting in Mrauk U and Ramree. The Tatmadaw abandoned Myebon to reinforce Kyaukphyu on 9 February, leaving ammunition behind in their rush and abandoning the southern township of Mrauk-U District. The following day, AA took the town of Mrauk U completing their control over the township. During the battle, three Myanmar Navy landing craft were reportedly sunk. In response to the seizure of the three towns, the junta blew up bridges in Kyauktaw Township and the state capital, Sittwe.\nOn 15 February, the Arakan Army captured Myebon and started intensifying their assaults on Ramree. These assaults killed around 80 junta reinforcements between 24 and 26 February. On 28 February, the Arakan Army captured the final junta outpost in Minbya Township, taking full control of the township.\n\n\n=== Sittwe offensive ===\nOn 5 March, the Arakan Army reportedly captured the town of Ponnagyun and its surrounding township. During the battle, junta warships and fighter jets shelled the town, eventually destroying the Zay Ti Pyin bridge connecting Ponnagyun to Rathedaung. The Arakan Army stated that it continued assaults on Rathedaung and Buthidaung Townships. The capture of Ponnagyun is significant as it is only 33 kilometres northeast of the regional capital, Sittwe, and allows the Arakan Army to threaten the city.\nOn 12 March, after an 85-day battle, the Arakan Army captured the town of Ramree. In Maungdaw Township, AA also captured a border outpost forcing 179 junta soldiers to flee into neighboring Bangladesh. On 17 March, the Arakan Army captured the town of Rathedaung, cutting off Sittwe from northern Rakhine State.\n\n\n=== Ann offensive ===\nOn 24 March, the Arakan Army began an offensive on Ann Township, launching attacks on Ann, the headquarters of the junta's Western Command. Ann's location is strategically important as the link between Rakhine and Magway Region via the Minbu-Ann road through the Arakan Mountains and as a gateway preventing AA from attacking southern Rakhine State. On 27 March, AA forces seized the camp near Ge Laung and Lone Kauk villages of Ann township, where the junta’s Western Regional Military Headquarters is located. \nOn 2 April, they began attacking regime forces in Ngape Township, Magway on the other side of the Arakan Mountains. The Arakan Army announced it had captured a portion of the Ann-Minbu Highway, cutting off Ann from neighboring Padein.\n\n\n== Rohingya combatants ==\nBetween 4 February and 6 February, the Arakan Army launched attacks on Rakhine Border Guard Police (BGP) outposts in Maungdaw Township. The Arakan Army later alleged that the Rohingya ethnic armed organisations (EAOs) Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army and Rohingya Solidarity Organisation fought alongside the Rakhine BGP, allegations they gave no evidence towards. On 6 February the Arakan Army and the RSO cooperated on a joint assault against the Arakan Rohingya Army, who had captured a BGP camp along the Bangladesh-Myanmar border. 2 days later, the RSO denounced AA's accusations and the AA labeling them as \"Bengalis\" among other issues. Some time in March, a Rohingya man was shot in Sittwe. After the Arakan Army was blamed, it was found that the shooting was committed by the Arakan Liberation Army, working as a proxy of the junta to stir ethnic tensions.\nIn late February, despite the conscription law only applying to citizens, the military junta reportedly began to conscript displaced Rohingyas living in Kyaukphyu. On 6 March, in response to this junta recruitment, the AA urged Rohingya people to flee into AA-controlled areas despite the tense relations between the AA and Rohingya EAOs. In Buthidaung, ARSA was allegedly training Rohingya people for the junta. Nay San Lwin, co-founder of the Free Rohingya Coalition, stated that at least 1,000 people from the Rohingya community being taken by the military from Buthidaung, Sittwe and Kyaukphyu, and dozens have been killed while being used as human shields in Rathedaung Township.\nOn April 15th, the Arakha Army clashed with the ARSA in Buthidaung, resulting in 25 Rohingya deaths and 3,000 fleeing. ARSA and ARA reportedly fought with the Tatmadaw, where they burnt down homes and kidnapped civilians.\n\n\n== Civilian attacks ==\n\nJunta shelling of a crowded market in Sittwe killed 12 people and critically injured 18 on 27 February. According to RFA’s figures, 73 civilians were killed and 103 were injured between March 1 and March 18 for the junta sent airstrikes and artillery fire into communities captured by the rebel ethnic Arakan Army. In Myay Pon, junta airstrikes destroyed homes and schools; while in Mrauk-U, aerial drone attacks on March 15 and March 17 in ethnic Rakhine neighborhoods left three dead and eight injured. The UN chief António Guterres expressed \"alarm\" about the air attacks and called for calm.\nThe military accused AA of firing into Sittwe's Kathe neighborhood on 9 March, killing seven civilians. AA reportedly slaughtered military families attempting to flee Kyauktaw in Rakhine.\n\n\n== Information warfare ==\nA social media post in March 2024 showed the Rohingya protesting against the AA. Aung Kyaw Moe, a cabinet member of NUG, wrote in an X post that junta \"is using the Rohingya as a proxy to protest against AA in Buthidang is not definitely organic.\"\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Graduation\" (Ukrainian: «#Школа. Випускний», «HashtagShkola. Vypusknyi»).\n\n\n=== Format ===\nThe TV series initially was supposed to be a scripted reality for day slot. However, there occurred troubles regarding permission from parents to reproduce the stories and the need to redub dialogues in Ukrainian in post-production.

One of the «leftovers» from the scripted reality was the actors were wearing their own clothes instead of studio suits in the first season.\n\n\n=== Idea ===\nAccording to the creative producer Kseniia Chorna, the script was based on the real stories of Ukrainian alumni, told by their parents.\nThe series deals with issues relevant to Ukrainian education: bullying of schoolchildren, “Blue Whale Challenge”, drug addiction, bullying of teachers, relationships between children and parents in dysfunctional families, pedophilia, early pregnancy, sexual scandals regarding schools, etc.\n\n\n=== Location and chronology ===\nThe city where the school is located and the main events take place is not named, but from the dialogues you can understand that it is not Kyiv, since the main characters mention it as a point which is about two-three hours to go to.\nChronologically, the events of the series started in 2017.\n\n\n=== Shooting ===\nShooting of the first season was run in one of the Ukrainian schools from July to September 2017. The process proceeded quickly, since the deadlines were strict. Overall thirty episodes were shot for the first season.\nIn February the producer of the series announced the TV series was renewed for a second season. The premiere was planned on August 27, 2018. On June 12, 2018, the shooting of the second season started in one of the Kyiv schools.\nAny details concerning the filming of the third season as locations or the precise data of starting the shooting '1+1' didn't disclose.\n\n\n=== Musik ===\nThe soundtrack of the series was a song by Ukrainian band “Antytila” — «Where we are» (Ukrainian: «Там, де ми є», «Tam, de my ye») (TDME). It was presented on December 26, 2017, on 'Breakfast with 1+1'. The series’ soundtrack is also a ringtone of one of the main characters (Andrii), which can be noticed in the 7th episode of the first season. Besides, a song «Between the Worlds» (Ukrainian: «Між Світами», «Mizh Svitamy») by another Ukrainian band «Cloudless» was included in the soundtrack of the series. Also, a son by Ukrainian band «Violet» (Ukrainian: «Фіолет», «Fiolet») — «Silence» (Ukrainian: «Тиша», «Tysha»)\n\n\n=== Ads ===\nSince the second season there's advertising, in particular in the second season there are such brands as ASKfm mobile apps and Viber, Lamel cosmetics, Flint snacks, Eldorado electronics store, KITE backpacks, «Fanta» drinks, etc.\n\n\n=== Release ===\n\n\n=== Broadcasting with the Ukrainian-language original ===\nThe first season was broadcast on “1+1” channel from January 15, 2018 to February 15, 2018. The second season, namely «The School. Non-children games» was broadcast on «1+1» channel from August 27, 2018, to Oktober 11, 2018. TV premiere of the third season, namely «The School. Graduation», started on March 4, 2019, and ended on March 14, 2019.\nFrom March 1, 2019, viewers were able to purchase early access to the third season in the '1+1 video' mobile app, which gave an opportunity to watch episodes a day earlier than on TV.\n\n\n== Ranking ==\nThe first season became the highest-rated TV series on Ukrainian TV in the autumn 2017 — winter 2018 TV season among viewers aged 18–54. On average, one episode of the series was watched by approximately 2 million viewers, and in just the first two days of the TV broadcasting 10 million people watched the series.\nIn 2018, the first episode of the first season also was the most viewed video on YouTube in Ukraine among non-musical videos\n\n\n== Other media ==\n\n\n=== Book based on the series ===\nOn September 15, 2018, the presentation of the prequel book 'Lola's Diary' to the TV series by #knygolav publisher and writer Olga Kupriian took place.

        "content": "Violeta Giménez Niñoles (born 12 September 1978) is a retired Spanish rhythmic and acrobatic gymnast. In rhythmic gymnastics she's a three times World medalist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nShe started rhythmic gymnastics at the age of 5 in the municipal sports schools of San Juan de Alicante. At the age of 7 she moved to the CEU Jesús María Club and, in 1993, to the Club Atlético Montemar. In 1992 she was sixth in the Spanish Group Championships in the junior category with the 6 hoops exercise. In 1993, already at Montemar, she was fifth in the individual junior category in the Spanish Individual \"B\" Championships, and in December of that year she won All-Around silver and two gold medals in the apparatus finals in the 1st category of the Spanish Group Championships. The group was made up of Violeta, Marta Baldó, Noelia Fernández (captain), Estela Giménez, Peligros Piñero, Jéssica Salido and Montserrat Soria, some of whom will become members of the national team.\nIn 1994 she was chosen by coach Emilia Boneva along with her friend Estela Giménez to enter the Spanish national team as part of the senior group, in which she remained all year. During this time she lived with the rest of the team members in a house in Canillejas and trained at the Moscardó Gym for an average of 8 hours a day under the orders of Boneva herself and María Fernández Ostolaza.\nFor 1994, the two exercises of the ensemble were the 6 ropes one, where the music used by the group was the soundtrack of The Addams Family composed by Marc Shaiman, and the 4 hoop and 4 clubs, where they used the theme \"Spanish Fury\". In October 1994, although as a substitute gymnast in both exercises, she participated for the first time in an international competition: the World Championships in Paris, achieving the silver medal in the All-Around and two bronze medals in the apparatus finals. On the first two days of competition, the Spanish group obtained a total score of 38.700, about 225 thousandths less than the Russians, after having achieved a score of 19.350 in each of the two exercises. In the two apparatus finals on the last day, Spain achieved two third places, being surpassed by Russia and Bulgaria. In the 6 ropes final they scored 19.400 and in the 4 hoops and 4 clubs final 19.325. The group was made up of Marta Baldó, Lorena Barbadillo, Paula Cabo, Estela Giménez, Regina Guati and Amaia Uriondo, with María Pardo and Violeta as the substitutes. Furthermore, although they were not called up that year, Maider Esparza and Lucía Fernández Haro were in the team. At the end of the season, most of them retired.\nAfter leaving the national team, Violeta temporarily retired after becoming Spanish champion in December 1994 in Gijón with the first category team of Club Atlético Montemar made up of Violeta, Noelia Fernández, Verónica Lillo, Jéssica Salido, Patricia Simón and Marina Zaragoza. In 1995 she returned to training and in December 1996 she competed for the last time, becoming Spanish champion with the Montemar senior team.\nShe retired from rhythmic gymnastics permanently in December 1996. She later began practicing acrobatic gymnastics, a discipline she learned about while studying a degree in physical education in Valencia. In 2004 and 2005 she was Spanish champion in mixed pairs, and she competed in some international friendly interclub tournaments. She also created, together with several people, the free time association \"Vivevaleke\", where she began to hold shows, parades and workshops. In 2006 she was the founder of the Dinamic Acrobatic Gymnastics Club of Mislata, although since September 2010 they have been based in Manises. Since its foundation, she has been the director of the club, and is also the coordinator of the competition coaching team. The club has obtained good results and numerous victories in national championships, with some of its gymnasts participating in European and World Championships, and achieving bronze in the men's pair in a World Cup. Furthermore, Dinamic is also dedicated to producing shows and events of various kinds, some of which include Violeta as a member. In January 2012, Dinamic won the fourteenth edition of the Telecinco program Tú si que vales with a group acrobatic show in which she herself participated. As a result of this achievement, the club received a prize of 30,000 euros and a contract to work on The Hole show in Madrid during February of that year. Since 2014, as part of the Cirque des Sens company, Dinamic has developed the Aihua show, touring throughout Spain with it.\nFor 2016, Violeta was also a member of the Acrobatic Gymnastics Technical Commission of the Royal Spanish Gymnastics Federation.\n\n\n== References ==",

They didn't have a great start to the season, winning just 1 of their first 8 games, and after a bad run of form mid-season, Paul Hart was sacked with the club in 17th and Andy Ritchie was brought in for the rest of the season to steer the club away from any relegation fears. Michael Chopra was the club's main source of goals, netting 17 across the league campaign, with Michael Boulding also chipping in with 10. The cup competitions were also disappointing, as they were knocked out in the first round of the FA Cup by League Two side Northampton Town, thrashed 7-0 by Premier League Manchester City in the second round of the League Cup and thumped 5-0 by fellow League One side Port Vale in the EFL Trophy.\n\n\n== First team squad ==\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n=== League One ===",

        "content": "The Lesya Ukrainka Museum, also known as the Museum of Pre-Revolutionary Progressive Russian and Ukrainian Culture, Memorial Museum of Lesya Ukrainka (Yalta) exhibition “Yalta. Century XIX\", is a museum in Yalta, Crimea. It is dedicated to Ukrainian poetess and cultural figure Lesya Ukrainka, who once lived in the building and spent two years of her life in Yalta. In 1977, it was first set up as a branch of the Yalta Museum of Local Lore in the USSR. In Ukraine, since 1993, the museum has the status of a separate, independent cultural institution. In 2014 it was assigned as a department of the Yalta Historical and Literary Museum.\n\n\n== Historical background ==\nUkrainka first came to Yalta in 1897, staying in the Lishchinskaya mansion, designed by Yalta architect Platon Terebenyev in 1884-1885. She cherished the inexpensive and conveniently located accommodation near the sea. Initially, she was living on the first floor, then later on the second floor. In letters, the writer described her temporary residence as follows:\n\n“Today I wrote to dad about my new home: right here, only on the second floor. In winter, people au rez-de-chaussée do not live here, and they are right, because here the gardens are green all winter and therefore there is always shade on the lower floors, while very good during summer, it dissipates humidity in winter. With the help of a little \"military strategy\" on my part, my mistress gave me this house for 15 rubles, even though I myself see that, according to local customs, it is worth 20 rubles. It has two windows, one to the east, the second to the west, with double but not sealed frames (if anyone wants, they can pack it here too, but, in my opinion, this is unnecessary), a bed with springs, a couch, a large armchair (and not torn at that!), two tables, a wardrobe, a chest of drawers, a washbasin, \"the same as at the station\", and a screen. The door opens to a large paned veranda, half of which belongs to me, and half to my neighbor, a lady from Revel with two children, Larisa (15 years old) and Vitya (10 years old).”\nShe later visited Crimea again - i.e. Yalta, Alushta, and Sevastopol - in early 1907. In August of that year, she moved to Yalta with her husband, Kliment Kvitka, and stayed there for almost two years. In a newspaper insertion the poetess advertised herself as \"Chtytsa, knowing six languages, looking for a job in the city.\" She found at least two students who came to her Yalta home to take lessons. The relationship with the student Leoni Razumov and her family was particularly warm. \nUkrainka took care of replenishing the city's reading room with Ukrainian books, for example, she asked her mother to send Taras Shevchenko's Kobzar to Stakhanov's librarian, \"because people are asking for it a lot.\" During her stay in Crimea, she created a number of poems and other literary works, e.g. the dramatic poem \"Aisha and Mohammed\", the poem \"Cassandra\", and the dramatic poem \"On the Ruins\".\n\n\n== Founding ==\nAn initiative group to create a museum for the poetess in Yalta was formed in the early 1970s on the eve of the centenary of the birth of Ukrainka. In particular, it included one of her students, a researcher in the field of winemaking by the name of Mykola S. Okhrimenko. He was joined by Oleksii Nyrko, Oleksandr Yanush, Ostap Kindrachuk, Tsymbal Tetyana Ivanivna and other Yalta intellectuals, local historians and artists. A concurrent group of activists hailed from Kyiv, led by Yevhen Proniuk.\nAs a result of their efforts, a monument to the poetess was erected in the city, sculpted by Galina Kalchenko with Anatoly Ignashchenko as the architect, a memorial plaque was installed on the building where she lived in 1897, and the collection of associated exhibits was initiated. On December 23, 1977, a branch of the Yalta Museum of Local Lore was opened in the building with the exhibition \"Museum of Pre-Revolutionary Progressive Russian and Ukrainian Culture.\"\nHowever, generally speaking, the work on creating the Lesya Ukrainka Museum was not completed by then. Due to the persecution of the national intelligentsia in the 1970s up until the late 1980s, work on the museum was temporarily stopped. The house was completely restored in 1990.\n\n\n== Memorial Museum of Lesya Ukrainka (1993—2014) ==\nIn 1991, the exhibition \"Lesya Ukrainka and Crimea\" was opened in the museum to mark the 120th anniversary of the poetess' birth. On September 10, 1993, at the request of the Ukrainian public organization Prosvita (\"Enlightenment\"), a Yalta branch of the Union of Ukrainian Women, and after persistent public pressure overcame the long-standing resistance of officials, the Yalta City Executive Committee conferred the existing exhibition the status of a museum - as a branch of the Yalta State Historical and Literary Museum - it was henceforth known as the Museum of Lesya Ukrainka.\nOn the basis of the Lesya Ukrainka Museum in Yalta, the city's first school teaching in Ukrainian was founded. The museum premises serve as additional classrooms for students of the Crimean State Humanitarian Institute. The national amateur theater \"Seven Muses\" was created in the museum, and a large library on the history and development of Ukrainian culture was cumulated.\nFor the 10-year anniversary of the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine, thanks to continued accumulation of the museum's collection, the exhibition \"Firestones\" was opened with the help of the International Renaissance Foundation. Its main theme was the multifaceted creative personality of Lesya Ukrainka. In a lobby and three diverse exhibition rooms, it presented to visitors the historical and cultural context of Lesya Ukrainka's time in Crimea. It included the living room, typical of a 19th century Yalta resort; Ukrainian magazines in which, in addition to the work of Lesya Ukrainka, other Ukrainian writers of the 19th and early 20th centuries were discussed, whose fate was somehow connected to Crimea; and the \"antique\" hall, which recreated the spirit of ancient Tauris, which Lesya Ukrainka felt so vividly and wove into her texts, which she worked on in Crimea. The exhibition was on display until the 2014 annexation of Crimea.\n\nUntil 2014, the director of the museum was Olesya Visich, the scientific curator was Svetlana Kocherga.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Modern exhibition “Yalta. XIX century\" ==\nAfter the occupation of Crimea by Russia and the completion of renovations in the building, it became a department of the Yalta Historical and Literary Museum. The exhibition is called “Yalta. 19th century.\" Four halls tell about the literary, musical, artistic and philistine life of Yalta. The interior of a typical Yalta mansion of the 19th century has been recreated. Authentic furniture, household items, books, paintings, and historical photos create the atmosphere of Yalta in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. On display are F. I. Shaliapin's chairs, a piano from J. Pfeiffer's music store, a gramophone from the American Phonoton Co., a table at which L. N. Tolstoy sat, sheet music with autographs of singers and composers, personal belongings - introducing the musicians and writers whose life and work are connected with Yalta. Particular attention is paid to the Ukrainian writer and playwright Lesya Ukrainka, who rented rooms from Lishchinskaya in 1897.\nThe architecture of the city, houses, streets and estates are represented by the work of the architect Nikolai Petrovich Krasnov. More than 300 exhibits are presented - rare photographs, documents, drawings.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Red Hook Star-Revue is a local newspaper servicing Red Hook, Carroll Gardens, and the Columbia Waterfront neighborhoods of Brooklyn. The Red Hook Star-Revue publishes monthly editions and was established by George Fiala.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Red Hook Star-Revue was founded in June 2010 by George Fiala. Fiala, a graduate of Franklin & Marshall College class of 1954, initially sought employment as a radio journalist, however, with the decline of radio as a medium for television, Fiala instead signed on as the general manager of The Villager, and it's sister Brooklyn newspaper The Phoenix. In 1988 he left the world of journalism to establish a mailing service, saving up money until he could establish his own newspaper in 2010. Fiala established the newspaper in Red Hook, stating that the neighborhood was full of interesting stories, yet had no local newspaper, and sought to fill this niche. Fiala decided to name the newspaper the Star-Revue since he operated out of the Star Theater building, and as a homage to his original radio news employer, WRHY, a Starview-based station, with Starview being a neighborhood of York, Pennsylvania. \nThe Red Hook Star-Revue is distributed for free, mostly in restaurants, bars, and supermarkets, operating with revenue from ads in the paper. The Red Hook Star-Revue is a member of the New York State Press Association, and won the IPPIE award from the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York in 2023 and 2022.\nDespite the ads, the Red Hook Star-Revue still does not make a profit, and Fiala has to largely subsidize the newspaper from revenue from his mail service. Additionally, the paper opened at the same time as a massive downsizing of local news, with more than 100 local newspapers shutting down from 2009 to 2010. Fiala, and the Red Hook Star-Revue, focus their efforts on attracting millennials. The newspaper only has one full time journalist, Brett Yates, and has an overall Democratic leaning, albeit \"subversive\" with Yates and the newspaper publishing an op-ed against Andrew Cuomo advancing his political career.\nThe Red Hook Star-Revue would be sued by one Helayne Seidman, claiming copyright infingement on July 1, 2021, but by August 17 Seidman voluntarily dismissed the case.\nThe Red Hook Star-Revue would gain notability in local media publishing stories following the dumping of pollutants into the Buttermilk Channel by cruise ships, as well as the local discontent with cruise ships and their passengers, resulting in overcrowding of the neighborhood and a drop in revenue. Additionally, their report on American Stevedoring being removed from the Red Hook Container Terminal was also circulated in local media. As well as their report on gas outages at the Red Hook Houses.\nThe Red Hook Star-Revue also runs local political debates, namely for the 38th district of the New York City Council.\nIn 2023 the newspaper opened a sister publication, the Amagansett Star-Revue, operating out of Amagansett, New York, after Fiala inherited a summer home there.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Camus are a traditional folk band from Cambridge, England, named after a village in Co. Galway, Ireland. They perform as a fourpiece: Greg Smith on fiddle, Andrew Burn on melodeon, vocals and Northumbrian smallpipes, David Somerville on keyboards and Northumbrian smallpipes, and Brian Cleary on vocals, guitar and bouzouki. Their repertoire fuses influences from  Northumbrian, Shetland and Irish music, as well as their own song and tune compositions drawing on Cleary and Burn’s backgrounds in Ireland and North East England respectively.\nTheir recent and current work includes concerts at folk festivals such as the St Neots Folk Festival, the Ely Folk Festival and the Sidmouth Folk Festival. They have also run a Northumbrian piping workshop at the Cambridge Folk Festival since 2011. Achievements of band members include national solo, duet and composition championships in Northumbrian piping.\n\n\n== History ==\nCamus was formed by Greg Smith in 1980. The initial lineup with core members Jenny Tabecki (uilleann pipes), Chris McLeod (flute) and Brian Cleary (guitar and bouzouki) was strongly influenced by Irish music. Further lineup changes   saw the addition of Andrew Burn (vocals, guitar, melodeon) and David Somerville (bass, flute, whistle), who had played with Smith in Cambridge band Cobbler’s Last. After the arrival and departure of singer Gaynor Griffiths, the band settled to Smith, Burn, Somerville and Cleary, and singer Debbie Patterson-Jones, recording half of the album Then & Now at Spaceward Studios. After Patterson-Jones and Cleary’s departure, the album was completed (and released in 2003) with the arrival of Mike Nelson (guitar, mandolin and Northumbrian small pipes).  Nelson is also known as an instrument-maker, most notably for the set of pipes used by Kathryn Tickell. This lineup also played as The Great Eastern Ceilidh Company, with the addition of Hazel Smith (hammered dulcimer), playing throughout East Anglia and featuring at the Cambridge Folk Festival in 1991. Under the name of the Great Eastern Ceilidh Company, they released the album Cold Fen on CD in 2013. They dissolved as a ceilidh band and song band in 2018, and reformed  under the original name of Camus as a trio (Smith, Burn and Somerville). At the St Neots Folk Festival in 2019 they were described by Danny Neill as “a lively traditional three-piece whose jigs and reels instrumentals close Friday night with a bang.” \nTheir 2020 EP Time & Again, launched on Cambridge 105 Radio’s Strummers & Dreamers show, was praised by Paul Cowdell in Folk London magazine: “The songs and tunes here have lovely, dynamic arrangements. This is poised and sophisticated stuff. Evoking Lester Simpson’s writing – very much not a criticism – this has kept me coming back. Impressive.”  Joined by former band member Brian Cleary in 2022, they recorded the Out on the Spree album, launching it at the Cambridge Folk Club in June 2023. It was described by David Kidman for Folk London as “a polished and attractive collection … consistent musicianship on display.” \n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nThen & Now (CD album, Camus, 2003)\nCold Fen (CD album - Great Eastern Ceilidh Company, 2013)\nTime & Again (digital-only EP, streaming services and Bandcamp, Camus, 2021)\nOut on the Spree (CD & digital download, streaming services and Bandcamp, Camus, 2023)\n\n\n=== Other projects and collaborations ===\nNorthumbrian Piping Workshops Piping workshops at the Cambridge Folk Festival, with pipers from London and Northumberland (2011-).

        "content": "On 24 March 2024, a Mw 6.9 earthquake occurred in the East Sepik Province of Papua New Guinea, killing five people.\n\n\n== Tectonic setting ==\nThe island of New Guinea lies within the complex zone of collision between the Australian and Pacific Plates. Within this overall setting, the active tectonics of northern Papua New Guinea is dominated by the effects of continuing collision between the Huon–Finisterre island arc terrane with the edge of the Australian continental margin. The overall shortening is focused into two zones of thrust faulting, the Ramu–Markham fault zone, which forms the southwestern boundary of the Huon–Finisterre terrane, and the Highlands Thrust Belt, which lies further southwest and deforms the Australian margin.\nIn April 2023, a magnitude 7.1 earthquake 21 km (13 mi) southeast of the March 2024 event killed eight people.\n\n\n== Earthquake ==\nThe earthquake occurred at 06:22:04 PGT (20:22 UTC), with an epicenter located 4 km (2.5 mi) north of Chambri Lake, or 38 km (24 mi) east-northeast of Ambunti. It also had a hypocenter 40.2 km (25.0 mi) deep. It had a maximum Modified Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe), and according to the PAGER service of the United States Geological Survey, shaking of intensities VI-VII (Strong-Very Strong) was felt by an estimated 436,000 residents in East Sepik and Sandaun Provinces. Tremors were also felt in Madang Province and in Goroka, Eastern Highlands Province.\n\n\n== Impact ==\n\nThe earthquake killed five people, injured two others and destroyed around 1,000 homes. East Sepik provincial police commander Christopher Tamari warned that the death toll could rise as emergency teams were trying to reach remote areas. Two of the deaths occurred in Angoram and another died in Gawi. Many more unconfirmed fatalities were reported in remote villages near the epicenter. At the time of the earthquake, the province was affected by severe flooding along the Sepik River, which exacerbated damage and casualties from the earthquake. Most houses in the area were made of wood and thatched roofing. Many residents were unable to flee when the earthquake struck, as the inundation reached the chest level in some areas. In the village of Sotmeri, which was experiencing major flooding at the time of the earthquake, all 45 houses collapsed, killing a three-year-old child who drowned after being pinned down by debris when their residence collapsed into floodwaters, while 50 houses were destroyed in the neighbouring village of Korogu. Fishermen out in the water said that waves started building up in rivers when the earthquake struck.\nAt Kamanibit village in Angoram District, 39 houses collapsed and were submerged beneath floodwaters, while another 11 houses collapsed in the nearby village of Jikinumbu, killing a seven-year-old girl and her mother. Thirty-five houses collapsed in Kawarari. In Yenjimangua, seven houses were destroyed while in Niaurange, eight houses collapsed into floodwaters. A landslide occurred in Yangoru-Saussia District, burying several gardens. In Maprik District, six casualties were recorded from Maprik town and two from Yangoru. A high school in the district was also damaged, while in Wewak, two oxygen cylinders at the Boram General Hospital exploded during the earthquake. A bridge connecting the town to the Papua New Guinea Defence Force garrison at Moem Barracks also collapsed.\nAllan Bird, the governor of East Sepik, said that the earthquake had “damaged most parts of the province”, with the worst affected areas being Angoram, Wosera-Gawi and Ambunti-Dreikikier Districts, as well as areas along the Sepik River and wetlands. The International Organization for Migration estimated that the earthquake and preceding floods displaced about 10,000 people and affected 400,000 others in East Sepik and Highlands Region, and left more than 1,000 houses destroyed. Eighty-six schools in Ambunti, Wosera-Gawi and Angoram suspended classes indefinitely due to the effects of the earthquake and floods.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nA state of emergency was declared in East Sepik Province on 25 March due to the effects of the earthquake as well as the preceding floods. while the provincial government released 200 thousand kina in relief funds, to be augmented later with five million kina. Prime Minister James Marape later announced that the national government would allocate 500 million kina (US$132 million) towards disaster relief. The Second Battalion of the Papua New Guinea Defence Forces' Royal Pacific Islands Regiment based in Moem Barracks was ordered by the defence ministry to mobilize its assets to help in disaster response. A civilian helicopter was deployed to Wewak to assist in relief operations, to be augmented a military helicopter. Governor Bird requested assistance from the US embassy in Port Moresby for the purchase and delivery of 5,000 water filters and buckets. Samaritan Aviation, USAID, the International Organization for Migration and Vodafone also provided assistance to affected communities. The US released a combined total of 3.45 million kina ($900,000) for humanitarian aid for victims of the earthquake and the preceding floods. A donation drive was launched by students and faculty at the Papua New Guinea University of Technology in Lae.\nOn 29 March, Defence Minister Billy Joseph visited Wewak to look into the disaster response. He also announced the deployment of a C-27 aircraft by the Australian Government to the city carrying humanitarian aid, which arrived on 30 March. On 30 and 31 March, Marape visited East Sepik and other areas affected by the earthquake and the preceding floods. He estimated that the combined total damages from the disasters had cost 221 million kina.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of earthquakes in 2024\nList of earthquakes in Papua New Guinea\n2002 Sandaun earthquake\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Bergen Toy & Novelty Company (Beton for short) was an American toy manufacturer based in Carlstadt, New Jersey. The company began in 1932 as Marcak Toy & Novelty Company and became the Bergen Toy & Novelty Company in 1936. The company was founded by Charles Marcak and his wife Elsie. It was named after the county in New Jersey in which it was located.\nBeton originally produced hollow cast lead toys but switched to cellulose acetate in 1938. This decision made the company the first producer of plastic military figures commonly known as army men. Beton toys were popular through the 1950s, but the company stopped production in 1958 due to increased competition from less expensive foreign companies.\n\n\n== Varieties ==\nBeton primarily made hard plastic figurines sold as boxed sets or as individual figures displayed on spinners in dimestores, grocery stores, and drug stores. They sold toy soldiers, cowboys and Indians, firemen, policemen, farmers, railroad workers, townspeople, zoo animals, and circus performers. Their figures were often attached to a separately molded plastic base, marked \"Beton\" and \"Made in USA\" on the bottom. Later figures were molded as a single piece, with the base incorporated. The faces and some of the clothing on the figures were hand painted.\nDuring the 1940s, Beton cowboys and Indians were packaged with Lincoln Logs, replacing the smaller lead figures that were previously included.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDimestore soldiers\nList of toys\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "63rd Infantry Regiment is a reserve unit of Philippine Army activated and organized during World War II. I was organized from reservist and recruits high school and college students around the 6th Military District. It is part of the 61st Infantry Division activated to cover the island of Panay. The regiment fought entirely in Panay island until it was ordered to surrendered on May 12, 1942.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe regiment was initially commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Albert F. Christie upon its activation in November 1941. However, then Colonel Bradford Chynoweth the newly designated commander of the 61st Infantry Division selected Christie as his division Chief of Staff. He was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Carter McClennan as its commander in late November.  It was inducted to USAFFE on November 15, 1941. Training and organization was still on going when World War II in the Philippines started in early December 1941. Panay island was subject to aerial bombardment after forces in Luzon retreat in Bataan.\nOn January 1, 1942, General Sharp ordered General Chynoweth to send 61st and 62nd Infantry regiments and the 61st Field Artillery to Mindanao, leaving only 63rd Infantry as its combat unit in the island.\n\n\n=== Order of Battle ===\nStaff\nCO – LCol. Richard A. Kenney | LCol James Bickerton | LCol Carter McLennan\nXO – Major Richard A. Kenney\nS1 & Adjutant\nS2 Intelligence – 1Lt. Donald A. Amend\nS3 Operations – 1Lt. Adolph Newson Albrecht\nS4 Supply\nHQ Battalion – Capt. Julian Chaves\n1st Battalion – Capt. Lyton | Capt. Julian Chaves\n2nd Battalion – Major James Bickerton | Capt. Munroy\n3rd Battalion – Captain Woodroof\n\n\n=== Change of Command ===\nIn March 1942, General Chynoweth assumed the new command Visayan Force and transferred to Cebu island. Division was passed to Colonel Christie and 63rd Infantry Regiment passed on to Lieutenant Colonel Lyle Fritzpatrick after McClennan was ordered by Chynoweth to transfer to Negros to assume command of the island as Colonel Roger Hilsman health is a suspect and ordered him to moved to Cebu to recuperate. Later Lieutenant Colonel Richard A. Kenney took over the command.\n\n\n=== Operation Baus Au ===\nCommander of 61st Division, General Chynoweth, realizing they could not meet the Japanese at the beaches due to no artillery pieces arrived in the island, implemented Baus Au program which would bring foods, weapons, and other supplies inland and up to the hills which later he will implement in the entire Visayas islands as he assumed the Visayan Force in March. 63rd Infantry Regiment was the main unit involved in this operations as cargadores adopting the insignia of carabao sled.\n\n\n== Japanese Siege of Panay ==\nAfter Luzon Force capitulated in Bataan Peninsula, 14th Imperial Japanese Army now has available forces to capture the southern islands of the Philippines. Kawamura detachment was ordered by Homma to secure Panay, with 6 transport and 4 destroyer escorts arrived in Panay on April 16, 1942.   Landed in the three sites of the Panay island Jaro southeast of Panay just south of Iloilo City, Capiz town on the northwest, and in San Jose in Antique province at the west of the island.\n63rd Infantry and other regiments did not opposed these landings but melted inland and waited for the Japanese to go inland where they laid ambuscades resulting to heavy casualties to the Japanese. 63rd also conducted night raids in Iloilo City destroying and burning warehouses where Japanese supplies are stored. Because of this the Japanese could not penetrate inland of Panay island only concentrated their forces at the coast town and Iloilo City.\n\n\n=== Surrender ===\nOn May 12, 1942, Colonel Alberto F. Christie surrendered the Panay Garrison as ordered by Major General William F. Sharp commander of reconstituted Visayas-Mindanao Force due to no communication of Visayan Force HQ. Only handful of his men surrendered and the rest opted to stay in the mountains and continue the fight as guerillas.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== See also ===\nVisayas-Mindanao Force\nVisayan Force\n61st Infantry Division\nBradford Chynoweth\n\n\n=== External links ===\nThere were others, unpublished papers of Colonel Hiram Tarkington, CO 61st Field Artillery\nUnpublished papers of Colonel Carter McLennan CO 63rd Infantry, Negros Force",

        "content": "Tampere metropolitan area or Tampere region (Finnish: Tampereen seutu, Swedish: Tammerfors region) is the metropolitan area around the city of Tampere in Finland. The joint municipal authority of the Tampere city region (Finnish: Tampereen kaupunkiseutu, Swedish: Tammerfors stadsregion) consists of eight municipalities: Tampere, Kangasala, Lempäälä, Nokia, Orivesi, Pirkkala, Vesilahti and Ylöjärvi. The Tampere metropolitan area forms a compact, urban-like regional growth centre where people commute from a relatively large area of the Pirkanmaa region.\nThe Tampere metropolitan area has a population of about 417,000, making it the second largest region in Finland after Helsinki. The terms Tampere metropolitan area, Tampere region, Tampere city region, Greater Tampere and the other terms used are not fixed and may vary in different contexts.\nTampere metropolitan area differs from the Tampere sub-region (Finnish: Tampereen seutukunta), which also includes the municipalities of Hämeenkyrö, Kuhmoinen and Pälkäne. The Tampere sub-region is used for statistical purposes. It is based on cooperation between municipalities and the commuting area. The sub-region has a population of about 435,000.\n\n\n== Public services ==\nPublic transport in the Tampere area is managed by Nysse. In addition to Tampere, the service area includes Kangasala, Lempäälä, Nokia, Orivesi, Pirkkala, Vesilahti and Ylöjärvi. Valkeakoski uses the Nyssen Ticketing system, but transport is organized by the city of Valkeakoski and the Pirkanmaa ELY-Centre.\nPublic water services in the cities of Tampere and Pirkkala are managed by Tampere Water. It also provides partial services in the municipalities of Nokia, Lempäälä, Kangasala and Ylöjärvi. Tampere Water is responsible for the supply, treatment and distribution of clean water, the construction and maintenance of networks, the transport of wastewater, rainwater and snowmelt, the maintenance of the sewerage system and the treatment of wastewater. Its activities are governed by licences, laws and regulations.\n\n\n== Joint municipial authority ==\nThe joint municipal authority of the Tampere city region organises the regional cooperation of the municipalities such as the regional planning of the municipal structure, the development of services and business cooperation.\nThe highest decision-making authority in the Tampere city region is exercised by the general assembly, which, among other things, elects the regional noard and approves the budget. The task of the 13-member regional board is to initiate cooperation projects and present regional solutions to the member municipalities. The regional board is supported by the municipal councils, whose task is to promote and participate in the preparation of issues in the municipalities. Issues are prepared in regional working groups such as land use and housing, transport, social services and infrastructure services. \n\n\n== Municipalities ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nHelsinki metropolitan area\nTurku metropolitan area\n\n\n== References ==",

        "revision_id": 1219088020,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The genocide of Indigenous Australians refers to the systematic and deliberate actions taken primarily by European settlers, particularly during the 18th to the 20th centuries, aimed at eradicating Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures, languages, and people. Motivations for the genocide varied, and included motivations aimed at preserving a 'white Australia', or assimilating Indigenous populations 'for their own good'.This dark chapter in Australian history included mass killings in the frontier wars, forced removals of children (now known as the Stolen Generations), and policies of forced assimilation that sought to extinguish Indigenous Australian identity and cultural practices.\n\n\n== Historical context ==\nThe colonization of Australia by the British, starting in 1788, marked the beginning of a catastrophic impact on the Indigenous populations, who had lived continuously on the continent for around 60,000 years prior to European settlement. Some of the catastrophic impacts upon the indigenous population came about somewhat inadvertently (e.g. those caused by disease introduction, or agricultural displacement). However, other impacts upon the population were more deliberate, and would fairly be described by modern scholars as historical acts of genocide.\n\n\n== Acts of genocide ==\nSome acts of genocide perpetrated against Indigenous Australians included:\n\nMassacres: particularly in the frontier wars, there were numerous recorded and unrecorded deliberate massacres of Indigenous Australians by colonists, and by Australian State Police and militias. These acts were often carried out pre-emptively, or in retaliation against, violent resistance by Indigenous Australians against the occupation of their lands. In some instances massacres were carried out merely due to motivations involving hatred and racial prejudice of the perpetrator.\nDispersal campaigns: some scholars have described extermination campaigns undertaken in the 1800s, aimed at dispersing and displacing indigenous Australians from their lands as a form of genocide. An example of this was a collaboration between white settlers and the State of Western Australia to erase the presence of Indigenous Australians from the southwest of WA between 1900 and 1940.\nForced removals: policies enacted by Australian state governments involved the forced removal of Indigenous children from their families. A well-known example of this practice has been acknowledged by the term 'Stolen Generations', whereby children were placed in institutions or forcibly adopted by non-Indigenous families with the intent of assimilating them into white society, and discouraging indigenous languages and culture. These policies were sometimes undertaken by eugenicists, such as A. O. Neville, and argued for on the basis of ostensible 'benefits' bestowed upon victims of the practice. It was a common early 20th century view that Indigenous Australians were dying out.\nAssimilation policies: other legislation and policies were designed to assimilate Indigenous Australians into European-Australian society. In many schools, children were punished for speaking their native language. Additional restrictions were placed on movement, marriage, employment, and the practice of traditional ceremonies and legal systems. Collectively, these policies have been argued by some scholars as an act of cultural genocide. Some scholars have argued against the characterization of these policies after 1945 as genocidal in intent, and have argued that they were aimed instead at ensuring survival of indigenous peoples.\nOngoing cultural genocidal policies: a minority of scholars consider genocidal structuring dynamics continue to operate in Australia, however the opinions of these scholars are a distinct minority opinion in genocide scholarship and popular discourse.\n\n\n== Legacy and recognition ==\nThe genocide of Indigenous Australians has left deep scars on communities in Australia, with ongoing impacts on cultural heritage, languages, and people groups. The recognition of historical injustices in Australia has been relatively slow. Efforts to acknowledge and reconcile these actions started toward the late 20th and early 21st centuries.\nOne watershed moment was the 'Bringing Them Home' report, which contained the findings of the federal government inquiry into the removal of thousands of Aboriginal children. The report argued that the Commonwealth Government was guilty of the crime of genocide; under the UN Convention defining genocide as \"intentional destruction of a racial, religious, national, or ethnic group\".Since 1998 Australia has acknowledged the harms caused to Indigenous Australians in a National Sorry Day on May 26. In addition, a formal apology was delivered to the Stolen Generations by prime minister Kevin Rudd on behalf of the Australian Parliament in 2008. In recent decades the Australian Government has pursued a policy titled 'Closing the Gap' partly in an effort to redress some of the harms caused by prior policy.\nThere remains ongoing debate about the characterization of the historical events that Indigenous Australians faced as a form of 'genocide'. Some argue that the actions meet the legal definition outlined in the United Nations Genocide Convention, while others express a contrary view. Scholars such as Robert van Krieken have argued that the debate often involves a continuing dispute as to how broadly the concept of genocide ought to be understood. Narrow conceptions of genocide are restricted to killing, whereas the broader definition includes other ways a human group can be 'eliminated', including the destruction of cultural identity. Some scholars have said in relation to this 'Australia's record on Indigenous Australians is at best ambiguous, and at worst an example of genocide by eugenics'.\n\n\n== Particular instances ==\n\n\n=== Black War ===\n\nThe near-destruction of Tasmania's Aboriginal population has been described as an act of genocide by historians including Robert Hughes, James Boyce, Lyndall Ryan, Tom Lawson, Mohamed Adhikari, Benjamin Madley, and Ashley Riley Sousa. The author of the concept of genocide, Raphael Lemkin, considered Tasmania the site of one of the world's clear cases of genocide and Hughes has described the loss of Aboriginal Tasmanians as \"the only true genocide in English colonial history\".\n\n\n=== Queensland Aboriginal genocide ===\n\nQueensland represents the single bloodiest colonial frontier in Australia. Thus the records of Queensland document the most frequent reports of shootings and massacres of indigenous people and the most disreputable frontier police force. Thus some sources have characterized these events as a Queensland Aboriginal genocide. In 2009 professor Raymond Evans calculated the Indigenous fatalities caused by the Queensland Native Police Force alone as no less than 24,000.\n\n\n== Current status ==\nSome scholars have argued that the genocide against Indigenous Australians continues, especially through contemporary cultural destructive policies. These scholars are part of a minority opinion in both formal academic scholarship on genocide and in popular discourse.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of massacres of Indigenous Australians\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Works cited ===",

        "content": "Enchylium limosum, commonly known as lime-loving tarpaper lichen, is a species of crustose to subfoliose lichen in the family Collemataceae. This unique lichen species possesses a gelatinous thallus with a dark coloration, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is found thriving in a diverse array of habitats spanning temperate to boreal-montane regions across Europe, North America, Africa, and Asia.\nThe ecological preferences of E. limosum include a notable affinity for calcareous soils, a characteristic that often leads to its colonization in environments disrupted by human activity. Habitats such as quarries and spoil heaps frequently host populations of this lichen. Despite its extensive geographical distribution, E. limosum is often underestimated and overlooked, particularly in Alpine regions where its occurrence is sporadic.\nConservation status of E. limosum present a nuanced picture, with its status varying across different regions. In some areas, it is designated as vulnerable or critically imperiled due to threats such as habitat loss and disturbance.\nE. limosum has undergone several taxonomic revisions throughout history. Originally described by Swedish botanist Erik Acharius in 1799 as Lichen limosus, it underwent reassignments by various taxonomists, ultimately receiving its current accepted name, Enchylium limosum, in 2013 by Mónica Andrea García Otálora, Per Magnus Jørgensen, & Mats Wedin. Throughout its taxonomic history, E. limosum has been associated with various synonyms, including Collema forissii Szatala, Collema glaucescens Hoffm., Collema viscosum A. Massal., among others.\n\n\n== Systematics ==\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe species Enchylium limosum, commonly known as lime-loving tarpaper lichen, derives its name from its original classification as Collema limosum, attributed to the Swedish botanist Erik Acharius. The specific epithet \"limosum\" is derived from the Latin word \"limosus\", meaning \"full of mud\" or \"slime\", which aptly describes the dark, wet thallus characteristic of this lichen.\n\n\n=== Taxonomy ===\nEnchylium limosum was originally described by Swedish botanist Erik Acharius in 1799 under the name Lichen limosus in \"Lichenogr. Suec. Prodr.\"\nThroughout its taxonomic history, E. limosum has undergone several changes in nomenclature. Originally described by Ach. in 1799 as Lichen limosus, it was later reassigned by Ach. in 1810 as Collema limosum in \"Lich. Univ.\" Subsequent taxonomic revisions led to further adjustments, such as its classification as Collema glaucescens var. limosum by German lichenologist Julius von Flotow in 1850 and Collema pulposum var. limosum by British lichenologist William Mudd in 1861.\nIn 1891, German botanist Kuntze (1843–1907) identified it as Gabura limosa in \"Revis. gen. pl.,\" followed by its recognition as Collema cheileum var. glaucescens by Russian lichenologist Elenkin in 1904. British lichenologist Arthur Reginald Horwood further reassigned it as Eucollema glaucescens in 1912.\nFinally, in 2013, Mónica Andrea García Otálora, Per Magnus Jørgensen, & Mats Wedin proposed its current accepted name, Enchylium limosum. This taxonomic revision was proposed in 2013, and subsequently published in the journal \"Fungal Diversity\" in 2014.\n\n\n=== Synonymy ===\nEnchylium limosum, formerly recognized under various synonyms, has undergone taxonomic revisions over time, leading to a list of historical names found in scientific literature. These synonyms include Collema forissii Szatala, Collema glaucescens Hoffm., Collema viscosum A. Massal., Collema limosum (Ach.) Ach., Collema pulposum var. limosum (Ach.) Mudd, Eucollema glaucescens (Hoffm.) Horw., Gabura limosa (Ach.) Kuntze, Lichen crispus limosum (Ach.) Lam., Lichen limosus Ach., and Parmelia limosa (Ach.) Ach.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nEnchylium limosum is a diminutive crustose to subfoliose lichen species that forms a delicate, gelatinous thallus ranging from 100 to 500 micrometers in thickness when fully hydrated. The thallus has a distinctive dark olive-green to brownish-black coloration and a textural appearance that can vary from granulose to membranous. While the thallus margins are often indistinctly lobed, the lichen's vegetative structure is typically best developed in the areas surrounding the apothecia. Notably, E. limosum lacks both an upper and lower cortical layer.\nThe apothecia of E. limosum are profuse, lecanorine in structure, and sessile, measuring 1 to 3 millimeters in diameter, occasionally reaching up to 4 millimeters. The apothecial disc displays a flat to convex topography, ranging in color from reddish-brown to dark brown-black, and is bordered by a thick, often verrucose or lobulate thalline margin. Microscopically, the thalline exciple is either ecorticate or only pseudocorticate in the basal regions, while the proper exciple is poorly developed, composed of euthyplectenchymatous (elongated) or, more rarely, subparaplectenchymatous hyphae, and reaches up to 40 micrometers in lateral width.\nThe hymenium of E. limosum is colorless, measuring 80 to 120 micrometers in height, and exhibits a positive reaction to iodine staining (I+ blue). The paraphyses are simple or sparsely branched in their upper portions, 1.5 to 2 micrometers thick at the mid-level, and terminate in clavate to subglobose apical cells that are 3 to 4.5 micrometers wide. The hypothecium ranges from colorless to pale yellow in appearance.\n\nThe asci of E. limosum are cylindrical-clavate in shape, containing (2-) 4 spores, with a distinctly thickened apex and a downwardly projecting, deeply blue-staining (K/I+) tubular structure. The ascospores themselves are muriform or submuriform, possessing 3 to 5 transverse septa and 1 to 2 longitudinal septa, hyaline in color, and ellipsoid to subovoid in shape with obtuse to rarely subacute ends, measuring (20-) 25 to 35 (−40) micrometers in length and (8-) 10 to 15 (−17) micrometers in width. Notably, the ascospores of E. limosum are around 30 micrometers in length.\nPycnidia, when present, are infrequent, either immersed or slightly projecting, appearing as small reddish dots, and produce straight, bacilliform conidia that are 4 to 6 micrometers long and 1 to 1.8 micrometers wide. The photobiont of E. limosum is a cyanobacterium, specifically Nostoc, with the cells arranged in elongated chains.\nPycnidia, when present, are infrequent, either immersed or slightly projecting, appearing as small reddish dots, and produce straight, bacilliform conidia that are 4 to 6 micrometers long and 1 to 1.8 micrometers wide. The photobiont of E. limosum is a cyanobacterium, specifically Nostoc, with the cells arranged in elongated chains. All spot tests conducted on this lichen species yield negative results, and no secondary metabolites have been detected.\nE. limosum is considered a diminutive lichen species, characterized by its crustose thallus that is often more developed in the areas surrounding the relatively large and conspicuous apothecia, which contain 4-spored asci.\nE. limosum is recognized as a typical pioneer species, commonly colonizing bare, often calcareous soils, including anthropogenic habitats such as quarries and spoil heaps, though its presence in these areas is generally temporary.\n\n\n== Chemistry ==\nEnchylium limosum does not contain any detectable lichen substances or secondary metabolites.\nE. limosum exhibits negative reactions to all standard spot tests.\nThe species is found on substrates with a relatively acidic pH, ranging from 3 to 4. This indicates that E. limosum favors growing on subacid to subneutral substrates, such as those found in moderately disturbed environments.\n\nIn terms of solar irradiation, E. limosum prefers sites with plenty of diffuse light but limited direct solar exposure, scoring a 3 on the 5-point scale. This suggests the species avoids both extremely shaded and highly sun-exposed situations.\nThe aridity tolerance of E. limosum is classified as mesophytic, with a value of 3 on the 5-point scale. This indicates the species can thrive in habitats with moderate moisture levels, neither too dry nor too wet.\nRegarding eutrophication, E. limosum is found in areas with weak to moderate levels of nutrient enrichment, scoring 2–3 on the 5-point scale. This implies the species can tolerate some degree of environmental pollution or nutrient deposition, but likely avoids heavily eutrophicated sites.\nIn terms of poleotolerance, E. limosum is classified as occurring in moderately disturbed areas, with a value of 2 on the 4-point scale. This suggests the species is not exclusively found in natural or undisturbed habitats but can also colonize semi-natural environments with some level of human activity.\nFinally, the altitudinal distribution of E. limosum spans the montane belt (value of 3) and the submediterranean belt (value of 2). This indicates the species is adapted to grow in mid-elevation habitats, typically associated with deciduous Quercus-Carpinus forests and Fagus-dominated stands.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nEnchylium limosum is a widely distributed lichen species with a holarctic range, occurring across temperate to boreal-montane regions of Europe, North America, Africa, and Asia. Within Europe, the species has been recorded from a number of countries, including Italy, the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Czech Republic, Austria, Switzerland, and France.\nRegarding its specific distribution within Europe, E. limosum has been documented in the following regions and localities:\n\n\n=== Italy ===\nEnchylium limosum have a limited distribution within Italy, with the majority of known populations located in the southern regions of the country. The species seems to thrive primarily in the montane and submediterranean belts, with isolated occurrences recorded in Calabria, Campania, and Sardinia.\nIn Calabria, a single population of E. limosum has been documented in the Tarsia al Lago locality, situated within the montane belt. Similarly, in the Campania region, the species has been found in the Monti di Castellammare area, which falls within the submediterranean ecological zone.\nThe island of Sardinia also plays host to a known occurrence of E. limosum, with a population recorded along the western coast near the town of Buggerru, again within the submediterranean belt.\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nIn the United Kingdom and Ireland, the species is considered locally distributed but widely scattered, with records from damp clay soils and exposed, soft coastal cliff faces.\n\n\n=== Czech Republic ===\nIn the Czech Republic, E. limosum occurs abundantly throughout the country, with habitats being quarries, spoil heaps, and setting pits.\n\n\n=== Outside Europe ===\nOutside of Europe, this lichen has been recorded in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, and Quebec, as well as the U.S. state of Minnesota. In the Canadian North, E. limosum has been documented in the Southern Arctic and Taiga Plains ecozones, typically growing on calcareous soils.\n\n\n=== Ecology ===\nEcologically, Enchylium limosum is considered a typical pioneer species, commonly colonizing bare, often calcareous soils in disturbed habitats such as quarries, spoil heaps, and setting pits. However, its presence in these anthropogenic environments is generally temporary, as the lichen is quickly outcompeted by other vegetation.\nWithin its distribution range, E. limosum has been observed growing on a variety of substrates, including mineral, clay, and sandy soils, as well as on terricolous mosses and plant debris. The species appears to prefer substrates that are somewhat calcareous in nature. Altitudinally, it has been recorded from the mesomediterranean belt, where the potential vegetation is dominated by evergreen broad-leaved forests with Quercus ilex, up to the montane belt, where deciduous forests with Fagus sylvatica and closed coniferous forests with Picea abies are the predominant vegetation types.\nDespite its wide distribution, E. limosum is generally considered an overlooked and uncommon lichen species, particularly in the Alps region.\n\n\n=== Commonness and rarity ===\nEnchylium limosum is completely absent from the alpine belt, subalpine belt, oromediterranean belt, Padanian area, and dry mediterranean belt.\nIn the montane belt, the species is extremely rare, with only a few known populations.\nEnchylium limosum is also extremely rare in the submediterranean belt.\nThe species is very rare in the humid submediterranean belt and the humid mediterranean belt, with just a handful of recorded occurrences in these regions.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\n\nThe conservation status of the lichen species Enchylium limosum varies considerably across its known geographic range, with limited and sometimes conflicting assessments available.\n\n\n=== Global status ===\nAt the global level, the species' conservation status has not been comprehensively evaluated, and it is currently listed as Not Ranked (GNR) by NatureServe.\n\n\n=== Canada ===\nIn Canada, Enchylium limosum's status differs significantly between provinces and territories. According to NatureServe, it is considered Critically Imperiled (S1?) in Nova Scotia, Vulnerable (S3) in British Columbia and Ontario, and Unranked (SNR) in Prince Edward Island and Quebec. The species' status is also listed as Unresolved (SU) in Manitoba, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut.\nIn the Northwest Territories of Canada, the General Status Rank for E. limosum is Undetermined, with a status rank of SU, indicating that further inventory and assessment are required to determine its conservation status.\nE. limosum has been designated as S1 (Critically imperiled) by Atlantic Canada Conservation Data Centre.\n\n\n=== USA ===\nAcross the border in the United States, the national status of Enchylium limosum is Unranked (NNR), and it is also Unranked (SNR) in the only state for which data is available, Minnesota.\nMinnesota Department of Natural Resources have listed E. limosum in their \"Plant and Fungi watchlist\" due the species' recent decline in the state.\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nConversely, in Great Britain, the species is assessed as Least Concern (LC) according to the NBN Atlas Partnership and the British Lichen Society, suggesting it is not currently considered a conservation priority in that region.\n\n\n=== Finland ===\nAccording to the Finnish Biodiversity Information Facility, Enchylium limosum has been assessed for inclusion in the Red List of Finnish Species on multiple occasions.\nIn the most recent assessment, conducted in 2019, the species was categorized as Vulnerable (VU). The main criteria that led to this categorization were related to the species' small population size (D1).\nThe key threats identified for E. limosum in Finland include:\n\nOvergrowing of meadows and other open habitats (N)\nConstruction and development on the land (R)\nOther known reasons (Muu)\nThreats caused by alien species (Vie)\nPrior to the 2019 assessment, E. limosum had also been evaluated in previous Red List assessments for Finland:\nIn the 2010 Red List, the species was again categorized as Vulnerable (VU).\nHowever, in the earlier 2000 Red List assessment, E. limosum was listed as Not Evaluated (NE), indicating that a comprehensive conservation status evaluation had not been conducted at that time.\n\n\n=== Others ===\nThe 2019 Red List of Estonian lichens designates E limosum as a Vulnerable (VU) species in the region.\nIn the Czech Republic, E. limosum was previously categorized as Near Threatened (NT) by Institute of Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences . However, a more recent assessment has elevated the species to the Endangered (C3) category.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Enchylium limosum at Wikimedia Commons\n Data related to Enchylium limosum at Wikispecies\nNorth American Lichen Checklist, Version (#20) 19 April 2015.\nEnchylium limosum in Index Fungorum.",

        "content": "The Small States of Europe Badminton Championships is a regional badminton tournament sanctioned by Badminton Europe to crown the best badminton players and teams between the microstates of Europe.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe idea of establishing a badminton tournament for the small states of Europe began in 2017 during the Badminton Europe Congress in Prague. Malta, Cyprus, and Monaco envisioned a team badminton event uniting small European states, as badminton is not part of the Games of the Small States of Europe (GSSE). The tournament was then confirmed and planned to be held biennially starting from 2020 in Larnaca, Cyprus, with Monaco hosting the second edition. However, the tournament was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe championships were finally materialised in November 2023 when Malta successfully hosted the inaugural edition of the championships in Cospicua. In the inaugural edition of the championships, only the mixed team event was held.\n\n\n== Nations participating ==\n\n\n== Championships ==\n\n\n== Past winners ==\n\n\n=== Individual event ===\n\n\n=== Team event ===\n\n\n== References ==",

This extension follows the establishment of a new insurance obligation by the ALUR Law of 2014.\n\n\n== Operations ==\nThe composition of the CTB is determined by Article R.250-1 of the Insurance Code, an article modified by the 2015 decree.Its President is Professor Laurent Leveneur. He is chosen from among Council of State counselors, Court of Cassation counselors, Court of Auditors master counselors, or professors of legal disciplines at universities, whether active or emeritus.Each branch is represented equally by representatives of those subject to the insurance obligation and insurers, who are appointed for a renewable period of three years.\nA government commissioner, appointed by the Minister of Finance, attends all debates.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBureau central de tarification",

        "content": "Massaua was the name in Italian language of the Eritrean city-port Massawa during Italian rule.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Eritrean city of Massaua (now called \"Massawa\" or originally \"Mitsiwa\") was a colony of the Kingdom of Italy since the late 1890s until 1947, when Italy surrendered all the colonies in the peace Treaty after WW2.\n\nIn those seven decades the city grew from a small village to a cosmopolitan city of nearly 100,000 inhabitants within the hinterland, that was the main port or Eritrea. After WW1 the city had an \"urban plan\".\nEritrea officially became an Italian colony in 1890 and Massawa – already the seat of the colonial administration since 1885 – was declared the capital (but only for a few years until 1900 when the capital was established in Asmara). \nOn August 14, 1921, a violent earthquake occurred which destroyed 80% of the buildings. During the Government of Jacopo Gasparini, from 1923 to 1928, it was rebuilt and became an important center for the marketing of products and raw materials from all over Ethiopia, with the establishment (1925) of the free port and with the expansion of the town to the island of Taulud, where the railway station and the church with a Catholic mission were also built. \nIn 1932 the port-city was connected to Asmara by a railway: the Eritrean Railway, later expanded to Keren while projected until Tesseney and possibly to Kassala in Sudan.\nIn 1937 was inaugurated between Massaua and Asmara a big cableway (considered a world engineering masterwork in that year): the Asmara-Massawa Cableway. At 75 kilometres (47 mi) long, it was the longest ropeway conveyor in the world at the time.\nIn the growing city was created an industrial area with ship repair yards, fish processing industries, of which the Red Sea is particularly prodigal, a grandiose cement factory and a large sea water distillation plant capable of 30 tons of ice and 700 tons of distilled water per day. Also a modern hospital was inaugurated in 1938.\nThe airport of Massaua was usually called \"Otumlo aeroporto\" and was opened by the Italian authorities in 1935, when the Italian invasion of Ethiopia began, under the official name Aeroporto internazionale di Massaua. It was initially used for military aircraft employed in the invasion, and for military transport into conflict areas. In 1936, Ala Littoria, a civilian service with postal service from Massaua toward Asmara and Mogadishu, began operation at the airport.\nIn the late 1930s the port of Massaua was served by international ocean liners, like the MS Vulcania and the Conte Biancamano, that also served the Port of Mogadiscio in Somalia and Genova in Italy.\n\nThe city in 1939 was second in Eritrea only to Asmara for the number of Italian citizens & military residents (they were nearly 10000): they used to live an italian way of life, going to the 3 cinemas just opened and to the many cafes & restaurants in the walking & strolling areas of the city.\nA wider expansion of port areas on the island of Massawa was interrupted by Italy's entry into the war in 1940.\nIn spring 1941 the city was conquered by the British and suffered heavy damages, while the port was blocked by the Italians with the sinking of many ships.\nIn summer 1941 Massaua was still administered by the italians -who were then receiving orders from the British- and had a \"metropolitan\" population of more than 105,000 (of which nearly 10,000 were italians). But soon the colonists disappeared and in 1946 -after the end of WW2- there were only one thousand of them in the city-port. \nIn Massawa actually there are only a few dozen of Italo-eritreans (descendants from italian fathers & grandfathers) and only some buildings remain of the Italian colonization decades.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nItalian Eritrea\nItalian Empire\nAsmara-Massawa Cableway\nEritrean Railway\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBertarelli, Luigi Vittorio. \"Guida d'Italia: Possedimenti e colonie\".

        "content": "Siarhei Liakhovich vs. Shannon Briggs was a professional boxing match contested on 4 November 2006, for the WBO heavyweight championship.\n\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing his capture of WBO title in a slugfest with Lamon Brewster, Siarhei Liakhovich agreed to make his first defence against former Lineal Heavyweight Champion Shannon Briggs. The bout was to be held in Phoenix, Arizona, close to Liakhovich's adopted home of Scottsdale.\nBriggs, who was on a 11 fight win streak (all by stoppage) since his 2002 loss to Jameel McCline, had last fought for a world title eight and half years earlier when he was stopped in five rounds by Lennox Lewis. His team had come to terms with Klitschko adviser Shelly Finkel to fight Wladimir Klitschko on 11 November at Madison Square Garden, however after the deal when unsigned Briggs opted to face Liakhovich, while Wladimir faced Calvin Brock.\nIn the pre fight press conference Briggs claimed that he was expecting to stop the champion early, saying \"I'm looking to get him out of there early, he's a young kid. One or two rounds.\" Liakhovich said he planned counter the expected early Briggs onslaught, \"I know he is going to come out swinging and I know he is going to try and throw a lot of hard punches, but he needs to think about every time he swings, he is going to get hit.\"\nOn the undercard Juan Diaz defended his WBA Lightweight Title against Fernando Angulo.\n\n\n== The fight ==\nThe crowd booed throughout most of the bout, which progressed at a slow and cautious pace with either man throwing many punches. With only 27 seconds a pair of heavy right hands from Briggs sent Liakhovich down. He beat the count but Briggs followed it up with three more punches and about to throw another when Liakhovich fell through the ropes without being hit, which prompted the referee to wave it off. It was a TKO at 2:59 of the 12th round. At the time of the stoppage Liakhovich led on all three scorecards 106–103, 106-103 and 105–104, meaning if he had made it back into the ring after the final knockdown he would have retained the title with a majority draw.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nSpeaking after the fight Liakhovich said \"I didn't fight my fight. I fought his fight, It just didn't happen. I took his best shot. He caught me right on the chin. It was just a lack of punches before. I wasn't right there.\" Briggs meanwhile called out Wladimir Klitschko, \"I've got a vendetta against him,\" he said in the post fight press conference. \"When it comes to feelings, I want him. If it's money, or something like that, then I've got to take somebody else. But feeling-wise, I want him for what they did to me.\"\nBrigg would make his first defence against his mandatory challenger Sultan Ibragimov in June 2007 (rearranged from March due to Brigg having pneumonia).\n\n\n== Undercard ==\nConfirmed bouts:\n\n\n== Broadcasting ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "United Nations Security Council Resolution 2728, adopted on 25 March 2024, demands an immediate ceasefire in the Israel–Hamas war during the month of Ramadan leading to a lasting sustainable ceasefire. It also demands the unconditional release of all hostages. The resolution received approval from 14 members, while the United States abstained from voting.\n\n\n== Background and procedures ==\nResolution 2728 was proposed by the E-10 (the non-permanent members) and followed the veto of a US draft resolution regarding a ceasefire in Gaza by China and Russia on 22 March 2024.\nA verbal amendment introduced by Russia reinserting the word \"permanent\" to qualify the ceasefire in the resolution's first operative paragraph received 3 votes in favour (Algeria, China, Russia), 11 abstentions and 1 against (United States) and therefore failed to pass due to an insufficient number of members voting in favour of the amendment.\nIt was reported that the Prime Minister of Israel stated that he would cancel an Israeli delegation trip to the US if it did not veto the resolution.\n\n\n== Text of the resolution ==\nThe Security Council,\nGuided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,\nRecalling all of its relevant resolutions on the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question,\nReiterating its demand that all parties comply with their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law and international human rights law, and in this regard deploring all attacks against civilians and civilian objects, as well as all violence and hostilities against civilians, and all acts of terrorism, and recalling that the taking of hostages is prohibited under international law,\nExpressing deep concern about the catastrophic humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip,\nAcknowledging the ongoing diplomatic efforts by Egypt, Qatar and the United States, aimed at reaching a cessation of hostilities, releasing the hostages and increasing the provision and distribution of humanitarian aid,\n1. Demands an immediate ceasefire for the month of Ramadan respected by all parties leading to a lasting sustainable ceasefire, and also demands the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, as well as ensuring humanitarian access to address their medical and other humanitarian needs, and further demands that the parties comply with their obligations under international law in relation to all persons they detain;\n2. Emphasizes the urgent need to expand the flow of humanitarian assistance to and reinforce the protection of civilians in the entire Gaza Strip and reiterates its demand for the lifting of all barriers to the provision of humanitarian assistance at scale, in line with international humanitarian law as well as resolutions 2712 (2023) and 2720 (2023);\n\n3. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.\n\n\n== Voting record ==\nPermanent members of the Security Council are in bold.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\n\n\n=== Nations ===\n\n\n==== Israel and Palestine ====\n Israel: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cancelled a delegation trip to the White House to discuss Rafah with a statement released citing \"a clear retreat from the consistent US position\". They also stated \"today’s resolution gives Hamas hope that international pressure will force Israel to accept a ceasefire without the release of our hostages, thus harming both the war effort and the effort to release the hostages.\" Israel's Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir argued that the Security Council resolution \"proves that the United Nations is anti-Semitic\" and that UN Secretary-General \"is anti-Semitic\". Gilad Erdan, Israel's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, called the resolution \"shameless\".\n Palestine: Permanent Observer to the UN Riyad Mansour welcomed the resolution whilst calling for its enforcement.\n Hamas: Hamas welcomed the resolution, stating they were ready \"to engage in an immediate prisoner exchange process that leads to the release of prisoners on both sides\".\n\n\n==== Security Council members ====\n China: Ambassador to the UN Zhang Jun stated, \"For the millions of people in Gaza who remain mired in an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe, this resolution, if fully and effectively implemented, could still bring long-awaited hope. Security Council resolutions are binding.\"\n France: Permanent Representative Nicolas de Rivière stated, \"The Security Council's silence on Gaza was becoming deafening. It is high time now for the council to finally contribute to finding a solution\".\n Malta: The Ambassador to the UN, Vanessa Frazier, highlighted how this was \"the first joint motion [from the non-permanent members] on a geographic situation in the council's history\" and that it sent a strong message to world leaders.\n Russia: Permanent Representative Vasily Nebenzya stated, \"We believe it is fundamentally important to vote in favour of peace. The council must continue to work on achieving a permanent ceasefire\".\n  Switzerland: The Federal Council stated in a press release that the resolution \"responds to the most urgent needs on the ground and must be implemented immediately\". It also highlighted how the \"decision by the Council underlines the weight of the non-permanent members of the Council\".\n South Korea: At a regular briefing, foreign ministry spokesman Lim Soo-seok said, \"We hope that the UNSC resolution will lead to a ceasefire agreement, the release of all hostages and a surge in humanitarian aid.\" A foreign ministry official said the resolution must be respected and \"faithfully implemented as it reflects the consensus of the international community\".\n United States: Permanent Representative Linda Thomas-Greenfield thanked members for adding some of the US edits, but also stated the lack of condemnation of Hamas meant it could not support the resolution. She further demanded of the Security Council to link the release of all hostages to any ceasefire, characterizing the resolution as \"non-binding\". The US State Department noted that the US abstention did not indicate a change in US policy, and also stated that the US saw the ceasefire resolution as nonbinding.\n\n\n==== Other nations ====\n Australia: Foreign Minister Penny Wong stated \"all parties to the conflict must comply\" with the resolution.\n Colombia: President Gustavo Petro called on the international community to break diplomatic ties with Israel if it did not comply with the resolution.\n Iran: The Foreign Ministry spokesman stated, \"A more important step than adopting this resolution would be effective action to implement it\".\n Jordan: Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi stated that the \"reaction by the Israeli government reflects the disdain with which it holds international law\".\n Lebanon: Prime Minister Najib Mikati called the resolution, \"A first step on the path to stopping the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip\".\n Qatar: The Foreign Ministry stated, \"The ministry stresses the importance of committing to implementing the resolution, especially the ceasefire, and allowing humanitarian aid urgently and without obstacles into the entire Gaza Strip\".\n South Africa: The Department of International Relations and Cooperation stated, \"It is now the responsibility of the United Nations Security Council to ensure that there is compliance with the resolution, which is binding on the parties\".\n Spain: Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said it was \"imperative that the resolution be implemented and humanitarian aid access be allowed\" into Gaza.\n Turkey: The Foreign Affairs spokesman stated, \"We hope that Israel will comply with the requirements of this resolution without delay\".\n\n\n=== Ceasefire negotiations ===\nIsrael claimed that the rejection of a ceasefire proposal by Hamas was due to the passing of 2728, with Netanyahu stating the Hamas response was a \"sad testament to the damage caused by the UN Security Council\". The Israeli team at Doha was also recalled. The US rejected the assertions describing them as \"inaccurate in almost every respect\".\n\n\n=== Other ===\nResponding to the passing of the resolution, Secretary-General António Guterres expressed his desire for implementation, posting that \"failure would be unforgivable\". In a statement, Doctors Without Borders said, \"Council members must ensure that the ceasefire is put into action immediately and doesn’t end up being merely words on paper.\" The head of Amnesty International stated the Resolution must be \"implemented immediately\". The Israel-Palestine director of Human Rights Watch stated, \"States should use all forms of leverage – including imposing arms embargo and targeted sanctions on Israel – to press it to comply. The lives of millions of Palestinians hang in the balance.\" The president of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen stated, \"Implementation of this resolution is vital for the protection of all civilians\".\n\n\n== Compliance ==\n\n\n=== Ceasefire ===\nThe day following the passage of the resolution, journalist Hind Khoudary reported, \"After the UN resolution passed, Palestinians thought that they won’t be bombed in the Gaza Strip. But still, Palestinians continue to be killed and wounded.\" Imran Khan, a journalist, wrote, \"Israel has a very long history of simply ignoring UN resolutions\". On 27 March, James Elder, a spokesperson for UNICEF, stated, \"There was so much hope in Gaza after Monday’s call for a ceasefire. That hope, night after night, is being drowned out by bombs\".\nBenny Gantz, a member of the Israeli war cabinet, stated the resolution had \"no operational significance\". Robert A. Wood, a U.S. diplomat, stated, \"The Israelis saw that resolution, they didn’t like it.\" Christos Christou, the international president of Doctors Without Borders, \"We haven’t seen any change after this resolution on the ground\".\n\n\n=== Hostages ===\nRegarding the second demand in operative paragraph 1 of the resolution, on 27 March Khaled Mashaal, the former head of Hamas's politburo, said that the hostages would remain captive until Israel halts hostilities, withdraws its troops, allows displaced civilians to return and ends its blockade of the Gaza Strip.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 2701 to 2800 (2023–present)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nFull text: UN Security Council Resolution 2728 (via undocs.org)\nVerbatim record: UN Security Council, 9586th meeting (via undocs.org)",

        "content": "Turkish comics were introduced to the Ottoman Empire in the 19th and early 20th centuries in the form of satirical cartoons along with modern journalism. From then on, comic strips and cartoons (karikatür in Turkish) in newspapers and humor magazines, which typically deliver political or social messages, have been the mainstay of comics in Turkey. Comics conveying longer narratives (çizgi roman, literary \"picture story\") are often regarded as children's reading material. Comic book production has not been developed as an established industry in Turkey, presumably overshadowed by foreign publications mainly from the U.S., Italy, or France.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ottoman period: 19th century-1920s ===\nSome argue that the development of Turkish comics has been impeded by the lack of a prehistory of portraiture, stemming from the Islamic prohibition on idolatry, which has persisted to the present day. It is worth noting that the Ottoman Empire did have a tradition of miniature painting that has narrative elements. While some contend that this tradition served as the foundation of Turkish comics, others argue that it was merely illustrations accompanying manuscript texts and thus lacks a direct connection to modern cartooning.\n\nModern cartoons flowed in as satirical cartoons in the pages of newspapers and magazines, which the Ottomans adopted as a part of Western modern culture during the Tanzimat period (1839–1876), a time when Westernization was actively promoted across various sectors of society. Early satirical cartoonists sometimes appropriated traditional shadow-play characters, Karagöz and Hacivat, who had long been integral to the satirical culture of the Turkish common people. However, with a literacy rate of less than 10% during this period, access to publishing media was limited to the elite. Diyojen, the pioneering Ottoman satirical magazine founded by newspaper editor Teodor Kasap , faced repression due to its criticism of the regime. The reign of Abdülhamit II brought a period of backlash, but critical journalism and satirical cartoons experienced a resurgence during the Second Constitutional Era (1908–1918). Prominent among the cartoonists of this period was Cemil Cem, who introduced a realistic and three-dimensional drawing style of the West, along with captions accompanying the cartoons.\nDuring World War I and the War of Independence, cartoonists who aligned with various political factions fought each other through their works in numerous short-lived magazines. Despite the political turmoil, a few magazines managed to endure, including Karagöz (1908–1951), which retained the tastes of 19th century satirical magazines, and Akbaba (1922–1977), which supported the sultanate government. These magazines persisted through the upheaval and continued to be published into the subsequent democratic era.\n\n\n=== From the establishment of the Republic to World War II: 1920s-1940s ===\n\nWith the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire and the establishment of the Republic of Turkey, newspapers and magazines targeting the general public began to proliferate. These publications featured humorous pieces presented in a format akin to present-day cartoons. Due to the popularization of readership, as well as government suppression of regime criticism, more and more works focused on daily life and social conditions instead of political satire. Notable cartoonists of this era include Cemal Nadir Güler, Ramiz Gökçe, and Sururi Gümen. Güler, not hailing from the intellectual elite, pioneered a stylized cartoonish approach that diverged from the conventions of modern Western art, gaining popularity among the common people. One of Güler's creations, Amcabey, an Istanbul gentleman, emerged as one of Turkey's earliest cartoon characters and attained national prominence. Gökçe, famed for his depictions of women and a rival figure to Güler, created Tombul Teyze (\"buxom auntie\"), who became a beloved figure among male readers of the time.\n\nIn around 1935, amidst the wave of Westernization under the regime of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, there was a surge in the popularity of American comic strips such as The Phantom, Mickey Mouse, Flash Gordon, and Tarzan in newspapers and magazines aimed at children. However, anti-capitalist and anti-American groups opposed allowing children to read these comics, leading to modifications in the settings and ideologies of these works. Main characters' names and appearances were altered to Turkish equivalents, while villains remained foreign. The first comic magazine, 1001 Roman, launched in 1939, became the most successful publication of its kind. However, Turkish publishers imported U.S. comics via Italy, which made it challenging for new works to enter the country once World War II began. Furthermore, concerns about the rapid Americanization also contributed to a decline in comics publishing. Nonetheless, it was during this period that young cartoonists such as Suat Yalaz, Faruk Geç, and Şahap Ayhan, who had previously emulated foreign works, began creating their own comics.\n\n\n=== Golden age: 1950s-1970s ===\nTurkish comics is often regarded as having entered a golden age between 1955 and 1975. Reforms in writing and art education implemented under the Republican regime fostered an environment in which artists could freely engage in creative pursuits. When Republican People's Party ended its one-party dictatorship in 1950, restrictions on journalism were temporarily loosened, paving the way for the emergence of the so-called \"50s generation\" of cartoonists. Among those were Turhan Selçuk, Semih Balcıoğlu, and Selma Emiloğul, the latter gaining attention as a young female cartoonist.\nAfter World War II, with Turkey largely aligned with the Free World, Turkish comics strongly reflected Western influence. Newspapers serialized Western long-form comic strips, which had a significant impact on circulation. Popular U.S. newspaper strips such as Blondie, Bringing Up Father, and Beetle Bailey gained prominence. In 1951, a solo comic book title featuring the western hero Pecos Bill from Italian comics became a 40,000-copy hit, followed by similar successes with works like Tex, Kinowa, and Zagor. Captain Miki, renamed \"Tomix\" in the Turkish version, became a favorite among children. From the late 1950s to the 1960s, there was an influx of French/Belgian comics (bande dessinée) such as Lucky Luke and Asterix. The popularity of titles like Tintin prompted the publication of unlicensed local versions. American superhero comics such as Superman initially garnered little interest and only gained popularity decades later, following the rise of superhero films.\nWorks by Turkish cartoonists in this era were characterized by anti-heroes that reflected the burgeoning middle class of the time. Among them was Abdülcanbaz, a con man trickster created by Turhan Selçuk in 1957. Over the years, Abdülcanbaz evolved into a good-hearted hero and remained active until the 2010s.\n\nWhen a coup d'état brought the military government to power in 1960, political and satirical cartoons disappeared from the newspapers, and many humor magazines ceased publication. Comic book publishing was also affected, leading to the rise of historical works with nationalistic themes. Many depicted male Turkish heroes triumphing over enemy armies and winning the hearts of pagan women one after another. Suat Yaraz's creation, Karaoğlan (1962), set during the age of Genghis Khan, became one of Turkey's most iconic characters. Karaoğlan comics were also published in France for over 100 issues and translated into English and German. Other works influenced by Karaoğlan include Tarkan, Kara Murat, and Malkoçoğlu, among others.\nDuring this period, translated Italian comic books such as Süper Teks, Zagor, and Kaptan Swing gained popularity, while Korku, founded in 1967, introduced American horror comics and iconic characters such as Vampirella and Conan the Barbarian to Turkish audiences. The 1960s also witnessed the resurgence of children's magazines like Zıp Zıp, along with the emergence of girls' magazines. Teen magazine Tina captured the imaginations of young female readers by featuring blonde, model-like protagonists leading modern, fashionable lives.\n\n\n=== Gırgır and the era of humor magazines: 1970s-1990s ===\nUntil this period, Turkish newspapers had not yet adopted advanced printing technology, resorting illustrations and cartoons due to limitations in photograph printing. However, with the introduction of offset printing in the 1970s, the landscape changed significantly. Cartoons and comics experienced a general decline in popularity and never fully recovered to their previous levels. Around 1971, comic books were selling a healthy 45,000 copies per issue, but this figure dwindled over the years. By the 1980s, horror comics such as Süper Korku had ceased publication altogether. Facing reduced payments, former newspaper cartoonists shifted their focus to other outlets such as magazines.\nThe humor magazine Gırgır (\"fun\"), founded by Oğuz Aral in 1972, provided a fresh critical perspective from the standpoint of the common man, supplanting grandiose satirical magazines aimed for intellectuals such as Akbaba. With a total circulation of one million copies, humor magazines including Gırgır and its offshoot Leman became virtually the sole medium for comics. The majority of works in these magazines were characterized by sarcasm and satire, often employing pejorative language. Avanak Avni (\"Avni the Gullible\"), a character created by Aral in Gırgır, embodied the common man as \"a representative of the average man of the time, bullied, dump but cunning,\" akin to Yellow Kid of early U.S. comic strip. Aral actively recruited newcomers to Gırgır, offering a platform for cartoonists who had transitioned from newspapers and nurturing talents who would shape the next generation. However, some view these artists as merely following in Aral's footsteps. Notable among those who emerged from Gırgır with distinctive styles are Galip Tekin and İlban Ertem, renowned for their realistic and pessimistic works.\nDuring the 1990s, several fanzines emerged within comic book fandom, yet they failed to gain attention from the general public, who didn't perceive comics as a serious art form. Although a handful of enthusiast comic magazines emerged (such as Zeplin, Rh+, and Resimli Roman), drawing inspiration from acclaimed bande dessinée artists like Mœbius and Enki Bilal, or from foreign comic book movements such as Métal hurlant and graphic novels, they were all short-lived.\nThe Turkish publishing industry faced significant challenges as television became widespread during this period. Reports indicate that the circulation of humor magazines dropped to one-fifth in the decade leading up to the mid-1990s. In response, these magazines shifted towards a more underground direction, avoiding direct competition with television by focusing on themes such as obscenity, sex, and cynicism. Simultaneously, the nature of satirical cartoons evolved with the emergence of a generation prioritizing personal lifestyles over traditional left-right political conflicts. L-Manyak, an offshoot of Leman magazine, gained prominence for its social commentary, often employing violent and obscene imagery that challenged conventional norms. In terms of art, the previously dominant minimalistic style has given way to more intricate and lifelike backgrounds. L-Manyak's style remained prevalent in Turkish cartoons in the 2010s. Notably, the magazine's Kötü Kedi Şerafettin (\"Bad Cat Sherafettin\") by Bülent Üstün, which was later adapted into an animated film in 2015, enjoyed popularity. Additionally, during this period, erotica such as Italian Druuna began to appear in magazines including the Turkish version of Playboy.\n\n\n=== Modern times: 2000s and Beyond ===\nHumor magazines remain vibrant and successful in the 2010s, described as \"one of the most successful publication categories in Turkey\" by the Turkish Directorate General of Press and Information. Contemporary Turkish comics primarily consist of cartoons satirizing social mores in popular humor magazines and political satires in mainstream press. Cartoons are recognized as a distinct art form alongside painting and sculpture, with dedicated research and critical journal, Gül Diken. On the other hand, long-form comic narratives often occupy a peripheral role.\nIn 2011, Bayan Yanı (\"On the Side of Women\"), the first satirical cartoon magazine from a woman's perspective, was launched.\nSince the 2000s, the graphic novel movement has made its way to the Middle East, with several works being produced in Turkey by creators who serve as both writers and artists. The Ministry of National Education has initiated a project to adapt Turkish and foreign literary works into graphic novels. Autobiographical works with a confessional tone have been published, such as Sandıkiçi by Ersin Karabulut and Öyle Bir Geçer Zaman Ki by M. K. Parker. Translations and publications from the works in English and French are also popular, although as of 2017, the only graphic novel with Turkey origin published in English is a memoir by Özge Samancı, Dare to Disappoint: Growing up in Turkey. Furthermore, foreign works that have been adopted into U.S. films or Japanese anime have also garnered popularity in Turkey.\n\n\n== Film adaptations ==\nThe first successful film adaptation of comics in Turkey was Cicican (1963), based on a comic inspired by the American comic strip Li'l Abner. Adaptations of period comic books gained popularity in the 1960s and 1970s, resulting in the production of seven Karaoğlan films, five Tarkan films, and eight Kara Murat films up until the 2010s. Additionally, the cartoon series Bizimkiler, featuring a fictional musical band, was adapted into the film Hüdaverdi-Pırtık in 1971. However, after the 1980s, adaptations of comics became less frequent, with only a few exceptions such as the animated film Kötü Kedi Şerafettin, which achieved popularity in the 2000s.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Works cited ===\nAksoy, Nüzhet Berrin (2016). \"The Adventures of the Graphic Novel in Turkey\".

        "content": "John “Jackie” McLaughlin (October 11, 1933 – August 23, 1964) was an American racing driver from the Thorofare section of West Deptford Township, New Jersey.  Although best remembered for his exploits in a dirt-track Modified, he won several United Racing Club Sprint car races and was their 1954 “Rookie of the Year”.\n\n\n== Racing career ==\nJackie McLaughlin started his racing career in 1950 at age 17 on the dirt at New Jersey's Atco Speedway and Alcyon Speedway in Pitman. By 1955 his brother-in-law, Budd Olsen, convinced him to try the Modifieds, and McLaughlin immediately won at the Nazareth Speedway PA.  He went on to compete successfully at the renowned tracks of the Mid-Atlantic, including Georgetown Speedway DE, Kent-Sussex Raceway DE, Reading Fairgrounds Speedway PA, and Vineland Speedway NJ.    McLaughlin entered the Daytona 300 in both 1959 and 1960, and claimed the 1962 track championship at the Flemington Speedway NJ.\nJackie McLaughlin sustained a fatal injury in a racing accident at Nazareth in August 1964.   He was inducted into the Eastern Motorsports Press Association and the  Northeast Dirt Modified Halls of Fame.\n\n\n== References ==",

In 2014, Kerem Company purchased 40% of Malka Brewery. Kerem paid 4.8 million shekels for 40% of Malka Beer, reflecting a value of about 12 million shekels for Malka Beer. In 2018, following the acquisition of Negev Beer by Kerem Company, Malka Brewery also began producing this brand. In 2020, the brewery started producing the Israeli beer brand \"Herzl\" as well.\n\n\n== Products ==\n\n\n=== Types of Beers ===\nMalka Wheat - In the style of American Wheat, 5% alcohol by volume.\nMalka Blonde - In the style of Belgian Blonde Ale, 6.5% alcohol by volume.\nMalka Red - In the style of English Pale Ale, 5.5% alcohol by volume.\nMalka Dark - In the style of Irish Stout, 6% alcohol by volume.\nMalka IPA - In the style of IPA, 6.2% alcohol by volume.\n\n\n=== Limited Edition Beer ===\nMalka Strong - 9% alcohol by volume.\nAll beers at Malka Brewery are unfiltered and do not contain preservatives.\n\n\n=== Distilled Malka ===\nIn August 2020, Malka Beer released a limited edition of a clean and transparent distillate with a strength of 44.4% alcohol by volume, produced by distilling \"Malka Blonde\".

        "content": "The Copley Street riot occurred on 13 August 1934, at the Copley Street Repository, Cork, Ireland after Blueshirts opposed to the collection of annuities from auctioned cattle rammed a truck through the gate of an ongoing cattle auction. The Broy Harriers  opened fire and one man, 22 year old Michael Lynch, was killed and several others injured.\n\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the Irish War of Independence (1919–1921), Britain relinquished its control over much of Ireland. However, aspects of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which had marked the end of the war, led to the Irish Civil War (1922–1923). The aftermath left Ireland with damaged infrastructure and hindered its early development.\nÉamon de Valera, who had voted against the Anglo-Irish treaty and headed the Anti-Treaty movement during the civil war, came to power in 1932 and was re-elected in 1933. While the treaty stipulated that the Irish Free State should pay £3.1 million in land annuities to Great Britain, and despite advice that an economic war with Britain could have catastrophic consequences for Ireland (as 96% of exports were to Britain), de Valera's new Irish government refused to pay these annuities – though they continued to collect and retain them in the Irish exchequer.\n\nThis refusal led to the Anglo-Irish trade war (also known as the \"Economic War\"), which persisted until 1935, when a new treaty, the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement, was negotiated in 1938. During this period, a 20% duty was imposed on animals and agricultural goods, resulting in significant losses for Ireland. Specifically, poultry trade declined by 80%, butter trade by 50% and cattle prices dropped by 50%. Some farmers were forced to kill and bury animals because they couldn't afford to maintain them.\nIn 1933, Fine Gael emerged as a political party—a merger of Cumann na nGaedheal and the National Centre Party. Fine Gael garnered substantial support from rural farmers who were particularly affected by the Economic War. They strongly objected to the collection of land annuities by the Fianna Fáil government. The Blueshirts, a paramilitary organisation founded as the Army Comrades Association in 1932 and led by former Garda Commissioner Eoin O’Duffy, transformed into an agrarian protest organisation, mobilising against seizures, cattle auctions, and those tasked with collecting annuities.\n\n\n== Riot ==\nEoin O'Duffy, a key figure in Irish politics, encouraged farmers to withhold payment of land annuities to the government. Arising from this stance, Gardaí started to seize animals and farm equipment, auctioning them to recover the outstanding funds. While seized cattle were auctioned, local farmers rarely participated. Instead, Northern Ireland dealers, often associated with the name O'Neill, were the primary buyers. These auctions were protected by the Broy Harriers, an armed auxiliary group linked to the police.\nBy 1934, tensions escalated, and a series of anti-establishment incidents were attributed to the Blueshirts. These incidents ranged from minor acts of violence, such as breaking windows, to more serious offenses like assault and shootings.\nOn 13 August 1934, an auction took place at Marsh's Yard in Copley Street in Cork, featuring cattle seized from farms in Bishopstown (Coveney) and Ballincollig. The police established a cordon by 10:00 a.m., with 300 officers on duty. Lorries arrived at 11:00 a.m.\nAround noon, three thousand protestors assembled. Within twenty-five minutes, an attempt was made to breach the yard gate by ramming it with a truck. According to Oireachtas records, there were approximately 20 men in the truck which they ran against the gate. The Minister for Justice P. J. Ruttledge, said that the truck \"with those people in it charged through those cordons of Guards; that several Guards jumped on to the lorry and tried to divert the driver by catching hold of the steering wheel and trying to twist it\". Some contemporary news sources suggest that the ramming truck knocked down the surrounding police cordon \"like ninepins and crush[ed] a police inspector against a gate\". Other, later, sources suggest that the senior officer (a superintendent) was injured in a fall, while attempting to avoid being struck, rather than being hit directly by the truck.\nA man named Michael Lynch (wearing the distinctive blue shirt) and approximately 20 others reportedly managed to enter the yard. As soon as they entered the yard they were fired upon by armed \"special branch\" police detectives who were in the yard. Lynch later succumbed to his injuries at the South Infirmary; 36 others were wounded.\nDespite the violence, the auction proceeded after a one-hour delay.\nFollowing the shooting, a riot ensued, but when news of Lynch's death reached the participants, they ceased rioting, knelt, and recited a Rosary.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\nThe funeral of Michael Lynch occurred on 15 August 1934. The funeral procession was planned to depart from Saints Peter and Paul's Church, Cork at 2:30 PM.\nThe occasion allowed for a significant show of force for Eoin O'Duffy and the Blueshirts, and featured Roman salutes and military drills. Farmers in Munster reportedly stopped work for an hour, and Blueshirt members asked shopkeepers to close their businesses, as a show of respect for the \"martyr\". Lynch was afforded a \"full Blueshirt burial\", and the coffin was adorned with the flag of the Blueshirts (the Army Comrades Association).\nAccording to the  Minister for Justice, at the funeral W. T. Cosgrave stood beside O'Duffy as the Blueshirt leader gave an oration saying \"We are going to carry on until our mission is accomplished [..] those 20 brave men, whose deed will live for ever, not only in Cork but in every county in Ireland, broke through in the lorry [..] all Blueshirts should try to emulate his bravery and nobleness. Every Blueshirt is prepared to go the way of Michael for his principles\".\nThe court granted the family £300 in 1935. This was appealed to the High Court, followed by the Supreme Court, which dismissed the case. In the Supreme Court, Judge Henry Hanna described the Broy Harriers as 'an excrescence' upon An Garda Síochána.\nWhen the matter was discussed in the Senate in September 1934, and before a vote was taken to \"[condemn] the action of the members of the special branch of the Gárda Síochána [..] on Monday, the 13th August 1934\", the senators who supported Éamon de Valera's government walked out.\nIn August 1940, a memorial was unveiled on the tomb of Lynch in Dunbulloge Cemetery in Carrignavar, County Cork, consisting of a limestone Celtic cross and pedestal. The pedestal is engraved with a quote from the American orator, William Jennings Bryan: \"The humblest citizen of all the land, when clad in the armour of a righteous cause is stronger than all the hosts of error\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPatriots to a Man, The Blueshirts and Their Times (2001) RTÉ documentary covering the roles played by \"lesser known\" Blueshirts including Michael Patrick Lynch",

        "content": "Gleaming waters is a painting by the British painter Henry Scott Tuke. It is the largest work he ever painted.\nThe composition of the painting shows a bathing scene with boys on the seashore in Cornwall. This painting had not been shown in Britain since the Royal Academy of Arts Summer Exhibition of 1911, where it was exhibited as number 441 and offered at the price of GBP400.\nThe painting was believed to be lost until its sale on 30 November 2000 by Christie’s in London.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe painting shows five boys on a sunny day on the beach in Cornwall. All the boys are in the sea, two of them in the water. Three of the boys are in the foreground. The one on the left hand side is sitting naked on a rock. The one in the middle is playing at the shallow water's edge. And the one on the right hand side, turning his back to the audience, is standing bare chested in the shallow water, wearing white pants, and looking to his friend, who is playing in the water. He holds his pinkish shirt in his hands that is being blown away by the wind.\nAt some distance, but still close to the shore, two other boys are visible. One is balancing on the pointed stones of a rock, the other is sitting in a white rowing boat with a light green coat of paint just above the water edge. \nThe sun is reflected in the azure blue, partly green gleaming water.\nCatherine Dinn states: \"Although Henry Scott Tuke would put extra details and the finishing touches to his bathing paintings in the studio, photographic evidence exists to demonstrate that he worked on these canvases largely in the open air, accounting for their freshness of colour and the sparkling effects of sunlight on the sea and the naked flesh of his models. In this respect he remained true to the plein-air precepts of the Newlyn School.\" \n\n\n== Location ==\nHenry Scott Tuke painted Gleaming waters in the summer of 1910. It is set on Newporth Beach, a part-sandy, part-shingly beach close to Tuke's cliff-top home just south of Falmouth, which was accessible only by steep, over-grown paths, or by boat. Tuke recorded the topography of this picturesque beach so faithfully in his paintings that it is usually possible to identify the exact rocks depicted.\n\n\n== Models ==\nFor this painting Henry Scott Tuke lists the following boys as his models:\n\nCharlie Mitchell: His boatman and regular model\nGeorge Williams: The younger son of close neighbours. He was then aged around fifteen\nMaurice Clift: The nephew of a family friend\nAinsley Marks\nDue to Tuke's habit of sometimes interchanging heads and bodies of his models in his paintings, it is difficult to identify each figure exactly. However, the central (horizontal) figure is known to be Maurice Clift.\n\n\n=== Charlie Mitchell and his pinkish shirt ===\n\nOf the models shown in the painting Gleaming waters, also the bare chested boy in the white pants, turning his back to the audience, and holding his pinkish shirt in his hands, can be identified. It is Charlie Mitchell (1885–1957), a boy from Falmouth. Henry Scott Tuke also captured this motif as an individual portrait in 1910, titled Preparing to bathe. Catherine Wallace points out: \"This dynamic oil of Tuke's boat-keeper, Charlie Mitchell, was painted in the summer of 1910 on Newporth beach, Falmouth. This study was for one of the main figures in Tuke's major painting, Gleaming waters.\" \nFurthermore, it exists a sketch, showing Charlie Mitchell in the same pose as in Gleaming waters and Preparing to bathe. The sketch bears a later added inscription on the back: Cornwall 1921, the year Tuke painted further similar portraits of Mitchell in Cornwall. Tuke repeated this motif in variations and in different techniques. There is a watercolour on paper, titled A bather on the rocks, signed and dated 1921, which shows Charlie Mitchell, lying bare chested on a rock, wearing the white pants, holding his pinkish shirt in his right hand, and looking over the sea.\nThe use of a distinct jarring colour note as the fulcrum of chromatic organisation, such as the red jersey in the painting Ruby, Gold and Malachite (1901) or the pinkish shirt in Gleaming waters, could be compared with the practice of artists such as James McNeill Whistler and Albert Joseph Moore.\nHenry Scott Tuke became fascinated and highly-skilled at painting the upper torso of the male nude. Charlie Mitchell was the inspiration for many of these paintings over the years. Frequently Tuke would paint him just wearing his white pants, emphasising the beauty of his back.\nThere was a lifelong friendship between Henry Scott Tuke and Charlie Mitchell. Mitchell served as a model for Tuke in many of his paintings. Mitchell looked after Tuke's boats for 30 years and also served as his rower when Tuke wanted to paint ships further out from Swanpool Bay. Tuke left Mitchell GBP1,000 in his will.\n\n\n== Perception – and the end of Tuke's eternal summer in Cornwall ==\nHenry Scott Tuke is recognised as a leading exponent of what is now termed British Impressionism. Within a few years, however, harsh reality had broken into this sundrenched idyll. All of Tuke's regular models were eventually called up during World War I, and some were never to return, including Maurice Clift, who is visible in Gleaming waters, and who died of his wounds in France.\n\n\"Henry Scott Tuke continued to produce bathing subjects until the end of his life, but was aware that by the 1920s these paintings were perceived as anachronistic and repetitious. The apparent carefree innocence of the Edwardian age was gone forever.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n in alphabetical order \n\nEmmanuel Cooper: The life and work of Henry Scott Tuke 1858–1929 – A Monographe, GMP Publishers Ltd., London, UK, 1987\nCicely Robinson: Henry Scott Tuke, Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2022\nDavid Wainwright & Catherine Dinn: Henry Scott Tuke, 1858–1929 – Under Canvas, Sarema Press, 1989\nCatherine Wallace: Henry Scott Tuke – Paintings from Cornwall, Halsgrove House, Wellington, UK, 2008\nCatherine Wallace: Catching the Light – The Art and Life of Henry Scott Tuke 1858–1929, Editor William Smith, Atelier Books, Edinburgh, UK, 2008",

        "content": "Florence Synodical Female College (predecessor, Florence Female Academy; 1854 - before 1900) was a 19th-century American girls' boarding school in Florence, Alabama. This was for many years one of the largest and most popular of the many colleges for girls in the South.\n\n\n== Establishment ==\nWhen the town of Florence was laid out, The Cypress Land Company gave two large lots in the center of the town for school buildings-one for boys and one for girls. On the one donated for a girls' school the citizens built a large, rather imposing structure surrounded by a board colonnade whose colonial columns were two stories high. In this building, the Synodical Female College commenced its existence in October 1854. It was chartered December 13, 1855; the bill was vetoed by Governor Winston, but passed by the constitutional majority.\nThe incorporators were William Mitchell, Robert M. Patton, James Irvine, Richard W. Walker, Sydney C. Posey, Neal Rowell, Thos. Kirkman, Samuel D. Weakly, Charles Gookin, Benjamin F. Foster, John S. Kennedy, William K. Key, Benjamin Taylor, Boyles E. Bourland, John T. Edgar, A. Smith, A. A. Doak, and R. B. McMillan. These trustees were empowered to hold real and personal property in trust in perpetuity for use of said college and for the Presbyterian Synod of Nashville, Tennessee, and all powers concerning property usually conferred upon trustees were granted to this board; also all legal title to property heretofore donated or conveyed to the Synod of Nashville by the president and trustees of the Florence Female Academy or by the mayor and aldermen of Florence, or by any others, was vested in the President and Trustees of Florence Synodical Female College. In addition, the power was given to confer diplomas upon graduating pupils, and to do all other necessary and proper things for the promotion of education in said college.\n\n\n== History ==\nThis was for many years one of the largest and most popular of the many colleges for girls in the South. At that time, the schools were all supplied with Northern teachers, there were no Southern teachers, except men; therefore, all the teachers in this school, except the president, were Northern women. When satisfactory, they were retained for years. There was always a large class in art, to whom everything in art of that day was taught. The pupils were drilled in spelling through the entire course, and were really taught to spell and to read.\nThe first president, Mr. Stebbin, was connected with the school for several years. He was followed by a Mr. Nicholls, who was a terror to the girls; is stay was short. The next president was Mr. Rogers from Georgia. He presided during the most prosperous years of the school. During this time every department was conducted by competent teachers. There was a German professor of music, Professor Neumayer, with competent assistants. The piano, violin, guitar, pipe organ, and harp were skilfully taught. The frequent musicals and concerts given in the chapel were enjoyed by large and appreciative audiences. Light operas were rendered, when the girls dressed in the required costumes. A native Frenchman, Monsieur De Soto, taught French, and creditable recitations were given, and compositions read in French, at the entertainments of the school, and these were frequent. The president of the board of trustees was Hon. Robert M. Patton, afterward Governor.\nDr. Rogers resigned the presidency on account of the ill health of his wife, and was succeeded by Dr. William N. Mitchell, who had been for many years the Presbyterian minister in Florence. The school was large and flourishing under his administration, until his health failed and he resigned. Mr. J. S. Anderson next took charge, and had a large school of girls from all over the South; however, he remained only a few years and resigned and bought property in Huntsville, Alabama and for many years had a large and flourishing school in that city. Mr. Frierson succeeded as president. The school did not prosper under his administration. His health failed and he remained only a short time. Dr. Bardwell then took charge. He was a Presbyterian minister, and very acceptable as a teacher and presiding officer, but his health failed and in a year or two he died. The trustees made a decided departure from the long established custom of electing a minister to preside over the school, and next elected Miss Sally Collier president.\nThe school continued during the American Civil War, as the invading armies did not enter that portion of the State.\nDuring the Reconstruction period the school began to decline; and the trustees, anxious to restore it to its pristine greatness, decided that an addition to the first building would be advantageous. They borrowed money to make the improvement, and thus encumbered the property with debt, which they were unable to liquidate.\nAfter the 1872 establishment of the State Normal in Florence (now part of the University of North Alabama), and the public school, the attendance at the Synodical College steadily decreased until it was thought advisable to close the doors forever. The last newspaper announcement regarding the institution's new school year occurred on September 3, 1896.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nElizabeth Augusta Russell (1832–1911), faculty member, Florence Synodical Female College; philanthropist, reformer, and restaurateur\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ali Imam (Bengali: আলী ইমাম; 12 April 1949 – 14 March 1989) was a former Bangladeshi football player and coach.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nAli Imam began his career as a left-winger at Dhaka Wanderers in 1963, under the guidance of his older brother Ali Hafiz. Nonetheless, Imam suffered continuous injuries throughout his career, keeping him out of action for the next two years. He represented Azad Sporting Club during both the 1966 and 1967 editions of the Aga Khan Gold Cup.\nDuring the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, Imam who moved to Calcutta and sought shelter in the Mohun Bagan clubhouse with the help of Balai Dey, was one of the main founders of the Shadhin Bangla football team. He also played for the team, touring throughout India to help fund the provisional Bangladesh government by handing over all the prize money they earned from 16 exhibition games played during their tour.\n\nIt was Ali Imam’s brain-child. He was trying to gather players but was struggling to form a team. He shared the idea with others, including Protap and Ashraf and some other people of different platforms. We had a trial before forming the team.\nOn 13 February 1972, Imam took part in the first football match in newly independent Bangladesh, representing the Bangladesh XI against the President's XI. His team was composed of former members of the Shadhin Bangla football team; nonetheless, they ended up losing 2–0. In 1972, In 1972, Imam joined Abahani Krira Chakra and contributed to organizing Abahani's first squad. He made his debut during the club's first league game against BJIC on 11 June 1972. He would win his first and only league title in 1974 with the same club.\n\n\n== Managerial career ==\nImam began training under-18 footballers at Kalabagan field in 1973. The training program saw Imam nurture future national team players such as Ahsanullah Montu, Shafiqul Islam Manik, Arif Abdul Khalek, Shafiul Arefin Tutul, AKM Abdul Baten, Kazi Kamal, AM Abdullah Saif, and Ataur Babu, among others. Imam began coaching in the First Division – Dhaka League with Shadharan Bima CSC in 1980 and helped the club finish sixth in the league; however, he made a name for himself as a coach by helping a then newly promoted Farashganj SC avoid relegation from the league in both 1981 and 1982.\nIn 1983, Imam was given the head coach duty of Abahani Krira Chakra and guided the club to consecutive Dhaka League titles in 1983 and 1984. His performances as Abahani coach saw him take charge of the Bangladesh national team for the 1984 South Asian Games held in Kathmandu, Nepal. The team finished as runners-up with only two weeks of training, recording 5–0 victories over  Maldives and hosts Nepal, before eventually losing 2–4 to Nepal in the final. At the club level, Imam was replaced as Abahani's head coach by the recently retired Kazi Salahuddin, denying him a chance to complete a hat-trick of league triumphs with the club.\nIn 1985, Imam joined Brothers Union, determined to take revenge. Brothers finished the first part of the season at the top of the table. Mohammedan was 2 points behind, while Abahani was 3 points further adrift. In the league-deciding game, Brothers led Abahani 2–0; however, the Sky Blues produced a memorable comeback to win 3–2. A goalles draw in the final match secured Abahani's third consecutive title as Imam's team finished runners-up. In 1986, Imam joined Mohammedan SC and finally got his revenge on Abahani, edging his former club to the league title. Mohammedan eventually defeated their arch-rivals 2–0 in the title-deciding Dhaka Derby match. In the same year, Imam coached Mohammedan during Nepal's Panchayat Silver Jubilee Cup, where Mohammedan played as the Bangladesh national team.\nIn 1987, Imam coached The Muslim Institute, based in Old Dhaka, in the Dhaka Second Division Football League. The following year, he returned to coaching in the First Division with Rahmatganj MFS. Imam coached both Old Dhaka clubs until his death in 1989.\n\n\n== Death ==\nImam, who suffered from heart disease, passed away on 14 March 1989 after experiencing a heart attack.\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\n\n=== Player ===\nAbahani Krira Chakra\n\nDhaka League: 1974\n\n\n=== Manager ===\nAbahani Krira Chakra\n\nDhaka League: 1983, 1984\nMohammedan SC\n\nDhaka League: 1986\nBangladesh\n\nSouth Asian Games Silver medal: 1984\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Bangladesh national football team managers\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDulal, Mahmud (2020).  খেলার মাঠে মুক্তিযুদ্ধ (transl. Liberation war in the playground) (in Bengali).

        "content": "Melfort Creek, originally known as Stoney Creek, is a river in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. It is in the aspen parkland ecozone and flows through the \"most productive farmland areas in Canada, the Carrot River Valley, a territory that has never known drought or severe crop failure\". The river begins at Eagle Lake and flows north where it meets the Carrot River in the Rural Municipality of Willow Creek No. 458. The Carrot River is a tributary of the Saskatchewan River within the Nelson River drainage basin. Along Melfort Creek's course are two reservoirs and the city of Melfort.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1892, the first European settlers arrived in the area and built a settlement called Stoney Creek on the banks of Stoney Creek. In 1902, the entire community (buildings and all) moved 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) to the north-west to meet the railway that was being built through the area. At that time, the community and river were renamed Melfort after Melfort estate in Argyllshire, Scotland, the birthplace of Mrs Reginald Beatty who was the first white woman settler in the area.\n\n\n== Course ==\nMelfort Creek begins at Eagle Lake in the Rural Municipality of Lake Lenore No. 399 and heads north towards the city of Melfort. South of Melfort, in the RM of Star City No. 428, Star City Dam was built creating Melfort PFRA Reservoir. Downstream from Star City Dam, and adjacent to the east side of Melfort, is the Melfort Town Reservoir. Part of the 3.6 km (2.2 mi) Melfort Kinsmen Centenary Trail follows Melfort Creek.\nMelfort Creek continues north from Melfort and meets the Carrot River in the RM of Willow Creek No. 458. Highway 6 follows the river's course for most of its length. Other highways that cross Melfort Creek include Highways 776, 3, and 778.\n\n\n== Star City Dam ==\nStar City Dam (52.8131°N 104.5696°W﻿ / 52.8131; -104.5696) was constructed on Melfort Creek upstream from the Melfort Town Reservoir. The 11.7-metre (38 ft) high dam was built by the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration (PFRA) in 1967. The reservoir behind the dam, named Melfort PFRA Reservoir, has a volume of 2,541 dam3 (2,060 acre⋅ft) and covers an area of 70 hectares (170 acres). It is owned and operated by the Saskatchewan Water Security Agency.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of rivers of Saskatchewan\nHudson Bay drainage basin\nSaskatchewan Water Security Agency\nList of dams and reservoirs in Canada\n\n\n== References ==",

He completed his studies at the Seminary of Granada but redirected his career to law. He obtained his law degree from the University of Granada, later entering the Public Administration.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nDeputy for Almería between 1857 and 1858.\nDeputy for Granada in various legislatures, between 1858 and 1868.\nSenator for the province of Granada in 1872.\nSenator for the province of Jaén between 1876 and 1877.\nSenator for the province of Granada in 1877, but opted for senator of the University of Granada.\nSenator for the Economic Society of Seville between 1879 and 1880. Also between 1881 and 1882.\n\n\n== Titles and positions ==\nChamberlain of Isabel II.\nKnight of 1st class of the Order of San Luis de Parma.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJosé Genaro was the son of Bernardino Onésimo Villanova López, a small farmer who worked the land inherited from his parents and other fields of the Marquis of Guadalcázar, under sharecropping. José Genaro was the second of eight siblings, which made it difficult for him to access any type of education. Thanks to the intervention and guardianship of the parish priest of Gójar, he was able to access the seminary of Granada.\nAfter completing his formation in the seminary, he entered the faculty of Law in Granada, subsequently practicing law in Granada and Almería upon obtaining his degree. During this period of practicing law, he expanded his studies at the San Indalecio college in Almería. Later, in the years 1847-48 and taking advantage of his stay in Barcelona as an employee of the Public Administration, he attended lectures on agriculture and botany.\nHe entered the Public Administration, where he had already worked since 1831 as an \"unpaid meritorious\" in the Accounting Office of Granada, starting a long career in the Ministry of Finance.\nLater he achieved the official category and salary corresponding to his class, rising according to his rank, holding:\nIn 1835, he was appointed official of the Accounting Office for Taxes and Levies on Amortizations of the province of Granada.\nIn 1837, he was transferred to Almería, with the same position. Parallelly, he was also appointed secretary of the board for the alienation of buildings and effects of the suppressed convents in the province of Almería by the disentailment of Mendizabal.\nIn 1868, he was appointed director general of accounting of the kingdom.\nAside from his administrative and political activity, he was vice president of the Artistic and Literary Lyceum of Almería, a member of the Academies of Natural Sciences and Arts of Barcelona, a member of the economic societies of Friends of the Country of Madrid and Barcelona, a member of the Sevillian Society for emulation and promotion of enlightenment, agriculture, arts, and commerce, a member of the board of directors of the Madrid Savings Bank. He was also a vocal member of the general board of agriculture held in Madrid in 1849.\nIn 1879, he acquired the Linares Bullring, always privately owned, a city where he already owned another business, such as the Gas Factory.\nHe was also the administrator of the House of Altamira. He took advantage of the disentailment of the Church to acquire lands in his native Gójar, in Gavia (where he built a large flour factory, still standing) and in La Zubia, adjacent to the lands of Gójar.\nHe supported and promoted the construction of the Linares mining railway, strongly backing the construction of the Jaén-Almería line.\nHe was a founder, along with Luis Seco de Lucena Escalada, of the liberal newspaper El Defensor de Granada, with José Genaro providing the financing and Seco de Lucena the technical direction.\nHe published numerous articles on administrative and economic matters. In the newspapers El Popular in 1847, Las Cortes in 1855, and El Diario Español in 1857 and 58, and in El Cultivador, the latter published in Barcelona by Jaume Llansó from 1848 to 1851.\n\n\n== Marriage and descendants ==\nJosé Genaro Villanova married twice: the first time in Almería in 1854 with Encarnación de Campos and in 1856, in Granada, with Dolores de la Cuadra Carrascosa, a wealthy heiress from Jaén. He had four children: his firstborn from his first marriage José Villanova de Campos, a civil engineer; and three more from the second: Luis, who was a mining engineer and married Princess Isabel Roma Rattazzi Bonaparte Wyse; Juan, who also became a senator; and Francisco, a lawyer from the University of Granada.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVillanova y Jiménez, José Genaro Biography on the website of the Congress of Deputies of Spain\nVillanova y Jiménez, José Genaro Biography on senado.es",

        "content": "Kitty Bluett (b. Brixton, 18 August 1916, d. Colchester, 27 July 1994) was an English-Australian actress and singer for radio, television and film. She played Ted Ray’s wife on the BBC radio show Ray's a Laugh from 1949 to 1961, the \"longest running husband-wife radio show ever\" with an estimated audience of 10 million. She appeared in several films, including A Son is Born (1946), alongside Ron Randell. She was the first female radio DJ in Australia.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nKitty Bluett was the third child of vaudevillian performer Fred Bluett and dressmaker Catherine (Katie) McKechnie. She had an older brother Augustus “Gus” Bluett, a comedian, and a sister, Belle. When Bluett was 10 weeks old her family moved to Australia. She attended school in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, as her family moved around performing.\n\n\n=== Relationships ===\nShe married musician Walter \"Wally\" Robert Zepp Portingale at St John’s Church, Darlinghurst, in June 1941. Portingale was a member of Jim Gerald’s entertainment unit for the A.I.F.. They divorced in 1947, with Bluett saying he \"objected to her following her profession soon after their marriage\". The following year she moved back to England and became a household name as a radio actor in Ray’s a Laugh. She dated actor Ron Randell for six years. They planned to marry but he moved to Hollywood and married actress Elaine Diana Maltzman instead. Randell’s marriage to Maltzman did not last, and a year later Randell and Bluett reconciled and once again planned to marry. However Randell got engaged to Amanda Blake and shortly afterwards Bluett got engaged to circus performer Mickey Ashton, although they never married.\nAs a radio star, Bluett’s personal life was frequently reported in the news, to the point that in 1950 she said \"My romances have become like a tennis match for the public. First their heads turn one way, then another as I try and make up my mind. It can have a very damaging effect on an artist.\" Bluett made headlines in 1954 when it was reported that her mother was a \"romance breaker\" which Bluett denied.\nIn 1955, Bluett married Julian Jover (1926-2014), an acrobat and variety performer. They met while performing on the same bill at the Birmingham Hippodrome. They had a daughter, Jody, born in 1958. They moved to Australia in 1963, where Jover became a successful children’s TV producer. They divorced in 1980.  Bluett returned to England in 1985 and died in Colchester.\n\n\n=== Interests ===\nBluett was a \"champion horsewoman\" in jumping and cross-country. She received her first pony as a gift in 1936 from her brother Gus. In 1951 she said that her ambition was to \"have a sort of ranch and breed horses in Bowral.\" When she was living in London she would go horse riding in Rotten Row. Bluett was also \"champion swimmer\" over 100 and 440 yards, swimming as a pacemaker for visiting Australian swimming teams.\n\n\n== Australia career (1916-1948) ==\nBluett first appeared on stage aged two-and-a-half in her father’s vaudeville act at the Sydney Tivoli theatre, where she played \"Boy Scout No. 5\". As a child, she learnt tap dancing, ballet, singing and impersonation. When she was 12 she began doing impressions of Greta Garbo and ZaSu Pitts. She performed as part of her father’s act for 15 years. Between 1940 and 1948, Bluett appeared on the Australian stage and screen. For the radio she was a Colgate-Palmolive radio artist where her professional partner was Dick Bentley.\nShe appeared on the front cover of Radio Pictorial of Australia magazine in April 1940 and the front cover of The ABC Weekly in November 1940. A 1941 newspaper article called her \"possibly the leading comedienne in Australia to-day.\"\n\n\n=== Film ===\n1934: Cinesound Varieties Dir. Ken G. Hall\n1942: A Yank in Australia Dir. Alfred J. Goulding\n1946: A Son is Born Dir. Eric Porter with Ron Randell, Peter Finch and John McCallum\n1949: What a Carry On! with Jimmy Jewel. Dir. John E. Blakeley\n\n\n=== Radio ===\n1937: A Cockney Cameo with Fred Bluett\n1940: Dr Davey, the Happiest Man on Earth Jack Davey’s Sunday night show\n1940: Mirthquake\n1941: Out of the Bag with Dick Bentley and Joy Nichols\n1941: Bachelor Mother for 2GB Radio Theatre\n1941: Melody Riddles with Harry Dearth\n1941: Black Velvet at the Tivoli\n1941: The Cowboy and the Lady with Eric Bush and Pat Kennedy\n1942: Dithering with Davey with Jack Davey and Betty Bryant\nEarly 1940s: Rhythm Inn with Don Baker\n1949: Meet the Girl Friend with John Bushelle\nIn 1942 Bluett made front page news for a \"risqué\" on-air joke she made about \"flimsy nightdresses\" which led to the threat of her being removed from broadcasting. The Chief Radio Inspector had received complaints from the Good Film and Radio Vigilance League among others, and required Bluett to satisfactorily explain the joke, which she had made on Ladies First, compered by Jack Davey. The case was dropped within weeks. Of the incident, Bluett was reported as saying, \"I think it’s silly. If people are going to think that way and see double meanings, they shouldn’t listen.\"\n\n\n=== Live performance ===\nBluett would often play the role of soubrette (a ‘saucy or flirtatious young woman’) in theatre productions.\n\n1933: No, No, Nanette, Over She Goes and Swinging Along Dir. George Gee\n1936: The Jesters with her father, Fred Bluett\n1937: J. C. Williamson’s corps de ballet - she became a soloist in 1938\n1938: No, No Nanette in Melbourne\n1939: Singer at Romano’s restaurant, Sydney\n1940: Singer at Century Theatre, Sydney with Desmond Tanner\n1941: Funny Side Up at Theatre Royal, Brisbane with Dick Bentley\n1941 Funny Side Frolics at His Majesty’s Theatre, Melbourne\n1942: Point Valaine by Noël Coward at Minerva Theatre, Sydney\n1943: Janie Dir. Alec Coppel at Minerva Theatre, Sydney\n1944: The Patsy at Theatre Royal, Sydney\n1949: Ice Vogues at The Stoll Dir. Tom Arnold\n\n\n=== War service ===\nBetween 1943 and 1944, Bluett, together with Gladys Moncrieff, Bebe Scott and Flo Patonhe, were the first women to travel to New Guinea to entertain the Australian troops. While she was there, the American Marines made her an honorary Lieutenant.\nIn 1945 she appeared in Calling the Stars show, in support of the Fourth Victory Loan.\nIn 1952 she performed for R.A.A.F. Fighter Wing 78, based in Malta on garrison duties post-WWII. She also entertained troops stationed in Tripoli, Cyrenaica and the Suez Canal zone.\n\n\n=== Hollywood ===\nIn March 1947 Bluett travelled to America for six months. Her final appearance in Australia before she left was at a variety show in aid of the Miss Australia Quest in Sydney Town Hall. Before leaving for the States she told an interviewer, \"I feel completely frustrated in Australian radio. For some time, I have been relegated to straight roles. That’s not good for a comedienne.\"\nAlthough the trip was ostensibly a holiday, while she was in the States, Bluett appeared in the following:\n\nA show with Jack Benny\nVacation from Marriage (Perfect Strangers), a play with Van Heflin and Valerie Hobson\nTwo episodes of Cecil B. DeMille’s Lux Radio Theatre\nA serial with Henry Fonda\nA play with Lana Turner and John Garfield\nShe also met Ginger Rogers, Esther Williams and Maureen O'Hara. She returned to Australia in September, \"a bit disillusioned with Hollywood\", but still returned to New York in 1948 to appear in a play.\n\n\n== England (1949-1963) ==\nBluett arrived in England on 1 January 1949 for a six-month holiday to visit her sister Belle, and to replace Belle in her brother-in-law Jimmy Jewel’s act for a short time. Bluett’s intention was then to carry on to America. However, Dick Bentley had sent her details to the BBC while she was en route to England, and, within a week of arriving, she had signed a contract to appear in Ray’s a Laugh. Before recording started, she squeezed in appearances in a number of shows including Caribbean Rhapsody, Variety Bandbox and Henry Hall’s Guest Night.\nWhile living in London, Bluett mixed with the stars of the day. In 1951, while in Paris, Humphrey Bogart and Hoagy Carmichael cut off a foot of her hair to create a \"chop cut\".\n\n\n=== Ray’s a Laugh (1949-1961) ===\nBluett played the long-running role of Ted Ray’s wife, Kitty, a \"resigned and intelligent spouse\" on BBC radio show Ray’s a Laugh from 1949 to 1961. She played the role \"for so long that listeners believed Ray was married to Kitty\" in real life.\nShe appeared in all but one of the eleven series. In March 1950 Bluett was offered a role in a separate musical comedy at a \"princely salary\" but turned it down saying, \"it would not be fair on the rest of the cast [of Ray’s a Laugh] to leave so suddenly.\" One London newspaper columnist called this \"one of the most unselfish actions this column has ever had the pleasure of recording.\" Bluett was promoted to Ray’s co-star in 1952. In 1954 the Sydney Daily Telegraph reported that, on the strength of her acting in Ray’s a Laugh, \"the BBC… feels that Kitty Bluett will turn into a \"British Lucille Ball.\"\n\n\n=== All My Eye and Kitty Bluett (1951) ===\nIn 1955, a spin-off show, All My Eye and Kitty Bluett, was created specifically as a vehicle for her talents. It first aired on 7 June 1955.  The cast of All My Eye… included Stanley Baxter, Terry Scott and Patricia Hayes, and the script writers were Terry Nation and Dick Barry. The show was dropped after one series – called \"a disaster\" by Nation’s biographer Jonathan Bignell – and Bluett returned to Ray’s a Laugh for series seven.\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\n1949: Charity show at the London Palladium, also featuring Judy Garland and Danny Kaye\n1950: Bluett appeared in various music halls around London\n1951: Royal Show at the Windsor Castle Christmas party alongside Peter Sellers, Tony Hancock, Peter Madden and Hattie Jacques\n1953: An American Comic and Seventy Women charity revue with Jackie Mason. Other guests including Vera Lynn, Betty Driver and Anne Shelton\n1953: Joy Bells with Bunny Doyle at New Royal Theatre, Bournemouth\n1954: Royal Command Performance alongside Bob Hope and Laurence Olivier\n1954: Oliver! at The Vic\nBluett also held regular charity concerts in aid of the police force.\n\n\n=== TV ===\nBluett did not appear frequently on television. In a 1951 interview she said, \"I don’t like television very much. I don’t like watching it. Rehearsals are very tedious. I find it confusing and unsatisfactory. It’s neither one thing nor the other.\" She did however appear on the following TV programmes:\n\n1955: This Is Your Life dedicated to Ted Ray, as a guest\n1957: It Pays to be Ignorant BBC One with Michael Bentine and Harold Berens\n1961: The Cheaters ITV\n1963: The Delo and Daly Show\n\n\n=== Other radio ===\nBluett became a BBC Radio DJ in 1951. About her role she said, \"I’ll pick my own records – swing, orchestral and so on – and there’ll be plenty of quiet string music for elderly people. I think too many record programme arrangers forget all about them.\" Her radio appearances included:\n\n1949: Show Parade with Bob Monkhouse and Terry Scott\n1950: You Ain’t Heard Nothing Yet with Bob Dyer\n1951: First Person Plural with Lloyd Berrell\n1951: Radio Command Performance with Frankie Howerd and Ted Ray\n1951: Variety Bandbox as part of the Festival of Britain\n1951: Hello Australia as part of Australia Day\n1953: British National Radio Show at Earls Court, alongside fellow Australians Shirley Abicair and Anona Winn\n1953: It’s Not Cricket with Bill Kerr.

Writer: David Climie\n1955: Ladder to Fame co-compere with Kenneth Horne, it was \"a show for Australians – about Australians – and the success they are enjoying overseas!\"\n1958: Saturday Night on the Light guest\n\n\n== Return to Australia (1963-1985) ==\nBluett returned to Australia with her husband and daughter in 1963. An article in The Australian Women's Weekly that year described Bluett as \"a stalwart in any comedy sketch who can play straight \"man\" or comedienne at will.\" Her Australian performances included:\n\n1963: Cat on a Hot Tin Roof at Emerald Hill Theatre, Melbourne\n1963: The Delo and Daly Show Channel HSV7\n1965: Away From it All radio guest\n\n\n== Music ==\nBluett is credited on the following recordings:\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nDearie (1950) with Ted Ray\nYou Can Count on Me with Ted Ray (1950)\nIf I Knew You Were Comin' I'd've Baked a Cake with Bill Kerr (1950)\nLet’s Put Out the Lights with Ted Ray (1951)\nEasy Come, Easy Go/What a Cute Little Hat (1951)\nSix Times a Week and Twice on Sunday (1951)\nGo to Sleep, Go to Sleep, Go to Sleep (1951)\nTelephone Song (1951)\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nThe Best of Mo with Roy Rene (\"Mo\") LP\nMemories of Mo with Roy Rene (1985) LP\nShe also performed with Ted Heath’s Band as a guest vocalist.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nFoster, A.

        "content": "Ahmad Manasra is a 22-year-old Palestinian who was arrested in 2015 at the age of 13 in relation to the Pisgat Ze'ev stabbings in an Israeli settlement in East Jerusalem.\nDespite not being found to have participated in stabbings, he was convicted of attempted murder and imprisoned. During his imprisonment, he has endured severe violations of his rights, harsh treatment, and prolonged solitary confinement, significantly impacting his mental health to the extent of it being considered a risk to his life. Israeli authorities have nevertheless repeatedly extended his solitary confinement.\nManasra's case has drawn strong international condemnation from the UN, human rights groups, and mental health organizations who have urged Israel to release him, raising concerns about the violations of international laws prohibiting torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment in this case.\n\n\n== Arrest and imprisonment ==\nManasra was arrested in 2015 at the age of 13 in relation to the Pisgat Ze'ev stabbings, which involved the stabbing and injury of two people in an Israeli settlement in East Jerusalem. \nDespite being found not to have participated in the stabbings, he was convicted of attempted murder in 2016 and sentenced to prison.\nDuring his time in prison, Manasra has been subjected to serious violations of his rights, including being interrogated without the presence of his lawyer or parent, enduring insults, threats, and harsh treatment. \nHe has also suffered from solitary confinement, which has significantly impacted his mental health, leading to diagnoses of schizophrenia, psychosis, severe depression, and suicidal thoughts.\nDespite his deteriorating condition, the Israeli authorities have repeatedly extended his solitary confinement, disregarding the warnings of independent psychiatrists about the risks to his life.\nManasra's treatment in prison has been characterized by inhumane conditions, prolonged isolation, and a lack of proper medical care, raising concerns about violations of international law regarding torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.\n\n\n== International response ==\nThe international response to the case of Manasra has been marked by strong condemnation and calls for his immediate release. Human rights experts and organizations, including the UN, as well as numerous mental health groups, have urged Israel to free Manasra due to the serious violations of his rights and the inhumane treatment he has endured.\nUN human rights experts have criticized Israel for Ahmad's detention, highlighting that it violates international humanitarian law and that his imprisonment has deprived him of his childhood and essential rights.They emphasized the urgent need for Ahmad to receive necessary mental health care and counseling, especially considering his deteriorating condition.\nThe UK-Palestine Mental Health Network, USA-Palestine Mental Health Network, France-Palestine Mental Health Network, Ireland-Palestine Mental Health Network, and South Africa-Palestine Mental Health Network have all advocated for his immediate release.\nAmnesty International has condemned the solitary confinement of Manasra as a violation of the absolute prohibition on torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.\nAmnesty's reports have also highlighted Manasra's case as part of a broader pattern of discrimination against Palestinian children in the Israeli criminal justice system, underscoring the need for fair trials and an end to ill-treatment.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Generations is an album by the American musician Steve Wilson, released in 1998. The album title refers to Wilson's desire to record with  different generations of jazz musicians. It was his first album for Chick Corea's Stretch Records; Wilson had been a member of Corea's Origin band. Wilson supported the album with a North American tour.\n\n\n== Production ==\nWilson was backed by drummer Ben Riley, pianist Mulgrew Miller, and bassist Ray Drummond. He chose the musicians due in part to the subtlety of their playing. Wilson wrote five of the album's songs. \"Chelsea Bridge\" is a version of the Billy Strayhorn composition.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nEntertainment Weekly wrote that \"a cooking backing unit nudged along by the great drummer Ben Riley keeps Wilson on his toes.\" The New York Times determined that, \"with a light but commanding sound, he plays lines that sound fresh and airily bluesy, unencumbered by the too-common will to overwhelm\"; the paper's Peter Watrous listed the album as the 10th best of 1998. The Washington Post noted that \"A Joyful Noise\" is \"a splendid showcase for Wilson's lithe soprano sax and a tune that exudes an insinuating charm even before Miller leisurely and elegantly expands upon the theme.\"\nThe Chicago Tribune concluded that \"the distinctively keening quality of his tone, inventiveness of his melody lines and high quality of his compositions ... point to an artist of considerable accomplishment and promise.\" The Richmond Times-Dispatch said that \"the saxophonist's technically fluent, crisply lyrical style sets the tone in a varied set.\" The Toronto Star stated that \"Wilson's fluent style fits myriad moods and the musicianship level is high.\"\nAllMusic wrote that Wilson's \"mesmerizing soprano sax on 'A Joyful Noise', his spirited flute on the lovely 'Trapaceria', and strong alto sax on his intense 'Sisko' all [merit] strong praise.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Lora Dimitrova (Bulgarian: Лора Димитрова, born 9 September 1962) is a Bulgarian classical pianist, teacher and leader in music education. She lives in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n== Early life in Bulgaria ==\nDimitrova was born on 9 September 1962 in Sofia, Bulgaria. She received her early musical training at the \"Lyubomir Pipkov\" National Music School in Sofia in the piano class of Milena Kurteva.: pp. 63–64  From 1981 to 1987 she attended the \"Pancho Vladigerov\" National Academy of Music in Sofia where she studied with Julia and Konstantin Ganevi,: p. 3  pupils of the celebrated pedagogue, Heinrich Neuhaus. She was thus immersed in this Russian School of piano playing for the 20 formative years of her piano education. : 37, 52 \nDimitrova graduated with honours from the four-year performance diploma course in 1985 and was one of the two students selected to take the two-year advanced masterclass diploma (premier prix) which she gained in 1987. : inside cover  Lora was also appointed part-time assistant to the Ganevi's piano class in the Academy in 1985, teaching both undergraduate and post-graduate students while studying for her advanced diploma – a position she held until she left the country. : p. 3 \nNotable debut performances during this time include: p. 3 \n\n1979: debut with the National Academy of Music Orchestra in Bulgaria State Hall, Sofia, playing Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto\n1982: debut recital at the Bulgarian Contemporary Music Festival in Sofia\n1984: debut with the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra in Leipzig, Germany, playing Mozart's D minor piano concerto\n1986: debut recital in the Grand Hall of Moscow Conservatory\nAt this time, Bulgaria was part of the Eastern Bloc under Soviet control and apart from travel to compete (Senigallia, Italy; Leeds International Piano Competition, UK; Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, USA; International Music Competition \"Maria Callas\" Piano, Greece), Dimitrova was unable to perform in the West or have access to Western recordings.\nHowever, following success at the Maria Callas competition and subsequent auditions, she received an offer with scholarships to study at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London (UK). After many challenges, she finally obtained the precious Bulgarian visa at the end of 1988 to study in the West. : pp. 12–13 \n\n\n== Solo performing career in the West ==\nDimitrova studied in the advanced piano class at Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London in 1989/1990 and was awarded the Sherrifs' prize for Performance and the Premier Prix diploma. : p. 3  While studying there she entered the YCAT (then Young Concert Artists Trust, now Young Classical Artists Trust) competition for management and promotion and was chosen as one of their artists in 1989 and thus began a busy performing schedule in the UK and Europe.: p. 3 \nIn 1993, Dimitrova had a chance encounter with the conductor Sir Georg Solti. She had received a phone call asking if she could accompany a singer who was auditioning for Solti but whose pianist had failed to show up. \"It was complete sight-reading\" said Dimitrova. \"I was given the music – songs by Vaughan Williams – 15 minutes before going into Sir Georg's studio. I had never met the singer, let alone played with him.\" Solti said \"the singer wasn't anything very much, so I began listening to how well the pianist was playing.\" The result was a joint recital at Wigmore Hall in London for Dimitrova and French pianist Patricia Pagny which Solti personally sponsored, promoted and presented. Dimitrova went on to perform Bartok's third piano concerto with Solti and the London Symphony Orchestra to critical acclaim in festivals in Dresden and Salzburg. Solti also nominated Dimitrova for the Chimay International Competition for Pianists and Violinists in 1995 (European Chimay Foundation) which she won, leading to further recitals in Europe. : pp. 49–50 \n\nDimitrova is a Steinway Artist. Notable debut concerts in her career include:\n\n1989: Barbican Centre main hall (London) debut with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Per Dreier (Rachmaninov's 2nd Piano Concerto)\n1990: Purcell Room (London) debut solo recital\n1991: Fairfield Halls (London) debut solo recital\n1991: Malvern Festival debut with the English String Orchestra conducted by William Boughton (Shostakovich 2nd Piano Concerto)\n1993: Royal Festival Hall (London) debut with the London Concert Orchestra conducted by Fraser Goulding (Grieg Piano Concerto)\n1995: Wigmore Hall joint recital with Patricia Pagny, arranged and presented by Sir Georg Solti\n1995: Palace of Fine Arts, Brussels debut with the Belgian National Orchestra conducted by Dmitry Yablonsky (Rachmaninov's 2nd Piano Concerto)\n1996: Monaco debut – recital in the Spring Arts Festival\n1996: Dresden Music Festival and Salzburg Whitsun Festival debuts with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sir Georg Solti (Bartok 3rd Piano Concerto)\n\n\n== Chamber music ==\nIn 1995, Dimitrova won the Parkhouse Award for Chamber Music, playing with the violinist Hanna Weinmeister. This award provided concert management for the duo by GBZ Management and resulted in many chamber recitals in London and around the UK. The duo also played in Germany, Switzerland and Austria.: p. 50 \nDimitrova has performed in chamber music concerts with numerous violinists and ensembles, including:\n\nHanna Weinmeister (violin)\nPriya Mitchell (violin)\nSian Phillips (musician) (violin)\nBen Hancox (violin)\nChloe Hanslip (violin)\nNavarra String Quartet\nKandinski Trio\nMaggini String Quartet\nLeon Bosch (double bass)\n\n\n== Contemporary music ==\nDimitrova has championed contemporary music throughout her career and given several world premiers of important works for solo piano by Bulgarian, English and Belgium composers. : pp. 36–37 \nIn Bulgaria, Dimitrova performed regularly at the Bulgarian Contemporary Music Festival in Sofia, : p. 3  often premiering work by her contemporaries and she continued to champion Bulgarian music in the UK, for example performing works by Emil Mirchev and Pancho Vladigerov at the Brighton Festival in 1990.\nFollowing her first prize in the Chimay International Competition for Pianists and Violinists in 1995 (European Chimay Foundation, ECF), Dimitrova teamed up with the Belgian composer Frederic Van Rossum performing a number of his works in concerts including at the 1996 Festival of Flanders and giving the world premiere of \"Al di la dello scuro\" (beyond the dark) on 28 September 1996 in Liege, Belgium. : pp. 49–50 \nDimitrova has often performed the work of English composer Francis Routh and he wrote his 8 movement piano piece, Scenes for Piano IV \"Bretagne\" (Op.68) for her. She recorded this work for the Redcliffe Recordings label as well as Routh's Angels of Albion (Op 64) and performed it on a tour of England with Routh in 1999.\n\n\n== Arranging and Quattro Piano Plus ==\nIn the early 2000's Lora created a unique group of musicians known as \"Quattro Piano Plus\", consisting of 4 pianists (performing at 4 separate pianos) plus a percussionist. They perform arrangements of popular music from the classical repertoire as well as from films and musicals, often combining multiple genres, rhythms and melodies into a single piece: Dimitrova leads the group and writes the majority of the arrangements.\nThe Quattro Piano+ group puts on popular shows with video and lighting effects and the group has toured extensively in Europe, most recently in autumn 2023 in Bulgaria with backing provided by the Vidin Philharmonic Orchestra. The group has released 2 CDs (on the \"Hey-U Records\" and \"Newplay Classical Recordings\" labels). : channel description \n\n\n== Teaching and leadership positions ==\nIn addition to performing, Dimitrova has taught, delivered master classes and lectures and adjudicated for music competitions. Towards the end of the 1990's, with her playing career being hampered by injury, Dimitrova spent increasingly more of her time on these activities. She has taught and given masterclasses at Guildhall School of Music and Drama, Chetham's School of Music, the Yehudi Menuhin School, Purcell School, Wells Cathedral School, Blackheath Conservatoire and KIPC (Kent International Piano Courses). She has also lectured at Queen's University Belfast and Andover College (Hampshire) and given master classes in France, Germany, Spain and Switzerland.\nDimitrova created the curriculum for a Performance and Interpretation course for BMus and MMus students in Canterbury Christ Church University and delivered the course from 1998 to 2008. : p. 51 \nShe also set up her own small private piano school called the Sospiro Piano Centre in Biggin Hill, Kent, UK, with 6 staff and 100 students which ran from 2000 to 2013.\nIn 2009, Dimitrova was appointed head of keyboard for Bromley Youth Music Trust (BYMT), an independent music service providing musical education to young people in the London Borough of Bromley and surrounding areas. At that time, the keyboard department at BYMT was tiny and almost inactive but she developed the role to be full time and built the department into a large, thriving one.\nShe recruited, managed, motivated and inspired skilled staff (building up to 60 teachers and 30 accompanists), reached out to more than 100 schools and engaged more than 1,700 piano students. Dimitrova continued as Head of Keyboard at BYMT until 2023. During her time there she created many regular termly courses, classes and concerts, including ones for students and adults as well as children. She created BYMT's first piano library and piano alumni database. She also created the annual Summer International Piano School for all ages and organised numerous events, such as recordings and trips to museums, concerts and masterclasses.\nDuring Dimitrova's expansion and invigoration of the Keyboard Department at BYMT, she was asked to create, promote and head up a Jazz department. She recruited a team of specialist jazz musicians and set up BYMT's first jazz school, led by Buster Birch. As well as organising jazz events at the music centre at BYMT, she reached out to Pizza Express Head Office and organised jazz events in their Bromley and Beckenham branches, featuring BYMT students and professional musicians.\nDimitrova also helped organise jazz performance opportunities at local events and worked closely with Buster Birch and Trinity College of Music's Jazz Department to raise awareness of Jazz education and help develop the BYMT Jazz School. Dimitrova was presented with the Will Michael Foundation Jazz Education Award in both 2015 and 2017 – this was awarded to Bromley in recognition of an outstanding commitment to jazz education. She continued as head of Jazz until 2022.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

Named after the Sea of Azov, the ship was built in Poland and launched in 1989.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Russian invasion of Ukraine ===\nIn 2021, it was reported that Azov was a part of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, stationed in Crimea, participating in amphibious warfare training. In June 2022, Azov was among the Black Sea Fleet vessels reported to be operational and available for amphibious landings in the Black Sea by Russian sources.\nOn 24 March 2024, the Ukrainian general staff and open-source intelligence sources reported that Azov and her sister ship Yamal were hit by cruise missiles while they were in their home port of Sevastopol. Eyewitnesses reported explosions during the night. The recent satellite images did not reveal any damage, showing that the missile hit the pier next to the ship presumably due to the electronic warfare system. \n\n\n== References ==",

[talk] 19:48, 6 April 2024 (UTC)\n\n\"Härlig Är Vår Jord\" is a Swedish pop song by Anni-Frid Lyngstad from 1969 written and conducted by Ivan Renliden. Lyngstad performed it in Melodifestivalen 1969 where it finished in fifth place with eight points.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn Autumn 1968, Lyngstad had been selected for Melodifestivalen 1969 alongside 9 other artists. The artists then received an open-entry of compositions, which Lyngstad received Relinden's composition by December 1968. By the time of the composition deadline on 1st February 1969, Lyngstad had 200 entries, which she reduced down to 31, but Lyngstad ultimately chose \"Härlig Är Vår Jord\" which had had a high opinion of, hoping it would do well.\nLyngstad recorded \"Härlig Är Vår Jord\" in the EMI Studios, Stockholm in two takes, on 21st December 1968 alongside schlager song, \"Räkna De Lyckliga Stunderna Blott\" with Ivan Renlidens Orkester.\n\n\n== Melodifestivalen ==\nMelodifestivalen 1969 was held on 1st March 1969 at Cirkus, Stockholm and had 99 people in the jury. She had met her future husband Benny Andersson at this event, who had co-written Jan Malmsjö's song.  Both would recall that after the broadcast they had exchanged a quick hello backstage, no more than that. Backed by three singers, Lyngstad had difficulties rehearsing the song, but the performed had been well prepared by the time the show started. The event was broadcast on TV, although only audio footage survives. Lyngstad wore an orange tunic and was the penultimate performance. \"Härlig Är Vår Jord\" had been placed joint fourth with 8 points.  The following day, Dagens Nyheter reported \"A beautiful woman, a beautiful song. Being as new to this sort of thing as Anni-Frid Lyngstad is, she did unusually well with this bossa nova, which was charming without lacking character, pleasant without being boring, but unfortunately the song didn't remain in my memory for very long despite its neat arrangement.\"\nAfter the contest, Lyngstad had returned to perform in the Charlie Norman Show, which ran from January to May. On 4th March, a few days after the contest, The Hep Stars attended an after-show of the Charlie Norman Show with Lyngstad, for dinner, including Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus. Within a month, Lyngstad and Andersson became a couple. Despite Lyngstad's unsuccessful attempt and Andersson's composition ultimately being the runner up, they had won Melodifestivalen and Eurovision in 1974 with Waterloo as ABBA.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe first single had been withdrawn as \"Räkna De Lyckliga Stunderna Blott\" had been mistakingly pressed the A-side and \"Härlig Är Vår Jord\" on the B-side issued in a company sleeve. Both songs on this pressing were alternative versions. The single was rectified and released on 3rd March with a picture sleeve, a new catalogue number and 1,000 copies were pressed. Lyngstad and Ollie Bergman went to West Germany to pursue the possibility of marketing a German version of \"Härlig Är Vår Jord\" but nothing came of this. \"Härlig Är Vår Jord\" spent one week at the Svensktoppen at #8 on 24th April 1969. This marked the first time Lyngstad appeared on the Svensktoppen as her previous singles failed to do so, only appearing in the Toppentipset. Lyngstad would not appear again until the following year with \"Där Du Går Lämnar Kärleken Spår\".\n\n\n== Covers ==\nIvan Renliden recorded the song in 1976 for his album Ivan Renliden Spelar Ivan Renliden.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMelodifestivalen 1969\n\n\n== References ==",

The holiday was created in 1919 when the Uruguay state formerly created separation from the Catholic Church.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe creation of Tourism Week was formerly designated on 23 of October 1919, as part of the formal separation from the Catholic Church created in Ley N° 6997. The law modified liturgical holidays as secular holidays with official designations for celebration in Uruguay, including other holidays such as the Day of the Kings (January 6) which was designated the Day of the Children, and Christmas which was designated as the Day of the Family.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nTourism week is an important holiday for different kinds of festivals and celebrations in Uruguay, such as the annual bike race Vuelta Ciclista del Uruguay, Criollo week in Rural Prado, Rural del Prado, the week of Beer in Paysandú, and others.\nThe week also includes a bank holiday for Thursday and Friday, with most businesses not working in the Tourism sector also providing the days off.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPor qué Semana de Turismo y no Semana Santa (en uruguaytotal.com)\nSemana de Turismo (en sociedaduruguaya.org)\nLa laicidad uruguaya, por Néstor da Costa",

Opened in late 2023, it is owned and operated by the local municipality.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe museum is located in the Ulus St. of Akçakaya neighborhood in Midyat district of Mardin Province, southeastern Turkey. It \nis situated in a 1850-built house of Assyrian Gelle Hirmız family, which was donated to the Municipality of Midyat. The museum was established by the local municipality, and opened to the public on 10 December 2023.\nIn the museum, handcrafted silver filigree artwork from the Roman Empire, Byzantine Empire, ottoman Empire periods and the Republican era are on display.\nThere is a workshop inside the museum, where visitors can observe the silversmithing, and also participate in handcrafting.\nThe museum offers filigree artwork for sale to the visitors.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe art of silversmithing in the region goes back to around three millemium B.C. The thousands of years old artwork in the museum are examples from Anatolia and Mesopotamia. Silverware was used in the history as kitchen items due to its anti bacterial property, and also as decorative items. Silver was used during the Roman period to prevent water in ornamental pools from gathering algae. The art of filigree is the hand embroidery of Assyrian masters from Midyat, shaped by the master-apprentice relationship throughout history.\n\n\n== Filigree artwork ==\nThe silver wires used for handcrafted filigree artwork are melted at 950 °C (1,740 °F),  and thinned by reducing the diameter  to 0.022 mm (0.00087 in).\nFiligree masters from Midyat handcraft bracelets, necklaces, earrings, rings, belts, rosaries, keychains, objects containing religious symbols, kitchen objects, jewelry and ornaments decorated in different ways designed with plant patterns and geometric symbols using traditional techniques with great mastery.\n\n\n== References ==",

The South Dakota primary was a closed primary, with the state awarding 22 delegates to the 2000 Republican National Convention, of whom all 22 were pledged delegates allocated on the basis of the primary results.\nTexas governor and presumptive nominee George W. Bush won the primary with roughly 79% of the vote and won 22 delegates, helping him solidify his presumptive nomination over John McCain, who had suspended his campaign three months earlier. McCain garnered 14% of the vote, while Alan Keyes received roughly 8%. Minor candidate James Attia received under 1% of the vote.\n\n\n== Procedure ==\nSouth Dakota was one of five states that voted on June 6, 2000, in the Republican primaries, along with Alabama, Montana, New Jersey, and New Mexico.\nVoting took place throughout the state from 8 a.m. until 8 p.m. In the closed primary, candidates had to meet a threshold of 20% at the congressional district or statewide level in order to be considered viable. The 22 pledged delegates to the 2000 Republican National Convention were allocated proportionally on the basis of the primary results. Of these, 1 was allocated to the state's lone congressional district and another 6 were allocated on an at-large basis, in addition to 13 bonus delegates.\n\n\n== Candidates ==\nThe following candidates appeared on the ballot:\nRunning\n\nGeorge W.

        "content": "Fairbanks Morse Defense was a supplier of marine technologies, engines, details, etc. for U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, Military Sealift Command, and Canadian Coast Guard working since 1823.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1823, Thaddeus Fairbanks founded an ironworks in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, where he began manufacturing two of his inventions: a cast iron plow and a heating stove. By 1829, he had expanded into the hemp dressing industry, creating machinery for the venture, though it did not find success in fiber factory production. However, another invention by Morse, the platform scale, patented in June 1832, became the cornerstone for what would later evolve into Fairbanks Morse and Company. This innovation, along with his brother Erastus Fairbanks, propelled E. & T. Fairbanks & Company to sell thousands of scales across the United States and later globally in Europe, South America, and Imperial China. Over the years, the company's scales earned 63 medals in international competitions, marking significant achievements. The products of Fairbanks Morse were often illustrated and described in Popular Mechanics, Time and other magazines.\nFairbanks Morse Defense, a subsidiary of Arcline Investment Management, was established following the acquisition of Fairbanks Morse Engine from EnPro Industries on January 21, 2020.  Fairbanks Morse Defense started with expansion into the defense sector, leveraging the legacy and expertise of its past in engine manufacturing.\nIn 2021, the company acquired Ward Leonard,  Welin Lambie,  and Hunt Valve, thus creating the Fairbanks Morse Defense family of brands. The expansion continued in 2022 with the addition of Federal Equipment Company, Maxim Watermakers, and Research Tool and Die (RT&D).\nIn October, Fairbanks Morse Defense acquired American Fan,  and in 2024, the company purchased Massachusetts-based metalworking supplier Samtan Engineering Corporation.\n\n\n=== Structure ===\nFairbanks Morse Defense currently powers more than 80% of the Navy's ships with medium-speed engine applications. The company's structure involves Fairbanks Morse Services, Fairbanks Morse Technology and FMD's Strategic Collaborators.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Guyane La Première, is a French overseas departmental free-to-air television channel that broadcasts from Remire-Montjoly. The channel can be seen throughout French Guiana. It is operated by the overseas unit of France Télévisions.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe station began broadcasting on January 13, 1967, as Télé-Guyane. From its beginnings, it was part of the ORTF network until its dissolution in 1974.\nIn 1975, ORTF's overseas channels (including French Guiana) became part of the overseas division of the France Régions 3 network, changing its name to \"FR3-Guyane\"; while in 1982 the stations became part of the Société de Radiodiffusion et de télévision Française pour l'Outre-mer (RFO).\nOn January 1, 1999, after the reconversion of the RFO into \"Réseau France Outre-mer\", the French Guiana signal once again used the name \"Telé-Guyane\".\nOn July 9, 2004, with Law 2004-669 on Broadcasting Reform, the Réseau France Outre-mer media were integrated into the public company France Télévisions.\nOn November 30, 2010, the channel began broadcasting on digital terrestrial television through Channel 1. In addition, as a consequence of the name change of the overseas channel to \"Réseau Outre-Mer 1ere\", it also changed its name to \"Guyane 1ere\", which would change again to \"Guyane La Première\" as of January 1, 2018 after a judicial agreement between France Télévisions and Groupe M6.\nOn November 29, 2011, the channel stopped broadcasting in analog format, starting to broadcast on Air only in digital format.\nOn January 15, 2020, Guyane La Première began broadcasting its programming in HD through satellite TV systems.\n\n\n== Programming ==\nMuch of its programming consists of broadcasting the contents of La Première, which is the public Radio and Television network for the overseas territories of France. In addition, the channel also has local programming, among which the news programs Midi Guyane and Guyane Soir stand out.\n\n\n== Transmitters ==\nGuyane La Première is broadcast in 17 communes through 19 transmitters, reaching 87% of the population in French Guiana.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Oligotypus is an extinct genus of griffinfly in the family Paralogidae. This genus is known from 4 species from the Carboniferous to Permian.\n\n\n== Species ==\nType species of the genus, Oligotypus tillyardi was described from lower Permian site in Kansas and Midco insect bed in Oklahoma. It was small griffinfly with wing length of 4 centimetres (1.6 in) as preserved.\nSecond species, O. makowskii was described from middle Pennsylvanian Francis Creek Shale in Illinois. It had wing which is 6.5 centimetres (2.6 in) long as preserved and estimated to have complete length of 9 centimetres (3.5 in).\nThird species, O. huangheensis was described from Pennsylvanian, Namurian stage, Yanghugou Formation (previously called as Tupo Formation) near the village of Xiaheyan in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China. It was originally described under its own genus Sinomeganeura, but it was synonymized to Oligotypus in 2013. The preserved segment is 48.6 millimetres (1.91 in) giving an estimated full length for the wing of approximately 70 millimetres (2.8 in).\nFourth species, O. tuscaloosae was described from Early Pennsylvanian Pottsville Formation of Alabama. It is the largest species of Oligotypus with preserved wing length of 7.7 centimetres (3.0 in) and estimated complete wing length of 13–16 centimetres (5.1–6.3 in).\n\n\n== Description ==\nAccording to O. huangheensis, it shows no indications of any color pattering that may have been present in life. In adult of the species would have had a full wingspan of around 150 millimetres (5.9 in). The overall size is considered small compared to other members of the subfamily such as Meganeura and Meganeuropsis, both with wings exceeding 250 millimetres (9.8 in) in length, and wingspans over 700 millimetres (28 in).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hylistics (from the ancient Greek ὕλη hýlē \"wood [in the sense of 'raw material'], substance, matter\") is the scientific study of narrative materials (Erzählstoffe). It defines itself as a transdisciplinary method of narrative material research, which is primarily used in the context of myth research. Closely associated with this is the concept of the hyleme.\nThe basis of hylistics is the distinction between a medium and the narrative material adapted in it. A material can be concretised in different media (e.g. text, image, oral tradition, film, dance or theatre play). The boundaries of the medium do not have to represent the boundaries of the narrative material - rather, a medium can encompass several materials (e.g. Ovid's Metamorphoses) or only outline or incompletely narrate a subject (e.g. an episode of the Trojan War in Homer's Iliad). With the help of hyleme analysis, a narrative material can be approximately extracted from a medium. The same material can be adapted in different ways in different media (e.g. the material of the Trojan War in the epic Iliad, the pseudo-historical Troy novel of Dictys or the movie Troy).\n\n\n== History of Research ==\nThe method of hylistics was developed in the context of transdisciplinary research groups on myth research, especially in Ancient Near Eastern Studies and Classical Philology at the University of Göttingen. In 2019, the classical philologist Christian Zgoll published a fundamental work on hylistic method and myth theory as a habilitation thesis under the name Tractatus mythologicus; further anthologies and monographs followed in the Mythological Studies (MythoS) series. In 2023, Annette and Christian Zgoll were honoured with the Prize of the Peregrinus Foundation of the Academy of Sciences and Literature in Mainz for their \"research on ancient mythological narratives and the development of an innovative methodology of comparative myth research\". In his overall presentation of the hundred-year history of myth research, the classical philologist and myth researcher Udo Reinhardt mentions Zgoll's Tractatus mythologicus as \"the latest handbook on myth theory\" with \"outstanding significance\" for modern myth research.\n\n\n== Hylemes and hyleme analysis ==\nMain article: Hyleme (with explanation of hyleme analysis)\nThe central method of hylistics is hyleme analysis, in which the sequence of its smallest plot-carrying units - so-called hylemes - is reconstructed from the medial concretion of a narrative material. These are expressed in a standardised way as active statements consisting of subject, predicate and, if necessary, further objects and determinations. Hylemes are not to be equated with a text, but conceived as transmedial components of narrative material that can be extracted from materials of different medial concretion and are themselves \"not fixed to a specific medial shape or individual language\". Thus, hylemes can only offer an approximation of a narrative material as such. Hyleme analysis serves as a tool that (especially in the case of mythical hyleme sequences) enables further investigations and insights:\n\nReconstruction of the logical sequence of events in a complex text\nReconstruction of the events in a story that has only been told in extracts or fragments\nComparison of different material (e.g. Greek Typhon and Hittite Illuyanka myth) or variants (e.g. Zeus' battle against Typhon in Hesiod and Apollodorus) or different medial concretions of the same material (e.g. epic Iliad and movie Troy)\nRecognising logical inconsistencies that can be indications of the stratification of a text or material (e.g. Bible text with several layers of editions), enabling to reconstruct competing or earlier variants of the material\n\n\n== Hylistic myth definition and myth research ==\nIn principle, the hylistic method can be applied to various types of material, but it was developed and applied in particular to the study of mythical material. A myth - in contrast to other narrative materials such as fairy tales and legends - is defined in hylistics as \"an Erzählstoff [narrative material] which is polymorphic through its variants and – depending on the variant – polystratic; an Erzählstoff in which transcending interpretations of what can be experienced form a hyleme sequence with an implicit claim to relevance for the interpretation and mastering of the human condition\".Accordingly, myths are characterised by several features:\n\nMyths always refer to objects of experience, i.e. the world as people know it from their own perception. For example, a myth can tell us where the sun comes from, but no myth ends with the fact that there are two suns in the sky. In regard to this aspect myth differ from fairy tales, which generally have no connection to the real world.\nThe objects of experience are transcended by the myth, i.e. embedded in a metaphysical context of meaning with the participation of gods or comparable supernatural forces. Thus, myths often serve to explain the origin (etiology) of the world, people, things, creatures, places, customs or institutions, but also their moral valuation and hierarchy.\nPolymorphism refers to the existence of a narrative material in different variants that differ to a certain extent in terms of content. The same myth can be told in different sources not only in different detail or with differing details, but can even differ in supposedly central plot points (e.g. the variant of the Medeia myth told by Aelian, in which she does not kill her children). The myth itself is therefore not defined by individual details, but can only be described approximately on the basis of the unity of protagonists, settings and plot elements as a whole. There is no \"standard version\" of a myth as opposed to \"deviating\" variants, but at best more or less well-known and influential variants. Mythical materials often refer to each other, but do not form a consistent fictional universe.\nPolystraty refers to the construction of a single variant or concretion from components of different origin, e.g. from other myths or different variants of the same material. The juxtaposition of hylemes from originally different variants can lead to inconsistencies at the level of the text or the variant of the respective material, which can provide information about the stratification and development of the text or material. Since the personality of mythical figures is often polystrate and therefore inconsistent in itself (in contrast to novel characters created by a single author), the attempt to understand myths through the individual character traits and motives of the acting figures is fundamentally misguided (\"psychological trap of myth interpretation\").Myths differ from the partly similar material types of legend and fairy tale primarily through the active intervention of gods. However, such distinguishing features are family resemblances that leave room for exceptions and overlaps (e.g. the appearance of God in fairy tales or Australian aboriginal dreamtime stories in which animals or humans take on the role of divine actors).\n\n\n== Literature ==\nReinhardt, Udo (2022).

It was the capstone of the COSMOS project, which aimed to observe and study how galaxies are affected by celestial environments. \n\n\n== Description ==\n2 million galaxies have been identified in the COSMOS field.   NASA and the ESO studied the COSMOS region, the region in which the mosaic was taken, and further research is ongoing. The mosaic itself covers a 2 square degree equatorial field. The age of the galaxies differ, spanning 75% of the age of the observable universe. \n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Purpose ===\nThe project and COSMOS field was a study of the way in which galaxies are influenced by physical properties and the environment that surrounds them. The COSMOS field was chosen to be the focal point of research due to its abundance of galaxies and other celestial bodies, and its scarcity of gas. The research from the project has be used to identify deep-space galaxies and astrophysics.\n\n\n=== COSMOS project ===\nThe Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) was a wide field observational astronomy project. It was aimed at observing the correlation between galaxies, star formations, active galactic nuclei and dark matter and how they evolve, with large-scale structures of the universe. The survey included imaging in multiple wavelengths and spectroscopic analysis from X-rays to radio waves, in a region of two square degrees in the Constellation Sextans.\nCOSMOS, when it was proposed in 2003 as an exploratory survey to be carried out with the Advanced Camera for Surveys of the Hubble, was the largest HST project ever approved. Combined with the fact that the area of sky proposed as a survey had never been the subject of observations, the project has stimulated the main world astronomical structures to explore the sky in this direction, thus resulting in one of the most substantial, deepest and most uniform data sets in the entire electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n\n== Comparisons ==\nHubbleSite states that \"the COSMOS field is the largest contiguous survey of the universe, that covers two square degrees of sky. By comparison, the Earth's Moon is one-half degree across. The field is being imaged by most major space-based and ground-based telescopes\". To compare, the well-known Hubble Ultra-Deep Field is the farthest visible view into the universe.\"\n\n\n== Records ==\nThe COSMOS field is the largest-ever contiguous survey of the Universe, and was the largest Hubble project ever approved before the CANDELS project was carried out from 2010 to 2013. \n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of deep fields\nHubble Deep Field, another large sky survey image taken by the Hubble\nHubble Ultra-Deep Field, another deep-space sky survey image taken by the Hubble\nCosmic Evolution Survey\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOverview of the image, by ESA Science & Technology",

        "content": "Yuriy Yevhenovych Rybchynskyi (Ukrainian: Ю́рій Євге́нович Рибчи́нський; born 22 May 1945) is a Ukrainian poet, songwriter and playwright who is a recipient of both the Hero of Ukraine and People's Artist of Ukraine. Interestingly, he was among the pioneers of contemporary Ukrainian pop music. Between 1998 and 2000, he served as the President of Ukraine's Cultural Advisor.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBorn on 22 May 1945, in the former Ukrainian neighbourhood of Podil in Kyiv. He attended an art school and enjoyed drawing as a youngster. In addition, he participated in athletics for eleven years, leaping from a pole since 1958. In the 1960s, Rybchynskyi began to take a serious interest in poetry. During the Khrushchev Thaw, all forms of art, including literature, were actively developing and society was experiencing a spiritual uplift. Unexpectedly, after the eighth grade, he began to write poems.\nRybchynskyi stated that he was incredibly lucky to have Les Taniuk as his first poetry teacher, however he is unsure of how his artistic life would have transpired. He was given his first collection of innocent childhood poetry. His writings have appeared in Ukrainian newspapers and in Kyiv from the ninth grade. Even though he was only in the ninth grade, he already knew that he would major in philology. He enrolled at Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv in 1962.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Songwriting ===\nRybchynskyi's works were published in Yunost, when he was eighteen years old. But eventually, something occurred that, as Maestro acknowledges, fundamentally altered the course of the rest of his life. He was already twenty years old, uninterested in music, and incapable of picking up an instrument. Ihor Poklad, a young composer who was still a student at the conservatorium and had written numerous successful songs, including Kokhana (Sweetheart), was presented to him.\n\nSince then, Rybchynskyi has developed into a songwriter in addition to a poet. Over the years, the poet has collaborated on creative projects with a wider variety of composers. Volodymyr Ivasyuk, Ihor Poklad, Mykola Mozghovyi and Ihor Shamo are just a few of the composers that collaborated with him to produce several hits in Ukrainian and Soviet Union pop music. His songs were sung at various times by Nina Matviienko, Nazariy Yaremchuk, Vasyl Zinkevych, Taisia Povaliy, Sofia Rotaru, Natalia Mohylevska, Ruslana Lyzhychko, Pavlo Zibrov, Tamara Gverdtsiteli, and several more well-known vocalists.\n\n\n=== Playwriting ===\nRybchynskyi started writing plays in the middle of the 1970s, and he and composer Vadym Ilin created musicals including Tovarysh Liubov (Comrade Liubov), Piznya Serenada (Late Serenade), Brekhukha (Liar), and Tvir Na Temu Kokhannia (An Essay On Love). Along with composer Mark Minkov, he co-wrote the musical Bila Hvardiia (1989), which was based on a novel by Mikhail Bulgakov. In 2005, he and composer Ihor Demarin co-wrote the rock opera The Perfumer, which was based on a novel by Patrick Süskind.\nMany operetta theaters, especially in Odesa, Sverdlovsk, Moscow, Kyiv, and other theaters in the Post-Soviet states, featured his musicals with great popularity. Rybchynskyi began writing my own plays for dramatic and music theaters in the early 1980s. Thus, plays like Judith, Tsar Irod, Psy, Dogs, Edith Piaf. Zhyttia V Kredyt, Edith Piaf. Life On Credit, Edith Piaf. Zhyttia V Kredyt, Edith Piaf. Betkhovenom, Mizh Misiatsem I Betkhovenom, Zustrich Veteraniv Dytiachoho Khrestovogo Pokhodu and Bila Vorona. The 1985 drama The White Crow served as the inspiration for the first Ukrainian rock opera, which was co-written with composer Hennadii Tatarchenko and performed in 1991 at the Ivan Franko National Academic Drama Theater under the direction of Ukrainian director Serhii Danchenko.\n\n\n== Books ==\nRybchynskyi has published the following poetry books:\n\nTree Theater (1991)\nTrain (2005)\nWhite Raven (2010)\nInsomnia (2010)\nCheLOVEk (2010)\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nRybchynskyi noted in a 2007 interview that Tamara Gverdtsiteli is his favourite singer. His father was a banker and his mother was a military physician. His poetry examinations came as a surprise to his parents because all of the male line of the his family enjoyed sketching.\n\n\n== Awards and recognitions ==\n\nRybchynskyi was presented with the title Hero of Ukraine award by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on 22 August 2020. He has received awards and recognitions such as:\n\n Hero of Ukraine Order of the State (22 August 2020)\n Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise Fifth Class (21 May 2015)\nPeople's Artist of Ukraine (25 May 2000)\nNational Legend of Ukraine (20 August 2021)\nHonored Art Worker of Ukraine (29 June 1995)\nLaureate of the All-Union Competitions' Best Song of the Year (1972, 1974, 1976, 1978–80, 1983, 1987–89)\nHonorary Citizen of Kyiv (May 2009)\nHonorary Citizen of Orléans\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "The TA-57 is a Soviet-era field telephone. It is a completely analog battery-powered wired system that is highly resistant to electronic interception and jamming.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first model of the TA-57 rolled out in 1957 for usage by the Soviet Armed Forces.\nAs of 2022, the TA-57 was reported to be in use by Ukrainian forces in the Russo-Ukrainian War.\nIt has been documented in human rights reports as a torture device during the conflict, with euphemisms utilizing the TA-57 as a \"phone call to Putin\" or \"call to Lenin\".\nIn 2024, a leaked photograph showed one of the suspects accused of the 2024 Crocus City Hall attack being tortured by Russian FSB interrogators by having his genitals electrocuted by a TA-57.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe TA-57 can be used for induction calls working with 2-wire lines in an OB (local battery) or a ZB (central battery) operation. It can be used to transmit voice messaging in ranges between 0.3 and 3.4 kHz, with a calling frequency of 15 to 45 Hz. Absolute signal level at output of transmission path with a 600Ω load ranges between -3 and +3 dBu. It also a has a deployment time of 2 minutes.\nPower is primarily drawn from a 10V lead–acid battery GB-U-1.3 (ГБ-10-У-1.3) with a capacity of 1.3 Ah, alternatively a 9V block battery can be utilized. In OB battery operation, a hand cranked magneto can be used to generate ringing.\nThe enclosing and body is made of Bakelite and its dimensions measure 22.2 x 16.5 x 7.9 cm, and weighs 2.8 kg.\nThere are multiple cables that are used, which can establish the range of the phone:\n\nField cable P-275 (П-275); 20 km range\nField cable P-274 (П-274); 40 km range\nField cable P-268 (П-268); 40–45 km range\nField cable P-271 (П-271); 125 km range\nOverhead line; up to 170 km range.\nWith a reception amplifier, the signal range of the phone can increase by 30-50%.\nIt is intended for operation ranging from -40 °C to 50 °C, and a max humidity of 98% at 25 °C.\nA modernized variant of it is known as a TA-57U.\n\n\n== Users ==\n Ukraine\n Russia\n\n\n=== Former users ===\n Soviet Union\n Iraq - one specimen in the Imperial War Museum was acquired during Operation Granby.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to TA-57 at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Photoserigraphy, also known as photo-screen printing or photoscreen printing, is a printing technique that combines photography and traditional screen printing processes. Here are the key aspects of photoserigraphy:\n1. **Photographic Process:** Photoserigraphy starts with creating a photographic image on a transparent material like a film positive or a photosensitive emulsion-coated screen.\n2. **Screen Preparation:** A fine mesh screen, typically made of silk or synthetic fibers, is coated with a light-sensitive emulsion.\n3. **Exposure:** The prepared screen is then exposed to light through the photographic image. The areas exposed to light harden, while the unexposed areas remain soft and can be washed away.\n4. **Washing:** After exposure, the screen is washed with water or a chemical solution to remove the unexposed emulsion, creating a stencil of the image on the screen.\n5. **Printing:** The stencil screen is then placed on the printing surface, and ink is forced through the screen using a squeegee. The ink passes through the open areas of the stencil onto the printing surface, reproducing the image.\n6. **Multiple Colors:** Photoserigraphy can use multiple screens, each with a different color, to create full-color prints. Each screen is aligned accurately to ensure proper color registration.\n7. **Applications:** Photoserigraphy is commonly used for printing on various materials such as paper, fabric, plastics, and metals. It is popular for creating posters, signage, apparel designs, and artwork with vibrant colors and fine details.",

        "content": "Karl Yosifovich Zvirinsky (Ukrainian: Karlo Yosipovich Zvirinsky; August 14, 1923, Lavrov village, (now Stary Sambir district, Lviv region of Ukraine) - October 8, 1997, Lviv) was a Ukrainian and Soviet artist and teacher.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nK. Zvirinsky received his primary 4-grade education at the Lavrov Basilian Monastery of St. Onuphrius. In 1942, having read an advertisement in a newspaper about the recruitment of students to the German art and industrial school, which operated a Ukrainian graphics department, he went to Lviv. By that time, the future artist was not interested in painting. Due to insufficient education for admission, he takes exams externally for a seven-year school.\nDuring this period, many artists in Lviv fled the hardships of the war from the east of Ukraine. V. G. Krichevsky, N. G. Butovich, V. A. Balyas, R. Yu. Selsky taught here, Zvirinsky graduated from a painting course in 1946 and subsequently became friends with him.\nLater he continued his studies at the department of monumental painting at the Lviv Institute of Decorative and Applied Arts (now the Lviv National Academy of Arts). In 1949, Zvirinsky was expelled for a year for the phrase he expressed:\n\nOne Cezanne apple is worth more than all the art of socialist realism taken together\nIn 1953, he began teaching painting and composition at the Lviv Institute of Decorative and Applied Arts.\n\n\n== Educational activities ==\nZvirinsky began to pass on his knowledge to the students of the Lvov Institute of Decorative and Applied Arts, grouping around himself a small team, which would eventually be called the “Karl Zvirinsky Academy.” It was a kind of home art school. The listeners were the later famous painters A. A. Bokotey (now rector of the Lviv Academy of Arts), E. N. Lysik (People's Artist of the Ukrainian SSR), Y. N. Motyka (winner of the Shevchenko Prize in 1972) and many others.\nIn addition, for a long time K. Zvirinsky headed the school of icon painting named after. St. Luke at the monastery of the Studite Order in Lavrov.\n\n\n== Art ==\nAbstract artist. I began my search for my own creative path in abstract art by studying appliqué. In the 1960s, the artist justified his departure into the abstract space of painting, appliqué, colored paper or wood relief on canvas as an escape from socialist realism, while at the same time not denying the achievements of the great realists.\nIn his works, he created a kind of parallel reality, an extremely integral world. This worldview is already distinguished by his compositions of the late 1950s, created using wood, tin, cardboard, and cord.\nIn the creative heritage of Karl Zvirinsky, however, the predominant part of the works is sacred painting. He painted about 40 icons for the Assumption Church in Lviv, and created frescoes in several churches near Lviv.\n\n\n== Works ==\n“Relief III” (1957, composition composed of square and rectangular wooden blocks covered with layers of blue and purple paint)\n“Composition-II” (1960, canvas, plaster)\ntriptych “Earth.

        "content": "The Manipur – Burmese wars of 1717–1749  were a series of conflicts between Manipur under Gharib Niwaz and the Toungo kingdom of Burma.\n\n\n== Background ==\n \nThe conflict between the Kingdom of Manipur and the Kingdom of Burma, also known as Awa, was sparked by a series of events rooted in familial ties and political grievances. Following the demotion of his sister, who was married to the Burmese King as Awa-Leima, Manipur King Charairongba harbored deep resentment. Before his demise, he tasked his son Pamheiba (Garibaniwaz) with avenging this slight against their family. The tensions escalated when a delegation from Burma, accompanied by Samsok emissaries, arrived in Manipur seeking a Meitei princess's hand in marriage. Despite King Garibaniwaz's courteous reception, the presence of the Samsok people further fueled his anger, setting the stage for further hostilities between the two kingdoms.\n\n\n== Conflicts ==\n\n\n=== Battle of Ningthi River ===\nInstead of the bride party, the Army of Manipur fell upon the Burmese and committed a surprise and terrible attack.\n\n\n=== Invasion of Pong ===\nIn 1739 A.D, in response to an appeal from the princess of Pong kingdom, Pamheiba again invaded Burma and removed the Burmese from (Mogaung), the capital of Pong, and raised the eldest prince of Pong to the throne of Pong.\n\n\n=== Capture of Sagaing ===\nAfter freeing Pong from the Burmese, Pamheiba and his army went on to occupy Sagaing, situated on the western bank of the Ayeyarwadday Irrawaddy, which was once the seat of Government of Burma. In February 1740 A.D he captured Sagaing. It is to be noted that in the year between 1662–1672 A.D, a son of the King of Ava reigned in pong, after whom, the succession again reverted to the lineal descendants of their ancient race of kings, five are mentioned, whose united reigns bring the history of that country down the year 1734 A. D. Now, about this time, two princes of Pong – Mongpa and Kyethon – fled to Raja Gharib niwaz (Pamheiba) of Manipur solicited his protection against the  Burmese, he attacked and destroyed the town of Sagaing and established the two princes Mungkhong in the month of May, bestowed his daughter Yenjiyoyai in marriage on the elde From Mungkhong they returned in August to Mongmaorang, the ancient capital of Pong, when t eldest reigned for a short and uncertain period.\n\n\n=== Second Siege of Sagaing and Myedu ===\nIn 1740 CE, the empire of Pamheiba was extensive and populous. King Maha Dharma Raja  Dibati of Toungoo dynasty of Burma could not acquiesce in the loss of his strategic towns happily and waited for an opportunity to strike blow for their recovery. In mid 1740 CE, the Burmese made a fresh bid for recovery of Sagaing and Myedu and laid siege to the towns. In October 1740 CE, the King of Pong sent his envoys to acknowledge the news to his master Pamheiba. Accordingly, in December 1740 CE, Pamheiba undertook another expedition against Burma to secure complete submission of Sagaing, but could not fulfill his task as the Maring rebellion compelled him to leave the expedition to his generals and returned to his capital. The generals continued the operations against the Burmese. After staying six days in the capital, Pamheiba again set out to invade Burma. He penetrated again up to the town of Sagaing opposite Ava. While encamped at Sagaing his standard was brown down, taking this as an evil omen he negotiated a peace treaty with the King of Ava. As a sequel to the peace, the king of Ava sent many embassies to the court of Pamheiba requesting a daughter in marriage.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nShamsokngamba puya describes the personal courage and military skills of Gharib nawaz. His words in the battlefield could reverse the adverse battlefield-situations. An excerpt from the above puya:\n\n\"Tayam Nakhoibu Khoyam Karigee Namai Leirakpano. Lairel Eibu Leiye. Lairel eepa Meitengu Tubi Charairongba Kharam Tusuk Ngamba Mapari Panba Hathnongbu kharophaba Keiren Nausongbada Songlophaba eibu leiye. Tayam Nakhoibu Khoiram Namai Leigano. \nTranslation\n\"Why would you soldiers turn your face from the battlefield? I am here with you. Do not turn back your face from the battle\"\nBy drawing exclusively from the Burmese historical records, among other primary sources, E.W. Dun described as to how Gharibnawaz, with as many a thirty thousand Manipuri army, defeated the Burmese army in as many as seven wars including the wars in 1725, 1735, 1738, 1739 and 1749. Manipur power overwhelmed the Burmese at a time when Gharib nawaz reached the zenith. With his abdication from the throne in 1749 and five-year instability, which followed till 1754 during the reign of his sons Ajitsai and Bharatsai, Manipur power had slid down to abyss.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Flanders Banks is an array of nine sandbanks which extend off the coast of Dunkirk, France, in the south of the North Sea.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nA short distance from Dunkirk lie the banks of Flanders, generally submerged less than five meters deep and separated by furrows ten to twenty meters deep. These sandbanks, also called sublittoral sandy sedimentary groups, are oriented from east-northeast to west-southwest and arranged parallel to the shore of the North Sea. They close the Dunkirk harbour, forcing ships to follow marked passages to enter or leave the port: the West Pass and the Zuydcoote Pass. It is to the north of the latter that the banks can be seen emerging at low tide.The continental base is relatively shallow in this area and the banks were formed by tidal currents. Their formation is linked to the flow gain, that is to say that the mass of materials brought by the flow is greater than that removed by the ebb. These banks can take on the appearance of real underwater dunes formed from the accumulation of shell sand, called hydraulic dunes, rising around twenty meters above the seabed.\n\n\n== Environment ==\nThe Flanders banks are integrated into the perimeter of the Natura 2000 Bancs de Flandres site which covers a vast area of 1,132 km2 in the North sea off the coast of France. The banks are relatively poor in terms of biological diversity however the sandbanks are home to species characteristic of this type of formation such as the sand urchin . The area is notable for the presence of marine mammals, with a sedentary population of seals and episodic populations of grey seals and porpoises.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024 Zabaykalsky Krai gubernatorial election will take place on 8 September 2024, on common election day. Incumbent Governor Aleksandr Osipov is running to a second term in office.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAleksandr Osipov, former First Deputy Minister for the Development of the Far East and Arctic, was appointed acting Governor of Zabaykalsky Krai in October 2018. Osipov replaced retiring Governor Natalia Zhdanova, who resigned at her own request three years before the end of her first term. Zhdanova's resignation was mostly credited to low performance in socio-economic development, decreasing approval ratings and poor results of United Russia in the 2018 regional elections.\nLegislative Assembly of Zabaykalsky Krai changed the electoral law in March 2019, allowing Independent candidates to run in the gubernatorial election. Osipov ran for a full term as an Independent and overwhelmingly won with 89.61% against three candidates from minor parties, as candidates from major opposition parties (CPRF, LDPR, A Just Russia) were absent from the ballot. \nIn April 2024 during a meeting with President Vladimir Putin Governor Osipov announced his intention to run for a second term and received Putin's endorsement. \n\n\n== Candidates ==\nIn Zabaykalsky Krai candidates for Governor can be nominated by registered political parties or by self-nomination. Candidate for Governor of Zabaykalsky Krai should be a Russian citizen and at least 30 years old. Candidates for Governor should not have a foreign citizenship or residence permit. Each candidate in order to be registered is required to collect at least 8% of signatures of members and heads of municipalities. In addition, self-nominated candidates should collect 0.5% of signatures of Zabaykalsky Krai residents. Also gubernatorial candidates present 3 candidacies to the Federation Council and election winner later appoints one of the presented candidates.\n\n\n=== Declared ===\nAleksandr Osipov (Independent), incumbent Governor of Zabaykalsky Krai (2018–present)\n\n\n== See also ==\n2024 Russian regional elections\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Boychukism is a cultural and artistic phenomenon in the history of Ukrainian art of 1910-1930s, distinguished by its artistic monumental-synthetic style.\nThe basis of Boychuk's concept of the development of new art was an appeal to the traditions of Byzantine and Italian monumental painting, as well as middle-age Rus' icon painting, as the primary source of the Ukrainian national form.\nThe name comes from the name of the founder of the movement: Mikhail Boychuk, a muralist and graphic artist. Boychuk, as well as several other artists, made Soviet propaganda and promoted communism. However, Boychuk was labelled as a \"bourgeois nationalist\" by Joseph Stalin, and he was executed.\nAt the end of 1925, the Association of Revolutionary Art of Ukraine (ARIU) was founded in Kyiv, uniting Boychukists.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

It was discovered on 1 February 2006 by the Siding Spring Survey. The object has been suggested to be the progenitor body of the β Tucanids or δ Mensids meteor showers, being, according to Diego Janches et al, a better candidate than the previously suggested comet C/1976 D1 (Bradfield). They also suggest the two showers are actually one and the same. The meteor shower produced outbursts in 2020 and 2024.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n(248590) 2006 CS at NeoDyS-2, Near Earth Objects—Dynamic Site\nEphemerides · Observation prediction · Orbital info · MOID · Proper elements · Observational info · Close approaches · Physical info · Orbit animation\n(248590) 2006 CS at ESA–space situational awareness\nEphemerides · Observations · Orbit · Physical properties · Summary\n(248590) 2006 CS at the JPL Small-Body Database",

        "content": "A hyleme (from the ancient Greek ὕλη hýlē \"wood [in the sense of 'raw material'], substance, matter\") is - analogous to terms such as morpheme, phoneme or mytheme - a \"smallest plot-carrying unit of a narrative material\". The term was coined in the context of transdisciplinary research groups on myth research at the University of Göttingen, the method being taken up by the myth researcher Udo Reinhardt and rewarded with the prize of the Peregrinus Foundation in 2023. Narrative material research (Stoffwissenschaft) itself is referred to as hylistics, which was primarily developed as a method for researching ancient myths, but can principially be applied to all genres of narrative material.\nIn distinction to the literary terms of event and motif, the use of which is primarily limited to literary texts, the hyleme is intended to describe a transmedial unit of narrative material that can be extracted from different medial concretions and is itself \"not fixed to a particular medial design or individual language\". \"Hylemes cannot be postulated deductively, but can only be obtained inductively by extraction from individually available medial concretions. Just as phonemes and morphemes only become tangible in the form of certain individual phones and morphemes, hylemes are only tangible in their different medial forms of concretion.\" The process of extracting a sequence of hylemes (hyleme sequence) from a medial concretion is referred to as hyleme analysis.\nA hyleme as the \"smallest action-bearing unit\" basically comprises a statement that consists of at least one subject and predicate, to which further (direct or indirect) objects and/or determinations can be added. Hylemes are always formulated in the active state, even if the logical agent is unknown: instead of \"Prometheus is punished\", the hyleme reads \"Zeus punishes Prometheus\" or \"NN punishes Prometheus\" (if the agent is unknown).\nHylemes include not only actions in the narrower sense, but also processes and statements about states and characteristics. Zgoll 2019 distinguishes between dynamic (\"Zeus kills Erechtheus\") and static hylemes (\"Zeus is the king of the gods\"). This division was revised in later publications in favour of a division into punctual and durative hylemes, the latter being divided into durative-constant (always applies: \"Zeus is the son of Kronos. \"), durative-initial (applies at the beginning of the plot, but not forever: \"Zeus is unmarried\") and durative-resultative hylemes (applies only in the course of the plot: \"Zeus is the husband of Hera\").\n\n\n== Hyleme analysis ==\nIn a hyleme analysis, all the information of a given medium - e.g. a text - is reproduced in the standardised form of hylemes. A second step consists of reconstructing the logical sequence of actions, which not necessarily has to correspond to the sequence of statements in the text, as well as any implicit hylemes that can inevitably be reconstructed.\n\n\n=== Example ===\nA mythical material in the concretion of a text can read as follows:\"When Chryse, the daughter of Pallas, was married to Dardanos, she brought with her as a dowry gifts from Athena, namely the shrines of the great gods.\"The following hylemes can be extracted from this statement:\nChryse is the daughter of Pallas\nAthena gives Chryse the sanctuaries of the great gods\nChryse brings the sanctuaries of the great gods to the wedding as a dowry\nDardanos marries Chryse\nHere, the first statement \"Chryse is the daughter of Pallas\" is a static or durative-constant hyleme, while the others are dynamic/punctual hylemes. In a further step, the implicit durative-resultative hylemes \"Chryse and Dardanos are (now) married\" and \"Chyrse is (now) the wife of Dardanos\"/\"Dardanos is (now) the husband of Chryse\" could also be reconstructed from the given hyleme sequence. The reconstruction of implicit hylemes, which logically follow from the given hyleme sequence but are not explicitly mentioned in the text, can promise further insights, but their scope must be weighed up depending on the individual case.\n\n\n=== Use ===\nHyleme analysis is a methodological tool for extracting the material (i.e. the pure content) from a medium (e.g. a literary text) and making it visible in a standardised way. This enables further investigations and insights, especially in the case of mythical hyleme sequences:\n\nReconstruction of the logical sequence of events in a complexly formulated text\nReconstruction of the events in a material that has only been narrated in extracts or fragments\nComparison of different narrative materials (e.g. Greek Typhon and Hittite Illuyanka myths) or variants (e.g. Zeus' battle against Typhon in Hesiod and Apollodorus) or different media concretisations of the same material (e.g. epic Iliad and movie Troy)\nRecognising logical inconsistencies that can be indicators of stratification of a text or material (e.g. Bible text with several layers of editions)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nReinhardt, Udo (2022).

The leaves are similar to those of the mango - they are oblong to obovate and may reach 40 cm (16 in) in length and 7 cm (2.8 in) wide, with up to 25 pairs of lateral veins on either side of the midrib. The leaf blade tapers gradually into the petiole (leaf stalk), making it difficult to determine where one ends and the other begins.\nThe inflorescences are panicles about 17 cm (6.7 in) long produced from the leaf axils, flowers are about 4 mm (0.16 in) wide.\nThe fruit is a red to black drupe about 7 mm (0.28 in) diameter, containing a single seed.\n\n\n=== Phenology ===\nFlowering has been observed in September and fruit appear between September and December.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThis species was first described in 1869 by Ferdinand von Mueller in his massive work Fragmenta phytographiæ Australiæ, based on material collected by John Dallachy from the Family Islands group, about 120 km (75 mi) south of Cairns in a direct line.\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe species epithet mangoides is a reference to the similarity of the foliage to that of the common mango.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThis species is found on a number of inshore islands north and south of Cairns, from Snapper Island near the mouth of the Daintree River, south to Orpheus Island, about 80 km (50 mi) northwest of Townsville. It also occurs rarely on the mainland adjacent to some of the islands. The altitudinal range is close to sea level.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nThis species is listed by the Queensland Government's Department of Environment, Science and Innovation as least concern. As of 25 March 2024, it has not been assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nView a map of herbarium collections of this species at the Australasian Virtual Herbarium\nView observations of this species on iNaturalist\nView images of this species on Flickriver.com",

All 27 members of Redditch Borough Council in Worcestershire will be elected following boundary changes.\n\n\n== Background ==\nRedditch was a traditionally Labour council. Labour controlled the council from 1976 until 2000, and again from 2004 to 2006. The Conservatives took control of the council from no overall control in 2010, but lost control to Labour in 2012.\nThe Conservatives retook the council in 2018, and have controlled the council ever since. In the most recent election, the Conservatives lost 5 seats with a vote share of 38.8%, and Labour gained 5 with 43.8%.\n\n\n== Boundary changes ==\nRedditch usually elects its councillors in thirds, on a 4-year cycle. However, following boundary changes, all councillors will be elected to the new wards. The change reduces the number of councillors by 2.\n\n\n== Previous council composition ==\n\nChanges:\n\nJanuary 2024: Kerrie Miles joins Liberal Democrats from Labour\n\n\n== Summary ==\n\n\n=== Election result ===\n\n\n== Candidates ==\n\n\n=== Astwood Bank & Feckenham ===\n\n\n=== Batchley & Brockhill ===\n\n\n=== Central ===\n\n\n=== Greenlands & Lakeside ===\n\n\n=== Headless Cross & Oakenshaw ===\n\n\n=== Matchborough & Woodrow ===\n\n\n=== North ===\n\n\n=== Webheath & Callow Hill ===\n\n\n=== Winyates ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Shaykh Rajab Mosque (Arabic:جامع الشيخ رجب), formerly known as the Al-Barani Mosque, is a historic mosque located at Rawa, Iraq. It is named for Sayyid Rajab al-Rawi al-Rifa'i, a patron saint and follower of the Rifa'i Sufi order. The mosque is divided into two parts; the modern part is still used for prayer while the historic part dating to 1625 is flooded and hence is not used for prayer.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Al-Barani Mosque was constructed in 1625, next to the cemetery containing the (now-destroyed) mausoleum of Shaykh Rajab. In 1989, the town of Rawa was flooded, and along with much of the town, the mosque sank as well. With the architectural supervision of Raed Ali al-Rawi, a modern mosque structure known as the Shaykh Rajab Mosque was built on top of the sunken mosque in 1992, which is still in use to this day. The old mosque is still visible but it is not used.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mosques in Iraq\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Bishr al-Marisi (Arabic: بشر المريسي born 755, died 813) full name Abu 'Abd al-Rahman Bishr ibn Ghiyath ibn Abi Karimah al-Marisi or simply Bishr ibn Ghiyath al-Marisi was a 9th-century religious scholar and theologian. He was infamous for his controversial views which earned him the scorn of his contemporary Muslim scholars.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nBishr's father, Ghiyath, was a Jewish slave or jeweller from Kufa who had reverted to Islam and become a mawla of the Quraysh tribe.\n\n\n=== Pursuit of knowledge and asceticism ===\nIn adulthood, Bishr became an ascetic, and he took scholarly knowledge from Hanafi scholars, such as Abu Yusuf. However, he later adopted the Jahmite views after he learned them from a group of Jahm bin Safwan's students. Abu Yusuf disassociated with Bishr after finding out that he had Jahmite or Murji'ite tendencies.\nBishr also conducted theological debates with Al-Shafi'i, and in his free time he made offensive melodies and poetry.\n\n\n=== Death ===\nBishr al-Marisi died in the year 813. According to Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi, the people of Baghdad (whom were influenced by Bishr's opponents) rejoiced upon hearing news of his death.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nBishr al-Marisi was criticized and subsequently excommunicated by many scholars who lived contemporary to him, and after him. The Shafi'ite jurist Uthman ibn Sa'id al-Darimi wrote a book titled Naqd 'Uthman ibn Sa'id 'alal-Marisi al-Jahmi al-Anid, which was a detailed refutation of Bishr and his theology. The Hanafite jurist Abd al-Aziz al-Kinani published a treatise titled Kitab al-Haydah, which served a similar purpose. Some other scholars had murderous desires against him and attempted to incite violence against him. One such example was Yazid ibn Harun, whom encouraged his neighbours to assault and kill Bishr.\nThe Tabi' al-Tabi'een members, Sufyan ibn Uyaynah and Abd Allah ibn al-Mubarak excommunicated Bishr al-Marisi. Even Sufis like Bishr Hafi did the same, and were harsh against Bishr's opinions especially his views on the createdness of the Qur'an and God's divine attributes. Abu Bakr al-Khallal also forbade people from praying behind Bishr al-Marisi.\n\n\n=== Praise ===\nDespite the harsh criticisms from many scholars, Bishr al-Marisi was praised by the historian Al-Dhahabi, who regarded him as a brilliant speaker and debater. Ibn al-Nadim regarded Bishr as a great ascetic who wrote books in refutation of the Kharijites and Shi'ites. Later theologians like Ibn Furak, Fakhr al-Din al-Razi and Abu Mansur al-Maturidi incorporated some of Bishr's theological principles into their own theological concepts.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMurji'ah\nIbn Kullab\nJahm bin Safwan\nJahmi school\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Uthman ibn Sa'id al-Darimi (Arabic:عثمان بن سعيد الدارمي), full name Abu Sa'eed Uthman ibn Sa'id ibn Khalid ibn Sa'id al-Darimi, was a 9th-century Islamic scholar and Athari theologian. A narrator of hadith, he was known for being extremely strict against the Jahmi and Karami schools of thought which prevailed during his time. His best known work is the Naqd 'Uthman ibn Sa'id 'alal-Marisi al-Jahmi al-Anid, a detailed refutation against one of his contemporaries, Bishr al-Marisi.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nUthman ibn Sa'id al-Darimi was born in the year 815. He adhered to the Shafi'i school of thought. Darimi learned hadith and other prophetic traditions from the leading scholars of his time, Ali ibn al-Madini, Yahya ibn Ma'in and the founder of the Hanbali school, Ahmad ibn Hanbal. He became a narrator of hadith, and later scholars like Ibn Hibban and Hakim al-Nishapuri would narrate hadith from him.\nUthman ibn Sa'id al-Darimi died in the year 894.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nUthman ibn Sa'id al-Darimi was known for his aggression against the Jahmi school. He was severe against Bishr al-Marisi, even going as far as to excommunicate him and write a book of refutations against him. His writings were quoted by later traditionist Athari scholars like Ibn Taymiyyah.\nAside from the Jahmis, Darimi was also against the Karami school. He stood against them, denouncing them repeatedly for their anthropomorphistic beliefs regarding God's nature. His persistent efforts to defame the Karamiyyah resulted in their founder, Ibn Karram, being expelled from Nishapur.\nThe historian Al-Dhahabi said that Darimi was a “stinger in the eyes of the heretics.”\n\n\n== Works ==\nNaqd 'Uthman ibn Sa'id 'alal-Marisi al-Jahmi al-Anid\nAl-Radd 'ala al-Jahmiyyah\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Atharis\nList of Islamic scholars\n\n\n== References ==",

He was the son of Abdullah Bahauddin al-Alusi, who was in turn the son of Mahmud al-Alusi. Hence, Mahmud Shukri was the grandson of Mahmud al-Alusi.\nAs an adult, Mahmud Shukri al-Alusi lived his life between teaching and writing, and he contributed to the creation and editing of the first newspaper in Baghdad, the Al-Zawra Newspaper. He also contributed to supplying articles and research for magazines such as the Al-Manar magazine. His rational and almost extremist tendencies regarding Sufism and creed earned him the scorn of the Ash'ari scholar Abu al-Huda al-Sayyadi who refuted him and requested Ahmed Abdel Wahab Pasha to send him into exile from Baghdad. In his exile, Mahmud Shukri al-Alusi was sent to Mosul, but the residents of Mosul, who felt sympathy for him, petitioned for him to be allowed to return to Baghdad. In Mosul, he studied under the scholar Ibrahim bin Mustafa al-Mawsili.\nWhen the British occupied Iraq in 1921, the British officials treated Mahmud Shukri al-Alusi nicely and invited him to be the main scholar giving out the fatwa (religious rulings and verdicts). Mahmud Shukri declined this offer and chose to continue his work as a teacher and scholar.\nMahmud al-Alusi died on the 18th of May in 1924 from a chronic disease. He was buried in the Sheikh Ma'ruf Cemetery of Baghdad. \n\n\n== Views ==\n\nMahmud Shukri al-Alusi was an Athari in creed and a Hanafi in his jurisprudence, although he would sometimes identify with the Shafi'i school of thought. He was tolerant of Sufism but he disliked those went extravagant in Sufism, such as Yusuf al-Nabhani. Mahmud Shukri even wrote a refutation against Yusuf al-Nabhani, known as Ghayat al-Amani fi al-Radd 'ala al-Nabhani.\nDespite his Salafi-influenced beliefs, Mahmud Shukri al-Alusi opposed the Wahhabi movement. However, he defended them on creedal matters, and he even denied the violence of the Wahhabis in Arabia. He even called Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab the title Shaykh al-Islam.\n\n\n== Works ==\nBulugh al-Arab fi ma'rifat ahwal al-Arab\nTarikh Najd\nGhayat al-Amani fi al-Radd 'ala al-Nabhani\n\n\n== See also ==\nMuhammad Bahjat Athari\nSalafism\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 1996 Abakan Ilyushin IL-76 crash took place on 27 November 1996 near Abakan Airport (ABA), Russia involving a Russian Air Force Ilyushin Il-76MD transport aircraft, registered as RA-78804 killing all 23 people onboard including 14 passengers.\nThe plane was on a cargo flight from Moscow Zhukovsky Airport to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky Airport, with a scheduled stopover in Abakan. Carrying an official payload of 30 tons (66,137 lbs), the aircraft underwent refueling at Abakan before attempting takeoff. However, during the climb-out phase, the plane ascended with an unusually shallow climb angle, deviating from standard procedures. Instead of initiating a turn 4 km from the runway at a minimum altitude of 200 m, the aircraft continued on a straight path until reaching the designated altitude. By this point, the plane was turning towards rising terrain. The aircraft collided with a hillside 14 km beyond the runway, resulting in a fire. 23 people died instantly in impact with no survivors.\n\n\n== See also ==\nControlled flight into terrain\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Louisa Mak Ming-Sze (Chinese: 麥明詩; born 11 December 1991) is an Australian-born Hong Kong actress, television host, lawyer, and entrepreneur. After graduating from the University of Cambridge with a law degree, Mak made her debut in the entertainment industry through winning Miss Hong Kong Pageant in 2015. She starred in  Patrick Kong's romance film L for Love L for Lies Too (2016), as well as TVB drama series Line Walker: The Prelude and My Ages Apart (both 2017), before receiving a nomination for Most Improved Female Artiste in the 2018 TVB Anniversary Awards with her performance in legal drama series OMG, Your Honour (2018). Mak also served as one of the co-hosts of the TVB talk show Young And Restless from 2017 to 2019.\nMak withdrew from showbiz in 2019 and worked as an associate at McKinsey & Company after she was called to the bar in New York. She left McKinsey in 2022 and co-founded Project Melo, a company that focuses on youth empowerment, in the same year. She was also appointed as a director of Legendary Education in 2023.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMak was born on December 11, 1991, in Australia, to a middle-class family. Her father was a chemistry teacher and had served as the vice principal of Sheng Kung Hui Lam Woo Memorial Secondary School, while her mother worked as an occupational therapist. She has an elder brother, Vincent, who pursued a career as a plastic surgeon. In 1994, when Mak was three years old, her family relocated to Hong Kong. She grew up in Ma On Shan and attended a nearby kindergarten in her neighbourhood. She then attended Diocesan Girls' Junior School, an elite school in Hong Kong, and achieved excellent academic results. During this time, Mak also began to learn ballet, piano, and singing, earning ABRSM Grade 8 in both piano and vocal music. She was also a member of the school's choir. In 2003, she was selected to participate in a space camp program in Alabama, United States, and had the honor of welcoming Chinese astronaut Yang Liwei on behalf of Hong Kong. After graduating from primary school, Mak continued her studies at Diocesan Girls' School. She developed an interest in sports and joined the school's volleyball team. In 2007, Mak travelled to the United Kingdom with her family and visited King's College, Cambridge. She was captivated by the university's environment and aspired to study there. Although Mak was interested in history, she decided to choose science subjects as they offered a higher potential for achieving good grades. She took a total of ten subjects and obtained straight A's, the highest attainable score, along with thirteen other candidates in the 2009 Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination.\nMak moved to Crowthorne, Berkshire and attended Wellington College for her matriculation, to acclimate herself to the British academic environment prior to her university studies. Following the completion of her A-Levels in 2011, Mak read law at Newnham College, Cambridge. During her time at Cambridge, she participated in rowing, and established the Hong Kong and China Affairs Society, serving as the society's president. In 2014, Mak graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (later promoted to Master of Arts by seniority in 2018) in law, with upper second class honours. She then took and passed the New York Bar Examination in February 2015, and was called to bar in November 2018.\n\n\n== Entertainment career ==\n\n\n=== 2015–2016: Winning Miss Hong Kong ===\nMak participated in the Miss Hong Kong 2015 beauty pageant contest hosted by TVB, describing her motive as \"seeking uniqueness in an ordinary life\" and \"finding a way to emphasize her own traits and characteristics.\" Her academic achievement and status as a perfect scorer in the HKCEE garnered media attention, earning her the nickname of \"10A Miss Hong Kong.\" Mak became a fan favourite and successfully advanced through the preliminary round in July, securing a place among the final twelve contestants. During the contest finals on August 30, she delivered a speech challenging the imposition of traditional Chinese feminine virtues on women. She received over 50% of the votes from the audience and emerged as the champion, also receiving the Miss Photogenic special award. The following year, Mak represented Hong Kong in the Miss Chinese International Pageant 2016, but she was eliminated prior to the round of five.\n\n\n=== 2016–2017: Entering showbiz ===\nAfter winning the Miss Hong Kong title, Mak engaged in negotiations with TVB but declined their initial offer of a ten-year contract, instead opting to sign as an artist for five years, with a mere HK$1,600 of guaranteed wage and no fixed quotas for acting jobs. In 2016, she debuted onscreen as a host of the English lifestyle information television program Dolce Vita on TVB Pearl, and went to Rio de Janeiro, serving as a guest reporter for TVB during the 2016 Olympic Games. The same year, she hosted the travel program A Starry Home Coming, which documented Mak's return to and tour of her alma maters, Wellington College and the University of Cambridge. However, the program became embroiled in controversy when The Tab, a Cambridge student publication, reported that Mak and her camera crew were causing a scene at the Cambridge Spring Ball by attempting to take advantage of the free alcohol, and was escorted out of the ball for failing to provide press passes. Mak later refuted these rumors in an interview with The Standard, asserting that they had applied for approval weeks before the shoot and that the filming had proceeded smoothly, while criticizing The Tab as a tabloid that was not taken seriously by Cambridge students. She was also invited by director Patrick Kong to make her acting debut and star in his romance film L for Love L for Lies too later in the same year, where she assumed the second female lead role of Si Ting, the sketchy best friend and younger sister of a pair of lovers played by Stephy Tang and Wilfred Lau.\nIn June 2017, Mak made her television debut in the TVB gambling-themed mystery thriller series Bet Hur as Dorothy To, portraying the granddaughter of Lau Siu Ming's character who was unaware of her family's dark history in the casinos. She also lent her voice for the protagonist Jailbreak in the Cantonese dub version of the American animated film The Emoji Movie. Mak subsequently experienced a career breakthrough by co-hosting talk show Young And Restless, alongside Crystal Fung and Luk Ho Ming. The show garnered positive viewership, and Mak received a nomination for Most Popular TV Partnership along with Fung at the TVB Anniversary Awards in the subsequent year. In September, Mak took on the role of Cherry Yeung, one of the five undercover agents working under an inspector played by Michael Miu, in the espionage thriller series Line Walker: The Prelude. In November, she appeared in another supporting lead role in the comedy series My Ages Apart as Sung Kai Kai, an unconfident young girl who was entangled in a love triangle with her sister and a wealthy playboy played by Anjaylia Chan and Dickson Yu.\n\n\n=== 2018–2022: Breakout and fade out ===\nMak secured a lead role as Helen Ha, a rookie solicitor confronted by the harsh realities of the legal profession, in the 2018 legal drama series OMG, Your Honour. Screenwriter Lee Sin described the role as \"tailor-made\" for Mak, aligning with her real-life experiences and personality, and she was consulted by the crew regarding the specifics and jargons of the legal profession on set. She received a nomination for Most Improved Female Artiste in the 2018 TVB Anniversary Awards with her performance. Following the production, she was in talks with TVB about penning a legal drama screenplay. She also made a minor appearance in Patrick Kong's film A Beautiful Moment as an MK girl. In early 2019, Mak hosted two travel programs, I Go to School By Bike and Holland Fun. The former documented Mak's participation in a charity bike ride from Hong Kong to Cambodia, during which she sustained injuries and was hospitalized in Guangxi, China. Later that year, Mak pursued a career change and engaged in negotiations with TVB, resulting in a modification of her contract from a packaged contract to a special contract that only required one show per year. Mak's final project at TVB was in the role of Megan Yim, the blind daughter of a struggling assassin portrayed by Wayne Lai in the 2020 action thriller series Death By Zero. She gradually stepped away from the entertainment industry in 2020, and concluded her contract with TVB in 2022, announcing that she would not return as an artist and expressing that she was going on a different direction with the company.\nIn 2022, Mak took on the role of Emma So, the sole female lead in the business-themed mystery thriller web series Chasing the Times. She was introduced to producer Jonathan Chik through a mutual friend in the previous year, and Chik noticed the similarities between Mak and a character in his latest project, leading him to offer her the role. Mak agreed on the spot after reading the script and took a twenty-day leave from her job to participate in the filming of the web series.\n\n\n== Business career ==\nMak embarked on a career transition and joined McKinsey & Company as a junior associate in 2019. She was stationed in Taiwan since early 2020, specializing in business consultation. She later returned to Hong Kong and was promoted to the position of engagement manager, before departing from the consulting firm in 2022. She co-founded Project Melo, a youth empowerment company, in the same year. In 2023, Mak assumed a directorial role at Legendary Education, a publicly listed education company. She appeared in a documentary series produced by Trial & Error, where she shared her thoughts on education in the same year.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMak had dated disbarred barrister Jo Lam for three years, before breaking up in 2016. In 2022, Mak was rumored to be in a relationship with television host and former pilot Keith Shing, and she confirmed their relationship during a business event on October 30, 2023. Breaking with traditional gender roles, Mak, as the female, proposed to Shing, the male, and the couple became engaged on January 30, 2024. They registered for marriage in Australia in late February, and held their wedding ceremony, along with a poon choi feast, at Shing Uk Tsuen, Yuen Long on March 23.\nMak is a devout Christian, and actively advocates for feminism. She is also highly critical of socio-political issues. She participated in and voiced support for the 2014 Hong Kong protests, while expressed strong criticism against the controversial selection of University of Hong Kong pro-vice-chancellor and the Beating of Ken Tsang, denouncing them as assaults on academic freedom and the fundamental principles of the rule of law. Mak had also voiced support for Edward Leung and John Tsang in the 2016 Hong Kong legislative election and 2017 Hong Kong Chief Executive election, respectively.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n=== Television programs ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLouisa Mak at IMDb",

In that election she was sixth on the AD list for Porto and the coalition won 14 seats in the constituency. Neto has also served as a councillor on the Santo Tirso City Council.\nIn the parliament, she has served on several committees, including those on Constitutional Affairs, Rights, Freedoms and Guarantees; Social Security and Labour; Environment; Spatial Planning and Local Government; and Ethics. She also served as vice-president of the PSD parliamentary group.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nIn October 2021, Neto and her husband applied for investment support from the Vila Nova de Famalicão City Council to establish new headquarters, but had to withdraw the application as the rules forbade such support to financial entities. The application was resubmitted, with their company described as a business consultancy, and approved. In November 2022 the Transparency and Statute of Deputies Committee instructed Neto to correct her entry in the parliamentary register of interests, following suggestions that her role as the manager of a credit company was inconsistent with the rules governing the outside interests of parliamentary deputies. In December of the same year the committee voted in favour of a motion that there was no incompatibility. Neto had argued that her company served only as an intermediary between borrowers and lenders and did not handle funds. In January 2023 she was suspended from the Assembly for 60 days for her failure to attend any session in the previous three months, a fact she attributed to having recently become a mother. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Conostylis vaginata, commonly known as sheath conostylis, is a rhizomatous, tufted perennial, grass-like plant or herb in the family Haemodoraceae, and is endemic to the south of Western Australia. It has much-branched stems, grass-like leaves and yellow flowers arranged at the base of the leaves.\n\n\n== Description ==\nConostylis vaginata is a rhizomatous, tufted, perennial grass-like plant or herb. Its leaves are flattened elliptical, 70–100 mm (2.8–3.9 in) long and 0.7–1 mm (0.028–0.039 in) wide and glabrous. The flowers are sessile and borne in pairs at the base of the leaves, each flower 10–13 mm (0.39–0.51 in) long with a bract 3.0–3.5 mm (0.12–0.14 in) long at the base. The perianth is yellow with six more or less equal tepals and six stamens, the anthers 0.4–2 mm (0.016–0.079 in) long and the style 7–10 mm (0.28–0.39 in) long. Flowering occurs in September or October.\n\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\nConostylis vaginata was first formally described in 1846 by Stephan Endlicher in Lehmann's Plantae Preissianae. The specific epithet (vaginata) means \"sheathed\", referring to the bracts.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThis species of conostylis grows in sand, loam or clay on sand dunes and in winter-wet areas in the Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest and Mallee bioregions of southern Western Australia.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nConostylis vaginata is listed as \"not threatened\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.\n\n\n== References ==",

The song is performed by American singer-songwriter Alicia Keys.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nIn June 2023, Keys announced she had written her first jukebox musical Hell's Kitchen inspired by her own life and career in New York City. The play features some of Keys's best known songs, as well as new music written by Keys specifically for the play: \"River,\" \"Seventeen,\" and \"Kaleidoscope\".\nThe Off-Broadway musical ran from October 24, 2023, to January 14, 2024, as part of The Public Theater's 2023–24 season.

The song was official released the lead single from the Broadway musical soundtrack album on March 22, 2024.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nIn an interview for Entertainment Weekly Keys explained the meaning of the song and its composition process:\"It's that feeling when everything is spectacular and there's this moment that becomes illuminated. \"Kaleidoscope\" was one of those where we knew that it wanted to feel joyful and fun. It started one way, and as we went on, we realized, \"You know what? We need a whole dance.\" So, how are we going to add this increased musicality so that they can be feeling that essence of this kaleidoscopic feeling? Each time it grows and grows and grows.\"\n\n\n== Live performance ==\nThe song was firstly performed during Hell's Kitchen's Off-Broadway premiere on October 24, 2023, at The Public Theater. On March 22, 2024, Alicia Keys performed the song with the musical lead actress Maleah Joi Moon and the casts at the The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\n\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\nAdapted from Kaleidoscope liner notes.\nPersonnel\n\nWritten by Ben Billions, Breyan Isaac, Alicia Keys, Gamal Kosh Lewis\nProduced by Breyan Isaac and Alicia Keys\nCo-produced by Adam Blackstone\nLead vocals: Alicia Keys\nBackground vocals: Maleah Joi Moon, Chad Carstarphen, Vanessa Ferguson, Jakeim Hart, Jackie Leon, Lamont Walker II, Rema Webb, Nyseli Vega\nEngineered by Dave Kutch, Ann Mincieli and Brendan Morawski\nAssistant engineer: Frank Holland, Steven Tejeda and Roberto Regeiro\nMixed by Ken Lewis\n\n\n== References ==",

Azemmour, strategically situated along the coast, attracted the attention of the kings of Fez and Mequinez, who sought to expand their dominion in the region.\n\n\n== Preparation ==\nAnticipating the imminent threat, Portuguese leaders in Azemmour and Safim, including João de Meneses, Martim Afonso de Melo Coutinho, and Nuno Fernandes de Ataíde, coordinated their efforts to defend against the impending assault. They gathered their forces and sought support from local allies to bolster their defenses.\n\n\n== The Battle ==\nWhen the kings of Fez and Mequinez dispatched their alcaides with a substantial force of cavalry and infantry to lay siege to Azamor, the Portuguese and their allies launched a preemptive strike. Despite being outnumbered, they fought valiantly, engaging the enemy alcaides in fierce combat.\n\n\n== Outcome ==\nThe Battle of the Alcaides culminated in victory for the Portuguese and their allies. The enemy alcaides were routed, with one killed in action and the other forced to retreat. This triumph bolstered Portuguese control over Azemmour and thwarted the ambitions of Fez and Mequinez in the region.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe Battle of the Alcaides stands as a testament to the courage and resilience of the Portuguese defenders and their local allies. It secured Portuguese interests in North Africa and contributed to the stability of the region during a period of intense geopolitical competition.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPortuguese conquest of Tangier\nMoroccan-Portuguese conflicts\nBattle of Azemmour\nBattle of Mamora (1515)\nBattle of Tednest\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Gata Only\" is a song by Chilean singers FloyyMenor and Cris MJ. The solo version by the latter was independently released on 21 December 2023, with the duet version being released on 2 February 2024. The former and Christopher Álvarez (Cris MJ) wrote and produced the song. Following its virality on TikTok, it peaked at number 48 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and appeared on international song charts.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nFloyyMenor told Billboard that he wrote \"Gata Only\" between performances in a different region in Chile. Álvarez, who is known for his first hit single \"Una Noche en Medellín\", also told them:\n\n[FloyyMenor's] flow was similar to mine. I decided to support him and do the song with him. I worked on [a new version of] the track in my house. Gave it all my love. We did a new music video, we mixed it. I added second voices. He was very excited.\n\nA day after the February 2024 release of \"Gata Only\" and its music video, it received negative comments by users, who pointed out that Álvarez's part had too much echo and thought it sounded like it was made with artificial intelligence. Álvarez took to Instagram that the duet version of the song would be deleted and replaced with a version sung by FloyyMenor only. After being convinced by his fans, the duet version stayed on platforms, where it became trending in the singers' native country Chile days later.\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nIn the United States, \"Gata Only\" debuted at number 98 on the Billboard Hot 100, and would peak at number 48 in its fourth week. On the Hot Latin Songs chart, it debuted at number 46 and eventually peaked atop the chart in its seventh week, dethroning Xavi's \"La Diabla\" after it stayed at the position for 14 total weeks and also becoming the first Chilean song since 1999 to reach the chart's top 10. In its third week, \"Gata Only\" peaked at number four on the Latin Digital Song Sales chart, and peaked atop the Latin Streaming Songs chart on the issue dated 13 April 2024.\n\"Gata Only\" reached the top 10 on the Billboard Global 200 (10) and Billboard Global Excl. US (6) charts. In both singers' native Chile, it debuted atop the Chile Songs chart. It also reached the top 10 on other Latin American charts, including Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, Mexico, and Peru. The song peaked at number four on Spain's Top 100 singles chart, and was also certified Platinum.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Her band \"Namibian Tales\" include San music influences.\n\n\n== Life ==\nVranckx was born in 1987 in the Namibian capital of Windhoek. Her elder brother Ernst Vranckx is also a musician. Her heritage is Belgian and Namibian although she spent her childhood mainly in the Netherlands, but she always wanted investigate her heritage from her Ndonga mother. She took her first degree studying anthropology at Leiden University and then went on to a master's degree in musicology.\nIn 2012 and 2013, she was competing in band competitions in Belgium and in Namibia and in the following year she was in the final of the Radio France International Discovery Award competition.\nIn 2015, she and Shahin During formed a musical group called The Namibian Tales to play the music of Namibia. They were joined by Debby Korfmacher and Bence Huszar from Germany and Hungary. The quartet's debut album Itaala was released in the following year and it was recognised as a \"Best World Music Album\" in the Netherlands by Mixed World Music. Writing the songs had been difficult because of their eclectic background. The final sound included Namibian music, Huszar's cello and the work they had done with San musicians. Vranckx worked with the San people as an anthropologist - they are one of the oldest surving cultures.\nIn 2019, she formed a band which they named Miss Catharsis. She identifies herself as a black queer woman and her new group excluded any white or male musicians.\nThe Dutch presenter Jan Douwe Kroeske introduced a live session of Miss Catharsis in June 2022.\nIn 2024, she was in Namibia where she and others had put together work based around a drum from Museum am Rothenbaum in Hamburg. The work finishes with an all-night show at the Goethe-Institut in Windhoek.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2008 Townsville City Council election was held on 15 March 2008 to elect a mayor and 12 councillors to the City of Townsville. The election was held as part of the statewide local elections in Queensland, Australia.\nThe election saw the Australian Labor Party, which had controlled the council for 32 years − the longest-serving Labor administration in Australia − defeated in a landslide by the conservative Team Tyrell, which won all but one of the councillor positions. Incumbent mayor Tony Mooney was among the ALP members defeated.\nAs of 2024, this was the last time the ALP contested a Townsville City Council election.\n\n\n== Background ==\nTownsville City Council had been controlled by Labor since 1976. Tony Mooney had served as mayor since 1989, when he succeeded Mike Reynolds. At the previous election in 2004, Mooney won 73.56% of the primary vote and 80% of the two-candidate-preferred vote.\nIn 2007, the Queensland state government engaged in a programme of local government reform, focused on amalgamating local government areas (LGAs) across Queensland. It was recommended that the City of Thuringowa merge with the City of Townsville to form a new, larger council. Although there was some controversy, the merger ultimately took place, with the City of Thuringowa ceasing to exist on 15 March 2008 (the date of the local elections).\n\n\n== Candidates ==\nLes Tyrell, Thuringowa's mayor of 17 years, chose to contest the Townsville mayoral election, leading the Team Tyrell ticket. Incumbent Independent Liberal councillor David Crisafulli ran on the ticket in partnership with Tyrell as a deputy mayoral candidate.\nThe Greens led a ticket called \"Community Voices\", although only three out of eight candidates (including mayoral candidate Jenny Stirling) were Greens members.\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n=== Mayor ===\n\n\n=== Councillors ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Yakan, also known as the Yakani, Yakanye, Yakaŋ, the Yakan water cult, or Allah Water, was a religious movement that was active in Uganda among the Lugbara people, starting in 1890. The group was suppressed by the British Protectorate due to allegations they had a conspiracy against colonial rule. They are popularly remembered as a colonial resistance group.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe time period of 1890-1919 was difficult for the Lugbara people, with several raids from other groups and epidemics occurring.\n\n\n== Beliefs ==\nThe group was an anti-colonial alternative medicine congregation, centered around distributing \"water of Yakan\", infused with a psychedelic daffodil plant locally known as Kamiojo. The drug is known to cause hallucinations, as well as feelings of elation and frenzy when taken in large amounts. Writer George Ivan Smith described it as the \"LSD of Central Africa\". The group members would perform their rites around a planted pole, called dini (a term used more broadly to refer to religion in Lugbara).\nThe group has also been described as primarily wishing for independence, with Jack Driberg saying the medical aspect was secondary to the desire for revolution among the members.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group first appeared in 1890. The administration of the Protectorate of Uganda first encountered the Yakan group in 1919, in the West Nile District. The group was associated with a man named Rembe, who was most active in spreading the group in Lugbaraland from 1914 to 1920.\nThe movement was repressed by British colonial authorities who judged it as a \"coordinated conspiracy\" and challenge against their rule. The British viewed the Yakan as being a source of the resistance to forced labor, sending troops with machine guns in to disrupt the \"rebellion\". They also deported 15 chiefs (who were first appointed by colonial forces), before deporting eight more the next year; the evidence for doing this was disputed, and the Attorney General of the Protectorate of Uganda eventually concluded that there was no evidence of anything beyond the fact that \"'Allah Water' appears to be a particularly intoxicating drink\". However, the Attorney General was overruled and they were deported anyway.\nUgandan dictator Idi Amin's mother, Aate, was a member of the group. The Yakan movement was later described as having an effect on Amin's preferred types of torture techniques. The Amin family instead claimed that \"the Yakanye Order\" was an African secret society that used magic to start and win wars.\nThe group has been remembered as a colonial resistance group.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nAllen, Tim (July 1991). \"Understanding Alice: Uganda's Holy Spirit Movement in Context\".

        "content": "Not to be confused with Simeon bar Isaac, uncle of Rashi.\nRabbi Simeon bar Isaac bar Avon of Mainz (also known as Rabbi Shimon ben Yitzchak, Rabbi Simeon the Great, (Hebrew: שמעון בן יצחק; c. 950 - c. 1020) was a rabbi, Kabbalist, scholar, and poet. He was a contemporary of Rabbi Gershom Me’or HaGolah. He is often referred to as “the Great” due to his vast knowledge in all areas of Torah.\n\n\n== Life ==\nRabbi Simeon the Great hailed from one of the prominent Ashkenazi families. He was the grandson of Rabbi Avun the Great and studied under Rabbi Meshullam bar Kalonymus. In the book “Or Zarua,” it is mentioned that Rabbi Meshullam directed a legal matter to him, but Rabbi Simeon, due to his young age, declined to decide on it. He was likely a humble individual. His piyyutim (liturgical poems) often emphasize the virtue of humility.\nIn the memorial register of the Mainz community, it is noted that “Rabbi Simeon bar Isaac toiled for the communities and illuminated the eyes of the exiles with his piyyutim.”\nAccording to folk legend, his son Elchanan was abducted at a young age and raised in a monastery. Later, he became Pope Andreas. Upon discovering his true identity, he abandoned Christianity and was eventually martyred by the Crusaders. However, this legend lacks clear sources, and the chronology does not align – the First Crusade occurred over seventy years after Rabbi Simeon's passing.\nAmong his students were Rabbi Yakar, the father of Rabbi Yaakov ben Yakar, and Rabbi Eliezer the Great, son of Yitzchak.\nRabbi Yechiel Heilprin cites an old book that Rabbi Simeon passed away three days before the decrees of 1096 (Takkanot Tittnach).\n\n\n== Piyyutim ==\nRabbi Simeon laid the foundation for Ashkenazi piyyutim and was one of the few Ashkenazi poets who wrote extensively. Many of his piyyutim are included in the Ashkenazi prayer cycle, such as “Kedushataot” for Rosh Hashanah, Shavuot, and Shevi’i shel Pesach. Additionally, he composed numerous selichot (penitential prayers), some of which are recited during the month of Elul and the Ten Days of Repentance. His piyyutim were influenced by Ashkenazi mystical traditions.\nFor the High Holy Days, he authored “Melech Amon Ma’arach,” and the “Karov” section of the “Ametz Koach” piyyut, both recited during the second day of Rosh Hashanah. The “Karov” section includes the refrain “Shemo mi’Yisrael” (His name is from Israel).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Singer, Isidore; et al., eds.

        "content": "Mark Stevenson (born February 10, 1964) is an Australian epidemiologist, author, and academic. He is a professor of Urban Transport and Public Health at The University of Melbourne, where he directs the Transport, Health, and Urban Systems Research Lab. Additionally, he serves as an International Scholar at Tongji University, while also working as an Advisor for injury to the Director General of the World Health Organization and Chief Scientist of Urban Analytica.\nStevenson's research encompasses epidemiology pertaining to both transport safety and public health. He has authored over 300 publications, including The Scientific Basis of Injury Prevention and Control. In addition, he has served as an advisor on policy matters for both Australian federal and state governments. For his work on injury prevention in Australia, he received both the Australian National Road Safety Award and the Australian Injury Prevention Network Award.\nStevenson was appointed a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Health and Medical Sciences in 2022 and a Lifetime Fellow of the Australasian College of Road Safety. He served as an Associate Editor of Injury Prevention.\n\n\n== Education and early career ==\nStevenson completed his undergraduate studies in New Zealand. He then completed a Postgraduate Diploma in Health Science majoring in Epidemiology and Biostatistics from Curtin University in 1987, followed by a Master of Public Health in 1988, and held positions as Senior Lecturer, Lecturer, and Senior Tutor at the School of Public Health at Curtin University from 1989 to 1995. He graduated with a Doctor of Philosophy from The University of Western Australia (UWA) in 1995 and served his Postdoctoral Fellowship at Harvard School of Public Health.\n\n\n== Career ==\nStevenson assumed the role of Senior Lecturer and Head of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Curtin University in 1997, later moving to UWA, where he served as Associate Professor and Director of the Injury Research Centre until 2003. Following this, he served as a professor of Injury Prevention at The University of Sydney and subsequently served as a Professor and Director at the Accident Research Centre at Monash University from 2010 to 2015. Since 2018, he has served as an International Scholar at Tongji University in Shanghai and is a professor of Urban Transport and Public Health at the University of Melbourne, an appointment he holds across the Melbourne Schools of Design, Engineering, and Population and Global Health, and is the director of the Transport, Health, and Urban Systems Research Lab there as well.\nStevenson served as an Epidemiologist at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1998, and held the position of Senior Director of Research and Development at The George Institute for Global Health in Sydney, where he also directed the Injury and Trauma Care Division. From 2007 to 2022, he held National Health & Medical Research Council Research Fellowships. Since 2008, he has served as an advisor for injury to the director general of the World Health Organization and also holds the appointment of Chief Scientist and co-founder of Urban Analytica a data analytics company focused on sustainable transport solutions.\n\n\n== Research ==\nStevenson has concentrated his research efforts on increasing public awareness of transportation safety, with a particular focus on preventing road injuries in urban settings and implementing transport policies to promote population health.\n\n\n=== Transport safety ===\nStevenson's highly cited publications and advocacy efforts have influenced transport and public health policies, prompting legislative changes. He conducted a large-scale study on mobile phone use while driving, revealing a three-fold increased crash risk across all driver demographics which led to legislative changes in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, USA, and UK. From 2007 to 2013, he led a case-control study on sleepiness, sleep disorders, and the work environment in heavy vehicle crashes, influencing the Australian Government's Road Safety Remuneration Bill 2011 and Fair Work Legislation Amendment Bill 2023 to mitigate driver risk-taking behaviors. His advocacy, including media appearances and opinion editorials, led to the implementation of graduated driver licensing schemes (GLS) with peer passenger and night driving restrictions across a number of Australian States. He also led a study on reducing driving behaviors contributing to crashes by providing individualized real-time feedback via a smartphone app, along with financial incentives.\n\n\n=== Injury prevention ===\nStevenson emphasized the role of injury as a primary cause of death and disability worldwide prioritizing comprehension of essential scientific foundations for effective harm mitigation in his book titled The Scientific Basis of Injury Prevention and Control. In his study on the aftermath of the May 2008 earthquake in Wenchuan, he highlighted the widespread occurrence of injuries, attributing them to significant loss of life and productivity, proposing low-cost prevention measures to deal with the public health issue of injury-related mortality and morbidity in China. In addition, he presented an overview of the injury severity score (ISS) and the new injury severity score (NISS), illustrated their statistical properties through descriptive analysis, revealing a positively skewed distribution with no improvement in skewness through transformation.\nStevenson's 2003 study was the first to demonstrate an almost 2-fold increased risk of child drowning in 3-sided (where the house acted as a barrier) versus 4-sided (isolated) fenced swimming pools. These findings influenced legislative changes regarding isolation pool fencing and were cited in the WHO's and UNICEF's World Report on Child Injury Prevention as key evidence for the effectiveness of isolation pool fencing in preventing child drowning.\n\n\n=== Public health ===\nStevenson has contributed to epidemiological studies focused on identifying risk factors that promote health. He researched, with colleagues, the association between antibiotics and hospital-acquired Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, highlighting the gaps in research because of incorrect control groups and emphasizing the need for well-designed studies to identify true risk factors. In collaborative efforts, he proposed eight interventions for healthier, more sustainable cities through urban planning, advocating for multisector leadership prioritizing health and livability. Employing a health impact assessment framework to analyze the effects of alternative land-use and transport policies, his research also showcased how the transition toward compact cities promotes health benefits in diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease.\nOn September 6, 2020, Stevenson's research lab presented modeling to the Victorian Premier, outlining a roadmap for managing the second wave of the COVID-19 crisis. It emphasized the significant impact of the chosen trigger for easing public health restrictions on the risk of another lockdown by Christmas. These recommendations were adopted by the governments of Australia and New Zealand.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2001 – Award for Achievement in Injury Prevention Research, Australian Injury Prevention Network\n2008 – Lifetime Fellow, Australasian College of Road Safety\n2022 – Fellow, Australian Academy of Health and Medical Sciences\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Selected books ===\nThe Scientific Basis of Injury Prevention and Control (2004) ISBN 978-0957861794\n\n\n=== Selected articles ===\nStevenson, M., Segui-Gomez, M., Lescohier, I., Di Scala, C., & McDonald-Smith, G.

        "content": "The Pornographer is the fourth novel by Irish author John McGahern, first published in 1979. This critically acclaimed work delves into the complex themes of human relationships, sexuality, and mortality with a nuanced narrative that intertwines the mundane with the profound. The Pornographer delves into Michael's dual roles as a writer of pornographic fiction and his struggles with love and sensitivity.\n\n\n== Plot summary ==\nThe Pornographer tells the story of Michael, a writer of pornographic fiction living in Dublin, who crafts a world of idealized sex through his characters Colonel Grimshaw and Mavis Carmichael. Despite his proficiency in depicting eroticism, Michael struggles with his personal relationships, particularly with an older woman, Josephine, who falls in love with him.\nMichael's insensitivity towards Josephine's affection contrasts sharply with his tender care for his dying aunt in the hospital. Meanwhile, his employer, Maloney, a failed poet and prominent figure in the pornography industry, gradually gains influence over Michael's tumultuous life.\nThe narrative explores the juxtaposition of opposites, with themes of sex and death interwoven throughout. Michael, a thirty-year-old alcoholic, navigates through his emotionally indifferent existence, grappling with Josephine's pregnancy and the societal expectations of 1970s Ireland.\nAs Michael reflects on his life and relationships, he begins to question what it means to truly engage with life and to do right by others\n\n\n== Critical reaction ==\nThe novel was met with critical acclaim, praised for its compelling portrayal of an isolated existential hero navigating the complexities of Dublin life. Colm Tóibín, reflecting on the novel, expressed its impact, stating: So when The Pornographer appeared me and my colleagues devoured it. This isolated existential hero producing his pornography in Dublin was electrifying for us. Certainly much more so than, say, the new Martin Amis novel, which was a big turnaround.Alice Adams of The New York Times, praised it as \"an often amusing, sometimes sexy, and always wonderfully written example\" that subverts expectations. Adams notes that the novel's central fantasy provides a contrast to readers' own untidy fantasies, offering relief from the incomprehensibility of their dreams. She highlights the novel's departure from traditional narratives where the humor or pathos derives from the contrast between outer and inner lives, suggesting that The Pornographer offers a unique exploration of secret lives that may or may not be exposed through collision with reality.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "A Spy on Mother Midnight (1748) is an erotic epistolary tale published in three chapbooks. Its narrator, Richard F------, disguises himself as a woman in order to have sex clandestinely with a series of women. The full title page of the book reads: A Spy on Mother Midnight: Or, The Templar Metamorphos'd. Being a Lying-In Conversation. With a Curious Adventure. In a Letter from a young Gentleman in the Country, to his Friend in Town. Although the book was originally written as pornography, it is now studied for its depiction of eighteenth-century English gender and sexuality, especially its depictions of dildos, cross-dressing, and homoeroticism.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nRichard F------, called Dick, is an urban rake who has spent months pursuing a prudish country girl, Maria. He cross-dresses to assume the persona of \"Miss Polly,\" a disguise he finds easy and enjoyable throughout the book. He follows Maria to an isolated country inn, accompanied by a friend, Nancy, who acts as his maid. Maria is at the inn to attend her cousin's lying-in (i.e., her late pregnancy, birth, and post-natal recovery). \"Miss Polly\" is also invited to the lying-in, where Dick is shocked by the women's sexually frank conversation. That evening, Maria invites \"Miss Polly\" to share her bed, a common practice for travellers of the same sex. Dick sees an ivory dildo in Maria's things, revealing that she is not as prudish as she had seemed. \"Miss Polly\" suggests using the dildo to pretend that Maria is having sex with Dick; he substitutes his own penis, which initially surprises but then delights Maria. \nIn the morning, Maria is worried because Nancy knows they had sex. Dick defends Nancy's character, telling the story of how she was seduced and abandoned, and then turned to sex work. Dick and Maria enjoy sex a second night. More guests arrive at the inn, including Maria's cousin Fanny, who attracts Dick. Maria is called away to visit an ill relative elsewhere, and Fanny shares a bed with \"Miss Polly\" instead. Fanny asks for a massage of a sore spot on her thigh, which Dick takes as an excuse to finger her. When Fanny realises he is a man, she immediately rejects him, but decides not to call for help so that her cousin Maria will not face a scandal for sharing his room the past two nights.\n\nDick resolves to talk Fanny into having sex. He reassures her that there is no risk of pregnancy, because he has condoms. He puts one on. Fanny verbally protests, but he embraces and penetrates her, which ultimately inspires pleasure. They continue to have sex over the next two or three days. Meanwhile, Nancy notices an attractive housemaid, Sally, and wagers Dick that he can't resist having sex with her. Nancy invites Sally to share her bed; Dick takes Nancy's place, and they have sex. When Dick returns to Fanny's bed, she laughs at him for losing the bet, and reveals that she had taken Sally's place herself. The next guests at the inn are a Methodist preacher and a young squire, both of whom pursue \"Miss Polly.\" \"Miss Polly\" seduces both men into planning an assignation, allowing Dick and Nancy to trick the preacher into being locked in the privy overnight, and to trick the squire into marrying Nancy. Nancy, the squire, and \"Miss Polly\" depart for London in good cheer.\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nThe story was published anonymously, in three parts. Part two was titled A Continuation of Mr. F--------'s Adventures in Petty-Coats: Being the Second Part of The Spy on Mother Midnight, and part three was A Further Continuation of Mr. F------'s Adventures in Petty-Coats: Being the Third and Last Part of the Spy on Mother Midnight. Part one was advertised for sale for nine shillings in the February 1748 issue of The London Magazine, and part two was advertised the next month for one shilling.\nThe story was also sold as part of The Temple of Fame: or, the Sc—d—l—s [i.e., Scandalous] Chronicle for the Year 1748, but had no re-issues in new editions in the eighteenth century, suggesting a relatively small audience or lack of commercial success at the time. It did not gain attention until a modern interest in the history of sexuality, especially queer sexuality. An excerpt was reprinted in Secret Sexualities: A Sourcebook of 17th and 18th Century Writing (1997) among its \"Sapphic Texts\", and the full work was included in Eighteenth-Century British Erotica (2004).\n\n\n== Style ==\nThe story is told through six fictitious letters, addressed to Dick's friend Jack. It is noted for its light-hearted tone, which makes no apologies for its content. Like most English erotica of the period, it employs metaphor and allusion rather than dwelling in detail on the movement of specific body parts. Its main narrative technique is to build up detailed anticipation during the narrator's flirtation and approach, and then to suddenly stop at the moment of consummation and leave the reader to imagine the rest. When Dick and Maria first have sex, for example, Dick describes embracing Maria, and then penetration is implied by Maria's exclamation of surprise when she realises that Dick's penis is not her dildo. This tendency to allusively gloss over sexual acts distinguishes A Spy on Mother Midnight in the period as erotica rather than pornography, which (especially in French works) would be more descriptive. Often, the metaphorical language for sexual acts relies on punning. Especially when Dick describes meeting Maria at church, the puns play on religious language. Repurposing religious language for double entendres was another common rhetorical technique of eighteenth-century erotic texts, which often lampooned religious morality.\n\n\n== Major themes ==\n\n\n=== Cross-dressing as social boundary-crossing ===\nIn Mother Midnight, the introduction of a disguise would have signalled the book's erotic content to eighteenth-century readers, further emphasized by the subtitles of the two continuations, \"Adventures in Petty-Coats.\" Masquerades and costumes were, in general, associated with social and sexual license in eighteenth-century fiction. At public masked costume parties, the plausible deniability of anonymity allowed both men and women unusual social freedom. Dick's costume allows him to cross boundaries of both gender and class, as \"Miss Polly\" is not a member of the gentry. As a result, the story presents these social categories as potentially fluid.\n\n\n=== Sexual libertinism and homoeroticism ===\nThe primary theme of the book is an embrace of sexual libertinism. Unlike works like The Libertine (1807), which ends with its titular libertine being swallowed into hell, the ending of Mother Midnight does not punish any of the characters. The sexual encounters are presented as non-violent and enjoyable for all parties, with no negative consequences. Moreover, none of Dick's sexual partners are ultimately restrained by marriage. These factors were not guaranteed in eighteenth-century pornography, and reflect this work's enthusiasm for sex.\nA Spy on Mother Midnight is especially notable for extending its lighthearted and permissive attitude to the narrator's cross-dressing and flirtations with men. Other literature of the period is almost universally derogatory of \"mollies\" and men who cross-dress. Even in pornography, any discussion of sodomy would be followed by harsh condemnations insisting that all sodomites will be punished. Dick, however, brags about how easily his feminine features allow him to cross-dress, and intentionally stokes the lust of his male suitors at the end of the work. The narrator directly addresses the fellow libertine to whom his letters are written, drawing attention to the fact that the expected reader of his escapades is also male and creating an entirely homoerotic scenario in which a man describes his seduction of another man for the titillation of a third man. Through the all-female dialogue at the lying-in, the story also provides an extensive and detailed discussion of the relative attractiveness of various kinds of penis. Taken together, these factors present male homoeroticism as non-threatening and even fun, while remaining sufficiently subtextual that no homophobic disavowals are necessary.\n\nIn addition to its male homoerotic subtext, A Spy on Mother Midnight is also known for its female homoerotic text. All of Dick's sexual access to women relies on their belief that he, too, is a woman. The secret female-only sexual world that he enters is most prominently represented by Maria's dildo. In eighteenth-century pornography, the dildo is a material symbol of lesbian desire, and potentially threatening. The narrator's act of substituting his penis for Maria's dildo enacted a recurring eighteenth-century fantasy of \"outdoing and tricking lesbians whose use of a dildo threatens male power.\" Afterward, Dick lectures Maria that their sex was \"less sinful, and indisputably more natural, than ... she heretofore had Recourse to,\" reinforcing a heterosexual morality. At the same time, the narrator's identification with Maria's dildo reflects his own gender transgressions in entering female spaces. He fantasizes about first destroying and then becoming Maria's dildo, describing a dissolution of his status as man and heterosexual in pursuit of the secret inner world of female pleasure.\n\n\n=== The sexual power of midwives ===\n\"Mother Midnight\"—part of the book's title, and the name of one of its characters—was a cant term for a sexualized midwife, often used for a stock character. Birth and midwifery were recurring themes in eighteenth-century pornography; erotic texts might sell themselves as midwifery manuals. When A Spy on Mother of Midnight was published in the middle of the eighteenth century, midwifery was increasingly practiced by male midwives and physicians. A female midwife was therefore a potentially disreputable figure, notable for her sexual knowledge. In fiction, midwives were typically characterized as bawdy, and frequently as sexual procurers. The Mother Midnight in the novel, like other fictional midwives with this name, uses her position of privileged knowledge to exert power over men. She instructs young women on the standards they should expect from their husbands' sexual performance, and she assists in multiple sexual deceptions. In the story's opening birth scene, for example, Mother Midnight knows that the mother's husband is not the father of her baby, and conceals this disruption of the family line.\nThe midwife is also the figurehead for the lying-in, a female-only social gathering of friends and family who arrive to support a new mother before and after birth. Because the lying-in was intimate, private, and barred to men, some men viewed it as a tantalizing mystery. In molly houses, men would sometimes cross-dress to act out parodic birth and lying-in scenes, further associating the lying-in with homoeroticism.\n\n\n== See also ==\n18th century erotic literature\nVenus in the Cloister\nMemoirs of a Woman of Pleasure\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Queen Jiang (Chinese: 姜王后) is a character from the Chinese classical novels The Investiture of the Gods (Fēngshén Yǎnyì) and The Story of King Wu Conquering Zhou and Bringing Peace (全相武王伐纣平话; Wǔwáng Fá Zhòu Pínghuà). As the first queen consort crowned by King Zhou of Shang, she was the daughter of the Eastern Duke, Jiang Huanzhu (伯侯姜桓楚; Dōngbǎi Hóu Jiāng Huánchǔ). She bore two sons, Yin Hong and Yin Jiao, with King Zhou. \nAfter Daji entered the palace, she plotted and ultimately caused the tragic death of Queen Jiang. After her death, Queen Jiang is deified as the Taiyin Star (太阴星), one of the Twelve Luminaries (群星正神; Qúnxīng Zhèngshén).\n\n\n== Legend ==\nAccording to historical records and surviving oracle bone inscriptions, Queen Jiang does not appear to have existed. It is believed that her prototype was Jiuhou Nü, who was a consort of King Zhou of Shang. She was the daughter of the leader of the Guifang, Jiuhou, and was presented to King Zhou through a political alliance. However, she was ultimately executed by King Zhou on charges of \"disliking lewdness\", and her father suffered the same fate with dismemberment. The tomb of Jiuhou Nü is located in present-day Qixian County, Hebi City, Henan Province, along the banks of the Qi River.\nIn Fengshen Yanyi , Queen Jiang was the daughter of the Eastern Duke, Jiang Huanchu. She was of extraordinary beauty and became the queen consort of King Zhou of Shang. She gave birth to two sons, Yin Jiao and Yin Hong. At that time, Daji, who was of bewitching beauty, had just been selected for the palace and was honored as the imperial concubine. She was not familiar with Jiang, but they became acquainted a few months later. Two years later, Jiang was crowned queen, which aroused Daji's jealousy. As a result, Daji launched a series of conspiracies to frame Queen Jiang.\nAfter being framed by Daji, Jiang was demoted to the status of imperial concubine by King Zhou of Shang and banished to the cold palace. In her solitude there, Daji gained favor, while Jiang endured loneliness. Despite Yin Jiao and Yin Hong, her two sons, informing King Zhou of Shang about everything, the king chose to heed Daji's slanderous words and disregarded his sons' counsel, opting instead to punish the two princes with beatings. Two months later, Lady Yin, the wife of Li Jing, spoke of Queen Jiang's virtues in front of King Zhou. Upon hearing this, King Zhou released Queen Jiang. That night, King Zhou of Shang reinstated Jiang as queen once again.\nOnce, under the influence of alcohol, Daji accompanied King Zhou in disguise for a patrol. After two hours, they returned on horseback. Later, in a fit of jealousy, Daji punished Queen Jiang with thirty lashes and sent her to the cold palace. To prove her innocence, Queen Jiang sent a messenger pigeon to Lady Yin, the wife of Li Jing. Upon receiving the message, Lady Yin rushed to the cold palace. When Lady Yin entered the cold palace, she saw Queen Jiang being gouged out of her eyes, so she went to stop her. However, Queen Jiang was already dead.  After the conclusion of the event, Daji slandered King Zhou by accusing Queen Jiang of plotting rebellion, attempting to assassinate King Zhou, and assisting her father, Duke Jiang Huanchu, in usurping the throne of Shang from the Zhou dynasty. Subsequently, King Zhou enfeoffed Daji as queen. After Queen Jiang's death, her two sons, Yin Jiao and Yin Hong, were marginalized by Daji and eventually slandered to death by King Zhou. When Jiang Ziya was naming gods, Queen Jiang was appointed as the Taiyin Star.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nPortrayed by Yuan Quan in 2023 Chinese film Creation of the Gods I: Kingdom of Storms\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Kingdom of Georgia from 1256 to 1329, sometimes called the Kingdom of Eastern Georgia (Georgian: აღმოსავლეთ საქართველოს სამეფო, romanized: aghmosavlet sakartvelos samepo) was the official prolongation of the Kingdom of Georgia from 1256 to 1329, but limited in its rule to the geographical areas of central and eastern Georgia, while the western part of the country temporarily seceded to form the Kingdom of Western Georgia under its own line of kings. The secession followed a transitional period when the rule of the Kingdom of Georgia was jointly assumed by the cousins David VI and David VII from 1246 to 1256. The entity split into two parts when David VI, revolting from the Mongol hegemony, seceded in the western half of the kingdom and formed the Kingdom of Western Georgia in 1256. David VII was relegated to the rule of Eastern Georgia. During his reign, Eastern Georgia went into further decline under the Mongol overlordship.\n\n\n== Mongol conquest ==\nSince the 1220s, the Kingdom of Georgia had to contend with the numerous Mongol invasions of Genghis Khan and his successors, the Ilkhanids. Following a disastrous campaign, the Kingdom of Georgia recognized defeat against the Mongols and had to accept submission through the 1239 treaty. \nBetween 1236 and 1256, before the creation of the Il-Khanate, Caucasia was placed under the military governorship of Chormaqan, and divided into 5 vilayets (provinces): Georgia (Gurjistan), Greater Armenia, Shirvan, Arran, and Mughan, with Armenian principalities becoming fragmented and essentially independent. Georgia was partionned into 8 Mongol tümen, with each tümen ordered to supply 10,000 soldiers. After 1256, Armenia was directly incorporated into the Il-Khanate founded by Hulegu.\n\n\n== Joint rule (1246-1256) ==\nIn 1246, the Mongol Empire confirmed the cousins David VII and David VI as joint kings of King of Georgia by the Mongol Empire, effectively laying ground for a division of the Georgian kingdom. \nThe \"two Davids\", as incumbents for the throne of Georgia, David VI and David VII, attended the enthronement ceremony of the Mongol Khan Güyük on 24 August 1246, near the Mongol capital at Karakorum, together with a large number of foreign ambassadors: the Franciscan friar and envoy of Pope Innocent IV, John of Plano Carpini and Benedict of Poland; Grand Duke Yaroslav II of Vladimir; the brother of the king of Armenia and historian, Sempad the Constable; the future Seljuk Sultan of Rum, Kilij Arslan IV; and ambassadors of the Abbasid Caliph Al-Musta'sim and Ala ud din Masud of the Delhi Sultanate. all bearing homage, tribute, and presents. This event was related by the 13th century historian Juvayni:\n\nFrom Khitai there came emirs and officials; and from Transoxiana and Turkestan the emir Masʿud accompanied by grandees of that region. With the emir Arghun there came the celebrities and notables of Khorasan, Iraq, Lur, Azerbaijan and Shirvan. From Rum came Sultan Rukn al-Din and the Sultan of Takavor (Trebizond); from Georgia, the two Davits; from Aleppo, the brother of the Lord of Aleppo; from Mosul, the envoy of Sultan Badr al-Din Luʾluʾ; and from the city of Peace, Baghdad, the chief qadi Fakhr al-Din. There also came the Sultan of Erzurum, envoys from the Franks, and from Kerman and Fars also; and from ʿAla al-Din of Alamut, his governors in Quhistan, Shihab al-Din and Shams al-Din. And all this great assembly came with such baggage as befitted a court; and there came also from other directions so many envoys and messengers that two thousand felt tents had been made ready for them: there came also merchants with the rare and precious things that are produced in the East and the West.\nThe Mongols appointed David VII as ulu (\"senior\") ruler, while David VI was appointed narin (junior) ruler. The Mongols required the Georgians to provide 90,000 soldiers (calculated at 1/9th of the population), and the agriculture and economy were taxed. They reigned jointly throughout the country for almost a decade under Mongol control. However, the Mongol overlords began to impose heavy taxes on the inhabitants of the Caucasus, leading to numerous popular revolts, particularly in Shirvan.\n\nIn 1259, David VI, who was nicknamed Narin (meaning \"junior\" in Mongolian) by the Ilkhanid authorities, rebelled against his Mongol suzerain, although he did not drag his royal colleague into the rebellion. The Ilkhanate soon put an end to this revolt after a few short, bloody battles, while David VI managed to take refuge in western Georgia on a secret journey that took him through Armenia. Arriving in Kutaisi, one of the largest towns in western Georgia, he declared the secession of the domains west of the Likhi mountains, and was proclaimed King of the Kingdom of Western Georgia by the local nobility.\nWestern Georgia then became an independent kingdom, wishing to preserve Georgian culture outside the sphere of influence of the Mongol world. The Ilkhanate was preoccupied with its military campaign in Syria against certain Crusader states and Mamluk Sultanate and was content to increase the tributes imposed on eastern Georgia to rectify the difference in revenue following the loss of a large portion of the taxes from some of the richest Georgian provinces.\n\n\n== Secession (1256-1329) ==\n\nThe Kingdom of Eastern Georgia was under the direct authority of the Mongol ruler Hulagu Khan (r 1256–1265), founder of the Ilkhanate, and was considered as a vassal of the Īlkhānid state. The Mongols also took direct control of the Samtskhe region in southwestern Georgia, as an autonomous principality under Il-khanate rule.\nThe successive kings of Eastern Georgia from 1256 to 1329 were David VII, Demetrius II, David VIII, Vakhtang III and George V. \nAt times, Georgia became a battleground between rival Mongol authorities, and in 1265, Berke Khan, the ruler of the Golden Horde, ravaged Eastern Georgia from the north.\n\n\n=== Mongol control ===\nThe Mongol maintained control over the Eastern Georgian territory, by maintaining the original kingship within the original Bagratid family, while appointing their own supporters for the offices of the Atabeg (Governor General) and the Amirspasalar (Commander-in-Chief) of the army, as seen with the appointments of Sadun Artsruni (r.1272–1282) or his son Khutlubuga (r.1270–1293). Throughout the 13th century, the high offices Atabeg (Governor General) and Amirspasalar (Commander-in-Chief of the Georgian army) had been held by the Zakarids, but following the Mongol takeover of Eastern Georgia, the Mongol victors gave these offices to the \"renegade\" Sadun of Mankaberd in 1272. When Abaqa became the new Mongol ruler, Sadun received from him the title of Atabeg Amirspasalar for the Georgian Bagratid Kingdom. He was said to be close to the Mongols, and had been promoted by them: \"Sadun Artsruni was appointed as atabeg of Georgia by Abaqa Khan\". In his position, he especially controlled the policies of Eastern Georgia, which, while being ruled by Demetre II, remained pro-Mongol throughout.\nThe Mongols of the Il-Khanate also had a Military Governor or \"Viceroy\" of Georgia in place, such as Alinaq Noyan (–1289) and his successor Qurumushi (1289–1318).\n\n\n=== Military operations ===\nThe Eastern Georgians provided substancial military support to the Mongols: they supported the Siege of Baghdad in 1258, and the Mongol campaigns in Syria from 1259 into the 1260s, leading to thousands of casualties. Sadun Artsruni, future Atabeg for Eastern Georgia, is known to have accompanied Hulegu in his military campaigns in Syria in 1259, in the conquest of Sasun, and in the Siege of Aleppo (1260). But when in 1260 Hulegu Khan requested the presence of Georgians and Armenians for the Mongol invasions of the Levant, remembering the losses of his troops in the 1258 Siege of Baghdad, David Ulu rebelled. A large Mongol army led by General Arghun Aqa invaded Georgia from the south, inflicted a heavy defeat on David and Sargis I Jaqeli in a battle near Akhaldaba, and then brutally plundered the country. The Mongol campaign continued during the winter, and the following year the king was forced to flee to Imereti, which the Mongols failed to conquer. David's family was captured, and his wife Gvantsa was killed. Peace with the Mongols was achieved in 1262, when David Ulu returned to Tbilisi to reclaim his crown as a Mongol vassal, pledging allegiance to Hulegu, while David Narin only nominally recognized Mongol rule in Imereti. The reason for Hulegu's tolerance towards the rebel lies in the fact that since 1261, the Il-kan was at war with the Golden Horde, which was on a larger scale. \nThe territory of the Caucasus, and as part of it the Kingdom of Georgia itself, became the scene of war between Hulegu and the Khan of the Golden Horde Berke in the following years. David Ulu provided his support for the conflict between the Il-Khanate and the Golden Horde in 1263-1265. In 1263, King David's troops participated in the defense of the Siba fortress against the Golden Horde. In 1265, his troops, as the vanguard of the Ilkhanate army, defeated Berke and pushed his troops out of Shirvan. As Hulegu died in the same year, Berke began to prepare a major offensive. The following year, his army penetrated into Georgia, but the offensive was abruptly stopped due to the death of the khan in the vicinity of Tbilisi.\nIn 1270, David Ulu led Georgian and Armenian troops in support of the Mongol Abaqa against Tekuder, who had found refuge in Western Georgia.\nDemetrius II participated to all Mongol campaigns from 1275 to 1281. In 1277, 3000 Georgians founght with the Mongols against the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt in the battle of Abulistan. Georgian troops were present in great number at the Second Battle of Homs (1281). \nIn 1284, Georgian and Armenian troops had to participate in the dynastic conflict between the Il-Khanate ruler Tekuder and Arghun, with troops under the Vicery of Georgia Alinaq Noyan and under Tekuder himself.\nThe relationship was tumultuous: in 1289, King Demetrius II was executed by the Mongols, at the instigation of Khutlubuga. His son, the future David VIII, had to participate in the Mongol invasion of Anatolia in 1291-1292.\n\n\n=== Religious revolts ===\nThe Mongol Emir Nawrūz, son of Arghun Aqa, started to implement anti-Christian policies, in relation with the adoption of Islam by his ruler Ghazan. Suddenly, Christians and Jew were segregated against, and had to wear distinctive types of dresses. Churches were being destroyed throughout the Middle-East, but also in Georgia, at Siwnik‘, Somkhit and Kartli. These events provoked popular rebellions and threat of military uprisings against the Mongols. Because of this, Nawrūz was replaced by Qutlughshāh on the orders of Ghazan. Nawrūz then plotted against Ghazan, but was denounced with the help of the Armenian Princes Eachi Pŕoshian and Liparit Orbelian, and was finally executed.\nA unified Georgia was reestablished by George V of Georgia in 1329, as he reasserted royal control over the western part of Georgia through the astute usage of Mongol forces, and ultimately managed to expel the Mongols from Georgian lands. This coincided with a weakening of the Ilkhanate, which was engulfed in civil war in 1335-1344. Georgia would again suffer invasion at the hands of Timurlane from 1386 onward.\n\n\n== Art ==\nKhutlubuga was a patron for the murals at the Church of the Holy Sign, in the Haghpat Monastery, probably during his time as Amirspasalar in the 1280s. He appears in person, with the inscription of his name. He wear a wrap-around caftan with decorative inserts, and has a low triangular headgear. This is a very useful marker for the clothing styles and for the dating of works of art of the period. They are contemporary with the murals at Kobayr by the family of the Zakarids, nominal vassals of the Georgian crown.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nBai︠a︡rsaĭkhan, D.

        "content": "Ronnie Wavehill also known as Ronnie Wavehill Wirrpngayarri Jangala (c. 1936 – 20 May 2020) was a Gurindji stockman who was born at Wave Hill Station. He took part in the Wave Hill walk-off and he was a cultural storyteller, Indigenous cultural informant and singer.\n\n\n== Life in the Northern Territory ==\nWavehill was the son of Cracker Jarluyarri Jampin and Mariah Yakngarri Nangari and was one of seven children. He many years of his early childhood travelling through Gurinji Country, and further afield, with his grandparents by foot. They would travel hundreds of kilometres to follow seasonal ceremonial gatherings and connect with Country and Countrymen. This time with them, who were elders among his people, gave him Gurindji language proficiency significantly higher than many of his peers.\nIt was on one of the trips that Wavehill learnt the Wanjiwanji (Laka) songs that he brought to Wave Hill Station. This song came from Yawulyurru Tjapangarti, a Pintupi songman, and he shared it with dozens of language groups with the lyrics remaining unchanged. Wavehill remembers sharing this song and says if it:\n\nWith some to-do, I got up there and stood up in front of everyone. They had me stand up there in the middle to sing … All the Gurindji were amazed at me: they’d never seen such a small boy sing without shame. All the mob from the west were egging me on, ‘Go on, Jangala!’\nIn 1945, when Wavehill was 10 years old, Ronald and Catherine Berndt arrived for a visit to Wave Hill Station and reported the inhumane working and living conditions of the Aboriginal people living there; additionally they noted that children under 12, like Wavehill, were employed illegally as stockmen. \nWavehill continued working as a stockman, for no pay, until the Wave Hill walk-off, where he and his people protested not only their living and working conditions but also began their fight for Land Rights.\nAfter the successful strike Wavehill worked as a rubbish collector for the Daguragu and Kalkarindji local councils.\nIn the 1990s Wavehill began working with linguists, including Erika Charola and Felicity Meakins, and other researchers to share his knowledge of Gurinji language and culture. To do this he often worked alongside other Elders to produce publications. He was also a contributor to Native Title proceedings and Aboriginal Lands Trusts activities throughout the region.\nWavehill was also an informant regarding numerous massacres of Aboriginal people which had been recounted to him by previous generations; one of the names provided was Owen Cummins who he identified as someone who, in the \"eearly days\", had shot Aboriginal people the Wave Hill Station Massacre/s between 1920 and 1922.\nWavehill was quoted as saying of the Blackfellows Knob Massacre, at Tartarr, that:\n\n‘The ngumpin [Aboriginal people who had been butchering a beast] ran away southwards, away from Tartarr. They went downstream a bit and then out across the rocks. The kartiya [whitefellas] were chasing them on horseback, galloping like mad. The ngumpin stopped there in the dry creek and hooked up their spears. “Don’t go”, the kartiya boss was saying. “Don’t get close otherwise we’ll get speared.” They were frightened of the ngumpin. The horsemen never caught up to them, so a lot of them got away. A horse can gallop but those ngumpin were very good runners’.\nAlthough he remembered past atrocities he did not generalise his opinion of kartiya (non-Indigenous people) and he said that there \"were bad kartiya and good kartiya, bad ngumpin (Aboriginal people) and good ngumpin.\nWavehill died on 20 May 2020 on Gurinji Country and it was noted that his Dreaming was the Ngapa (Rain) Dreaming and it rained for three days on Gurinji Country after his death.\n\n\n== Select publications ==\nBilinarra, Gurindji and Malngin Plants and Animals (2012)\nGurindji to English Dictionary (2013)\nYijarni: True Stories from Gurindji Country (2016)\nMayarni-kari Yurrk: More Stories from Gurindji Country (2016)\nFor a full list see AustLit.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nWavehill was quoted by Pat Dodson in his censure motion against Fraser Anning following the Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Miriek people (Malay: Orang Miriek, Miriek: Jatti Miriek), also spelled Meirek or Mirek are an Austronesian ethnic group indigenous to Miri in eastern Sarawak, Malaysia. They are the autochthonous people of the city of Miri and its surrounding areas.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nAccording to Miriek folk story, the Mirieks originated from the territories of Apo Kayan people around Kayan river between modern day Kalimantan and Sarawak. The territorial expansion of the Kayans caused the Mirieks to migrate northwards into areas of Baram river before settled around Miri river (Likoh Miraik) on the northeastern coast of Sarawak in what is now modern day city of Miri.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nCulturally, the Mirieks have close ties with their Malay neighbours and share many similar cultures and lifestyle, which is why the Mirieks are originally classified as Malays and were only recognized as a distinct ethnic group by the Sarawakian government in 2022. They are traditionally farmers and fishermen with strong ties to the land of Miri before rapid urbanization of the city due to the discovery of oil. The rapid urbanization of Miri caused the traditional lands of Miriek people becoming more threatened by developers.\n\n\n== Languages ==\nThe Miriek language (Tuttot Miriek) belongs to the Berawan-Lower Baram branch of the Austronesian language family and is closely related to Berawan and Tutong languages. The language is considered endangered as younger generations prefer to speak Malay as their main language. There are efforts to revitalize the usage of Miriek and several books have been published in the language such as Bup Iddeh Itai and Panduan Bercakap Bahasa Jatti Miriek. \n\n\n== Religion ==\nMiriek people traditionally adhere to Sunni Islam due to its historical contacts with the Malay Sultanate of Brunei and played an important role in their ethnic identity. The Islamic elements of Miriek people can be seen in their clothes, culture and arts.\n\n\n== Sub-Ethnic Groups ==\nThere are two sub-ethnic groups within Miriek people that is;\n\nMiriek Bahut - Historically the Bahut Mirieks did not practiced mixed marriages and often live within their communities.\nMiriek Permaisuri - according to a local folktale, Permaisuri Mirieks are said to be the descendants of a Bahut Miriek woman named Timah and Tahir who is the son of Ratu Permaisuri from Sulawesi. They are more open to mix marriages with other ethnic groups which surrounds them.\nThe main difference between these two groups is mainly historical and today there is hardly any distinction between them.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External Links ==",

        "content": "Edmund Schuchardt (January 27, 1889 - September 10, 1972) was a German architect and interior designer in Dresden who was persecuted by the Nazis.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSchuchardt was born on January 27, 1889, in Leuben.\nAround 1910, he attended evening school at the Dresden School of Applied Arts together with Hermann Glöckner.\nFrom 1912 to 1917, Schuchardt was a master student with William Lossow and Oskar Menzel at the School of Applied Arts, and from 1919 to 1922 he was a student at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts with Heinrich Tessenow and Hans Poelzig.\nAfter 1930, he and his Jewish wife Fanny (née Dubliner) moved into an apartment in the Dürerbundhaus  in Dresden-Blasewitz, where they shared a floor with the family of brother-in-law Kurt Fiedler. At that time, the office of the Kunstwart and Dürerbund was still in the house. Schuchardt was last recorded as an architect with this address in the 1943/44 address book. The Dürerbundhaus was destroyed during the Bombing of Dresden on February 13, 1945 .\nBecause Schuchardt did not divorce his Jewish wife, the Nazis banned him from working and deported him to forced labor on November 9, 1944, in the Osterode mine, from which he was liberated by the American army. After the Second World War, the Schuchardt couple were recognized as victims of fascism (OdF).\nIn 1946, Schuchardt was represented at the Saxon Artists art exhibition. In 1948, he became Professor at the Hochschule für Werkkunst Dresden, the successor to the School of Applied Arts. Three years after the merger with the Academy of Fine Arts to form the Dresden University of Fine Arts (HfBK) in 1950, Schuchardt resigned from teaching. He died on September 10, 1972, in Wachwitz. Schuchardt and his wife were buried at the Loschwitz cemetery.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\nOne of Schuchardt's most important areas of work was interior design. He is best known for his involvement in the Dresden-Johannstadt synagogue. He was repeatedly represented at art exhibitions in Dresden with architectural designs and drawings.\n\nIn Rockau, he created the monument in memory of those who died in the First World War, and in Wachwitz he created the Hottenrothstrasse settlement.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Complete DreamWorks Albums is a 2015 box set of seven albums from American indie rock band Eels, released in the 1990s and 2000s: Beautiful Freak (1996), Electro-Shock Blues (1998), Daisies of the Galaxy (2000), Souljacker (2001), Electro-Shock Blues Show (2002, recorded live in 1998), and Shootenanny! (2003). The collection has received positive reviews by critics.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn Classic Rock, Rob Hughes gave this compilation 4 out of 5 stars, praising \"songs that are funny, sad, slightly surreal and sometimes harrowing, with an uncommon eye for the most telling details, however small\", but noting that the high price made this \"for collectors only\". At Louder Than War, Lee Hammond declared Eels \"one of the great bands of our generation\", stating that \"this box set documents an incredible rise of one of the worlds [sic] most loved bands\"; he rated this album an 8 out of 10. Writing for The Line of Best Fit, Alex Lee Thomson took the box set's release to assess the band's early career at large, calling Eels \"one of humanity’s greatest offerings to history\", noting how Eels never fit into mainstream rock radio and continuing that \"there’s so much range to their music as a whole it’s like sticking a pin in a map that expands in every direction from wherever you plot it\", ending that this run of works in particular are \"miraculous\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll tracks written by E, except as noted.\nBeautiful Freak\n\n\"Novocaine for the Soul\" (E and Mark Goldenberg) – 3:08\n\"Susan's House\" (E, Jim Jacobsen, and Jim Weatherly) – 3:43\n\"Rags to Rags\" (E) – 3:53\n\"Beautiful Freak\" (E) – 3:34\n\"Not Ready Yet\" (Jon Brion and E) – 4:46\n\"My Beloved Monster\" (E) – 2:13\n\"Flower\" (E and Jacobsen) – 3:38\n\"Guest List\" (E) – 3:13\n\"Mental\" (E) – 4:01\n\"Spunky\" (E) – 3:11\n\"Your Lucky Day in Hell\" (E and Goldenberg) – 4:28\n\"Manchild\" (E and Jill Sobule) – 4:05\nElectro-Shock Blues\n\n\"Elizabeth on the Bathroom Floor\" – 2:08\n\"Going to Your Funeral Part I\" (E, Jim Jacobsen, and Parthenon Huxley) – 2:37\n\"Cancer for the Cure\" (E and Mickey Petralia) – 4:46\n\"My Descent Into Madness\" (E, Paul Houston, Dan Nakamura, and Michael Simpson) – 3:54\n\"3 Speed\" – 2:45\n\"Hospital Food\" (Butch, E, and Jim Lang) – 3:23\n\"Electro-Shock Blues\" (E and Petralia) – 2:29\n\"Efils' God\" (E and Simpson) – 3:19\n\"Going to Your Funeral Part II\" (E, Jacobsen) – 1:30\n\"Last Stop: This Town\" (E and Simpson) – 3:27\n\"Baby Genius\" (E and Lang) – 2:04\n\"Climbing to the Moon\" – 3:38\n\"Ant Farm\" – 2:11\n\"Dead of Winter\" – 2:59\n\"The Medication Is Wearing Off\" (E and Petralia) – 3:51\n\"P.S.

        "content": "Cynthia K. Thompson is a neurolinguist and cognitive neuroscientist most known for her research on the brain and language processing and the neurobiology of language recovery in people with aphasia. She served as a member of the faculty at Northwestern University (NU) for 30 years as a Distinguished Ralph and Jean Sundin Professor in the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders. She also directed the Aphasia and Neurolinguistics Research Laboratory (ANRL) and the Center for the Neurobiology of Language Recovery (CNLR) and is a Distinguished Ralph and Jean Sundin Professor Emerita at NU.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThompson completed a B.S. in psychology from the University of Oregon in 1975, followed by an M.S. in Psychology and M.S. in Speech and Language Pathology in 1976 from the same institution. She received her Ph.D. in Speech and Language Pathology at the University of Kansas in 1983.\n\n\n== Career ==\nEarly in her academic career, Thompson held Assistant and associate professor positions at The Pennsylvania State University and the University of Florida, respectively. She joined the NU faculty in the Roxelyn and Richard Pepper Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders in 1992 and was appointed Distinguished Ralph and Ralph and Jean Sundin Professor in 2009. Among her many contributions to the department she founded and directed the Aphasia Center at NU.Thompson was Associate Editor for Language for the Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research from 2000 to 2003, and Specialty Chief Editor for the Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Speech and Language from 2019 to 2022. She has been an Action Editor for Cortex since 2014. She also served as Chair of the Research and Scientific Affairs Committee for the American Speech, Language, Hearing Association (ASHA) from 1998 to 2001 and Chair of the Clinical Aphasiology Program in 2001. For the Academy of Aphasia she served on the Board of Governors from 2003 to 2007 and again from 2011 to 2017, and as Treasurer from 2011 to 2017.Thompson is a fellow of the Mesulam Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer's Disease Center and the Buehler Center on Aging at NU and the Institute for the Advanced Study and Communication Process (University of Florida). She is a fellow of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) and received honors of the Association, the highest award conferred by ASHA in 2013.\n\n\n== Research ==\nThompson's research has focused on the neurobiology of language, particularly sentence processing in both neurotypical adults and those with aphasia resulting from stroke and neurodegenerative disease.Thompson has used both linguistic and psycholinguistic accounts of normal language processing to predict breakdown and recovery patterns in patients and to develop treatment for people with sentence processing impairments associated with aphasia. Her research team has used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and on-line eye tracking to investigate normal and disordered neurocognitive processing mechanisms and to chart patterns of language recovery.Thompson and her team found that healthy people engage a predominantly left hemisphere (LH) neural network for sentence processing. In large-scale aphasia treatment studies, they found that when the LH is damaged, right hemisphere (RH) regions are recruited to support treatment-induced recovery of sentence comprehension and production, attesting to RH neuroplasticity and adaptivity in rebuilding language processes. Her group also has identified critical brain tissue associated with sentence processing using voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping in people with aphasia.Thompson coined the Argument Structure Complexity Hypothesis (ASCH) and the Complexity Account of Treatment Efficacy (CATE), developed Treatment of Underlying Forms (TUF) for sentence processing impairments in aphasia, and identified behavioral and neural variables associated with language recovery and neuroplasticity, including white matter tract integrity and neural activation during rest (resting-state fMRI). She also developed diagnostic tools for assessing language disorders in adults with aphasia, including the Northwestern Assessment of Verbs and Sentences (NAVS), the Northwestern Anagram Test (NAT), the Northwestern Naming Battery (NNB), the Northwestern Assessment of Verb Inflection (NAVI), and a method for analyzing narrative language: the Northwestern Narrative Language Analysis System (NNLA). She has authored over 200 journal articles and 40 book chapters.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n1998 – Fellow, American Speech-Language-Hearing Association\n2007 – Martin E. and Gertrude G.

She was the second published Ivorian woman writer with her 1976 novel Djigbô.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nBolli was born in 1952 in Abidjan, and worked for a period at the Agence de Coopération Culturelle et Technique in Paris.\nHer 1976 novel Djigbô (published by the Centre d'édition et de diffusion africaines) dealt with the subject of witchcraft, a subject that has been rarely addressed in Ivorian literature. The book was only the second Ivorian book published by a woman writer, and sold well in bookstores on its release.\nShe has been described as among the best-known women writers of the Ivory Coast. She was one of only two women writers (the other being Simone Kaya, the first published woman Ivorian writer) included in l'Anthologie de la littérature ivoirienne (The Anthology of Ivorian Literature, 1983). Regina Yaou has said that both Bolli and Kaya experienced frustrations in entering the literary world.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hope H. Slatter II (1841 – after 1900) was a convicted murderer, municipal police chief, Confederate States Army veteran, and one of the sons of notable American slave trader Hope H. Slatter.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSlatter was born 1841 in Baltimore, before his father sold out of the slaving business and became a real estate investor in Mobile, Alabama. Slatter grew up in Mobile, and eventually attended Georgetown College (later Georgetown University), class of 1862. When the American Civil War broke out he joined the Confederate States Army, apparently as a second lieutenant in the 1st Alabama Infantry Regiment. In 1863 he accidentally shot and killed one Thomas Carver. According to an affidavit submitted in 1875, \"Mr. Slatter was fully exonerated from all intentional blame, so much so that it was not thought necessary to have a trial of the case at all. Being the commanding officer of the battalion at the time of the sad occurrence, the deponent [Price Williams Jr. of Mobile, Alabama] made this statement in justice to the character of the living and the dead.\"\nOn August 6, 1873, while attending the Schuetzenfest \"annual shooting competition and beer bash\" at Schuetzen Park in Washington, D.C., Slatter stabbed and killed one Michael Hussey. Slatter fled the scene of the crime but was captured in Virginia; when the police caught up with him he had with him a spring-back dagger and was sitting under a tree with a picnic basket that had been packed with \"a lot of crackers, three fresh boiled spring chickens on toast, a bottle of fine brandy, and a box of matches.\" Slatter Jr. was convicted of murder by a jury, but used his \"considerable\" inherited slave-trade wealth to bribe a federal district attorney to get him out of a murder conviction, he then testified against the attorney on charges of accepting a bribe. During his fewer than three years in prison for murder,  Slatter apparently did not enjoy the hospitality of the Albany Penitentiary and \"told a piteous tale of the severity of the discipline, by which the convicts are compelled to keep their eyes on the ground and not allowed to utter a syllable under pain of punishment by the shower bath, dark dungeon, flogging, etc.\"\nIn 1883, Slatter was appointed to be the chief of police of Mobile, Alabama.\nIn 1890, Hope H. Slatter II reached a deal with the U.S. government to pay $300 to fulfill a bond guarantee made by his uncle, capitalist Shadrack F. Slatter. (Back in November 1857, federal marshals had arrested freelance imperialist William Walker; politician Pierre Soulé and \"Col. Slatter\" posted the $2,000 bond for the standard bearer of the planned Golden Circle greater pro-slavery prosperity sphere. Walker jumped bail, leaving S. F. Slatter on the hook for the money.)\nHope H. Slatter Jr. was a resident of Mobile, Alabama as of the 1900 U.S. census. He is most likely buried in the family mausoleum at Magnolia Cemetery in Mobile, Alabama.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHenry F. Slatter, his older half-brother\n\n\n== References ==",

More recently, his lab has published an in-depth analysis of the cardiac chromatin 3D organisation and delineated detailed maps of cardiac enhancer-promoter interactions, enhancer genetics, and also through cardiomyocyte single nuclear sequencing reported the discovery of a long noncoding RNA, called Singheart, which regulates key cardiac gene expression. The approach of the lab is to deep dive into the epigenome of the heart, using advanced technology including Crispr-genome editing to explore frontiers, in continuing aspirations to discover novel avenues for therapies or biomarkers. Foo has also published on the application of Next Generation Sequencing genomics to patients in the clinic, and most recently was involved in the first phase of the innovative SG10K genomics project in Singapore.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mikhail Alexandrovich Fedotov (Russian: Михаил Александрович Федотов; born 18 September 1949) is a Russian jurist, politician, human rights activist, and former diplomat.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nFedotov was born in Moscow into a family of lawyers. In 1966, he entered the law faculty at Lomonosov Moscow State University, but was expelled in 1968 for participating in the human rights movement. At the request of several professors, he was allowed to return to the evening department of the university. He also worked as a journalist for the newspaper Vechernyaya Moskva. He graduated with a degree in law from Moscow State University in 1972, followed by postgraduate studies in the All-Union Correspondence Institute of Law in 1976. In 1976-1990 he taught at the All-Union Correspondence Institute of Law at the Department of State Law. At the same time, he created draft laws \"On the Press and other mass media\" (which eliminated preliminary censorship), \"On Public Associations\", \"On Mass Media\", \"On Archives\", \"On Publishing\". He headed the working group on the preparation of the draft law \"On Copyright and related rights\".\nIn September 1990 – May 1992, he served as the Deputy Minister of the Press and Mass Media in Russia. From December 1992 to August 1993, he held the position of Minister of Press and Information in Russia. In the summer of 1993, he fought against the Supreme Council's introduction of amendments to Russia's law \"On Mass Media\". After the vote on these amendments, Fedotov resigned as minister.\nBetween September 1993 and January 1998, Fedotov served as Russia's Permanent Representative to UNESCO.\nMikhail Fedotov's bid for the position of judge of the Constitutional Court of Russia has been rejected twice: once in 1991, by the 5th Congress of People's Deputies of Russia, and again in 1997, by the Federation Council.\nFedotov has represented the President of Russia before the Constitutional Court in cases involving the CPSU, the National Salvation Front, and the introduction of oversight boards on state TV and radio by the Congress of People's Deputies. He has also represented the president at Congresses of the People's Representatives and at the Supreme Council, has represented the Government of Russia at the constitutional assembly, and was a member of the working group on drafting the Constitution of Russia.\nAfter being appointed as chair of the Presidential Council for Civil Society and Human Rights in 2010, Mikhail Fedotov said that he saw \"de-Stalinizing public consciousness\" as one of the main goals of the council. On 1 March 2011, the Council revealed a project to \"de-Stalinize\" the Russian history of the 20th century. The proposed program has elicited contradictory reactions in Russian society. Leader of the Yabloko Party Sergei Mitrokhin, politician Vladimir Ryzhkov, as well as historian Andrey Zubov, have all expressed support for the initiative. Prime Minister of Lithuania Andrius Kubilius has welcomed the Human Rights Council's proposal to recognize the USSR's responsibility for genocide during World War II, describing it as an \"attempt to look honestly at country's history and conscience\". Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis has positively assessed Fedotov's work in this area. However, members of the Presidential Council Emil Pain and Alexey Pushkov have taken a critical stance towards the proposed \"de-Stalinization\" program, as they believe it cannot serve as a basis for national reconciliation in modern Russia and will lead to further national division. Several experts, historians, and politicians have strongly criticized the \"de-Stalinization\" initiative and the activities of Fedotov. Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov has expressed Fedotov's personal responsibility for Russia's current troubles, while the Council he heads has been compared to foreign \"Russophobic\" centers. Valery Fyodorov, CEO of Russian Public Opinion Research Center, has stated that as the \"homegrown de-Stalinizers\" continue their efforts, their reputation will continue to decline, while Stalin's image will likely gain favor.\n\n\n== Honours ==\n Russia: Order of Friendship (2014)\n Russia: Laureate of the Award of the Government of the Russian Federation for the field of printed media (2009)\n Russia: Honoured Lawyer of Russia (1999)\n UNESCO: UNESCO Medal in honor of the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1999)\n USSR: Laureate of the Union of Journalists of the USSR Award (1990)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The blockade of southern Chalatenango began on 24 March 2024 when Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele ordered 5,000 soldiers and 1,000 police officers to blockade and enter the four municipalities in southern Chalatenango. The blockade is the second to be implemented in the Chalatenango Department after the blockade of Nueva Concepción which began in May 2023. The blockade aims to dismantle the 18 Sureños clique of the 18th Street gang.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nOn 27 March 2022, the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador voted to implement a state of emergency after criminal gangs in El Salvador killed 87 people over the course of one weekend. The vote began the Salvadoran gang crackdown which up to 24 March 2024 had resulted in the arrests of over 78,100 people with suspected gang affiliations. In late-2022 and throughout 2023, the Salvadoran government implemented blockades of parts of the country where gang presence remained high after the crackdown initially began. On 17 May 2023, the Salvadoran Army and the National Civil Police initiate a blockade of Nueva Concepción, a municipality of the Chalatenango Department in northern El Salvador.\n\n\n== Blockade ==\nOn 18 March 2024, a homicide was reported to the National Civil Police in San José Cancasque. A few days later on 22 March, a second homicide was reported in the city of Chalatenango. The homicides were linked to the 18 Sureños gang, and the alleged assailants of the two homicides were captured by the National Civil Police by 24 March. The police also recovered the two shotguns allegedly used in the homicides. Radio YSUCA reported that residents in southern Chalatenango noticed an increased military presence following the homicides, and some claimed that the government was going to implement a blockade.On 24 March, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele announced on X the beginning of a blockade in the southern Chalatenango municipalities of Potonico, San Antonio Los Ranchos, San José Cancasque, and San Isidro Labrador due to the two homicides committed in the days prior. Bukele stated that the goal of the blockade was to dismantle 18 Sureños gang, a clique of the 18th Street gang. A total of 5,000 soldiers and 1,000 police officers were mobilized to blockade the municipalities and arrest gang members. Bukele included a video in his post, in which, the two arrested suspects were shown in front of columns of soldiers.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nBukele ended his announcement by stating that \"we will not stop until we eradicate what little remains of the gangs\" (\"no nos vamos a detener hasta erradicar lo poco que aún queda de las pandillas\"). Minister of National Defense René Merino Monroy wrote on X that \"we will clean the zone completely, we will extract up to the final remnants of the gangs\" (\"limpiaremos por completo la zona, vamos a extraer hasta el último remanente de pandillas\"). Director of the National Civil Police Mauricio Arriaza Chicas stated that the blockade's objective was to \"eradicate the 18S clique which commits crime in the zone\" (\"erradicar la clica de 18S que delinque en la zona\").Cristosal, a Salvadoran human rights non-governmental organization, asked the military and the police to respect the rights of residents \"forced to open their houses\" (\"obligados a abrir sus casas\") in order to search for gang members, and to respect the rights of individuals arrested. Cristosal claimed that the security forces were engaging in arbitrary arrests during the blockade. Cristosal also claimed that the blockade was established in the four municipalities specifically because they voted for Manuel Flores of the left-wing Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) over Bukele in the presidential election two months earlier. Cristosal added that the government had \"repeated utilized the army as political tool on occassions to generate pressure and fear in various parts of the country\" (\"utilizado en reiteradas ocasiones al ejército como instrumento político para generar presión y miedo en diversos territorios del país\").Residents of the four municipalities under blockade told La Prensa Gráfica that the area had not had a gang problem in \"more than six years\" (\"más de siete años\"). The Resistance and Popular Rebellion Bloc denounced the blockade as a \"military invasion\" (\"invasión militar\") and demanded the security forces' withdrawal. The Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) questioned Bukele's involvement in organizing the blockade as he was granted a leave of absence in November 2023 in order to seek re-election in 2024; Bukele legally would not be able to order the blockade's implementation as Merino had confirmed Bukele did.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBlockade of the Cabañas Department\nBlockade of Nueva Concepción\nBlockade of Soyapango\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Out West is the 4th  episode of the second season of The Ren & Stimpy Show that originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on 29 August 1992.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn a remote town in the American Southwest some time in the 19th century the law is represented by two stereotypical hillbilly \"yahoos\", the brutalist, ignorant, moronic Sheriff Abner Dimwit and his equally asinine and vicious Deputy Sheriff, Ewalt Nitwit. The principle interest of Dimwit and Nitwit in life is hanging people for their sadistic amusement. Dimwit and Nitwit have hanged countless innocent people merely for the pleasure of executing people, leading Abner to ponder if perhaps they should execute someone who is actually guilty of a crime for once. Bored as there is no else left to hang, the duo are delighted when two outlaws Ren aka Three-Fingered Höek and his sidekick Stimpy aka Stupid the Kid arrive in their town to \"loot and pillage\". Despite the wanted posters of Ren and Stimpy, Dimwit and Nitwit fail to recognize them. Urged on by Abner and Ewalt to commit a crime to provide them with an excuse to hang them, Ren and Stimpy steal first the sheriff's obese wife and then Mr. Horse. Even then, Dimwit and Nitwit cannot understand what was happening and Mr. Horse has to explain to them that he has been stolen. Dimwit and Nitwit attempt to hang Ren and Stimpy, but fail as Ren is too lightweight for the rope to break his neck while Stimpy is too fat. Out of desperation to hang someone, Dimwit and Nitwit hang themselves. As they slowly suffocate to death, they join Ren and Stimpy in singing a song in praise of the joys of hanging people entitled \"The Lord Loves a Hanging, That's Why He Gave Us Necks\".\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of John Kricfalusi\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nMr. Horse-voice of John Kricfalusi\nAbner Dimwit-voice of Jim Smith\nEwalt Nitwit-voice of Bob Camp\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe episode was approved by the Nickelodeon network in November 1991 with a premiere set for August 1992. Bob Camp who co-wrote the story for Out West later complained about the network censorship as there were scenes \"cut out for one reason or another and we had had to make last-minute substitutions so it wasn't quite as funny\". Production at the Spümcø studio was divided between the prestigious \"A\" productions directed personally by the showrunner John Kricfalusi which received more time and larger budgets vs. the less prestigious \"B\" productions directed by Bob Camp which received less time and lower budgets. For the second season, Out West along with In The Army, Mad Dog Hoëk and Monkey See, Monkey Don't were the lesser \"B\" productions assigned to Camp. Kricfalusi co-wrote the story for Out West along with Camp, but was not especially involved in its production. Unlike the \"A' productions headed by the perfectionist Kricfalusi, the \"B\" productions headed by Camp moved forward at a swifter pace and were completed on time. Camp stated he saved time because: \"I storyboarded straight ahead, full size on layout paper, that's doing layout and storyboard at the same. Someone would take all the scenes and make a storyboard out of it, and we would do lay-out\".Out West came in slightly under budget owing to Camp's production methods. The network rules forbade the characters from drinking alcohol, but in Out West there are numerous corks in the background, which suggests that the inability of Abner and Ewalt to understand even the simplest of concepts is due not only to their stupidity, but also because they are drunk as well. \nThe process of drawing in the scenes for Out West was done at the Carbunkle studio of Vancouver in the spring of 1992. Kricfalusi would preferred to have the work sub-contracted out to a cheap studio in Asia, but selected the Carbunkle studio, which needed work as Sven Höek was not ready yet. Chris Sauvé of the Carbunkle studio stated about the scene he illustrated of Ren and Stimpy riding into town on giant chickens: \"It was the only scene I ever did on Ren & Stimpy where I actually did a live-action reference. I went and some kid's move, The Adventures of Milo & Otis and I still-framed this scene of all these chickens. I was just amazed at how fast those chickens moved their heads. It was basically popping from pose to pose: if it wasn't it was one frame held and then that flappy thing underneath would move\"..  When it aired in 1992, the Nickelodeon network censored the scene where Abner and Ewalt placed the nooses around their necks along with Ewalt's line \"y'all bring the kids next time, ya hear!\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe American journalist Thad Komorowski criticized Out West for its \"peculiarly sluggish pacing\" as he complained that there were too many scenes meant to establish the stupidity of Abner and Ewalt that consisted of them staring blankly into space as they struggled to understand the simplest of concepts that were severely \"taxing\" for the audience. However, Komorowski praised the ending as \"the willful and blatant shattering of every taboo\" that \"marks one of the defining moments of the series\". Most notably, the song The Lord Loves A Hanging, That's Why He Gave Us Necks invokes traditional American values and Christianity in support of capital punishment. However, the song is being ironical in its nominal pro-death penalty stance as the song is told from the viewpoint of someone who gratuitously wants to see people hanged merely for the sadistic pleasure of watching someone die, which undermines the pro capital punishment message.  The ending of Out West was banned in the United Kingdom by the British Board of Film Classification under the grounds that \"the subject of hanging is presented as comedic, fun and risk free, on the grounds of potential harm to the likely audience and in accordance with the Video Recordings Act 1984.\"\n\n\n== Books ==\nDobbs, G.

        "content": "Pacifico Fiori (1898 – late 20th century) was an Italian writer, journalist and playwright, renowned particularly as a novelist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in 1898 in Calalzo di Cadore, a small town in Italian region of Veneto, Fiori moved to Milan where he began his journalistic career in 1921, collaborating with the humor magazine Barbapedana (1921–1923), with Cacciatore Italiano (a periodical of which he was also the editor-in-chief until its closure) and, from 1924, with the satirical weekly Il Guerrin Meschino. In 1926, he joined the main Italian newspaper, Corriere della Sera, where he remained for nineteen years and then also wrote for the Corriere d'Informazione, la Domenica del Corriere, Corriere dei Piccoli, La Lettura (1937–1945), and Fantasie d'Italia.In 1943, Fiori published his first detective novel, Colpa segreta, followed by Il filone d'oro and Lo smeraldo di Maria Antonietta in 1944. The following year, he released the novel La squadra fantasma, illustrated by Carlo Cossio, and in 1946, Entro il sei Marzo, published in the I romanzi dell'avventura series by Edizioni Alpe directed by Romualdo Natoli (previously published in 1943 in la Domenica del Corriere).From the forties onwards, he was also prolific as a playwright. In 1946, he wrote the comedy La signorina No, awarded at the Milan Casa della cultura by Sabatino Lopez. In 1949, he published the farces Non c'è trucco! and La poltrona di Procuste, followed by the three-act comedy Non si sa mai, the comic opera Due schiaffi non-te li leva nessuno, and the detective comedy La banda della nebbia.In 1951 for Carlo Signorelli Editore, he wrote the two volumes La storia del Far West (The History of the Far West) and La storia degli ammutinati del Bounty (The History of the Mutineers of the Bounty), with illustrations by Francesco Pescador, both published in the popular literature series directed by Gian Carlo Testoni. In 1955, he published the essay Sono innocente (I am Innocent) with Cappelli, which The Italian Scene in New York City listed in early 1956 among the most read books in Italy. Dedicated to the theme of judicial errors, the book addressed dozens of cases of wrongful convictions worldwide, from the case of the Little Baker of Venice, to the Gino Girolimoni case, from the Dreyfus affair to the story of Sacco and Vanzetti.In the same year, he wrote the novel The Prairie Rebels, which earned him the Castello Prize and also had good international success: translated into English by H. E. Scott, it was published with illustrations by Nadir Quinto both in the United Kingdom in 1959 (The Prairie Rebels), and in the United States in 1960 (The Wild Horses of Tuscany), and then in South Africa in 1963 with translation by Marie Agostinis (Die rebelle van die grasvlakte). The book, set in the Tuscan Maremma, told the story of Pippo, Vanni, and Bicci and the three foals that had invaded their farm, while the Second World War was in its final stages. British critics described it as \"a remarkable piece of literature providing a thoroughly enjoyable reading experience\".His Far West of 1964, published by Signorelli in different editions with different pagination, was republished by Rylee in 1969 in the United Kingdom, with translation by Susan Cannata. In 1963, Fiori published the short story collection A tu per tu con le belve (Face to Face with Beasts), included by Lina Sacchetti in her History of Literature for Youth from 1968.A friend of Dino Buzzati, in his old age Fiori wrote the column The Secretary for Everyone for Domenica del Corriere directed by Guglielmo Zucconi, in which he answered readers' questions on various topics.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nPacifico Fiori (1942).

        "content": "Sechele II Kealeboga Sebele (c. 1860–1918) was kgosi of the Kwena tribe in the Bechuanaland Protectorate (modern day Botswana) from 1911 until his death in 1918. His rule was marked by a split within the tribe as opposing dikgosana led by his uncles rejected his authority. Sechele II was succeeded by his son Sebele II.\n\n\n== Life ==\nSechele II Kealeboga Sebele was born c. 1860, and he became kgosi of the Kwena tribe in 1911.\nSechele II's reign was plagued by an opposition group of dikgosana led by his uncles Kebohula and Moiteelasilo. The group felt that he was promoting too many advisors who did not have seniority in the tribe, and they opposed his endorsement of un-Christian traditional practices such as polygamy and bogwera. This group was supported by the London Missionary Society, whom Sechele II had alienated after he allowed Anglicanism to be practiced by the Bakwena in 1912. A schism occurred in 1915, when Sechele II moved the tribe's kgotla from Borakalalo to Ntsweng, reversing a move by his predecessor. The opposition remained in Borakalalo, effectively splitting the tribe. The schism was not remedied until 1937, when the British forced them to merge and destroyed much of Ntsweng.\nSechele II had a wife, Lena Rauwe, who oversaw the introduction of Anglicanism in Kweneng. He also married Gagoumakwe Kgari Sechele, an activist who continued to hold political influence after Sechele II's death. Sechele II's secretary as kgosi was Richard Sidzumo.\nSechele II allowed the BaKwena Tribal Council to form in May 1916, but he limited its power by promoting his own allies. Baruti Kgosidintsi, a major opposition figure against Sebele I and Sechele II, was found guilty of impregnating Sechele II's ex-wife in 1916.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nSechele II died in 1918. He was then succeeded on 12 February 1918 by his son Sebele II, after the latter's return from serving in the South African Native Labour Corps. Sechele II's grandson Bonewamang Padi Sechele was recognised as a legitimate heir of the Kwena chiefdom in 1963 but the court denied that he was next to succeed. Schele II's younger son, Neale Schele, was chosen by the colonial administration as a compromise and appointed as kgosi, but his rule was not welcomed by the Bakwena. Bonewamang Padi Sechele later served as tribal authority of the Kweneng District from 1970 to 1978 after Neale Schele's removal.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nMorton, Barry; Ramsay, Jeff (2018).

It is located at a distance of circa 45 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 3726 is about 18,000 light years across. NGC 3985 is situated north of the celestial equator and, as such, it is more easily visible from the Northern Hemisphere. The galaxy appears to have one spiral arm.\nNGC 3985 belongs in the NGC 3877 group, which is part of the south Ursa Major groups, part of the Virgo Supercluster. Other galaxies in the same group are NGC 3726, NGC 3893, NGC 3896, NGC 3906, NGC 3928, NGC 3949, and NGC 4010.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Carlton County History and Heritage Center is a museum located in Cloquet, Minnesota. The building, located in former historic Shaw Memorial Library, is owned and operated by the Carlton County Historical Society. The museum is dedicated to preserving and displaying the history of Carlton County. The Society has collected and preserved the history of Carlton County since 1949 and has operated out of the building since 1987.On March 28, 2019, Carlton County transferred the deed for the museum building to the Carlton County Historical Society. Back in the 1980s, the city of Cloquet had sold the building to the county for $1. The County Board of Commissioners voted to transfer the deed to the Society for the same nominal amount.Four rotating exhibits are on display each year, with two permanent exhibits focusing on the fires of 1918 and the lumber industries.\n\n\n== Shaw Memorial Library ==\nThe Shaw Memorial Library, later known as the Cloquet Public Library, served the community of Cloquet as the only public library building in Carlton County since its construction in 1920 until 1987, when library moved to a new location. Architecturally the building is important as an accomplished design by the Duluth architectural firm of Kelly and Shefchik, and as one of the group of permanent public buildings constructed after the fire of October 12, 1918 destroyed the city of Cloquet along with a majority of Carlton County and southern St. Louis County. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 1985.\n\n\n=== Building description ===\nThe one-story square brick building is adorned with white Bedford stone, showcasing a blend of architectural elements. An elevated basement, separated by a stone watertable, adds to its grandeur. Arched windows with brick surrounds, decorative keystones, and stone sills grace the facade, while a balustrade crowns the flat roof. The arched stone entrance, flanked by Doric pilasters, leads to the Shaw Memorial Library, its name etched in stone. Originally designed with separate areas for children's and adult reading rooms, reference areas, and lecture rooms, the structure embodies the Renaissance Revival style. The basement also housed meeting spaces, a kitchen, and a packing room.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Carlton County, Minnesota\nList of museums in Minnesota",

        "content": "COMITIA (Japanese: コミティア, Hepburn: Komitia) is a doujinshi convention for original doujin (self-published) works held in various locations across Japan. COMITIA is typically held four times per year in Tokyo, and 2–3 times per year in Niigata (since 1991), Nagoya (since January 1993), and the Kansai region (since April 1993). Less regular events are also hosted in Sapporo (since 2014), Tōhoku (since 2015), and Kitakyushu (since 2017). As an event series focusing on non-derivative work, the sale of fan art, fanzines, fan fiction, and other parody material of existing copyrighted franchises is prohibited. It is the largest convention focused completely on original works in Japan.\nVarious high-profile manga artists, such as Keiichi Arawi and Kenshin Shinzato, have previously exhibited at COMITIA.\n\n\n== History ==\nSince 1984, COMITIA has been hosted regularly by the COMITIA Organizational Committee, a not-for-profit volunteer organization. Events in Tokyo are referred to as Tokyo COMITIA while other cities feature conventions known as Regional COMITIA (地方コミティア, Chihō Komitia), which are organized by other volunteer-run groups. The Niigata event shares an organizational team with Niigata Comic Market.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the cancellation of multiple COMITIA events. A crowdfunding campaign was held in late 2020 and resulted in over ¥100 million (US$960,000) being raised to cover administrative expenses, venue fees, and the purchase of personal protective equipment for use during future events.\n\n\n== Recent conventions ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCOMITIA main website (in Japanese)\nNiigata COMITIA website (in Japanese)\nNagoya COMITIA website (in Japanese)\nKansai COMITIA website (in Japanese)\nHokkaido COMITIA website (in Japanese)\nMichinoku COMITIA website (in Japanese)\nKyushu COMITIA website (in Japanese)",

        "content": "But I'll Wait for You is the sixth studio album by American indie rock band Local Natives. It was released on April 19, 2024, through Loma Vista Recordings and Concord.\nThe album comes nine months after the band's fifth studio album, Time Will Wait for No One (2023), and is described as its companion or \"sister\" album. It was preceded by the singles \"April\" and \"Alpharetta\".\n\n\n== Background ==\nRecorded during the same sessions as Time Will Wait for No One, Local Natives described the album as \"the second half of a large body of music we made together, the first half we shared last year with Time Will Wait for No One. It’s a companion piece. A sister album. Maybe not an answer to a question, but an exhale to an inhale. So little is in our control, but among all this chaos we can choose to be there for each other. Thank you again to John Congleton, Michael Harris, and Danny Reisch, the incredibly talented producers who helped us bring these songs into their fully realized selves.\"\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe album's lead single, \"April\", was released simultaneously with the album announcement on March 25, 2024. \"Alpharetta\" was released as the second single on April 5, 2024.

        "revision_id": 1219645457,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The Syriac Alexander Romance (known in Syriac as the Tašʿītā d̄ʾAleksandrōs) is an anonymous Christian text in the tradition of the Greek Alexander Romance of Pseudo-Callisthenes, potentially translated into Syriac the late sixth or early seventh century. Just like the Res gestae Alexandri Macedonis of Julius Valerius Alexander Polemius, the Armenian Alexander Romance and the Historia de preliis of Leo the Archpriest, the Syriac Romance belongs to the α recension of the Greek Romance, as is represented by the Greek manuscript A (Paris. 1711). Another text, the Syriac Alexander Legend, appears as an appendix in manuscripts of the Syriac Alexander Romance, but the inclusion of the Legend into manuscripts of the Romance is the work of later redactors and does not reflect an original relationship between the two.\nThe Syriac Romance had an enormous influence, with versions of it being produced across late antiquity, the Middle Ages, and the early modern period in Europe, Asia, and Africa. In one study by Friedrich Pfister, over two hundred derivations, translations, and versions of it were recorded.\nThe text was first translated into English in 1889 by E. A. Wallis Budge.\n\n\n== Provenance ==\nBased on its surviving manuscripts, some suggest an origins of the in upper Mesopotamia at the hands of Nestorian religious figure (like a priest or monk). Nevertheless, these manuscripts are rather late and may provide little support to this theory, and many Syriac speaking Christian communities other than Nestorians were available as candidates for the creation of the text. At the same time, almost all identifiable Syriac authors were clergymen, and so the view that the author of the Romance was also a clergyman remains justified. Scholars also continue to believe that the text was produced sometime from the late sixth to the first half of the seventh century, potentially in the aftermath of the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628 which some believe is a plausible political context for the genesis of the text. Little internal evidence exists for the dating of the text, although the name Khusrau is used instead of Xerxes, which most likely refers either to Khosrow I (r. 531–579) or Khosrow II (r. 590–628).\nTheodor Nöldeke has influentially argued that it was translated from a lost Middle-Persian (Pahlavi) version of the Alexander Romance, though this theory has been disputed in recent decades in favor of the alternative hypothesis that it represents a direct translation from the Greek, which now represents the consensus. \n\n\n== Structure ==\nAs with the Greek Romance, the Syriac version is divided into three main sections (or books). In the Syriac, the first book contains 47 chapters, the second 14 chapters, and the third 24 chapters (for a total of 85 chapters). The Syriac text lacks a prologue but does have a conclusion which appears in the 22nd chapter of the third book in Budge's edition. The content is structured into various themes or topoi, such as battles, geoanthropological information, biographical elements and so forth.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nGenerally speaking, the Syriac Romance follows the Greek closely in terms of the overall plot. It is a pluri-thematic text and can be divided into three main narratives:\n\nAlexander's youth and education\nHis military workings against Greeks, Macedonians, Persians, and Indians\nAlexander's testament and death\nThe story begins by describing how the Egyptian Pharaoh Nectanebo II, learning of the treason of the gods against him, escapes from Egypt to Macedonia. He comes into contact with the king, Philip II, and his wife Olympias. Pretending to be the god Amun, he impregnates Olympias, and Philip is unsuspecting that the child is not his. Once the child is born, Philip names him Alexander. Alexander begins to be educated by the wisest men available to the court, and at an early age displays his military prowess, such as at a horse racing competition. It is not long before Alexander begins to desire establishing a universal empire. He goes on to conquer the Greek and Macedonian cities and the Achaemenid (Persian) Empire. During the \"farewell discourse\", a vaticinium ex eventu prophecy unveils the plot to kill Alexander. The narrative-cycle of Alexander's death is formed by his last will and passing away. He is buried in Alexandria, Egypt, the greatest city he founded during his journey and conquests.\nThe plot as recounted above follows that of the Greek Romance. However, the Syriac Romance also contains several of its own episodes not found in the original, such as Alexander's journey to China, the killing of a dragon by feeding it an oxen filled with gypsum, pitch, and sulfur, Alexander's desert-journey fighting nomads, founding the cities of Samarkand and Merv, and construction of a temple of Rhea/Nâni. Other changes include a loss of several contents of the Greek, a significant transformation and expansion of Alexander's letter to Aristotle (the 'miracle letter'), and unique adventures recorded after the episode of the 'night of horrors'. The story that was to be gain the greatest resonance in later literature would be Alexander's visit to China; though entirely fictitious, it emerged as a product of some (limited) cultural exchanges with the region in periods after Alexander lived. No substantive knowledge of China exists in the text, although it is aware that an important export from the region was silk.\n\n\n== Manuscripts ==\nFive manuscripts of the Syriac Romance are known, which have been termed A through E. The following comments and description of the manuscripts are quoted from Monferrer-Sala 2011. \n\nA = BL. Add. 25875. Paper. 36 quires. 362 leaves divided in two columns of 28 lines, about 8 7/8 in. by 6 1/8 in. Good strangelā writing with numerous vowel points. Dated in 1708–9 A.D. (= AG 2020–21).\nB = American Oriental Society. Paper. 18 quires. 185 leaves with 20 lines per page, about 8 3/8 in. by 6 5/8 in. Good strangelā writing with numerous vowel points. Dated in 1844 A.D. (= AG 2155). It is a copy made by the Rev J. Perkins in Urmia from an unknown older MS.27 The MS B El MS B has several glosses in fellīḥī, the neoAramaic dialectal variety in Urmia.\nD = Owned by E.A. Wallis Budge. Paper. 12 quires. 123 leaves paginated in Syriac graphemes (ʾ-rkg) with 22 lines per page, about 14 in. by 8 ½. Accurated bold strangelā writing with numerous vowel points. The text is the copy ordered by Budge in 1886 to a scribe called ʾŌšaʿnā from a MS dated in 1848 A.D. (= AG 2159), whose errors were corrected by the copyist at several places.\nE = Owned by E.A. Wallis Budge. Paper. 15 quires. 160 leaves with 20 lines per page, about 9 ¼ in. by 6 ¾. It is another copy of a text ordered by Budge, also from 1886, from an old Nestorian MS, kept in the Library of Alqōš. The copy, made by a “first-rate scribe” was contrasted with the original and corrected by the Chaldean Patriarch.30 It is another text whose copy was commissioned by Budge, also in 1886, starting from an old Nestorian MS that remains in the Alqōš library. The copy made by a ‘first rate scribe’ was contrasted with the original and corrected by the Chaldean Patriarch.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAlexander the Great in legend\nQissat al-Iskandar\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nDebié, Muriel (2022). \"Textual Exchanges in Late Antiquity: East and South of Byzantium Seen Through an Eastern Christian Lens\".

        "content": "The history of the Spanish press, understood more as a positivist study of the historical archive of periodicals than as a history of journalism or communications, began around the 15th or 16th centuries in a scattered fashion with manuscripts and the woodcut printing of relaciones de sucesos. Shortly after, the invention of the printing press brought the printing of the first gazettes, although the beginning of journalism in Spain is usually considered to be 1661, the year of the appearance of the Gazeta de Madrid or Gaceta de Madrid, From then on, the so-called \"old journalism\" would develop until 1789, characterized by the dominance of the State. In the 19th century, the business press began to appear, competing with the workers' press and the partisan press, all of which suffered a crisis from 1898 onwards, culminating in the disappearance of numerous newspapers at the beginning of the Civil War. Once democracy was restored after the 1978 Constitution, big media companies completely took over Spanish newspapers.\n\n\n== Up until the 17th century ==\n\nThe history of journalism in Spain begins with the Romances noticieros, which reported the events of the Granada War in the 15th century. In the 16th century, xylography or wood engraving allowed for the mass and inexpensive publication of all kinds of brief writings. Thus began the publication of relaciones de sucesos by people paid by a municipal council to write, in an adorned manuscript, a report or record of any religious festivity, inauguration, important visit, commemoration, celebration, or memorable event to serve as a memento for the inhabitants, as well as avisos, which were handwritten reports also paid for and sent from time to time to nobles who wished to be informed of any important event that took place in the Court during their enforced absence.\nNews reporting began with handwritten letters about the events of the conquest of Granada and continued with reports related to the New World, when pamphlets were printed on the first victories of the Spanish conquerors in the Americas. Perhaps the first relacionero was humanist Peter Martyr d'Anghiera, who between 1488 and 1526 wrote no fewer than 812 letters that incorporated many news elements. This type of news correspondent was relatively frequent in the courts during the 17th century, and the notices written by Jerónimo de Barrionuevo, Andrés de Almansa, or José Pellicer de Ossau Salas y Tovar have been preserved. The news agencies of the time were places called mentideros in the Court: Gradas de San Felipe—the stairs of the now-defunct Convento de San Felipe el Real next to the Puerta del Sol—which specialized in military affairs and weapons expertise, and was very close to the Calle del Correo street, where couriers arrived carrying the news; Losas de Palacio—next to the now-defunct Royal Alcázar of Madrid—where news about the king, the royal family, and nobility were shared; and Representantes, where theater people used to gather: artists, actors, poets, and writers, located at the confluence of the Calle del Prado and Calle del León streets. That is why the men of letters of the time, such as Cervantes, Lope de Vega, Góngora, or Quevedo looked for houses nearby to live in.\nIt was also around this time that the mercurios or gacetas started to appear, a sort of bulletin that reported on the news of important trade fairs or ports with heavy traffic. In 1625, Avisos de Italia, Flandes, Roma, Portugal y otras partes appeared in Seville from 28 July to 3 August, and in 1641, Jaume Romeu published a translation of the Gazette de France from the French into Catalan–Gaseta vinguda a esta ciutat de Barcelona, per l’ordinari de París, vui a 28 de maig, any 1641. Traduïda del francès en nostra llengua catalana.— which can be considered the first weekly publication to appear in the Iberian Peninsula.\nMoreover, John Joseph of Austria, prime minister to Charles II, took an interest in the popularity and influence that such gazettes were acquiring in society and thus started to advertise himself by publishing gazettes. He saw in this medium a way to cement his position and satisfy his interests and, for this purpose, he hired Francisco Fabro Bremundán, the first known Spanish gazetteer, to write and print the first Spanish gazette in 1661, the Relación o gaceta de algunos casos particulares, así políticos como militares, sucedidos en la mayor parte del mundo, published once a month, although in Zaragoza it continued as a weekly publication in 1676.\nBut the death of John Joseph of Austria and revenge by his enemies put the publication on hold for a while. It was resumed, however, under the title of Gaceta Ordinaria de Madrid, although Fabro already had a competitor: the Nuevas Ordinarias by Sebastián Armendáriz. In 1697, after Fabro's death, his newspaper continued to be published without interruption as the Gazeta de Madrid or Gaceta de Madrid and, with an occasional change of title, it continues to be printed today as the Boletín Oficial del Estado. On the other hand, it is worthy of note that newspapers in Spanish were not only published in Spain; thus, it should come as no surprise that the oldest known Jewish newspaper is the Gazeta de Ámsterdam, published in Spanish between 1675 and 1690 for the Spanish-Portuguese people that arrived in the Netherlands, although there was a distinct lack of news of Jewish interest.\n\n\n== 18th century ==\n\nGazettes began to appear in all major cities throughout the 17th and 18th centuries and soon the contents grew more diversified and widespread, although at this time newspapers were very expensive and were only within the reach of a minority. However, it was undoubtedly one of the most important ways in which enlightened ideas and bourgeois ideology entered Spain. Taking into account that, at this time, 80 percent of the population was illiterate, readers of \"periodical papers\" were an enlightened minority composed of nobles and clergymen, members of the royal bureaucracy, army officers, and some sectors of the middle class such as doctors, lawyers, professors, and merchants.\nDuring the eighteenth century, three periods stood out:\n\nBetween 1737 and 1750: the consolidation of the press in Spain, with the appearance of the first newspapers, such as El Diario de los Literatos.\nBetween 1750 and 1770: the time of maturity and specialization, such as the Diario de Madrid.\nStarting in 1770: the time of decadence; although some interesting publications were born in 1774, linked to the boom set forth by Pedro Rodríguez de Campomanes of the Sociedades Económicas de Amigos del País, many publications disappeared due to political events and the situation abroad (the French Revolution).\nTwo types of publications were clearly distinguished: the educated press (periodicals) and the popular press (almanacs and forecasts).\nThe educated press or periodicals were printed with the permission of the Council of Castile and were subject to ecclesiastical censorship. They could be bought in bookstores or street stalls or be read in cafés, and they were sold by the blind, who had a monopoly on their distribution.\nPolitical and military information was in the hands of two official newspapers: Gaceta de Madrid and Mercurio Histórico y Político. Private publications mainly dealt with cultural or economic issues. They almost always supported an advanced ideology and their readers were an enlightened and bourgeois minority.\nThe execution of the French royal family led to an increase in censorship and the temporary suspension of the press: on 24 February 1791, King Charles IV of Spain banned the publication of all press materials except official newspapers.\n\nBut the bourgeoisie also created popular publications that, already existing in the 17th century, evolved throughout the 18th century: almanacs and forecasts. These were illustrated booklets with engravings that were distributed by the thousands in towns and cities and offered, under the guise of reporting on the weather, the most varied contents: apart from the meteorological forecast for the year, they included data on the phases of the moon, thoughts, standards of conduct, and instructions and teachings on the most varied trades. They attracted the attention of the public with sensationalist titles and had two sections: La introducción al Juicio del año, a prediction of what was going to happen that year according to the stars, and El Juicio del año, a sort of star chart by seasons, months, and days. They are valuable today because they represent a compilation of popular culture and a way of spreading bourgeois values among the lower classes. But their dangerous nature led Charles III of Spain to prohibit their publication in 1767 on the pretext that they were vain and useless reading materials for the people. These publications did not disappear in the nineteenth century, but their purpose changed since the bourgeoisie had a much more effective and direct means for spreading their ideas: popular newspapers. The most famous almanacs were those of Diego de Torres Villarroel, who revived and updated the genre with his Ramillete de astros (1718) by turning the Juicio del año into a fictitious narrative in which fantastical characters made the prediction, taking advantage of the opportunity to insert descriptions, monologues, and other varied materials.\nEl Diario de los Literatos (1737) was a cultural and literary publication that lasted until 1742. It fought against baroque ideas and supported the work of Benito Jerónimo Feijóo y Montenegro and Ignacio de Luzán. Its purpose was emitir un juicio ecuánime sobre todos los libros que se publiquen en España. It had 400 pages, in book format, cost 4 to 5 reales, and had a print run of between 1,000 and 1,500 copies in circulation. Juan de Iriarte and other scholars of the time wrote for it. It was formed by a group of \"well-known writers, desirous of reforming (...) the decadent literature of the eighteenth century\" who \"published a kind of magazine, which merited the protection of Philip IV (...).\" It was modeled after the Parisian Journal de Savants.\nIn 1738, Salvador José Mañer started translating the Mercurio Histórico y Político from the French. Then, in his printed work in 1774, Juan de Iriarte criticized Mañer for his poor-quality translations. In 1784, already larger in size, its title was changed to Mercurio de España and it has been, with the exception of La Gaceta and El Diario de Madrid, the newspaper that has survived the longest.\nEl Diario Noticioso, Curioso, Erudito, Comercial y Político was the first daily publication in Spain. It consisted of two sections, one for spreading the news, including opinion pieces that were often translations from the French, and another containing economic information, where sales, rentals, offers, demands, etc. were announced. On 17 January 1758, by royal privilege, Manuel Ruiz de Uribe y Compañía was granted permission to publish it in Madrid. Its first issue was dated 1 February 1758. It was edited by Francisco Mariano Nipho, a restless, erudite, multi-subject author of encyclopedic curiosity, who has come to be considered the first professional journalist in Spanish literature and who published almost a hundred works, twenty of which were periodicals. In 1788, the Diario Noticioso, Curioso, Erudito y Comercial, Político y Económico changed its title to Diario de Madrid.\nThere was also press that specialized in economic matters, since enlightened ideas supported reforms in this field. El Semanario Económico (1765–1766) spread the technical advances for the improvement of industry and diverse economic texts. On the other hand, the literary press was very widespread. Some works that stood out included El Diario de los Literatos, which dealt with literary criticism of published books, and El Pensador, created by José Clavijo y Fajardo, who started a kind of costumbrista journalism with typically Spanish themes, such as tertulias and refrescos, courtship, superstition, and behavior in church. It dealt with issues such as the education of both women and men, the role and behavior of teachers, and criticized the autos sacramentales. In the first issues, he used the pen name D. Joseph Álvarez y Valladares. In 1797, the Semanario de Agricultura y Artes appeared, the first 17 volumes of which were published by Juan Antonio Melón. Starting on 4 July 1805, the professors from the Real Jardín Botánico de Madrid Simón de Roxas Clemente y Rubio, Francisco Antonio Zea, and the brothers Claudio Boutelou and Esteban Boutelou got involved. This newspaper was aimed at parish priests so that they would spread agricultural doctrines.\nIn 1786, the Correo de los Ciegos de Madrid was born, which was then known as Correo de Madrid since 1787. Among articles of the current literary, scientific, technical, and economic matters of the era, there were also progressive articles on social criticism and customs by El militar ingenuo, the pen name of Manuel María de Aguirre, an enlightened and radical admirer of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and a consummate critic of the estate society and the political superstructure, according to Antonio Elorza. He longed for the separation of powers and the restructuring of society and decried Juan Bautista Pablo Forner's Oración apologética por España y su mérito literario, criticizing institutions and denouncing injustice, inequality, and ignorance. The Cartas marruecas by José Cadalso were published (posthumously) for the first time in its pages.\nThe most influential of all newspapers (it was copied by figures such as Manuel Rubín de Celis, Pedro Centeno, and José Marchena Ruiz de Cueto) was El Censor by lawyers Luis María García del Cañuelo (of a malcontent and aggressive nature) and Luis Marcelino Pereira (an expert on economic issues) (1781). It had encyclopedist, liberal, regalist, and Jansenist influences, and dared to question legislative and religious policies and principles. It engaged in profound social criticism of institutions and questioned the statist structure of society. Therefore, it had to fight constantly to obtain a printing license and then against censorship and opposition by the conservative power, represented by official apologist Juan Bautista Pablo Forner. The latter was parodied in Oración apologética por la África y su mérito literario. It also published a fake Carta marrueca by Cadalso and the utopia of the Ayparchontes. Despite all of this, it went on to have eight volumes and 167 speeches, although it was put on hold three times and was continued by a series of imitators such as El Corresponsal del Censor, El Observador by José Marchena Ruiz de Cueto, influenced by Jeremy Bentham's utilitarianism, defender of physiocracy and of natural law or jusnaturalism, as well as equally opposed to Fornerian apologists. In fact, according to José Miguel Caso González, El Censor covered up a well-formed enlightened pressure group, those who were habitués of the Countess of Montijo's salon: Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, Juan Meléndez Valdés, Antonio Tavira y Almazán, José de Vargas Ponce, and Félix María de Samaniego. They are the ones responsible for some of the speeches, especially Meléndez and Jovellanos, the latter under the pseudonym Conde de las Claras.\nEl Memorial Literario, in its three eras—since 1784—a monthly publication of 123 pages, was a literary and scientific magazine that was run by Joaquín Ezquerra and Pedro Pablo Trullench and had as its source the Reales Estudios de San Isidro. It combined the defense of national interests with constructive criticism, including interesting scientific news. El Diario de las Musas by Luciano Comella and El Espíritu de los Mejores Diarios by Cristóbal Cladera; El Semanario Erudito by Antonio Valladares de Sotomayor and the Gabinete de Lectura Española by Isidoro Bosarte (which introduced each issue with a \"prologue\")—both from 1787—are compilations of old classic texts such as El Cajón de Sastre by Nifo. Juan José López de Sedano, who collected Spanish literature classics in his anthology Parnaso Español, published El Belianis Literario (1765)— a satire of the publications of the time—under the pseudonym Patricio Bueno de Castilla.\nIn the 18th century, the press is a phenomenon essentially limited to Madrid, Andalusia, Murcia, Valencia, and Zaragoza. The other provinces hardly have anything to report. It is peculiar that Catalonia or the Basque Country do not have many examples from this period either. On 24 February 1791, all unofficial newspapers were banned by a Royal Resolution signed by José Moñino, 1st Count of Floridablanca. This led to protests by the main publishers, who were thus ruined and were angrily demanding economic compensation (a pension) or a job. Only the three official newspapers, Gaceta de Madrid, El Mercurio, and Diario de Madrid, remained. This ban was partly lifted a year later, in 1792, allowing for the publication of El Correo Mercantil de España y sus Indias by Eugenio Larruga and Diego María Gallard, but it remained in effect until 1795. The press would not flourish again in a manner comparable to the 1780s, not until 1808 with the War of Independence.\nThe concept of public opinion ceases to be understood in this period with the sense of fame or reputation. Rather, it designates an attitude of social criticism by the members of the bourgeoisie, who demand more power and political representation through newspaper columns: the press and opinions are clearly a bourgeois phenomenon.\nPaul Guinard, in his La presse espagnole de 1737 à 1791. Formation et significaticon d'un genre, Paris: Institut d'Études Hispaniques, 1973, distinguishes four types of 18th-century press:\n\nPresentative: It persuades readers of the interest of the publication in a personalized manner.\nInformative: It is the voice of the government and thus offers biased or partial information—Gaceta de Madrid, Mercurio Histórico.\nDidactic: The didactic genre aims to educate the reader, sometimes in a picturesque manner, such as with fictional or conventional letters, dialogues, imaginary journeys, utopias—the Monarquía columbina, the Viaje al país de los Ayparchontes, the Zenit, the Sinapia found among the papers of the Count of Floridablanca—allegorical or satirical dreams, and especially speeches and essays, a chain of reflections on a central theme with room for digressions, anecdotes, etc.\nPolemic: It takes part in the controversies of its time, sometimes using parodies, which heightens the comical effect. For instance, the controversy surrounding apologists in Spain.\n\n\n== War of Independence and the reign of Ferdinand VII ==\nDuring the 19th century, the eighteenth-century press—didactic, utilitarian and costumbrista—began to acquire a definite political tinge. The role of the press in the spread of liberal ideas was decisive, although it had to fight tooth and nail with the censorship imposed by the last vestiges of the Ancien Régime, embodied in the person of Ferdinand VII since, after the French Revolution, there was a conservative reaction throughout Europe and absolutism imposed itself again. There was a bout of freedom of the press during the War of Independence (1808–1814) since the Cortes of Cádiz recognized this freedom in 1810 and especially with the decree of freedom of the press of 26 October 1811. Citizens wanted to know what was happening in the sessions of the Cortes, etc. All of this led to the proliferation of periodical publications of various tendencies: liberal newspapers such as Semanario Patriótico by Manuel José Quintana, El Conciso by Gaspar María de Ogirando, or El Robespierre Español by Pedro Pascasio Fernández Sardino; anti-constitutionalists such as El Censor General and even afrancesados, such as the Gaceta de Sevilla, the Diario de Barcelona, or the Diario de Valencia, edited for a while by Pedro Estala.\n\nWith the return of Ferdinand VII of Spain and the reaction of the Manifiesto de los Persas, all journalistic activity was interrupted once again. On 25 April 1815, all unofficial publications were banned. From then on, the stages of repression and freedom of the press alternated, coinciding with the absolutist and liberal periods, respectively.\nDuring the brief period of the Trienio Liberal, revolutionary and exalted (exaltados) political newspapers, such as El Zurriago or La Tercerola, both edited and partially written by Félix Mejía, started to appear next to newspapers controlled by moderates, such as the Miscelánea de Comercio, Artes y Literatura by Javier de Burgos, El Espectador, El Universal, or by afrancesados like José Mamerto Gómez Hermosilla, Sebastián Miñano, and Alberto Lista, who wrote what is probably the most intellectual and dense publication of the period, El Censor.\n\nThis resurgence was also nipped in the bud by the rise of the Holy Alliance with the army known as the Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis in 1823. In 1834, after the death of Ferdinand VII, the liberals who had been expelled in 1823 returned to Spain. These exiles not only brought romantic ideas, but also the new ways of doing journalism of the English: newspapers before 1835 barely included any information at all apart from political or scientific topics. They usually had a small format, were written in a single column, and their overall appearance was rather dull. However, from this date on, others started to appear that looked more like the ones that exist today.\nAlthough almost all of them had a short-lived existence, between 1808 and 1814 there was an abundance of publications, since the press would go on to become an important element of the revolutionary-constitutionalist movement by:\n\nMaking political projects known,\nMaking readers feel that they belonged to the community,\nMaking them aware of the country's problems.\nWith the return of Ferdinand VII in 1814, the so-called Sexenio Absolutista began, during which all of the reforms that had been carried out were ignored and liberal thought was forced to go underground. To speak of journalism in this period was to speak of the official press, since newspapers that had other ideologies had been closed down.\nThe Trienio Liberal (1820–1823) began with the victory in 1820 of Rafael del Riego's uprising in Las Cabezas de San Juan and the swearing-in of the Constitution of 1812 by Ferdinand VII. That same year, the freedom of the press was proclaimed—whereby everything that did not constitute the ordinary press (pamphlets, flyers) went underground—and in 1822 all possible crimes related to the journalistic activity (libel, slander, etc.) were typified. These measures contributed to a sudden wave of printed materials, in which publications that supported the various liberal factions were predominant.\nThe most important mastheads of this period were:\n\nModerate liberals:\nEl Universal, known for its measurements as the sabanón (31 x 21 cm, which was huge compared to the usual size at the time)\nEl Censor, run by Alberto Lista\nEl Imparcial\nEl Periódico de las Damas, from which women were called upon to instill in their children the values of the Constitution. Although (or perhaps because) it broke with the classic nature of women's publications, it failed and no more than three issues were ever published.\nExalted liberals, which introduced an original element in the Spanish press: graphic design (caricatures and jokes with political connotations).\nEl Eco de Padilla, the means of expression of the secret society of the Confederation of Spanish Comuneros or Hijos de Padilla.\nEl Zurriago was a very radical, critical, and satirical newspaper that, with its caricatures, reached the limits of what was permitted.\nIn 1823, with the intervention of the Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis, Ferdinand VII embraced absolutism once again. It was the start of a new period, marked by the censorship imposed during the Ominous Decade or Calomardian Decade, in which the only newspaper that was allowed was the Diario de Avisos de Madrid—a variant or continuation of the first Spanish newspaper, the Diario Noticioso, Curioso, Erudito, Comercial y Político (better known as the Diario de Madrid), founded by the pioneer of journalism Francisco Mariano Nipho in 1758 and that disappeared definitely on 31 December 1814. The Diario de Avisos de Madrid, together with the also official Gazeta de Madrid or Gaceta de Madrid shared the same absolutist and servile style. However, in 1828, the king began a timid policy of liberalization brought on by his need to win over liberals in his fight against his brother, the Infante Carlos María Isidro, to remain in power. From that date on, it was allowed to publish romantic and costumbrista mastheads, which would be a means of expression for liberal thought.\n\nRomantic publications:\nEl Duende Satírico del Día, by Mariano José de Larra, 1828.\nEl Pobrecito Hablador, by Mariano José de Larra, 1831.\nEl Guadalhorce (1839), which was the medium of the movement in Málaga.\nLa Alhambra (1839–1843), who had José de Espronceda as collaborator.\nCostumbrista publications:\nSemanario Pintoresco Español, by Ramón de Mesonero Romanos, 1835.\n\n\n== Reign of Isabella II and the Democratic Sexennium ==\n\nAlthough from 1833 until the Restoration, newspapers would try to be controlled and used by successive governments, it is no less true that it was during this period when democratic ideas (Saint-simonianist utopian socialism) began to appear in the liberal press through articles by certain collaborators. This ideological seepage would continue during the regency of Baldomero Espartero (1840–1843) and the reign of Isabella II (1843–1868). Perhaps the most noteworthy aspect of this period, as far as this topic is concerned, is the birth of informative journalism, the access by the working class to the press, and the appearance of a series of mastheads that have it as their natural recipient. The Faro de Vigo, the oldest newspaper in Spain at the beginning of the 21st century, started to be published in 1853.\nBetween 1868 and 1875 (the reign of Amadeo I and the First Republic), nearly 600 newspapers appeared in Spain. This information boom took place because the revolutionary process began with the freedom of the press, which would be included in the Constitution of 1869.\n\nDespite everything, either in exile or under censorship, the press sparked public opinion and made democratic bourgeois institutions evolve little by little, not only in Europe (the revolutions of 1830 and 1848), but also in Spain (the aforementioned of 1812 and the one in 1868). In Spain, in particular, censorship was applied in an extreme manner against Carlist publications and, at the other end of the political spectrum, against those of the Democratic Party. After the victory of liberalism, all Western countries recognized (around 1881) freedom of expression and passed press laws. On the other hand, technology created new distribution channels, and improvements to the printing press made possible larger, cheaper, and more colorful editions, illustrated with beautiful engravings. In addition, the spread of the reading habit among the lower classes—thanks to public education, which was one of the victories of the bourgeois revolutions, as well as the aforementioned improvements that made the press cheaper—allowed for the press to spread to these classes of society, creating a model known as the mainstream press, with its most visible manifestation being the so-called feuilleton or serial novel. From 1868 onwards, there continued to be opinion newspapers, supporters of a political party or a political leader. However, an informative press evolved to be the most successful among readers and the one that achieved the highest circulation numbers. The external aspect of these newspapers was more entertaining. Their contents were no longer limited to political issues, but also new sections appeared pertaining to literary criticism, puzzles, anecdotes, and humor. They devoted more space to advertising and inserted feuilletons (novels published in instalments, or so-called serial novels), which were very popular among the lower classes.\n\nAfter the revolution of 1868 (La Gloriosa), the Constitution of 1869 recognized freedom of the press and numerous newspapers and magazines started to appear. The boom of Spanish journalism began with the arrival in Spain of the first rotary printing press in 1875, to be used for Rafael Gasset's El Imparcial. This was followed by a series of prestigious publications: El Comercio of Gijón (1877), El Liberal of Bilbao (1879), La Vanguardia of Barcelona (1881), El Noticiero Universal of Barcelona (1888), Heraldo de Madrid (1890), Blanco y Negro of Madrid (1891), and Heraldo de Aragón of Zaragoza (1895)\nIn 1883, the Printing Law established by the liberal government of Práxedes Mateo Sagasta was also favorable to periodical publications. All this, along with more sophisticated technical media, allowed periodicals to experience a real boom (around 600 registered publications) during the Sexenio Democrático.\n\nAlthough the majority of the population was illiterate and print runs were very small (they never exceeded 15,000 copies), they were widely distributed thanks to the tradition of reading aloud, the existence of reading rooms, and the custom of reading newspapers in coffeehouses, ateneos, and tertulias. In Madrid and in the provincial capitals, a wider reading public began to grow as education spread. The women's press started to develop in 1868. After the victory of the 1868 revolution, schools were opened to educate the lower classes and the first workers' newspapers appeared. Then, noteworthy publications emerged, such as La Flaca magazine. The style of La Flaca was copied by other magazines in Madrid and Barcelona, among which stood out: L'Esquella de la Torratxa (1872), La Filoxera (1878), El Loro (1879), La Viña (1880), El Motín (1881) by José Nakens, La Mosca (1881), La Broma (1881), La Tramontana (1881), Acabose (1883), and Las Dominicales del Libre Pensamiento (1883–1909) by Fernando Lozano Montes.\nA well-documented and serious press for elite circles was also developed, represented by El Imparcial (1867) and El Liberal (1879). La Correspondencia de España (1859) stood out as an independent newspaper. El Imparcial did as well, with its literary supplement, Los Lunes de El Imparcial, which published—between 1879 and 1906 and under the management of José Ortega Munilla—works by the most important authors of the time: José Zorrilla, Juan Valera, Ramón de Campoamor, Emilia Pardo Bazán, and Rubén Darío. Los Lunes de El Imparcial also launched to stardom the most important authors of regenerationism and the generation of '98: Miguel de Unamuno, Azorín, Pío Baroja, and Ramón María del Valle-Inclán.\n\n\n== Journalism during the Restoration ==\n\nNewspaper giants started to emerge during the Restoration, favored by those in power, which would serve to support the new political situation.\nStarting in 1880, new media emerged that were quantitatively and qualitatively different from those of the 19th century, which represented the birth of the 20th century information age. Around this time, various Western countries passed bourgeois press laws that recognized freedom of expression and organized their information structure around national news agencies that had close ties to governments and supplied information to newspapers. Under that predominance of news agencies, all media outlets covered the same topics. The birth of news agencies spurred some changes in how information spread: the creation of the global telegraph network resulted in the ubiquity of information and the tendency towards uniformity typical of information in the 20th century, and the press gained objectivity.\n\nAt that time—the late 19th century and early 20th century—the so-called mass press evolved in the United States and some European countries. Newspapers increased their circulation dramatically, they included numerous advertising pages, got established in large buildings, and obtained profits unheard of until then. In addition, they abandoned the old formulas and assumed new roles in 20th-century society: they became goods for use and consumption, sold at low prices, and offered their readers an attractive and well-finished product. Their repeated presence in society turned them into instruments of great influence and this excess of power would allow them to serve as the catalyst for manipulations of all kinds. It is in this context that yellow journalism emerged.\nIn the late 19th century, there was a type of newspaper with characteristics that did not differ much from those of today's newspapers. There was an abundance of information, better, varied, and more extensive, fed by correspondents in each provincial capital and in European capitals, with telegraphic news and sometimes two editions: one in the morning and another in the evening. Newspapers now had a greater variety of sections: accident and crime reports, business, announcements, excerpts of sessions at the Cortes, travels and interviews, daily entertainment section, literary articles, poetry works, short stories, newsletters, critiques.\n\nIn Catalonia, La Vanguardia (from 1881 to the present) was created in 1881 by brothers Bartolomé Godó and Carlos Godó y Pié. In 1896, Rafael Roldós created Las Noticias, which would rival La Vanguardia in Barcelona.\nAccording to statistics from 1887, there were 1,128 newspapers and magazines circulating in Spain that year.\nNewspaper ABC, founded by Torcuato Luca de Tena in 1903, began as a weekly and then became a daily in 1905. It had a magazine format—it was even stapled—and its ideology was monarchist and conservative. El Debate, published by Editorial Católica and created by Ángel Herrera Oria in 1910, defended Catholic ideas. It lasted until the beginning of the Civil War. It was a quality newspaper with political, religious, and cultural concerns. Moreover, it paved the way for the creation of the first school of journalism. El Sol was founded in 1917 by Nicolás María de Urgoiti. José Ortega y Gasset served as the main intellectual inspiration, and Mariano de Cavia and Salvador de Madariaga, among others, collaborated in its pages. El Sol wanted to restore the country's political and social situation by having a sister evening paper, La Voz, which had a more light-hearted tone. La Nación was a newspaper of reference for the right wing between 1925 and 1936. Its workshops were burned down in the violent climate prior to the Civil War. The link between the press and the political parties was sometimes not as clear as it might have seemed:\n\nOne of the most famous press reports in the history of journalism during the Second Republic was the one by Ramón J. Sender on the massacre of anarchists in Casas Viejas for newspaper La Libertad. The value of that series of articles has not changed, but its political significance has done so, taking into account that the Republican newspaper was at the time owned by Juan March and therefore it was quite advantageous to use the event in order to stoke a fire in which the government of Manuel Azaña could burn. A similar thing was happening with leftist newspaper La Tierra, in whose pages collaborated anarcho-syndicalists and communists, going day after day against the regime, duly subsidized by the monarchist right wing for such a holy task.\n\nIt is worthy of note that most of these were business newspapers that—apart from seeking to have an impact on public opinion and defend certain interests and ideologies—sought economic profitability and used advertising as their main means of financing. They can be considered as mass press due to their contents and objectives, but they did not reach the large print runs that characterized foreign newspapers due to the lack of a wide reading public: Spain was still a scarcely urbanized country, with high illiteracy rates. But from 1910 onwards, Spanish newspapers started to evolve into mass newspapers: they began to use a less stilted and more dynamic language, and to present certain lexical and stylistic changes. Moreover, their layout became more attractive, especially with the appearance of photographs. Their contents reflected the tastes of popular culture: public entertainment (football, bullfighting, the theatre, etc.), political events, references to other media (the press and the cinema), a billboard section, etc. There were also special pages or supplements on topics such as economics, variety shows, art, sports, agriculture, women's issues, and children's issues. On the other hand, the impact of the war in Europe increased the interest in foreign issues. Thus, Spanish newspapers were split between those that were partisans of the Allies or pro-Allied and the Germanophiles or pro-Germany. The first women journalists appeared in Spain during this period. Some of those who stood out included Carmen de Burgos, editor of Madrid's Diario Universal; Sofía Casanova, at ABC; and Concha Espina, who worked for Buenos Aires's El Correo Español and now-defunct Spanish newspapers La Libertad and La Nación, as well as Cantabria's El Diario Montañés.\nThere were also newspapers linked to the labor movement, such as El Socialista (of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, PSOE), Tierra y Libertad (of the anarchist Federación Anarquista Ibérica, FAI), Solidaridad Obrera (of the Catalan Confederación Nacional del Trabajo, CNT), or Mundo Obrero (of the Communist Party of Spain, PCE).\n\nAccording to a 1914 statistic, there were 138 periodicals defined as \"far left\" circulating in Spain that year, including two anarchist, 26 socialist, 79 republican, 10 federalist, 3 republican-socialist, 15 radical, and 3 reformist newspapers. On the other hand, the \"far right\" side included 136 publications, among them 89 Catholic, 38 traditionalist or Carlist, and nine fundamentalist papers. There were 79 newspapers defined as liberal, 52 as conservative, 16 as regionalist, and eight as \"undefined monarchist.\" There were also 154 newspapers that defined themselves in politics as \"independent,\" although some of them were considered as monarchist and others as republican, according to the general opinion.\nThe children's press appeared in 1917 with weekly magazine TBO, whose name spelled out (tebeo) has become synonymous in Spain with the genre known worldwide as comic book.\nIn the period between wars, totalitarian movements and ideologies arose in various Western countries (German Nazism, Italian Fascism, Russian Communism, Spanish Francoism, etc.). Two different information models were established: the model of these totalitarian states, based on propaganda as one of the fundamental means to control the masses through biased information and the absolute control of all media, and the model of the hesitant liberal democracies such as England, where freedom of expression was recognized.\nPhotojournalism emerged due to competition from new media such as film, radio, and television. Photographic images were no longer a mere ornament but an alternative language. Media outlets were used as a way to escape from the surrounding reality: they offered 90% entertainment and 10% enjoyable information, and aimed to take readers away from their day-to-day problems.\n\n\n== Second Republic ==\nMuch of the current historiography refers to the Second Spanish Republic as a \"Republic of journalists.\" Indeed, in the Constituent Courts of 1931 there were 47 journalists. After university professors, they were the largest professional group, with the exception of lawyers.\nCertainly, the eventful life of the Second Spanish Republic did not allow it to be an example of immaculate freedom of expression. Censorship continued to operate and repressive measures were widespread. In any case—and especially seen from today's perspective—the newspapers of the time attacked their adversaries with an aggressiveness that would seem inconceivable today. The accumulated violence in Spanish society, of which the press was but a mere reflection, would lead to a definitive rupture: the military uprising against the legally constituted government was to definitively truncate the penultimate attempt at modernizing Spain.\nMost of the major newspapers welcomed with hope the new situation arising from the municipal elections of 12 April 1931. Even among the openly monarchist newspapers, El Debate applied the doctrine of the \"de facto\" government of Leo XIII and accepted the new regime. On the other hand, ABC was reluctant from the very beginning. The provisional government assumed all powers and issued a broad amnesty. The Provisional Legal Statute that was to govern political life until the proclamation of the new Constitution in December 1931 already recognized all individual rights, including, of course, the right of expression, although the government reserved for itself a \"regime of control\" of these rights. Article 34 of the draft bill for the Constitution sanctioned freedom of expression, while Article 10 stated: Corresponde al Estado español la legislación y podrá corresponder a las Regiones autónomas la ejecución en la medida de su capacidad política a juicio de las Cortes, sobre las siguientes materias: (...) 10. Régimen de prensa. Asociaciones, reuniones y espectáculos públicos. As a result of the burning of convents on 11 May, newspapers ABC and El Debate were suspended. The former would reappear on 3 June and the latter, on 20 May.\nShortly after the approval of article 26 of the Constitution, related to the matter of religion—pertaining to the separation of church and state and related matters like intellectual freedom, freedom of religion, and the regulation of marriage and divorce, among others—a draft bill called De Defensa de la República was passed on 24 October. It considered the spreading of news that could disturb the peace and public order as acts of aggression against the Republic. There were numerous fines and suspensions on the right and left wings as a result of this law. Shortly before the proclamation of the Republic, El Sol and La Voz had been acquired by a group of monarchist figures. In any case, both newspapers adhered to the new regime. Within the landscape of the daily press during the period of the Republic, newspaper Ahora occupied a prominent place. It began to be published on 16 November 1930, to coincide with the Republican Jaca uprising. It was established with the clear intention of competing from more progressive positions with newspaper ABC. Although somewhat larger in size, Ahora also printed several pages in rotogravure and its front page was always occupied by an up-to-the-minute photograph. It also displayed, at the beginning, a monarchical loyalty that would later turn into respect for the new republican regime.\nAhora was owned by Luis Montiel Balanzat who, more than a journalist, should be called a newspaper entrepreneur, having started in the paper industry and then in the graphic arts sector. In 1926, Montiel launched literary newspaper La Novela Mundial, which was followed by others and finally, in January 1928, by weekly magazine Estampa. Montiel was also behind one of the most popular Spanish sports publications, weekly magazine As, which appeared in June 1932. Faced with the danger of being overwhelmed by the left or the right, the Republic needed a loyal press. After the Crisol adventure, Urgoiti founded Luz with major participation from the Agrupación al Servicio de la República, with José Ortega y Gasset, Gregorio Marañón, and Ramón Pérez de Ayala. As El Sol and Crisol before it, Luz was going to be run by Félix Lorenzo.\nIn September 1932, El Socialista began to spread the news that, financed by wealthy Catalan business owner Luis Miquel, a journalistic \"trust\" was going to be created with El Sol, La Voz, and Luz. Mexican journalist Martín Luis Guzmán, who had been Pancho Villa's secretary and who had Azaña's ear at the time, put the latter in contact with Luis Miquel. After the failure and the uprising of 10 August, Miquel managed to take over the ownership of El Sol and La Voz, apparently with the threat of implicating their royalist owners in the attempt. On 14 September, Luz announced a \"bid for new capital\" which would energize it, as well as the replacement \"for health reasons\" of director Félix Lorenzo by Luis Bello Trompeta. With Luis Miquel as president of the board of directors and Martín Luis Guzmán as manager, the \"trust\" that grouped the three newspapers was effectively established. In any case, the adventure was going to end in economic failure. Besides, Bello was going to have serious disagreements with the socialist members of government, which would lead to his dismissal as head of Luz on 8 March 1933, causing a difficult crisis in the editorial office: Luis Miquel himself was going to be forced to assume the management and Nicolás Urgoiti, the deputy management. Shortly after, Miquel lost the title to El Sol and La Voz by edict of a Madrid court. The new company appointed Fernando García Vela, a loyal collaborator of Ortega y Gasset, as editor of El Sol, and confirmed Enrique Fajardo (also known by the pseudonym Fabián Vidal) as editor of La Voz. Luz, in whose direction Miquel had been succeeded by Corpus Barga, ceased publication on 8 September 1934.\n\n\n== Civil war ==\nDuring the Civil War, both in the Republican and the Nationalist factions, official institutions were established that were exclusively dedicated to spreading propaganda: the Ministry of Propaganda in the former and the Delegación Nacional de Prensa y Propaganda in the latter. In the geographic area occupied by each side, only loyal newspapers could be published, and they were subjected to strict military censorship. The oddest case was that of ABC: its edition in Seville continued to respond to its traditional ideology, supporting the side of the rebels. Meanwhile, its building in Madrid was expropriated and the newspaper was published with the same masthead, but in support of the Republican cause (controlled by the Republican Union). Moreover, the facilities of El Debate were used to publish Mundo Obrero. There were, however, honest journalists who questioned the violence and absurdity of the war from a purely human perspective, such as democrat Manuel Chaves Nogales, whom both sides wanted to execute.\nThere was a satirical newspaper, La Ametralladora, that was distributed in the rebel trenches. Humorists such as Miguel Mihura and Álvaro de Laiglesia collaborated on the paper, and later both continued during Franco's regime with La Codorniz, which remained the longest-standing publication in the genre until it was surpassed by magazine El Jueves. On the other side, in the republican zone, the more elitist El Mono Azul was published. It included contributions from poets of the Generation of '27.\n\n\n== Francoism ==\n\nThe victors learned from the war that the media had to fulfill the social role of public service. The theory of the social responsibility of the media was then developed. From 1945 to 1970, there was a period of economic expansion that had repercussions on the development of the information sector. Democratic states defended freedom of expression and, at the same time, established media control regulations. At the same time, they became owners of newspapers, radio stations, and public television channels. The information business grew, and information companies increased their power. This was favorable to media concentration—progressively fewer companies owned increasingly more media outlets—despite control by the States that enact antitrust laws. However, while freedom of expression was definitively established in democratic States, this did not represent the situation in Francoist Spain, where the 1938 press law—which was designed to have an iron grip on publications during the Civil War—was maintained.\nDuring World War II, a large part of the Spanish press came to be controlled by the head of propaganda of the German Embassy in Madrid, the pro-Nazi Jew Josef Hans Lazar. The main exponent of this situation was newspaper Informaciones, which became the primary focus of anti-Semitic and pro-Nazi publicity in Spain.\n\nThe most important characteristics of the press during this period were prior censorship and the so-called \"mottos\" through which the Ministry of Information and Tourism could order the insertion of articles, even editorials, with a certain tendency or content. The headlines of Madrid newspapers represented the minimum plurality that was allowed among the regime's various families:\n\nArriba: pro-government, considered the medium of the Movimiento Nacional. It was sometimes used to test the control of one of the families (the gironazo—an article published by José Antonio Girón de Velasco on 28 April 1974).\nHoja del Lunes, the only newspaper that could be distributed on Monday since Sunday rest was mandatory for all others. The Madrid edition was printed in the shops of Arriba (previously in the shops of Ya). It had been published continuously since 1930 by the Madrid Press Association, and there were counterparts throughout Spain (the Royal Decree of 1 May 1926 granted the various press associations the capability to publish them in order to cover the needs of their associates). They ceased to be published in the 1980s, when newspapers began to appear every day.\nEl Alcázar: far right—what came to be known as the Búnker—except for a brief liberal period between 1966 and 1969; first published by a company with ties to Opus Dei and, from 1975 onwards, by the Confederación Nacional de Ex Combatientes.\nYa: Catholic—which in the First Francoism meant National Catholicism and after the Second Vatican Council distanced itself from the regime—successor of El Debate; loosely controlled by the Bishops' Conference and the Asociación Católica de Propagandistas, inspired by journalist and cardinal Ángel Herrera Oria.\nPueblo: with close ties to the Spanish Syndical Organization—which in the First Francoism meant national syndicalism and in its final stage went on to be considered, in some manner, \"pro-worker\"—led in that last period by Emilio Romero, who flirted with left-wing opposition circles without abandoning Falangism. It was the most read newspaper in Spain after La Vanguardia and ABC.\nABC: owned by the Luca de Tena family, conservative and monarchist, with the presence of Luis María Anson, who would end up running it. Franco's decision for the succession to the Spanish throne to go to Juan Carlos de Borbón instead of his father Juan de Borbón—exiled in Estoril—put a strain on the regime's relationship with the newspaper, which was seized on occasion (1966). ABC was the Madrid newspaper with the largest circulation, surpassed only by La Vanguardia at a national level.\nMadrid: the one that ended up showing the greatest determination to defy the regime, taking advantage of the timidly liberal atmosphere of Manuel Fraga's press law (1966). In spite of this, it ended up being fined and closed down in 1971. Its building was demolished with a spectacular explosion.\nInformaciones (newspaper): an evening newspaper that was considered the most progressive, after the closure of the daily Madrid. Forges' cartoons were famous.\nCambio 16: weekly magazine published from 1971 with a liberal orientation, both in an economic and political sense. During the last two years of the dictatorship, it became the most progressive newspaper in Spain and achieved an enormous increase in its circulation.\nTriunfo: magazine published between 1946 and 1982, founded and run throughout its existence by José Ángel Ezcurra. It started as an entertainment weekly but turned into a general information magazine in its heyday in 1962, soon becoming the intellectual benchmark of Spain at that time.\nApart from the very active press in Barcelona (where La Vanguardia and Solidaridad Obrera were renamed La Vanguardia Española and Solidaridad Nacional), in other provinces there were many newspapers, among them El Norte de Castilla, ran by Miguel Delibes, and where Francisco Umbral began his journalistic career.\n\n\n== The 1966 press law and the independent press ==\nDuring the early years of Francoism, the press was tightly controlled by the Ministry of Information and Tourism through the censorship mechanisms established by the 1938 press law, a situation that began to change in 1962. It was this year that Minister of Information Gabriel Arias-Salgado was dismissed because of international criticism of his press campaign against the participants in the so-called Contubernio de Múnich. He was succeeded by Manuel Fraga Iribarne, at that time considered one of the most liberal representatives of the regime. In the following years, Fraga promoted a new press law, approved in 1966, which abolished prior censorship and mottos. However, this liberalization was only partial, since the publication of certain opinions, for example, open criticism of the regime, remained forbidden. In addition, there was reinforcement of the principles of civil and even criminal liability of any editor who violated the provisions of the law. Thus, the intention was to replace the system of prior censorship with a system of self-censorship by the newspapers themselves.\nNevertheless, in the following years, several newspapers tried to explore the limits of this new freedom of expression through provocative texts and more or less covert criticism of the regime. In this context, newspapers Madrid, El Alcázar, and Nuevo Diario were particularly important. The three newspapers, which formed the self-styled independent press, were run by liberal-leaning members of Opus Dei who tried to take advantage of the ties of this Catholic organization to liberalize the regime (despite the fact that Opus Dei ministers were indeed part of the most conservative core within Franco's cabinet). However, from 1968 onwards, the defiance of the independent press to the regime caused dramatic reactions by the Ministry of Information, which finally led to changes in the publishing companies of newspapers El Alcázar and Nuevo Diario in 1969 and to the closure of Madrid in 1971.\nAfter Fraga's dismissal as Minister of Information in 1969, censorship and newspaper seizures grew again in intensity. Nonetheless, in the last years of the regime, more established newspapers (such as La Vanguardia and, to a lesser extent, ABC and Pueblo) also took advantage of the relative liberalism of the press law to diversify the political discourse and criticize the regime's policies, albeit always in a moderate or underhanded manner. Thus, at the time of Franco's death, newspapers were the place where the most controversial and important political debates in the country held. While political institutions such as the Cortes were still controlled by the orthodox sectors of the regime, the press had become, according to an expression of the time, a \"paper parliament.\"\n\n\n== Humor and escape ==\n\nDuring the Francoist period, there was a flourishing of children's periodicals, with TBO surviving among them. In the fifties, other children's magazines appeared as well, such as: Pulgarcito, Tío Vivo, and El DDT, from Editorial Bruguera (a refuge for many adults), and Pumby or Jaimito, from Editorial Valenciana, and others. Some were clearly politically framed within the regime, such as Flechas y Pelayos. The evolution of La Codorniz (intellectual in origin, coming from Falangism, the artistic avant-garde currents, and surrealism) towards a bitter and disenchanted sort of humor brought it more than a few problems with censorship, and gave way in the seventies to other adult humor publications that continued to push the envelope of what was allowed, from a clearly progressive position: Hermano Lobo (magazine), El Papus, and in 1977, El Jueves, the longest-standing humor magazine in Spain.\nA special role was played by the press that was considered less serious or more popular, which could be compared to the escapist role played in literature by subgenres (the Western novels of Marcial Lafuente Estefanía or the romance novels of Corín Tellado), and in radio by the radio dramas (Ama Rosa, Simplemente María), a genre in which Guillermo Sautier Casaseca stood out. Although much less than the media that evolved later, the escapist press was predominantly sensationalist, with its reliance on photographs and, depending on the case, color, and glossy, higher quality paper. El Caso focused on accident and crime reports, concentrating on the most sordid aspects, and pushing the limits of good taste as far as the censorship allowed. The readership of weekly gossip magazines was predominantly made up of women. Apart from its broad distribution, it reached a massive casual or regular reading public in doctors' offices and hairdressing salons, where discussions were often held to comment on its contents. It was segmented (in both price and social standing) into an aristocratic version (¡Hola!, 1944-, which also has international versions) and other more popular ones (Diez Minutos, 1951-, or best-selling Pronto, 2014-). Also important are Semana (1940-) and Lecturas (1917-), the longest-standing of the Spanish gossip magazines.\n\n\n== Transition and democracy ==\n\nThe year 1970 marked the beginning of a crisis that ushered in the information society in which we are living today. The development of new technologies had an impact on all media outlets. There was a clear predominance of US agencies and television networks. Many states that maintained public media outlets went on to privatize them, leaving them in the hands of large business groups (PRISA, Grupo Zeta, Grupo Godó, Grupo Correo, Prensa Española, these latter two merged in September 2001 into Grupo Vocento).\n\nIn Spain, after the transition to democracy, the press experienced a major boom with the appearance of all kinds of publications. Apart from newspapers with a long-standing history, such as ABC or La Vanguardia, new ones appeared, like El País (Grupo Prisa, thought to have close ties to the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party) or El Mundo (deemed to have close ties to the People's Party), which soon turned into solid media companies and power groups. Others were more short-lived, such as Diario 16, which emerged from the transition of magazine Cambio 16. It was in this newspaper that Pedro J. Ramírez started his career as director, later going on to work at El Mundo. Other newspapers were created more recently, such as La Razón—very conservative leaning, originally run by Luis María Anson, who had left ABC due to disagreements with the ownership and who ended up also leaving his new newspaper after having made it grow quite successfully. Luis María Anson and Juan Luis Cebrián (at that time directors of ABC and El País) were simultaneously (in 1996) appointed full fellows of the Royal Spanish Academy, in what was seen as a recognition of the contribution to the language by the written press and an attempt by the institution to appear neutral in the media and political debate.\nIn Barcelona, other newspapers emerged, in addition to the traditional La Vanguardia (from Grupo Godó, considered non-nationalist and conservative). These included El Periódico de Cataluña (from Grupo Zeta, considered non-nationalist and progressive), and Avui (with ties to Catalan nationalism). In the Basque Country, there were El Correo (formerly known as El Correo Español-El Pueblo Vasco, from Vocento group, considered non-nationalist and conservative), Deia (with ties to the Basque Nationalist Party), and Egin—closed by court order for its ties to ETA and because some journalists who were published in it were also prosecuted, such as Pepe Rei—whose space was occupied by Gara, also belonging to Herri Batasuna.\nAs has been the case throughout the Modern Age, the list of journalists with high literary quality is very extensive, with names such as Antonio Gala, Francisco Umbral, Miguel Delibes, Gabriel García Márquez, Carlos Luis Álvarez, Fernando Savater, Raúl del Pozo, Almudena Grandes, Juan José Millás, José Antonio Marina, Rafael Sánchez Ferlosio, Mario Vargas Llosa, Jorge Edwards, Gabriel Albiac, Jorge Berlanga, Antonio Burgos, Miguel García-Posada, David Gistau, Luis Antonio de Villena, Manuel Hidalgo Ruiz, Eduardo Mendicutti, Rosa Montero, Javier Ortiz, Carmen Rigalt, Manuel Vázquez Montalbán, Vicente Verdú, Manuel Vicent, Espido Freire, Lucía Etxebarría, Francisco Nieva, Juan Marsé, José Luis Alvite, Pedro García Cuartango, Julián Lago, José Luis Gutiérrez, Alfonso Ussía, Juan Manuel de Prada, Manuel Martín Ferrand, Alfonso Armada, Alfonso Rojo, Arturo Pérez-Reverte, Félix de Azúa, Javier Marías, Mónica Fernández Aceytuno, Ignacio Camacho, as well as columnists who introduce arguments in the debate of ideas in society: Jaime Campmany, Eduardo Haro Tecglen, José Luis Martín Prieto, and others.\n\nThe presence of the written press in the events of recent years has not been exclusively as a reflection of reality, but often anticipates and provokes it: the most famous journalistic scandals had to do mostly with campaigns led by El Mundo (under the guise of investigative journalism) regarding the last socialist governments of Felipe González for cases of corruption (the Guerra case, the Filesa case, and the Luis Roldán case). The newspaper also played an important role in exposing paramilitary group GAL and its so-called \"dirty war\" when it published a comprehensive series of articles. Moreover, it also reported on the controversies about the 2004 Madrid train bombings. Luis María Anson made statements in which he attributed the fall of Felipe González to a journalistic campaign conceived between himself and other journalists such as Pedro J. Ramírez, and which ended up taking José María Aznar all the way to the presidency.\n\nThe traditional format of the written press has been challenged in recent years by the appearance of two new competitors: the spread of the Internet and electronic publishing (being a substantial part of the model of La Marea and Público, as well as Eldiario.es), and alternative media outlets such as blogs and, secondly, the rise of free newspapers, distributed in the streets and not in the usual places such as newsstands (20 minutos, Metro, ADN, Qué!). Less successful was a newspaper conceived as a method of social integration for homeless people, who acted as salespersons as an alternative to begging (La Farola).\n\n\n=== Leading newspapers today ===\n\n\n==== General interest ====\nEl País\nEl Mundo\nABC\nLa Razón\nLa Vanguardia\n\n\n==== Sports ====\nMarca\nDiario AS\nSport\nMundo Deportivo\nL'Esportiu (in Catalan)\n\n\n==== Economic ====\nExpansión\nCinco Días\nEl Economista\n\n\n==== General interest in provinces or autonomous regions ====\nEl Periódico de Catalunya: it has two versions—Catalan and Spanish—and has offices in Barcelona, Catalonia, the Balearic Islands, the Valencian Community, Andorra, and La Franja of Aragón\nAra: the most read daily newspaper written exclusively in Catalan; with offices in Barcelona, Catalonia, the Balearic Islands, the Valencian Community, Andorra, and La Franja of Aragón\nEl Correo: with offices in Bilbao, Biscay, Gipuzkoa, Álava, Navarre, Lower Navarre, Labourd, Soule, Valle de Villaverde, Comarca del Ebro, Treviño enclave, Miranda de Ebro\nEl Diario Vasco: with offices in San Sebastián, Gipuzkoa, Biscay, Álava, Navarre, Lower Navarre, Labourd, Soule, Valle de Villaverde, Comarca del Ebro, Treviño enclave, Miranda de Ebro\nEl Diario Montañés: Cantabria\nLa Verdad: Murcia\nIdeal: Eastern Andalusia (Almería, Granada, and Jaén)\nHoy: Extremadura\nDiario Sur: south of Andalusia (Málaga, Axarquía, Marbella, Costa del Sol, Melilla, Gibraltar)\nLa Rioja: La Rioja\nEl Norte de Castilla: Castile and León, mainly Valladolid, Palencia, Segovia, Salamanca\nEl Comercio: Asturias\nLas Provincias: the Valencian Community\nLa Voz de Cádiz: Cádiz\nHeraldo de Aragón: Zaragoza, Aragon\nEl Periódico de Aragón: Zaragoza, Aragon\nDiario de Navarra: Pamplona, Navarre\nDiario de Noticias de Navarra: Pamplona, Navarre\nLa Provincia: Las Palmas, Canary Islands\nCanarias7: Las Palmas, Canary Islands\nÚltima Hora: Palma de Mallorca, Balearic Islands\nDiario de Mallorca: Palma de Mallorca, Balearic Islands\nLa Tribuna de Albacete: Albacete, Castilla-La Mancha\nDiario de León: León\nEl Día de Valladolid: Valladolid\nLa Gaceta Regional de Salamanca: Salamanca\nDiario de Burgos: Burgos\nLa Opinión-El Correo de Zamora: Zamora\nDiario Palentino: Palencia\nDiario de Ávila: Ávila\nEl Adelantado de Segovia: Segovia\nHeraldo-Diario de Soria: Soria, sold along with El Mundo throughout Soria Province)\nLa Voz de Galicia: A Coruña, Galicia\nNós Diario: Santiago de Compostela, Galicia\nDiario de Pontevedra: Pontevedra\nFaro de Vigo: Vigo, province of Pontevedra\nEl Progreso: Lugo\nLa Región: Ourense, Galicia\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of journalism\nHistory of newspaper publishing\nList of the oldest newspapers\nContemporary history of Spain\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==",

After graduating from Niigata High School, he played for the team of Hokuriku University.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== Japan and Thailand ===\nAfter graduating from Hokuriku, Kobayashi joined Artista Asama in the Japanese regional leagues in 2015. After one year, he joined lower tier Thailand side Nakhon Phanom, marking his first professional contract. He would transfer to Surat Thani in the Thai League 3 the year after before departing in 2018.\n\n\n=== Cambodia ===\nIn 2018, he would go to Cambodia to sign for league heavyweights Svay Rieng as their AFC player quota. His good performances led to his contract getting extended twice, until he departed the club in 2022, joining rivals Phnom Penh Crown before leaving the club shortly after.\n\n\n=== Trialing for Persija Jakarta ===\nKobayashi would leave Cambodia and try out for the first team of Liga 1 side Persija Jakarta, playing two matches in the President's Cup in 2022. However, he didn't make the cut, and rejoined the Cambodian league later that year with National Defense Ministry.\n\n\n=== Loyola ===\nAfter leaving Tiffy Army, Kobayashi would go to Japan to pursue coaching. In 2024, he signed with Philippines Football League side Loyola as one of their foreign reinforcements for the 2024 season.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 1855 Camden & Amboy rail accident was a derailment that took place near Burlington, New Jersey on August 29, 1855. While attempting to avoid collision with another train, a Philadelphia-bound express was reversing when it collided a horse-drawn cart resulting in the rear passenger train coaches to derail and shatter into pieces. 24 people would die as a result of the crash.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAlthough one train would derail and result in the entirety of the casualties, a second train was involved setting off the chain of events that would result in the accident. The first train involved was a train that had left from New York City at 8:00 a.m. en route to Philadelphia. The other train was a Philadelphia passenger that had left at 10:00 a.m. that was sharing the same line as the New York, but going in the opposite direction. \n\n\n== Accident ==\nAt 11:02 a.m., near Burlington, New Jersey the Philadelphia train noticed the oncoming New York train and braked to prevent a head-on collision. After coming to a complete stop, the Philadelphia train then began to reverse in an effort to pull into a siding so that the New York train could pass. As the Philadelphia train reversed, it struck a horse-drawn carriage, instantly killing the horses, but also damaging the train's axles. The carriage itself was being driven by a doctor who managed to escape the wreck.\nThe engineer, unaware of what had just happened, resumed reversing the train, but at this point, the back-most coaches, including an emigrant car began to derail. As the wooden cars began to derail, they started getting smashed into each other which would be the primary cause of the fatalities. Four coaches would derail in total.\n\n\n=== Response ===\nResidents and farmers from the town of Burlington, as well as those who were uninjured in the crash, quickly emerged on scene and started removing the dead and injured from the wreckage. Doctors as far away as Philadelphia were dispatched. A special train from Mount Holly was also dispatched to carry the injured closer to Burlington where the homes of residents were used for medical treatment. The dead were collected and placed at the Burlington Town Hall.\n\n\n=== Casualties ===\nA total of 24 passengers would die as a result of the crash. Eyewitness reports described a grim scene of mangled bodies that were shredded and torn up in some cases. The majority of the dead were reported to be male, with a total of four women perishing in the disaster. Around 80 others were wounded.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\n\n=== Legal response ===\nThe immediate trial following the derailment was plagued with several legal issues. The doctor who was believed to responsible for the crash could not be located in the days following the accident, delaying the investigation. The court and jury would also sustain issues such as the foreman of the jury later being revealed to have been a passenger on the train and another juror being a Camden & Amboy stockholder. The doctor, John F. D. Heineken, would receive partial blame for his carriage being on the tracks at the time, but the majority of the fault would be placed on the brakeman of the train for his failure to prevent the collision. Three of the jurors refused to agree with the verdict; one of these three was the stockholder. The Camden & Amboy rail company would compensate the victims with half a million dollars.\n\n\n=== Safety improvements ===\nThis accident, as well as the Great Train Wreck of 1856 were instrumental cases in improving rail safety. Train companies and rail lines began expanded train lines to be dual track systems that were parallel to each other to prevent single-line collisions. Automatic Train Stop (ATS) systems would also be implemented 25 years later to help prevent further collisions.\n\n\n== References ==",

Faturrahman scored a total of five league goals for the campaign where his team finished in fifth position.\nFaturrahman scored five further goals including a hat-trick against BAKES FC at the 2021 Brunei Super League before the league was abandoned due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He briefly left for further studies at the Ma’had Qiraat Al-Shoubra in Cairo, Egypt in October 2022. He returned in the middle of the 2023 Brunei Super League campaign, registering three goals for the Rangers as they finished third, seven points behind runaway champions Kasuka FC.\n\n\n=== DPMM ===\nIn March 2024, Faturrahman was announced on DPMM FC's website to be one of several new local players to join the professional club for the upcoming 2024–25 Singapore Premier League.\n\n\n== International career ==\nFaturrahman was called up by Mario Rivera in February 2024 and was subsequently brought to Saudi Arabia for the newly created 2024 FIFA Series in the following month. He made his international debut as a second-half substitute in a 2–0 defeat to Bermuda on 22 March 2024.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nKota Ranger\nBrunei FA Cup: 2018–19\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nFaturrahman is also a qari and has competed in local and international Qur'an recitation competitions.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Francis Harris (1 December 1829 – 3 September 1885) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHarris was the son of a hat manufacturer. He was born on 1 December 1829 at Winchester Row, Southwark, and was baptised in St. Saviour's, Southwark. He was educated at King's College, London, and at Caius College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1852, and, after studying medicine at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, M.B. in 1854. He lived for a time in Gray's Inn, and in November 1856 became house-surgeon to the Children's Hospital in Great Ormond Street, London. In 1857 he became a member of the Royal College of Physicians, and soon after went to continue his studies, first in Paris, and afterwards, under Rudolf Virchow, in Berlin. After a year abroad his foreign studies concluded with a short visit to Prague and Vienna, and on his return to London he took to the practice of obstetrics, because he could see no other opportunity of practice; but in 1858 he was elected demonstrator of morbid anatomy at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and in May 1859 assistant-physician to the Children's Hospital in Great Ormond Street. In that year he took his M.D. degree at Cambridge. His thesis, which was published, was ‘On the Nature of the Substance found in the Amyloid Degeneration of Various Organs of the Human Body.’ In this he described two cases of amyloid disease of the liver and two of the kidneys, which were the only cases he had met with in sixty post-mortems made at St. Bartholomew's; these were the first elaborate descriptions of the disease by an English morbid anatomist. He attained some reputation from this work, and never published any other. In 1861 he abandoned midwifery and was elected assistant-physician to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and in the same year lecturer on botany; and in August 1861 married his second cousin, Marianne Harris. In 1865 he bought an estate at Lamberhurst, Kent, a district he had liked from boyhood, and here many guests and all his neighbours used to enjoy his kindly hospitality and pithy conversation. He cultivated pineapples, oranges, and orchids. A dendrobium and a calanthe, hybrids which he produced, are called after him. He became subject to bronchitis, resigned his physiciancy in 1874, became more and more of a valetudinarian, caught cold while fishing in Hampshire, and died at his town house, 24 Cavendish Square, of pneumonia of both lungs, on 3 September 1885. He was buried in the churchyard of Brenchley, Kent. His astuteness as a physician was extraordinary, and his kindness to younger physicians unbounded. His hair began to grow grey when he was sixteen, and when he was labouring under his fatal illness, in the prime of life, he looked an old man.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1891). \"Harris, Francis\".

        "content": "Studio We: Recording is the first demo album by the South Korean band Onewe. The album was released by RBW on October 15, 2020, and distributed by Kakao M. It consists of nine tracks, including the pre-released single \"Parting\" and its instrumental, along with CD-only demo versions of \"Parting\" and other songs from the band's previous releases.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nOn September 11, 2020, Onewe released a music video teaser for a new song \"Parting\". The song was then revealed for the first time through a live performance at the band's O! New E!volution concert on September 12.\nWritten by member Kanghyun, \"Parting\" is inspired by a dream he often had as a child of an asteroid falling to Earth, and the lyrics convey the sincerity he could not convey to his loved ones on this last day before the asteroid hit. \"Parting\" was introduced as Kanghyun's sequel to his lead single \"Regulus\" from the band's single album 2/4. These became known as Onewe's \"planet series\", with the Korean word for planet (행성) included within both the titles of \"Regulus\" (Korean: 야행성; RR: Yahaengseong, literally \"nocturnal\") and \"Parting\" (Korean: 소행성; RR: Sohaengseong, literally \"asteroid\"). The series was then developed further with the addition of later releases into what has now become known as Onewe's \"space series\".\nOn September 21, it was confirmed that Onewe would officially release \"Parting\" on September 24. The song was released as a digital single along with its music video at 6pm KST. On the same day, RBW revealed the album details for the band's first demo album Studio We : Recording. \"Parting\" was included as the lead single for Studio We : Recoding which was released as a physical album on October 15, 2020.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Parting\" pre-release\n\nStudio We : Recording demo tracks\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "A Titus cut or coiffure à la Titus was a hairstyle for men and women popular at the end of the 18th century in France and England. The style consisted of a short layered cut, typically with curls. It was supposedly popularized in 1791 by the French actor François-Joseph Talma who played Titus in a Parisian production of Voltaire's Brutus.\nThe Titus cut was considered a radical departure from the large elaborate hairstyles and wigs that were popular during the last quarter of the 18th century. As a simple \"classical\" style, free from aristocratic excess, it was associated with the French Revolution and popular among those who supported it. Although initially a men's style, it was soon adopted by women as well. The Journal de Paris reported in 1802 that \"more than half of elegant women were wearing their hair or wig à la Titus.\" The style spread to England as well, where it was often called coiffure à la guillotine in reference to the beheadings of the French Revolution. Although the style remained popular into the 19th century, by the 1810s it had fallen out of fashion.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of hairstyles\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Titus haircut at Wikimedia Commons\n\"Coiffure à la Titus\" at shannonselin.com",

        "content": "Robert Harrington (fl. 1815) was an English eccentric writer on natural philosophy, and physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHarrington became a member of the Company of Surgeons of London before 1781. He practised at Carlisle, where in 1810 he resided in Abbey Street (Picture of Carlisle, 1810, p. 131), and was still alive in 1815. Harrington was a believer in Phlogiston, and attempted to discredit Antoine Lavoisier's theory of combustion and other discoveries. He published:\n\n'Philosophical and Experimental Inquiry into the First and General Principles of Life,' London, 1781 (Monthly Review, lxvi. 98).\n'Thoughts on the Properties and Formations of different kinds of Air,' London, 1785 (ib. lxxiv. 449).\n'Letter … to Dr. Priestley, Messrs.\nCavendish, Lavoisier, and Kerwan … to prove that their … opinions of Inflammable and Dephlogisticated Airs forming Water, and the Acids being compounded of different Airs, are fallacious,' London, 1786.\n\n'A Treatise on Air: containing New Experiments and Thoughts on Combustion; a full investigation of M. Lavoisier's System … proving … its erroneous principles,' London; 1791 . This work was published under the pseudonym of 'Richard Bewley, M.D.' (ib. 2nd ser. vi. 435, xiv. 462).\n'Chemical Essays … with Observations and Strictures on Dr. Priestley,' &c., London, 1794 (ib. vi. 435).\n'A New System on Fire and Planetary Life, showing that the Sun and Planets are inhabited, and that they enjoy the same Temperament as our Earth : also an Elucidation of the Phenomena of Electricity and Magnetism,' 1796, 8vo (ib. xxii. 107).\n'Some New Experiments, with Observations upon Heat … also Letter to Henry Cavendish, esq.,' London, 1798.\n'Experiments and Observations onVolta's Electric Pile. … Also Observations on Dr. Herschell's Papers on Light and Heat,' Carlisle, 1801.\n'The Death-warrant of the French Theory of Chemistry With a Theory fully … accounting for all the Phenomena. Also a full … Investigation of … Galvanism, and Strictures upon the Chemical Opinions of Messrs. Weiglet, Cruickshanks, Davy, Leslie, Count Rumford, and Dr. Thompson; likewise Remarks upon Mr. Dalton's late Theory and other Observations,' 1804, 8vo.\nAn Elucidation and Extension of the Harringtonian System of Chemistry, explaining all the Phenomena without one single Anomaly,' London, 1819. The Harringtonian system of the atmosphere was defended and developed in the *'Medical Spectator,' 1794, attributed to Dr. John Sherwin (Nichols, Lit. Anecd. ix. 150). Harrington's critics speak of his uncouth style and desultory reasoning.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Rigg, James McMullen (1890). \"Harrington, Robert\".

        "content": "The Polish Inquisition was an ecclesiastical institution established in the 13th century to combat heretics. Permanent structures of the inquisition in Polish territories were established in the first half of the 14th century and always played a subordinate role to episcopal tribunals, which were already combating heretics in Poland in the mid-13th century. The final end of the existence of inquisitorial tribunals came with the Reformation and the victory of the idea of religious tolerance in Poland in the second half of the 16th century.\nGeographically, the jurisdiction of Polish inquisitors included territories within the Gniezno metropolitan province (including Silesia, and from the late 14th century also Lithuania) and Prussia, but did not include (except for a brief period in the 1460s) Western Pomerania, which, according to the bull of Boniface IX from 1399, was under the jurisdiction of inquisitors from the German province of Saxony. Meanwhile, Red Ruthenia, although it belonged to the Polish state from 1340 (with a brief interruption during the reign of Louis I of Hungary), until the mid-15th century formed a separate unit within the territorial structures of the papal inquisition.\n\n\n== History of the inquisition in Polish lands ==\n\n\n=== Anti-heretical repressions in Poland until 1318 ===\n\nIn Poland in the 12th and 13th centuries, there were no recorded instances of the mass heretical movements present in the West and South of the continent (such as the Cathars or Waldensians). Only in 1261 did the flagellants, a non-orthodox penitential movement, reach Polish lands. As can be inferred from chronicle references, the Church pacified this movement without triggering a larger-scale repression apparatus. Archbishop of Gniezno, Janusz Tarnowa, forbade the flagellants' processions under penalty of excommunication and imprisonment, and these regulations were approved by secular authorities. Most likely, the vast majority of flagellants complied with these prohibitions.\nIt was only at the beginning of the 14th century that the Waldensian movement began to penetrate Silesia (probably from Bohemia). A Waldensian community was discovered in 1315 in Świdnica. Bishop of Wrocław, Henryk of Wierzbna, ordered a large-scale repressive action. He appointed his auxiliary bishop Paweł as the chairman of the tribunal. As a result of the action, a large number of individuals suspected of belonging to this group were captured in Wrocław, Świdnica, and Nysa. Around 50 people were burned at the stake, and many others had to flee. At the same time, repression against the Waldensians also took place in Austria and Bohemia.\nThe persecution of the Waldensians in Silesia in 1315 was the work of the bishop's tribunal, not the papal inquisition, which did not exist in Polish lands at that time. However, these events may have influenced Pope John XXII's decision to appoint papal inquisitors for Polish dioceses.\n\n\n=== 14th century (since 1318) ===\n\nOn 1 May 1318, Pope John XXII appointed the Dominican Peregrine of Opole and the Franciscan Mikołaj Hospodyniec as inquisitors for the dioceses of Wrocław and Kraków. Nine years later, in April 1327, John XXII issued further regulations, granting the Polish provincial superior of the Dominicans the authority to appoint inquisitors throughout the entire Polish province, and called on the Polish king and episcopate to support the inquisitors. This regulation, confirmed by Pope Eugene IV in 1432, became the basis for the functioning of the papal inquisition office in Poland. Both inquisitors appointed in 1318 either resigned or were dismissed from office, and from then until the time of the Reformation, this office was held exclusively by Dominicans.\nThe papal regulations from 1318 to 1327 probably had a preventive character and were not associated with an increase in heretical activity in Polish lands. The persecution of the Waldensians in Silesia by the episcopal courts in 1315 was most likely effective and did not require support from the papal inquisition. This is also evidenced by the fact that the Dominican provincial did not rush to appoint new inquisitors in place of Peregrine of Opole and Mikołaj Hospodyniec. The new inquisitor for Kraków was appointed no earlier than 1328, and for Wrocław in 1330. In the 1330s, inquisitors were also appointed for Greater Poland, which was not under the jurisdiction of the inquisitors appointed in 1318, as well as for the Teutonic Order state, as Prussia belonged to the Polish Dominican province.\nDespite the papal inquisition's jurisdiction over all Polish lands, almost all specific information about its activities in the 14th century comes from Silesia, which politically was not part of Poland from 1327 onwards but a fief of the Czechs. In 1332, the Wrocław-Lubusz inquisitor Jan Schwenkenfeld conducted a trial against 16 Beguines from Świdnica, suspected of adhering to the so-called \"Brethren of the Free Spirit\". A few years later, this inquisitor became involved in a conflict between Bishop of Wrocław Nanker and the Wrocław city council on the side of the former, which ended in his murder in 1341. In 1349, another wave of flagellants passed through Polish lands, condemned by Pope Clement VI. Their leader in the Wrocław diocese was burned at the stake on the orders of Bishop Przecław of Pogorzela. Around 1380, houses of Beguines and Beghards were confiscated in Silesia, and in 1398, a supporter of John Wycliffe's teachings was burned in Wrocław.\nThere is almost no information about inquisition trials in the Kingdom of Poland in the 14th century. Although the 16th-century historian Matthias Flacius claimed that around 1330, Poland, together with Bohemia, was the scene of a major inquisition action against the Waldensians, a more detailed analysis of Flacius's text and his sources has questioned this view. The German inquisitor Peter Zwicker noted around 1395 that one of the countries untouched by Waldensian teachings was the Kingdom of Kraków.\n\n\n=== 15th century ===\nThe activities of Wycliffe and Jan Hus caused unrest in academic circles in Europe, including Kraków. Kraków's inquisitor, Piotr, attempted to counter the spread of \"suspect\" ideas and, in 1408, obtained an edict from King Władysław II Jagiełło obligating secular authorities to cooperate with the inquisition. In 1413, Jerome of Prague, a close associate of Jan Hus, nearly fell into the hands of Inquisitor Piotr while in Poland but was warned in time and fled to Lithuania.\n\nAfter the Council of Constance, where Jan Hus was burned at the stake in 1415 and Jerome of Prague in 1416, the Polish episcopate took steps against the spread of their ideas in Poland and sought royal support in this regard. Resolutions of the provincial synod in 1420 condemned Hussites and mandated faithful to denounce all suspects to the inquisitors, and in subsequent years, reminders of these resolutions were regularly given in sermons and resolutions of subsequent synods. On 9 April 1424, King Władysław Jagiełło issued the so-called Edict of Wieluń, declaring the confession of Hussites a crime against majesty. In 1436, 1454, and 1463, papal inquisitors received royal privileges requiring all subjects to assist them in combating heresy.\nInquisitors Mikołaj of Łęczyca and Jakub Grzymała participated in trials of suspected Hussites in the Poznań and Płock dioceses, for example, from 1439 to 1443, Mikołaj of Łęczyca interrogated Hussites from Zbąszyń, the main center of this faith in Greater Poland. The protector of Hussites in this region was nobleman Abraham Głowacz of Zbąszyń (died in 1441), who eventually reconciled with the church shortly before his death. Generally, however, anti-heretical activity in the Kingdom of Poland was predominantly carried out by episcopal courts, while the role of papal inquisitors was at best auxiliary. Of the nearly 200 cases of heresy recorded in sources in 15th-century Poland, almost all were adjudicated by episcopal courts, although sometimes the inquisitor also participated in the questioning of witnesses and suspects. Only in five cases was a verdict issued jointly by the inquisitor and the bishop, acting together as co-judges. Only a dozen or so verdicts were issued by inquisitors without the participation of the bishop. Even the trials of Hussites from Zbąszyń in the 1440s, in which Inquisitor Mikołaj of Łęczyca played an active role, were initiated by the Bishop of Poznań, Andrzej Bniński, who personally interrogated many suspects and issued or approved verdicts.\nNext to Andrzej Bniński, Bishop of Kraków Zbigniew Oleśnicki (died in 1455) is considered the main \"persecutor\" of Polish Hussites. He served as regent of the Kingdom of Poland after the death of Władysław Jagiełło in 1434, pursuing a radically anti-Czech and anti-Hussite policy. Part of the nobility led by Spytko III of Melsztyn opposed his rule and sympathized with Hussites. However, when in 1439 they formed a confederation and revolted against Oleśnicki, they were defeated in the Battle of Grotniki. Less is known about Oleśnicki's inquisitorial activity against Hussites because the records of the Kraków episcopal court before 1466 have not survived.\nThe subordinate role of inquisitors in combating heresy, as deduced from surviving procedural records, is indirectly confirmed by the fact that for many serving in the 15th and early 16th centuries, being an inquisitor was only an additional function. They were dedicated to studies or held various administrative positions in the order, serving as priors of monasteries, and sometimes even as provincial superiors. When in 1465 the Polish provincial chapter, under pressure from the order's authorities, passed a ban on combining the offices of prior and inquisitor, it turned out that this issue affected four inquisitors then in office: Jakub Grzymała, prior of Płock, Grzegorz Hejncze, prior of Wrocław, Wincenty Wierzbięta, prior of Poznań, and Mikołaj Grüneberg, prior of Toruń. Apparently, these resolutions were not consistently enforced. In 1478, Wojciech of Siecień obtained a dispensation from the order's general, Leonardo Mansueti, allowing him to combine the offices of Kraków inquisitor and provincial.\nThe last significant trials against Hussites in Poland took place in Kuyavia. In 1480, Bishop of Kuyavia Zbigniew Oleśnicki (died in 1493) interrogated several people, of whom he found six guilty of heresy. In 1499, Bishop Krzesław Kurozwęcki sentenced clergyman Adam of Radziejów to death for refusing to renounce heresy.\nThe lack of church documentation seriously hinders the assessment of the activity of the inquisition (both papal and episcopal) in the 15th century in Silesia, which belonged to Bohemia at that time. In 1420, a Prague burgher named Jan Krasa was executed in Wrocław for confessing Hussites, but the sentence was issued by the papal legate Fernando de Palacios and the Czech-German king Sigismund of Luxembourg, who were present in the city at that time. In the 1420s and 1430s, Silesia became a battleground between Catholics and Hussites. Many cases are recorded in the sources where individuals suspected of pro-Hussite sympathies were punished by secular authorities as traitors. However, it is difficult to determine the extent of the inquisition's involvement in these events. One of the few sources mentions that may refer to the activity of the Silesian inquisition in the 15th century is the information from Zygmunt Rosicz's chronicle about the burning of Peter of Leśnica, an advocate of the local diocesan consistory, in Wrocław in 1437. Another significant legacy is the theological and preaching work of Jan of Ząbkowice, the inquisitor of Wrocław from 1429 to 1441, who died in 1446.\nThe dissolution of the Dominican missionary congregation Societas Fratrum Peregrinantium in 1456 resulted in the transfer of the inquisitorial tribunal in Ruthenia under the authority of the Polish provincial of the Dominicans.\n\n\n=== 16th century ===\n\nThe final period of the existence of inquisitorial tribunals in the Polish lands is the least researched. A critical catalog of papal inquisitors from the 16th century has not been compiled to date. However, it is undisputed that at the beginning of this century, the monastic authorities continued to regularly appoint inquisitors, and they performed their functions. For example, in 1508, the Kraków inquisitor Mikołaj from Żnin sentenced a Jew accused of blasphemy to the stake, and a year later, Johann Tetzel from the Głogów convent was appointed as the inquisitor of the Polish province. Furthermore, the area of activity of Polish inquisitors expanded to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, where in 1507, the prior of Vilnius, Piotr from Sochaczew, acted as an inquisitor. Nevertheless, when after 1517 the ideas of Martin Luther began to spread in many regions of the country, the main burden of combating them was taken up by the bishops. The resolutions of provincial synods from the years 1527, 1532, 1542, and 1551 called for decisive steps against heresy, but entrusted its eradication solely to episcopal inquisition. In 1539, in Kraków, the episcopal court sentenced Katarzyna Weiglowa to be burned at the stake for denying the dogma of the Holy Trinity and adopting Judaism.\nThe resolutions of the bishops' synod in 1542 established that only inquisitors appointed by the bishops could operate within the metropolitan provinces of Gniezno and Lviv. In at least some dioceses, bishops established their own subordinate inquisitorial tribunals. For example, in 1541, the Carmelite Jan of Kazimierz became the inquisitor in Kraków, in 1546, the Dominican Paweł Sarbin in Poznań, and in 1557, the local canon Jan Bielecki in Przemyśl. Paweł Sarbin (d. 1563), the Poznań diocesan inquisitor, showed great determination in summoning Protestants before the court, but he did not achieve significant success in this field due to the resistance of the nobility and townspeople.\nThe activity of the episcopal inquisition in the long run was unable to stop the spread of Reformation ideas due to the lack of support from secular authorities and the determined resistance of a significant part of the higher social strata. Although King Sigismund I the Old (d. 1548) and initially his son Sigismund II Augustus (d. 1572) issued edicts against Lutheranism, they were not respected. The nobility and municipal authorities refused to cooperate with ecclesiastical courts in combating heresy. Moreover, many clergy, including bishops, sympathized with Protestantism. For example, Bishop Jan Drohojewski of Kuyavia handed over a church to Lutherans in Gdańsk and was regarded as a crypto-Protestant. In 1552, Pope Julius III even instructed the Kraków inquisitor Jan from Kazimierz to initiate proceedings regarding the religious views of the primate at the time, Mikołaj Dzierzgowski, and the Bishop of Chełmno, Jakub Uchański. The final end of the activity of inquisitorial tribunals in Poland came with the resolutions of Sejm from the years 1552–1573. In 1552, Sejm exempted the nobility from the jurisdiction of ecclesiastical courts, and from 1562 to 1565, it passed a ban on the execution of sentences by secular authorities. Finally, the Warsaw Confederation of 1573 established religious tolerance for Protestant denominations.\nIn the Dominican historiographical tradition, several monks are mentioned who were supposed to serve as inquisitors even during the reign of King Sigismund Augustus, despite synodal and parliamentary resolutions. The last of them, Melchior of Mościska, died only in 1590. If this information is accurate (which is uncertain), there is nothing to indicate that the titles of inquisitors were anything more than honorary distinctions for these monks, as actual heresy trials were conducted before diocesan courts. Contemporary historian Paweł Kras accepts the year 1552 as the date of the abolition of the Dominican inquisition in Poland.\n\n\n== Statistics of trials and executions ==\n\nSeventeenth-century Dominican historiographers outlined a very broad scope of activity of papal inquisitors in Poland. Many pieces of information about alleged trials and executions of heretics in Polish lands from the beginning of the 14th to the mid-16th century were provided by Vincenzo Maria Fontana, followed by the 19th-century Dominican historian Sadok Barącz. The apologetic nature of Fontana's work, whose main goal was to glorify the achievements of his own order in the fight against heresy, his very liberal treatment of sources (e.g., frequent \"enrichment\" of earlier authors' accounts), rich rhetorical style, and a high level of generality in most accounts, and above all, confrontation with contemporary sources, make most historians consider the descriptions of Polish inquisitors' actions contained in his work as unreliable. Henry Charles Lea (1825–1909) dedicated very little space to the activity of the inquisition in Poland in his monumental history of the medieval inquisition, mentioning it only incidentally when discussing the activity of the inquisition in Bohemia. Almost all preserved documentation regarding anti-heretical repressions in Polish lands pertains to episcopal courts. Mentions of the activity of papal inquisitors are sporadic and very often only indicate the participation of the inquisitor in a trial conducted by an episcopal court.\n\n\n=== Trials of the Papal Inquisition ===\nRelatively the most information about the Papal Inquisition comes from Silesia, although even here it is quite limited and almost exclusively from the 14th century. Inquisitor Jan Szwenkenfeld conducted an investigation against the Beguines of Świdnica in 1332. Sixteen suspected members of the community were interrogated, who confessed to heresy. Unfortunately, it is not known what sentences were passed; contemporary sources do not record any executions, but it is likely that the Beguine convent in Świdnica was dissolved. Eight years later, the same inquisitor arrested a priest named Marcin of Wrocław on charges of heresy. Again, it is not known how the trial ended. In 1398, inquisitor Jan of Gliwice burned a certain Stefan, a follower of Wycliffeanism.\nFrom the territory of the Kingdom of Poland, most of the preserved information concerns the activity of two inquisitors appointed for the northern dioceses of the Kingdom of Poland: Mikołaj z Łęczycy (1427–1450) and Jakub Grzymała (documented in office from 1454 to 1466). Mikołaj of Łęczyca worked in the Gniezno archdiocese in 1438 and then from 1439 to 1443 in the Poznań diocese in collaboration with Bishop Andrzej Bniński. His participation in the trials of ten suspects from the Zbąszyń area is noted, including two who had previously been absolved by him, Miklasz of Gniezno and Jakub of Wroniawy, who relapsed into heresy and were sentenced to imprisonment. Out of these ten cases, Mikołaj absolved the suspects and imposed penance on them in five cases, jointly with the bishop in four cases, and in one case, he only participated in the interrogations and was present during the ceremony of renouncing heresy by the accused, but he did not formally participate in issuing the verdict. Jakub Grzymała conducted a trial in the Płock diocese in September 1457 against the vicar Mikołaj of Bulkowo and an unnamed woman; the vicar was imprisoned, while the woman was imposed penance. In 1466, he sued the priest Marcin of Strzegowo on charges of heresy, but Marcin ignored the summons, and the further course of the case is unknown. Perhaps a little earlier, around 1453, Jakub Grzymała conducted trials against Hussites in Kraków, where even death sentences could have been handed down. Fontana claimed this, and although contemporary sources do not confirm this information, there are indications that Fontana's account may be trustworthy. According to Abraham Bzowski, even in the early 17th century, there was a volume of trial records of this inquisitor in the Kraków convent. However, such documentation has not been found to date, and Bzowski himself did not discuss the content of these records.\nKrakow inquisitor Piotr Kantor conducted at least two proceedings on heresy. In 1410, he investigated the case of the cleric Mikołaj, accused of practicing in magic and astrology, as well as impersonating a clergyman. The case most likely ended with referral to the papal curia for judgment. Shortly afterward, Piotr Kantor initiated proceedings against Canon Jan of Lganów of the Jelita coat of arms, who, however, evaded appearing. Presumably, the inquisitor issued an ex parte judgment against him, sentencing him to deprivation of church benefits.\nAnother Kraków inquisitor, Jan Polak, conducted two trials against the Czech Henryk of Brzeg, the royal court astrologer, in the 1420s, accused of heretical magic. The first time (before 1428), the inquisitor granted him absolution and admonition. However, in 1428, he was again brought to trial, this time jointly conducted by Inquisitor Jan and Bishop Zbigniew Oleśnicki of Kraków. The astrologer was sentenced to \"eternal imprisonment\".\nPrussian Inquisitor Piotr Wichman in 1430 accused the Teutonic Order's parish priest from Toruń, Andrzej Pfaffendorf, of favoring Hussites. This case quickly turned into a political dispute between supporters of the Teutonic Order's authority and its opponents, ultimately leading to the temporary expulsion of Dominicans from Toruń. The process lasted several years and involved the Apostolic See. Eventually, Pfaffendorf had to renounce his beliefs.\nIn April 1508, Kraków Inquisitor Mikołaj of Żnin sentenced a Jew accused of blasphemy and desecration of the Host to be burned.\nThe above, rather modest and probably far from complete tally of documented actions of the Papal Inquisition (about 40 proceedings, two confirmed executions) constitutes only a fraction of the actual anti-heretical activities in the Polish lands. These were mainly conducted by episcopal courts.\n\n\n=== Trials of the Episcopal Inquisition ===\nThe investigation against the Silesian Waldensians conducted by inquisitors appointed by Bishop Henry of Wrocław in 1315 was the first and most bloody proceeding of this kind in the Polish lands. Although fragmentary preserved documentation confirms only five executions (four in Świdnica and one in Nysa), chronicle records indicate that the actual number of burned individuals amounted to around 50.\nIn 1319, Bishop Gerward Leszczyc of Kuyavia accused the Beghards from the convent in Kaszczorek near Toruń of heresy. Two Beghards were burned, and the entire convent was dissolved two years later. In 1349, Bishop Przecław of Wrocław sentenced the leader of the Flagellants movement in his diocese to be burned.\nIn the 15th century, about 200 cases of heresy were recorded in the Kingdom of Poland, almost all of which were adjudicated by episcopal courts. Most of them ended with absolution granted to the suspects and the imposition of church penance. Executions occurred in nine cases, six of which took place in the Poznań diocese and three in the Kuyavian diocese. Hardly any records of heresy trials from the Kraków diocese have survived, and there are many indications that it was an area of particularly intense activity of church courts against Hussites, especially during the rule of Bishop Zbigniew Oleśnicki (1423–1455). Additionally, one can count the execution of the Hussite Piotr of Leśnica in Wrocław in 1437, mentioned in one of the chronicles.\nThe anti-heretical activity of episcopal courts during the Reformation period has not yet been summarized. However, it seems that the only execution took place in Kraków in 1539, where the townswoman Katarzyna Weiglowa was burned at the stake, accused of embracing Judaism and denying the dogma of the Holy Trinity.\n\n\n=== Inquisitorial activities of papal legates ===\nOn March 1420, in Wrocław, the Prague citizen Jan Krasy was burned at the stake, becoming one of the more well-known Hussite martyrs. However, the inquisitorial court in his case was presided over not by the local bishop Konrad of Oleśnica or inquisitor Jan of Gliwice, but by the papal legate Fernando de Palacios, the Bishop of Lugo, who was then present in Silesia and called for a crusade against the Czechs. The death sentence was personally approved by the Czech-German king Sigismund of Luxembourg, who was in Wrocław at the time with the legate.\nFrom 1453 to 1454, anti-Hussite and anti-Jewish sermons were preached in Wrocław and Kraków by the legate and apostolic commissioner Jan Kapistran, who served as the general inquisitor in the Franciscan Order. During his stay in Wrocław in 1453, 41 Jews accused of ritual murder and desecration of the Host were burned, although his direct involvement in these persecutions is not entirely clear.\n\n\n=== List of executions of heretics from the judgment of the Inquisition courts ===\n\n\n=== Executions of heretics on the basis of verdicts of local authorities ===\nThe above list must be supplemented by several executions of heretics recorded in sources in the 1420s by local authorities without the involvement of an inquisitor or bishop. It is known that in Poznań around 1425/1426, the city authorities burned two individuals based on charges of heresy brought by the Carmelites. Arbitrary actions also occurred in Silesia, which was engulfed in armed conflict. In 1427, the abbot of the Cistercian monastery in Krzeszów, on the border between Silesia and Bohemia, burned three Hussite farmhands at the stake.\n\n\n== Papal inquisitors in Poland (1318–1542) ==\n\nThe following lists include all known and documented papal inquisitors operating in the territory of the Polish inquisitorial province, whose boundaries did not correspond to political borders. They are arranged chronologically up to the year 1542, when the synod of Polish bishops decreed a ban on the activities of inquisitors who did not have episcopal mandate within the metropolitan sees of Gniezno and Lviv. Although Dominican tradition also mentions several inquisitors appointed after this date, these accounts have not been critically verified so far.\n\n\n=== Inquisitors of Kraków and Wrocław in the years 1318–1327 ===\nPeregrine of Opole OP (1318–1327)\nMikołaj Hospodyniec OFM (mianowany w 1318)\n\n\n=== Inquisitors of Kraków (after 1327) ===\nStanisław of Bochnia OP (1328?–before 1337)\nStanisław of Kraków OP (documented in 1344)\nPiotr Kantor OP (documented 1403–1414)\nMikołaj of Pniewy OP (documented in 1419)\nJan Polak OP (documented 1422–1428)\nMikołaj of Brzeście OP (documented 1437–1463?)\nMarcin Kaczer OP (1463–1477)\nWojciech of Siecień OP (1478–1502)\nMikołaj of Żnino OP (documented 1505–1530)\n\n\n=== Inquisitors of Wrocław (after 1327) ===\nJan Szwenkenfeld OP, inquisitor of Wrocław and Lubusz dioceses (1330–1341)\nWincenty OP (documented in 1346)\nJan Strachota OP (documented 1356–1369)\nOtto OP (documented in 1378)\nJan of Gliwice OP (1397–1428)\nJan Melzer of Ząbkowice OP (documented 1429–1441)\nHenryk Krelker OP (documented 1444–1450)\nGrzegorz Hejncze OP (1461–1483)\nJan Wójcik OP (appointed in 1500, d. 1520)\n\n\n=== Inquisitors of Greater Poland and Mazovia ===\nMikołaj OP, inquisitor of Greater Poland (documented in 1339)\nMikołaj of Łęczyca OP, inquisitor of Gniezno and Poznań dioceses (1427–1450) and Włocławek and Płock dioceses (documented 1439–1450)\nJakub Grzymała OP, inquisitor of Gniezno and Płock dioceses (documented 1454–1466), Poznań and Włocławek dioceses (documented 1454–1461) and Chełmno diocese (appointed in 1461)\nWincenty Wierzbięta OP, inquisitor of Poznań diocese (appointed in 1461, d. 1494), from 1469 auxiliary bishop of Poznań\nWojciech of Sochaczew OP, inquisitor of Poznań diocese (appointed in 1505, d. 1529), from 1506 auxiliary bishop of Poznań\n\n\n=== Inquisitors of Prussia ===\nWilhelm OP, inquisitor of Prussia (documented 1333–1335)\nPiotr Wichman OP, inquisitor of Włocławek, Chełmno, Pomesania and Warmia dioceses (1429–1438)\nMikołaj Grüneberg OP, inquisitor in Toruń (documented in 1465)\nMaciej Floris OP, inquisitor of Chełmno diocese (d. 1482)\nIn 1550, Pope Julius III, entrusting Bishop Stanislaus Hosius of Chełmno (later Bishop of Warmia and Cardinal) with pastoral care over the Pomesanian diocese in Lutheran Duchy of Prussia, which belonged to the Riga metropolitan province and had been without a Catholic bishop for over 20 years, granted him the title of \"inquisitor of heretical perversity\" for the area of that diocese in one of the documents.\n\n\n=== Inquisitors of Ruthenia (after 1456) ===\nThe inquisitorial tribunal for Ruthenia, based in Lviv, existed since 1381; however, initially, it was not under the provincial of the Polish Dominicans but under the vicar of the Dominican congregation of missionaries Societas Fratrum Peregrinantium.

        "content": "Ebenezer Gilchrist (1707 – 12 June 1774) was a Scottish physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGilchrist was born at Dumfries in 1707, studied medicine at Edinburgh, London, and Paris, and graduated at Rheims. In 1732 he returned to Dumfries, where he practised with a reputation which extended beyond the locality, until his death, on 12 June 1774. He became known by reviving certain modes of treatment which he found in the ancient writers. In his first papers on nervous fevers (typhus), published in the ‘Edinburgh Medical Essays and Observations,’ vols. iv. and v. (1746–8), he recommended the use of wine and warm baths. His best known work, ‘The Use of Sea Voyages in Medicine’ (1756; 2nd edit., with a supplement, 1757; 3rd edit. 1771; French transl. 1770), contains a very full analysis of the benefits of sea-exercise and sea-air, especially in consumption, together with cases. The analytical or theoretical handling of the subject is judicious and has hardly been surpassed, but the experience is meagre, and limited too much to short voyages. In the ‘Essays Physical and Literary’ (vol. iii. 1770, and reprint 1770), he published an account of the symptoms and circumstances of the sibbens, the endemic form of syphilis among the poor in the west of Scotland, said to date from the Cromwellian occupation. His other papers are a defence of inoculation for small-pox, an account of the epidemic catarrh (influenza) of 1762, and on cases of vesical hypertrophy, all in ‘Essays, Physical and Literary,’ vols. ii. and iii.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Creighton, Charles (1890). \"Gilchrist, Ebenezer\".

        "content": "Rizhao Yuqi Football Club (Chinese: 日照宇启足球俱乐部), currently known as Rizhao Yuqi Huaxin (Chinese: 日照宇启华信) due to sponsorship reasons, is a Chinese professional football club based in Rizhao, Shandong, that competes in China League Two, the third tier of Chinese football. Rizhao Yuqi plays its home matches at the Rizhao International Football Center, located within Donggang District.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2014, Rizhao Yuqi were initially formed by amateur footballers. After a number of retired footballers joined the club, the club started participating in provincial or national competitions, being dominant back-to-back Rizhao Football League champions, and winning a Shandong FA Cup title. In 2017, the club entered the 2017 Chinese FA Cup qualifying round, although a draw and two losses saw Rizhao Yuqi finish bottom of their group, failing to advance to first round proper. After winning the Rizhao Championship League in 2021, Rizhao Yuqi were qualified to compete in the 2022 Chinese Champions League. They were drawn into a group with Dalian Duxing and Changchun Golden Kirin, and after picking up a win over Changchun Golden Kirin and a loss to Dalian Duxing, Rizhao Yuqi advanced to the elimination round. With the aggregate score at 2–2, Rizhao Yuqi prevailed on penalties over Yingkou Chaoyue to advance to the finals. After all seven matches, Rizhao Yuqi found themselves bottom of their group, only managing to pick up a single point.\nWith an overall 15th place Chinese Champions League finish in the previous season, Rizhao Yuqi re-entered the 2023 Chinese Champions League. Rizhao Yuqi played on home soil as the Chinese FA chose Rizhao as a host region, and after a 1–1 draw with Binzhou Huilong, Rizhao Yuqi qualified for the final round for a second consecutive time. In this period, the club also played a Chinese FA Cup tie, losing 6–1 at home to China League Two club Chongqing Tonglianglong. Drawn with Shenzhen Juniors and Xi'an Chongde Ronghai in the final round, Rizhao Yuqi finished fourth in the group of eight. It set up a knock-out tie with Dalian Huayi, which Rizhao Yuqi won 3–2 on penalties, advancing into the second round. On 28 October 2023, Rizhao Yuqi then faced off against Guangxi Hengchen in the second round of the knock-out stage; a win would mean guaranteed promotion to China League Two. A 5–4 defeat on penalties saw Rizhao Yuqi finish 6th, missing out on promotion.

        "content": "Franc Dillon (June 1891 - unknown) was a film journalist during the period of classical Hollywood cinema and the golden age of Hollywood. Dillon was a socialite, clubwoman, and friend of actor Harold Lloyd and his wife Mildred Davis Lloyd, helping them launch the Beverly Hills Little Theatre for Professionals that was part of a national little theatre movement. It became an important showcase for young actors hoping to be discovered, and for New York stage veterans who wanted to be seen in Hollywood. As a publicist and advertising executive, she negotiated with film production companies to guarantee some of the earliest product placements in films.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nShe was born Franc (possibly Frances) Newman in Michigan, the daughter of Florence Groesbeck and Frank Newman. Some sources give her maiden name as Franc Tait, the surname of her mother's second husband. Franc may have lowered her age by four years when she moved to Los Angeles, because the 1930 census shows a birth date of 1895 rather than 1891, the latter of which is reflected on her marriage license. She had a full brother surnamed Newman, and two half siblings surnamed Tait.\n\n\n== Journalism ==\nShe published features in the leading movie magazines of the day, including Photoplay, Modern Screen, and Picture Play. She was often in the society pages, for example in the Los Angeles Times as a frequent name in Myra Nye's \"Society of Cinemaland\" column, or the page \"Of Interest to Women.\" Dillon's decision to write about a new talent and how to showcase that person could have an effect on how they were received. She was also a correspondent for newspapers across the country promoting Hollywood to the masses, for example publishing a two-page spread in what was then known as the Atlanta Constitution showing movie stars like Al Jolson, Ann Dvorak, and Joel McCrea engaging in farm work to show that they could relate to everyday people. From 1928 to 1935 she was also a Hollywood correspondent and columnist for the Brooklyn Standard-Union, later the Times-Union.\n\n\n== Publicity profession ==\nThe publicity field, along with society and gossip columns, gave women a measure of power and control in a town more conventionally run by men. With screenwriter Katherine Albert of MGM and others she led the Women's Association of Screen Publicists (WASPs), a group that formed in October of 1924. In 1928 Dillon was listed in The Film Spectator as working for the Charles S. Dunning publicity firm. Sometimes she hosted events that might now be called publicity stunts, such as having a 1928 peanut-shelling party at her home where the WASPs worked their way through 300 pounds of them to benefit charity. Later, in the late 1930s and 1940s she worked for the J. Walter Thompson advertising company as part of a noted all-woman team headed by Maxine Smith.\n\n\n== Clubwoman ==\nWomen in Hollywood also formed clubs which gave them collective strength. One of Dillon's earliest clubs was a branch of the Soroptimists, formed in 1922 when the international organization was just a year old. In 1927 she was listed in Film Year Book as vice president of the WASPs, with Elizabeth Riordan as president. She may have been small in stature, for The Clubwoman yearbook of 1928 described the Soroptimists' fourth annual style show at the Biltmore in Los Angeles, with many women in costume, where \"Little Franc Dillon in bell hop attire was flying about seating folk.\" She was founding president of the Screen Women's Press Club (SWPC), beginning in 1930. They often met in the Munchers Club, a café on the Fox movie studio lot. SWPC should not be confused with the Hollywood Women's Press Club founded in 1928 by Louella Parsons and Myra Nye, although the groups overlapped and were sometimes considered functionally the same. She was also chair of the Publicity Club, which met at the Nickodell on Argyle, a famous old Hollywood restaurant.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOn October 24 1914 she married silent film actor Edward Dillon, known as Mary Pickford's first leading man, who also directed for D. W. Griffith for nine years. Actor John T. Dillon was her brother-in-law. It is unknown when the marriage ended, but in the 1930 census Franc Dillon is listed as divorced at age 35, with her mother living in her home. Edward Dillon died of a sudden heart attack in 1933, and news reports said she went to his funeral. In the 1940 census she is listed as widowed rather than divorced. \nIn 1931 she showed a one-year-old white, black, and tan wire fox terrier with the show name Sidlaw Bandit Queen.\n\n\n== Partial list of feature articles (in progress) ==\n\n\n== References ==",

It is the only alternative school operated by the Cherokee County Schools, opening in 2017, after the closure of its predecesor, Mountain Youth School. The school was originally established as Mountain Youth Center, re-named Mountain Youth School, and had operated from its opening in 1997 to its closing at 20 years in 2017. In 2017, MYS closed its doors and re-established as The Oaks Academy at a new location, the former Marble Elementary School building. TOA moved in 2023 to the new Cherokee County Schools of Innovation.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the summer of 1997, the North Carolina General Assembly set forth an allocation of more than $10,000 to establish the Mountain Youth Center. The name was changed in the 2004–2005 school year to Mountain Youth School.\nIn early 2017, Cherokee County Schools closed Marble Elementary School. That same year, the Mountain Youth School closed at its Martins Creek location. MYS later moved in to the recently closed MES building and re-established as The Oaks Academy.\nIn 2023, the school moved once again to a brand new location, the Cherokee County Schools of Innovation. This new facility is home to TOA, Tri-County Early College, and a new Cherokee County Schools Career Academy.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "J. Smith Futhey (September 3, 1820 – November 26, 1888) was an American historian and presiding judge of the 15th judicial district comprising Chester County, Pennsylvania, from 1879 until his death. \n\n\n== Life and career ==\nFuthey was born and raised in West Chester, Pennsylvania, eldest of five children born to Margaret (née Parkinson) and Robert Futhey. The family was of Scotch-Irish ancestry. Futhey's great-grandfather, Samuel Futhey, held three enslaved people as of 1780. His cousins included state legislator Samuel Futhey Dale. \nFuthey studied law briefly at Dickinson College, read law, and gained admittance to the Chester County bar on February 7, 1843. He practiced law for decades and became \"one of the most distinguished men in Chester County.\" He served as president of the Penn Mutual Fire Insurance Company of Chester County in the 1870s and served as a founding director of the National Bank of Chester County in 1864.\nIn February 1879, William Butler resigned as presiding judge of the Chester County Court of Common Pleas to accept an appointment to the federal bench. On February 27, 1879, Governor Henry M. Hoyt appointed Futhey to fill the remainder of Butler's term. In November 1879, Futhey was elected to a full ten-year term without opposition. He was the district's sole judge for most of his time in office, and his death was blamed on overwork. He died in office on November 26, 1888. William Bell Waddell was appointed on December 4 to finish his term. The county bar eulogized his integrity, industry, and benevolence. \nHis remains were interred in Oaklands Cemetery outside West Chester. Pallbearers include William Butler, William Bell Waddell, Washington Townsend, and many other local dignitaries and elected officials.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nFuthey was an enthusiastic and competent amateur historian, and with Gilbert Cope, he authored History of Chester County, Pennsylvania, with Genealogical and Biographical Sketches (Philadelphia: Louis H. Everts, 1881). \"It is to him [Futhey] that the people of Chester County, as well as historians generally, are mainly indebted for information in regard to the early history of the county in all its varied lines,\" wrote Wilmer W. Thomson in 1898. In 1899, the Daily Local News described the monograph as \"one of the most valuable works ever produced within the county.\" Writing in Pennsylvania History in 1972, Harry Whipkey remarked that Futhey and Cope's book \"has long been a valuable tool for genealogists, researchers and historians interested in the early history of Chester County.\"\nWith his friend William Darlington, Futhey published \"Notae Cestrienses,\" consisting of commentaries about notable people from Chester County, in the form of a column in a local newspaper. His other publications include \"History of Upper Octorara Presbyterian Church\" (1870), \"History of Educational Institutions of Chester County\" (1877), and \"Historical Address on the 100th Anniversary of the Paoli Massacre\" (1878).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to J.

        "content": "Walter Harris (1647 – 1 August 1732) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHarris was born in Gloucester in 1647. He was a scholar of Winchester College, and thence went to New College, Oxford, of which society he was elected a fellow in 1666. He took his B.A. degree on 10 October 1670. Soon after he joined the church of Rome, resigned his fellowship, and went to study medicine in France. He graduated M.D. at Bourges on 20 July 1675, and settled in London in 1676. Three years later, during the commotions about a popish plot, he published ‘A Farewell to Popery,’ 1679, and soon after was incorporated M.D. at Cambridge. He was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians 30 September 1682, was five times censor, four times (1699, 1707, 1713, and 1726) Harveian orator, and treasurer from 1714 to 1717 inclusive. From 1710 to 1732 he delivered the Lumleian lectures at the College of Physicians. His first medical book was published in 1683, ‘Pharmacologia Anti-Empirica, or a Rational Discourse of Remedies both Chymical and Galenical,’ and gives a popular account of the six great remedies, mercury, antimony, vitriol, iron, bark (quinine), and opium, with explanations of the nature of several superstitious remedies, such as broth in which gold had been boiled for consumption, amulets, and charms. A very empty essay on the causes of gout is intercalated, with no discoverable reason but that the Duke of Beaufort, to whom the whole work is dedicated, was threatened with attacks of that disorder. Harris was physician in ordinary to Charles II in 1683, and soon after the revolution he was appointed physician to William III, and in 1694 attended Queen Mary in her last illness. He has described (Observations on several grievous Diseases) the stages and appearances of the hæmorrhagic eruption of small-pox, of which she died, and mentions that he sat up with her throughout the night succeeding the sixth day of her disease. She died two days later, and he was present at the post-mortem examination of her body. King William took him with him to Holland on his campaign there, and probably talked to him of gardening, as on his return Harris published ‘A Description of the King's Royal Palace and Garden at Loo,’ London, 1699. While in Holland he published at Amsterdam (1698) ‘De morbis acutis Infantum,’ a work which acquired a reputation beyond its merits, was translated into English (1742), French (1730), and German (1713), and was not supplanted by any other work in England till the publication in 1784 of the much more valuable treatise of Michael Underwood. It is written in imitation of Thomas Sydenham, whom Harris knew and admired, but it lacks the sound basis of long clinical observation which makes Sydenham's work of permanent value. When Harris asked Sydenham for advice as to his medical studies, the great physician is said to have told him to read ‘Don Quixote,’ meaning that he should learn from Cervantes how accurate a knowledge of man may be gained by observation. (Dr. Johnson tells the same story of Richard Blackmore, who also applied to Sydenham for advice.) Harris did not possess sufficient ability to profit by Sydenham's counsel. In 1707 he printed his Harveian oration, and in 1720 published in London ‘De morbis aliquot gravioribus Observationes,’ of which the most interesting part is his account of Queen Mary's illness and death. ‘De Peste Dissertatio,’ London, 1721, and ‘Dissertationes Medicæ et Chirurgicæ habitæ in amphitheatro collegii regalis medicorum Londiniensium,’ 1725, are his remaining medical works. The dissertations are his Lumleian lectures, and contain much praise of Sydenham, but very little original observation. In 1727 he published a short theological treatise, ‘The Works of God.’ He died on 1 August 1732 at his house in Red Lion Square, London.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1891). \"Harris, Walter (1647-1732)\".

        "content": "The Viking of Van Diemen's Land: the stormy life of Jorgen Jorgensen is a 1954 Australian book by Frank Clune and P.R. Stephensen about Jørgen Jørgensen.\nThe book was originally written by P.R. Stephenson after extensive research; he was paid £1,000 for the job by Frank Clune. The originally manuscript ran to 400,000 words. Angus and Robertson refused to publish it until it was cut down and Frank Clune did the work. Stephenson was unhappy with the result.\nAccording to Clune's entry in the Australian Dictionary of Biography the book \"was thought to have more in common with historical novels than history; Clune and...  Stephensen were taken to task for passing off conjecture as fact in the life of Jorgen Jorgenson. The book had come from notes which Clune had made over eighteen years and from the work of researchers employed on contract, and was written up in a dramatic manner. With its impressive bibliography, it illustrates Clune's strengths and weaknesses: an ability to ferret out information, but a desire to embroider it.\"\nThe Newcastle Herald said \"Clune and Stephensen seem too ready to excuse Jorgensen many of his faults,\nbut altogether they have written a fascinating book about a fascinating person.\"\nThe Herald said \"The book is written In a much more lucid and graceful style than one usually associates with Mr Clune.\"\nThe Daily Mirror said the authors \"seem to have a gift for history rather than literature and have managed to write an uninteresting book about a most interesting personality.\"\nStephenson defended the book against critics.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nViking of Van Diemen's Land at AustLit",

He was a pupil of Mr. Cline, sen., at the same period with Astley Cooper, but on his fathers death he bought a commission in the 1st foot. Going to the West Indies, he married Miss Duncan, his colonel's daughter, but relapsed into intemperate habits, and took to writing as a refuge from starvation. He was admitted M.D. at Aberdeen on 24 October 1791, and licentiate of the London College of Physicians in 1792. He was appointed a physician to the army by the influence of Cline and Astley Cooper, but did not mend his habits, and finally died of diseased liver. He wrote:\n\n'Medicinæ Praxeos Compendium,' 1799.\n'The Modern Practice of Physic,' 1805.\n'Conspectus of the London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Pharmacopœia,' 1810.\n'The New London Practice of Physic,' British Museum copy marked seventh edition, 1811 (a much enlarged edition of 2). In it he manifests very little knowledge of disease; he still advocates inoculation as the best remedy for small-pox, and mentions vaccination slightingly.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Bettany, George Thomas (1887). \"Clarke, Edward Goodman\".

Contested over 188 laps on the 2.66 mile (4.28 km) superspeedway, it will be the 10th race of the 2024 NASCAR Cup Series season.\n\n\n== Report ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nTalladega Superspeedway, formerly known as Alabama International Motor Speedway, is a motorsports complex located north of Talladega, Alabama. It is located on the former Anniston Air Force Base in the small city of Lincoln. A tri-oval, the track was constructed in 1969 by the International Speedway Corporation, a business controlled by the France family. Talladega is most known for its steep banking. The track currently hosts NASCAR's Cup Series, Xfinity Series and Craftsman Truck Series. Talladega is the longest NASCAR oval with a length of 2.66-mile-long (4.28 km) tri-oval like the Daytona International Speedway, which is 2.5-mile-long (4.0 km).\n\n\n==== Entry list ====\n(R) denotes rookie driver.\n(i) denotes driver who is ineligible for series driver points.\n\n\n== Qualifying ==\nMichael McDowell scored the pole for the race with a time of 52.609 and a speed of 182.022 mph (292.936 km/h).\nKyle Larson was on the pit-road to put down a qualifying lap but Nascar officals saw something with his car and pulled him to the garrage. He was not allowed to qualify as the team made an unapproved adjustment to the roof rails as they pushed the car to the grid.\n\n\n=== Qualifying results ===\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Television ===\nFox Sports will cover their 24th race at the Talladega Superspeedway. Mike Joy, Clint Bowyer and 2010 spring Talladega winner Kevin Harvick will call the race from the broadcast booth. Jamie Little, Regan Smith and Josh Sims will handle pit road for the television side, and Larry McReynolds will provide insight from the Fox Sports studio in Charlotte.\n\n\n=== Radio ===\nMRN will have the radio call for the race which will also be simulcasted on Sirius XM NASCAR Radio. Alex Hayden & Jeff Striegle will call the race in the booth when the field raced through the tri-oval. Dave Moody will call the race from the Sunoco spotters stand outside turn 2 when the field raced through turns 1 and 2. Mike Bagley will call the race from a platform inside the backstretch when the field raced down the backstretch & Dillon Welch will call the race from the Sunoco spotters stand outside turn 4 when the field raced through turns 3 and 4. Steve Post, Georgia Henneberry, Chris Wilner and Brienne Pedigo will work pit road for the radio side for MRN.\n\n\n== References ==",

He was a pastor and church planter at the non-denominational Nairobi Chapel until 2003, when he was ordained in the Anglican Church of Kenya. \nAfter his ordination, Maina was general secretary of Church Army Africa. In this capacity, he spoke to the New Zealand Church Missionary Society in 2006 and became aware of the challenges of work in a secular environment compared to the more religious culture of Kenya. He became more closely connected with New Zealand and in 2009 joined the NZCMS as national director and immigrated to New Zealand with his wife Watiri, an Anglican deacon, and their two young daughters. Since immigrating, the Mainas have become New Zealand citizens. \n\n\n== Episcopacy ==\nIn March 2019, Maina was elected the 11th bishop of Nelson, a historically evangelical diocese on the South Island. He was consecrated and installed on 31 August 2019 at Christ Church Cathedral. At the time of his election, he said that his \"heart has always been to see the church in New Zealand passionate about mission, so, this is really an extension of what I've been doing in CMS. . . . My reasons for considering the Nelson role were seeing, first of all, the challenges that Western Christianity is facing in the 21st century: challenges from secularism, individualism, materialism and consumerism; we have a society which is 'pushing God out.'\"\n\n\n== Views ==\nMaina describes himself as an evangelical and emphasizes his personal conversion and \"discover[y of] God's grace in Jesus.\" He also emphasizes the importance of biblical literacy and individual devotional practice. \nHe has also called on the church to serve as \"God's agent for social transformation\" in an environment where \"[i]n New Zealand, we look to government and community organisations to fix challenges around mental health and well-being. . . . It feels like we as church have checked out from our responsibility to bring social transformation.\"\nAt the time of his election, shortly after the General Synod of the Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia had voted to allow blessings of same-sex unions, Maina had not stated his position. He told media: \"I don't think it's right to make any comment on that just yet. I'm definitely conservative—I believe in the authority of the Bible and the power of the gospel to change lives—that does not mean that I don't appreciate the need to value and understand where other people are coming from.\" The synod of Diocese of Nelson's stated policy since 2004 has been that its ministers are prohibited from participating in or leading any service marriage (or a rite similar to it) for a same-sex couple. The diocese \"maintains the view that Scripture endorses marriage between a man and a woman as the only acceptable domain for sexual relationships, and therefore does not endorse sexual relationships between people of the same gender.\"\nIn September 2020, Maina joined a coalition of other Christian leaders calling on voters to vote no in the ultimately successful 2020 New Zealand euthanasia referendum.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nProfile on diocesan website",

Two weeks earlier, the French had driven the Spanish army from French territory in the Second Battle of Boulou.

        "content": "Antonio José Jiménez Puertas (Cartagena, Colombia, May 22, 1985) \nis a Colombian actor, physical trainer, and model, born and raised in a poor neighborhood of Cartagena, called Chapacuá.​ Toñito, as he is known in the neighborhood, is the youngest of four brothers. His mother Martha, a pensioner born in Cartagena, lives in this city, as well as his two sisters Karina and the eldest who is a nurse by profession. Jimenez and Jeymmy Paola Vargas, the actress and former beauty queen, have known each other and remained good friends since childhood.\nThe actor is a graduate from the Republic of Lebanon high school.\nAt the age of 15, he decided to move to Bogotá to fulfill his dream of being an actor. His sister, Martha Isabel, left Cartagena to accompany and support him.\nJiménez studied Criminal and Forensic Sciences, a career that he never pursued. Antonio says that he also began studying law, but abandon his studies to dedicate himself to acting.\nAlthough his work as a model gave him the opportunity to act in small roles in soap operas, such as Oye Bonita, where he played a police officer in one of the episodes, the opportunity to work professionally came in 2012 in the soap opera \"¿Donde carajos esta Umaña?\" (Where the hell is Umaña?). According to Jimenez, it was a small role, but it gave him the    opportunity to get the training and confidence to face the castings that came later. \nIn 2013 and 2014 he worked on the two seasons of the series 'La Selección'.\nIn December 2015, his sister, Martha Isabel, died due to a bacteria that affected her lungs. The actor then takes custody of her children, Marat, the youngest, and Brayan.  After completing the procedures at the Colombian Institute of Family Welfare, he managed to obtain the adoption of his two nephews.\nIn 2022 it was announced that the actor would be part of the cast of 'La Suprema'. Actors Elizabeth Martínez, Antonio Jiménez and Pabla Flórez lead the cast of this film,  a feature film inspired by the story of Antonio Cervantes, Kid Pambelé. Jiménez plays Efraín, the local coach and co-star in the movie that was filmed in the village of La Suprema (Marialabaja, Bolívar), winner of the best film at the Havana Film Festival, 2023 and chosen by the public as the best feature film in the Huelva Ibero-American Film Festival, Spain  and Colombia's entry in the 2023 Toronto International Film Festival, Discovery section.\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n=== Premios India Catalina ===\n\n\n=== Premios TV y novelas ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nAntonio Jimenez at IMDb",

        "content": "Funk Generation is the upcoming sixth studio album by Brazilian singer Anitta. It is scheduled to be released on April 26, 2024, through Republic Records and Universal Music Latin Entertainment. It is her third trilingual album after Kisses (2019) and Versions of Me (2022).\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter the release of her fifth studio album, Versions of Me, in April 2022 and the EP À Procura da Anitta Perfeita in November of the same year, Anitta confirmed that she was working on an entirely Brazilian funk album. At the end of January 2023, she was seen filming a series of music videos in Rio de Janeiro for the album. In April, she signed with Republic Records after ending her contract with Warner Records. She first teased the album title on June 9 with the creation of an Instagram broadcast channel called \"Funk Generation\". On June 22, she released the album's lead single, \"Funk Rave\". At the end of the month, Anitta revealed in an interview that the album would include collaborations with American singer Chlöe and English singer Sam Smith. On August 18, she released Funk Generation: A Favela Love Story as a preview of the album. The EP included the singles \"Funk Rave\", \"Casi Casi\" and \" Used to Be\". Although the singer initially stated that all three songs would appear on the album, only the first one was included in the final track listing.\nIn an interview for the Brazilian program De Frente com Blogueirinha, Anitta mentioned that the album would be released in early 2024, possibly in March. However, in late February 2024, she stated that the album's release was delayed because Sam Smith initially canceled the release of their collaboration. On March 21, Anitta announced the release date of the album and revealed that her collaboration with Smith would appear on the album; however, she mentioned that her collaboration with Chlöe might not appear on the album because it contains an uncleared sample of P. Diddy's \"I Need a Girl (Part Two)\" (2002).\n\n\n== Singles ==\n\"Funk Rave\" was released as the album's lead single on June 22, 2023. It reached number one in Colombia and Mexico, and number 47 in Brazil. The music video for the song was directed by João Wainer and Ricardo Souza and filmed in Rio de Janeiro. It features Anitta in a favela, where residents carry out activities such as playing football, dancing, and sunbathing. The song won Best Latin at the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\"Mil Veces\" was released as the album's second single on October 19, 2023. It reached number 21 in Portugal and number 22 in Brazil. The music video for the song was directed by Jackson Tisi and filmed in Canada. It features Anitta and Damiano David, the vocalist of the Italian band Måneskin, playing a couple in a \"tumultuous relationship\". A remix in Portuguese with Brazilian singer Melody was released on January 4, 2024.\n\"Joga pra Lua\" with Brazilian DJs Pedro Sampaio and Dennis was released as the album's third single on December 14, 2023. It reached number 17 in Brazil and number 48 in Portugal. The song was accompanied by a visualizer, which features the three artists on a beach at night.\n\"Double Team\" featuring Puerto Rican singer Brray and Spanish singer Bad Gyal was released as the album's fourth single on March 21, 2024. The music video for the song was directed by Sam Hayes. It features the three artists and a group of people at an outdoor party.\n\n\n== Baile Funk Experience ==\nOn April 8, 2024, Anitta announced the Baile Funk Experience tour in support of the album.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Treania Helen Lindsay Smith  (23 January 1901 – 21 September 1990), also known as Ena Smith but best known as Treania Smith, was an Australian art dealer, art gallery owner and artist.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nTreania Smith was born on 23 January 1901 in Clayfield, a suburb in Brisbane. Her parents, Margaret Mackenzie (née Lindsay) and architect Edwin Evan Smith, were both born in Scotland. Her father was president of the Queensland Art Society in the 1920s before moving to Melbourne where he was principal architect with the Victorian Public Works Department. Smith studied art with Max Meldrum and also attended Brisbane Central Technical College, where she was taught by Lewis Jarvis Harvey. She also studied sculpture at the Workingmen's College in Melbourne.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSmith exhibited a portrait of her father at the 1921 annual exhibition of the Queensland Art Society, a reviewer noting that she \"excels in portraiture and still life studies\". Her portraits were hung in the Archibald Prize in 1925, 1927 and 1932; her landscapes were exhibited in the Wynne Prize in 1932, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1938 and 1943.\nShe created a bust of Lady McPherson which was unveiled by the Duchess of York when she opened the Emily McPherson College of Domestic Economy in 1927.\nIn mid-1929 Smith left for London to further her studies in sculpture, returning in December the following year. While away, she was taught by sculptor Alexander Carrick and landscape artist William George Gillies at the Edinburgh College of Art.\nMoving to Sydney in the early 1930s, Smith was taught life modelling by Rayner Hoff at East Sydney Technical College. While there, she met Beryl Young. Young's father was one of the two founders of the Macquarie Galleries. Smith held her first solo exhibition in 1934 at the gallery and subsequently worked there for John Young.\nIn partnership with Lucy Swanton, Smith bought the Macquarie Galleries in 1938. When the partnership ended in 1956, Smith was joined by a series of co-directors, Mary Killen (1956–1976), Penny Meagher (1966–1972) and finally Eileen Chanin (1976–1979).\n\n\n== Recognition and legacy ==\nSmith was awarded the British Empire Medal (BEM) in the 1979 Queen's Birthday Honours for her service to the arts. \nSmith was interviewed on her contribution to the Australian art scene by Hazel de Berg in 1965 for the National Library of Australia and by James Gleeson in 1979 for National Gallery of Australia.\nA portrait of Smith by Ena Joyce was a finalist in the 1951 Archibald Prize. Well-known artists, Thea Proctor and Judy Cassab, also painted her likeness.\n\n\n== Personal ==\nSmith married long-time friend Clive Edwin Bennett in 1962. In 1979 the couple moved to Whale Beach. She died at Bayview on 21 September 1990. Her husband predeceased her.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPortrait of Treania Smith (1930s–1940s) by Thea Proctor\nPortrait of Treania Smith (1957) by Judy Cassab",

        "content": "Félix Nlandu Wazekwa (born 14 September 1962), known professionally as Félix Wazekwa, is a Congolese singer-songwriter, author, filmmaker, dancer, and bandleader. Known for his Lingala deep lyrics and baritone voice, he is regarded as an influential figure in soukous and Congolese rumba music and one of the most prominent lyricists of his generation.\nWazekwa began his music career as a member of the Kinshasa-based group Kin-Verso. In 1995, he released his debut solo studio album, Tétragramme, which featured Papa Wemba and Madilu System. In 1997, Wazekwa released his second studio album titled Pauvres, Mais. His third studio album, Bonjour Monsieur, released on 10 November 1998, became a significant success throughout Africa, earning him the Revelation accolade of that year. In 1999, he formed his backing band, Cultur'A Pays Vie, and then released his fourth studio album, Sponsor, followed by Signature (2001) and Yo Nani? (2002). On 25 August 2004, Wazekwa released his seventh studio album, Et Après..., succeeded by Faux Mutu Moko Boye in 2005. In 2007, he released his ninth studio album, Que Demande Le Peuple?, followed by Mémoire ya Nzambe in 2010. He returned with Adamu na Eva in 2013, and I Love You in January 2015 before releasing his first book.\nWazekwa gained widespread recognition with his breakout ndombolo-infused single, \"Fimbu,\" which debuted in September 2015 in support of the Congolese national football team, nicknamed Les Léopards. The song gained significant popularity during the run-up to the 2016 African Nations Championship and went on to become a sleeper hit in 2017. The accompanying \"Fimbu chicotte\" dance move expeditiously gained momentum during the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations tournament, involving players raising their left arm while waving their right as they moved in unison down the pitch. \nHis book Les Petits Bonbons de la Sagesse was published by Bergame on 10 January 2018. Wazekwa released his thirteenth studio album, Article 23, in 2020.\n\n\n== Early life and musical career ==\n\n\n=== 1962–1995: Childhood, education and music debut ===\nFélix Wazekwa was born as Félix Nlandu Wazekwa on 14 September 1962 in Léopoldville (now Kinshasa), in what was then the Belgian Congo (and was later the Republic of the Congo, then Zaire, and is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Wazekwa was drawn to music at a young age and formed a troupe of local children in the 1970s. During this time, Wazekwa gained recognition for his prowess in dancing. He subsequently founded a traditional music ensemble known as \"SODEPA\" in the Kinshasa's Matete commune, where he became celebrated for his singing and dancing abilities. Between 1982 and 1983, he formed another musical collective named Kin-Verso in the Matete commune.\nAfter graduating from high school with a French baccalaureate from the Académie des Beaux-Arts in Kinshasa, Wazekwa pursued economics studies at Paris 8 University Vincennes-Saint-Denis in 1985. Thereafter, he became an autodidact and augmented his knowledge through reading, which gave him an interest in literary polymaths like Henry Nelson and Paul Valéry, alongside contemporary writers like Jean d'Ormesson and Michel Serres. After completing his studies, he returned to Kinshasa and began working as a songwriter for various up-and-coming Zairean artists. He swiftly garnered attention from Koffi Olomidé, who incorporated Wazekwa's compositions into his projects between 1991 and 1993, notably featured in albums such as Haut De Gamme - Koweit, Rive Gauche, and Noblesse Oblige.\nAfter a brief stint with Koffi Olomide, Papa Wemba approached Wazekwa to assist him in refining his songwriting abilities. In 1994, Wazekwa contributed four tracks to Papa Wemba's band Viva La Musica's album Foridoles, with the track \"Reference,\" composed by Wazekwa, gaining prominence as the album's standout piece. Wazekwa also claimed authorship of the song \"Nzete Ya Séquoia.\" Following this, he participated in Papa Wemba's 1995 release, Pôle Position.\n\n\n== Solo career ==\n\n\n=== 1995–1997: Tétragramme and Pauvres, Mais… ===\nWhile simultaneously involved in the production of Papa Wemba's album Pôle Position, Wazekwa was encouraged by Papa Wemba to pursue a solo musical career. During an interview with Ba Sango Ya Congo Kinshasa, Wazekwa expressed, \"It was Papa Wemba who urged me to take the stage... you can keep giving me songs, but you can also sing.\" In that same year, Wazekwa commenced the recording of his debut studio album, Tétragramme, with the backing and support of Papa Wemba and Madilu System. Tétragramme blended Congolese rumba with soukous. The album also included collaborations with Tabu Ley Rochereau, Bozi Boziana, and Déesse Mukangi. Tétragramme received widespread critical acclaim, and Wazekwa was honored as the Best Revelation of the Year by ACMCO.\nIn 1997, Wazekwa released his second studio album, titled Pauvres, Mais… (Poor, but...), which received widespread praise throughout the country for its lyrical content. The album's songs explored themes of love and socioeconomic commentary. The track \"Biléi Ya Mobóla\" metaphorically addresses the concept of love while drawing attention to the struggles of underprivileged people who are left with nothing but bones to eat. Meanwhile, the album's eponymous single serves as a critique against those who scorn the economically marginalized.\n\n\n=== 1998–2004: Bonjour Monsieur, Sponsor, Signature, Yo Nani?, and Et Après... ===\nBonjour Monsieur, Wazekwa's third studio album, debuted on 10 November 1998, propelled Wazekwa into the spotlight and received accolades across Africa.\nIn 1999, he founded his own band Cultur'A Pays-Vie, which altered plans for his forthcoming 10-track album, Sponsor. The album was recorded in Kinshasa at Meko Studio and in Paris at the Marcadet studio. Sponsor was released later that year in December 1999 and was produced by Cameroonian record label JPS Production.\nIn June 2001, he released his fifth studio album, Signature. The album was again recorded in Paris at the Marcadet studio, featuring 12 tracks and distributed by JPS Production. Wazekwa subsequently won two consecutive CHADA awards for Best Artist of the Year and Best Orchestra of the Year for his ensemble. He also won three ACMCO awards for Best Composer, Best Artist, and Best Orchestra for his ensemble.\nOn 12 November 2002, Wazekwa published his introspective sixth studio album, Yo Nani? (which translates to \"Who are you?\"). Throughout 11 tracks, Wazekwa explored existential inquiries concerning human worth and societal structure, urging both himself and audience to contemplate: Who Are You? Who Are We? as a means to establish any semblance of superiority over others.\nIn 2004, Wazekwa released his seventh studio album, Et Après..., which was produced across Africa and Europe.  The album experienced significant success, particularly with the hit dance track \"Nzoto Ya Maman Elengi,\" which received widespread acclaim from audiences and led to his nomination for Best Artist in Central Africa at the 2004 Kora Awards held in South Africa.\n\n\n=== 2005–2010: Faux Mutu Moko Boye, Mosapi Liboso, Que Demande Le Peuple?, and Mémoire ya Nzambe ===\nIn December 2005, he released his eighth studio album, Faux Mutu Moko Boye, sometimes abbreviated FMMB. The album was a great success and was greatly admired by the Kinshasa public.\nTowards the end of 2006, Wazekwa issued a six-track maxi-single titled Mosapi Liboso on behalf of his sponsor. However, in 2007, his band experienced the consecutive departures of several key members who joined the Quartier Latin International orchestra led by Wazekwa's former collaborator and rival, Koffi Olomidé. In early 2008, Wazekwa recruited new backing vocalists and unveiled his ninth studio album, Que Demande Le Peuple?, marking the group's debut album. He presented a major concert at the Olympia Hall in Paris and another at the Zénith de Lille.\nIn 2009, Wazekwa released his tenth studio album, Mémoire ya Nzambe, which includes 13 tracks and features a guest appearance by Simaro Lutumba on its eponymous track. The album subtly taunts his former musicians who left Cultur'A Pays-Vie.\n\n\n=== 2011–2019: Haut Les Mains!, Adamu Na Eva, I Love You, and \"Fimbu\" ===\nIn 2011, Wazekwa released his 10-track maxi-single titled Haut Les Mains! on compact disc and Digital Video Disc. However, the maxi-single was pirated following its debut and was broadcast clandestinely in front of everyone at one of Kinshasa's primary venues, Place de la Victoire, with no repercussions. \nIn May 2012, during an interview with Radio Okapi, Wazekwa announced his forthcoming eleventh studio album, Adamu Na Eva (Adam and Eve). He told Radio Okapi that the choice of the album's title is a desire to affirm the uniqueness of the human race despite variances in complexion, ethnicity, and dialect. He also revealed that he was working on the record with fellow Congolese rhythm guitarist, Simaro Lutumba. In July 2013, Wazekwa announced that the album was in the conclusive phases of production, having concluded filming for its music videos, and awaited collaboration with reputable distribution entities in Kinshasa and abroad to avoid falling into the hands of corrupt producers. While awaiting the ideal distribution partner, Wazekwa and his ensemble continued rehearsals in the Ngiri-Ngiri commune of Kinshasa. Adamu Na Eva was officially published on 19 September 2013, containing ten tracks, and enjoyed considerable success. He later supported the album with a live show alongside his ensemble at the Pullman Kinshasa Grand Hôtel on 30 November, followed by a concert in Kongo Central Province on December 21 at the Ledya Hotel in Matadi. He later performed in Brazzaville with his ensemble at the Ledger Plaza Maya Maya hotel. He returned to Kinshasa again and performed at the Venus Hotel in the Gombe commune.\nWazekwa began recording his 13-track twelfth studio album, I Love You, in early 2014 in Kinshasa. During this time, he performed at the Marché de la Liberté in Kinshasa on 13 June 2014 and at the Bralima-sponsored Primus Fete de la Musique at the Theatre de Verdure in the Ngaliema commune. On 20 December, he released the album's lead single \"Bouffez-Moi Tout Ça\" in the Paris market. I Love You was officially released on 3 January 2015. He subsequently presented the album with a performance at the Foire Internationale de Kinshasa on 4 January.\nOn 5 September 2015, Wazekwa released his ndombolo-infused single \"Fimbu,\" aimed at combatting impunity and violence against women, while rallying support for the Congolese national football team, nicknamed Les Léopards. The song quickly garnered significant success in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Republic of the Congo, and Angola. He was subsequently invited to perform at Cinema Atlântico in Luanda, Angola, on 10 October of that year. The accompanying \"Fimbu Chicotte\" dance move gained widespread popularity in Africa during the lead-up to the 2016 African Nations Championship and went on to become a sleeper hit in 2017 during the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations, emerging as a celebratory dance for Les Léopards to celebrate every goal they scored on the pitch, with players gathering side by side, holding their left arm up and waving their right as they moved down the pitch in unison. The dance propelled Wazekwa into the limelight across Africa and Europe, particularly in Belgium and France.\n\n\n=== 2020 — present: Article 23 ===\nIn 2020, Wazekwa released his thirteenth studio double album titled Article 23, which included guest appearances by Barbara Kanam and Héritier Watanabe. The double album contained 24 tracks and was released by his record label Foundation Wazekwa.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nTétragramme, YHWH (1995)\nPauvres, Mais… (1997)\nBonjour Monsieur (1998)\nSponsor (1999)\nSignature (2001)\nYo Nani ?

        "content": "Martha Himmelfarb (born 1952) is an American scholar of religion.  Her areas of focus include the Second Temple period in Jewish history, Jewish and Christian apocalyptic literature, Hekhalot literature, early Christianity, early rabbinic Judaism after the fall of the Second Temple, and the Jewish priesthood.  She became an academic at Princeton University in New Jersey in 1978, and eventually acquired the named chair of William H. Danforth Professor of Religion.  She took on emeritus status at Princeton in 2022.  Much of Himmelfarb's work is on the intersection of Hellenistic Judaism, Jewish Christianity, and early Christianity in general; she considers older approaches to have overly downplayed early Christianity's Jewish roots and Jewish influences, and advocates that the wider split between Judaism and Christianity occurred more slowly and gradually than traditional views portrayed it.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMartha Himmelfarb was born in 1952 in New York City to the Himmelfarb family, who descended from Russian Jews who emigrated to America.  Her father was the sociographer Milton Himmelfarb who worked as director of research at the American Jewish Committee; and her aunt was Gertrude Himmelfarb, also known as Bea Kristol.  Her family was not particularly observant to Jewish law, but took seriously Jewish life and culture.  She attended White Plains High School, then attended Barnard College for her undergraduate education.  She also studied at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America from 1970–1974 and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1972–1973.  She received a bachelor's degree majoring in the Greek language from Barnard in 1974, with distinction.  In her studies, she also learned  Aramaic and Classical Hebrew.  She received a PhD from the University of Pennsylvania in 1981, studying under Bob Kraft.  Her dissertation on Jewish origins of Christian apocalyptic literature such as the Apocalypse of Peter and the Apocalypse of Paul would be the foundation of her first scholarly book, Tours of Hell: An Apocalyptic Form in Jewish and Christian Literature, a well-received and influential work published in 1983.\nHimmelfarb joined the religion department at Princeton University in 1978, initially as a lecturer; gained a position as assistant professor after completing her PhD in 1981; and was promoted to full professor in 1994.  In 1995, Ronald O. Perelman made a major donation to Princeton to establish a school of Judaic Studies, and Himmelfarb was a key player in establishing the academic background of what would become the Princeton program in Jewish studies from its beginnings in 1982 to becoming a full certificate program in 1995.  She served as department chair of the Religion Department from 1999 to 2006, and gained the named chair of William H. Danforth Professor of Religion.  She was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2008.  She then served as director of Judaic Studies in 2013–2020.  She took emeritus status at Princeton in Spring 2022; in her final year she was awarded the Howard T. Behrman Award for Distinguished Achievement in the Humanities, an award given to Princeton faculty.\nIn 2023, the book Above, Below, Before, and After: Studies in Judaism and Christianity in Conversation with Martha Himmelfarb was published, a festschrift with articles related to Himmelfarb's research and in dialogue with her work.\nIn Himmelfarb's personal life, she is married to Steven Weiss, a sculptor and draftsman who worked at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.  The couple has four children together.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\nBooks\n\nHimmelfarb, Martha (1983). Tours of Hell: An Apocalyptic Form in Jewish and Christian Literature.

It was first scientifically described as a new species in 1821 by the German lichenologist Heinrich Gustav Flörke, in his work Deutsche Lichenen (\"German Lichens\"). It maintains its original name after two centuries of taxonomic history. The lichen has a circumpolar distribution, typically in coniferous forests but extending north to tundra in North America. It is widely distributed in the boreal forest region of North America, and also occurs in Europe, New Zealand, the West Indies, and Hawaii.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "As a Manchu-led imperial dynasty of China and the last imperial dynasty in Chinese history, the legacy of the Qing dynasty has been significant and enduring. It is generally agreed that the Qing dynasty had major impact in China, laying the foundation for the modern Chinese state as a geographic and ethnic entity. Additionally, it had varying degrees of influence in surrounding countries (such as Russia and Mongolia) and other parts of the world.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe Qing dynasty (1644-1912) was the largest political entity ever to center itself on China as known today. Succeeding the Ming dynasty, the Qing dynasty more than doubled the geographical extent of the Ming dynasty, which it displayed in 1644, and also tripled the Ming population, reaching a size of about half a billion people in its last years. The vast majority of its large territory, together with its immense and expanding population as well as the associated problems, would be bequeathed to its successor states, the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China. For the Qing was many things, but the closing chapter of the 2000-year history of imperial China was one of them.\nDuring the Ming dynasty the name \"China\" (中華; 中國) was generally understood to refer to the political realm of the Han Chinese, and this understanding persisted among the Han Chinese into the early Qing dynasty, and the understanding was also shared by Aisin Gioro rulers before the Ming-Qing transition. The Qing dynasty, however, \"came to refer to their more expansive empire not only as the Great Qing but also, nearly interchangeably, as China\" within a few decades of this development. Instead of the earlier (Ming) idea of an ethnic Han Chinese state, this new Qing China was a \"self-consciously multi-ethnic state\". Han Chinese scholars had some time to adapt this, but by the 19th century, the notion of China as a multinational state with new, significantly extended borders had become the standard terminology for Han Chinese writers. William T. Rowe noted that \"these were the origins of the China we know today\".\nThe immediate roots of the modern political term Zhonghua minzu (lit. 'Chinese nation') also lie in the Qing dynasty founded by the Manchus. While the dynasty assembled the territorial base for modern China, the 1727 Treaty of Kyakhta established the northern border of Mongolia (what was then part of the Qing-Russian border). Although the dynasty reached its peak during the High Qing era, it later ceded regions like Outer Manchuria (to Russia) and Taiwan (to Japan) following the Opium Wars and the First Sino-Japanese War. With the outbreak of the 1911 Revolution and the fall of the Qing dynasty, the Republic of China promoted the Five Races Under One Union principle, but the Mongols in Outer Mongolia declared their independence and established the Bogd Khanate of Mongolia in December 1911. Actual independence from the Republic of China was also achieved in 1921, and Mongolia (as a satellite state of the Soviet Union) joined the United Nations in 1961. Otherwise China kept its territory basically intact as the Qing dynasty was transformed into a modern Chinese nation state.\n\n\n== Historiography ==\nThe Confucian concept of the dynastic cycle was used by traditional Chinese historiography to organize China's past in terms of consecutive ruling houses that arose and collapsed. However, by the second half of the 20th century, Confucian historiography had lost favor at least in the west. Rather, John King Fairbank of Harvard University, a historian who is essentially credited with founding modern Chinese history in the United States, steadfastly maintained a perspective that split the history of China's past half millennium around 1842. All that fell before remained part of \"traditional China\", and with the Western \"shock\" of the First Opium War and the resulting Treaty of Nanking, \"modern China\" was born. In contemporary China there is also a similar view for such a division.\nA popular position among many Chinese writers and scholars since the fall of the Qing has been that its rulers and administrators were largely to blame for China's weakness during the century of humiliation. However, other scholars have emphasized various positive aspects of the Qing dynasty, such as the economy prior to the Opium Wars, and a more favorable view has also emerged in popular culture. In the 21st century, scholars like American historian Peter C. Perdue has characterized the Qing as a colonial empire in the same league as the great powers of New Imperialism, in reaction to a traditionalist and nationalist views that reject the comparison of the imperial Chinese system with European-style colonialism. Instead, nationalists have often portrayed imperial China (also known as the Celestial Empire) as more or less benevolent, as well as stronger and more advanced than the West. Although officially anti-imperialist and anti-feudalism, China's present leaders have often played on this popular sentiment to proclaim that their current policies serve to restore China's historical glory.\nThe New Qing History is a revisionist historiographical school that emerged during in the mid-1990s that emphasizes the particular Manchu character of the dynasty. Earlier historians had emphasized a pattern of Han sinicization of various conquerors. In the 1980s and early 1990s, American scholars began learning the Manchu language, taking advantage of archival holdings in this and other non-Chinese languages that had long been held in Taipei and Beijing but had previously attracted little scholarly attention. In addition, a revitalized interest in the study of ethnicity led to new understanding of non-Han peoples within Chinese politics and society, also forming part of a broader rethinking of how the Chinese nation-state developed. This research concluded that the Manchu rulers 'manipulated' their subjects through fostering a sense of Manchu identity, often adopting Central Asian models of rule as much as Confucian ones. The most critical academic interest of New Qing historians has been to discover the Inner Asian dimension of Qing rule, to better incorporate the use of non-Han historical evidence, especially Manchu-language documents, and to pay additional attention to the greater trends in global history. Some argue that the Manchu rulers regarded Han China as merely a core part of a much wider empire that extended into Mongolia, Tibet, Manchuria and Xinjiang. However, Mark Elliott, a prominent New Qing scholar, emphasizes he views the popular retort that New Qing History unduly separates the dynasty from China as a misunderstanding. Instead, it simply raises questions about the relationship between the two—with the concept of 'China' being fluid and multifaceted over time, not fixed; the school hopes to understand how the concept of 'China' evolved during the Qing dynasty, and does not attempt to argue that the Qing dynasty was not Chinese.\nPing-ti Ho criticized this new approach for a perceived exaggeration of the dynasty's Manchu character, hewing towards the traditional position of sinicization, while scholars like Zhao Gang and Zhong Han have argued from the evidence that the Qing dynasty self-identified as China. Some Chinese scholars have accused the American group of scholars of projecting particular American conceptions of race and identity onto China in an unjustified manner. Others within China instead support these perspectives, seeing the scholarship as opening new vistas within the study of Qing history. Inspired by New Qing History studies, the so-called \"New Ming History\" has emerged, which similarly attempts to draw attention to the Inner Asian characteristics of the preceding Ming dynasty.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of the Qing dynasty\nNames of the Qing dynasty\nQing dynasty in Inner Asia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n—— (2009).

        "content": "62nd Infantry Regiment was Philippine Army Reserve unit activated in November 1941 in Panay Island. It was organized from the Army reservist in that area with officers mostly coming from Luzon and Americans. I was based and trained in Cabatuan, Iloilo and was placed as part of 61st Infantry Division activated on November 1, 1941, in preparation for Japanese invasion of the Philippines.\nThe regiment was transferred and fought in Cagayan sector in Mindanao island until its surrender on May 12, 1942. It was commanded by US Army officer Lieutenant Colonel Allen Thayer.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe regiment was activated on August 28, 1941, and inducted to USAFFE on September 1, 1941, in Camp Delgado, Iloilo. Lieutenant Colonel Allen Thayer arrived in Panay island along with other commanders in late November 1941 just days before the hostilities started. The regiment has the same problem with other units with old M1917 Rifles with broken extractors, lack of ammunition that soldiers are not allowed to fire their weapons during training to conserve ammunition, lack of training, and communication equipment.\n\n\n=== Leadership and Staffs ===\nLieutenant Colonel Allen Thayer a WestPoint graduate in 1928 became commanding officer of the regiment in November 1941.\nCaptain Reed L. McCartney, CO 1st Battalion, Captain Harry J. Skinner, CO 2nd Battalion\n\n\n=== Transfer to Mindanao ===\n\nOn January 3, 1942, the regiment received an order that came from Visayas-Mindanao Force Headquarters from Cebu to transfer to Mindanao. Along with 61st Infantry Regiment and 61st Field Artillery Regiment they took inter-island ferry to Pulupandan, Negros Occidental and took motor transports to down to southern port of Dumaguete, Negros Oriental. The transfer was made in secrecy that Colonel Thayer only knew his destination upon loading of the regiment to a boat. The regiment landed the following day in Iligan in Lanao province. Initially they were attached to Brigadier General Guy Fort's 81st Infantry Division and was assigned on Iligan area to defend.\n\n\n=== Transfer to Cagayan Sector ===\nIn February 1942, orders came from General Sharp for the regiment to transfer to Cagayan sector. The regiment was on half ration ever since due to food supply was missing when the cross to Negros island. From Lanao they marched through trail until they reached Lake Pinamaloy in Bukidnon. After few days rest they were moved to Cagayan Sector to defend west of Macajalar bay along Cugman River. In March 1942 after General MacArthur's stopover in Mindanao a new division was organized to command all forces in the Cagayan sector as part of a reorganization of USAFFE.\n\n\n=== Japanese landing in Macajalar Bay ===\nOn April 28, 1942, Kawamura detachment landed in two locations of Macajalar Bay. Tagoloan which was attacked by 103rd Infantry Regiment under Major Webb and in Cagayan River which 62nd Infantry assigned to defend it. Colonel Thayer's men was not able to stop the Japanese landing in their area and after few hours they were forced to withdraw towards Puerto and Tankulan to cover the retreat of 61st Field Artillery and 103rd Infantry and setup the new line of defense in Bukidnon.\n\n\n== First Battle of Mangima Canyon ==\nOn orders from General Sharp 62nd, 93rd Infantry Regiment, and Artillery Detachment established their new line of defense along Mangima Canyon, a natural barrier that Sayre Highway to the south and then east. Japanese moved forward towards Sayre Highway with armored vehicles, artillery fire support, and air support overcame the defenders in Mangima. 62nd along with 93rd Infantry Regiment under Major Goldtrap and Major Philips Artillery detachment was again in retreat in fear of being cutoff. Sector and 102nd Division commander Colonel Morse ordered Thayer to setup defensive position farther south in Dalirig.\n\n\n=== Surrender ===\nOn May 10, 1942, an order from sector and division commander Colonel William P. Morse received by Lieutenant Colonel Thayer to surrender his regiment at daybreak the following day. 62nd Infantry was in Somilao sector when it surrendered to the Japanese. Three American officers, seven Filipino officers, and 166 Filipino enlisted men from the 62nd Infantry surrendered.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== See also ===\nVisayas-Mindanao Force\nMindanao Force\n61st Infantry Division\n81st Infantry Division\n102nd Infantry Division\n\n\n=== External links ===\nThere were others, Unpublished papers of Colonel Hiram Tarkington, CO 61st Field Artillery Regiment.\nTwo Battles for Purple Heart Canyon, Battles of Mangima Canyon 1942 & 1945",

        "content": "TT217, or Tomb of Ipuy, is the tomb of the ancient Egyptian artisan Ipuy and members of his family in Deir el-Medina, near modern Luxor, Egypt. Ipuy (also transcribed as Apy) was a sculptor active in the reign of Ramesses II of the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt.\nTT217 is situated on the upper terrace in the western cemetery of the ancient workmen's village of Deir el-Medina. The complex consists of a chapel within a walled courtyard and at least 10 subterranean rooms. The chapel's decoration depicts craftsmen at work in addition to daily life scenes.\nThe tomb was first published by Jean-Vincent Scheil in 1894 but its location was later lost. The tomb was rediscovered by Arthur Weigall in his 1911-12 excavation season and subsequently excavated by the Metropolitan Museum in 1912 and 1920, and by Bernard Bruyère in the mid-1920s. Since 2020 Kathrin Gabler has carried out further investigation and documentation of the tomb.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Works cited ===\nGabler, Kathrin (2022). \"TT 217: La Tombe d'Ipouy (i) (Deir el-Médina (2021): Mission d'étude et de restauration)\".

        "content": "Luis Colina Álvarez (12 August 1888 – 22 July 1956) was a Spanish football referee and a one-match manager of the Spanish national team. He was also briefly at the helm of the Real Madrid CF team during the 1919–20 season and was the third president of the National Committee of Referees from 1924 to 1926.\n\n\n== Sporting career ==\n\n\n=== Athletic career ===\nColina began his career as an active athlete in athletics, a discipline in which he excelled as a distance runner and pole vaulter. He trained for his athletic exercises in the famous gym of the Sociedad Gimnástica, a multi-sport club that also had a football department, the sport to which he would end up dedicating his entire life.In 1909, his military service took him to Badajoz, where in 1910 he enlisted in the ranks of the Sport Club of that city. After returning to the capital in 1911, he founded the Stadium de Pardiñas in the Madrid neighborhood where he was born, a club where he served first as a player and then as president. According to posting practice, he also performed regular coastal judge service.\n\n\n=== National refereeing ===\nIn the Gimnástica football team, Colina played alongside the likes of Sócrates Quintana and José Manuel Kindelán, with the latter going on to found the College of Referees of the Center on 15 April 1914, the very first College of Referees. Shortly after hanging up his boots in the mid-1910s, he decided to become a referee. After passing his game management exam in Madrid in 1914, he received his qualification as a referee from the newly established Central College of Referees in Madrid.Colina began his refereeing career in the regional championships of Madrid, which was organized by the Madrid Football Federation (FFM). At the suggestion of the FFM, the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) employed him as a national referee in 1923. As such, in the 1923–24 season, Colina refereed one knockout match in the Prince of Asturias Cup, a quarterfinal between Valencia and Andalusia that ended in a 3–2 victory to the latter; and then another one in the Copa del Rey, the tie break of a quarterfinal clash between FC Barcelona and Sporting de Gijón, which ended in a 3–1 victory to the former. In the week leading up to the 1923 Copa del Rey final between Athletic Bilbao and CE Europa, several doubts arose about the referee since the first option was a Basque, so Julián Ruete proposed Colina of the College of Referees of the Center as a substitute, but in the end, Colina served as a line judge alongside Emilio Sampere.His most important achievement as a referee was founding the National Association of Referees in 1922. Colina was the general secretary of the National Committee of Referees before replacing Carlos Dieste as the new president of the committee, a position that he held for two years until 1926, when he was replaced by Antonio de Cárcer. He retired from national refereeing in 1927, two years before the first national championship in 1929. In total, he oversaw 36 national matches: (1924–25).\n\n\n=== International refereeing ===\nThe RFEF presented Colina as an international referee on the recommendation of the National Committee of Referees, and the International Football Federation (FIFA) registered him as a referee in 1924. In total, he only oversaw two international meetings, the first of which at the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris. He was sent there alongside a younger partner, and due to the expectations of the age, Colina being already 35, his partner was named the number one referee. If he was not officiating, he was helping his partner, and in fact, in a second-round match between France and Latvia, Colina served as a linesman. Colina then refereed a round of 16 match between Egypt and Hungary at the Stade de Paris, which ended in a 3–0 victory to the former. In doing so, Colina became the first Spaniard to act as main referee in an international match.Colina then had to wait nearly three years for his next and last international experience, a friendly match between Portugal and France in Lisbon, which ended in a 4–0 victory to the former. After this performance, he decided to end his refereeing career.\n\n\n=== Managerial career ===\nOn 21 December 1924, together with José Rosich and Julián Olave, he co-managed the Spanish national team in a friendly match at home against Austria, which ended in a 2–1 victory thanks to goals from Antonio Juantegui and Josep Samitier.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nShortly after abandoning his activity as a referee in 1927, Colina was hired by Facundo Pascual Quilis, the president of Valencia CF as general and technical secretary, a position in which he remained for 28 years, until shortly before his death. His experience was fundamental in the team's development, being present in the great historical events of the entity, such as promotion to the First Division in 1932 and runner-up in the Copa del Rey in 1934.When the Spanish Civil War broke out, Colina was part of the club's board of directors, maintaining a predominantly sports line, above the harsh political events. Thus, in 1939, when football recomposed his order, he became a fundamental character in organizing one of the most brilliant stages in the history of Valencia. He created, from his position as technical secretary, the basis of a team that won the League three times: 1941–42, 1943–44 and 1946–47; They were runners-up three times: 1947–48, 1948–49, 1952–53; three-time champions of the Generalísimo Cup: 1941, 1949 and 1954, and four-time finalists: 1944, 1945, 1946 and 1952. Valencia also won the Copa Eva Duarte in 1949, after having been a finalist in 1948.Upon his retirement, on 3 January 1954, Valencia paid him a tribute match against Rapid Vienna, in gratitude for his twenty-six continued years of dedication to the club.\n\n\n== Death ==\nColina died in Valencia on 22 July 1956, at the age of 67.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The National Committee of Referees (Spanish: Comité National de Árbitros), also known as Technical Committee of Referees, directly attends to the functioning of the federative collective of referees and is responsible, under subordination to the president of the RFEF, for the government, representation, and administration of the functions attributed to them. It is in charge of the operation and organization of the Spanish arbitration world. Of course, it is the body in charge of appointing matches or promotions of referees, assistant referees, match delegates, and football and futsal reporters in national categories. Likewise, it is the body in charge of communicating to FIFA the selection of international referees and assistants each season.\n\n\n== History ==\nThis federative technical body in charge of the arbitration field has had different names throughout its almost 100 years of existence. At the first start of football in Spain, the refereeing aspect was regulated by the different regional federations that, under subjective criteria, appointed the referees and maintained the refereeing organization. At first, the matches were refereed by managers or players from the competing clubs. Later it passed to the regional federations, and in the 1920s a federative body was definitively created to unify criteria at the Spanish state level.\n\n\n=== Denominations ===\nThere have been three names by which the highest refereeing body in Spanish football has been known. From its beginnings until the end of the Spanish Civil War, it was called the National Committee of Referees (CNA). After the war, it changed to a name that well-defined the verticality of the regime, the Central Committee of Referees (CCA). In the 1960s the name of the National Committee of Referees (CNA) was recovered, and in 1993 after the arrival of Sánchez Arminio to the presidency, the body was named the Technical Committee of Referees (CTA), a name that remains to this day.\nDenominations:\n\nNational Committee of Referees (CNA)\nCentral Committee of Referees (CCA)\nNational Committee of Referees (CNA)\nTechnical Committee of Referees (CTA)\n\n\n== Features ==\nThe Technical Committee of Referees is regulated in the Statutes of the RFEF in Title VI (Of the bodies of the RFEF), Chapter 4 (Of the technical bodies), in its Section 1 (Of the Technical Committee of Referees). Subsequently, this body is developed more deeply in the General Regulations of the RFEF.\nIt is responsible for the operation, organization or designation of soccer and futsal referees in national categories. In football, this would mean that the CTA is in charge of everything related to referees, except for their assignment in professional leagues (Primera, Segunda, and Segunda B), which, as stated in point 5 of the RFEF Statutes, Arbitration appointments are made by a Committee in charge of the league and the RFEF. The Tercera División, despite being a category initially recognized as national, is a mixed category, in which most of the regulation is transferred to the autonomous federations, so the same thing happens arbitrarily and its regulation, except for some issues, It remains under autonomous organization.\nThese provisions of the RFEF Statutes were subsequently developed in the General Regulations of the RFEF, such as designations, members and their actions, the National School of Football Referees (ENAF), and Et cetera.\n\n\n=== Autonomous committees ===\nAnother function of the CTA is that of the regulatory and supervisory body of the technical arbitration committees of the different autonomous federations. The different regional technical committees that are dependent on their respective federations and the CTA itself are listed below:\n\nNotas:",

        "content": "Following the results of the 2024 Tasmanian state election, which resulted in a hung parliament with the Liberal Party winning the most seats, the incumbent Liberal government, led by Premier Jeremy Rockliff, will negotiate with independents and the Jacqui Lambie Network (JLN) to seek confidence and supply to form a minority government for the party's fourth consecutive term in office.\nThe Labor opposition, led by Opposition Leader Rebecca White, will not form government. White conceded defeat the day after the election, stating that Labor could not realistically form a government, even with the support of the Greens, led by Rosalie Woodruff. White also resigned as Labor leader after leading the party to defeat for a third time under her leadership. She was succeeded by Franklin MP Dean Winter, who was elected unopposed to the position. \n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe 2024 state election delivered a hung parliament, with no party winning a majority of seats. 18 seats are required for a majority in the 35-seat House of Assembly.\n\n\n== Potential alliances ==\nBefore White conceded defeat, many proposals had been considered possible. One potential alliance was the \"traffic light alliance\" or the \"traffic light coalition\", which was a hypothetical alliance or coalition between Labor, the Greens and the JLN. The hypothetical alliance or coalition's name is derived from the colours of the three parties, which are the colours used on traffic lights: red (Labor), yellow (JLN) and green (Greens).\n\n\n== Rockliff government formation ==\nDue to Labor having conceded, the Rockliff Liberal government will continue governing Tasmania for another four-year-term, with Rockliff remaining Premier. Tasmania is currently the only state with a Liberal premier. Rockliff ruled out working with the Greens, and ruled out forming a coalition government as that would require some crossbenchers to be given cabinet portfolios. He also stated that he will not compromise on his 2030 Strong Plan policy. On 10 April 2024, the three elected Jacqui Lambie Network MPs announced they had reached a deal to support the Rockliff Government on matters of confidence and supply for an initial 12 month period.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Daniel Musser (1809–1877) was a physician and a bishop  at the Longenecker's Reformed Mennonite Church in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, USA. He is best known for his 1864 book \"Non-Resistance Asserted\" \n, from which Leo Tolstoy quoted extensively in his 1894 book \"The Kingdom of God is Within You\".\nMusser belonged to the Reformed Mennonites, one of the smallest and strictest Mennonite groups, formed in 1812 and which, by 1906, had 2,079 members in 34 congregations, mainly in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Ontario. The Church adopted the sixteenth century Anabaptist practice of  banning and shunning to reform members.\nMusser was unusual in being a physician in a community largely dominated by farmers and artisans. As a writer, he wrote with remarkable style and was well-read. American Mennonite historian Theron Schlabach described him as \"the most systematic thelogian of any nineteenth-century Mennonite group\". However, John Funk was highly critical of Musser's book The Reformed Mennonite Church and her accusers.\nAlthough Musser and Tolstoy agreed on nonresistance, Musser's views on government and human nature differed sharply from those of Tolstoy: Musser saw humans as basically evil, neededing governments to control them; Tolstoy, on the other hand, saw governments as inherently evil, and humans as essentially good.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNonresistance\nReformed Mennonite\nMennonites\nNonviolence\nPeace churches\nTolstoyan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMusser, Daniel (1873).

        "content": "Fort Pemberton is a historic artillery battery located at Leflore County, Greenwood, Mississippi. It was built in early 1863 during the Vicksburg Campaign of American Civil War. The fort was located on the route of the Yazoo Pass, near the confluence of the Tallahatchie and Yalobusha Rivers (which merge there to form the Yazoo River). Fort Pemberton was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 19, 1973.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nIn the winter of 1862–1863, Major General Ulysses S. Grant commanding the Army of the Tennessee conducted a series of operations to approach and capture the fortified city of Vicksburg, Mississippi, known as \"The Gibraltar of the Confederacy\". Since the city's fortifications on bluffs overlooking the Mississippi River were formidable, Grant tried other alternatives that wouldn't require a direct approach under the Confederate guns.\nIn the opening engagement of the Vicksburg Campaign, an advance on Vicksburg from the north by troops under the command of Union Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman was repulsed by Confederate forces under Lt. Gen.  John C. Pemberton at the December 26–29, 1862 Battle of Chickasaw Bayou. There the Union troops also encountered formidable bluff top fortifications. Following this setback, Grant tried several waterborne alternatives. Termed \"Grant's bayou operations\", the idea was to find or construct alternative water routes so that troops could be brought within striking distance of Vicksburg. One of these operations was the Yazoo Pass expedition, a joint operation with Rear Admiral David D. Porter's Mississippi River Squadron.\nThe Yazoo Pass was an old water route from Memphis to Yazoo City, which had been closed off by Mississippi River levee construction in 1856 that sealed the Pass. Winding through a series of backwaters of the Mississippi Delta, the Pass had run from the Mississippi River into Moon Lake, to the Coldwater River, then to the Tallahatchie River, and finally into the Yazoo River at Greenwood, Mississippi. From there the Yazoo River continued south to Yazoo City and Vicksburg. Once on the Yazoo north of the defenses of Vicksburg, the Navy could disrupt Confederate shipping at Yazoo City, and the Army would be able to cross the river with scant opposition and secure a bridgehead and supply line.\n\n\n== Fort Pemberton ==\n\nThe Union force began moving through the Yazoo Pass on February 7. But lack of urgency by the Union Navy, coupled with low-hanging tree branches and trees felled by Confederates impeded their progress, allowing the Confederates time to prepare defenses. Pemberton had given orders to Major General William W. Loring to stop the Union advance. At Greenwood, Mississippi there existed a narrow neck of land bordered by the Tallahatchie and the Yazoo Rivers. There, Loring's men hastily built fortifications at an approximate forty-five degree angle from northeast to southwest, made of cotton bales and logs covered by layers of dirt, with parapets ten feet high. There they mounted a pair of heavy guns and named the earthworks \"Fort Pemberton\". The Confederate troops at the fort repulsed the attempts by the Union force on March 11, March 14, March 16, and March 23, halting the Union advance, and ending the Yazoo pass expedition.\n\n\n== Today ==\nFort Pemberton is now part of Fort Pemberton Memorial Park, in Greenwood, Mississippi.\n\n\n== References ==",
