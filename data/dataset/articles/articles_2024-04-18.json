        "content": "The Copa del Rey de Vela is a sailing competition held in Palma de Mallorca, Spain, organized by the Real Club Náutico de Palma. Its current commercial name is Copa del Rey MAPFRE, due to the sponsorship of the MAPFRE company. Previous sponsors were the Puig companies (1985–2006); Audi and Camper (2007); and Audi and MAPFRE (2008–2012).​ It is the most important cruising sailing regatta in the Mediterranean Sea.​\nThe Copa del Rey was established by Alfonso XIII in 1905. Under the reign of Juan Carlos I, the competition was reinstated in 1982, being celebrated in Palma de Mallorca, traditionally held in the Bay of Palma, and organized by the Real Club Náutico de Palma. Passionate about this sport, in which he was an Olympian in the 1972 Games, Don Juan Carlos won the prestigious Palma tournament five times and continues to be, along with Pedro Campos, the most successful skipper in the history of the competition. Along with him, in his crew or in rival boats, all the great figures of sailing, Spanish and international, have competed in the Copa del Rey.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe Copa del Rey was established by Alfonso XIII in 1905, in imitation of the competitions that were held in Cowes, with the patronage of the King of England, or in Kiel, with that of the Emperor of Germany, and it was held for the first time in Getxo, the King's summer resort, organized by the Real Sporting Club, within the so-called Bilbao Week.​\nBetween 1912 and 1919, it was held in Gijón, organized by the Real Club Astur de Regatas (RCAR), and with the participation of Alfonso XIII in the 1912 and 1913 editions. The people of Gijón already knew the monarch from his visit in 1900, when a teenage Alfonso XIII made a triumphal entry accompanied by the queen regent Maria Christina of Austria, but now the circumstances were different, and in the first edition held in Gijón, on 20 July 1912, Alfonso XIII himself won the Copa del Rey, for yachts of 8, 7, and 6 Metre, skippering the \"Giralda II\". At the time, RCAR was not even a year old and the transfer of land for the construction of the summer pavilion in the old San Pedro battery had not been resolved, so the authorities and personalities attending those first sailing competitions had to enjoy the regatta from an improvised terrace, which was located in the same place where the club would build its facilities shortly after. In the 2012 Summer Olympics, RCAR won a gold medal thanks to Ángela Pumariega, an excellent triumph that coincided precisely with the year that marks the centenary of the first regattas held in the bay of Gijón by the RCAR.\n\n\n=== Recent history ===\nUnder the reign of Juan Carlos I, the competition was reinstated, and in its first two editions it was held under the protection of the International Mediterranean Championship (IMC), which Spain was to organize, which meant that, from its origin, it was a calling for sailors from many countries. The number of participants in its debut exceeded fifty for a total of 58 boats, of which 35 were Spanish, many of them being attracted by the IMC, the setting in which the first two editions were held.​ The first boat to engrave its name in the winners' list was the Italian \"Nat\", a One tonner owned by Carla Toffoloni. It was a complete success, and that premiere established a level that the RCN of Palma no longer wanted to give up.\nThe relevance of that first edition was such that in the following year, the spectacular Maxis also attended, luxurious sailboats of great length that contributed to giving an atmosphere of a great nautical exhibition in Palma. The splendor of the regatta increased at the same time as the Spanish high competition fleet itself and in 1983 the victory was won by a Balearic boat, the \"Barracuda\" of the Mallorcan Pepín González. González soon died in an accident, but the Copa del Rey honors his memory with a trophy that since 1990 has rewarded the best Spanish design.\nThe 1984 and 1985 editions witnessed the dominance of the Bribón IV, owned by the Catalan shipowner José Cusí, and established the tradition of King Don Juan Carlos sailing in \"his\" regatta. He would win it again in 1993, with Bribón VIII; and again in 1994, with the Bribón IX, and in 2000 with the powerful 53-foot (16-meter-long) sailboat designed by Bruce Farr. The 2011 edition saw the farewell of the Bribón, the sailboat on which King Juan Carlos I competed for almost four decades, so the event brought together very special characteristics.\nThe 1985 edition marked the entry of the Puig family as sponsors of the regatta, and with Puig's drive, 1988 had a total of 106 registered boats, exceeding one hundred for the first time, and of them 38 were new and 34 were sponsored, which gives an idea of ​​the importance that the sailing spectacle had achieved in the bay of Palma. The 1987 edition was scored for the Maxi class world circuit.\nIn the early 1990s, the tables turned and the traditional hegemony of foreign units gave way to a new batch of Spanish owners, skippers, and crew who took the podium in the first five years of the 90s. Names such as Josele and Noluco Doreste, José Luis Suevos, Pedro Campos, and Jaime Yllera registered their triumphs between 1990 and 1995, opening the way for the national sailors who would come later. Cusí's \"Bribon\" also did not want to miss out, taking two new victories in 1993 and 1994, adding to his record a total of four Copas del Rey.\nThe last five years once again spoke almost exclusively Spanish. In addition to winning projects by established owners such as José Cusí (the \"Bribón\" won its fifth title in 2000), others emerged, such as the \"Cutty Sark\" by Pelayo de la Mata, which won in the 1996 and 1997 editions. Furthermore, José Luis Suevos would win his second Copa del Rey title with \"Nationale Neddelanden\" in 1997.\nAt the beginning of the decade, the dominant party was \"Caixa Galicia\" created by Vicente Tirado and designed by Botín & Carkeek, which achieved a milestone: winning the Copa del Rey three consecutive years: 2002, 2003, and 2004. The 2003 edition also experienced a notable sporting event, such as the participation of numerous Copa América sailors on board national and international projects, a fact that considerably increased the prestige of the Copa del Rey MAPFRE. Other notable milestones at this time were the double victory in 2008 of \"El Desafío\", which became the first team to achieve victory in two different classes (TP52 and GP42) in the same year.\nDespite the imminent celebration of the 2012 Olympic Games and the World Tour having ended just two weeks earlier, a total of 110 boats still gathered in the bay of Palma divided into a total of seven classes in which foreign representatives dominated. In 2013, Prince Felipe VI, who participated as patron of \"Aifos\", presided over the awards ceremony held in Ses Voltes.\n\n\n== System changes ==\nThe first system that was used produced a single winner of the Copa del Rey each year, but in 1988, the IMS system also came into action, so from then on there was a winner in each division. In 1994, the IMS was divided into Racing and Cruising, because the evolution of the designs made it unfeasible, and unfair, to group all the boats in the same classification. In 1992 and 1994, the barrier of one hundred participants was again surpassed, despite the fact that the fleet was immersed in the transition from IOR to IMS and the subsequent adaptations of the ships from one system to another. Neither the economic crisis of 1993 nor the gradual disappearance of the IOR units affected a Copa del Rey that gave unequivocal signs of having a life of its own and aspiring to become the top regatta event in the Mediterranean. In 1998 an attempt was made to find a formula that would give a single winner: A fleet of 127 boats was grouped into three divisions: IMS Regatta, IMS Cruise-Regatta, and IMS Cruise, but in such a way that a single joint classification ended up emerging. With 127 boats, the Copa del Rey became the most important cruising competition in the world that year.\nThe surprise was the victory of a production boat, the \"Estrella Damm\", by Ignacio Montes de León, a Beneteau First 40.7 from the Cruise-Regatta division, who managed to beat sailboats of much higher rank with a relatively modest budget. The controversy was immediate, and the result was that the following year, in 1999, the fleet was grouped by length, that is, by size: a Group A for the largest and fastest and a Group B for the smallest ones, so everything was much more coherent on the race course. In Group A there was also the rebirth of Spanish designs after the old success of 1983, since it was won by Manuel Chirivella's \"Zurich\", a 46-footer designed by the Cantabrian Marcelino Botín, who today is part of the elite of the best naval architects of the world. Ever since, groups A and B ended up being called IMS 500 and 600, respectively.\n\n\n== Sponsors ==\nThe 1985 edition marked the entry of the Puig family as sponsors of the regatta through its Agua Brava brand, which opened a twenty-year collaboration that translated into an increasingly greater sporting and social dimension of the competition. In 2007 Audi took over the perfumery firm. In 2008, the insurance company Mapfre also joined as a sponsor, replacing Camper. Currently, Audi and Mapfre are the two major sponsoring companies of the event.\nThe last decade of the 20th century and the first of the 21st were the golden era due to the proliferation of projects sponsored by the main commercial brands.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The military history of Liechtenstein originates back to its predecessors in the County of Vaduz  and Lordship of Schellenberg. Liechtenstein disbanded its army in 1868, and has had no standing army since. However, under the constitution of Liechtenstein citizens are still obligated to defend the country in the event of an external threat and the army may be reformed if deemed necessary.\n\n\n== Middle ages ==\n\nBoth the County of Vaduz and the Lordship of Schellenberg respectively held regional militias tasked with the defending of their territories, primarily compositioned of Ministerialis. Similarly to their neighbour Switzerland men of both states would enlist as mercenaries to fight in foreign conflicts, primarily in France, Naples, Netherlands, Austria and the Papal States. Most notably, such mercenaries saw significant action during the Swabian War of 1499, where Vaduz was invaded and burned by Swiss troops.\nDue to concerns of further Swiss invasion as a result of continued tensions between Switzerland and Austria, both the County of Vaduz and Lordship of Schellenberg signed a defensive alliance with Austria in 1505, in which the Vaduz Castle and local militias was placed at the disposal of the House of Habsburg in return for an annual payment. Liechtenstein was obligated to provide a military force to the Swabian Circle of the Holy Roman Empire since its formation in the early 15th century, which was maintained until its dissolution its in 1803.\nDuring the Thirty Years' War, the area that was to become Liechtenstein was invaded by both Austrian and then later Swedish forces. As a result, notable actions by units included the defence of Bregenz against Swedish forces in 1647.\n\n\n== Eighteenth and Nineteenth century ==\nBoth the County of Vaduz and the Lordship of Schellenberg were procured by Johann Adam Andreas of Liechtenstein in 1699 and 1712 respectively, and both were merged to form the principality of Liechtenstein under decree by Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor. As such, militias of both states merged under the command of the House of Liechtenstein, of which consisted of 19 men in 1714.\n\nIn the War of the First Coalition, Liechtenstein, as part of the Holy Roman Empire contributed approximately 20 troops to the coalition forces from 1793 to 1796. During the War of the Second Coalition, France invaded the country on 6 March 1799 and plundered several towns, including Nendeln that was burned by French troops, which resulted in the deaths of four people. The Austrian and Volgraberg state militias under command by Lieutenant field marshal Franjo Jelačić defeated 18,000 French troops stationed in Liechtenstein under command of General André Masséna and liberated the country by 14 May. The French occupied Liechtenstein for a few years until it gained its independence again in 1815. Liechtenstein shortly afterwards joined the German Confederation, in which it was also obligated to provide a military force, which initially consisted of 55 men. In the same year, Liechtenstein's sovereignty was guaranteed by Austria, Russia and Prussia as a member Holy Alliance under Austria.\nOn 15 June 1859 Peter Rheinberger was promoted by Johann II to first lieutenant and placed in command of the Liechtenstein military, being the only Liechtensteiner to hold this position. In this position, along with Andreas Walch, he oversaw its reorganisation and the administrative running of the military, of which now was expanded to consist of 82 men.\n\nDuring the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, Prince Johann II placed his soldiers at the disposal of the Confederation but only to “defend the German territory of Tyrol”. However, the newly-formed Landtag of Liechtenstein had not been consulted regarding the deployment and the war was unpopular among the population, as such it faced resistance from the Landtag. As a result, Johann II promised a loan to the country and refused to have his men fight against other Germans. The Liechtenstein contingent took up position on the Stilfser Joch under the command of Peter Rheinberger in the south of Liechtenstein to defend the Liechtenstein/Austrian border against attacks by the Italians under Giuseppe Garibaldi. A reserve of 2 men remained in Liechtenstein at Vaduz Castle. When the war ended on 22 July, the army of Liechtenstein marched home to a ceremonial welcome in Vaduz. Popular legend claims that 80 men went to war but 81 came back. Though it is disputed who this person was, apparently an Austrian liaison officer joined up with the contingent on the way back, whereas it has also been claimed that it was an Italian farmer.\nThe German Confederation dissolved in 1866. In combination with the its unpopularity among the population and the rising cost to maintain it, Liechtenstein disbanded its army of 80 men on 12 February 1868 and declared its permanent neutrality. In 1893, former soldiers of the Liechtenstein army founded a veterans association, which had 141 members in 1896. Its last surviving member, Andreas Kieber, died in 1939, aged 94 years old.\n\n\n== Modern era ==\nThough Liechtenstein was neutral throughout World War I, it was closely tied to Austria-Hungary due to the customs union between the two countries and was sympathetic to the Central Powers. Foreign citizens living in Liechtenstein were conscripted into the armies of their respective home countries, primarily Austria-Hungary and Germany, of which 27 did not return. In addition, many Liechtensteiners also voluntarily enlisted in both armies, including several members of the House of Liechtenstein. In total, 4 Liechtenstein citizens are known to have been killed in the war despite the country being neutral, including Prince Heinrich of Liechtenstein, who is the highest member of the house of Liechtenstein to have been killed in action. Three Liechtensteiners were imprisoned for espionage during the war.\nIn 1918, Austria-Hungary collapsed and could no longer act a military guarantee on Liechtenstein. Starting from August 1919, the Liechtenstein government pushed an initiative through the Landtag of Liechtenstein to form a civil defence force to replace the military security previously provided by Austria-Hungary. It was approved on 8 March 1921, though the defence force was never established, and it was eventually repealed in 1925. In 1924, Liechtenstein and Switzerland entered a customs union which deemed the proposition of a new Liechtenstein military unnecessary.\n\nDuring World War II, Liechtenstein remained neutral. The country sought to align itself as closely as possible with Switzerland during the war in hopes of retaining the country's neutrality and achieved the de facto inclusion of Liechtenstein in the Swiss national supply. Despite this, Prime Minister of Liechtenstein Josef Hoop did not reconsider the reformation of a Liechtenstein military  in order to avoid provocation with Nazi Germany. Switzerland protected Liechtenstein's independence throughout the war. However, there were figures both inside and outside of Liechtenstein who used the country in order to recruit Liechtensteiners into the Waffen-SS and gain public sympathy for the Nazi cause, which infuriated Switzerland. During the war, several Liechtensteiners served in both the Waffen-SS and the Schutzpolizei. Liechtenstein was intended to be invaded and annexed by Nazi Germany alongside Switzerland in Operation Tannenbaum. In contrast with Swiss national defence plans to abandon the low regions in favour of the Swiss Alps, Liechtenstein was not planned to be directly defended by the Swiss army in the case of a German invasion.\n\nThe nuclear threat throughout the Cold War led to the expansion of civil defence since the 1960s in Liechtenstein. From 1964 to 1965, the Liechtenstein government built a command bunker with protection against nuclear bombs in Vaduz. In the 21st-century, the Liechtenstein National Police is responsible for keeping order within the country. It consists of 87 field officers and 38 civilian staff, totaling 125 employees. All officers are equipped with small arms. However, under the constitution of Liechtenstein every citizen is required to defend the country in the event of an external threat, and the military may be reformed at any time is deemed necessary. The country has faced several accidental military incidents involving Switzerland, ranging from 1968 to 2007, though these were all disregarded. \n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of Liechtenstein\nSwiss incursions into Liechtenstein\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nPeter Geiger (1970).

        "content": "The Ballynafagh Bog (Irish: Portach Baile na Faiche) Special Area of Conservation or SAC is a Natura 2000 site in County Kildare, close to the town of Prosperous in County Kildare, Ireland. The three qualifying interests by which this site is protected as an SAC are the presence of active raised bog, of degraded raised bogs still capable of natural regeneration, and of depressions on peat substrates of the Rhynchosporion.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe Ballynafagh Bog SAC is located close to Prosperous, in the townlands of Ballynafagh, Coolree (E.D. Robertstown) and Downings North, County Kildare. Schedule 1 of the Statutory Instrument for this site (S.I. No. 141/2017) identifies it as encompassing an area of 155.23 hectares. A detailed map of the are is included in the National Parks and Wildlife Service Conservation Objectives for the site.\n\n\n== Special Area of Conservation qualification ==\nThe Ballynafagh Bog site was designated as a Natura 2000 site (‘Site of Community Importance’ or SCI) in 1997 under the Habitats Directive. Statutory Instrument No. 141 of 2017, establishing the site as an SAC (Site code: 000391), was passed in 2017. The ecological features which qualify this site for an SAC designation are\n\nActive raised bogs (priority feature) [Natura 2000 code 7110]\nDegraded raised bogs still capable of natural regeneration [Natura 2000 code 7120]\nDepressions on peat substrates of the Rhynchosporion [Natura 2000 code 7150] \nThe Biodiversity Information System for Europe website notes that Ballynafagh Bog is one of the most easterly examples of a relatively intact raised bog in Ireland. There are only two of these type of sites in County Kildare (the other being Mouds Bog). \nThe Ballynafagh Bog site is also a proposed National Heritage Area site or pNHA.\nClose to the Ballynafagh Bog SAC is the Ballynafagh Lake SAC, which is also a pNHA.\n\n\n== Features ==\nThe Ballynafagh Bog site includes approximately 70 hectares of uncut high bog. The high bog includes an area of 23 hectares of wet active bog, and approximately 44 hectares of degraded raised bog which is drying out. This area is surrounded by a larger area of approximately 90 hectares of cutover bog.\n\n\n=== Active raised bog ===\nOf the three features qualifying this site as an SAC, the priority ecological feature of this site is the presence of active raised bog, where there is a high, wet, peat-forming bog with a high percentage cover of Sphagnum spp., and where some or all of these features are present: hummocks, pools, wet flats, Sphagnum lawns, flushes and/or soaks. The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) Site Synopsis notes that there is a system of tear pools at the wet, active, peat-forming area towards the centre of the bog. These are overgrown with the bog mosses Sphagnum capillifolium and Sphagnum magellanicum. A pool-and-hummock system occurs at this site, where the pools contain a further bog moss species: Sphagnum cuspidatum. Other key plants occurring in wet channels here include white beak-sedge, cottongrasses (Eriophorum spp.) and great sundew (Drosera anglica). These plants proliferate in this wet channels, while on the hummocks bog rosemary (Andromeda polifolia) and cranberry (Vaccinium oxycoccos) are to be found.\n\n\n=== Degraded raised bogs ===\nThe Ballynafagh Bog also includes areas of degraded raised bogs capable of regeneration – these are sections of the raised bog where the hydrology of the system has been negatively impacted by factors such as drainage, peat-cutting or other land use activities, but for which regeneration of this ecosystem is still possible. The flora in the degraded areas of the bog includes bog asphodel, cross-leaved heath (Erica tetralix), deergrass, hare's-tail cottongrass (Eriophorum vaginatum) and heather (Calluna vulgaris). In this area, the peat is dry (rather than wet as in the active raised bog), and supports colonisation by downy birch (Betula pubescens) and gorse (Ulex europaeus). Heather, as well as the moss Hypnum cupressiforme, grow in the driest areas of the high bog dome. In the cutaway bog at the site, the plant life includes rushes (Juncus spp.) and common cottongrass (Eriophorum angustifolium). Downy birch grows in patches of woodland.\n\n\n=== Depressions on peat substrates of the Rhynchosporion ===\nThe third feature that qualifies Ballynafagh Bog as an SAC is the presence of a specific habitat: depressions on peat substrates of the Rhynchosporion. This comprises: \n\n“Highly constant pioneer communities of humid exposed peat or, sometimes, sand, with Rhynchospora alba, Rhynchospora fusca, Drosera intermedia, Drosera rotundifolia, and Lycopodiella inundata, forming on stripped areas of blanket bogs or raised bogs, but also on naturally seep- or frost-eroded areas of wet heaths and bogs, in flushes and in the fluctuation zone of oligotrophic pools with sandy, slightly peaty substratum. These communities are similar, and closely related, to those of shallow bog hollows (Pal. 51.122) and of transition mires (Pal. 54.57).”\n\nAt this site, the Rhynchosporion habitat is to be found in erosion channels, pool edges and wet depressions. The flora includes white beak-sedge (Rhynchospora alba) and brown beak-sedge (Rhynchospora fusca). It also includes bog asphodel (Narthecium ossifragum), sundews (Drosera spp.), deergrass (Scirpus cespitosus) and/or carnation sedge (Carex panicea).\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nProtected bird species recorded at this site include merlin (Falco columbarius), snipe (Gallinago gallinago) and curlew (Numenius arquata).\n\n\n== Conservation objectives ==\nThe conservation objectives for the Ballynafagh Bog site were published in 2015. \nThe primary conservation objective for the site is to restore the favourable conservation condition of the active raised bog. The long-term aim for the degraded raised bog habitat is to re-establish its peat-forming capability, which is linked to the conservation objective for the active raised bog. The existence of the ‘Depressions on peat substrates of the Rhynchosporion’ habitat is a feature of good quality active raised bogs. For these reasons, separate conservation objectives are not set for these two habitats.\nA key conservation objective for the raised bog is to restore the are of this site to 26.6 hectares (subject to natural processes). In 2014, the active raised bog was mapped as comprising an area of 6.5 hectares. The degraded raised bog area was mapped at 9.9 hectares. Of this, only 6.9 hectares can feasibly be restored to active raised bog (by means of drain blocking), giving a total potential restoration of 13.4 hectares of active raised bog. A further 13.2 hectares of the cutover section of the site was estimated to be restorable also, giving a total of 26.6 hectares of restored active raised bog as a conservation objective.\nThe restoration plan for Ballynafagh Bog SAC to meet the conservation targets for the site were published in 2022.\n\n\n== Threats ==\nThe EUNIS website lists the known threats to this SAC. Peat extraction is ranked as the highest threat to the site. Listed as medium-level threats are: Forest planting on open ground; improved access to site; and other human intrusions and disturbances. Recorded as low-level threats to the site are fire and fire suppression; and Other patterns of habitation. In 2018, a plan to relocate turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog to Coolree bog (considered a degraded bog) was proposed, however, planning for this was rejected as it would entail re-opening an inactive bog for turf cutting and would be contrary to the proper planning and sustainable development of the area and to climate action policy objectives, and because it would set an undesirable precedent for further development of inactive bogs and result in a loss of natural landscape.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Spot!\" (stylized in all caps) is a song by South Korean rapper Zico featuring South Korean singer Jennie. It will be released as a digital single on April 26, 2024, through KOZ Entertainment. An accompanying music video will be uploaded to YouTube simultaneously with the single's release.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter completing his military conscription in May 2022, Zico made his return to music with the release of his fourth extended play Grown Ass Kid on July 27, which contained the pre-release single \"Seoul Drift\" and title track \"Freak\". The EP was moderately successful and peaked at number 11 on the Circle Album Chart with 16,085 copies sold in its first week.\nIn December 2023, YG Entertainment confirmed that Jennie of South Korean girl group Blackpink did not renew her contract with the label for individual activities. The singer announced the formation of her own music label for solo activities in November named Odd Atelier. Since establishing her independent label, Jennie released the single \"Slow Motion\" on March 8, 2024, a collaboration with former Brockhampton member Matt Champion for his debut studio album, Mika's Laundry (2024). She also made appearances on various South Korean broadcast programs such as The Seasons: Lee Hyo-ri's Red Carpet and Apartment 404.\nA representative from Zico's agency, KOZ Entertainment, confirmed on April 2, 2024, that the rapper was preparing a new song to be released at the end of the month, celebrating the tenth anniversary of his solo debut. Local news outlet TenAsia reported on April 4 that Jennie would feature on the song and appear in its music video. In response to the reports, KOZ Entertainment confirmed Zico's comeback but not Jennie's involvement, stating that \"it is difficult to confirm other matters.\"\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nOn April 18, Zico posted a 20-second video on social media of him and Jennie in a recording studio singing and dancing along to a snippet of their upcoming single featuring her vocals.  Shortly afterwards, he posted another photo teaser captioned \"Come vibe with us\" of the two artists looking at Polaroid pictures of themselves. Zico then officially revealed the new collaboration titled \"Spot!\" and its release date of April 26, alongside a schedule of teaser photos and videos from April 19 to 25.\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Cameron Joseph Booser (born May 4, 1992) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB). He made his MLB debut in 2024 at age 31.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBooser attended Fife High School in Fife, Washington, and played for the school's baseball team as a pitcher and first baseman. He was named his league's most valuable player in 2009. Booser broke his femur during his sophomore year of high school while playing football, requiring knee surgery. He also broke a vertebra when he was a senior while lifting weights. Booser enrolled at Oregon State University to play college baseball for the Oregon State Beavers. Booser had Tommy John surgery during his freshman year of college and transferred to Central Arizona College.\nThe Minnesota Twins signed Booser as an undrafted free agent in 2013. He had surgery in August 2015 to correct a labrum tear. In December 2015, he broke his sacrum when he was hit by a car. After making three appearances in the 2017 season, Booser retired. Booser returned to the Seattle area to work as a carpenter. Missing baseball, he began to give pitching lessons in 2020, and found that he could throw a fastball at 96 miles per hour (154 km/h).\nBooser came out of retirement in 2021 to pitch in independent league baseball for the Chicago Dogs of the American Association of Professional Baseball. He pitched to a 1.93 earned run average (ERA) in 23+1⁄3 innings pitched. He signed with the Arizona Diamondbacks in February 2022 and pitched for the Amarillo Sod Poodles of the Double-A Texas League. He was released in July. The next month, he signed with the Lancaster Barnstormers of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, an independent league.\nIn February 2023, Booser signed with the Boston Red Sox and pitched for the Worcester Red Sox of the Triple-A International League. In 2024, the Red Sox invited him to spring training as a non-roster player. On April 19, 2024, Booser was selected to the 40-man roster and promoted to the major leagues for the first time. He made his major-league debut that evening, against the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCareer statistics and player information from Baseball Reference (Minors)",

        "content": "Ghatixalus asterops, the Ghat tree frog or starry-eyed Ghat tree frog, is a species of frog in the subfamily Rhacophorinae.  It is endemic to India's Western Ghat mountains, specifically the Palani Hills and south of the Palghat Gaps.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe adult male frog measures about 38.8 mm – 44.8 mm in snout-vent length and a single adult female specimen 58.1 mm. Adult frogs can vary in color between individuals. The skin of the dorsum can be dark gray or light gray in color with brown marks or it can be yellow-brown in color with red marks. The skin near the tympanum, which is readily visible, is light gray with brown spots. The sides of the body are yellow with some brown color. The four feet are light blue-white with blue-brown marks on the webbed skin. The upper hind legs are blue-brown in color. The iris of the eye is brown in color with thick gold lines in a shape resembling a star. There is also a gold circle around the outside of the iris. Juvenile frogs can be light green or light brown in color. Adults are never green in color.\n\n\n== Habitat ==\nPeople have observed this frog in disturbed shola forest habitats high in the hills.  People have seen it in the dead leaves on the ground. These frogs spend more time near ephemeral streams than near permanent streams. People have also observed it on tea farms. This frog stays between 1300 and 2000 meters above sea level. This frog is terrestrial, not arboreal like other Rhacophoridae. When disturbed, this frog will hide in the water for several minutes.\n\n\n== Life cycle ==\nThe female frog makes a nest out of foam on rocks in the stream, on the sides of the stream, or sometimes on tree trunks near the stream. The eggs hatch into tadpoles that live in rocky streams with briskly flowing water. The tadpoles have substantial oral suckers that they use to anchor themselves in the current.\n\n\n== Threats ==\nScientists believe this frog is in limited danger of dying out because it lives in such a small place. Scientists cite climate change and habitat fragmentation as threats to this frog.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nScientists classify this frog is sister species to Ghatixalus variabilis.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "St Edward's Church is the parish church of Brotherton, a village in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThe first church on the site was constructed in about 1300, but it was rebuilt in 1842 and 1843, at a cost of £3250.  Of this, £2000 was donated by the Ramsden family, to whom there are several memorials within the church.  The church was grade II listed in 1967.  By this time, the church was overshadowed by the cooling towers of one of the Ferrybridge power stations, a view illustrated in one of Eric de Maré's most famous photographs.  The cooling towers were later demolished.\nThe church is built of millstone grit with a Welsh slate roof, and is in Gothic Revival style.  It consists of a nave, north and south aisles, a chancel with a north aisle and a south vestry, and a west tower.  The tower has two stages, diagonal buttresses rising to pinnacles, two-light bell openings with hood moulds, and an embattled parapet.  The aisles also have embattled parapets, and the windows are in Perpendicular style with hood moulds.  Inside, the nave has two galleries, and there are assorted wall monuments, the earliest dating from 1686.  The east window of the north aisle has stained glass manufactured by William Holland in 1858.\n\n\n== See also ==\nListed buildings in Brotherton\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "On 16 June 2016, during the final week of campaigning before the Brexit referendum, Nigel Farage of the UK Independence Party unveiled a poster which depicted a photograph of Syrian refugees near the Croatia-Slovenia border in 2015, with the caption \"breaking point\" and \"the EU has failed us all\".\nPart of a £100,000 campaign from Family Advertising Ltd, an advertising firm based in Edinburgh, The poster was denounced by left- and right-wing politicians, and several media outlets highlighted the poster's similarity to propaganda in Nazi Germany. The same photograph was later used by the Hungarian Fidesz party in another poster during the build up to the 2018 Hungarian parliamentary election.\n\n\n== Poster design and unveiling ==\nThe photograph, which takes up the entire billboard, was taken in October 2015 near the Croatia-Slovenia border by Getty Images photographer Jeff Mitchell, and depicts a large group of predominantly adult male Syrian and Afghan refugees, almost all of whom had dark skin, who were being taken to the Brežice refugee camp, escorted by Slovenian police. There is one prominent white person visible in the original photograph; this person is covered by a box of text on the poster. In the photo, the people follow a path between two fields from its top left to its central foreground. UKIP purchased a commercial licence from Getty Images to use the image.\nThe photograph is captioned with the words \"breaking point\" in large red block capitals, above \"the EU has failed us all\" in smaller white text. It also features a lower bar with the text \"we must break free of the EU and take back control of our borders\", with a white box with the text \"leave the European Union on 23 June\" and a cross in a box in the bottom right corner.\nNigel Farage, then leader of the UK Independence Party, unveiled the poster in June 2016 in Westminster, during the final week before the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. It was placed to take up an entire side of a Leave.EU campaign van.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\n\n\n=== Immediate reactions ===\nThe poster was condemned by politicians campaigning against Brexit. Then Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon stated that it was \"disgusting\", and Labour Party MP Yvette Cooper said \"just when you thought leave campaigners couldn’t stoop any lower, they are now exploiting the misery of the Syrian refugee crisis in the most dishonest and immoral way.\" The Green Party's Caroline Lucas said that \"using the innocent victims of a human tragedy for political propaganda is utterly disgusting. Farage is engaging in the politics of the gutter.\" Dave Prentis of the Unison trade union said he had written to the Metropolitan Police to complain of the poster, stating that it was a \"blatant attempt to incite racial hatred\" and that \"to pretend that migration to the UK is only about people who are not white is to peddle the racism that has no place in a modern, caring society\".\nRight-wing politicians also distanced themselves from the poster. Boris Johnson distanced the official Vote Leave campaign from UKIP after the reveal, stating that it was \"not our campaign\" and \"not my politics\". On The Andrew Marr Show, then justice secretary Michael Gove said that \"when I saw that poster I shuddered. I thought it was the wrong thing to do. I am pro-migration but I believe that the way in which we secure public support for the continued benefits that migration brings and the way in which we secure public support for helping refugees in need is if people feel they can control the numbers overall coming here.\" Similarly, George Osborne said that \"there is a difference between addressing those concerns in a reasonable way and whipping up concerns, whipping up division, making baseless assertions that millions of people are going to come into the country in the next couple of years from Turkey, saying that dead bodies are going to wash up on the beaches of Kent, or indeed putting up that disgusting and vile poster that Nigel Farage did, which had echoes of literature used in the 1930s.\" Conservative MP Neil Carmichael said that it was \"disappointing to see UKIP jumping on the refugee crisis to further their own political aims. Britain can only deal with the issue of immigration by working together with European countries that face the same challenges.\" Former UKIP MP Douglas Carswell called the poster \"morally indefensible\".\nJonathan Jones of The Guardian stated that the poster was \"the visual equivalent of Enoch Powell’s 'rivers of blood' speech,\" also comparing its visual language of a snaking queue to that of the unemployed people in the Conservatives' 1979 Labour Isn't Working poster. Twitter users also made comparisons to Nazi propaganda footage of Jewish refugees, later shown in the 2005 BBC documentary Auschwitz: The Nazis and 'The Final Solution'. When Indy100 reported these comparisons, UKIP responded that they \"utterly reject the association, and would like to point out that Godwin's law applies here.\"\nGetty Images made a statement on the matter that \"it is always uncomfortable when an objective news photograph is used to deliver any political message or subjective agenda. However, the image in question has been licensed legitimately\". Jeff Mitchell, who took the photograph, told The Guardian that its use by UKIP was \"unfortunate\".\nWhen challenged, Farage stated that the poster was \"accurate\" and \"undoctored\", and that Angela Merkel's migration policies concerning people who crossed the Mediterranean had made the EU \"less safe\". He responded to Michael Gove on ITV's Peston, stating that the Vote Leave campaign had also created \"very strong\" posters concerning immigration, and later stated in an appearance on Sky News that the poster was only the campaign's message for \"one day\", and that other adverts would be used later. He also stated in an interview that the poster \"was not about Britain\", but that \"it was about Schengen, about the fact Schengen is breaking\".\n\n\n=== After the Brexit referendum ===\nIn July 2016, an online petition signed by nearly 40,000 people asked police to investigate whether the poster was \"systematically and purposefully designed to incite and stir up fear and intolerance of immigrants in order to procure votes\", and claimed that the spike in hate crime following the referendum was \"a direct consequence\" of UKIP's rhetoric during its campaign.\nIn late 2017 in an interview with the New Statesman, Farage stated that \"Jacob [Rees-Mogg] says he thinks that poster won the referendum, because it dominated the debate for the last few days. The establishment hated it, the posh boys at Vote Leave hated it, but it was the right thing to do. Now, I don’t think we’d have won the referendum without Mrs Merkel. But that poster reminded people what Mrs Merkel had done.\" In May 2019 on The Andrew Marr Show, Farage defended the use of the poster by UKIP but said that it would not be used by his Brexit Party because \"immigration isn't the burning issue of the time\".\nFred Sirieix confronted Farage over the poster on an episode of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! broadcast in November 2023, calling the poster \"shameful\".\n\n\n== Hungarian use of the photograph ==\nThe same photograph was used in an anti-immigration advertisement by the Hungarian Fidesz party, published on 26 March 2018, during the Hungarian parliamentary election. This poster added a large red stop sign graphic over the photograph, obscured the presence of the white man in the photograph, and additionally cropped out the only woman visible in the original photograph. On social media, it came with a caption stating that \"The government's information campaign on the migration starts into its new phase. The government wants to highlight the fact that the UN's migration guidelines would allow more immigration. We think that immigration poses a serious risk, therefore it must be stopped. The advertisements in this topic will run until the 15th of April.\"\n\n\n== Academic analysis ==\nSimon Faulkner, Hannah Guy and Farida Vis note that the combination of the image and text in the poster \"displaced the meaning of the photograph from being about the movement of a specific group of refugees in Slovenia [...] to being about the purported effect of EU border policies on immigration into the UK. This shift in meaning also involved a shift in the function of the image from being a standard example of photojournalism (and therefore primarily valued for its documentary content) to a political concern to use the image to emphasise connotations of racialised otherness in relation to immigration.\" They stated that the photograph allowed both UKIP and Fidesz to express a \"racially charged message\" while \"allowing them a degree of deniability\" as they did not need to articulate the ideas explicitly. They also noted that the UKIP poster was less \"direct\" and \"univocal\" compared to the Fidesz poster, and suggested that the \"breaking point\" slogan referred to a \"duality\", representing both the 'breaking' of the EU and UK borders.\nGiorgia Aiello in the Journal of Visual Political Communication expanded on this, noting that \"from a strictly political point of view,\" the poster \"was not 'effective' – unlike the 'Vote Leave' campaign’s NHS bus\".\nOliver Sykes, in the journal Space and Polity, put forward that the poster, alongside other posters at the time including Vote Leave's 'Countries set to join the EU' and 'What the EU “tourist deal” means' posters, \"construct[ed] a spatial imaginary of the openness of the UK to 'others' from 'other places', and notably 'openness to the East'.\" Henk van Houtum and Rodrigo Bueno Lacy argued in Fennia that, by \"contextual association\" with the 2015 European migrant crisis, the poster \"promote[d] anxiety\" about immigrants, specifically \"asylum seekers from Muslim-majority countries.\"\nAndrew Reid in Ethical Theory and Moral Practice concluded that the poster warranted a non-criminal sanction from institutions like the Electoral Commission, unlike the bus decal by the Leave campaign which promised \"£350 million\" for the NHS, because \"it belongs to a category of hateful speech that propagates false and discriminatory beliefs about its targets\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Styphelia subulata is a species of flowering plant in the heath family Ericaceae and is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It is a rigid shrub with many branches, usually sharply-pointed, linear leaves and usually one or two white, tube-shaped flowers in leaf axils.\n\n\n== Description ==\nStyphelia subulata is a rigid, scrubby shrub that typically grows to a height of about 60 cm (24 in), and has many branches. The leaves are usually linear, 6.5–8.6 mm (0.26–0.34 in) long, the edges rolled under, and sharply pointed. The flowers are usually arranged singly or in pairs in leaf axils on a very short peduncle, with very small bracts and bracteoles less than half the length of the sepals. The sepals are about 2 mm (0.079 in) long, the petals white and joined at the base to form a tube about the same length as the sepals, with lobes longer than the petal tube.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThis species was first formally described in 1864 by Ferdinand von Mueller who gave it the name Leucopogon subulatus in his Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae, from specimens collected near the Great Australian Bight by George Maxwell. In 2020, Michael Hislop, Darren Crayn and Caroline Puente-Lelievre transferred the species to Styphelia as S. subulata in Australian Systematic Botany. The specific epithet (subulata) means \"awl-shaped\".\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nStyphelia subulata is found in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Esperance Plains and Mallee bioregions of south-western Western Australia.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Isaac L. Rice Mansion (also the Isaac L. Rice House, Villa Julia, and the Solomon Schinasi House) is a mansion at 346 West   and Riverside Drive on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York City. It was designed by Herts & Tallant and built between 1901 and 1903 for the family of the businessman Isaac Rice.  Several further expansions in the 20th century, designed by C. P. H. Gilbert, Bloch & Hesse, and William Lazinsk, are similar in style to the original building. The Rice Mansion has served as a yeshiva, or Jewish school, since 1954 and is one of only two free-standing mansions extant on Riverside Drive. The house is a New York City designated landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nThe mansion was designed in a mixture of the Colonial Revival, Italianate, Georgian, and Beaux-Arts architectural styles. The facade is made of brick and marble and is four stories high, with an attic and basement; it is surrounded by a marble perimeter wall. There is a double-height entrance arch along Riverside Drive. On 89th Street, the first two stories are curved outward and contain a porte-cochère and a carved bas relief panel. The building is topped by a hip roof, clad with Spanish tile. The mansion's interior was decorated in classical architectural styles, and was intentionally designed to be soundproof. It was built with spaces such as a main hall, library, and dining room on the main floor; a chess room in the basement; and bedrooms on the upper stories. Although various subsequent tenants have modified the interior spaces over the years, the house largely retains its original interior layout.\nAt the end of the 19th century, Isaac Rice and his wife Julia sought to erect a residence in a quiet part of New York City. The Rices bought the site at Riverside Drive and 89th Street in 1900 and hired Herts and Tallant to design a house there. The Rice family decided to move to the Ansonia Hotel in 1907 and sold it to the tobacconist Solomon Schinasi, whose family modified the house in 1908, 1912, and 1927. The Schinasi family lived there until around 1945, after which the Heckscher Foundation for Children leased it. Yeshiva Chofetz Chaim acquired the house in 1954. The yeshiva attempted to sell and demolish the mansion in the late 1970s, prompting a heated dispute with local preservationists. The house was taken over in 1988 by another Jewish day school, Yeshiva Ketana, which restored the house in the 1990s. There has been architectural commentary of the house over the years.\n\n\n== Site ==\nThe Isaac L. Rice Mansion is at 346 West  , at the southeast corner with Riverside Drive, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York City. The house occupies an irregular plot with frontage of 148 feet (45 m) wide on 89th Street to the north and 116 feet (35 m) on Riverside Drive to the west; the plot extends 100 feet (30 m) back from 89th Street. The house itself is rectangular, measuring roughly 62 by 38 feet (19 by 12 m), with a semicircular annex to the south and a rectangular annex to the southeast. It is aligned with the rest of the Manhattan street grid (parallel to 89th Street and neighboring buildings), toward the eastern portion of the site. When the house was finished in the early 1900s, the rest of the grounds were originally composed of terraced gardens.\nThe house was originally surrounded by a brick wall designed by Herts & Tallant, who had also designed the rest of the mansion. The wall was described as a solid masonry structure measuring 7 feet (2.1 m) high, interspersed with six pillars measuring 15 feet (4.6 m) high. The brick perimeter wall was demolished in 1912 because it protruded past the lot line, and it was replaced by a marble wall designed by C. P. H. Gilbert. The house is across from the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument within Riverside Park to the west. Rice had specifically selected the site of his house because it faced the monument, and the mansion's marble perimeter wall is designed in a similar style to the monument's balustrades. The Rice Mansion is also near the Normandy apartment building, which is two blocks to the south.\nThe house was one of several freestanding mansions that were built along Riverside Drive and Park in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, at a time when developers envisioned Riverside Drive as a rival to the millionaires' row on Fifth Avenue. The plot immediately to the south was owned by the brewer George Ehret and the department store retailer Benjamin Altman in the late 19th century, neither of whom built their houses there. Immediately to the north was a house belonging to Elizabeth Clark (whose family owned the Dakota apartment building). As part of an agreement that Altman made with William W. Hall in 1898, the Rice Mansion site was restricted to single-family residential use and could not be more than four stories high. By the early 21st century, the Rice Mansion was one of two remaining freestanding mansions on Riverside Drive, along with the Schinasi Mansion. The Rice Mansion was also the only mansion on the avenue that retained some of its original gardens; the other mansions had mostly been replaced with apartment buildings.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe Isaac L. Rice Mansion was designed for the businessman and lawyer Isaac L. Rice by Herts & Tallant, who were known for designing Broadway theaters such as the New Amsterdam, Liberty, and Lyceum. The mansion was designed in a mixture of the Colonial Revival, Italianate, and Georgian styles, and it also incorporates Beaux-Arts architectural elements. Early-20th-century sources also described the house as being patterned after an Italian villa or a Swiss chalet. C. P. H. Gilbert designed an annex in 1908 and a marble perimeter wall in 1912, while Bloch & Hesse and William Lazinsk were responsible for additional annexes in 1927. All of these additions were designed in a similar style to Herts & Tallant's original mansion.\n\n\n=== Facade ===\nThe facade is made of brick and marble and is four stories high, with an attic and basement. The use of brick in the facade is common among neo-Georgian buildings of the time, whereas the marble details were intended to be reminiscent of the Beaux-Arts style. Marble was used for the stairs, gardens, terraces, and archway.\n\n\n==== Riverside Drive ====\n\nThe primary elevation of the mansion's facade faces west toward Riverside Drive and is divided vertically into three bays. There is an entrance on the second story of the Riverside Drive elevation, accessed via a wide exterior stairway. A source from the house's construction described the stairway as measuring 40 feet (12 m) wide. The original plans called for twenty granite steps, with a stone balustrade and electric lamps on either side, but the staircase as built has ten steps. The stairway to the house was narrowed in 1912 when the balustrade around the mansion was rebuilt.\nThe Riverside Drive entrance is a double-height arch, which rises to the third story. The archway is similar to the New Amsterdam Theatre's original archway, which the firm also designed. The lower portion of the arch is flanked by a pair of engaged columns in the Tuscan order. Within the arch, the walls are faced in marble. The arch has a second-story doorway topped by a pediment and a double window. The upper portion of the arch is outlined by a string course with modillions. A keystone shaped like a console bracket is placed at the very top of the arch. On either side of the arched doorway, the second story forms a piano nobile flanked by Tuscan or Doric engaged columns. Miniature balustrades with stone panels are placed in front of the entrance. Above the story is an entablature with modillions, which is interrupted by the archway. The third-story windows have flat lintels influenced by English architecture. String courses run horizontally across the facade at the third and fourth stories as well.\n\n\n==== Other elevations ====\n\nOn 89th Street, the first two stories are curved outward from the rest of the building and are clad with marble. At ground level, there is a porte-cochère for vehicles, which is composed of two segmental arches leading to a ground-floor entrance. Each arch is topped by a keystone. Between the arches of the porte-cochère is a carved bas relief panel depicting six children, who might represent the Rices' sons and daughters. The sculpture is attributed to Louis St. Lannes (or Lanne), who also designed a statue outside the Rice Memorial Stadium in Pelham Bay Park. The second story consists of windows with Doric engaged columns on either side, above which is an entablature with modillions. There is another porte-cochère on 89th Street, which is attached to the house; the one-story structure fits two cars and was designed by Bloch and Hesse in 1927.\nThe rest of the original facade is made of brick and is topped by a cornice with modillions and escutcheons. A hip roof, clad with Spanish tile, overhangs the cornice. The north side of the roof has a skylight. The western and eastern sides of the roof each have three dormer windows that illuminate the attic, while the southern side has a single dormer. The house was originally constructed with four chimneys, two each to the west and east. There is also a brick elevator shaft to the east.\nAt the southeast corner is a two-story annex designed by Gilbert in 1908. This annex is attached to the original mansion's eastern wall, which has very little ornamentation. Gilbert also added a semicircular bay to the southern elevation, similar to the design of the original mansion. The semicircular bay contains windows flanked by Doric engaged columns, as well as an entablature above the second story. The southern elevation additionally includes a two-story arched entrance, which is similar to the design of the Riverside Drive arch. The southern arch is topped by a keystone, and there are three windows above the arch.\n\n\n=== Interior ===\nIsaac Rice and his wife Julia Barnett Rice had wanted the house to be soundproof because their six children (Muriel, Dorothy, Isaac Leopold Jr., Marion, Marjorie, and Julian) made much noise. The mansion's interior was decorated in classical architectural styles, with marble fireplaces, wooden ceilings, stained glass windows, and a marble staircase. Although various subsequent tenants have modified the interior spaces over the years, the house largely retained its original interior layout in the late 20th century. Many of the original fireplace mantels also remain in place, along with wood paneling. The mechanical and electrical systems have also been upgraded. The original house had one elevator, and a second elevator was constructed in 1927.\nThe main hall measures 35 by 35 feet (11 by 11 m). Its ceiling is made of plaster and is divided into coffers with rinceaux and foliate motifs. On the northern and southern walls of the main hall are tall doorways with moldings and pilasters, which originally led to rooms. The room to the north was the library, whose eastern wall contains an elaborate fireplace mantel. The library's mantel is flanked by pilasters with ornate capitals, which support a shelf with carved rinceaux and a central medallion. The library had a carving of a blind beggar by Dorothy Rice, which was reportedly sculpted using only a hairpin, as well as a bronze bust of a rabbi also designed by Dorothy. South of the main hall was the dining room, which has wood paneling transported from the St. Louis World's Fair. One source from 1907 described it as \"one of the handsomest rooms in the house\", with 40 types of wood used in the ceiling and walls.\nIn the basement, there was a chess room where Isaac Rice often arranged matches with overseas competitors. Designed in the Arts and Crafts style, the chess room was a double-height space measuring 22 by 22 feet (6.7 by 6.7 m), with space for six tables. The room had a ventilation system, and it was soundproofed so Isaac could concentrate during matches. Other features of the house included wine vaults, billiards rooms, a fitness room, a studio, an infirmary room, and a garage that could fit several vehicles. The fourth floor contained a gymnasium for the Rice children.\nThe house's original staircase was made of wood; this was replaced in 1908 by an iron-and-marble stairway, designed by Gilbert in the Italianate style. The lower part of the staircase has a marble balustrade with coats of arms and rosettes. On the upper stories, the staircase has an iron balustrade with rosettes, as well as landings with protruding balconies. The upper stories were used as bedrooms. Each of the Rice children designed their bedrooms according to their own tastes; for example, Isaac Jr. and Julian decorated their respective room with machinery. On the fourth floor, there is a room  with a plaster ceiling that contains moldings, a frieze, and geometric motifs.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Use as residence ===\nAt the end of the 19th century, Isaac and Julia sought to erect a residence in a quiet part of New York City, away from Broadway. The Rices initially obtained a 75-by-100-foot (23 by 30 m) site at 88th Street and Riverside Drive from Egbert Viele, paying $125,000 for that site in June 1899. Isaac Rice was reportedly convinced to buy the neighboring plot to the north. at 89th Street, while observing a parade from the roof of Viele's house. In October, the Rices bought the site to the north for $225,000 or $235,000. As partial compensation, Isaac Rice relinquished ownership of the 88th Street site. Rice planned to spend $200,000 to erect the residence on 89th Street. The Real Estate Record and Guide predicted that the mansion would be \"another handsome dwelling in an avenue which, during the year, has sprung into architectural and social fame\".\n\n\n==== Rice ownership ====\n\nHerts and Tallant submitted blueprints for a four-to-five-story brick-and-stone mansion to the New York City Department of Buildings in August 1900. The original plans called for the mansion to occupy the center of its site. There were to be features such as a garage, gymnasium, chess room, grand stair, observatory tower, billiard room, and private clinic. The Building & Sanitary Inspection Company was given the contract for the plumbing and ventilation. Herts & Tallant submitted updated plans for the mansion in August 1901; the house was relocated eastward, allowing a grand entrance on Riverside Drive while complementing the adjoining row houses on 89th Street. The structure was built up to the third story by January 1902. By the end of the year, the house was nearly complete. Its final cost was estimated at $750,000, not including furniture. The Rices' perimeter fence protruded several feet onto the sidewalk along both Riverside Drive and 89th Street, though Rice had obtained the city government's permission to erect the fence.\nWhen the house was completed, Rice called it \"Villa Julia\" after his wife. He sometimes hosted chess matches at the house, such as college tournaments and at least one international collegiate match conducted by cablegram. Isaac Rice rehired Herts & Tallant in 1906 to design a one-story annex at a cost of $25,000. By the mid-1900s, Julia Rice had become annoyed that tugboats on the Hudson River (near the house) made frequent noises, saying the noise made it impossible for Riverside Drive residents to sleep. After a student counted almost 3,000 horn blasts near the house in a single night, Julia established the Society for the Suppression of Unnecessary Noise at the house in early 1907. Tugboat operators protested outside her house, but the effort ultimately led to federal legislation limiting noise from tugboats. The city government sought to have the mansion's perimeter wall removed by mid-1906, after government officials received complaints from several neighbors. Though Rice argued that other Riverside Drive residences had taller fences, he was ordered to demolish his perimeter wall in January 1907; litigation over the wall continued for months.\n\n\n==== Schinasi ownership ====\nIn 1907, the Rice family decided to move to the Ansonia Hotel. Various reasons are given for the relocation, including that year's financial crisis, the fact that the Rices spent much of their time elsewhere, and Julia Rice's fight against tugboat noise. Julia herself cited noise from the tugboats, and from the New York Central Railroad's West Side Line, as the reason for her decision to move to the Ansonia. The tobacconist Solomon Schinasi, whose brother Morris was developing the Schinasi Mansion further north, bought the Rice Mansion in December 1907 for $600,000. He paid cash for the home and also took over the house's $175,000 mortgage. Schinasi had reportedly not even considered buying the Rice Mansion until shortly before his purchase was finalized. A judge ruled the same month that the mansion's perimeter wall had to be removed.\nIn April 1908, C. P. H. Gilbert submitted plans to the New York City Department of Buildings for the construction of a three-story extension, which was to cost $38,000. The work involved removing the main stairway and elevator to make way for a new entrance. The W. L. Crow Construction Company was hired as the general contractor for the annex's construction, while D. S. Hess & Co. was given the contract for the interior decorations. Meanwhile, the city's park commissioner initially refrained from demolishing the Rice Mansion's perimeter wall, as he was awaiting the outcome of another lawsuit involving the removal of sidewalk obstructions. The second lawsuit was decided in the park commissioner's favor in June 1911, and the wall was demolished starting the next month. Schinasi hired Gilbert in 1912 to design a new perimeter wall, and Bunn and Nase were hired to build the wall. Solomon, his son Leon, and his adoptive daughter Nellie Schrater Stoeve lived there. Nellie described herself as being \"as much a domestic slave of the Schinasi family as though I had really been a prisoner\" while at the mansion.\nSolomon Schinasi lived in the house until 1919, when he died there of heart disease. Leon and Nellie continued to live there. Leon married Ruby Smith Salmon in 1926, and Ruby is recorded as having moved to the house; she also kicked Nellie out. The next year, Leon developed a garage on 89th Street and modified the southern facade of the house. Upon Leon's death in 1930, he bequeathed the house and the objects inside to Ruby, who continued to live there with their two children. By 1935, the general costs of the mansion amounted to $35,000 annually. In 1940, a New York Surrogate's Court judge authorized Ruby to spend $2,000 to redecorate her daughter's bedroom inside the house.\nThe Schinasi family continued to live in the house until around 1945, and it leased the house out during the mid-20th century. The Heckscher Foundation for Children leased the house in the mid-1940s. A New York Times article from 1946 described the house as hosting rehearsals twice a week, in addition to dance rehearsals and \"other forms of welfare work\".\n\n\n=== Use as yeshiva ===\n\n\n==== Yeshiva Chofetz Chaim ownership ====\n\nYeshiva Chofetz Chaim, a yeshiva (traditional Jewish school) for Orthodox Jewish students, acquired the house in June 1954 at an assessed price of $300,000. The yeshiva had originally been the Radin Yeshiva, which had relocated from Poland after World War II. Chofetz Chaim had moved into the house by the end of the year, using the mansion as a school while retaining the house's original decorations. The yeshiva opened a high school in Tallman, New York, in 1964 but kept ownership of the house at 346 West 89th Street. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) considered designating the house as a landmark in 1973 but ultimately declined to do so.\nIn 1979, Yeshiva Chofetz Chaim indicated that it wanted to sell the Rice Mansion because it was too small for the school and too expensive to maintain. The yeshiva's dean, Emerich Feigelstock, said the school needed money and that a developer might offer $1.5 million to $2.5 million. The developer, rumored to be a Canadian firm, would have replaced the mansion with a high-rise tower with up to 40 apartments, as well as classrooms for the yeshiva. Local residents formed the Citizens' Coalition to Preserve the Isaac L. Rice Mansion. The group and the yeshiva could not agree on a potential buyer for the mansion or an alternate location for the school. Feigelstock said in September 1979 that he had identified a developer who was willing to pay $2 million, whereas a buyer selected by Citizens' Coalition wanted to pay only $250,000. The LPC held a hearing on the mansion that month, amid continuing disputes over the mansion. Feigelstock maintained that the building had no historical or architectural importance because Rice was unknown to him. The LPC designated the Rice Mansion as a landmark in February 1980.\nThe LPC's designation had to be approved by the New York City Board of Estimate, and Jewish groups and local residents continued to debate it acrimoniously. One New York Times article that the discussions were marked by \"suggestions of anti-Semitism and allusions to connections with figures in nursing-home scandals\". Opponents of the designation believed that a decision over the building's preservation was outside the LPC's purview, while supporters did not want the house to be demolished. New York Times architectural critic Paul Goldberger said the residents' reasons for saving the mansion were inherently selfish in nature. By a margin of one vote, the Board of Estimate confirmed the house's landmark designation in June 1980. The building was also placed on the New York State Register of Historic Places and the National Register of Historic Places, and the offer to buy the mansion was withdrawn. The LPC designation meant that, if the yeshiva had difficulties financing the building's maintenance, the city had to find a new owner for the mansion, and demolition was more difficult. In 1987, the LPC proposed including the house in the planned Riverside-West End Historic District, which was designated as a city historic district three years later.\n\n\n==== Yeshiva Ketana ownership ====\n\nThe house was taken over in 1988 by another Jewish day school, Yeshiva Ketana, which had 200 students. Yeshiva Ketana was one of several Orthodox Jewish day schools in the neighborhood. The yeshiva began raising money for repairs to the Rice Mansion, including a $250,000 renovation of the roof, which was partly funded by a private grant. The school had difficulty raising money for other repairs, including the construction of a second staircase to four rooms on the roof, so it asked the local preservation group Landmark West for assistance. Yeshiva Ketana replaced the mansion's roof in the late 1990s. The roof caught fire in December 1997, shortly after its renovation was completed; though the upper stories were severely damaged, repairs to the roof were delayed until the end of the school year. Because the house was a designated city landmark, the New York Landmarks Conservancy and other local groups provided funding to restore the damaged roof.\nIn 1999, Yeshiva Ketana proposed converting the house's dust-filled yard into a playground, but local residents opposed the plan. By the early 21st century, local residents accused Yeshiva Ketana of not adequately maintaining the house and complained to both the LPC and the New York City Department of Buildings, the latter of which fined the yeshiva. The house was still known as the Rice Mansion or the Rice House. The New York Times described the house in 2005 as dilapidated, with cracks in the masonry; damaged or missing copper decorations; and a yard filled with dust that blew into nearby houses. Yeshiva Ketana continued to occupy the building in the 2020s.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nUpon the house's completion, the Democrat and Chronicle called the house \"one of the finest houses in New York, both in its exterior aspect and its interior arrangement\". When the building was designated as a landmark in 1980, Paul Goldberger wrote that the Rice Mansion was \"a handsome freestanding mansion, mixing the beaux arts and neo-Georgian styles in the eclectic manner\", in a manner akin to the Andrew Carnegie Mansion on the Upper East Side. Goldberger also wrote that the house was \"at once grand and pleasantly eccentric\", especially considering the design of its porte-cochere. A writer for the SoHo News write that the house's Riverside Drive facade augmented the avenue because it faced the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, while the 89th Street elevation inspired the design of the adjacent row houses. Christopher Gray, another architectural historian, said the house was \"superior to many\" existing city-designated landmarks.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan from 59th to 110th Streets\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Manhattan from 59th to 110th Streets\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\nIsaac L.

Přísaha earned just 51 local councilors out of 61 796 possible. In the hometown of the Přísaha's leader Robert Šlachta, Pohořelice, the party was able to gain 41.28% of the vote and near majority with 9 out of 21 seats. It was however left short of power as every other party in Pohořelice formed a unity coalition against Přísaha.\nMotorists for Themselves hoped to become part of the Prague governing coalition, but they failed to overcome the 5% electoral threshold and did not gain any seats in the Prague City Council.\nIn the autumn of 2023, both parties have announced their intention to support each other in the upcoming 2024 Czech Senate election, and the Motorists vowed to support Šlachta's attempts to win a seat in the Senate.\nAround the same time, Přísaha announced its intention to run in the European election, with the leader of its South Bohemian chapter as its probable lead candidate. Meanwhile, Motorists were in negotiations with Svobodní about a joint list for the elections. However, in the January 2024, both parties have signed a memorandum and announced a coalition for the European elections. The formation hopes to gain at least two seats and it announced a planed budget of six milion Czech crowns or about two hundred and fifty thousand Euros as their electoral budget.\n\n\n== Member parties ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Brompton did not have its own place of worship until 1838, when a chapel of ease was constructed.  Half of the building was partitioned off as a schoolroom until 1872, when a new school was built behind the church.  The church was grade II listed in 1969.  It was reordered in the 1990s, with the pews replaced by moveable seats.\nIt church is built of stone with a Welsh slate roof, and consists of a two-bay nave with a north porch, and a higher two-bay chancel with a south vestry.  On the west gable is a bellcote with Baroque-style coping.  The windows in the nave and the east window have Perpendicular tracery, while the other windows in the chancel have Y-tracery.\n\n\n== See also ==\nListed buildings in Brompton-on-Swale\n\n\n== References ==",

Centered around the intersections of Forest Avenue (part of U.S. Route 302 and State Route 100), Allen Avenue (SR 100) and Stevens Avenue. It was once home to some of the oldest families in what was the city of Deering.\nThe Kennebec and Portland Railroad was laid through the neighborhood in 1847. It was abandoned in 1911. The Boston and Maine Railroad also ran through Deering Junction. From 1914 to 1933, the Portland–Lewiston Interurban entered Portland via the Portland Railroad line from Morrills Corner.\nMorrills Corner is named for brother Rufus and Levi Morrill, who lived there in the early 1800s.

Equally adept on both dirt and asphalt surfaces, officials have estimated that he captured over 400 feature wins in a career that spanned three decades.\n\n\n== Racing career ==\nSammy Reakes was introduced to racing by his cousin Ed Spencer, father of NASCAR Cup Series standout Jimmy Spencer, at Bowman's  Creek Speedway PA.  In 1953 Reakes relocated to Central New York, and became a regular at Fulton Speedway, Lafayette Speedway, and Rolling Wheels Raceway (Elbridge).  He captured track championships at Brewerton Speedway, Canandaigua Speedway, Maple Grove Speedway (Waterloo), Monroe County Fairgrounds, Orange County Fair Speedway, and Weedsport Speedway.\nA job transfer required relocating to northern Illinois, where Reakes won the Late Model Sportsman championship at Rockville Speedway in 1973, and captured the state championship a year later.  He was inducted into the Northeast Dirt Modified Hall of Fame in 1994, and his wife Zelda received the Hall's 2008 Outstanding Women in Auto Racing award for her behind the scenes support.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sarah C. Hall (1832–1926) was an American pioneer woman physician. She held leadership positions in various women's suffrage organizations, and was also associated with the Order of the Eastern Star, Woman's Relief Corps (WRC), and the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR).\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nSarah C. Larkin was born on a farm in Madison County, New York, on August 15, 1832. Her parents were of mixed English and Irish ancestry. She was collaterally related to Commodore Matthew C. Perry. Her family were Quakers, and she was educated in the society and wore its style of clothing until she was a young woman. \n\n\n== Teacher ==\nAt the age of 16, she began to teach school and boarded round, which she continued to do till her marriage with Earl J. Hall (died 1911), on October 12, 1853. The couple went west from Philadelphia on their wedding tour and stopped at Indianapolis, Indiana. Looking over that city, they liked it and located there, where they remained for 18 years. There, she took a prominent part in organized charity work. She also taught in city schools at times till she took up the study of medicine.\n\n\n== Medical school ==\nHer inclination would have led her to study law, but the influence of her family doctor, J. T. Boyd, who urged upon her the great necessity for women physicians and offered his services as her preceptor, decided her course. Except from him, she received but little encouragement in this choice. Her preparatory studies were made while caring for her two children and doing all her housework and sewing.\nIn 1867, she entered the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania, from which she graduated in 1870. She was one of the class which, in November 1869, was insulted by the male students at the first Pennsylvania hospital clinic to which women were admitted, ignored by the lecturers, and followed and almost mobbed on the streets.\n\n\n== Kansas ==\nOn a trip to Kansas City, Kansas, Mr. Hall heard of the unprecedented growth of Fort Scott, Kansas. They moved to Fort Scott in the latter part of 1870. She was one of the very first regularly qualified women physicians to practice in Kansas. She eventually became a member of the County Medical Society, chiefly to give company to a young woman doctor, who had just begun practice in the city and wished to join the society. Hall was also a member of the State Medical Society and the American Medical Association. She held the position of medical examiner to several insurance orders.\nAlthough necessarily making her profession her chief task, Hall was a charter member of the Order of the Eastern Star and an active member of the WRC, holding high offices in both organizations. She was also a charter member of the Mollie Foster Berry Chapter of the DAR. The chapter was named for her ancestor, and her daughter, Miss Frances Hall, was its first regent.\nHall had a strong interest in women's suffrage. Her attention was first called to the need for its public recognition when she received US$8 a month and board for teaching at the same school for which a man had the season before received US$24 a month and board, although the whole district declared her work to be better than his. Later and wider experience deepened her conviction. She attended many of the early suffrage conventions, both national and local. After moving to Kansas she was at first identified with suffrage work only in her city, but during the campaign for municipal suffrage, in 1886 and 1887, she came prominently forward in the State councils, and she seldom since lost an opportunity to aid wherever possible. Several times, she served on the executive committee of the National Woman Suffrage Association and the National American Woman Suffrage Association, holding the position of Honorary Vice President for Kansas in the latter organization. She was also the President of the Bourbon County, Kansas Equal Suffrage Association.\nIn 1888, she was elected to serve a three-year term on the Fort Scott school board.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nHall was the mother of two children, Clarence and Frances.\nShe helped found the Unitarian Society at Fort Scott.\nWidowed in 1911, Hall sold the family home and with her daughter, Frances, moved to Elgin, Illinois. Dr. Hall died in Elgin, May 30, 1926, age 93. Burial was at the Evergreen cemetery, Fort Scott.\nAn oil painting of Hall by H. W. Cuthbertson is held by the National Portrait Gallery.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Works related to Woman of the Century/Sarah C. Hall at Wikisource",

        "content": "On September 2, 2020, jihadists from Islamic State – West Africa Province (ISWAP) ambushed Nigerian soldiers near the village of Garin Giwa, Kukawa, Borno State, Nigeria.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 2016, Boko Haram leadership deposed longtime leader Abubakar Shekau and appointed Abu Musab al-Barnawi as the head of the group. Barnawi pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, and reformed the group into Islamic State – West Africa Province (ISWAP) while Shekau created his own splinter faction of Boko Haram. On the day prior to the ambush in Garin Giwa, ten soldiers were killed during a routine patrol in Magumeri, in Nigeria's Borno State, by al-Barnawi's faction of ISWAP.\n\n\n== Ambush ==\nThe ambush in Garin Giwa was carried out by Umar Lene, a prominent ISWAP commander, and two sub-commanders while Nigerian soldiers were on patrol in Garin Giwa's town center. Fighting broke out between the surprised Nigerian troops and the jihadists, and lasted for thirty minutes before ISWAP fighters fled on two seized pick-up trucks. Ten Nigerian special forces soldiers were killed immediately in the attack, and several soldiers were missing. Five wounded soldiers were brought to Mile 4, where Nigerian soldiers had control of the area, and Nigerian army sources claimed other soldiers were injured. The bodies of the slain soldiers were taken to Maiduguri.\nThe al-Barnawi faction of ISWAP claimed responsibility for the ambush at Garin Giwa that same day.\n\n\n== References ==",

Then he began to teach at Atatürk University and was promoted to associated professor of biostatistics on 29 November 1962. He served as the chair of the Zootechnics Department at Ankara University between 18 March 1965 and 30 June 1966 and became a full professor on 30 June 1966. Then he worked as the dean of the Faculty of Science and Literature and the Faculty of Agriculture at Atatürk University. \nKarataş was appointed director general of the TRT in January 1976 replacing Nevzat Yalçıntaş in the post. Karataş's tenure ended on 22 June 1977 when the Council of State annulled his appointment as a result of Bülent Ecevit's complaint against him and the TRT. His successor in the post was Cengiz Taşer.\nKarataş was elected as a member of the Parliament in the 1979 by-election for the Justice Party representing Konya. His tenure was very brief due to the military coup on 12 September 1980. Following the coup Karataş was among the Justice Party members whose political activities were banned by the military rule.\nAfter his ban was lifted in 1987 Karataş served as the head of the Ankara branch of the Intellectuals' Hearth. He became a member of the Parliament in the 1995 general election for the Welfare Party from Ankara. He joined the Nationalist Movement Party when the Welfare Party was banned in January 1998. Karataş's tenure at the Parliament ended in 1999 when he did not win his seat from Konya in the general election. \nKarataş was also a member of the Middle East Technical University's board of trustees. He was the founding chair of the Bezmialem Vakıf University's board of trustees. \n\n\n=== Work and views ===\nKarataş published a book entitled İstatistiğe Giriş (Turkish: Introduction to Statistics) in 1963. He also published a book on his term at the TRT entitled TRT Kavgası (Turkish: TRT Fight).\nKarataş was respectful for the will of the nation and extremely loyal to the Republic of Turkey, but he was not a Kemalist.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nKarataş was married and had two children. He died in Ankara on 14 February 2016 and was buried in the Gölbaşı cemetery on 16 February.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Kimito Nono (濃野 公人, Nono Kimito, born 26 March 2002) is a Japanese professional footballer who plays as a right back for J1 League club Kashima Antlers.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nNono was born in Ibaraki, Osaka and his father would often take him to watch Gamba Osaka matches. Whilst at elementary school, he moved to Chikushino, Fukuoka and joined Sagan Tosu U-15.\n\n\n== Youth career ==\nDespite playing for Sagan Tosu's U-15 side, Nono decided to attend Otsu High School to continue his footballing journey rather than move up to Tosu's U-18s. At this time, his position was as a forward. In 2019, he scored six goals in 17 appearances in the Prince Takamado Trophy JFA U-18 Football League.\nNono received an offer from Kwansei Gakuin University, which he accepted. In his first year, he moved first to right-midfield, before settling in the right-back position at the start of his second year. From then on, Nono was a regular player for the university team. The team finished as winners of the JUFA Kansai League in both 2021 and 2022. At the end of his time at the university, he had 64 appearances and scored 10 goals.\n\n\n== Club career ==\nNono received two offers from J1 League clubs. In June 2023, it was announced that he would be joining J1 League team Kashima Antlers for the 2024 J1 League season.\nNono made his debut for the club on the opening game of the season in a 3–0 league victory over Nagoya Grampus. He became the first college graduate rookie since 1993 to be named in the starting lineup of the opening game for a Kashima side. In April 2024, he scored his first goal for the club, an 85th-minute winner in a 1–0 league win over Kyoto Sanga.\nIn his first appearance in the J.League Cup, Nono was sent off in extra time in a 2–1 victory over Vanraure Hachinohe.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n=== Club ===\nAs of 18 April 2024\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nProfile at Kashima Antlers\nProfile at jleague.jp",

        "content": "This article covers the history of Ottoman architecture from the 19th century up to the end of the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century. The 19th century saw architectural influences from Western Europe increase, brought in by architects such as those from the Balyan family. The Ottoman Baroque style, which emerged in the 18th century, continued to be evident in the early 19th century under the reigns of Selim III and Mahmud II. Empire style and Neoclassical motifs began to be introduced around this time. Starting especially with the Tanzimat period (1839 and after), a trend towards eclecticism was prominent in many types of buildings, as exemplified by the Dolmabaçe Palace and other mosques of this era designed by the Balyans.\nIn the late 19th century, an Orientalist fashion began mixing neo-Ottoman and other traditional Islamic architectural elements into new buildings, seen in many of the designs by Alexandre Vallaury. Art Nouveau also appeared towards the end of the century, promoted most notably by Raimondo D'Aronco. The last decades of the Ottoman Empire saw the development of a new architectural style that was more rigorously neo-Ottoman and revivalist, often known as the First National Architectural Movement, by architects such as Mimar Kemaleddin and Vedat Tek.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nFollowing the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople (present-day Istanbul) in 1453, Ottoman architecture evolved progressively into what became the classical Ottoman style, which was consolidated in the 16th century under the long tenure of Mimar Sinan as imperial architect. The classical style remained during the 17th century but became less innovative and more repetitive. Cultural shifts in the early 18th century, particularly during the Tulip Period (c. 1718 – c. 1730), triggered a shift away from this style, as the Ottoman ruling class opened itself to Western influence. New decorative trends and new building types became evident in the architecture of this era. \nDuring the 1740s, a new Ottoman or Turkish \"Baroque\" style emerged in its full expression and rapidly grew dominant in imperial architecture. This signaled the final end to the classical style. After the Tulip Period, Ottoman architecture openly imitated European architecture, so that architectural and decorative trends in Europe were mirrored in the Ottoman Empire. Changes were especially evident in the ornamentation of new buildings rather than in their overall forms, though new building types were eventually introduced from European influences as well.\n\n\n== Last Ottoman Baroque monuments (early 19th century) ==\n\nSome of the last clearly Ottoman Baroque monuments to be constructed were those built under Selim III (r. 1789–1807) and Mahmud II (r. 1808–1839). At the end of the 18th century, one of Selim III's major projects was rebuilding the Eyüp Sultan Mosque between 1798 and 1800. Other family members and high state officials built new monuments in the same area around this time, such as Mihrişah Sultan's charitable complex (1792–1796) and the Tomb of Şah Sultan (1800–1801). \n\nIn other trends, Selim III established the monumental barracks as a new and prominent type of building in Istanbul's urban landscape. This took place in conjunction with Selim III's reform attempts, the Nizam-i Cedid (\"New Order\"), which among other things created a new Western-style army. Selim III built a barracks building for his \"New Artillery\" regiment in Tophane, near the later site of the Nusretiye Mosque. This was destroyed by fire in 1823 and rebuilt by Mahmud II in 1824. The Selimiye Barracks was built in southern Üsküdar between 1800 and 1803. It was rebuilt in stone by Mahmud II between 1825 and 1828 and further expanded to its current form by Abdulmecid between 1842 and 1853.\n\nThe construction of the Selimiye Barracks was followed by the construction of the nearby Selimiye Mosque complex between 1801 and 1805. The complex included the usual mosque dependencies, but more innovative was the construction of factories, shops, and modern facilities such as a printing house, all arranged to form the nucleus of a new neighbourhood with a regular grid of streets. The mosque incorporates a wide imperial pavilion (a small lounge or residence for the sultan) that stretches across its front façade, a feature that appeared in the 18th century (e.g. Beylerbeyi Mosque) but which was further refined here. The prayer hall largely retains a traditional single-domed layout.\n\nFrom Mahmud II's time, the Tomb of Nakşidil Sultan (1818) is one of the finest Ottoman Baroque tombs and one of the best examples of late Baroque monuments. It also incorporates some influence from the Empire style, which was being introduced in Istanbul around this time. Some of the Baroque mosques from this period feature elliptical domes, such as the small single-domed Küçük Efendi (or Fevziye) Mosque in Istanbul (1825) and the multi-domed Kapı Mosque in Konya (1812).\n\nThe Nusretiye Mosque, Mahmud II's imperial mosque, was built between 1822 and 1826 at Tophane. This mosque was the first major imperial work by Krikor Balian. It is sometimes described as belonging to the Empire style, but is considered by art historians Godfrey Goodwin and Doğan Kuban as one of the last Ottoman Baroque mosques. Another art historian, Ünver Rüstem, describes the style as moving away from the Baroque and towards an Ottoman interpretation of Neoclassicism. Goodwin also describes it as the last in a line of imperial mosques that started with the Nuruosmaniye (1748–1755). Despite its relatively small size the mosque's tall proportions creates a sense of height, marking the culmination of a trend that likely began with the Ayazma Mosque (1757–1761).\n\n\n== Empire style (early–mid 19th century) ==\nDuring the reign of Mahmud II (r. 1808–1839) the Empire style, a Neoclassical style which originated in France under Napoleon, was also introduced into Ottoman architecture. This marked the trend towards increasingly direct imitation of Western styles, particularly from France. The purest example of the Empire style in Istanbul is the Tomb of Mahmud II (1840), an imposing octagonal monument designed by Ohannes and Bogos Dadyan. Other examples are the Cevri Kalfa School on Divanyolu Street, dated to 1819, and the tomb and library complex of Hüsrev Pasha in the Eyüp neighbourhood, dated to 1839. The upper section of the Tower of Justice or Divan Tower in Topkapı Palace was also rebuilt in its current form under Mahmud II in 1820, adopting Renaissance and Palladian elements. Empire style motifs, such as colonettes and composite capitals, continued to be widely used throughout the 19th century alongside other styles.\n\nThe Hırka-i Şerif Mosque, built between 1847 and 1851 under Abdülmecid I (r. 1839–1861), is a unique religious building in Ottoman architecture which was designed to house the Holy Mantle (Hırka-i Şerif), a relic of the Prophet Muhammad. (Another mantle and relic, the Hırka-i Saadet, is housed in Topkapı Palace.) Because of this special function, the mosque has an unusual design. It was built and decorated in a purely Empire or Neoclassical style. It is fronted by an imperial pavilion with a somber Neoclassical façade and slender minarets that look like Corinthian columns. This section leads to an octagonal mosque lit by large windows, with a mihrab and minbar fashioned of dark grey marble. The sacred relic is kept inside another smaller octagonal building directly behind the mosque.\n\tEmpire style\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Eclecticism (19th century) ==\nThe Tanzimat reforms began in 1839 under Abdülmecid I (r. 1839–1861) and sought to modernize the Ottoman Empire with Western-style reforms. In the architectural realm, this period resulted in the dominance of European architects and of Ottoman architects with European training. Among these, the Balyans, an Ottoman Armenian family, succeeded in dominating imperial architecture for much of the century. They were joined by European architects such as the Fossati brothers, William James Smith, and Alexandre Vallaury. After the early 19th century, Ottoman architecture was characterized by an eclectic architecture that mixed or borrowed from multiple styles. The Balyans, for example, commonly combined Neoclassical or Beaux-arts architecture with highly eclectic decoration. As more Europeans arrived in Istanbul, the neighbourhoods of Galata and Beyoğlu (or Pera) took on very European appearances.\n\n\n=== Palaces ===\n\n\n==== Dolmabahçe Palace ====\n\nThe Dolmabahçe Palace was constructed for Sultan Abdülmecid between June 13, 1843, and June 7, 1856. Construction was finished by 1853 or 1854, but the sultan did not move into the palace until 1856. It replaced the Topkapı Palace as the official imperial residence of the sultan. It was built on a site along the Bosphorus that had been previously occupied by the old Beşiktaş Palace and its gardens, which had been used and expanded by various sultans since the 17th century until its demolition to make room for the current palace. Dolmabahçe Palace was designed by Garabet Balyan, though his son Nikogos was known to collaborate with him and may have designed the Ceremonial Hall and the palace gates. The palace consists mainly of a single building with monumental proportions. These characteristics represented a radical rejection of traditional Ottoman palace design. \n\nThe style of the palace is fundamentally Neoclassical but is characterized by a highly eclectic decoration that mixes Baroque motifs with other styles. The monumental gates that lead to the palace grounds are especially ornate and distinguished by highly sculptural and eclectic decoration in stone, marble, and plaster. The decoration of the palace goes beyond the usual eclecticism seen in contemporary Western architecture, as it mixes multiple different styles in the same building. It lacks some consistency and unity as a result. Aside from the European-inspired design, the organization of the palace still reflected a traditional Ottoman division between the selamlık (official section), which occupies the southwestern wing of the palace, and the harem (private section), which occupies the northeastern wing. The two wings of the palace are separated by the Ceremonial Hall, a grand domed hall. The different sections of the palace are also centred around cruciform halls, another feature retained from the Ottoman tradition.\n\tDolmabahçe Palace (1843–1856)\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Other residences and pavilions ====\nMany other palaces, residences, and pleasure pavilions were built in the 19th century, most of them in the Bosphorus suburbs of Istanbul. The small single-story Ihlamur Pavilion, built in 1849–1855, and the slightly larger two-story Küçüksu Pavilion, built in 1856, were both designed by Nikogos Balyan and feature very ornate façades. They were originally used as recreational pavilions or resting areas and did not contain bedrooms, though bedrooms were later added to the Küçüksu Pavilion when it was used to house foreign dignitaries. The Mecidiye Kiosk in the Fourth Court of Topkapı Palace is another small single-story structure in a similar style, designed by Sarkis Balyan and built in 1840. \nThe Beylerbeyi Palace, along the shore of the Bosphorus, was designed by Sarkis Balyan and his brother Agop Balyan in a Neoclassical style with eclectic and Orientalist interior decoration. It was completed in 1864–1865 and replaced an earlier structure by Krikor Balyan from the reign of Mahmud II. The palace was used as the sultan's summer residence and as a guest residence for foreign dignitaries. Like Dolmabahçe Palace, its interior is divided into selamlık and harem sections separated by a large central hall. \nSoon after this, the Çırağan Palace was commissioned by Sultan Abdülalziz (r. 1861–1876) and completed in 1872. Nikogos or Sarkis Balyan was probably responsible for the design. It has a severe Neoclassical appearance except for the decoration, which is Orientalist and includes carved openwork in the windows. The palace was destroyed by fire in 1910, leaving only the seaside façade standing which was later integrated into a hotel in 1987.\n\n\tOther 19th-century palaces\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Yıldız Palace ====\n\nOne of the last major Ottoman imperial creations was the Yıldız Palace, a sprawling complex of buildings set amidst a large wooded park (Yıldız Park) on a hillside overlooking the Bosphorus. The area had been a private garden of the sultans since the 17th century and was known as the Çırağan garden during the Tulip Period. Selim III, Mahmud II, Abdülmecid and Abdülaziz each erected various pavilions here, but it was Abdülhamid II (r. 1876–1909) who transformed it into an imperial palace, residence, and seat of government. After the massive single-block palace buildings like Dolmabahçe, the Yildiz Palace returned to the older tradition of creating many different structures with no overarching site plan. Unlike Topkapı Palace though, the structures are not linked together around courtyards and they instead resemble a kind of rural mountain village. Moreover, the palace and inner gardens were separated from the adjacent wooded park which was open to the public. One part of the palace complex formed its own private harem section. The most imposing structure in the center of the palace is the Büyük Mabeyn Köşk erected by Abdülaziz and designed by Agop and Sarkis Balyan. It has a traditional divanhane layout typical of earlier Ottoman pavilions and a Neoclassical design with Orientalist decoration similar to the contemporary Çırağan Palace.\nThe many subsequent buildings built under Abdülhamid II are less monumental and many of them were designed by Raimond D'Aronco in an Art Nouveau style. One of the largest and most interesting is the Şale or Chalet Pavilion, so-called because it was built to resemble a Swiss mountain chalet in the Alps. The palace complex also included a theatre, a greenhouse, stables, and an official mosque, the Hamidiye Mosque. Several other pavilions stand in the park outside the private palace enclosure such as the Malta Kiosk and the Çadır Kiosk, both designed by the Balyans under Sultan Abdülaziz. The mosque, designed by Sarkis Balyan for Abdülhamid II and dated to 1886, has no resemblance at all to the traditional form of Ottoman mosques and looks more like a church. It is decorated with neo-Gothic and Orientalist details, some of which recall the decoration of the earlier Çırağan Palace and the Pertevniyal Valide Mosque (discussed below).\n\n\tYıldız Palace complex\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Mosques ===\n\nAfter the Nusretiye Mosque, one of the earliest mosques designed by the Balyan family is the Küçuk Mecidiye Mosque in Istanbul, near Yıldız, which was built in 1848. At the same time as the Dolmabahçe Palace was being built, Garabet and Nikogos Balyan also built the nearby Dolmabahçe Mosque, commissioned by Bezmi'alem Valide Sultan in 1853 but finished after her death by her son Abdülmecid in 1855. The mosque is Neoclassical in style and distinguished by its minarets which are shaped like Corinthian columns up to their balcony levels. It is a single-domed building fronted by a large and imposing imperial pavilion. The mosque's upper windows are arranged in a semi-circular wheel-like design under the arches that support the dome.\nThe Ortaköy Mosque (or Büyük Mecidiye Mosque), located further northeast on a small promontory along the Bosphorus shore, has a very similar design that is considered more successful. The mosque was once again designed by Garabet Balyan and his son Nikogos and was built between 1854 and 1856 – although Goodwin and Kuban cite the year of construction as 1853. The Balyans likely worked as a team in order to produce so many works in such a short period. The mosque has a Baroque appearance in its use of strong curves but it features an eclectic mix of styles, except for the imperial pavilion in front which is entirely Neoclassical. The mosque is covered in highly ornate and sculptural details that recall the style of the Ceremonial Hall and gates of the Dolmabahçe Palace.\n\nThe Pertevniyal Valide Mosque in Istanbul was built in the Aksaray neighbourhood of Istanbul in 1871 in honour of Abdülaziz's mother. It is usually attributed to the Italian architect Montani Efendi or to Agop Balyan, although it's possible that both were responsible for different aspects of the design. The mosque is an intense mix of styles including Ottoman, Gothic, and Empire styles. One notable change from previous mosques is the decrease in the imperial pavilion's size relative to the mosque, reversing the previous trend of the 18th-19th centuries. The use of Ottoman revival features in this mosque is also an indication that the foundations for a future Ottoman revivalist movement were already being laid at this time. Another eclectic-style mosque of the same period is the Aziziye Mosque in Konya, built in 1872. This is the only imperial mosque built in Anatolia during the late Ottoman period.\n\tMosques in eclectic styles\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Churches and synagogues ===\nThe Tanzimat reforms also granted Christians and Jews the right to freely build new centers of worship, which resulted in the significant construction, renovation, and expansion of churches and synagogues. Most of these new constructions followed the same eclecticism that prevailed in the rest of Ottoman architecture of the 19th century. \nAmong the notable examples of Greek Orthodox churches is the Hagia Triada Church, a prominent building near Taksim Square in Beyoğlu which was built by the architect Vasilaki Ioannidi in 1880. Another is the Hagia Kyriaki Church in the Kumkapı neighbourhood, which was built in 1895 by local architects for the Karaman Greek community. Hagia Kyriaki is one of the few modern mosques in Istanbul built in the Byzantine tradition, using a central-domed layout. The Stefan Sveti Church (or Church of St. Stephen of the Bulgars) is a Bulgarian Orthodox church built between 1895 and 1898 in an eclectic style, located in the Balat neighbourhood. It was the first steel building in Istanbul, designed by architect Hovsep Aznavu. Its pieces were fabricated abroad and then assembled in Istanbul. \nAmong examples of 19th-century Armenian churches, the Surp Asdvadzadzin Church in Beşiktaş (not to be confused with the Surp Asdvadzadzin Patriarchal Church) was built in 1838 by Garabet Balyan. Its style deviated from traditional Armenian architecture in Istanbul and reflected instead the Neoclassical or Empire style that the Balyans used during the reign of Mahmud II, including an Ottoman-style dome. The Surp Asdvadzadzin Church in Gaziantep (later converted to the Kurtuluş Mosque) was built between 1878 and 1893 in an eclectic style that references European styles as well as local influences such as ablaq masonry, demonstrating that eclecticism was present far outside Istanbul. \nLater on, the largest and most famous Catholic church in Istanbul, the Church of St. Anthony in Beyoğlu, was built between 1906 and 1912 in a neo-Gothic style by architect Giulio Mongeri.\nIn addition to places of worship, new educational institutions and colleges associated with churches were built. In Fener, near the Greek Orthodox Patriarchal Church, the Phanar Greek Orthodox College (or Megalio Scholio in Greek) was built in 1881 to house a much older Greek educational institution. The structure is one of the most dominating features of the skyline in this area. The architect Konstantinos Dimandis most likely designed it with a neo-Byzantine style in mind.\n\nThe synagogues of Istanbul's longstanding Jewish community were comparatively unpretentious structures and few ancient synagogues have survived earthquakes and fires over the centuries. One of the oldest, the Ahrida Synagogue in Balat, was rebuilt in its current form in 1709 and reflects the architecture of the Tulip Period, though it was restored and refurbished again in the 19th century. Some notable 19th-century examples include the Italian Synagogue, built in the 1880s with a neo-Gothic façade, and the Ashkenazi Synagogue, inaugurated in 1900 with a European-style façade.\n\t19th-century churches and synagogues\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Clock towers ===\n\nAmong the new types of monuments introduced to Ottoman architecture during this era, clock towers rose to prominence over the 19th century. One of the earliest towers, and the earliest Ottoman clock tower featuring a bell, was the clock tower built by Izzet Mehmed Pasha in Safranbolu in 1798. Sometime between 1835 and 1839 Mahmud II erected the oldest clock tower in Istanbul, the Tophane Clock Tower near the Nusretiye Mosque, which was rebuilt in more monumental form by Abdülmecid in 1848 or 1849. The largest and most impressive clock tower in Istanbul is the Dolmabahçe Clock Tower (near Dolmabahçe Palace), which was built by Abdülhamid II in 1890–1894. It mixes late Baroque decoration with the Neoclassical and eclectic style of the 19th century. Both these towers, along with the Yıldız Clock Tower (1890), Bursa Clock Tower (rebuilt in 1905), and many others, are designed with a multi-level appearance. \n\nOther towers across the empire varied considerably in style. The Adana Clock Tower (1882), by contrast with the Istanbul examples, is a severe brick structure resembling the medieval Italian towers of San Gimignano. Other towers were built in a form resembling a minaret, such as the Çorum Clock Tower (1896). In 1901 Sultan Abdülhamid II (r. 1876–1909) encouraged the construction of clock towers across the empire for the celebration of the 25th anniversary of his accession to the throne. The Konak Clock Tower in Izmir is one example built that year. Eventually every sizeable Ottoman town was equipped with a clock tower.\n\tOttoman clock towers\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Commercial buildings ===\nIn the Beyoğlu district of Istanbul, Parisian-style shopping arcades appeared in the 19th century. Some arcades consisted of a small courtyard filled with shops and surrounded by buildings, as with the example of the Hazzopulo Pasajı, begun in 1850 and completed in 1871. Others were simply built as a passage or alley (pasaj in Turkish) lined with shops. They were commonly built in a Neoclassical style with some European Baroque-style decoration, and were sometimes covered with a glass roof. One of the best-known examples is the Çiçek Pasajı (\"Flower Passage\") built in 1876 as part of a building called the Cité de Pera, which contained shops on the ground floor and luxury apartments above. Other well-known examples include the Avrupa Pasajı (1874), the Atlas Pasajı (1877), the Halep (Aleppo) Pasajı (1880–1885), and the Suriye Pasajı (1908). \n\nOther commercial building types that appeared in the late 19th century included hotels, such as the Londra Hotel (1891) and Pera Palace Hotel designed by Alexandre Vallaury (1895), and banks, such as the Ottoman Bank building also designed by Vallaury (1890). These new buildings were also concentrated in the Beyoğlu district and many were again designed in a Neoclassical style, though eclecticism remained apparent in the details or interior decoration.\n\tNew commercial buildings\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Railway stations ===\nThe construction of railway stations was a feature of Ottoman modernisation reflecting the new infrastructure changes within the empire. The most famous example is the Sirkeci Railway Station, built in 1888–1890 as the terminus of the Orient Express. It was designed in an Orientalist style by German architect August Jasmund (also spelled \"Jachmund\"). The other major railway station of the era was Haydarpaşa Station, first built in 1872 when the railway to Baghdad was completed. The original building was a mix of Neoclassical, Baroque, and Orientalist styles. It was rebuilt in its current form in 1906–1908 by German architects Otto Ritter and Helmet Cuno in a German neo-Renaissance style. Both Sirkeci and Haydarpaşa stations were designed with a U-shaped layout with platforms in the center.\n\tRailway stations\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Orientalism (late 19th century) ==\nA local interpretation of Orientalist fashion steadily arose in the late 19th century, initially used by European architects such as Vallaury. This trend combined \"neo-Ottoman\" motifs with other motifs from wider Islamic architecture. The Sirkeci Railway Station (1888–1890), for example, was built in an Orientalist style, but its appearance makes more use of non-Ottoman Islamic architecture styles like Mamluk architecture than it does of Ottoman features. The iconic clock tower of Izmir (1901) was also built in a highly Orientalist style. Alexandre Vallaury, in collaboration with Raimondo D'Aronco, designed the neo-Ottoman-style Imperial School of Medicine in Üsküdar, built between 1893 and 1903. Another building with neo-Ottoman motifs by Vallaury is the Office of Public Debts (now serving as the Istanbul Erkek Lisesi), erected in Istanbul in 1897. The orientalist and Ottoman revivalist trends of this period, of which Vallaury was a major figure, eventually led to the First National Architecture movement which, alongside Art Nouveau, dominated architecture in the last years of the Ottoman Empire.\n\n\n== Art Nouveau (late 19th century) ==\nThe eclecticism and European imports of the 19th century eventually led to the introduction of Art Nouveau, especially after the arrival of Raimondo D'Aronco in the late 19th century. D'Aronco came at the invitation of Sultan Abdülhamid II and served as chief court architect between 1896 and 1909. Istanbul became a new center of Art Nouveau and a local flavour of the style developed. The new style was most prevalent in the new apartment buildings being built in Istanbul at the time. The Camondo Stairs in Galata, donated to the city by a local Jewish family in 1860, are an early Art Nouveau example. The Botter Apartment building (1900–1901) on Istiklal Street and the Tomb of Sheikh Zafir in Yıldız (1905–1906) are among the most notable examples designed by D'Aronco, in addition to some of his buildings in the Yıldız Palace. \n\nArt Nouveau decoration was applied to a wide variety of materials including stone, wood, stucco, and iron. Reflecting the continued eclecticism of the 19th century, they were also mixed with other styles such as neo-Baroque, neo-Ottoman, and Empire, such that Art Nouveau buildings were not always distinguishable from other genres. For example, the Hamidiye Fountain (1896–1901), originally erected in Tophane but later moved to Maçka Park, is a more eclectic work designed by D'Aronco.\n\tArt Nouveau in Istanbul\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== First National Architectural Movement (early 20th century) ==\n\nThe final period of architecture in the Ottoman Empire, developed after 1900 and in particular put into effect after the Young Turks took power in 1908–1909, is what was then called the \"National Architectural Renaissance\" and which gave rise to the style since referred to as the First national architectural movement of Turkish architecture. The approach in this period was an Ottoman Revival style, a reaction to influences in the previous 200 years that had come to be considered \"foreign\", such as Baroque and Neoclassical architecture, and was intended to promote Ottoman patriotism and self-identity. This was an entirely new style of architecture, related to earlier Ottoman architecture in rather the same manner was other roughly contemporaneous revivalist architectures related to their stylistic inspirations. New government-run institutions that trained architects and engineers, established in the late 19th century and further centralized under the Young Turks, became instrumental in disseminating this \"national style\".\nThe earlier Uṣūl-i Mi'marī-i Osmānī was influential in this movement and was used as a textbook at the Academy of Fine Arts in Istanbul (founded in 1883), but new Turkish architects also rejected some of the eclectic and revivalist impulses encouraged by that work. They choose instead to draw their ideas directly from observations of old Ottoman and Seljuk monuments, so as to elaborate what they viewed as a more purely \"Turkish\" style. They were also among the first to make measured drawings of historic Ottoman monuments and to study them as a national heritage.\nThe Ottoman Revival architecture of this period was based on modern construction techniques and materials such as reinforced concrete, iron, steel, and often glass roofs, and in many cases used what was essentially a Beaux-Arts structure with outward stylistic motifs associated with the original architecture from which it was inspired. The main difference between this style and the previous orientalist/revivalist trends led by European architects was a more conscious study of past Ottoman architecture and pre-Ottoman Turkish architecture in Anatolia in the search of a more uniform \"Turkish\" style. The new style focused outwardly on forms and motifs seen to be traditionally \"Ottoman\" such as pointed arches, ornate tile decoration, wide roof overhangs with supporting brackets, domes over towers or corners, etc. It also adapted these traditional elements for more modern building types such as railway stations, government offices, and other public buildings.\n\nThe emergence of this movement also brought Turkish architects back to the forefront of Ottoman architecture. The most important representatives of this architectural period are Vedat Tek (or Vedat Bey) and Ahmed Kemaleddin Bey. One of the earliest and most important examples is the Istanbul Grand Post Office in Sirkeci, completed in 1909 and designed by Vedat Tek. The most important example of Kemaleddin Bey's works is the Vakıf Han, also in Sirkeci, begun in 1914. Both of these buildings, which have grand facades with corner domes, are among the finest landmarks of the First National Architecture Movement. The style was also employed for mosques, of which the traditional-looking Bebek Mosque (1913) by Kemaleddin Bey is among the best examples. Other important extant examples include the Istanbul ferryboat terminals built between 1913 and 1917, such as the Besiktas terminal by Ali Talat Bey (1913), the Haydarpaşa ferry terminal by Vedat Tek (1913), the Buyukada terminal by Mihran Azaryan (1915). Another example is the Sultanahmet Jail (1916–1917), now a Four Seasons Hotel. In Ankara, the earliest building in the style is the building that now houses the War of Independence Museum and served as the first house of the Turkish Republic's National Assembly in 1920. It was built in 1917 by Ismail Hasif Bey as the local headquarters for the Young Turks' Committee of Union and Progress.\n\nOriginally, this style was meant to promote the patriotism and identity of the historically multi-ethnic Ottoman Empire, but by the end of World War I and the creation of the Turkish Republic, it was adopted by the republican Turkish nationalists to promote a new Turkish sense of patriotism. In this role, it continued into, and influenced the later architecture of the Republic of Turkey.\n\tFirst National Architecture Movement\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Early scholarly interest in Ottoman architecture ==\nIt was in the late 19th century that the first modern scholarly attempts to define historic Ottoman architecture as a distinctive style or tradition were undertaken. The first work to do so was the Uṣūl-i Mi'marī-i Osmānī (\"Fundamentals of Ottoman Architecture\"), published in 1873 simultaneously in Ottoman Turkish, French, and German. The publication took place in the context of the 1873 World Exposition in Vienna and had official support from the Ottoman state. It was drafted by Marie de Launay and Pietro Montani, under the supervision of Ibrahim Edhem Pasha, the Minister of Trade and Public Works at the time. The volume sought to define Ottoman architecture as a cohesive and rational architectural tradition and to make it compatible with emerging European discourses on architecture at the time. It was also the first work to hail Sinan as a figure of prime importance in Ottoman architectural history who was worthy of universal recognition.\nA year later (1874), Léon Parvillée, a student of Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, published L’architecture et décoration turque in French (\"Turkish architecture and decoration\"). While Viollet-le-Duc himself questioned the concept of an Ottoman architectural tradition in his preface to the book, Parvillée endorsed and promoted the idea that Ottoman architecture had originated from multiple older traditions and synthesized them into a unique style with specific principles. Parvillée was employed as an architect by the Ottoman state and was responsible for the restoration of many historic Ottoman monuments in Bursa, including some damaged by the 1855 earthquake. In the process, he also shaped modern understandings of the architecture of early Ottoman Bursa and some of the Ottoman monuments in Bursa owe much of their present-day appearance to his restorations.\n\n\n== See also ==\nYalı (waterside mansions)\nOttoman architecture in Egypt\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nAcun, Hakkı (2011).

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Messagesquisse (Message-Sketch) is a 1976 composition for solo cello and six cellos by Pierre Boulez.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1976, cellist Mstislav Rostropovich commissioned twelve composers (Conrad Beck, Luciano Berio, Boulez, Benjamin Britten, Henri Dutilleux, Wolfgang Fortner, Alberto Ginastera, Cristóbal Halffter, Hans Werner Henze, Heinz Holliger, Klaus Huber and Witold Lutosławski) to write pieces celebrating the 70th birthday of conductor and patron Paul Sacher. The composers were asked to base their works on the Sacher hexachord, in which Sacher's last name is spelled out as musical notes: eS-A-C-H-E-Re is translated into E♭-A-C-B-E-D (Es is E♭ in German; H is B♮ in German; Re is D♮ in French). These compositions were collected under the title 12 Hommages à Paul Sacher, and published together in the book Dank an Paul Sacher (Thanks to Paul Sacher). The complete cycle was not performed in its entirety until 9 May 2011, at a concert by cellist František Brikcius at the Convent of Saint Agnes, part of the National Gallery Prague, Czech Republic.\nBoulez's contribution to the tribute, Messagesquisse, is dedicated to Sacher \"with deep and faithful affection,\" and is a single-movement work scored for solo cello accompanied by an ensemble of six cellos, with a duration of roughly seven minutes. Its title is a portmanteau word that combines \"messages\" and \"esquisse\" (\"sketch\" in English). The work's pitch material is based on rotations of the Sacher hexachord, while its rhythms are derived from the letters of Sacher's last name represented in Morse code. Boulez biographer Dominique Jameux noted the work's \"clearly perceptible design,\" while musicologist Susan Bradshaw described it as \"a birthday telegram written in an easily decipherable musical code that relates everything to the single cell of an initiating series drawn from the letters of its dedicatee's name.\"\nBoulez would go on to base a series of compositions on the Sacher hexachord: Répons (1980, revised and expanded 1982 and 1984); Dérive 1 (1984); Incises (1994, revised and expanded 2001); and Sur Incises (1996–98).\n\n\n== Premiere and publication ==\nMessagesquisse was premiered on 3 July 1977 in La Rochelle, France, with soloist Pierre Penassou and conductor Michel Tabachnik. It was published by Universal Edition.\n\n\n== Alternate versions ==\nIn 2000, Boulez prepared a version of Messagesquisse for solo viola and six violas; it was premiered on 25 June 2000 in Aix-en-Provence, France, with soloist Christophe Desjardins accompanied by conservatory students, and is published by Universal Edition. An additional version for solo viola and tape was prepared in 2016; it was premiered on 23 January 2021 at a concert in Paris, France, with soloist Adrien La Marca.\nThe 2006 album Deutsche Grammophon ReComposed by Jimi Tenor, produced by Finnish musician Jimi Tenor, features \"a truly genre-bending version\" of Messagesquisse that \"finds an improbable common ground between such remote points as the hyperactive runs of Boulez's cello part, the burbling electronics of acid house, and bluegrass fiddle music.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nReviewing a 1999 performance at Carnegie Hall, Bernard Holland called Messagesquisse \"a charmer, exploiting the sound of a single instrument multiplied seven times and doing it with great delicacy.\" He also acknowledged the fact that the audience \"loved this piece.\" Regarding a 2016 performance at New York's 92nd Street Y, Anthony Tommasini described the work as \"music of wondrous precision and vibrant color.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\nSources\n\nBonnet, Antoine (1987). \"Ecriture and perception: on Messagesquisse by Pierre Boulez\".

        "content": "The 2024 Columbia University pro-Palestinian campus occupation is an ongoing protest involving Palestinian nationalist and anti-Zionist students at Columbia University in New York City. The protests began on April 17, 2024, when pro-Palestinian students established an encampment of approximately fifty tents, calling it the \"Gaza Solidarity Encampment\", on the university's campus. The protests seek to cease Columbia University's financial support of Israel.\nThe campus occupation has been organized by Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), a student-led coalition of over 120 groups, together with Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP), which have often participated in New York City's pro-Palestinian demonstrations since the start of the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in October 2023. Another group, Within Our Lifetime (WOL), has been protesting outside around the campus perimeter in support of the encampment, clashing with the NYPD.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Israel–Hamas war demonstrations at Columbia University ===\n\nZionist and Palestinian nationalist students have gathered at Columbia University during the Israel–Hamas war. The university closed its campus after pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian demonstrations collided several days after the war began. In November 2023, Columbia University administrations suspended SJP and JVP after they held an unauthorized student walkout, furthering conflicts between faculty and administration; the university claimed that one person at the event shouted anti-Semitic epithets. That same month, students walked out of a class taught by Hillary Clinton in support of Palestine after her comments against a ceasefire. \nIn January 2024, students at a pro-Palestinian demonstration on campus were attacked with Skunk, a foul-smelling spray usually used as crowd control by the Israel Defense Forces, causing various injuries. In response, demonstrators organized a protest outside the university. The incident is currently being investigated by the New York City Police Department as a potential hate crime. SJP and JVP published a report in which they stated the perpetrators were former IDF soldiers and current Columbia students.\n\n\n=== Nemat Shafik's testimony ===\nColumbia University president Nemat Shafik testified before the House Committee on Education and the Workforce on April 17, 2024; opposition to Shafik by students mounted.\n\n\n== Protests ==\n\n\n=== April 17 ===\nOn April 17, approximately seventy protesters sat in tents bearing the Palestinian flag on the South Lawn. Protestors put up banners reading \"Gaza Solidarity Encampment\" and \"Liberated Zone\". A substantial NYPD presence was noted outside the university as soon as the encampment had been established. Activity in the encampment included a teach-in and film screening.\n\n\n=== April 18 ===\nThe following day, Shafik authorized the New York City Police Department Strategic Response Group entered the encampment to arrest protesters as Columbia University employees cleared the tents. Three students were suspended, including Isra Hirsi, the daughter of representative Ilhan Omar. After the New York Police Department appeared, a group of Jewish counterprotesters congregated to celebrate the university's response, waving American and Israeli flags. A protest on 114th Street and Amsterdam Avenue formed, but dispersed to allow buses with detained protesters to exit. Pro-Palestinian demonstrators recovered signage and repitched several tents.\nHundreds of students began forming a picket on the Furnald Lawn, west of the South Lawn. Public intellectual and independent presidential candidate Cornel West appeared to show solidarity. A group protested outside of the university's main entrance on 116th Street. Protesters on 116th Street and Broadway moved towards 120th Street after a man was taken into custody.\n\n\n=== April 19 ===\nProtestors have remained camped out on campus; SJP chapters at the University of North Carolina, Boston University, and Ohio State University, as well as the Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee at Harvard University, have announced rallies in solidarity with the Columbia protestors.\n\n\n== Responses ==\nRepresentative Jerrold Nadler, an alumnus of Columbia University and the House of Representatives's longest-serving Jewish member, wrote that \"Columbia has an obligation to protect students and their learning environment\".\nNew York City mayor Eric Adams commented, “Students have a right to free speech, but do not have a right to violate university policies and disrupt learning on campus”.\n\n\n== See also ==\n1968 Columbia University protests\nBoycott, Divestment and Sanctions\nStudent protest\n\n\n== References ==",

The season is filmed in the Prekmurje region of Slovenia where 19 Slovenians compete on the Farm against each other to win the grand prize of €50,000. Saša Lendero returned as presenter for the series, leading discussions during nominations and hosting duels. The main twist this season is that amongst the contestants are two couples, (Maja Martinec & Niko Žižek) and (Fahrudin \"Faki\" Čaušević and Maruša Kraševec) all fighting to win but also trying to hide their relationship from the others. In addition, three contestants joined the farm after the first day. The season premiered on 30 August 2015 and concluded with a live finale on 11 December 2015 where Fahrudin \"Faki\" Čaušević won in the final duel against Franc Vozel to win the grand prize and win the title. \n\n\n== Contestants ==\n\n\n== The game ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Ismaël Diadié Haïdara, also known as Ismaël Qutti, is a Malian poet, writer, and librarian who founded the Fondo Kati manuscript library in Timbuktu, Mali.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHaïdara was born in March 1957 in Bajindé, Tombouctou Region, French Sudan. He descends from the famous Timbuktu historian Mahmud Kati, who wrote the Tarikh al-fattash history of the Songhai Empire. In his own words, Haïdara was expelled from the Tin-A-Ten Nomade School for failing to pass the exam moving him from sixth grade to seventh grade. He obtained his diploma in 1972 on his third try of schooling. Haïdara wrote his first verses of poetry at age 20, becoming a member of the Writers' Union of Mali and the Artists' Union of Mali.\nHaïdara graduated from the National Institute of Arts in Bamako majoring in Dramatic Arts. After his studies in Bamako, he worked at the Ahmed Baba Institute in Timbuku. While working there, he discovered his lineage to Mahmud Kati, and that his father was adopted by a Haïdara, hence the name. By interviewing elders in and around Timbuktu, Haïdara discovered that his Jewish heritage had been hidden in fear of persecution. In response, Haïdara created the Zakhor foundation in 1993, meaning remembrance, and the Timbuktu Association for Friendship with the Jewish World, which is composed of descendants of Malian Jews and is dedicated to researching the Jewish history of Mali.\nHaïdara founded the Fondo Kati manuscript library in Timbuktu, and along with his wife have catalogued around 13,000 of his family's private manuscript collection. Zakhor disbanded early on in the Mali War after the Fall of Timbuktu, when Ansar Dine and Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb seized control of the city. Haidara and his collection survived the burning of manuscripts conducted by the Islamists; him and his wife hid the books among clothes and smuggled a number of the manuscripts south. Haidara fled to Spain following the fall, and continued his work digitizing manuscripts.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "St Thomas' Church is the parish church of Brompton, a village near Northallerton in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThere was a church on the site by the 11th century, but the oldest surviving parts of the current church are parts of the north aisle and south wall of the nave, dating from about 1180.  The chancel was rebuilt in the 14th century, when the nave was lengthened, and the north aisle was raised in height.  The tower was added in the 15th century.  The nave was repaired in 1638, and the chancel in 1660, both occasions marked by plaques on the relevant south walls.  The church was restored by Ewan Christian in 1868, which included the replacement of most of the windows, removal of the gallery, and the addition of a chancel arch, organ chamber and vestry.  The building was grade I listed in 1970.\n\nThe church is built of stone with Welsh slate roofs, and consists of a nave, a north aisle, a chancel, a north vestry, and a partly embraced southwest tower incorporating a porch.  The tower has three stages, diagonal buttresses, a south doorway with a chamfered surround and a basket arch, a hood mould and a small niche.  Above are chamfered bands, clock faces, two-light bell openings, an embattled parapet with corner crocketed pinnacles, and a pyramidal roof.  Inside the church are pre-Norman items, including three early 10th century hogback tombstones with flanking sitting bears, and two crosses.  There is a 17th-century chest in the vestry, and the west window has stained glass by Charles Eamer Kempe.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGrade I listed buildings in North Yorkshire\nListed buildings in Brompton, west North Yorkshire\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Yanqin Wu (Chinese: 武延庆) is a theoretical astrophysicist whose research concerns planet formation, protoplanetary disks, the effects on planets of photoevaporation, orbital resonance, and planetary migration, and the classification and distribution of exoplanets. She has theorized that planetary collisions have culled initially-crowded systems until what remains is often on the edge of chaos, and used oscillations in the rings of Saturn to study the past history of the Solar System. Educated in China and the US, she has worked in England and Canada, where she is a professor in the Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics of the University of Toronto.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nWu is originally from Guangzhou. She was an undergraduate at the University of Science and Technology of China, graduating in 1991. She became a graduate student at the California Institute of Technology, and completed her Ph.D. there in 1997. Her dissertation, Excitation and Saturation of White Dwarf Pulsation, was supervised by Peter Goldreich.\nAfter postdoctoral research at Queen Mary University of London from 1998 to 1999, and at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics in Toronto from 2000 to 2003, she became an assistant professor of astronomy at the University of Toronto in 2003. She was promoted to associate professor in 2008 and full professor in 2016.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nWu is a Guggenheim Fellow, awarded in 2022. She is the 2023 recipient of the CAP-CRM Prize in Theoretical and Mathematical Physics of the Canadian Association of Physicists and Centre de Recherches Mathématiques.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome page at the University of Toronto\nPersonal home page\nYanqin Wu publications indexed by Google Scholar",

In Tam's Sefer haYashar, a number of problems of Talmudic interpretation are posed to him by Moses. They became a standard part of the tosafot. In one, it is learned that Moses' brother let a convert live in his house and later partnered with him in business. Later tosafists also cite Moses in their commentaries on the Torah. Samson of Sens cites his commentary on the Mishnah. In the 16th century, Hayim ben Bezalel claimed to have a copy of this work. Moses also wrote liturgical poems. One, only two-lines long, is preserved in the Azharot of Elijah ben Menahem HaZaken.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==",

T. asahii is the most prominent human pathogen in its genus, causing more than half of all Trichosporon infections. First discovered and named in 1929, The currently accepted nomenclature of T. asahii was validated in 1994.\n\n\n== Disease ==\nThe clinical manifestations of T. asahii infection are non-specific and vary depending on the site of infection. The most common types of infection were urinary tract infections, fungemia, and disseminated infection. Cutaneous infections have also been reported.\n\n\n== Identification and culture ==\nT. asahii grows readily on routine laboratory media, producing white, yellow, or cream, yeast-like colonies on Sabouraud dextrose agar. This fungus has a rapid growth rate and colonies mature in 5 days. When grown on cornmeal-Tween 80 agar, true hyphae, pseudohyphae, and blastoconidia can be seen under microscopic examination. Arthroconidia can be observed in older cultures. This fungus is able to hydrolyze urea through the production of urease.\n\n\n== Treatment ==\nESCMID/ECMM guidelines recommend the use of voriconazole for the treatment of invasive T. asahii infections. Patients have also been treated with amphotericin B and triazole therapy.\n\n\n== References ==",

He was a significant success on the sporting field.  He played in the cricket XI every year from 1875 to 1878, being captain for the last two seasons, and won the Athletic Challenge Cup in 1878.  Charterhouse was also an early powerhouse in football, and Growse played for the school's football XI in from 1874 to 1878, again taking the captaincy in the last year.\nHe went up to Balliol College, Oxford in 1878, and collected a Blue in athletics, being runner-up in the inter-varsity 440 yards in 1880 and 1881 - in the latter year it required a world record from Reginald Macaulay to beat him.\n\n\n== Football career ==\nCuriously, he never represented the Oxford University A.F.C. in competitive football, but did act as umpire for the O.U.A.F.C. on occasion.  Before he went up to Oxford, he had played against the university in the 1877–78 FA Cup as full-back for the Clapham Rovers - he had previously played against the Rovers for Charterhouse School and the Cup tie was his début in the Cup.\nHe also played for the new Brentwood side as half-back in the 1877–78 season, two of his brothers also being regulars for Brentwood;  Growse occasionally played for Brentwood until early 1881.\nHe scored his first goal in the second round of the 1878–79 FA Cup, in a 10–1 rout of Forest School, by which time he had moved to centre-forward.  More crucially he scored the only goal of the quarter-final tie against Cambridge University, in extra-time, by allowing an Arthur Stanley cross-shot to bounce off his knee under the tape.  He remained one of the two centre-forwards for the rest of the competition, but was on the losing side in the final, the Rovers losing to the Old Etonians; Growse was considered the only Rovers forward \"up to the mark\".\nFor the 1879–80 season, he pledged his loyalty to the new Old Carthusians club, but the luck of the draw was against them, and the O.C.s lost against the Wanderers at their favoured Kennington Oval in the second round.  It was unfortunate timing for Growse as Clapham Rovers won the competition for the only time.  He did at least have the consolation of earning representative honours for the London Football Association, scoring in the London FA's defeat at the Birmingham Football Association in 1880.  \nThe Carthusians went on to win the competition in 1880–81, but Growse again missed out on a winner's medal.  His last game came in the 2–0 win at the Royal Engineers in the fourth round, playing on the left side of the forward line.  He was not included against his former Clapham Rovers team-mates in the quarter-final and never regained his place.  This was probably due to clashes with athletic competition - the semi-final was two days after the University of Oxford annual athletics competition, in which Growse came joint second in the quarter-mile, and the Cup final was two days after the Varsity athletics.\nThere were evidently no hard feelings, as his final appearance at a football match was as the Carthusians' nominated umpire for a match against Notts County when on leave in February 1882.\n\n\n== Cricket career ==\nFrom 1877 to 1881, Growse played six matches for the Essex County Cricket Club, the first (as opening bat against the M.C.C.) when he was still at school.  His highest score was 64, against Felsted School in 1880, and, although not a specialist bowler, he took two wickets against Tooting Wanderers Cricket Club in 1880.  He did return to cricket during a decade later for a handful of matches for the Old Carthusians XI.\n\n\n== Post-football and personal life ==\nHis football career ended abruptly as he was recruited into the Indian Civil Service and sent to Bengal in 1881.  He worked most of his life in India, with a family home in Cheltenham, and married Emily Ouseley in 1883.  The couple had one son, Hugh, who also went to Charterhouse and joined the South Wales Borderers in 1905.\nHe died in the Red Sea on 10 November 1905, while returning to England.  He was survived by his widow and son.\n\n\n== External links ==\nCricket appearances\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Being Claudine is a 2000 American romantic comedy film directed by I-fan Quirk.  The film follows the hapless love life of its central character, fledgling New York City actress Claudine Bloomberg, played by Justine Lichtman.  Being Claudine began life as a student film; it was director I-fan Quirk's thesis project for New York University.  The film made its public debut at the Fort Worth Film Festival in Fort Worth, Texas, on October 21, 2000.  It was given a limited theatrical release in New York City on July 19, 2002, where it received negative reviews from critics.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nCritical reception to Being Claudine was overwhelmingly negative.  The film received a rating of 17 out of 100 on review aggregate Metacritic, indicating \"Universal dislike or disgust\" from critics.  The Village Voice stated that \"Savaging wooden, graceless, derivative student films is, admittedly, like punting a three-legged puppy, but that's what Quirk and his breed get for so stupidly undervaluing filmgoers' time.\"  The New York Post described the film as a \"feeble shot at a screwball comedy\".  The New York Times described Being Claudine as a \"good-natured but amateurish film\".  The A.V. Club stated that the film \"grinds through a shopworn plot\" and derided I-fan Quirk's direction, opining that \"Quirk provides nothing to get excited about; even when he cuts frames to speed conversations along, his pacing stumbles, and his dialogue isn't worth suffering through all the awkward pauses.\"  Variety stated: \"Though competently shot (on film, no less) and framed by helmer I-Fan Quirk, pic is quickly overtaken by an urge to let its sincere but dull characters chat away endlessly.\"  The Chicago Reader described Being Claudine as \"no more memorable than an episode of Caroline in the City.\"  One of the film's only positive reviews came from Film Threat, which stated that \"Justine Lichtman is consistently funny and watchable even when she's doing nothing.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site (archived)\nBeing Claudine at IMDb \nBeing Claudine at AllMovie",

        "content": "The \"Pizza Meter\" is a term used to describe how the increase in pizza orders from offices of the United States government, such as the White House and The Pentagon, can be indicative of important political or military events. The concept is based on empirical observations and has been mentioned in various media as a possible crisis predictor.\nThe phenomenon is part of a broader set of unconventional intelligence methods, grouped under various subcategories of open-source intelligence (OSINT).\n\n\n== Origin and development ==\nThe notion that an increase in pizza orders could signal significant government activity first emerged during the Cold War, when high volumes of pizza deliveries to key facilities such as the Central Intelligence Agency and the United States Department of State were observed to coincide with moments of international crisis. It is believed that Soviet officials monitored these orders as indicators of American strategic moves.\nThis phenomenon was described in detail by Mark M. Lowenthal, an expert on intelligence and national security, in his book Intelligence: From the Secrets of Politics. Lowenthal introduces the term 'PIZZINT' (Pizza Intelligence), within the broader framework of 'OSINT' (Open-Source Intelligence), which refers to the analysis of publicly available information.\n\n\n=== Origin of the term \"Pizza Meter\" ===\nFrank Meeks, the owner of the 45-restaurant Washington, D.C. Domino's franchise, began noticing an increase in pizza orders from U.S. government offices (such as the Pentagon) just before a major announcement from the White House. The public dubbed the phenomenon the \"Pizza Meter,\" although shortly after the information was released, government offices stopped purchasing pizza all at once from Domino's in Washington, D.C., and began purchasing pizza at separate times or in different pizzerias.\n\n\n== Notable incidents ==\nJust before the 1983 invasion of Grenada and the 1989 invasion of Panama, Domino's pizza deliveries increased dramatically, with deliveries made by Domino's just before the invasion of Panama increasing by 25%.\nOn the night of August 1, 1990, the eve of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, military personnel at the Pentagon met to discuss issues in the Middle East. Since they planned to stay up all night arguing, they ordered several more pizzas than usual from Domino's. In total, fifteen Domino's pizza deliveries were made that night, with 101 pizza deliveries made during the week before the invasion. Furthermore, on the same day, between 8:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m., fifty-five pizzas were delivered to the White House, much more than was normally ordered.\nOn August 21, 1991, a record number of pizzas were delivered to the Pentagon and the White House, in the middle of the 1991 Soviet coup attempt. This incident surpassed the previous record during the invasion of Kuwait, suggesting that the increase in pizza orders may reflect crisis management preparedness.\nOn November 17, 1995, a phenomenon known locally as \"pizza night\" occurred, which years later would end up triggering the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal.\nOn April 13, 2024, Iran launched a drone and missile attack against Israel, in retaliation for an Israeli attack on an Iranian consulate annex in Syria on April 1. That night, an unusual increase in pizza orders was observed in the United States, especially at chains located near important government headquarters such as the Pentagon and the White House.\nThis increase coincided with the saturation of activity in local pizzerias, as reported on Twitter by user @donald_PL_. The user shared screenshots from Google Maps showing elevated activity at Papa John's and Extreme Pizza locations in Washington, D.C., around 6:00 p.m. local time, coinciding with the time of Iran's attack on Israel. This user described the \"Pizza Meter\" as an indicator that \"assesses the United States' involvement in global crises based on footfall at local pizzerias.\"\n\n\n== Impact and consequences ==\nThe \"Pizza Meter\" has been referenced in several news articles as a useful instrument for predicting crises. Reports observing the relationship between pizza orders and crisis events has had a cultural and operational impact within government agencies. For example, the Pentagon has modified its internal food options to include fast food chains capable of offering service during extended hours, in response to the need for available food during overnight emergencies.\n\n\n== See also ==\nWaffle House Index – Informal metric to rate disaster severity\nPizza Principle – comparison of the prices of pizza slices and New York City subway rides\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Mann Gulch fire was a wildfire reported on August 5, 1949, in a gulch located along the upper Missouri River in the Gates of the Mountains Wilderness (then known as the Gates of the Mountains Wild Area), Helena National Forest, in the state of Montana in the United States. A team of 15 US Forest Service smokejumpers parachuted into the area on the afternoon of August 5, 1949, to fight a 50-60 acre (20-24 hectare) lightning-caused blaze, assisted by a local recreation guard. As the team approached the fire, an unexpected change in wind direction caused the fire to ignite heavy fuels, creating a \"blowup\" and cutting off the men's escape route to the Missouri River. The crew was forced to retreat uphill into a lightly timbered area with a dense groundcover of extremely flammable grass and brush. The fire moved rapidly up the slope, burning 3,000 acres (1,200 ha) in ten minutes and claiming the lives of 13 firefighters, including 12 of the smokejumpers. Only three of the smokejumpers survived. The fire would continue for five more days before being controlled.\n\n\n= Timeline of Events =\nThe following chronology combines two parallel narratives: 1) Canyon Ferry District Ranger John Robert Jansson's effort to provide support for the smokejumpers and 2) the events surrounding the deaths of the 13 crewmen led by foreman R. Wagner Dodge in Mann Gulch.\n4 August 1949\n4:00 pm – An intense electrical storm passed over Gates of the Mountains Wild Area, sparking eight fires. John Robert Jansson, Canyon Ferry District Ranger, quickly organized the suppression of the four fires that had been reported in his jurisdiction. A lightning strike on the upper south slope of Mann Gulch (within the Canyon Ferry RD) produced a holdover fire (a so-called \"sleeper\") that initially went undetected.\nFire danger rating on 4 August was not critical, ranking 16 out of a possible 100, but temperatures in recent days had been in the upper 90s °F (upper 30s °C) with low humidity. The cooler and wetter 1948 summer had provided for a prolific grass understory and seed production in the spring of 1949.\nConcerned about sleeper fires, Jansson requested an aerial survey of the district for 6:00 am on the following day, 5 August.\n\n5 August 1949\n8:00 am – US Forest Service aerial observers report no new fires at Mann Gulch.\n9:00 am (approx.) – Ranger Jansson contacted James O. Harrison, former smokejumper and recreation guard at the Meriwether Canyon guard station and directed him to conduct a foot patrol in Mann Gulch to search for possible sleeper fires.\n11:00 am – Jansson flew observation over Mann Gulch, but saw no evidence of fire and returned to the Helena airport.\n11:30 am (\"late morning\") – Jim Harrison located a new fire on Mann Gulch.\n12:15 pm – Harrison attempted to report the fire to Missoula office and the Canyon Ferry RD by radio, but was unable to establish contact. He climbed 1500 feet (460 meters) from the Meriwether Guard Station to reach the fire perimeter and began to work on the blaze with his Pulaski about 1:30 pm.\n12:18 pm – Colorado Mountain Lookout, 30 miles away, reported smoke in Mann Gulch. Jansson, arriving back at Helena airport detected smoke on the district, but was perplexed because he just flew Mann Gulch and had seen nothing.\n12:55 pm –Returning to Mann Gulch to fly a second survey, Jansson located a 6 to 8 acre (2.4 to 3.2 hectares) fire along the upper south slope of the gulch. He considered the rate of growth of the sleeper \"unusual\" and \"exceptional.\"\n1:00 pm (early afternoon) – Jansson begins to assemble and mobilize ground crews to fight the Mann Gulch fire.\n1:45 pm – Helena National Forest Supervisor Arthur Duncan Moir believed the fire required a rapid response and ordered the deployment of twenty-five smokejumpers to the remote site. The blaze was regarded as manageable for a small firefighting crew until a larger ground crew arrived.\n\n\n=== Mobilization ===\n2:30 pm – A C-47 departed from Missoula's Hale Field, 100 miles (160 kilometers) west of the gulch carrying 16 jumpers and their equipment - the airplanes maximum capacity. (Additional smokejumpers were available for action, but all other transport planes were engaged on other projects). The smokejumpers, including the foreman, ranged in age from 17 to 33 (average age, 22). The majority of the firefighters were attending forestry classes at the Montana State University in Missoula. For most of them, this was their first year in the smokejumper program.\n2:30 – 4:30 pm – Jansson and his alternate, Ranger Harry Hersey, recruited nineteen able-bodied ground firefighters, just three of whom had served previously on fires. Logistical and transportation delays plagued the mobilization. On the way to the planned assembly area at the mouth of Mann Gulch, Jansson suspected that the fire might be encroaching into Merriweather Canyon, a scenic area. He directed Hersey to ascend the Meriwether trail with the 19-man ground crew and attack the fire at the Mann Gulch/Meriwether ridge. The temperature at Helena, 25 miles to the south, was reaching 97 °F (36 °C), the hottest day on record to date. The fire danger rating was calculated at 74 out of 100: \"explosive stage\".\n3:10 pm – C-47 pilot Kenneth Huber located the fire in Mann Gulch and began to circle. Spotter and jumpmaster Earl Cooley and crew foreman R. Wagner Dodge appraised the fire. They observed that since 4 August, the lightning caused blaze had scorched 50 to 60 acres, originating in Mann Gulch and spreading upslope and south to the crest at Meriwether Canyon, where it had crowned and burnt out without generating any spot fires. The fire was moving gradually downhill to the northeast (up gulch) through sparse grass. The fire appeared to be routine.\n\n3:50 pm to 4:10 pm – Smokejumpers and cargo drops completed. (Figure 1) After dropping the men at the customary 1200 feet (368 meters) elevation, Huber took the C-47 to 2000 feet (613 meters) to drop the equipment because of heavy turbulence. As a result, the gear was widely scattered on the north slope delaying its retrieval.\nSeveral of the sixteen smokejumpers experienced flight sickness due to the turbulence and one of them became too ill to jump. Merle \"Skip\" Stratton submitted his resignation from the US Forest Service when the airplane returned to Missoula that evening, before news of the tragedy was reported. He would be return to Mann Gulch to assist in the recovery operation of his deceased comrades.\nDodge was not provided with topographical maps of the area and was expected to obtain them when he encountered ground crews at the site.\nThe single-sideband radio was smashed when its static line broke and the chute failed to deploy.\n4:35 pm – Jansson proceeded by boat along the Missouri towards the mouth of Mann Creek to begin a survey of its south slope and to establish contact with the smokejumpers.\n4:55 pm – Smokejumper equipment collected and assembled at cargo area. (Figure 1) The crew was about one mile as the raven flies up the drainage from the Missouri River. They could see the fire's perimeter about 0.25 miles (0.4 kilometers) to the southwest on the south slope which appeared to be burning away from the crew. The men were \"not greatly impressed\" with the blaze and only concerned that \"the steep and rocky ground\" would make mop up difficult the next morning. Smokejumper Robert Sallee later remarked, \"I took a look at the fire and decided it wasn't bad. It was burning on top of the ridge and I thought it would continue on up the ridge ...\"\n5:00 pm – The smokejumpers heard a shout near the fire perimeter. Foreman Dodge ordered squad leader Bill Hellman to take charge while he went to investigate. He discovered Jim Harrison near the fire line.\n5:02 pm – Jansson began his ascent up Mann Gulch by foot. Visibility was about 200 yards (182 meters) due to dense smoke. Winds in the lower gulch were between 20 and 30 mi/h (32 to 48 km/h), gusting to 40 mi/h (64 km/h), much higher than those occurring in Helena, 25 miles (40 kilometers) to the south.\n5:10 pm – After spending about 10 minutes tooling up at the cargo area, the smokejumpers crossed the dry gulch bottom and began to climb the south slope towards the fire. Eleven of the smokejumpers were double-tooled, bearing both a Pulaski and a shovel. Two of the men carried the two-man crosscut saws and one man shouldered the 5-gallon (19 liter) jug mounted on a backpack.\n5:12 pm – 5:15 pm – Dodge called to the crew to halt when they had advanced up the slope about 100 yards (92 meters) and he rejoined them immediately with Harrison. Dodge, in consultation with Harrison who has been on the fire for four hours, announced that the crew \"had better get out of that thick reproduction [heavy fuels]\" – dense stands of second-growth ponderosa pine and Douglas fir. The crew was downwind of the fire, a potential \"death trap\" according to Dodge.\nDodge directed Hellman to cross back to the north side of the gulch and march the men southwest and to \"sidehill\" (follow the contour) towards the Missouri River. He cautioned them to stay high enough up the north slope to keep the fire on the south slope in view. The plan was to attack the fire on its western flank (the upwind position) so as to prevent its spread into Meriwether Canyon. Dodge was not yet alarmed and returned with Harrison about 300 yards (276 meters) to the cargo assembly area to pick up some food and water while Hellman proceeded west with the smokejumpers. From the elevated position at the cargo area, Dodge could see that the fire was \"boiling up\" and determined he would evacuate the men from Mann Gulch.\nDuring the past hour, the wind had shifted 180° and was now coming from the south and blowing forcefully upgulch.\n\n\n=== \"Blowup\" and Retreat ===\n5:15 pm – Ranger Jansson had walked almost 0.5 miles (0.8 kilometers) from the mouth of Mann Gulch in the thickening smoke. (Figure 1) Spot fires were appearing around him. He was witnessing the early stages of the south slope \"blowup\" about 300 yards (276 meters) south of where the smokejumpers would be forced to flee up the north slope just minutes later. Jansson believed he heard metallic noises of men wielding tools and walked another 200 yards (61 meters) upslope to investigate, but the sound was probably an aural hallucination caused by the raging fire.\nThe fire's rapid descent from the Meriwether Canyon ridge downslope to the mouth of the gulch was likely propelled by a brief thunderstorm at the Meriwether Canyon ridge . During this \"blowup\" event a wind vortex produced \"fire whirls\", lofting burning debris over to the north slope.\n5:30 pm – Jansson began to retreat down the gulch. The superheated air had created a thermal \"convection vortex\" that threatened to sear his lungs. He made a dash to escape but momentarily passed out. Recovering just as flames were a few yards (meters) away, he fled down gulch and reached the river at 5:41 pm. Approximately  the same time Jansson was fleeing from the \"blowup\" near the mouth of the gulch, Dodge and his men were, unawares, marching directly towards it.\n5:40 pm – Dodge and Harrison overtook the crew to find that that the men had split into two groups about 500 feet (152 meters) apart. Dodge gathered the men into a single column and led them down gulch with Hellman taking the rear.\n\n5:45 pm – Leading the column, Dodge saw that the south slope fire had jumped to the north slope of Mann Gulch directly west of them and was advancing towards them steadily, driven by the up gulch wind. The blaze was igniting heavy fuels, including conifer reproduction and creating high intensity crown fires, with multiple spotting. Btu's per foot per second were estimated to range from 400 to 1000. Wind driven flames were about 7 – 10 feet (2.1 - 3.0 meters) high and moving diagonally uphill towards the smokejumpers.\nThe route to the river was clearly blocked. Dodge instantly ordered his men to reverse direction and move upslope and cross-contour, climbing obliquely to the northeast. (Figure 1, Pt 1) The fire front, about 150 – 200 yards (138 – 184 meters) distance was advancing at an estimated rate of 120 feet per minute (37 meters per minute) or 1.4 miles per hour [mi/h] (22 kilometers per hour) [km/h].\nThe men proceeded up the cross-contour 18% grade through scattered stands of mature ponderosa pine. The grassy groundcover stood about 2.5 feet (0.75 meters) high (thigh to waist deep).  The men were walking at a rate of 2 mph (3.2 km/h) and still carrying their firefighting equipment.\nAt the time the column of firefighters begin their retreat, they had about a four or five minute head start on the fire. \n\nThe behavior of the fire was about to change under the influence of the turbulent winds, steep slope and the lighter and more volatile ground cover. When the wind, estimated at 30 mi/h (48 km/h), pushed the fire into the grass understory, its speed accelerated to an estimated 280 feet per minute (86 meters per minute) or 3.2 mi/h (5.1 km/h). Heat intensity also increased, rising to 2500 – 4000 Btu. The leading edge of the flames were reaching 16–20 feet (4.9 to 6.1 meters) in height. While the fire accelerated under the influence of the increasing slope, the smokejumpers progress slowed.\n5:53 pm – Dodge ordered the crew to drop tools and packs (some men had already jettisoned their equipment, others continued to cling to them). (Figure 1, Pt 2) Artifacts discovered later at the tool drop site were found within a 50-foot radius (15 meter), indicating that the column was still cohesive at this point. Testimony from survivors suggests that beyond the drop site some of the men began to break away in a race for the ridge.\nThe advancing wall of fire was about 100 yards (92 meters) from the column and rapidly overtaking them from the west and south. By this time, the men knew they were in a desperate situation. Unburdened, they increased their pace to about 4 mph (6.4 km/h).\nThe crew suddenly emerged from the sparse timber and into a mostly treeless expanse where they could clearly see the top of Mann Gulch ridge. The groundcover here was dry and highly combustible Cheat grass and Fescue, tinder dry in the near 100 °F (38 °C) heat. Leaving the timber behind, the surface winds were estimated to have increased, with gusts up to 40 mph (64 km/h).\nWhen the fire blew into this open landscape it was travelling at a variable rate 360–610 feet per minute (110 – 187 meters per minute), or 4.1 to 6.9 mph (6.6 to 11.0 km/h). The Btu's had risen to 5,500 -9000. The flames ranged in height from 10 – 40 feet (3.1 – 12.3 meters).\n\n5:55 pm – At 220 yards (202 meters) beyond the equipment drop, Dodge walking in the lead of the column, reached a small grassy clearly at a steep grade break. (Figure 1, Pt 3) This position was 200 yards (184 meters) from the top of the ridge, measured at right angles (perpendicular) to the contour.\nThe fire had gained on the crew at every stage of their retreat. Despite having doubled their speed, the fire had closed to within 50 yards (46 meters) of the rear of the column.\nDodge judged that he and his men could not reach the ridge before being overtaken and engulfed by the flames. The fire was advancing at an estimated average rate of 660 ft/min (202 meters/mi) or 7.5 mi/h (12 km/h), an extremely rapid spread. The temperature of fire was estimated to measure at least 1500 °F (815 °C).\nApplying a principle of basic fire science, Dodge immediately ignited a flimsy \"gofer\" match and swept it across the grass. The flames quickly spread uphill, initially burning at relatively low intensity. The wind at his position was lighter due to the backdraft created by the approaching inferno. Within seconds his grass fire had grown to one hundred square feet (9.2 square meters). Dodge's intention was to create a fuel-free zone, where the crew could take refuge. He expected that the main fire would roar around the burnt over area, leaving the men unharmed. No protocol existed in the US Forest Service for this so-called \"escape fire.\"\nFour smokejumpers at the head of the column – Walter Rumsey, Robert Sallee, Eldon Diettert and squad leader Hellman – reached the foreman first and were bewildered by his actions, despite his efforts to explain his purpose. The men hesitated for a few moments, then one of them said \"To hell with that, I'm getting out of here\" and the men rushed straight uphill towards the ridge about 200 yards distance. Sallee, a survivor, would later declare that \"No one could live who left Dodge even seconds after we did.\" (Figure 2)\n\nAbout eight crewmen (exactly which of the crewmen is uncertain) advanced close enough to Dodge and the escape fire to see him motioning with his arms towards the burnt area and calling to them over the din of the roaring fire just yards (meters) away. There is conjecture that four of the smokejumpers may have already fled ahead or were too far back in the column to hear him. A number of the firefighters reached further up the slope to a distance of about 375 yards (345 (meters) beyond the escape fire. This suggests that they may have been in advance of Dodge before be ignited his survival fire.\nThese eight firefighters hesitated briefly, perhaps no longer than 10 or 15 seconds before plunging onward up the canyon and angling towards the ridge. None of these men heeded Dodge.\nSeveral of the firefighters had little more than a 15-second lead on the wall of fire as they passed the escape fire perimeter. Unable to climb faster than 400 feet/min (123 meters/min) or 4.5 mi/h (7.5 km/h), these men were overtaken by the flames in probably less than 45 seconds before they had covered more than 100 yards (92 meters) beyond the perimeter of Dodge's escape fire.\nFour of the firefighters reached further up the slope to a distance of about 375 yards (345 (meters) beyond the escape fire before they were engulfed in the flames. This suggests that they may have been in advance of Dodge before be ignited his grass fire. These firefighters ran perhaps 620 (570 meters) after casting off their equipment at the drop site, jogging upslope at 460 feet/min (142 meters/min) or 5.3 mi/h (8.4 km/h), an astonishing rate to maintain on an 18% grade over rough terrain.\nOne smokejumper, Stanley J. Reba broke a leg in his effort to escape the flames, a measure of how steep and treacherous the footing.\n\n\n=== Survivors ===\nOf the four firefighters who fled from Dodge to scramble the 100 – 140 yards (92 – 129 meters) straight to the ridge top, two survived: Robert Sallee and Walter Ramsey. The 17-year old Sallee mistakenly thought that Dodge's intent was to create a firebreak to slow the advance of the main fire. He, Ramsey and Diettert ascended to the right (east) of the growing escape blaze as it moved upslope. (Figure 2)\nApproaching the crest, these three firefighters encountered a 6 to 12 foot high (1.8 to 3.7 meter) wall of rimrock or \"reef\" that blocked access to the top of the ridge. Ramsey and Salle were fortunate to notice a breach or crevice in the rimrock and ran through it to the ridge. Ramsey testified that he could feel the intense heat of the main fire on his back as they neared the top of the ridge. Diettert, just steps behind them, either did not see the crevice or chose to search elsewhere to cross over. His remains were found a hundred yards (92 meters) eastward at the base of the reef.\nThe squad leader, Hellman, ascended the slope parallel to these three firefighters, but on the left (west) side of the escape fire. He was forced to run a gauntlet of flames as he reached the rimrock barrier, but managed to pass over the ridge into Rescue Gulch.\nMoments before the main fire reached Dodge, he threw himself face down on the smoldering ashes of the escape fire. His mouth and nose were covered with a wet bandanna. The slope he had burned was ample enough in area so as to shield him from injury from heat radiation or from direct contact with the flames of the main fire. He was almost lifted from his prone position several times by powerful gusts of superheated air during the few minutes it took the inferno to pass.\n\nSallee and Ramsey fled into Rescue Gulch. Ramsey momentarily collapsed from exhaustion but with Sallee's urging they reached a downslope blockfield largely free of vegetation that afforded them some protection as the main fire continued over the ridge to burn downslope past them.\n6:10 pm – Dodge rose from the smoldering escape fire, his face and clothing blackened by the smoke, but otherwise virtually unscathed. All twelve of the crewmen who failed to reach the ridge perished in the inferno. Had they been able to grasp what their foreman was doing, or obeyed his commands, they probably would have survived.\nDodge found the badly injured Joseph B. Sylvia just 100 yards (30 meters) to the east of the escape fire. He made Sylvia as comfortable as he could and provided him with water. Dodge departed to seek medical assistance for him.\nSallee and Ramsey discovered the badly burned Hellman just 90 feet (28 meters) west of their position and helped him to the blockfield. Dodge joined them shortly thereafter, and he and Salle descended Rescue Gulch to the Missouri River. Ramsey remained with Hellman.\n8:50 pm – Dodge and Sallee reached the Meriwether Guard Station after flagging down a boat and radioed for assistance.\n11:30 pm – Two medical doctors from St. Peters Hospital in Helena were escorted up Rescue Gulch by Dodge and Sallee. Sylvia and Hellman were administered plasma and morphine and their wounds dressed.\n6 August 1949\nDaylight – The two injured smokejumpers were carried by stretcher to the mouth of Mann Gulch and transported by boat to St. Peters Hospital in Helena. Both Sylvia and Hellman had suffered third degree burns over 65% to 85% of their bodies, as well as severe damage to their respiratory systems. They both died later that morning.\nThe eleven other smokejumpers – Robert Bennett, Eldon Diettert, Phillip McVey, David Navon, Leonard Piper, Stanley Reba, Marvin Sherman, Henry Thol Jr., Newton Thompson, and Silas Thompson, as well as recreation guard James Harrison are believed to have succumbed quickly from asphyxiation and burns they suffered shortly after 6:00 pm on 5 August.\n\n\n== Findings ==\n\n\n=== Casualties ===\n\nThose that were killed by the fire:\n\nRobert J.

        "content": "On May 23, 2006, the May 23, 2006 Democratic Alliance for Change (ADC) simultaneously mutinied in the cities of Kidal and Ménaka, sparking the 2006 Tuareg rebellion. The mutinies were the first and only major action of the rebellion, which came to an end in the July 2006 Algiers Accords.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn the 1990's, Tuareg rebels fought the Malian government over alleged discrimination by southern Malians against Tuaregs from the north in a six-year long rebellion that ended in 1996 with Tuareg rebels being integrated into the Malian Armed Forces. One of the catalysts of the peace agreement during the 1990s was tensions between Ifoghas Tuaregs from northern Mali and Imghad Tuaregs, considered a sub-clan. These groups splintered and reformed often, and neither could explicitly defeat one another or the Malian Army. El Hadj Ag Gamou, an staunchly pro-Malian Imghad Tuareg who was defeated by Ifoghas Tuaregs in the 90s was promoted to the commander of the Malian garrison in Gao over Ifoghas leader Hassan Ag Fagaga. In response, Fagaga and other prominent Ifoghas like Iyad Ag Ghaly and Ibrahim Ag Bahanga created a group called the May 23, 2006 Democratic Alliance for Change (ADC) to desire more autonomy in Kidal Region and among Ifoghas Tuaregs.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nUnder Fagaga's leadership, 150 Malian Tuareg officers mutinied from their posts in Kidal, Menaka, and Tessalit. The Tuareg officers subjugated pro-Malian colleagues starting around 5 in the morning, and quickly captured the camps at Kidal and Menaka. Seventy-five deserters took part in the attack at Kidal, and both Fagaga and Bahanga were present in the city. Fagaga stated later that two soldiers were killed each on the pro-government and ADC sides, and that Ghaly joined the insurgents later that day.\nIn Menaka, the town's commander Ba Ag Moussa looted his unit's weaponry and fled to the Adrar des Ifoghas mountains in northern Kidal Region to meet up with other ADC members. Other officers in Tessalit also stole weaponry and fled to the Adrar des Ifoghas. All three camps were deserted during the night between May 23 and 24, 2006.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nFollowing the attack, Fagaga called for a \"special status\" for Kidal Region, and Ghaly took the reins of the rebellion. Negotiations between the ADC and the Malian and Nigerien governments began immediately after the attack, and the Ifergenoussen sub-clan of Ifoghas Tuaregs (of whom Fagaga and Bahanga belonged to) were the heart of the new rebellion. The rebellion came to an end in July 2006 with the Algiers Accords of 2006, which promised to uphold the 1996 peace agreement and develop Kidal Region.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Avi Adham Aborumi (Arabic: إبراهيم ادهم (افي) ابورومي; born January 16, 1995) is an Arab-Israeli singer and actor of Muslim origin who converted to Israeli.\n\n\n== Life ==\nBorn into an Arab-Muslim family. Under the name Abraham Aburomi (ابراهيم ابورومي), he grew up in Eilat where his parents moved from Shfaram and Nazareth. His parents raised him without religion, and the language spoken in their home was also Hebrew. In Eilat, Naeltz was educated in Hebrew-speaking environments, although he later learned literary Arabic. He said that not all Islamic holidays were celebrated in his house.\nWhen he was 14, his father died of cancer and so, as a young man, Aborumi began working to help support his family.\nWhen he reached draft age, Aburomi asked to enlist in the IDF. At first he was offered to volunteer only, due to his Arab origin and his family's Muslim religion, but he insisted on enlisting for reasons related to belonging and the desire to contribute. According to him: \"I wanted to be like everyone else.\" He served in the Transport Corps [clarification needed] and later served as a military commander of Mkam soldiers at the Negev Guard base.\nDuring his service, he said he went through a military conversion process through the Nativ course, and with the end of the process, he adopted another name, Adham.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAburomi began his musical career in 2014, uploading sketches of songs he wrote and composed to the YouTube website when in June 2015 he uploaded the song \"Tedai Lech\" to the network for the first time and in September 2016 he released it in a studio version .\nIn 2021 he released his debut album \"A Reason to Breathe\" when the songs from the album were released as singles between 2015 and 2021. The album includes the song \"Lovavi\" dedicated to Amit Ben Yigal, who was killed in combat on May 12, 2020.\nIn 2022, Aburomi released the hit \"tell everything\", which was his breakthrough song, placing fifth in the annual anthem parade \"The Diez\" of the Broadcasting Corporation's Kaan Gimel radio station. At this show, Aburomi even won the \"Breakthrough of the Year\" award. Additionally, it also won this title at Ynet's Froggie's Choice of the Year Awards.\nThat same year he released the song \"What's on your mind\", which was also a hit.\nIn 2023 he released the single \"We Are No More\" together with singer Mor Shaveti. The song was played many times and reached the top of the \"Top Ten\" list of Broadcasting Corporation radio station Kaan Gimel.\nIn June 2023, Aburomi won the Acomm Award for Achievement of the Year for a Composer. In the reasons for the award, the contest judges wrote: \"In a short period of time, Aburomi managed to put on a chart and. He has the future ahead of him and it sounds promising\".

        "content": "The Swiss Farmers' Union (SFU; until 2013 Schweizerischer Bauernverband; French: Union Suisse des Paysans (USP), Italian: Unione Svizzera dei Contadini (USC), Romansh: Uniun Purila Svizra (UPS) represents the interests of the farming community in Switzerland as an umbrella organization and is considered one of the most influential organizations in the country.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe association was established in 1897 in Bern Town Hall. Its co-founders were Johann Jenny and Caspar Decurtins. Three years later, the association's headquarters were relocated from Bern to Brugg, as the wife of the association's director, Ernst Laur, was from there and was unwilling to relocate to Bern. Another influential figure in the early years was Fritz Zaugg. Over time, the modest Farmers' Secretariat (Schweizerisches Bauernsekretariat; SBS for short) evolved into a sizable association with over 80 permanent employees through the establishment of new departments. In 1941, the Swiss Rural Women's Association joined the SFU. In 1937, the SFU was pivotal in establishing the Agricultural Information Service (AIS). In 1947, a placement office for agricultural workers and trainees was established. Workers were initially recruited mainly from Italy, and later from Spain, Portugal, and Yugoslavia. In the mid-1970s, the Swiss Confederation transferred the central evaluation of accounting results to the Swiss Confederation's Center of Excellence for Agricultural Research in Tänikon. As a result, the SFU was reorganized in 1979 and the SBS was dissolved. The focus shifted to influencing the legislative process in favor of agriculture and providing services to members. In 1981, the Small Farmers' Association was accepted as a section, before leaving in 1982 due to differences over the Small Farmers' Initiative.\nIn 1995, the association began offering Internet services under the name agri.ch. After a Management buyout, the company became green.ch in 2001.\n\n\n== Organization and objectives ==\nThe association is composed of representatives of 25 cantonal farmers' associations and 60 agricultural umbrella and specialized organizations (21 from the animal production sector, 13 from the crop production sector, 4 cooperative associations, and 22 from other sectors; as of November 2023).\nThe affiliated sub-associations represent some 49,000 farms. They elect 500 members to the Assembly of Delegates, which defines the goals of the association and makes fundamental decisions. The delegates elect a 100-member Chamber of Agriculture (LAKA), which is responsible for securing income, making submissions to the authorities, and supervising management. The Board of Directors consists of 18 to 21 members. It deals with the day-to-day business of the Association, forms specialist commissions, and appoints the members of the Secretariat.\nSFU Director Martin Rufer and his deputy Urs Schneider can lobby directly in the Federal Palace. They were granted access to the parliament building by SFU President and National Councillor Markus Ritter. Ritter is the first organic farmer to hold this position. Among the more than 40 \"farmer parliamentarians\" of the Swiss Farmers' Association are Charles Juillard, a member of the Council of States, Leo Müller, a member of the National Council, and Nicolò Paganini, a member of the National Council and chairman of the Board of Directors of the Migros Cooperative Eastern Switzerland.\nThe SFU has set itself the following goals To provide a range of services to farmers, to preserve the family farm, to provide farmers with an adequate income, to influence the legal framework, to use the land wisely, to produce quality products through transparent production processes and designations of origin, to protect cultivated land and to preserve nature.\nTo achieve these goals, the SFU operates various service companies, including Agrimpuls (Job placement), Agriprof (Education), Agriexpert (Fiduciary services, Legal and Valuation issues), the Agricultural Construction and Architecture Firm LBA, and the Agrisano Companies. The latter are five legally and economically independent companies (Agrisano Foundation, Agrisano Health Insurance Ltd., Agrisano Insurance Ltd., Agrisano Previous, and Agrisano Pencas) that work together to offer farming families and their employees self-developed personal insurance solutions tailored to their needs. Agrisano works closely with the cantonal Agricultural Professional Organizations, which operate regional offices for Agrisano.\n\n\n== Financing ==\nThe Farmers' Union is financed two-thirds by income from its services and one-third by contributions from its member sections. These contributions are paid directly or indirectly by the farming families and amount to approximately CHF 100.-- to CHF 150.-- per family per year, depending on the size of the farm. The farm families' contributions are divided 3:2 into area contributions and production contributions. The reason for this division is that it takes into account both the area cultivated and the added value of the various branches of production. The Assembly of Delegates votes annually on the area contributions and also decides every four years on the product contributions, which are adjusted to the current share of final production.\nThe most recent decision of the Assembly of Delegates adjusted the amount of product-related contributions at the beginning of 2018. The product-related contributions were recalculated based on final production and resulted in some significant changes for individual member sections. At the same time, the SFU adjusted the representation rights in the committees.\nThe Swiss Vegetable Producers Association (VSGP) did not accept the decision of the Delegates Assembly and decided at the end of February 2018 to withdraw from the SFU with retroactive effect from January 1, 2018.\n\n\n== Positions ==\n\n\n=== Agricultural policy 22+ ===\nThe Farmers' Union welcomes the suspension of the 22+ agricultural policy, which the SFU believes offers no prospects for farming families and is immature.\n\n\n=== Animal welfare ===\nAccording to the association, animal welfare is very important to them. It therefore advocates clear enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act - the association also opposes the slaughter of pregnant cows and cattle. According to Martin Rufer of the SFU, sanctions against slaughterhouses are more effective than fines. However, the association is in favor of factory farming and opposed the federal popular initiative \"For a natural farmer - against animal factories (small farmers' initiative)\". It also opposes the federal popular initiative \"No to factory farming in Switzerland\", which will be put to the vote on September 25, 2022. In addition, the SFU is committed to ensuring that direct payments to farmers (approximately CHF 2.8 billion per year) are not reduced, as the majority of these payments are tied to public services. However, the SFU is a member of the Proviande trade association.\n\n\n== Statements ==\n\n\n=== CO2 Act ===\nAfter a controversial debate, the Chamber of Agriculture voted in favor of the CO2 law by 56 votes to 19, with 9 abstentions.\n\n\n=== Pesticide initiatives ===\nAccording to the Farmers' Union, sustainable agriculture is very important to them. However, the Swiss Farmers' Union is fighting the initiatives on drinking water and pesticides - both of which will be put to the vote on June 13, 2021 - because it believes they go far beyond the goal. According to SFU deputy director Urs Schneider, this is the biggest campaign in the 125-year history of the Swiss Farmers' Union. Schneider is coordinating the 2x NO campaign.\n\n\n=== Referendum against free trade agreement with Indonesia ===\nThe Farmers' Union supported the Free Trade Agreement with Indonesia in the referendum on March 7, 2021.\n\n\n=== Corporate Responsibility Initiative ===\nThe Chamber of Agriculture has decided to vote against the Corporate Responsibility Initiative.\n\n\n== Board members ==\nThe 24-member SFU board is heavily dominated by the Swiss People's Party (SVP) and includes the following members in addition to SFU President Markus Ritter (The Center):\n\n\n== Presidents since 1897 ==\n\n\n== Directors since 1897 ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWebsite of the Swiss Farmers' Union\nSchweizer Bauernverband in the Archive for Agricultural History\nWerner Baumann: Schweizerischer Bauernverband (SBV).

        "content": "Eugene Stock (1836-1928), was an author, historian, journal editor and senior editorial secretary at the Church Missionary Society in London. Stock is best known for his four-volume work, The history of the Church Missionary Society , published in 1899, which is considered the most thorough account of the history of the Church Missionary Society (CMS) and the many missions it had reign over..\n\n\n== Early life ==\nEugene Stock was born on February 26, 1836 in Westminster, London, during the short reign of  William IV, when he was King of Hanover. After completing his basic education  in London and Brighton public schools he continued with his studies and largely taught himself without the aid of a university or clerical background that secretaries of his caliber were generally known to possess..His first memories of English royalty began when he was a youth during the reign of Queen Victoria. Stock was the eldest child of his father through his first marriage, and was born in a home on Dule Street in Westminster.Because of an unstable circumstances the Stock family never had much of a  change to settle into a permanent house  His mother died when he was about ten years old. His earliest memories are of a ferry ride with his mother to the Isle of Wight from Portsmouth on the southern coast of England.\n\nLittle else  is known about his boyhood years, or his parents, as there were very few surviving family letters and no boyhood friends who outlived him. Subsequently there are only two primary sources from which to draw upon for this information. .One is Stock's occasional references to his boyhood memories and those of various incidents that had occurred then, and which were were only made occasionally  to friends and relatives and friends. Other sources include a series of papers that Stock made when he was about seventy years of age for one of the church weekly papers, which were later further expanded, and published in a volume now out of print. Much of this information was covered in Stock's 1909 publication, My Recollections, which was not an attempt at an autobiography, but is a work outlining the notable evens in his life, and which only contains one chapter of Stock's earlier years, to which he wrote:\n\n\"These Recollections are not intended to form an autobiography, and I have no thought of putting into print the uninteresting details of my personal life. But to note a few leading facts seems necessary, in order to make the following chapters intelligible.\" \nStock's father was a man of position and wealth, who was often in France where he lost his entire fortune was wiped out  through speculations on the French Bourse. His mother was a highly educated and accomplished lady, whose assets and property were almost entirely lost in the same manner. His mother was left with Stock and his two sisters whom she struggled to provided for with what little was left of  her remaining fortune.\n\n\n== Career ==\nStock joined the Church Missionary Society as an editor in 1873 and soon became its editorial secretary in 1875, supervisor of its its publications, including its influential journal,  The Intelligence'r. Throughout the 1880s his influence grew.\nStock’s four volume History of the Church Missionary Society  (1899-1916) is considered his greatest work, and the most thorough account of missionary history writing in the in nineteenth century, providing many insights into the missionaries and missionary life in the nineteenth-century \nHenry Venn one of the founders of the Church Missionary Society had  a significant influence on Stock and his views on missionary life. However, there is speculation that Stock may have been subjugated by his own immediate surroundings and experiences that  apparently made him abandon some of Venn's positions regarding missionary work in underdeveloped foreign lands with the idea that such efforts would have been better directed at his own countrymen and other European countries.\nStock was an outspoken critic of Robert Needham Cust who was active in the British and Foreign Bible Society and who tended to alienate himself for his criticism of the CMS for their abandonment of some of Venn's policies. Stock subsequently described Cust as “inconsistent, cantankerous and far too liberal\".\n\n\n== Later years ==\nBecause of declining health Stock was compelled to resign his position as editorial secretary in 1902. He remained a CMS secretary without pay until his retirement in 1906. Thereafter he was appointed a vice-president to the society and regularly attended the general committee for twelve more years. He continued as one of the most influential advocate of foreign missions. At age sixty-six Stock married Isabella Emily Fiennes, a widow, on August 20 1902, at Saint Saviour’s Church in South Hampstead, London.  In 1908 he was awarded an honorary degree of DCL by the University of Durham. As a result of an accident with an automobile he soon died on September 7, 1928 at his home in Bournemouth, and was buried in Bournemouth cemetery.\n\n\n== Works ==\nStock, Eugene (1899).

        "content": "The Lander Journal is a bi-weekly newspaper published in Lander, Wyoming. It serves the Lander area and has been a part of the local media landscape under the ownership of Riverton Ranger Inc.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe paper has been in existence under different names since the early days of Lander, beginning around 1908. The name Lander Journal was adopted in the 1990s, but previously it was called the Wyoming State Journal and the Lander Wyoming State Journal.  From the 1970s to the early 1990s, the paper was published by Bill Sniffen and was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in 1991.\nIn 1999, the Lander Journal was acquired by the Riverton Ranger from Bill and Nancy Sniffin. Steve Peck of the Riverton Ranger managed the newspaper from 1999 until 2022, when the publications were sold to Grace Andrus, a local financial adviser. However, a month after Andrus purchased the papers, they were sold again in February 2022 to the Edwards Group, who currently own and manage them.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nrivertonranger.com/lander_journal/",

        "content": "Arryo del Valle Sanatrium, originally opened as Del Valle Preventorium, was a sanitarium located in Livermore, California, United States that specialized in the treatment of tuberculosis. The hospital campus originally spanned over 160 acres. Upon opening in 1918, the hospital had a capacity of 280 patients. This was later expanded to 300. The buildings were designed by architect Henry H. Meyers of San Francisco.  Originally opened as a private institution, Alameda County took over operations of the hospital in 1925.\nIn 1919, Dr. Chessley Bush was named medical superintendent of the sanitarium. He held the position for more than 30 years.\nIn 1923, Del Valle Farm was opened next to the sanatorium as a children's tuberculosis ward. The farm was eventually incorporated into the sanitarium in the 1920s. In 1949, James T. Duncan named the medical superintendent of the sanitarium until its closure. He had previously served as the director of Stony Brook Sanatorium in Kern County before moving to Livermore.\nThe sanitarium went into decline after after Streptomycin became the main treatment for tuberculosis during the 1940s and 1950s. By 1959, the sanitarium only had 148 patients. Closure of the asylum commenced on July 1, 1960, after authorization of the Alameda County Board of Supervisors, with the last patients being removed in August 1960. Upon closure the remaining 90 patients were moved to the tuberculosis ward at Fairmont Hospital in San Leandro.\n\n\n== Post-closure ==\nThe asylum sat abandoned for a number of years after 1960, with the land being maintained by Alameda County. Heavy rains collapsed the upper floors of many buildings. A majority of the windows were knocked out over the years. Vandalism and theft were common on the grounds and several buildings were burned down.\nIn 1976, a nonprofit organization named Buenas Vidas Youth Ranch leased part of the asylum grounds to use as center for their activities. The organization was a youth counselling group focused on youths aged 12–21. Volunteers cleaned up part of the campus grounds and also renovated one of the buildings near the main entrance, renaming it the \"Rienecker House\" after a Livermore High School student who was killed in an automobile accident the previous year. By 1987, Buenas Vidas had renovated another buildings which they used for camp activates. In 1988 concerns were brought forward about continued ranch operations due to asbestos in  the buildings. By 1989, the grounds were acquired by the East Bay Regional Park District.\nDuring the 1990s, the buildings were demolished and a summer camp named Camp Arroyo was constructed on the former grounds. The camp is run by the East Bay Regional Park District.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIn 1973, a horror movie named Warlock Moon was filmed on the grounds.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of hospitals in California\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Argentina Palace (Portuguese: Palacete Argentina) is a historic building located in the Brazilian city of Porto Alegre, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. It is a heritage site listed by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN).\n\n\n== History ==\nArgentina Palace is an eclectic-style building erected in 1901 for Sebastião de Barros. It passed to his daughter, Manoelita Lilia Etzenberger, when she married Alceu Otacílio Barbedo. The project was designed by Theóphilo Borges de Barros and executed by the Tomatis Brothers. Later, it was sold to Franklin Etzberger. In 1928, it underwent a renovation in which arches supported by Solomonic columns were opened in some walls. A tea room, a winter garden and service rooms were also added to the lower floor. The current name originated when it was occupied by the Argentina School Group in 1940.\nIn 1971, the Rio Grande do Sul State Government declared the property to be of public utility and expropriated it. In 1984 it underwent restoration by IPHAN, which installed its regional headquarters in the building and listed it as a heritage site in 1990. The building has two floors and a basement. It preserves rich ornamental decoration on the facade. Originally, the interior was luxurious with mural paintings, stained glass windows, wood carvings and other sophisticated adornments. It belongs to a limited group of buildings of a similar size that remain on the area, which used to be an elite residential neighborhood.\nIn 2003, it underwent a preservation renovation sponsored by IPHAN and the Southern Regional Office of the Ministry of Culture (MINc). The work, under the command of Ana Meira, ended in 2006 and cost R$ 440,000. It included repairs to plastering, stained glass windows, the facade of the house and the electrical network.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of Porto Alegre\nArchitecture of Porto Alegre\nArchitecture of Brazil\n\n\n== References ==",

He began his career as a 2nd lieutenant in the Kenyan Air Force and received training as a fighter pilot with the US Air Force. In 2018, he became Commander of the Kenya Air Force and later Vice Chief of Defence Forces. He was appointed Chief of Defence Forces by President William Ruto after the retirement of General Robert Kariuki Kibochi in April 2023. At the time, Ogolla's appointment raised controversy after the head of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission accused him of being part of a national security council delegation that tried to influence the result of the 2022 general election against the eventual winner, Ruto, who defended Ogolla citing his qualifications. \nOgolla studied and graduated from the École Militaire de Paris, the National Defence College of Kenya, Egerton University and the University of Nairobi.  He was a recipient of several awards, including the Elder of the Order of the Golden Heart of Kenya (EGH) and Chief of the Order of the Burning Spear (CBS).\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOgolla was married to Aileen and had two children and a grandchild.\n\n\n== Death ==\nOgolla died in a helicopter crash on 18 April 2024 in Sindar, Elgeyo-Marakwet County at 2:20 pm. Nine other military personnel also died, while two were injured. The aircraft was a Bell UH-1H Huey II operated by the 53 Tactical Helicopter Squadron of the Kenyan Air Force. The crash occurred while they were on a mission to reopen schools in the North Rift region following bandit attacks and to inspect soldiers involved in stabilisation operations.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nPresident William Ruto declared three days of national mourning for his death, beginning on 19 April. Condolences were also expressed by former president Uhuru Kenyatta, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, and President of Somalia's Jubaland State, Ahmed Mohamed Islam.\n\n\n== References ==",

The defending class champion was Josh Herrin, who vacated his title during 2023 to race in MotoAmerica Superbike. \n\n\n== Introduction of Extended Race Format ==\nFor the 2023 Supersport championship season, MotoAmerica piloted an extended race distance concept at the Barber Motorsports Park and Laguna Seca events. The extended races were double the distance the Supersport sprint races; therefore, worth double the points. The extended race mileage required the teams to make a pistop of minimum prescribed time to refuel the bike and make tire changes.  Xavi Fores and the Warhorse HSBK Ducati team won both of the extended Supersport races during the 2023 season. \n\n\n== Josh Hayes Achieves Record AMA Career Wins ==\nDuring the 2022 Supersport season, Josh Hayes tied Miguel Duhamel's record for all-time career wins in AMA Pro Road Racing by taking a double victory at New Jersey Motorsports Park.  An unfortunate injury at Barber Motorsports Park during the final round of the 2022 season, ended Hayes' attempt for the record during the 2022 season,  but Hayes returned for another season of Supersport competition with the SquidHunter Racing Team for 2023.  On July 29th, 2023, Hayes took victory in Race 1 at Brainerd International Raceway to score his 87th career victory, taking sole possession of the record for career wins in AMA Pro Road Racing competition. Hayes added his 88th career win in the final race of the 2023 season at New Jersey Motorsports Park. \n\n\n== Calendar and results ==\n\n\n== Teams and riders ==\n\n\n== Championship standings ==\n\nScoring system\nPoints are awarded to the top fifteen finishers. A rider has to finish the race to earn points.\n\n\n== References ==",

The earthquake was felt over a broad area due to its location. Parts of the US such as the District of Columbia, and parts of Ontario, Canada. The earthquake generated relatively high accelerations (0.18 g) of short duration at the Perry plant. Thirteen aftershocks were detected in the following weeks, with six occurring within the first 8 days. Two of the aftershocks were felt. Magnitudes for the aftershocks ranged from about 0.5 to 2.5. Focal depths for all of the earthquakes ranged from 2 to 6 km. Except for one small earthquake, all of the aftershocks occurred in a very tight cluster with a north-northeast orientation.\n\n\n== Earthquake ==\nThe earthquake had a moment magnitude of 5.0 and a depth of 6 km (4 mi). Its epicenter was 40 km east of the city of Cleveland, but its exact location could not be found. Tremors were felt all across the Eastern United States, from Virginia to Northern Canada.\nFew aftershocks were reported within the next weeks, but they were relatively weak, with the strongest being reported had a magnitude of 2.5 No damage was reported.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of earthquakes in the United States\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Askia Muhammad Gao was the last ruler of the Songhai Empire, son of Askia Daud. He assumed power in the last months of 1591 after the defeat of Askia Ishaq II by Moroccan forces. Yet in the same year, about forty days after taking power, he was lured into a trap and killed by the Moroccans.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Before assuming power ===\nMuhammad Gao was one of the many sons of Askia Daud, who ruled in Songhai from 1549 to 1582. While during Daud's life the empire was stable and orderly, after his death, numerous descendants began to vie for power. Muhammad Gao took part in the Kurmina-fari Al-Hajj conspiracy against Askia Al-Hajj, but he changed sides along with his other brothers and turned against the rebel. During the reign of Askia Ishaq II, the Moroccan invasion occurred, finding Muhammad Gao in the position of balamy. As a holder of this title, he was one of the highest commanders of the Songhai army and the governor of the Dyina province. Traditionally, the balamy garrison was stationed at the port of Karaba near Timbuktu. Askia Ishaq II lost the first major battle against the forces of Moroccan Pasha Judar at Tondibi. The Sultan of Morocco rejected Askia's peace proposal and sent another expedition led by Pasha Mahmud ben Zergun. The decisive battle he waged against Ishaq II took place on the Niger River, near the town of Bamba, where the Songhai army was again defeated. Muhammad Gao participated in the fighting against the pasha's troops. During the retreat after the lost battle, he was shot with a musket, resulting in an illness.\n\n\n=== Assumption of Askia's title ===\nDefeated Ishaq II gathered a unit of 1,200 elite horsemen and ordered his hi-koi (chief naval commander), Laha, to strike at the stationed pasha in the town of Kukia. Muhammad Gao was supposed to join this unit, leading a 100 cavalrymen. The soldiers proclaimed Muhammad as the new Askia, while Ishaq II fled to the Gurma province, where he was killed. Another version of the story suggests that the battle itself took place in Gurma, and immediately afterward Askia Ishaq fled, ultimately meeting his death at the hands of the Tuaregs. In this case, Muhammad Gao's assumption of power would have a different context. One of the new Askia's first actions was to free two of his brothers imprisoned by Askia Muhammad Bani – fari-mundio Tafa and benga-farma Nuh.\n\n\n=== Moroccan trickery ===\nSome of Muhammad Gao's brothers, led by Suleiman, began to defect to the side of the invaders. To prevent the fragmentation of the state, the new Askia initiated peace negotiations through his secretary Bukar Lanbar with the pasha Mahmud. Due to hunger among Mahmud's ranks, he asked Muhammad for food assistance, which he agreed to provide. The pasha declared that a condition for peace was the personal oath of allegiance to the Moroccans by Askia and his dignitaries. Despite numerous doubts and warnings, especially from hi-koi Laha, Muhammad Gao agreed to these terms, encouraged by the assurances given by his secretary. Mahmud ben Zergun held a reception for the arriving guests, during which he ordered the imprisonment of all Songhai people except Bukar, raising suspicions that he was complicit. Askia and his 18 dignitaries were transported to Gao and then executed on the pasha's orders. Michel suggests that the initiator of bringing Askia was Qaid Mami. He suggested to Muhammad that, as a gesture of goodwill in peace negotiations, he should provide food to the starving residents of Timbuktu. When Askia arrived with supplies, he and his entourage were murdered on Mahmud's orders, who sought to avenge losses suffered by the Moroccans during the crossing of the Sahara. The reign of Askia is estimated to have lasted for forty days.\n\n\n== Successors ==\nAfter the death of Askia Muhammad Gao, Songhai officially split into two warring factions. In place of the slain Muhammad, the army chose Nuh, who had been freed by Muhammad, as the new Askia. He managed to evacuate many Songhai people from the areas controlled by Morocco. With them, he went to Dendi, giving rise to a new, diminished kingdom. Mahmud ben Zergun decided to appoint a new Askia to calm the Songhai people. The chosen one was another son of Askia Daud, Suleiman, who was the first to acknowledge the authority of the Moroccans.\n\n\n== Family tree ==\nAskia Muhammad Gao was the son of Askia Daud and the grandson of the founder of the Askia dynasty, Muhammad I. Due to the large number of sons of Askia Muhammad I and Askia Daud, the family tree is limited to the reigning members of the Songhai dynasty (highlighted in green). Among Muhammad Gao's other brothers, rulers of the Dendi kingdom can be mentioned, such as Askia Nuh, Askia Al-Mustafa, Askia Muhammad Sorko, Askia Harun, and Askia Al-Amin, as well as Askia Pashaliku Arm Suleiman.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nTymowski, Michał (1979).

        "content": "In economics, the paradox of banknotes or cash paradox is the observation that while the share of cash transactions has fallen over the past few decades due to alternative forms of payment such as credit cards and other electronic payment instruments, the demand for physical currency, measured as the ratio of currency in circulation (CIC) to GDP, has been steadily increasing since the early 2000s.  This phenomenon contradicts the standard monetary model, wherein cash demand and use of cash in transactions are positively correlated .\nFirst coined in 2009 by then Chief Cashier of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, the paradox of banknotes originates with the increase in the CIC/GDP ratio in the early 2000's after, decades long decline in cash demand beginning in the 1940's. While first identified and described in the circulation of the British Pound Sterling, the phenomenon is wide spread among a variety of currencies; between 2001 and 2019, the CIC/GDP ratio increased in 98 out of the 128 countries available within the International Financial Statistics Database of the International Monetary Fund.\nThe paradox of cash was further exacerbated and accelerated during the Covid-19 pandemic. An increased in demand for physical currency was present throughout 2020, despite a decrease of cash transactions and changing consumer payment habits associated with the pandemic. Out of the 128 countries within the IMF database, CIC increased by an average 18.7% in 2020, even with a  3.1% decrease in global GDP during the same time period.\n\n\n== Hypothesized causes ==\n\n\n=== Money as a store of value ===\nWhile the use of cash as a medium of exchange, has been declining over the past few decades, the increase in demand for banknotes has been hypothesized to be associated with an increase demand for currency as a store of value.\n\n\n==== Increased demand for cash in turbulent markets and times of crisis ====\nEmpirical studies suggest that during times of crisis, regardless of the category of crisis, demand for banknotes significantly increase. During times of financial crisis the attractiveness of physical currency as a relatively low-risk store of value increases. This increased demand is especially pronounced in large denomination bills during banking crisis where confidence in financial institutions decreases; such was the case during the Great Recession where the value notes in circulation of the USD increased by 10.6%, the Euro by 18.8%, while  GDP declined by 4.3% and 4.0% respectively.\nThe effect on CIC/GDP ratio is particularly strong in times of financial recession, especially if the permanent income hypothesis holds and households maintain excess cash reserves according to their permanent income rather than falling current income; as GDP decreases through the recession and cash demand through household reserves increase simultaneously, the CIC/GDP ratio will increase despite lower economic activity.\nFurther studies have shown, market turbulence and unpredictability increases the attractiveness of cash as a store of wealth. Similarly to decreasing confidence in financial institution during times of financial crisis, market unpredictability lowers yields of alternative investments such as equity or bonds, an further increases risk of those investments. Market turbulence thus makes low-risk low-return assets, such as cash, relatively more attractive, especially to risk adverse agents. Therefore as market unpredictability, often brought on by times of crisis, increases, the demand for cash increases. The prevalence of consistent market turbulence over the past two decades, brought on by events such as the Dot Com Bubble, Great Recession, and Covid-19 pandemic, have thus increased demand for cash in spite of GDP movement.\nThe demand and holding of smaller denomination bills for transactional purposes have also been shown to increase during times of crisis and especially during natural disasters as the confidence in and availability of electronic payment instruments decrease.\n\n\n==== Increased use of cash as a store of value in low interest markets ====\nThe demand for cash as a store of value has been shown to be inversely correlated with low interest rates; as the earnings of alternative higher-risk investments decline, the appeal of holding low-risk low-return assets, such as cash, increases. John Maynard Keynes describes this concept as the speculative demand for money. Within the same period that the demand for money as ratio of CIC/GDP has increased, global average interest rates have declined since it's highs in the 1980's, to historic lows in the mid 2010's. While the decline in interest rates, especially following the 2008 recession has contributed to increased cash demands, it is not wholly responsible for the rise in money demand.\n\n\n==== Foreign demand for bank notes as reserve currency ====\nThere is significant overlap between currencies for which the paradox of banknotes is most pronounced and those used most as reserve currency by foreign governments. In particular beginning in the early 2000's China's foreign reserves have exponentially grown to nearly twenty times it's pre-2000's level; this trend can be seen in many other countries which have run a trade surplus over the past two decades. The share of USD held as foreign reserves and within foreign individuals have increased from 36.4% to 44.7% in the same time period, with similar trends occurring for the Euro with an estimated 30-50% of Euro notes being held by foreign entities. These increases in share of currency held by foreign entities can partial offset it's decrease use as a medium of exchange.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Bargi is a mountain hamlet of 44 inhabitants, in the municipality of Camugnano, in the metropolitan city of Bologna. The hamlet is located in the Tuscan-Emilian Apennines, at an altitude of 674 meters above sea level. Among the hamlets of the municipality of Camugnano it is the penultimate in terms of population.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first human settlements in this area date back to the Bronze Age, there is no specific information on Bargi, but there is a possibility that the area was inhabited until then, as axes, axes and votive statuettes dated precisely to this age. Even in the age relating to the Etruscans there is no specific information on Bargi, but in the nearby town of Carpineta, shards and a bronze head of a bull were found.\nBetween the 6th and 8th centuries the border between Tuscia and the Exarchate of Ravenna passed in the territory of Bargi. In the 10th century, with the establishment of the feudal regime, Bargi was initially controlled by the Counts Alberti of Prato, but shortly after it became a territory of constant war between the Stagnesi, supported by the Pistoia people, and the Bolognese government. In the mid-13th century a peace pact was signed between the people of Pistoia and Bologna, but in 1306 the castle of Stagno was conquered by the Counts of Panico. Their dominion did not last long and possession of the castle, as well as that of the surrounding areas, passed into the hands of the Bolognese. In 1451 the castle of Bargi was destroyed by Baldazzo d'Anghieri, the pope's ally against Bologna. In 1789, under the laws of the new state, Bargi was subjected to the municipality of Casio and finally to the municipality of Camugnano.\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\nThe Palazzo Comelli complex is located in the historic village of Casa Melati, at the head of the long staircases and overlooking Lake Suviana, it is also part of the regional park of the Suviana and Brasimone lakes. The building was built in medieval times in the style of the Comacine masters and was subsequently transformed into a palace by the Comelli family of notaries. The Comellis lived there until the end of the 20th century, and Gianbattista Comelli was the last to live there permanently. Since 2004 the building has been owned by the municipality and was the subject of a restyling project in 2005. It is now part of the Camugnano Ecomuseum and has been reopened to the public since 2014. The complex is surrounded by various stables and barns and by the Settler's House. Inside the palace you can also consult the historical notarial archive of the Comelli family, and in addition to the vast archive, another peculiarity of the palace is the complete presence of all the noble furnishings that were in the possession of the Comelli family. On the road to the palace there is also the oratory of Santa Maria in Porcole, an ancient oratory which for a long time was a stop for pilgrims on their way to Florence and Rome.\n\n\n== References ==",

Although being mostly unpopular and during the 2010s, the post COVID-19 period and subsequent socio-political crises paved the way for a larger, week-long celebration in 2022, with a three-day queer film festival, a music and dance festival, competitions and related events.\nIt was recorded that in the first event held in 2005, 350 people had attended, and participation has increased ever since, with the movement gaining much recognition, praise, support and headlines in both local and international media assets. The newspaper Ceylon Today describes the event as a \"week-long joyous celebration with a variety of events full of color, music and diversity.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nEqual Ground\nLGBT rights in Sri Lanka\nSexual minorities in Sri Lanka\n\n\n== References ==",

The sequel to Kingdom Come: Deliverance (2018), the game is scheduled to release for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S by the end of 2024.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nLike its predecessor, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is an open-world action role-playing game in which the protagonist is controlled from a first-person perspective. Once again, tasks and missions can be handled in different ways. Depending on this, the reaction of the NPCs and the world to the type of playing is different.\nIn contrast to the first part, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II features crossbows and early forms of firearms. The former can also be fired while riding.\n\n\n== Synopsis and setting ==\nAs in the predecessor, the protagonist is the blacksmith Henry, who lives in Central Bohemia during the Middle Ages, in the early 15th century.\nThe game world of Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is twice as large as that of the first part. However, it is not one large, connected world, but rather two larger, freely exploreable areas. One area is the Bohemian Paradise, which mainly consists of untouched nature, while the other is the city of Kuttenberg and its surroundings. In the late Middle Ages, Kuttenberg was the second largest city in Bohemia after Prague and one of the richest economic centers in the country due to silver mining and coinage. \nAccording to Warhorse Studios, the game will be interspersed with a total of five hours of cutscenes and will also be accessible to those who have not played the first part.\n\n\n== Development and release ==\nDevelopment on Kingdom Come: Deliverance II began in 2018, following the release of its predecessor. While Warhouse Studios had 131 employees in 2019, it had grown to around 250 people by spring 2024 at the latest. The game uses the CryEngine, with music composed by Czech composers Jan Valta and Adam Sporka. The protagonist, Henry, is again portrayed by the British actor Tom McKay. In addition, the expertise of various historians, universities and museums was once again drawn on to represent, according to Warhorse Studios, a “realistic, immersive and believable medieval world”. \nKingdom Come: Deliverance II was announced and revealed in April 2024. The game is scheduled to release for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S by the end of 2024.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Horse reform is the definitive retirement of a horse from an activity that no longer suits him properly. In the past, the term \" reform \" was used to refer to the retirement of aged, vicious or defective horses. The term is now generally used in the field of equestrian sport, where it is referred to as a \"reformed racing horse\". But it can also be used for many other activities, such as equestrian sports or teaching in riding schools. Reformed horses have a variety of fates: although some are redirected towards activities in which they are less in demand, most are taken to the slaughterhouse.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe notion of reforming horses has evolved over time. The changing status of the animal, now close to that of a pet in Western countries, has led to a search for reform options other than slaughter.\n\n\n== Reform of racehorses ==\n\nThe main cause of reformed racehorses is tendinous lesions that have induced locomotor asymmetry due to primary osteoarticular affections or those resulting from training and racing on the track. Horses reformed from racing form an important part of the equestrian centers' cavalry. In the past, they were almost systematically resold for butchery, but this practice is tending to decline, particularly in France where horse butchers are increasingly rare. However, the very high number of births means that reform is obviously high.\nMost reformed racehorses are sold as leisure horses, but remain difficult\nto re-dress, especially for amateurs. It is often necessary to call on the services of professional riders familiar with the difficulty.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was written by Enrico Riccardi with lyrics by Luigi Albertelli.\nThe song was released as a single in November 1971, rising to number three on the chart. The B-side was the song \"La mente torna\", written by Mogol and Lucio Battisti. However, the songs were not included in any studio album, but were featured on the compilation Del mio meglio n. 2 in 1973.\nThere are also Spanish-translated and sung versions of both songs by Mina, originally included in the album intended only for the Latin market Amor mio (Mina canta en Español): \"Yo qué puedo hacer\" (\"Uomo\", adapted lyrics by Julio Cesar) and \"La mente cambia\" (\"La mente torna\", lyrics by A. Belgrano).\nBoth songs were performed by Mina during the spring season of the 1972 TV program Teatro 10.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n7\" single\nA. \"Uomo\" – 3:55\nB. \"La mente torna\" (Mogol; Lucio Battisti) – 4:26\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nMina – vocals\nNatale Massara – arrangement (A1)\nGian Piero Reverberi – arrangement (B1)\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Uomo\" at Discogs (list of releases)",

        "content": "From This Day Forward is an outdoor historical drama during summers in the Fred B. Cranford Amphitheatre on Church Street in Valdese, North Carolina. The play was written by Cranford and is performed annually as the flagship show of Old Colony Players.\nThe play recounts the story of a group of French-Italian Protestants called Waldenses who came to America in 1893 and founded the community of Valdese after suffering religious persecution in Europe. Waldenses were persecuted by both the Catholic Church and reigning monarchs like Louis XIV who labeled them as heretics and sought to destroy them. The play starts in 1686 and covers 200 years of history.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe show premiered in 1968 in a custom-built amphitheater as part of the town's 75th anniversary celebration. The show runs from mid-July through mid-August.\nThe stage revolves to reveal interior scenes. The amphitheater grounds have become a preservation site for the Waldensian culture. In 1972, Tron House, the first house built when the Waldenses came to Valdese, was moved to the theatre grounds and restored for visitors. A saw mill engine Waldenses used to build their homes is also on display at the theatre. The amphitheater was renamed from the \"Old Colony Amphitheatre\" in honor of the playwright. A Bocce court was also added to the grounds.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Pulpit Bridge or Armchair Bridge (officially Bridge No. 69) carries the Northampton Loop railway line over a former entrance drive to the Watford Park estate near Watford in Northamptonshire. Built in 1877, it is now a Grade II listed building for its unusual design.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe bridge is in metal with stone abutments and brick wing walls. Its parapet has a shape which has been variously described as resembling an armchair or a pulpit. It is a single span and sits on a stone plinth. It has a pair of four-centred arches which face north and south have foliate designs. The spandrels contain the coat of arms of the Henley barons, the owners of Watford Park. The parapets take the form of balustrades with interleaving arches. They end with projections which cap the abutments and which resemble a church pulpit or the arms of a chair. The projections have decorative banding, finials and openwork in the shape of gothic arches.\nThe abutments are in moulded ashlar with stone copings. They have carved recessed panels in a similar shape to the openwork on the metal projections which are directly above. Underneath the bridge is a metal gate which rests on decorative posts and is flanked by railings on either side. The gate marks the entry point to the point.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe bridge was built in 1877 by the London and North Western Railway for its Northampton loop line which was built to provide a second pair of tracks between Roade and Rugby and to serve Northampton, which the original line bypassed in the 1830s. Watford Park belonged to Anthony Henley, 3rd Baron Henley, who apparently contributed the design for the bridge. The bridge was used as a halt from which Henley—the MP for Northampton—could travel to parliament in London. Henley was a lay vicar and is believed to have used the bridge to preach to the estate's workers, hence its nickname \"Pulpit Bridge\". The nickname \"Armchair Bridge\" was apparently coined by railway staff for its resemblance to a piece of furniture.\nThe bridge originally had other decorative cast-iron elements but these were removed in the 1930s, having deteriorated beyond repair. The bridge is otherwise little altered and is regularly maintained as an active railway bridge. It was designated a Grade II listed building in 2011 in recognition of its unusual design. Listed building status provides legal protection from unauthorised demolition or unsympathetic modification.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Harir Mountain is located in Yemen, and is one of the largest mountains in Dhale Governorate. The name of Harir Mountain is mentioned in Al-Hamdani's \"Description of the Arabian Peninsula\" book. Also in \"The History of Yemeni Tribes\" by Hamza Ali Luqman. Also mentioned by many Yemeni and Arab historians and writers, as well as in history and geography school textbooks. Harir Mountain is located in the east of Dhale governorate and within the administrative division of Al Hussein District. It's 20 kilometers from Dhale, and it is a mountain range that extends from Naqil (Al-Maadi) to the south, until Zahert Al-Atry to the n\north. Small mountains, rocky outcrops, valleys, and reefs branch off from it, as well as deep abysses to the west and east. The mountain range ends at Al-Hamayer and Al-Hasswa and Seelat Ghafinah in Shaka Valley near Aqram Mountain and at Lakmat El-Nub, Seelat Hamam, and EL-Haza to the west. And the village of Adina Wahid Ali which overlooks Murat Valley and Adina to the east. Harir Mountain is bordered from the south and east by Halimayn District. And from the north is the Shuaib district, and to the west is Shaka, Khella, Al-Hussein, and Al-Sha'ari land. Its altitude is 7800 feet above sea level. At the top of the mountain, there is a flat area on which villages have been built and residences have been constructed, interspersed with valleys and green agricultural terraces.\n\n\n== Al-Fuqaha Village ==\nAt the highest peak of Harir Mountain is the Al-Fuqaha, considered one of the largest and oldest villages on the mountain, as well as the main center of the mountain. Its buildings were constructed from hard stones. It was named after Fiqh because there were judges and legal document writers who graduated at the hands of scholars from Jableh who wrote and notarized between people. Al-Hota is an extension of the Al-Fuqaha Village, where there are some shops, where agricultural products are traded, a health center, and a high school built in 2000. At the southern end of Harir Mountain are the villages of Al-Marafda, Al-Hardud, Hegla, Al-Jous, Al-Mihra, and Al-Masnaa. Not far from these villages, in a central location to the villages of Mountain Harir, there is a unified school for boys and girls built in 1950, it is the first school built in Harir by the British known as \"School\".\n\n\n== Northern end ==\nThe northern end of Harir Mountain includes the village of Adina, which is known for its cultivation of coffee and grains and its abundance of water. Arashi Village is an agricultural village with an abundance of water as well. Zahera Village which is known for its coffee cultivation. Marrat Village is known for its wide range of land and surface wells. These villages are located on the top of Harir Mountain from south to north, while the villages related to the mountain from east to west include the villages of Ghasha, Husn al-Badawi, Asiqa, Mashirah, and Mthaad. The villages from the west include Al-Maariyad, Al-Qabal, Azan, Laklamt al-Nowab, Al-Qarmah, and Ataba. The Aden port, airport, and free zone can be seen from the south side. Also from the east side, the Yafe Mountains and the Halimayn Mountains. Also, Al-Awabel Mountain and Meris Mountain, which is adjacent to Harir Mountain from the north and Jahaf Mountain from the west can be seen. The mountain is believed to be the original home of the Hariri family. As Muhammad Abdul Qadir Bamatraf points out in his book “Al-Jami’: Notable Emigrants Affiliated to Yemen and Their Tribes”: The Hariri is a tribe of the Azdi tribe, one of the largest Hauran clans, one of the governorates of the Syrian Republic, owns 18 villages, and had moved from Basra except for a group that remained there.\n\n\n== Origin of the name ==\nHarir Mountain is the original home of the Hariris which their historical origin goes back to Harir ibn al-Harith ibn Zayd ibn Yarim ibn Dhu-Ra'een, with their descendants, including Shams al-Din and the Fakhreddin families. Some of them lived in this mountain, some of them migrated to other places, and some of them settled in Aden and are called \"Al-Hariri\". Harir Mountain has many historical landmarks and monuments, which can indicate that ancient man inhabited the peaks of the mountain. There are some ancient inscriptions and writings on Rumah and Attaba. In boulders, and some old rocks, dams carved into the mountain, as well as cemeteries, and some old fortresses, which believed that it is related to the ruins of Aqram Mountain in Shekaa.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nJabal An-Nabi Shu'ayb\n\n\n== References ==",

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe store was built in 1884 by A.M.E. Zion minister Frank W. Ward.  It served as a general store and community gathering place in its predominantly Black neighborhood in the south part of Greenville.  Ward operated the store until his death in 1925, when his wife Sallie took over the business until her death in the 1930s.  The store continued under the ownership of Nobie Price until the 1960s, when the building was rented out and used as a social center.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe store is a folk variant of Greek Revival corner stores that were abundant in the Southern United States in the 19th century.  It sits on the corner of its lot, facing the busier east–west street through the neighborhood.  The building is a narrow, one-story frame structure with a front-facing gable roof.  It sits on brick piers, with the front of the foundation completely faced with brick and incorporating stairs.  The entrance is on a recessed porch supported by four square columns, with the door flanked by projecting display windows.  Behind the store is a late 19th century house, originally brick but now covered with siding.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The Jeff Younger custody battle was a highly publicized custody dispute between Texas parents Jeff Younger and Anne Georgulas over their twin children. Litigated between 2018 and 2022, the case attracted national attention as Georgulas claimed one of the children, born as a boy, was a transgender girl, which Younger denied. Custody was ultimately granted to Georgulas, with the dispute reaching the Texas Supreme Court.\n\n\n== Background ==\nYounger, a resident of Flower Mound, Texas, and Georgulas, a pediatrician from Coppell, Texas, had their marriage annulled in 2016. The parents had twins, both born in 2012 as boys, and disagreed about one of their twins' gender identity. According to Younger, their child named Luna (born James), first expressed a desire to be a girl at three years old. While the parents had joint custody, Luna was diagnosed with gender dysphoria at the age of five, upon which Georgulas allowed the child to paint their nails and wear dresses. Younger claimed that Luna presented as a boy when they spent time with him, and that Georgulas was pressuring the child to identify as a girl and use female gender pronouns.\nIn August 2018, Georgulas filed a restraining order against Younger that would prevent him from entering the twins' school or telling other parents that the gender of Luna was not female. She also sought to alter the terms of their joint custody agreement to require Younger to call the child \"Luna\", use female pronouns, and prevent Luna from spending time with those who did otherwise. Georgulas attempted to enrol Luna in gender transition therapy, though the clinic did not accept Luna as a client following Younger's objections. In her lawsuit, Georgulas alleged that Younger had engaged in \"emotionally abusive\" behavior in response to Luna's gender identity.\nIn response, Younger petitioned for full custody of the twins, calling Georgulas' actions \"tampering with the sexual identity of a vulnerable boy\", and stating that Georgulas would \"chemically castrate\" Luna when they were old enough to transition. Court transcripts did not show that Georgulas was immediately planning such a procedure. In support of his case, Younger launched a #ProtectJamesYounger internet campaign that gained the support of state Republican politicians such as U.S. Senator Ted Cruz and U.S. Representative Dan Crenshaw. Per Georgulas' attorneys, the publicity led to threats, harassment and vandalism against her by strangers.\n\n\n== Initial rulings ==\nOn October 22, 2019, a jury ruled 11–1 giving Georgulas custody and full authority over Luna's medical care. On October 24, Dallas County District Judge Kim Cooks vacated the jury's decision and granted Younger and Georgulas joint custody over the twins, then seven years old. Cooks ordered that any medical decisions for the twins be made by both parents in agreement. She criticized both parents in her ruling; Georgulas for admitting that she may have \"over-affirmed\" Luna's female identity, and Younger for his efforts to raise donations and publicity from the case.\nFollowing the initial jury ruling, Texas Governor Greg Abbott declared that the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services and the Texas Attorney General’s Office were \"looking into\" the dispute. In a letter to the state's child welfare agency, Texas First Assistant Attorney General Jeff Mateer asserted Luna was \"in immediate and irrevocable danger\" from the prospect of transitioning at such a young age. Cooks' decision was criticized by LGBT advocates, with Gillian Branstetter of the National Center for Transgender Equality stating it was a \"serious disservice\" to \"give any incentive for a parent to reject their child for who they are\".\n\n\n== Further developments ==\nAfter Cooks' ruling, Georgulas filed a motion asking the court to conform to the jury's original ruling. On January 29, 2020, Dallas District Court Judge Mary Brown ruled that joint custody would remain in place. However, on August 3, 2021, Brown awarded full custody of the twins to Georgulas, ruling that Younger \"failed to timely make the payments of child support, medical support and interest as ordered\". Georgulas' legal team claimed that Younger, in addition to paying child support late, had refused to carry out court orders including required counseling and educational decisions, while Younger argued he had made payments on time and they had just been disbursed late. According to the ruling, both parents still had to consent to any hormone therapy, puberty blockers or gender-affirming surgery for Luna.\nOn November 23, 2021, Younger filed to run for the Texas House of Representatives in District 63 as a Republican. He sought to criminalize gender reassignment for children as part of his campaign. Younger advanced to the primary runoff, but lost to Ben Bumgarner.\nIn February 2022, Governor Greg Abbott issued an order to investigate parents in Texas for child abuse if they provided certain medical treatments to their transgender children, which The New York Times noted Younger's case had \"paved the way for\".\nOn December 16, 2022, after Georgulas had moved with the twins to California, Younger filed a petition with the Texas Supreme Court seeking to return the children to Texas. California had recently passed a law preventing the enforcement of orders from other states that would remove a child from their parent based on that parent providing gender-affirming care. The Supreme Court dismissed Younger's petition on December 30, with Justices Jimmy Blacklock and Evan Young writing that the court \"cannot intervene based on tenuous speculation about what other courts might do in the future\". The justices noted that Georgulas still required Younger's permission to approve medical transition therapy for Luna, and that Younger would be entitled to an immediate appeal if Georgulas initiated such procedures. Georgulas had indicated to the court that she did not intend to medically transition Luna. In response to the ruling, Younger proclaimed Texas to be \"an empire of child abuse, led by Texas judges\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Guy Cudell (12 February 1917 – 16 May 1999) was a Belgian politician of the Belgian Socialist Party and the French-speaking Socialist Party (PS). He was first voted onto the council in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode in the Brussels Capital Region in 1946 and was mayor from 1953 until his death.\nCudell was born in Woluwe-Saint-Pierre. Following his election to the council, he was put in charge of education, and was an early adopter of mixed-sex education in 1947, and family planning in 1962. He was also a member of the Chamber of Representatives (1954–1977), the Senate of Belgium and was minister for development in the cabinet of prime minister Edmond Leburton from 1973 to 1974.\nOn 24 June 1984, Cudell was kidnapped in nearby Ixelles by René Busschot. Busschot kept him captive in Tellin, Luxembourg Province. Cudell was able to break out of his handcuffs and escape the empty house through an open door. An envelope left at the house identified Busschot, who handed himself in on 26 June and was sentenced in 1988 to a suspended sentence of three years. Cudell's account of the events has been doubted by some in Belgium, who allege that he had orchestrated the event.\nCudell was the subject of the fly on the wall documentary Le bourgmestre a dit (\"The Mayor Said\"), filmed in 1996 by Marie-Hélène Massin.\nCudell died of cancer, aged 82.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "David Joravsky (September 9, 1925 – October 4, 2020) was an American professor of history, specializing in the Soviet Union's academics in the biological sciences and related politics.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nBorn in 1925 in Evanston, Illinois, to Joseph and Bertha (Segal) Joravsky. David Joravsky served in the United States Army from 1944 to 1946. He graduated in 1947 with a bachelor's degree from the University of Pennsylvania. He became a graduate student at Columbia University, where he graduated in 1949 with a master's degree. He married his wife Doris in 1949. He received his Ph.D. in 1958 from Columbia University's Russian Institute (renamed in 1982 the Harriman Institute). In 1953 he was an instructor at Cornell University. Joravsky was an instructor in history from 1953 to 1954 at Marietta College in Ohio and from 1954 to 1958 at the University of Connecticut in Storrs. In 1958 he was appointed an assistant professor at Brown University, where he was promoted to associate professor in 1961. In 1965 he resigned from Brown University and became a full professor at Northwestern University and retained his professorship until he retired as professor emeritus. He chaired Northwestern University's history department in 1966 and again from 1980 to 1983.\nFrom 1966 to 1969, Joravsky was a director of the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies (renamed in 2010 the Association for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies). He was in 1977–1978 a Woodrow Wilson Center Fellow and from 1982 to 1988 a trustee of the National Council for Soviet and East European Research (NCSEER), founded in 1978 and currently named the National Council for Eurasian and Eastern European Research (NCEEER).\n\n\n== Works ==\nJoravsky promoted the 1971 publication by Alfred A. Knopf of the book Let history judge: the origins and consequences of Stalinism translated from Roy A. Medvedev's original Russian by Colleen Taylor and edited by Joravsky and Georges Haupt with an introduction by Joravsky.\n\nJoravsky's main work is The Lysenko Affair, devoted to the intellectual dictatorship established by Trofim Lysenko (1898–1976), a Soviet agriculturist, who became in 1940 the director of the Institute of Genetics within the USSR's Academy of Sciences. Lysenko is notorious for a genetic pseudo-scientific theory, “Michurinian genetics”, which he promoted during the Stalinist period in the Soviet Union. In 1948 Michurian genetics reached the rank of exclusive official theory opposed to \"bourgeois science\". By conducting an investigation based upon the testimonies of people, such as Zhores Medvedev, directly involved in the Lysenko Affair, Joravsky established that Lysenko stubbornly rejected statistically based science, in general, and Mendelian genetics, in particular, and flourished in a system that enforced the view that those with the most political power were always correct. Joravsky elucidated the elements, both political and cultural, which led to many years of political misfortune for scientists accused of \"bourgeois science\". In a 1989 paper, Nils Roll-Hansen called Joravsky's book \"the best documented and most penetrating study\" of Lysenkoism. The BBC used Joravsky's book extensively for a dramatized documentary about Soviet science in the 1930s.\nJoravsky published many articles in a wide variety of periodicals, including The Nation, The New York Review of Books, the Political Science Quarterly, the journal Science, and Soviet Studies (renamed in 1993 Europe-Asia Studies). His book Soviet Marxism and Natural Science: 1917-1932 was published by Columbia University Press in 1961, and his book Russian Psychology: A Critical History was published by Blackwell in 1989. At the time of his death in 2020, he had completed an unpublished book entitled Great Nations of the West.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nJoravsky was a Guggenheim Fellow for the academic year 1964–1965. In 1971 he received the History of Science Society's Pfizer Award for his book The Lysenko Affair.\n\n\n== Family ==\nDavid Joravsky had three sisters. He dedicated his book The Lysenko Affair to his sister Esther, who died in 1962 at the age of 38 and was the mother of three sons. David and Doris Joravsky had a son and a daughter. Doris Joravsky (1927–2018) was for thirty years a public school teacher in Chicago.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\n\n\n=== Articles ===\nJoravsky, David (1955). \"Soviet Views on the History of Science\".

        "content": "Ian Shane is an American ice hockey goaltender currently playing for Cornell. He was named a Second Team All-American in 2023–24.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\n\n\n=== College ===\nShane began attending Cornell University in the fall of 2021 after the Big Red had cancelled its entire season the year before due to COVID-19. Shane began his freshman season as the team's third goaltender, however, by the middle of the season he got his first turn as the starter in goal. He swiftly established himself as the best option, backstopping a road sweep of #5 North Dakota and then downing top-ranked Quinnipiac a few weeks later. Unfortunately, just as he was getting used to the college game, head coach Mike Schafer suffered a medical emergency and had to sit out the remainder of the season while being implanted with a coronary stent. Without their bench boss, the team struggled down the backstretch and they dropped 10 spots in the national rankings. Cornell ended up just missing out on a tournament appearance but Shane had still performed well through the rough patch. He ended the year with a save percentage of .933 and was fourth nationally with a 1.72 goals against average.\nFor his sophomore season, Shane entered as the established starter and held the job for the entire season. While his save percentage dropped, Cornell's strong defense helped him to keep his sub-2.00 g.a.a. Despite a rocky start to the season, Cornell was able to build momentum as the year went along and by the time the playoffs rolled around, the Big Red were guaranteed a spot in the national tournament. In his first tournament appearance, Shane shoutout  Denver, the first blanking by Cornell since Ken Dryden in 1967. Though Shane continued his strong play in the regional final, a lack of scoring by Cornell cost the team and they were knocked out with a 1–2 loss.\nYear three for Shane looked to be even better, with statistical improvements across the board. Unfortunately, because ECAC Hockey was ranked lower than they had been the year before, Cornell would have to win their conference championship to make the national tournament once more. Shane had a few shaky performances but he turned in a tremendous performance in the title game to win Cornell the Whitelaw Cup for the first time in 14 years and guarantee the program an NCAA appearance. In their opening game, Maine opened the scoring but Shane refused to allow a second goal. The junior netminder turned aside 31 of 32 shots to lead the Big Red to victory and set up a rematch with Denver in the regional final. The roles reversed for the Big Red and, after taking an early lead, Cornell's offense failed to build upon the advantage and the team ended up losing 1–2.\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Shane had the lowest goals against average in the nation by a considerable margin. He was named as both the Ken Dryden Award winner and a Second Team All-American.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiographical information and career statistics from Eliteprospects.com, or The Internet Hockey Database",

        "content": "Georgios Flessas (1716 – 16 July 1770) was the son of Dimitris Flessas and grandfather of the fighter Papaflessas.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nHe was born in Poliani of Messenia in 1716. With his two brothers Nikolaos and Konstantinos they had the goats and sheep of the Flessians in Poliani and in the winter they went down to Gardiki to spend the winter. From a very young age he was trained in the rifle and the yatagan by his father and when he came of age he formed his own Klepht group with his brothers, other Flessians and Polianites, to protect their families from the Turks and bandits.\n\n\n== Historical frame ==\nIn 1770 the Greek rebellion broke out at the instigation of Russia, which sent the Orlov brothers to Greece to take over the leadership. The Russians and the Greeks had friendly relations because of their common Orthodox faith. At the same time, the Russians believed that the Greeks could weaken the Ottoman empire for their own benefit, while the Greeks, since they began to gain national consciousness, hoped that Russia would grant them their liberation.\nPeter the Great was the first Russian who had conceived the dream of reconstituting the Byzantine empire under his orders and for this reason he did his best to maintain friendly relations with the Greeks, whom he intended to use against the sultan in the future. The Greeks recognized in the person of Peter their patron. Russian aspirations were inherited as a natural continuation to Peter's successors. Thus Catherine II of Russia, who had been at war with the High Gate since January 1769, immediately thought of the Greeks when she needed a distraction to save her army which was threatened by the Tatars on the banks of the Dnieper river.\nWith the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca the Russian forces withdrew leaving the Greeks.\n\n\n== Participation in Orlov revolt ==\nOn 5 July 1770, the last act of the revolution took place in Messini by Orlov. There, in the ruins of the old tower of Izambos, in the present site of Panigyristria, Flessas fortified himself with 150 Messenians. He had arrived there earlier with 150 Messinians to support Ioannis Skylogiannis, a relative of P. Gerakaris, who distinguished himself under Morosini. They encamped in the tower of Georgios Hatzis or Pligouris outside the Fortress of Pylos, but were besieged by the Turks who had hurriedly arrived from Tripoli and a massacre ensued.\nOne remained from this clash:\n\n\n== See also ==\nOrlov revolt\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Parochial patronage refers to several Catholic and Protestant organizations initially dedicated to the popular education of underprivileged young people. Such institutions appeared in various European countries at the end of the 19th and 20th centuries - in particular, under the name of Orel in the provinces of the Austro-Hungarian Empire – but the term \"patronage\" remained closely associated with Belgium, and even more so with France, where Catholic patronages were founded in Marseille at the end of the Consulate by Abbé Jean-Joseph Allemand. Abbé Timon-David later took up the idea, and then widely developed within congregations such as the Brothers of the Christian Schools, Jean Bosco's Salesians, Frédéric Ozanam's Brothers of Saint Vincent de Paul, the Dominican Third Order and, later, the Sons of Charity in the early 20th century.\nIn parallel with social Catholicism, these institutions developed in parishes in France at the end of the 19th century. They led to the creation of a sports federation in 1898, a few years after Belgium. In 1903, this federation became the French Federation of Gymnastics and Sports Patronages and, in 1968, the French Federation of Sport and Culture. In 1905, with the law on the separation between Church and State, the patronages adopted the status of associations under the law of 1901. Between the two world wars and after 1945, the number of patronages grew rapidly. Since 1965, however, the pastoral decisions of the Church of France have forced them to secularize, and today's patronages are more often than not simply secular sports and cultural associations, most of which remain attached to their original references.\n\n\n== From precursors to a federation ==\n\n\n=== Patronage of religious orders (1800-1870) ===\n\nIn France, patronages were founded at the beginning of the 19th century in Marseille by Father Jean-Joseph Allemand, who defined them as \"places where people play and pray\". By creating a space for physical activities as a complement to study circles, they appeared both within the charitable institutions with a social vocation of the Brothers of Saint Vincent de Paul - in Paris in 1835, Rennes in 1840 with the Cadets of Brittany - and within those of teaching orders aimed at the elite, such as the Institute of Sorèze with Father Henri Lacordaire. Traditional running, stilt-walking, and ball games made up the bulk of these activities at first, but with Timon David, gymnastics, developed under the Restoration by Colonel Don Francisco Amoros, took pride of place. This trend was reinforced by the Brothers of the Christian Schools, who included it in their school activities.\nThis practice remained mainly intramural, and the local patronages of the various religious orders generally avoided meeting and clashing. It wasn't until 1855 that a joint magazine was published, while in Paris an association of young workers was founded by Maurice Maignen. In August 1858, some of the directors of these organizations met at a congress in Angers, where they founded the Union of Catholic Workers of France. In 1865, Maignen's association became the Cercle of the Young Workers, and on the eve of the 1870 war, the Society of Catholic Worker Circles was created. The motto of the International Olympic Committee (IOC): Citius, Altius, Fortius, first uttered on March 7, 1891, was borrowed from one of these institutions, the Albert-le-Grand school in Arcueil, run by Father Henri Didon, a member of the first board of directors of the Union of French athletic sports societies(USFSA).\n\n\n== Parochial patronage (1870-1898) ==\n\nIn 1871, after the defeat of 1870, Count Albert de Mun created the Circles of Catholic Workers. Dr. Paul Michaux, founder of Gymnastics and Sports Federation of French patronages FGSPF, admitted to having participated or collaborated in twenty-five gymnastic, sporting, and military festivals between 1872 and 1897, long before the creation of his federation. It was only after the elections of 1877 and 1879 and the arrival of the Republicans in power that the parish patronages took off, supported by the high clergy and placed under the authority of a vicar-director. Between 1900 and 1960, practically all parishes (except small rural ones) had a \"patros\" with a sports section, an essential complement to catechism classes. The patronships of the nineteenth century, mainly for apprentices and young workers, then opened up to children of all ages.\nIn 1888, a commission for patronages and youth works in France was created at the headquarters of the Catholic Institute of Paris (ICP). Three years later, on January 1, 1891, this commission published its bulletin Le Patronage  In addition to the charity conferences and study circles that promoted social Catholicism, physical activities took on such importance that they became a major driving force, both through their civic and school organizations, in the growth of gymnastics and the birth of sport in France.\nBefore 1914, the three main French federations were the FGSPF, the Union of Gymnastics Societies of France (USGF), and the Union of French Athletic Sports Societies (USFSA). After 1918, the latter disappeared in favor of specialized federations - French Soccer Federation (FFF), French Athletics Federation (FFA), French Rugby Federation(FFR), then French Basketball Federation(FFBB), French Volleyball Federation (FFVB) - but the other two remained. The anti-clericalism of the Third Republic, especially that of the USGF, led the Episcopate in 1898 to encourage the reunification of its gymnastic sections within a specific organization. These patronages were not limited to metropolitan France; they also developed in the French colonial empire and particularly in Algeria, on the initiative of Mgr Lavigerie.\n\n\n== Constitution of a federation (1898-1906) ==\nTwo years after the renewal of the Olympic Games, which emphasized the importance of sport, the Union of Gymnastics and Military Instruction Societies of Patronages and Youth Works of France (USGIMPOJF) was created in 1898, in a generally tense context between lay people and Catholics, the same year as the revision of the Dreyfus trial. In 1901, the organization became the Catholic Gymnastics Societies Federation(FSCG) before becoming the FGSPF in 1903. Paul Michaux, born in Lorraine but adopted in Paris, was not the only one to take up the cause: At the end of 1902, the organization named the Elsaessicher Turnerbund (ETB) which then took the name -  Avant-garde du Rhin (AGR) -  finally received the recognition from the German authorities that it had been seeking for several years, and the Lyon region, with some thirty patronages at the turn of the century, declared its own Federation of Catholic Gymnastics Societies of the Rhône and South-East  at the beginning of 1903, which joined the FGSPF in 1908.\nDespite these new federating structures, many patronages continued to join both the USGF and the USFSA, which had previously welcomed them. The hostility of the public authorities and these federations towards those who responded to the Pope's invitation and took part in the gymnastics competition, in 1906, in Rome, brought them under the Catholic umbrella of the FGSPF, which began organizing its championships. This became the French Sports Federation (FSF) in 1947, then the Sports and Cultural Federation of France (FSCF) in 1968. Long before the introduction of the license, participation in gymnastics and music competitions organized by the federation was the most tangible sign of membership.\n\n\n== From patronage to association ==\n\n\n=== The time of the battles (1906 - 1919) ===\n\nTo protect themselves from anticlerical measures, some patronages had already opted for the associative status opened up by the recent law of 1901. In Auxerre, for example, Father Deschamps anticipated the separation of Church and State by declaring his patronage to the prefecture. The movement gained momentum in the fall of 1906. To comply with the law and on the advice of Charles Simon, secretary-general of the FGSPF, many patronages changed their names: Saint-Joseph of Auxerre became the Auxerre Youth Association, Saint-Léon of Bagnolet became Alsace of Bagnolet, the patronage Saint-Honoré of Eylau became Star of Two Lakes, Sister Genevieve's works for great careers became Championnet Sports, soon joined by the Association Championnet, and the patronage Saint-Denys of Argenteuil became Saint-Georges of Argenteuil. Often, as in Cholet with the parallel histories of the Notre-Dame-de-la-Garde and Jeune-France patronages, the former patronage remained to manage non-sporting activities, and the board members of the two associations were almost always the same.\nThe vicar-director had to live with a president whose candidacy was usually encouraged by his parish priest. The \"patronages\" were replaced by the \"Patrons\", an essential part of the origins of French sport. But their role did not stop there, they also made a major contribution to the development of music through their cliques and brass bands, theater, popular cinema, and summer camps. For a long time, these activities were managed by specific organizations, such as the Theatrical Association of catholic works for popular education (ATOCEP) and the Federation of Cinematographic Leisure and Culture (FLECC), and it was not until the 1960s that the FSCF took them over.\nFrom 1900 to 1914, the patronages joined in the hope of regaining Alsace and Lorraine and made military training and marksmanship a priority: in 1914, when almost all of them had already adopted the status of the law of 1901, one in three holders of military aptitude certificate had prepared for it within the FGSPF. The FGSPF lost more than 24,000 members during the First World War, but its activities continued unabated. In Paris, they offered their services and unmobilized personnel to the Ministry of War, helped care for the wounded at the Gare de l'Est  \"East station\", and assisted in agricultural work. On August 4, 1919, they brought 7,000 gymnasts from all over France to Metz to welcome the AGR, the Catholic patronage association of Alsace.\n\n\n== The Golden Age (1919-1965) ==\n\nDespite the criticism voiced in certain progressive circles of the clergy against \"sports with a taste of war\", the end of the First World War marked the beginning of a particularly prosperous era. Between the recent demise of the USFSA and the still nascent development of single-sport federations, their fledgling federation became the largest in France, with 1,500 of its 2,500 patronages officially recognized in 1928. Although gymnastics remained the main activity, other sports also developed, particularly basketball, which was structured in 1920 within the FFA, born from the dissolution of the USFSA at the end of the war. In 1925, in the Paris region alone, the Federation of Patronages had 110 teams, while the FFA had only 57. A patronage from Le Havre founded in 1874, Union Saint-Thomas-d'Aquin, was the first club to be registered by the new FFBB when it became autonomous in 1932.\nDuring the Occupation, the activity of patronages slowed considerably, with many preferring to remain dormant rather than risk the merger with foreign, or even hostile associations imposed by the Sports Charter. A few, such as the Championnet Association in Paris, deliberately joined the Resistance, where their services are recognized today. Leaders and vicars-directors sometimes went underground without putting other members at risk, as in Argenteuil, where a local study shows the strong commitment of directors (Fathers Paul Louis and François Spahnagel) and lay leaders (Lieutenant-Colonel Clément Prudhon and Captain Maurice Weber). The merger of the men's and women's patronages, imposed by the Vichy regime, was not called into question after the Liberation; their revival contributed locally to the national recovery, and they soon returned to their pre-war level of development.\nIts members shone at the 1948 London Olympics, where Adrien Rommel won gold for the fencing team and the basketball team, five of whose members came from the patronages, took second place. That same year, the FSF demonstrated the health of its federations by bringing together 12,000 gymnasts and musicians in Paris for its fiftieth anniversary. Basketball experienced exceptional growth within the FSF: each patronage had its team, and the FSF was at the top of the French game. In 1949, the Spartiates d'Oran, the best club in Algeria, were crowned champions of the French Union after defeating the French military team and the Villeurbanne Éveil Lyonnais Sports Association (ASVEL), then champions of Metropolitan France. The FSF (now FSCF), which grouped them together, reached its peak in the 1950s with some 4,200 clubs and 800,000 members.\n\n\n== Post-Vatican II ==\n\nThe change in the French Church's attitude towards charities following the Second Vatican Council profoundly altered the nature of patronage. Some of the clergy had always expressed reservations about their pastoral value, and even at times strongly criticized the use of this \"sport with a taste for war\"; in 1988, the title of Professor Gérard Cholvy's book, Le Patronage, ghetto ou Vivier, clearly set out the terms of this debate. The implementation of the council was an opportunity for these detractors to obtain their total outsourcing from parishes and to abolish their directors. For the parish patronages, this meant both denial of the validity of an almost century-old experience and a series of related material losses: the loss of a source of funding, the loss of a free \"social worker\" coupled with an administrator (the priest-director), and often also the loss of historic premises.\nThe need to use municipal facilities in order to survive forced many of them to accept, in return, the obligation of double membership in delegating associations demanded by certain municipalities. In 1968, to control their flight, the FSF decided to broaden its scope to include the historical cultural activities of the patronages and changed its acronym accordingly. Since the Second Vatican Council, the 3,600 associations affiliated to the FSCF have become Omnisports and cultural associations with an essentially secular orientation, but which explicitly refer to an ethic inherited from their past, and many of them still call themselves \"patros\".\nAs with all associations, the activities of the FSCF-affiliated patronages include sports training and cultural workshops (visual arts, theater, choir, dance, twirling) during the week and competitions or meetings on weekends. For some, maintenance and outdoor activities (hiking) play an important role, as does motor development for young children. Some former patrons, now large multisport clubs, join only for these activities. Except gymnastics, which is still very active, the sports disciplines of the FSCF suffer greatly from their dual affiliation, and the attractiveness of the competitions often suffers as a result. What's more, the brass bands, once the pride of the patronages, are becoming increasingly rare.\n\n\n== A Revival of Patronage ==\nIn 1994, Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger, Archbishop of Paris, approved the creation of a federation of cultural, educational, and leisure associations (FACEL) for the Paris diocese, with the aim of \"promoting Christian education through cultural and leisure activities, and facilitating access to the catechism in parishes and schools\". The new organization, which takes the form of an open-air center, is reminiscent of the \"patronages\" that used to welcome children on Thursday afternoons when school was not in session. This federation of some fifty leisure associations began to expand into the suburbs and provinces.\nNew communities are also taking an interest in patronages. For example, the Community Saint-Martin and the brothers and sisters of the Community Saint-Jean have taken over or founded patronages since the early 2000s.\nThe revival of the parochial patronage continued in the 21st century with an initiative taken by the founders of the patronage. In 2020, a foundation was created under the auspices of the Raoul Follereau Foundation: the Foundation of Patronages of France, whose purpose is to support welcome centers for inspired youth by the pedagogy of patronage. This support is provided within the framework of the Union for Patronages, which brings together Christian educational organizations to support parochial initiatives. A true incubator for sponsorship, this Union was officially launched on June 28, 2021. The Association for the Training of Entertainment and Leisure Executives ( AFOCAL ) has published a guide for sponsorship organizers.\nIn 2022, under the auspices of the Common Good Fund, the Union of Patronages and the Lapparent Centre have joined forces to create a patronage incubator: Esprit de Patronage. The aim is to meet the needs of the growing number of patronage founders. We could be witnessing a real renaissance of patronage in France.\n\n\n== Some patronages ==\nThe history of French sport is marked by patronages. The first is football, with the Star of Two Lakes, where two of the founders of the FFF, Charles Simon and Henri Delaunay, cut their teeth, followed by Auxerre Youth Association of Father Deschamps and its historic coach Guy Roux.\nIt should also be remembered that up until the professionalization of the game, basketball was the exclusive domain of the patrons:\n\nSaint-Thomas-d'Aquin in Le Havre was the first club to be affiliated to the FFBB when it was founded in 1932;\nChampionnet Sports supplied three players to the runner-up team at the 1948 London Olympics;\nThe Spartans of Oran were crowned champions of the French community in 1949 after defeating the French military team and ASVEL, the metropolitan champions formed by the merger of the Éveil Sportif Sainte-Marie de la Guillotière of Lyon with a Labour club from Villeurbanne;\nl'Alsace de Bagnolet, preceded by Championnet Sports, was multiple French basketball champion in the 1960s;\nLe patronage du Bon Conseil was founded in 1894 by Father Esquerré at 6 street Albert de Lapparent, Paris 7th arrondissement.\nThe majority of patronages have since given up on the adventure of professionalism, as la Jeune-France de Cholet did in 1975, giving way to Cholet Basket. Nevertheless, some remain major regional associations, such as la Tour d'Auvergne in Rennes and its neighbor les Cadets de Bretagne, la Cambronnaise de Saint-Sébastien-sur-Loire and la Jeune Garde de Villefranche. But in keeping with the original spirit, many of them work more discreetly with the working classes, such as la Saint-Georges d’Argenteuil, le Chantier de Paris and la Semeuse de Nice.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n=== References ===",

        "content": "São Bento Street (Portuguese: Rua São Bento) is a historic road located in the Sé district, in the center of the Brazilian city of São Paulo. It starts at Largo São Francisco, next to José Bonifácio Street, and passes through Patriarca Square, Direita Street, Quitanda Street, Largo do Café, Miguel Couto Street and Antonio Prado Square. It ends at Boa Vista Street, in Largo São Bento. Currently, it is predominantly commercial. It includes the Martinelli Building, whose main entrance is accessed from São Bento Street.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nOpened in the 16th century, São Bento Street is one of the oldest thoroughfares in São Paulo. Initially, it consisted of a simple dirt track linking the old village of the cacique Tibiriçá (now Largo São Bento) to the vicinity of Direita Street. The name refers to the Monastery of Saint Benedict, located in Largo São Bento. The site was donated by the São Paulo City Council in 1600 to the monks for the construction of the church.\nIt was first called Martim Afonso Tibiriçá Street. After the construction of the Convent of Saint Francis, inaugurated on September 17, 1647, it became known as Rua que Vai para São Francisco (English: Street leading to Saint Francis). Later, it was renamed Rua de São Bento para São Francisco (Street from Saint Benedict to Saint Francis) and Rua que Vai para São Bento (Street leading to Saint Benedict).\nOn March 12, 1897, the São Paulo City Council changed the name to Coronel Moreira César Street, after the military commander who had been killed in the War of Canudos. The measure did not please the population; on August 28, 1899, Law No. 416 ordered that it be renamed São Bento Street. Historical studies suggest that the street was the site of the São Paulo City Hall in 1619.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTourism in the city of São Paulo\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Vasuki  is an extinct genus of madtsoiid snake from the Middle Eocene Naredi Formation of India. The genus contains a single species, V. indicus, known from several vertebrae. Vasuki has an estimated body length between 11–15 m (36–49 ft), making it the largest known madtsoiid.\n\n\n== Discovery and naming ==\nThe Vasuki holotype specimen, IITR/VPL/SB 3102-1-21, was discovered in sediments of the Naredi Formation in the Panandhro Lignite Mine in the Kutch district of Gujarat State, western India. The specimen consists of 27 pre-cloacal vertebrae, some of which were found in articulation. The fossil material was found some time after 2004, and preliminary analyses suggested crocodilian affinities for the fossil material without further review.\nIn 2024, Vasuki indicus was described as a new genus and species of madtsoiid snake based on these fossil remains. The generic name, Vasuki, references the divine serpent of the same name from Hindu mythology. The specific name, indicus, references India, the country from which Vasuki is known.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe body length estimations of Vasuki are derived from predictive regression equations: one based on postzygapophyseal width, and the other based on prezygapophyseal width. The former equation resulted in a body length range of 10.9–12.2 metres (36–40 ft), while the latter equation resulted in a body length range of 14.5–15.2 metres (48–50 ft). Although the vertebral dimensions of Vasuki are smaller than those of Titanoboa, the largest length estimates indicate a longer body than that taxon.\n\n\n== Classification ==\nIn a phylogenetic analyses, Vasuki is recovered as a member of the extinct snake clade Madtsoiidae as the sister taxon to the clade formed by Madtsoia pisdurensis (Late Cretaceous India) and Gigantophis garstini (Late Eocene North Africa). It is a member of a lineage of medium–large bodied madtsoiids, which is in turn sister to a clade of smaller madtsoiids. The results are displayed in the cladogram below:\n\n\n== Paleoenvironment ==\nUnlike other large-bodied snakes like Titanoboa, Vasuki was probably not an aquatic animal. Its vertebral morphology instead suggests a terrestrial (or possibly semi-aquatic) lifestyle when compared to related madtsoiids and modern pythonoids. The Vasuki fossils were deposited in a backswamp marsh. Large extant pythonids are found in similar habitats.\nVasuki is known from the Naredi Formation, which dates to the Middle Eocene. Fossils of catfish, turtles, crocodilians, and early cetaceans are also known from this formation, any of which may have been the prey of Vasuki.\n\n\n== References ==",

Little purchased the house in the late 1800s, and Vernon Stabler purchased it in 1937.  The house is a one-story Greek Revival building, with a hipped roof and wraparound recessed porch.  The bracketed eaves show Italianate influence on the design.  The original interior was a double-pile center-hall plan.  Several rooms were added to the rear of the house, as well as a porte-cochère, in a 1940s–1950s remodel.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Ambush near the Bay of Manila (Danish; Angrebet nær Manilabugten), alternatively the Death of Bernt Pessart (Danish; Bernt Pessarts død), was an ambush by the Indigenous peoples of the Philippines, against a combined Dano-Dutch espionaging expeditionary force in 1645. The ambush led to the death of former governor and president of Danish India, Bernt Pessart.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nBernt Pessart's regime led to a financial crisis for the Danish East India Company. This damaged the Danish East Indian reputation to such a point that Christian IV of Denmark ordered the arrest of Pessart and sent Willem Leyel to Dansborg to succede him.\nWhen Pessart was notified if Leyel's arrival, he hastly bought a Portuguese sloop, which he renamed Dend Gode Haab (The Good Hope), and left for Japan. Though, Dend Gode Haab was intercepted by the Dutch at Malacca and, together with Pessart, brought to Batavia. Here Pessart received 10 men and new goods by the Dutch authorities, which then ordered him to espionage on the Spanish Philippines.\nWhen they reached the Philippines Pessart's Dutch mate, had difficulties finding the Bay of Manila, and accidently entered another nearby bay. Though in the hopes to find someone to direct them, they dropped anchor. Here they would stay for the next couple of days to gather fresh water, firewood and to repait their sails.\n\n\n== Ambush ==\nThey remained for a week; but on the seventh day Pessart went fishing with a boat and some of the men and caught three large fish. While preparing the fish, some natives came out of the nearby woods and shot at Pessart and his men. Pessart, the Dutch mate and a Laplander were all shot. Pessart managed to get out to the boat, where he and the Laplander were dragged up, while Pessart gasped: Help me up, or i am a dead man! The boat only had one oar, though they still managed to get out to ship, Dend Gode Haab. When Pessart got onboard on Dend Gode Haab he was already dead, and was subsequently buried on a small island nearby.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nSince the captain was dead, Michel Evertsen took command and decided to continue to Manila, where they would successfully sell their goods and gather information in the local fortifications. Though in Manila, one of Pessart's slaves broke out and informed the local commander about the espionage. In response, the Spanish administration would confiscate Dend Gode Haab and imprison its crew.\nAfterwords the new governor of Tranquebar, Willem Leyel, would try to get the Danish seamen out of captivity, but seemingly without prevail.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCattle War – Conflict between Danish India and the Thanjavur Maratha kingdom\nSiege of Dansborg (1644) – Siege in Tranquebar, India 1644\nWillem Leyel's siege of Dansborg – Siege of Fort Dansborg, 1644\nRoland Crappé's raids on Portuguese colonies – Danish raids in India and Sri Lanka, 1619\nAssault on Osu – 1678 Attack on Osu between Akwamu and Accrans forces\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Eva Dwiana (born 25 April 1970) is an Indonesian politician who is the current mayor of Bandar Lampung. Before becoming mayor, she served as a provincial legislator in Lampung, being elected for two terms. She is the wife of her predecessor as mayor, Herman Hasanusi.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nEva Dwiana was born in Bandar Lampung (then known as Tanjung Karang) on 25 April 1970. Her father, Iskandar Zulkarnaen, originated from Muara Enim, while her mother Dahniar hailed from West Sumatra. She studied in Bandar Lampung, graduating from the city's Petra High School in 1990. She would later receive a degree at the Indonesian Entrepreneur University.\nShe married Herman Hasanusi, who was elected mayor of Bandar Lampung in 2010, and the couple has 4 children. Her eldest son died at age 14 after returning from an umrah pilgrimage, and Eva in 2007 created a women's organisation named in her son's honor.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nPrior to Eva ran as a candidate for the Lampung Regional House of Representatives in the 2014 legislative election as a member of PDI-P, and was elected with 19,818 votes. She was sworn in on 1 September 2014. In the 2019 election, Eva ran for a second term and was reelected with 86,258 votes, the highest of all candidates for the provincial legislature.\nIn the 2020 mayoral election, with her husband at his term limit, Eva received the support of PDI-P, Nasdem and Gerindra to run as mayor. Her running mate was Dedi Amrullah, a former civil servant. The pair defeated two other candidates after winning 249,241 votes (57.3%). However, the central General Elections Commission initially disqualified her candidacy after the election citing large-scale administrative violations. In January 2021, the Supreme Court of Indonesia overturned the disqualification. Eva was sworn in as mayor on 26 February 2021, becoming the first female mayor of Bandar Lampung. Following her inauguration, she named COVID-19 handling and flood management as the focus of her tenure.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Red Sun Rising: Based on the Legend of the Death Touch, or just Red Sun Rising, is a 1994 fantasy martial arts film directed by Francis Megahy, starring Don \"The Dragon\" Wilson, James Lew, Terry Farrell, Mako and Michael Ironside. Simpson plays a Japanese cop who travels to Los Angeles and teams up with a reluctant American counterpart (Farrell) to track down the gang responsible for the murder of his partner, whose hitman (Lew) is an expert in the ancient art of the death touch.\nWidely regarded as a step up in class compared to Wilson's bread-and-butter work for producers such as Roger Corman, it is held as his best film by many reviewers and by the actor himself.: 0:27 \n\n\n== Plot synopsis ==\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nThe impetus for the film came from Don Wilson and friend Chris Penn's desire to work together again. Wilson brought the project to Paul Maslak, editor of Inside Kung Fu and his manager of four years. Maslak and Neva Friedenn, a veteran martial arts film distributor and PR, had co-produced Wilson's previous vehicle Out for Blood with PM Entertainment, and the pair was now looking to branch out into production full time. Red Sun Rising would be the first project of their new outfit Maslak/Friedenn Films. Executive producer Ashok Amritraj was not involved in the creative phase and joined the film later.: 3:09  He kept a hands off approach but helped them get the best possible cast for their budget, and was crucial to the film's financing, notably securing favorable terms on their completion bond thanks to his proven track record.: 8:12 \nBritish director Francis Megahy was recommended for the project by his agent, who was also a personal friend. It was his American feature debut. He had shot his share of fisticuffs on the 1988 Pierce Brosnan vehicle Taffin, but never such intricately choreographed martial arts. He was happy to delegate oversight of those scenes to Maslak, Wilson and their fight coordinator of choice, Art Camacho. He was given a batch of tapes to pick a cinematographer, and chose Jim Newby, who was the producers' preferred option. Newby came to the project with his wife, first assistant director Erica Fox. Editor John Weidner was picked by Maslak, and returned from Out for Blood and Ring of Fire.\n\n\n=== Writing ===\nThe basic pitch, which came from Penn, was for a \"reverse Black Rain\" where a Japanese cop traveled to the U.S. and allied with a begrudging local officer.: 4:31 : 6:57  Ever since learning that the current Japanese police descended from reformed samurai, Maslak had wanted to retell their ancestral rivalry against the ninja in the context of a modern cop film. Maslak and Penn's ideas were merged to form the basis of Red Sun Rising.: 3:43  Robert Easter, the companion of producer Neva Friedenn, was tasked with fleshing out the premise into a full screenplay. The family name of Wilson's character, Hoshino, is his Japanese mother's maiden name. When Penn departed the project, Maslak suggested making the American sidekick a woman to add romantic depth to their relationship, although her dialogue relating to the main plot was left largely unchanged.\nMaslak added the concept of the dim mak ('death touch'), which is more Chinese than Japanese, to the story due to the sheer narrative possibilities it offered.: 7:53  While the death touch is largely regarded as a folk belief, and Wilson acknowledges it as fictional, Camacho insists that some lethal punching techniques do exist. However, what is shown in the film was invented by him and James Lew.: 2:05  In the original script, Jaho was strictly a violent figure who beat up everybody, women included, and did not display the ambiguous seductiveness seen in James Lew's eventual portrayal.: 3:00  \n\n\n=== Casting ===\nChris Penn, was originally going to co-star as the American cop, dragged his feet to sign his contract after he was cast in True Romance, and confessed to Wilson that his agent asked him to hold out from participating in lower-budget films. Ashok Amritraj recommended Terry Farrell as his female replacement.: 11:00  Michael Ironside took the role of Farrell's superior as a favor, when mutual friend Steve James contacted him on Wilson's behalf. The Canadian veteran was still compensated to the tune of $10,000 per day.\nFor main antagonist Jaho, Amritraj initially suggested Jet Li (who was not yet widely known in the U.S.), but he was not available. Despite having already played a number of parts, James Lew received an \"introducing\" credit to signify his first role as a main antagonist. He was friends with Wilson and the publisher of Inside Kung Fu,: 9:14  as well as a student of acting coach Ivana Chubbuck, who had previously mentored Maslak.: 9:47  It was Chubbuck who suggested that he wear colored contact lenses for the role.: 4:10 \nAccording to Wilson, he had to enforce his creative control clause over both Farrell and Lew's casting, against the opinion of Maslak, who favored more stereotypical looks. This led to the severing of the two men's relationship after the film.: 54:04  Maslak, however, presented their breakup as the natural byproduct of his decision to expand his horizons as a producer.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nRed Sun Rising was budgeted at $2 million. Photography took place between June 14 and July 10, 1993. The film was shot in the Los Angeles area, and production used a studio located inside the former Queen of Angels Hospital. The Kyoto-set prologue was shot at the Japanese Garden of the Donald C. Tillman Water Reclamation Plant in Van Nuys, another popular filming location. The film employed close to 80 stunt persons.: 0:15  Among those working on it behind the scenes was Gerry Blanck, a Floridian acquaintance of the Wilson brothers and fellow kickboxing champion. Michael Ironside experienced a serious scare on his way to the set when he rolled over his Mercedes-Benz, but escaped unscathed. Wilson also battled through an illness during the shoot.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Pre-release ===\nDuring production, a theatrical release was considered for November or December 1993, although the odds were always tipped in favor of a video release. To promote the film, Inside Kung Fu, the magazine where the film's principals worked, ran a cover story in the November 1994 issue of its spinoff publication Martial Arts Movies, hailing it as \"The Motion Picture Born Inside the Pages of Inside Kung Fu\". It also contained an interview of Don Wilson by Timothy Baker.\n\n\n=== Television ===\nIn the U.S., Red Sun Rising premiered on premium cable channel HBO on September 1, 1994, as part of their \"HBO World Premiere\" lineup, whose name Maslak had helped to coin. The film was a success, scoring a 2.3 national rating and ranking as the 4th most watched pay cable program of the week in the country. According to Maslak, it was the highest rated HBO World Premiere of the year.\n\n\n=== Home video ===\nThe term \"World Premiere\" employed by HBO was only loosely defined, and the film had in fact already appeared in some international markets such as the U.K., where it arrived on VHS through distributor Guild Home Video on August 12, 1994. In the U.S., the film came to home video courtesy of Imperial Entertainment on April 11, 1995, apparently delayed from a March 28 date. It reached Canada shortly before on March 21.\nOn September 27, 2022, film preservationists Vinegar Syndrome re-issued the film on a Blu-ray struck from a new master, with specially commissioned special features and further bonus material drawn from an earlier German pressing.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nRed Sun Rising received a 10th anniversary screening at the Temecula Valley International Film & Music Festival on September 13, 2003, in presence of leading man Wilson and director Megahy.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nRed Sun Rising has received positive reviews. Writing for News Publications' TV Guide and Motion Picture Annual, Brian Camp said: \"While still a low-budget potboiler with a far-fetched story line, Red Sun Rising is far superior to most similar efforts, including Roger Corman’s ongoing series of Bloodfist films.\" He deemed that \"the film benefits from tight direction and editing\". Wilson's acting was said to have \"gradually improved to the point of adequacy\", while Farrell combined \"a sense of humor and a warm, feminine side\" and Lew made for \"an imposing and formidable villain\". The BBC's Radio Times rated the film three stars and said: \"There were high hopes at one point in the nineties that Don 'The Dragon' Wilson could cross over into the mainstream. [...] Sadly he faded from sight but this remains one of his stronger efforts, boasting a better-than-average script that still finds room for astonishing martial arts sequences.\" Writing for his syndicated Video view column, British reviewer Peter Dean wrote that the film \"[has] got a better-than-average screenplay and the action sequences are well choreographed.\" Anne Wheeler, home video columnist for magazine Hit Parader, was most positive and simply hailed Red Sun Rising as \"the best American martial arts film ever made\", with particular mention for Lew's villainous turn.\nIn his examination of director Francis Megahy's career for the compendium Directors in British and Irish Cinema, Robert Murphy was more moderate, calling it \"an enjoyable if routine Japanese martial arts vehicle for Don 'The Dragon' Wilson\". Ballantine Books' Video Movie Guide was along the same lines, assessing that \"[e]ntertaining players rise above pedestrian material in this modest martial arts saga, starring the always appealing Don “The Dragon” Wilson [...] Mystical elements are played too broadly, but the formula still works.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRed Sun Rising at IMDb \nRed Sun Rising at AllMovie",

        "content": "Arminta Victoria Scott Haensler (1842–1931) was an American physician, lecturer, and author. In Pennsylvania, she was resident physician to the Mission hospital; gynaecologist to the Stockton sanitarium; consulting gynaecologist to the Pennsylvania asylum for the insane; and consulting physician to the Woman's Christian Association. She served with distinction as lecturer to the Woman's Christian Association; and lecturer to the Working Women's Club.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nArminta Victoria Scott was born in Kinsman, Ohio, July 27, 1842. Her maiden name was Scott, and her parents were of Scotch-American extraction. Her father, a teacher, married one of his pupils. Of this union, Haensler was the third child. She had more trials during her childhood than at any time since, owing to her parents' belief in and practice of \"good wholesome restraint\" and her own intense dislike of being curbed or controlled. She became converted to Christianity at the age of 11.\nAt that early age, she showed an excellent memory and an aptitude for mathematics. She entered Kinsman Academy at the age of 14, doing domestic service in the family of a Presbyterian minister for her board. She made rapid progress in study and began to teach when she was 18 years old. Her attention was turned to medicine by reading a newspaper article concerning Elizabeth Blackwell and her trials in securing a medical education. Haensler then determined to be a physician in some large city, and put all her energy into earning the money and preparing herself for the medical profession. She taught for six years.\nAt the age of 24, she entered the Western Reserve Seminary (West Farmington, Ohio), and a year later, she went to Oberlin College, from which she graduated (1871, Classical, A.B.; 1874, M.A.). There, she helped in household work as an equivalent for her board. After some months, she went to the Ladies' Hall, where, during the rest of the course, she taught both private pupils and college classes. Though she subsequently received the offer of an excellent position, not only as teacher, but as reviewer, editor and reporter, Haensler entered the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania, from which, in 1875, she received the degree of M.D.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSince then, Haensler practiced in Philadelphia and at different times, held the positions of resident physician of the Mission Hospital, gynaecologist to the Stockton Sanitarium, consulting gynaecologist to the Pennsylvania Asylum for the Insane, consulting physician to the Woman's Christian Association, lecturer to the Woman's Christian Association, lecturer to the Working Women's Club, member of the Philadelphia Clinical Society, member of the Philadelphia Electro-Therapeutic Society, member of the Alumni Association of the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania, resident physician to the Franklin Reformatory Home for Women, physician to the Hospital and Dispensary for Women and Children, and lecturer before the National Woman's Health Association of America.\nHaensler was the author of a lecture on Alaska, which area was among the many she visited. She was also the author of several articles on medical topics.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOn November 13, 1890, she married Franz Joseph Haensler, M.D., of Philadelphia.\nFor the last 12 years of her life, Haensler resided in San Diego, California, where she died December 23, 1931.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Works related to Woman of the Century/Arminta Victoria Scott Haensler at Wikisource",

        "content": "Piotrowice (German: Petrowitz, Czech: Petrovice) is a part of Katowice, located in the southwestern part of the city, in the Piotrowice-Ochojec district.\nIt is one of the oldest settlements within the modern boundaries of Katowice, with its history dating back to the historic settlement of Uniczowy. The first mention of the village of Piotrowice appears in a document from the mid-15th century. Until the early 20th century, Piotrowice was a typical agricultural settlement, where mills were also operating, including several on the Ślepotka river. Over time, the village transformed into an industrial settlement, and the population grew, along with the development of educational and cultural activities. In 1907, a factory for mining machinery – later known as Famur – was established in Piotrowice. In April 1951, Piotrowice were incorporated into Katowice, and during the times of the Polish People's Republic, new residential estates were built in the district: Targowisko and Odrodzenia.\nThe main thoroughfares of Piotrowice are: Tadeusza Kościuszki Street (part of the national road 81), Armii Krajowej Street, and Zygmunt Walter-Janke Street. Additionally, the northern part of the settlement is crossed by a railway line, where the Katowice Piotrowice train station is located – the station building itself is the seat of the Iron Theater. Piotrowice is home to various types of enterprises, and it also houses the Police School in Katowice and the Wojciech Korfanty University of Silesia.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nPiotrowice are located in the southwestern part of the city, within the Piotrowice-Ochojec district. They border Zadole and Ochojec to the north, Murcki to the east, Kostuchna to the south, and Zarzecze to the west. Geographically, Piotrowice lie in the mesoregion of the Katowice Upland (341.13), and historically, they are situated in the eastern part of Upper Silesia.\nThe historical gmina of Piotrowice extended beyond the village itself and included areas such as Zadole, Ochojec, and Kostuchna. Within Piotrowice, there were several settlements and neighborhoods, including Skały, Piasek, Kempa, Zadole, Skotnica, Targowisko, Gać, and Kąty, as well as colonies like Kostuchna and Ochojec. The northern border of the former gmina ran along the Ślepotka river, while the eastern boundary extended from the railway line towards Murcki. To the southeast, gmina encompassed the areas of Kostuchna, and its border with Podlesie ran along a stream flowing into the Mleczna river along today's Stabika Street. To the west, there are Kąty, bordering Zarzecze.\nGeologically, Piotrowice are situated in the Upper Silesian Depression, filled with Carboniferous deposits (mainly conglomerates, sandstones, and clay shales containing black coal seams). The district is located in three morphogenetic units: the northern part lies within the Kłodnica Trough, which is a tectonic depression formed in Carboniferous rocks. The areas of Piotrowice along the Mleczna river valley are part of the Upper Mleczna Depression, while the eastern part of Piotrowice is situated on the Murcki Plateau, composed of Carboniferous formations.\nThe climate of Piotrowice is generally similar to that of Katowice as a whole, with local modifications (microclimate). It has a transitional temperate climate with oceanic currents prevailing over continental ones. The district lies within the drainage basin of two main river systems in Poland: the Vistula and the Oder, with a drainage divide of the first order running between them. The southern part of the district is part of the Vistula basin, drained by the Mleczna river, while the northern part flows into the Kłodnica river through the Ślepotka.\nIn terms of natural structure, greenery plays a significant role in Piotrowice, with tree plantations along streets, courtyard greenery, cemeteries, squares, and parks. Ruderal communities have developed in urban habitats, covering the entire district. The southern areas also feature vegetation typical of agricultural land, while the eastern part includes mixed forests and forestry areas. There is a shortage of publicly accessible green spaces in Piotrowice for daily recreation, and there are no district-level parks. The only natural monument in Piotrowice is a common pear tree growing at 10c Artur Grottger Street.\nTo the east of Piotrowice lies the Ochojec nature reserve, established in 1982 to protect mountain plants with a relict range in the Upper Silesia region. It covers over 25 hectares of a vast forest complex in the Ślepotka valley.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Until the 19th century ===\n\nThe oldest traces of hamlets in the area of present-day Piotrowice date back to the Neolithic period (about 5,000 years ago). They were discovered between 1925 and 1938 in the northern outskirts, near the border with Ochojec, in the valley of the Ślepotka river. It was a hamlet of the pre-Lusatian culture, characterized by knowledge of fire and pottery; flint tools were also excavated.\nThe first historical mention in documents about the areas of modern Piotrowice dates back to 1287 and comes from a document issued in Rybnik by the Racibórz duke, Mieszko I. This document mentions, among other things, the forest called Popowe Kąty, located north of Głęboki Dół and east of the road to Zarzecze. This forest was situated in the area of Kąty Piotrowickie.\nPiotrowice themselves are one of the oldest settlements within the boundaries of modern Katowice. Together with Podlesie and Zarzecze, they formed one village called Uniczowy. Over time, these villages became independent, initially being referred to together with the designation Uniczowy. However, the old name Uniczowy gradually fell into oblivion, surviving only in the name of one of Katowice's streets – Uniczowska Street.\nThe first mention of the estate village of Piotrowice dates back to the mid-15th century when the then Pszczyna duke, Janusz Raciborski, granted the free Schultheiß of Piotrowice (Petrowicz-Uniczowa) named Piotr Ostrzeżony the right to own a tavern, mill, fishponds, and land. The name Piotrowice presumably derives from the name of the Schultheiß, Piotr, who became a free Schultheiß and received the hereditary function of the Schultheiß. After Podlesie and Zarzecze became independent, the owners of Piotrowice were the Promnitz family, followed by successive owners of the Pszczyna land – the Anhalt-Köthen dukes and the Hochbergs.\nIn a document of sale of the Duchy of Pless issued by Casimir II in Czech language in Fryštát on 21 February 1517, the village was mentioned as Petrowicze Vnicziowy (or Petrowicze Unitzowy). In documents from the 16th century concerning Piotrowice, the term Uniczowy was no longer predominantly used. According to the Pszczyna urbarium from 1593, Piotrowice had 10 peasants, the Schultheiß Maciej, and 5 cottagers. There was also a mill belonging to the Schultheiß at that time. In 1629, there was a tavern in Piotrowice, and in the early 18th century, there were four such establishments.\n\nOn 28 August 1644, during the Thirty Years' War, a battle between Swedish forces and combined forces gathered under an agreement between the Pszczyna duke Zygfryd II Promnitz and the Kraków bishop Piotr Gembicki took place in the vicinity of Piotrowice. These forces assembled near Tychy. One of the two squads under Żogoła's command moved towards Piotrowice, attacking the Swedish staff camp located in the village. These forces pushed the Swedes towards Mikołów. Still in the same year, a chapel was built on the graves of the fallen soldiers in the area of today's 3 Artur Grottger Street.\nIn the 17th century, the area of Piotrowice was much larger than it is today. From a preserved document issued on 22 July 1649 in Pszczyna, it can be inferred that Piotrowice bordered directly on Mysłowice, Załęże, and Kuźnica Bogucka. In the mid-17th century, the village had a farmstead in today's Ochojec and a colony – present-day Zadole. From the 17th century, there were three watermills in Piotrowice: two on the Ślepotka and one in the center of the village, on the Mleczna river, then called Dupina.\nFrom the mid-18th century, the development of the village occurred due to the opening of a trade route leading from Mikołów to Mysłowice, which was used, among other things, for the transport of salt from Wieliczka. Piotrowice were a border village of the Pszczyna land, and at the border between Piotrowice and Ochojec, there was a customs checkpoint for road tariffs. In 1795, there was a mill on the Ślepotka in Piotrowice, owned by Jan (Jonek) Gruszka.\n\n\n=== From the 19th century to World War II ===\nIn the 19th century, the village already had close to 800 inhabitants – in 1830, Piotrowice counted 751 residents. The first school was established in 1819 (or 1818), where Karol Miarka – a writer and national activist – taught from 1847 to 1850. Efforts to build a new school began in 1856. On 28 June 1885, a fire broke out, destroying the school and several neighboring houses.\nIn 1874, during the Prussian administrative reform, administrative districts were established, comprising several gminas and manorial areas – Amtsbezirk. An administrative district called Piotrowice (German: Amtsbezirk Petrowitz) was established, including the rural gminas of Ligota, Piotrowice and the Piotrowice manorial area. Apart from the village itself, the Piotrowice gmina also included Kostuchna, while the Piotrowice manorial area included, among others, the Ochojec hamlet.\n\nIn 1879, a road connecting Mikołów with Katowice through Piotrowice was built. The Piotrowice section of this road is the present-day Zygmunt Walter-Janke Street.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Piotrowice began to change from an agricultural village to an industrial settlement. In 1910, it already had about 3,500 inhabitants, some of whom found employment in industry and mining. This gave rise to organized union, political, and cultural activities in the gmina. In the same year, a branch of the Polish Trade Union was established in Piotrowice, and a cell of the Polish Socialist Party, founded in 1908, was also active. Branches of the People's Libraries Society were organized. Already from 1912, the Jutrzenka Singing Society (established in 1911), the Peasant Council, and from 1920, the Union of Polish Women's Societies and the Sokół movement operated here. The cultural center then became the park in Zadole, with an amphitheater. On the other hand, some German residents, especially teachers and officials, were involved in the German Eastern Marches Society, an organization whose programmatic goal was to promote German culture.\n\nOn 19 February 1919, at the initiative of Piotr Gierlotka and Karol Stabik, a branch of the Polish Military Organization of Upper Silesia was established in Piotrowice and Kostuchna. The Piotrowice's Polish Military Organization group was transformed into an insurgent company of the 1st Pszczyna Regiment, 2nd Battalion, under the command of Leopold Kocma. In Piotrowice, on 18 June 1919, a meeting of the Polish Military Organization commanders of the Pszczyna County was held, demanding the start of the uprising in June 1919. A meeting was also organized in Piotrowice on August 12 of the same year. On 17 August 1919, the First Silesian Uprising broke out. In Piotrowice, a group of insurgents gathered to join forces with the Polish Military Organization group from Kostuchna. In the forests near Czułów, there was an exchange of fire between insurgents and Grenzschutz units. The Second Silesian Uprising broke out on 19 August 1920. The day after, a group of insurgents from Piotrowice launched an attack in the forest on a 15-person unit of the German Sicherheitspolizei passing along the Mikołów road. In the 1921 Upper Silesia plebiscite, 89% of the inhabitants of the gmina and almost all the inhabitants of the manorial area (58 against 1 vote) voted for Upper Silesia's affiliation with Poland. The Third Silesian Uprising took place on the night of May 2 to 3, 1921. Piotr Gierlotka was the commander of the insurgents from Piotrowice, and Wilhelm Widuch was the commander of the company. This company was part of the 1st Battalion of the Pszczyna Regiment. The insurgents fought, among other places, in Strzebniów and under the St. Anne Mountain. After the uprisings, Piotrowice became part of Second Polish Republic, in the autonomous Silesian Voivodeship.\nIn the interwar period, the village underwent expansion. New houses were built, including along today's Armii Krajowej and Walter-Janke streets. As early as 1907, a factory for mining equipment and machinery (later known as Famur) was established here. In 1933, the Piast cinema started operating. In 1936, a Catholic parish under the patronage of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus was established in Piotrowice. In 1938, part of the Piotrowice gmina was incorporated into Katowice, while the remaining part, on 1 April (or in March) 1939, by decision of the Silesian Parliament, changed its administrative affiliation from Pszczyna County to Katowice County.\n\n\n=== World War II and the postwar period ===\nDuring the German occupation of Poland, secret scouting operated in Piotrowice under the leadership of Karol Kornas, who was arrested by the Germans and executed in Berlin in 1942, and the Union of Armed Struggle, later the Home Army. Among those active in Piotrowice were the brothers Bolesław and Władysław Wiechuła, who currently lend their names to one of the streets. Near the railway station, in the Rail Rolling Stock Repair Workshops buildings, the occupiers organized a labor camp for prisoners of Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian nationality.\n\nAfter 1945, Piotrowice began to develop again. The first high school was opened: the Polygraphic School Complex, the Piotrowice Machinery Factory (later Famur) was expanding, and the population was increasing – right after World War II, it reached a level of 10,000 people in the entire gmina. On 1 April 1951, Katowice County was abolished, and at the same time, the gmina of Piotrowice was incorporated into Katowice. Despite this fact, the Civil Registry Office continued to operate in Piotrowice; marriages were performed, and death records were kept until 1974, when the Piotrowice Civil Registry Office was closed. However, Piotrowice have never been an administrative district. In the division established on 5 October 1954, Piotrowice were included in the Ligota administrative district. The division of Katowice into districts was abolished in 1973.\n\nDue to the increase in the number of inhabitants, new residential blocks and estates were built. In the 1970s, residential blocks were built on Tadeusz Kościuszko Street, and in the 1980s, the Silesia housing cooperative was established in Piotrowice, under which the Targowisko housing estate was built in that decade, on the site of the former gmina market (between Szewska, Jastrzębia, Zbożowa, Targowa, and Janke streets) and the Żurawia housing estate (Żurawia and Sobocińskiego streets). On the border with Ochojec, on the site of former farmlands, a residential estate was built for 20,000 residents: the Odrodzenia housing estate. Meanwhile, individual construction was developing, and since the 1990s, also developer-led construction. The area between Aleksander Kostka-Napierski and Głuszców streets and along K. Kornas and Father Stanisław Wilczewski streets was developed for the construction of terraced houses.\nOn 16 September 1991, the City Council of Katowice adopted a resolution dividing Katowice into 22 auxiliary self-government units and 22 areas of their operation. At that time, local government unit No. 19 Ochojec – Piotrowice (later the Piotrowice-Ochojec district) was also established, including Piotrowice.\nOn 21 November 2001, the viaduct over Armii Krajowej Street was put into use, which now serves as a railway traffic route. In the 1980s and 1990s, barriers before the then-operating railway-road crossing in Piotrowice were down for 13–14 hours a day, and the waiting time for cars at the crossing reached 50 minutes or more. On 12 April 2021, with the participation of Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and the Mayor of Katowice Marcin Krupa, a road junction at the intersection of T. Kościuszki and Armii Krajowej streets was opened. The modernization works began in 2018, and as part of this investment, a two-level intersection of streets was created, with the national road 81 passing below.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nIn 1840, there were 42 houses in Piotrowice, with 751 people living in them, while in 1871, the gmina counted 1,403 individuals, of which 1,073 were born in Piotrowice and 330 arrived from elsewhere. In terms of religious affiliation, Roman Catholics dominated the population with 1,382 individuals. Additionally, there were 9 Evangelicals and 12 Jews. In 1910, during the Prussian census, 3,659 people in Piotrowice spoke only Polish, 304 spoke German, and 3 spoke both languages. In 1934, the gmina of Piotrowice, which also included Ochojec, part of Kostuchna, Zadole, and Kąty, was home to 8,195 inhabitants, including 86 Evangelicals and 11 Jews. The gmina of Piotrowice had 8,066 residents in 1936. After World War II, there were about 7,500 people living in Piotrowice and around 10,000 in the entire gmina.\n\nThe chart below illustrates the demographic development of the village and later gmina of Piotrowice from 1629 to 1938:Data sources: 1629; 1780; 1825; 1840 (according to another source, the same number of residents was recorded in 1830); 1861; 1871; 1885; 1891; 1900 (according to another source, there were 2,053 residents in 1900); 1905 (according to another source, there were 2,931 people in the municipality at that time); 1910 (according to another source, Piotrowice had 3,500 residents at that time); 1931; 1934; 1938.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe beginnings of industry in Piotrowice date back to the 20th century. In 1907, a factory producing mining machinery was established here, which later became one of the largest metalworking plants. From 1930, this factory was named the Piotrowice Machinery Factory. It employed about 80–250 workers. In 1966, the plant changed its name to Famur. The Piotrowice Machinery Factory Famur underwent further modernization in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1975, it produced 168 mining combines, 700 pumps, and 350 hydraulic engines. During this time, the plant was among the world's leading manufacturers of mining equipment.\n\nWith the establishment of the gmina, craftsmanship also developed in Piotrowice. At the beginning of the 20th century, workshops for all basic crafts were operating here. There were several forges here even in the 19th century. Additionally, before World War I, various trades had their workshops here: carpenters, electricians, cobblers, bakers, tailors, butchers, and hairdressers. After World War I, the Boronowski family opened the Gloria photographic studio on Kasztanowa Street, and their sons became professional photographers. A photographic studio was also established at 167 Walter-Janke Street. From 1923, there was also a stonemason's workshop in Piotrowice run by Józef Mendecki, and after World War II by his son. During the interwar period, there was also a concrete plant here. Additionally, there were two breweries and mineral water bottling plants, as well as canned food production. In the early 1960s, a fruit and vegetable market was established in the area of the future Targowisko housing estate. It was a 24-hour wholesale market, operating until the construction of the new residential estate in its place.\nPiotrowice is home to rich deposits of limestone underground, which led to the development of quarrying for these aggregates in the past. In topographic works from 1860, it was indicated that there were 26 large lime kilns operating in the Pszczyna County at that time, including in Piotrowice. In 1896, the Prince of Pszczyna issued a concession for limestone mining in Piotrowice. Lime kilns were built on both sides of the current Armii Krajowej Street, near the cemetery. The most burnt lime was sold in 1908 – 2538 m3. The last lime kiln was dismantled in 1959.\nIn 1921, the Railway Rolling Stock Repair Workshops were established in Piotrowice at the site of the Elevator iron construction plant. The workshops carried out repairs of railway wagons. After World War II, these facilities were transformed into the Railway Traffic Control and Communication Works of the Polish State Railways.\nIn 1931, between Piotrowice and Kostuchna, in the birch forest near Skotnica, bootleg mines began to emerge. Coal was extracted from them from the Emanuel field, from the 318 seam with a thickness of 2.8 m, and the shafts were dug up to a depth of 18 m. Coal mining in these mines lasted until 1938. Near the Piotrowice cemetery, the Murcki Coal Mine began construction of the Zygmunt ventilation shaft in October 1983. This shaft was put into use on 28 February 1989.\nCommercial and service facilities in Piotrowice nowadays concentrate around the intersection of the main streets within the transformed former village area – in this case, it's the intersection of Armii Krajowej and Walter-Janke streets.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nThe main transportation artery in Piotrowice is national road 81, along which Tadeusz Kościuszko Street runs through the district. This road serves as an exit southward towards Mikołów, Żory, and Skoczów. It also provides a direct connection between Piotrowice and Śródmieście. This road intersects with Armii Krajowej Street, which runs north–south. Armii Krajowej Street is a county road classified as a collector road (Z) and connects Piotrowice from the north with Ligota through Zadole, and to the south with Kostuchna and Podlesie. In the center of Piotrowice, Armii Krajowej Street intersects with another important road in the district: Walter-Janke Street. It connects the western part of Piotrowice – Kąty Piotrowickie with Ochojec and further with Brynów. This street is also a county road of class Z. Other important roads in Piotrowice include Aleksander Kostka-Napierski Street, Father Stanisław Wilczewski Street, and Wojska Polskiego Street.\n\nIn Piotrowice, there is a railway junction where railway lines from Katowice diverge in two directions: towards Bielsko-Biała and Rybnik, and further to Zebrzydowice and the state border. The lines passing through the Piotrowice area are: 139 Katowice – Zwardoń and 140 Katowice Ligota – Nędza. The first railway route in Piotrowice was opened on 20 January 1858. It was a section of railway that connected Mikołów with Ligota (now Katowice Ligota) over a distance of 9 km (or it was the opening of the line between Ligota and Orzesze on 30 April 1856). This route was built by the Wilhelm Railway Company. On the orders of the president of the Opole Region, this line was extended to Katowice. After connecting Katowice with Mikołów through Piotrowice, 22 trains ran daily.\nIn 1900, construction began on a line connecting Katowice to Tychy through Piotrowice. The first trains were launched in 1910 – due to unstable embankments built on former ponds, initially only light freight trains operated. Passenger trains started running in 1912 (the opening of the line between Ligota and Tychy took place on 2 November 1902), and only after World War I did trains to Tychy stop in Piotrowice as well.\n\nKatowice Piotrowice train station was opened in 1895. The platform was then located on the eastern side of the street towards Ligota, and a gatekeeper's building was erected at the platform, where tickets were also sold – over 3,000 tickets were sold in the first year. Construction of the railway station building at the Piotrowice stop began in 1912.\nThe peak of railway traffic through Piotrowice was at the end of the 1980s, and in the 1990s, this traffic decreased in favor of car transport. The level crossing with Armii Krajowej Street was a nuisance. In 1999, construction of viaducts under this street began. Car traffic under the new viaducts was opened on 21 November 2001.\nThe organizer of urban public transport in Piotrowice is the Metropolitan Transport Authority, and public transport within the settlement boundaries is provided solely by bus connections. The main carriers on routes passing through Piotrowice are: the Municipal Transport Company in Katowice and the Municipal Transport Company in Tychy.\nThere are a total of 13 stops in Piotrowice: Piotrowice Barcelońska, Piotrowice Bukszpanowa Kaplica, Piotrowice Cmentarz, Piotrowice Dworzec PKP, Piotrowice Działowa, Piotrowice Fabryka Maszyn, Piotrowice Miłe Zacisze, Piotrowice Osiedle, Piotrowice Pętla, Piotrowice Skrzyżowanie, Piotrowice Szkoła, Piotrowice Tyska, and Piotrowice Wojska Polskiego. At the four-stop Piotrowice Skrzyżowanie located in the center of Piotrowice, at the intersection of Armii Krajowej and Walter-Janke streets, according to the state from mid-May 2022, 9 bus lines, including one night line, stopped. These lines connect Piotrowice with other parts of Katowice, and some of them also with other cities in the Metropolis GZM: with Czeladź, Mikołów, Mysłowice, and Tychy.\n\n\n== Architecture and urbanism ==\n\n\n=== Urban development ===\n\nThe earliest settlement in Piotrowice was located in the valley of the Mleczna river. The historical center of the settlement, where the first houses were located, is marked by Kasztanowa, Świerkowa, and Wojska Polskiego streets. These streets were part of the old trade route known as Furmańce. Traditional construction in the 18th and 19th centuries mainly consisted of wooden buildings with log construction and a two-room interior layout, with a foundation inscription and construction date placed above the lintel. Houses were also built of bricks and stone, covered with roof tiles. In 1830, there were a total of 42 houses in Piotrowice.\n\nThe oldest building in Piotrowice, dating back to the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, is a village residential house located at 1 Załogowa Street. In addition, among the oldest buildings in Piotrowice, with a history dating back to the second half of the 19th century, are houses located on the following streets: 28 Artur Grottger, 15 Aleksander Kostka-Napierski, 183 and 216 Walter-Janke, and 48 Wojska Polskiego. In the early 20th century, Piotrowice began to transform from a village into a suburban settlement. With the increase in the number of village residents, multi-story, brick, and plastered houses began to be built. The development built between 1900 and 1922 is located in various parts of Piotrowice, mainly concentrated around the streets: Karol Darwin, Kasztanowa, Artur Grottger, Walter-Janke, and Wojska Polskiego. Significant urban development occurred in Piotrowice in the interwar period. New construction emerged along Armii Krajowej Street and Walter-Janke Street. After 1934, over 200 houses were built annually.\n\nDuring the Polish People's Republic, the first residential blocks in Piotrowice began to be built in the second half of the 1960s between T. Kościuszko Street and Żurawia Street. In the 1970s, the Department of Architecture, together with the Provincial Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, prepared plans to demolish historic houses to build a modern center of Katowice. Due to local committee actions and the economic crisis in 1982, these plans were abandoned. Nevertheless, demolitions for new construction occurred – most notably in the Skotnica area and at the market square.\nIn March 1977, construction began on the Targowisko housing estate, located in the area of A. Fredro and Walter-Janke streets. It was designed by Zygmunt Fagas and was built until 1980. Individual and cooperative housing construction in the form of single-family houses also developed.\nIn the early 1980s, on the border between Piotrowice and Kostuchna, in the area of Tyska, S. Łętowski, A. Kostka-Napierski, and M. Radocki streets, construction began on the Odrodzenia housing estate, designed by a team of architects from Wrocław in cooperation with the Katowice Inwestprojekt. Construction work on the estate began in 1979. It was part of an architectural-urban design from the late 1970s, envisioning the construction of a large complex of residential estates for 120,000 people.\n\n\n=== Monuments and memorial plaques ===\nIn Piotrowice, there were or are the following memorial sites:\n\nA chapel built in 1922 to commemorate the annexation of part of Upper Silesia to Poland, on the site of the graves of soldiers who died during the Thirty Years' War; inside the chapel, there is a plaque commemorating the residents of Piotrowice who died in the Second and Third Silesian Uprisings (at 3 A. Grottger Street);\na plaque commemorating those who died during the Silesian Uprisings and World War II (at 64 Armii Krajowej Street; at the Polygraphic-Mechanical School Complex named after the Home Army);\na former mass grave of German soldiers at the cemetery on Armii Krajowej Street – in 2007, exhumations were carried out to transfer the remains to the German soldiers' cemetery in Siemianowice Śląskie on Henryk Krupanek Street.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe beginnings of education in Piotrowice date back to 1765 when the Prussian law on compulsory education came into effect. On 18 June 1810, school inspector Nygo from Mysłowice made the decision to establish a school in Piotrowice. At that time, children walked to school in Mikołów. On 19 February 1819 (or 1818), the first school building was opened in Piotrowice at the intersection of Wojska Polskiego and Armii Krajowej streets. The first teacher in the new institution was Antoni Hartmann. In 1865, a second floor and a teacher's apartment were added. On 1 July 1847, teacher Karol Miarka began working at the Piotrowice school, teaching until May 1850. Construction of a new school building in the market square area of Piotrowice, near Armii Krajowej Street, began in 1901. Teaching at the new facility commenced the following year, with four classrooms. In 1908, the school had 462 students, 15 of whom were of German descent.\n\nIn 1929, construction began on a new public school building on the present-day Walter-Janke Street. Teaching started there on 7 December 1931, and in January 1936, the school was divided into two parts: Public School No. 1 for boys and Public School No. 2 for girls. School No. 1 had 507 male students, while School No. 2 had 428 female students. In the same year, the school building was expanded towards the north. The schools were merged in 1953, creating Primary School No. 28 in Katowice.\n\nOn Armii Krajowej Street, the Vocational School began in 1950, educating students in various professions. In 1978, this school evolved into the Polygraphic-Mechanical School Complex. On 1 September 1955, teaching commenced at the Technical School of the Central Cooperative Union, located at 2 Harcerzy Września 1939 Street. This school taught the professions of photographic technician and radio-television technician. In the 1990s, the school was renamed the Edward Abramowski Vocational School Complex.\nIn January 1960, as part of the Millennium of the Polish State celebrations, Primary School No. 32 was opened in Katowice at 86 M. Sobański Street.\nIn the 1960s, modern school facilities with a swimming pool and shooting range were built for the police school. In the 1970s, units of the Motorized Reserves of the Citizens' Militia were barracked in these facilities, followed by special police units. On 8 February 1999, the Police School in Katowice was inaugurated in the premises formerly occupied by Motorized Reserves of the Citizens' Militia and later by the police anti-terrorist unit, with Tadeusz Wojtuszko appointed as its first commander.\nIn the building of the former PFM-FAMUR workers' hotel, the Upper Silesian Private College of Economics was established on 1 October 1991, which transformed into the Upper Silesian School of Commerce in 1994, with Dr. Ewa Piastowska as its first rector. On 1 June 2022, the university changed its name to the Upper Silesian Academy named after Wojciech Korfanty in Katowice.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nIn Piotrowice, until the time of World War I, the customs of a Silesian village were preserved. Folk holidays such as Kupala Night and the drowning of Morana were celebrated here.\nThe first library of the People's Libraries Society in Piotrowice was established before the outbreak of World War I, with Ludwik Widuch, the founder of the Jutrzenka choir, being its organizer. During the interwar period, the library was located at the old school in the Piotrowice market square. After the Civil Registry Office was relocated to the Katowice Wedding Palace, the premises were taken over by the Municipal Public Library. The second branch of the Municipal Public Library in Piotrowice was established in 1984 in the Odroczenie housing estate at 70a M. Radockiego Street.\nIn 1911, at the initiative of Ludwik Widuch, Piotr Gierlotka, Henryk Pieczka, and Paweł Łaskot, the Jutrzenka Singing Society was established. This group performed its first theatrical performance on 9 September 1912, in Kostuchna. Between 1912 and 1920, the society recited Polish poems and theatrical plays. During World War I, Jutrzenka suspended its activities, but in December 1918, the ensemble was reactivated. In 1935, the mixed choir Jutrzenka was reorganized, giving rise to the male choir Hejnał. At the beginning of the 21st century, Katowice was home to 13 choirs affiliated with the Polish Choirs and Orchestras Association, including the liturgical-children's-youth choir at the parish of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and St. John Bosco, and the chamber choir Fermata at the Piotrowice branch of the Municipal Cultural Center Południe in Katowice.\n\nFrom 1933 to 1991, the Piast cinema operated on Walter-Janke Street (now the Theater & Music Club Old Timers Garage).\nRoman Pająk was associated with Piotrowice. He was a painter whose oil paintings and frescoes can be found in churches throughout Europe and in private collections. He mainly painted landscapes and sacred motifs. He died on 8 July 1964, in Piotrowice. The musical band Dżem was also founded and started its career in Piotrowice.\nOne of the four branches of the Municipal Cultural Center Południe in Katowice was established in Piotrowice in 2000. In the same year, the Piotrowice branch itself was founded, housed in a renovated building formerly used as a clinic. This building had previously served as the headquarters of the Piotrowice commune office. The Południe Municipal Cultural Center organizes cultural activities in the district, offering music, dance, language courses, aerobics, and handicraft classes. It also provides facilities and equipment for amateur music groups.\nSince 2014, the headquarters of the Iron Theater has been located at 40 Armii Krajowej Street, in the former railway station building at the Katowice Piotrowice stop, which was slated for demolition. This theater has an amphitheater-style audience. Actress and dancer Edyta Herbuś took her first steps in the Iron Theater, debuting with the play Diwa, directed by Grzegorz Kempinsky. The Wojciech Korfanty Upper Silesian School of Commerce inaugurates the academic year with an event called \"Watermelon's Holiday\", conceived by Krzysztof Skiba, the leader of the Big Cyc band, open not only to the university's students.\nIn Piotrowice, there is the Museum of the Smallest Book in the World, founded by the Guinness World Record holder in this category, Zygmunt Szkocny. The museum is located at 5 Traktorzystów Street.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\nThe dominant religion in Piotrowice is Catholicism. Initially, the Roman Catholic residents of Piotrowice belonged to the parish of St. Adalbert in Mikołów, established in 1222. Attempts to build a church in Piotrowice were made from 1898 or even as early as 1870 – at that time, there were plans to establish a parish covering Piotrowice, Kostuchna, Ochojec, Murcki, and Podlesie. Meanwhile, Franciscans were brought to Upper Silesia, and a decision was made to build a monastery complex in nearby Panewniki. This was related to the Germanization policy pursued by the then Bishop of Wrocław, Georg von Kopp. The establishment of a new monastery was intended to divert people and priests from pilgrimages to Częstochowa. In 1913 (or January 1914), the population of Piotrowice came under the care of the parish in Panewniki.\n\nIn 1930, the construction of a new temporary wooden church began in Piotrowice. The consecration of the temporary church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus took place on 26 October 1930. The curacy was established on 1 May 1931, and the parish of the Sacred Heart of Jesus was established on 2 November 1936. However, construction of the proper church did not commence due to the outbreak of World War II. In 1956, preparations for the construction of the proper church resumed, but permission for the expansion was not granted. It was not until 1974 that construction of the proper church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and St. John Bosco began. It was consecrated by the then Bishop of Katowice, Herbert Bednorz, on 15 December 1977. Earlier, on 9 February 1976, the Piotrowice parish gained an additional patron – St. John Bosco. The parish cemetery of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, covering an area of 2.135 hectares, is located on Armii Krajowej Street.\nDue to the expansion of Piotrowice and the increasing number of residents, a decision was made in 1986 to build a new church in the Odrodzenia housing estate. On 10 June 1987, during his pilgrimage to Tarnów, Pope John Paul II laid the cornerstone for the construction of the new church of the Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ. The builder of the church was Father Janusz Kwapiszewski. The parish was established on 1 January 1990.\nIn Piotrowice, from 1979 to 1986, Katarzyna Szymon lived. On 8 March 1946, stigmata appeared on her body, and she often experienced visions of the Passion of Jesus in ecstasy. People from all over the world visited her.\n\n\n== Sports and recreation ==\nIn 1918, April 1919, or 1920, a branch of the Sokół movement was established in Piotrowice and Kostuchna, belonging to the Mikołów district. Jan Materla became the president of the branch. The movement conducted outdoor exercises, organized trips and marches, and as part of its educational activities, lectures and training sessions were held in Polish. Branch assemblies of Sokół were organized in Zadole. From 1922 to 1939, a total of 13 sports organizations operated in Piotrowice.\nThe first well-known football field in Piotrowice was located in Gać on the current Wspólna Street. Matches played there in the 1920s and 1930s are remembered. A more representative field was established in Skotnica – it was solemnly consecrated on 21 August 1932. The area of the former field is now occupied by allotment gardens on A. Kostka-Napierski Street. A new field was established in 1935 at the Piotrowice Machine Factory, and shortly after World War II, at the Targowisko housing estate.\nIn the early post-war years, three sports clubs were established within the boundaries of Piotrowice:\n\nMachine Factory Sports Club – active from 1946 to 1947; it had a football section and later merged with Górnik;\nZZK Railway Workers' Trade Union – active from 1948 to 1962; it had football and table tennis sections; later became part of Kolejarz;\nZKS District Trade Union Commission – a football club active in 1947; later merged with Kolejarz.\nDuring the Polish People's Republic era in the 1950s, motorcycle races were organized on the streets of Piotrowice, and every few years, the Peace Race cycling competition passed through the district. Two residents of Piotrowice participated in the Olympic Games: Wanda Kaczmarczyk in Rome in 1960 (fencer) and Henryk Nielaba in Tokyo in 1964 (fencer).\nIn 2007, there were 8 sports clubs operating in Piotrowice.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBarciak, Antoni; Chojecka, Ewa; Fertacz, Sylwester, eds.

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Satisfaction Guaranteed is a 1979 studio album by Mark Murphy.\nSatisfaction Guaranteed is the 17th album by American jazz vocalist Mark Murphy. It was recorded when Murphy was 47 years old and released by the Muse Records label in the United States in 1980. The release is a collection of contemporary tunes and standards dedicated to Eddie Jefferson. Saxophonist Richie Cole makes his second appearance on an album with Murphy. Murphy was nominated for a 1980 Grammy award for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Male at the 23rd annual awards for the album.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe recording was dedicated to Eddie Jefferson, who was shot and killed outside Baker's Keyboard Lounge in Detroit on May 8, 1979, aged 60. Both Murphy and Cole were closely associated with Jefferson. Cole performed with Jefferson on five releases on Muse and in concert. Cole was performing with Jefferson during his engagement at Baker's Keyboard Lounge and was walking out of the club with Jefferson when he was shot and killed. He composed a tribute to Jefferson, \"Eddie Jefferson\", which Murphy recorded on his album Kerouac, Then and Now. In a Down Beat feature in October 1980, Cole said, “It was easy for Eddie and I to blend our styles, because we shared the same kind of feeling. I knew Eddie for about five years. He was a master of show business and a master of music, and he definitely influenced the way I play today\". \nJefferson is credited as one of the innovators of vocalese, adding lyrics to a jazz musician's improvised solo on a tune. This had a big influence on Murphy who recorded many vocalese classics and who went on to write his own. Speaking about his career by the 1970s in an interview for The Calgary Herald, Murphy said, \"Pure jazz was really the only place that was not overcrowded, so I went there, towards where Jon Hendricks and Eddie Jefferson were, and that's where I carved my niche. I'm certainly one of the last of that era still doing it''. \n\n\n== Recording ==\nThe album was produced and arranged by Mitch Farber, a jazz saxophonist who also wrote and produced for Jackie McLean, Red Garland, Morgana King, Richie Cole, Pepper Adams, and Walter Bishop Jr. Farber produced and arranged another Mark Murphy release, Stolen Moments, also on Muse Records. \nMike Renzi, a pianist well known for working with singers Peggy Lee, Lena Horne, Mel Tormé, Cleo Laine, Blossom Dearie and Jack Jones, provides piano accompaniment for Murphy. Richie Cole, on alto saxophone, had previously worked with Murphy on Stolen Moments. Jimmy Madison, who previously worked with Murphy on Bridging a Gap, Mark II and Sings, accompanies on drums. Trumpeter Tom Harrell makes his first of three appearances on Murphy albums.\nMark Egan accompanies on bass, Ray Mantilla on percussion on track A4, Ronnie Cuber on baritone saxophone, Gene Bertoncini on guitar, Slide Hampton on trombone, and Steve Bramson is the arranger on tracks A4 and B1. The rhythm parts of \"Waltz for Debbie\", track B3, had been previously arranged for Murphy by Richard Rodney Bennett when Murphy was living in London. \nComposer Alec Wilder was present during the recording of his ballad \"Welcome Home\". Wilder had become a big Murphy supporter and had Murphy on his Peabody Award-winning NPR radio show “American Popular Song with Alec Wilder and Friends”. The appearance was released in 1977 as Mark Murphy Sings Mostly Dorothy Fields & Cy Coleman (Audiophile).\nThe medley on track A3 was devised as a tribute to Etta Jones. \"Don't Go To Strangers\" was a 1960 hit for Jones on the album Don't Go To Strangers. The album was Etta Jones' first album for the independent jazz label Prestige and the song went gold, hitting the Top 40 on the pop charts (peaking at #36 on 1960/12/17) and reaching number five on the R&B charts (1960/12/26). \"Don't Misunderstand\" was released by Jones with Houston Person on the album My Mother's Eyes for Muse Records in 1978.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nMurphy's performance on Satisfaction Guaranteed was nominated for a 1980 Grammy award for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Male at the 23rd annual awards. This was Murphy's first nomination for a vocal performance and it lost to George Benson, for Moody's Mood.\nThe Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music assigns 4 stars (meaning, \"Excellent. A high standard album from this artist and therefore highly recommended). The Rolling Stone Jazz Record Guide assigns the album four stars  (meaning, \"Excellent: Four-star albums represent peak performances in an artist's career. Generally speaking, albums that are granted four or more stars constitute the best introductions to an artist's work for listeners who are curious\").\nMurphy biographer Peter Jones calls the album a \"relaxed, accessible, warm and - as promised in the title - satisfying recording, on which Murphy is at his least self-indulgent\".\nAllMuisic assigns a score of 4 stars. Reviewer Ron Wynn wrote, \"Good '79 session with vocalist Mark Murphy putting his stamp on old standards and new tunes, scatting, vocalizing, and extending them in his fiery, dynamic way.\" \n\n\n== Track listing ==\nIssued as Vinyl LP.

It provides financing to small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs).\nOver 46K small businesses have received over $2.25B from Credibly in over 1,000 industries. Credibly also provides business lines of credit, long-term loans, and equipment loans through financing partners.\n\n\n== History ==\nCredibly, formerly known as RetailCapital LLC was founded in 2010 in Michigan by Ryan Rosett and Edan King. It has offices in Southfield, MI, New York, NY and Tempe, AZ. Credibly was founded after the 2008 financial crisis, a period after which small business owners had difficulties securing financing from traditional banks. RetailCapital LLC had a joint venture with Crestmark Bank, member FDIC, until 2014 when they received an investment from Flexpoint Ford, a private equity firm. The company's first financial offering was focused on Merchant Cash Advances (MCAs) and soon expanded to offer Working Capital Loans (WCLs).\nIn 2015, Retail Capital LLC rebranded as Credibly, expanding its product offerings to Business Expansion Loans (BXLs). The company also started offering merchants $100 million in funding year over year.\nThe company partnered with the Small Business Association of Michigan to support small businesses.\nIn 2017, Credibly repositioned its WebBank, (a Utah chartered industrial bank headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, member FDIC) loan origination program to offer loans directly through Credibly.\nIn 2023, Credibly announced a management-led buyback of all outstanding equity investment. In September 2023, Green Dot Corporation partnered with Credibly to provide applicable small business owners a business banking account service called Credibly Business Checking.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n2015 became one of New York's fastest growing companies in the Crain's New York Fast 50.\n2023 Credibly named a USA Top Workplace by Employees\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Josephine 'Jo Jo' Dullard is an Irish woman who disappeared at the age of 21 on November 9, 1995. The last confirmed sighting of her was at a public phonebox in Moone, Co. Kildare. Gardaí suspect she is dead and was murdered.\n\n\n== Background ==\nJo Jo was from Callan Co. Kilkenny and had recently returned to the area after working in Dublin for two years. She was due to start a new full-time job as a waitress on the Monday following her disappearance.\n\n\n== Disappearance ==\nOn the day of her disappearance Jo Jo travelled to Dublin by bus to sign-off social welfare and to collect her final social welfare payment as she was due to begin a new job. While in Dublin she went to Bruxelles pub on Grafton Street with friends.\nJo Jo travelled to Busáras bus station at 10pm that night but she missed her bus home to Callan. She then decided to take the bus to Kildare and disembarked at Naas at 10:50pm. She successfully hitched a lift to Kilcullen. At Kilcullen around 11:15pm she hitched a lift to Moone and arrived there at 11:35pm. While at Moone, Jo Jo used a public phonebooth to call a friend to se if she could stay in Carlow and explained how she had missed her bus. Jo Jo interrupted the call and the returned to the phone to say ‘’ she just got a lift’’. Jo Jo then ended the call. She was not seen again.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nWhen Jo Jo failed to return home, her sister Kathleen reported her disappearance 24 hours later. Two days passed before Gardaí took the notification seriously. Gardaí then searched the River Barrow and the road from Moone to Carlow.\nSightings were reported that claimed to have seen Jo Jo at Castledermot around midnight on the night of her disappearance.\nIn 1997 a witness came forward to say that on the night of the disappearance, he witnessed two men with English accents bundle a woman matching Jo Jo's description into a red car with English licsense plates at Kilmacow. The car was described a being similar to a Ford Sierra Sapphire.\nIn 2020, a witness said he saw a woman running naked and screaming through Moone on the night of Jo Jo's disappearance. The man stated he was travelling with his boss at the time and his boss left to car to follow Jo Jo but she ran away. The witness stated that his boss then rang the Gardaí from a phonebox and Gardaí stated they would send a car out. After Jo Jo was reported missing they gave a statement to Gardaí but Gardaí believed they had seen a different woman as Jo Jo had been sighted in Castledermot.\nJo Jo's disappearance has been included in Operation Trace, a Garda operation set up in 1998 to investigate cases included under the Vanishing Triangle moniker and to investigate any potential links between them.\nIn 2019 a priest in Co. Kilkenny received an anonymous letter about Jo Jo Dullard after he publicly appealed for information. The letter was handed over to Gardaí and it's contents were not revealed publicly.\nThe investigation into her disappearance was upgraded to a murder investigation in 2020 following a reinvestigation by the Garda Serious Crime Review Team.\nIn 2021 a search was conducted a search in woodland in Co. Kildare in relation to the disappearances of Jo Jo Dullard and Deirdre Jacob. Unusual activity in the area on the night of Deirdre Jacob's disappearance led to the search with the Gardaí also noting the Jo Jo Dollard was last sighted a 10-minute drive away from the search area. No evidence was found in the search.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nJo Jo's disappearance has been included and discussed in relation with a series of disappearances in Ireland known as Ireland's Vanishing Triangle. This term has been used to describe a series of disappearances of young women in the east of Ireland during the late 1980s and 1990s.\nA memorial for Jo Jo was installed in Moone at the site of the phonebox where she was last seen.\n\n\n== Media ==\nJo Jo's disappearance was highly publicised in Ireland and was included in the true crime books Missing by Barry Cummins, Missing, Presumed by Alan Bailey, and The Vanishing Triangle by Claire McGowan.\nThe 1997 alleged sighting of Jo Jo was reconstructed for the TV show Crimeline. Her disappearance was covered on Crimecall, an Irish television show which seeks public assistance in solving unsolved crimes, in 2020 and 2021.\nHer disappearance was also featured in the Sky Documentary series Six Silent Killings: Ireland's Vanishing Triangle.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==",

Ibrahim Pasha's Ottoman Egyptian troops successfully besieged and stormed the troops of Abdullah Pasha.\nThe Egyptians made the best of the time factor as per historian V. B. Lutsky. In October 1831, Ibrahim launched a military campaign. Around two to three weeks later, after not having encountered serious resistance, Egyptian troops occupied Gaza, Jaffa, Haifa, and, at the end of November 1831, advanced on Akka, the fortress which had once barred Napoleon's path in 1799. Following a six-months long siege, Akka fell to the Egyptians. By this time, the main Egyptian forces were far away in the north.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\nBodart, Gaston (1908).

        "content": "Sam Miller is an American comedian from Olympia, Washington. He has headlined across the United States, and released his debut album Round Trip on Stand Up! Records in 2023. His work is known for dealing frankly with issues of homelessness and drug addiction; Miller has been sober since 2008. Seattle magazine City Arts called Miller \"an endearingly positive presence\" in the comedy scene of the Pacific Northwest.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMiller was born in a military hospital at Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Washington. Miller's father, a lieutenant colonel in the United States Air Force, died when Miller was 12. His mother, now retired, was a psychiatric nurse practitioner. He grew up in Spanaway, Washington; after his father's death, the family moved to nearby Olympia.\nMiller began using drugs at age 14. As a teenager, Miller was arrested several times for minor drug violations and similar offenses, and was incarcerated in Yakima County Jail. After being expelled from high school, Miller worked for the U.S. Forest Service as a wilderness firefighter in the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. He lost the job because of his drug problems. He was homeless for about a decade. During this time, he worked a variety of jobs, including dishwasher, bouncer, warehouse worker, landscaper, assistant preschool teacher, bartender, and farmhand. Miller decided to get sober in 2008, and eventually worked at a youth homeless shelter. He graduated from Evergreen State College in Olympia in 2017 and became a chemical dependency counselor and public speaker on addiction recovery.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMiller's first public performance was as part of a vaudeville show in Olympia in the mid-2000s, balancing a lawnmower on his chin.\nMiller first did stand-up in 2014 at an open mic in Olympia. Much of his comedy deals with issues of homelessness, the prison system and stigmatization of drug addiction. Other topics include marriage and parenting, and living as a large person (he is 6 foot 6 and 360 pounds).\nMiller has performed across the United States. Miller took second place in the 2021 Seattle International Comedy Competition. He also competed in the 2016 SICC. He was described by a fellow competitor as \"like half grizzled sea captain and half someone who works at Build-A-Bear. You don’t know whether to be terrified or to hug him.\" Miller also  won the Seattle-based stand-up competition Comedy on Trial in 2017.\nMiller's journey from addiction to stand-up was profiled on the Seattle Times' Outsiders podcast in 2020, which looked at issues around homelessness. He also wrote about his life story in an article for Newsweek in 2023.\nIn 2017, he created and performed a multimedia stage show, The Jail Letters Project, based on correspondence between Miller and his mother while he was incarcerated in Yakima County Jail for drug-related offenses in 2003. During the show, Miller and his mother read excerpts from the letters and talked about how Miller's jail time and subsequent recovery from addiction had affected them. The project was inspired by a class on prison writing Miller took at Evergreen State College.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Miller wrote 100 new jokes a week, performing via streaming on Facebook, to raise money for homeless nonprofits.\nMiller has also produced comedy shows in Olympia, including co-founding the ongoing open mic event Vomity. He puts an emphasis on promoting diversity and inclusivity in the shows he promotes.\nAs of 2024, he is collaborating on a book with Seattle artist Pat Moriarity, who designed the album cover for Round Trip (as well as covers for bands including The Replacements and Soul Asylum).\n\n\n=== Podcasting ===\nSince 2023, Miller has co-hosted a comedy podcast, The Tarp Report, with Seattle comedian Jes Anderson. The podcast, which often deals with issues of sobriety, has produced 59 episodes as of April 2024. He has also guested several times on the syndicated radio program The Bob & Tom Show, and is a frequent guest on podcasts not only as a comedian but for his expertise in drug and homelessness issues.\n\n\n=== Recordings ===\nMiller is signed to Minneapolis comedy label Stand Up! Records. The first of three planned works on the label, the video and album Round Trip, was released October 27, 2023. Round Trip was recorded on April 23, 2022, at the Capitol Theater in Olympia—the location was chosen purposefully, as Miller's last night as a homeless person was spent across the street, in view of the theater. Round Trip reached No. 1 on the iTunes comedy chart the week of its release.\nRichard Lanoie of The Serious Comedy Site called Round Trip \"interesting and original\", and praised it as \"the best comedy album I have listened to all year.\"\n\n\n=== Awards ===\nMiller won the Washington Center For The Performing Arts' Achievement in the Arts award in 2024.\nMiller also won three Best of Olympia awards in the annual readers' poll of Tacoma, Washington, alternative newspaper Weekly Volcano.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMiller is married and has two sons.\nMiller is an avid magnet fisherman, and was profiled about his hobby in the Seattle Times in 2023.\nMiller is heavily tattooed; his tattoos include two important personal milestones in his comedy career: the marquee of Olympia's Capitol Theater, and a picture of a vomiting man under the word \"Vomity,\" celebrating the Olympia open mic he co-founded, Vomity.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nRound Trip (Stand Up!

Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch described the strikes as a war crime.\nSix unguided aerial bombs were filmed falling in a residential area in Chernihiv, in a triangular public square formed by Viacheslava Chornovila and Kruhova streets (51.5001°N 31.2791°E﻿ / 51.5001; 31.2791). Analysis by Amnesty International found that (at least) eight bombs fell. A witness living in Ivana Bohuna Street, Alina, heard a loud buzzing sound before the bombs exploded.\nUkrainian-born United States Congresswoman Victoria Spartz (IN-R) told reporters that her grandmother lived in a building nearby and the windows had all been destroyed.\nThe same day, two schools (No.18 and No.21) and 8 private houses were destroyed, and 7 more houses heavily damaged, in another place in Chernihiv, in the vicinity of Biloruskyi Lane.\n\n\n=== 16 March 2022 Chernihiv breadline attack ===\n\nOn 16 March 2022, a Russian attack killed at least 18 and injured 26 civilians in Chernihiv, Ukraine, who were waiting in a line for bread.\nThe event was reported as well as the United States Embassy in Kyiv. The attack, which he described as a bombing, was \"not the first such incoming shell, nor is it the first shelling of civilians by the enemy\". The US Embassy reported that the people had been \"shot and killed\". 18 people were reported dead by local authorities. The incident happened at around 10:00 UTC+3. Victims of the incident were killed following a blast shot from heavy artillery. These civilians were unarmed and some of them survived the shelling; they were taken to medical facilities by Chernihiv police.\n\n\n== 2023 ==\n\n\n=== August 2023 Chernihiv missile strike ===\n\nOn 19 August 2023, Russian military forces launched an Iskander-M ballistic missile at the Taras Shevchenko Theater in downtown Chernihiv, Ukraine.\nThe theater was hosting an exhibition on the use of consumer drones in the Russian Invasion of Ukraine, titled \"Lyuti Ptashky\" (Angry Birds), which was described by its organisers as \"a closed meeting of engineers, military and volunteers.\" Governor of Chernihiv Oblast, Vyacheslav Chaus, announced that 7 were dead, including a 6-year-old girl. Another 144 were injured, including 15 children and 15 policemen, with 41 injuries being grievous and requiring medical evacuations to a hospital.\n\n\n== 2024 ==\n\n\n=== April 2024 Chernihiv missile strike ===\n\nOn 17 April 2024, at around 9:00 am local time, the Russian military forces launched a missile strike against an eight-storey residential building in Chernihiv, Ukraine. Besides the direct hit against said residential building, another four high-rise buildings, a hospital, dozens of cars and a higher education institution were damaged. The attack killed 18 people, while 78 were injured. The attack came after a Ukrainian strike on a Russian military airfield in occupied Crimea. President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy once again appealed to the West to provide Ukraine with air defence equipment, claiming the attack happened because Ukrainian Army was running out of defence missiles.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Adelaide De Claire Thayer (1864–1945) was an American schoolteacher and writer. Born into extreme poverty in Michigan, she and her younger sister Voltairine developed a love of reading and writing at an early age. After Adelaide fell ill, Voltairine was sent away to be educated in a convent, but the two kept in touch through letters. They continued to exchange correspondence with each other into adulthood, with Voltairine telling Adelaide of her work as a tutor and public speaker, as well as her romantic partners, although the two disagreed on politics and rarely spoke on the matter. Although Adelaide herself had wanted to become a journalist, her mother pressured her into work as a schoolteacher. She later converted to Baptist denomination and married two working class men, which her mother disliked. After Voltairine's death, Adelaide became a key primary source in her life and collector of her works, supplying Joseph Ishill and Agnes Inglis with many letters, which are today in the respective collections of Harvard University and the University of Michigan.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nAdelaide De Claire was born in Leslie, Michigan, on March 10, 1864. She was the second daughter of Hector, a French tailor and socialist, and Harriet De Claire, who came from a New Englander family involved with the abolitionist movement.\nIn May 1867, Adelaide's older sister Marion was found dead, having accidentally drowned in a river. She later attributed the incident to \"many of the psychological mishaps that came to our family.\" The family moved to St. Johns, where Adelaide would live for the rest of her life. The family lived in extreme poverty, with the parents both working to provide their children with meager food, clothing and education. Adelaide recalled her and her younger sister Voltairine, unable to buy Christmas presents, would make their parents gifts out of scraps each year. With each passing year, Adelaide's father became increasingly bitter and her mother began to withdraw her affection from her daughters. Adelaide later wrote that her parents' lives had likely been a \"disappointment\" to them both.\n\n\n=== Growing up ===\nGrowing up, Adelaide and Voltairine were passionate readers of British literature, including poems and novels by Wilkie Collins, Charles Dickens and Walter Scott. To Adelaide, literature was one of the few comforts she had, remarking that one of her fondest memories of her childhood was when her mother read her poems by Lord Byron while putting her to sleep each night. Her sister was particularly taken with poetry and began writing her poems at an early age, some of which Adelaide found in her attic many decades later. She sent one of Voltairine's childhood poems to Agnes Inglis, saying: \"I want you to see it as I do—the spontaneous out-pouring of her practical nature and reaching for the beauty of expression. I cried as I read it, and am crying now as I write, to think of all the wasted years of misunderstanding, when we were children, when our childish years should have been filled with beauty, as they could have been.\"\nDuring the 1870s, Adelaide's father left their home to seek work in Port Huron, never returning to St. Johns, but sending the family money when he could. Adelaide recalls feeling that she and her sister \"suffered much shame and sorrow in that we were children of separated parents. All the bitter pain of it was ours.\" In early 1879, Adelaide became very ill, forcing her mother to focus most of her attention on caring for her. Voltairine was sent away to live with her father, who later sent her to be educated at a convent. Adelaide's letters to Voltairine were sometimes withheld by the convent's nuns, who surveilled all correspondence. Adelaide observed that the \"horrible, accursed convent\" turned Voltairine into a \"nervous wreck\", recalling that her rebellious sister was \"unmercifully punished\" with such punishments as enforced social isolation. In the letters she could send back home, Voltairine sent her love to Adelaide and wrote to her about the beauty of the natural landscape that surrounded the convent.\nWhen Adelaide grew up, her mother pressured her to become a schoolteacher, despite her own wishes to have worked as a journalist for a newspaper. She later upset her mother when she converted to a Baptist denomination and when she chose to marry, but Adelaide asserted that she had been \"glad to be one of the 'common people' myself. Mother could never see any use, or beauty in service of this kind. She never forgave me for marrying two poor men. But they were real men, and I was always proud that they selected me from the world of women.\" Despite this, she continued to defend her mother's behavior into old age, telling the Labadie Collection's curator Agnes Inglis: \"Don’t judge her too harshly, for she was the youngest of eight children and so she naturally grew up very self-centered.\"\n\n\n=== Correspondence with Voltairine ===\nAdelaide continued to correspond with her sister into their adulthood, with Voltairine keeping her updated on her work as a tutor, as well as her public speeches and recitations. On one occasion, after a speech she gave, Voltairine remarked to Adelaide that an old man had made her promise to deliver a eulogy at his funeral. When Voltairine came back to St. Johns to visit Adelaide and her mother, they avoided discussing Voltairine's new-found radical politics and non-traditional lifestyle: \"Her opinions and mine were very much out-of-step, so we said little about them to each other.\" Nevertheless, Voltairine continued to write to Adelaide about her travels as a freethinking speaker, writing from Pittsburgh that: \"I do see a lot of misery, misery enough to make one’s blood stand still in the veins. But there are many beautiful things too—many wonderful sweet things in this world.\" After receiving news of the Haymarket affair, Voltairine remarked to Adelaide that the perpetrators of the bombing \"ought to be hanged\", an exclamation she immediately regretted, especially after Adelaide responded in agreement: \"Voltai didn’t like it; she didn’t like the way my words rang in her ears.\" Voltairine later came to support the Haymarket defendants, whom she thought were falsely accused.\n\nAdelaide interrupted her sister's busy work schedule in the summer of 1898, with a five-week visit to Philadelphia, during which she took photographs of her sister reading and petting stray cats. During the visit, she met many Voltairine's friends, taking a particular liking to Mary Hansen and Nathan Navro, the latter of whom she described as a \"fine man and a good friend.\" Inspired by her connections with the Jewish anarchist movement, around this time, Voltairine began writing to Adelaide in the affectionate Yiddish manner: \"Sisterle\". When her mother visited the following year, she expressed worry to Adelaide that Voltairine was spending all her money on others and neglecting herself, saying that the dress Adelaide had given her \"was almost the only decent thing she had to wear\". When Voltairine stayed at a farm outside Philadelphia in the summer of 1900, she wrote extensively to Adelaide of how much she loved being so close to nature. Voltairine disliked living in cities, once informing Adelaide that she had missed a passing comet that she could not see because of the city's light pollution.\nDuring the 1890s, Adelaide received frequent letters about Voltairine's personal relationships. When Voltairine was rejected by T. Hamilton Garside, who she was infatuated with, she was overcome with anguish. Adelaide recalled her \"wringing her hands and pacing up and down in the garden, her long, long hair streaming down to her feet behind her as she paced in the garden.\" When Voltairine later had a son, Harry, Adelaide took pity on him, noting that he had inherited a depression from his mother. As Adelaide was childless, she asked Voltairine if she could take care of raising him; Voltairine responded that she didn't care what was done with the child, but Harry's father Elliott refused to give up custody. When one of Voltairine's subsequent partners, Nahum Berman, succombed to mental illness after their separation and died, Voltairine wrote to Adelaide that \"He was one of those strange characters who love life intensely, yet who can never adapt themselves to the condition of it. He was a born savage, a wild man, in his love of nature—and life, life, in every manifestation of it.\" After she separated with another of her partners, Samuel M. Gordon, in 1900, she wrote to Adelaide that although the two remained friends, \"he isn’t satisfied with me because I won’t agree to the regular program of married life (I don’t mean the ceremony but the rest of it—exclusive possession, home, children, all that) so we don’t see each other very often. I'm sorry, but I'll have to stand it. I’ve done the worst of my worrying over it, and have settled down to facts.\"\nBy the turn of the century, Adelaide had married Franklin Berry. In the wake of the assassination of Umberto I of Italy by Gaetano Bresci, Voltairine asked her \"How would your new husband stand an anarchist in his house?\" Voltairine herself spoke in defense of Bresci, sympathising with his motives, so wondered whether Adelaide's family \"mightn’t like me around.\" Voltairine had also expressed to Adelaide her fierce criticism of William McKinley's administration, in the year before the President's own assassination. In any case, Franklin Berry died in 1902. Within a few years, Adelaide had remarried, finding a second husband in Judd Thayer.\nWhen Adelaide's father died in 1906, she hadn't seen him in over two decades, but still expressed her grief for the \"poor old man\". In July 1909, Voltairine wrote to Adelaide that she was going to be visiting St. Johns, but that her mother \"should not expect much help around the house\", as she hated cooking. Signing off the letter, Voltairine sent her kind regards to Adelaide's husband, saying \"I hope he doesn't suppose me to be a dangerous explosive!\" By 1911, when Voltairine was earning enough to send her mother money, she complained to Adelaide that her mother had called it \"impractical\", saying \"mother loves us as much as it is in her broken-down, aged, infirm, and Puritan-poisoned soul to do.\"\n\n\n=== Later life and death ===\nWhen Voltairine died in June 1912, Adelaide and her mother travelled from St. Johns to Chicago in order to attend her funeral. Adelaide recalled one moment when: \"as my sister lay in her casket, Mrs. Lucy Parsons stood beside her and arranged a spray of red carnations on it; and a hush fell on the crowd.\" Adelaide's second husband, Judd Thayer, died in 1918.\nThroughout the 1930s, Adelaide wrote several letters about her sister to the anarchist publisher Joseph Ishill and the curator Agnes Inglis, which were respectively collected in Harvard University's Ishill Collection and the University of Michigan's Labadie Collection. In one 1934 letter to Inglis, she said of her family: \"Our mother was a remarkable woman. Father was a brilliant man. It is no wonder Voltai was a genius.\" She also regretted that nobody in her family had recognised neither Voltairine's \"beautiful spirit nor soul.\" During this time, Ishill put her in touch with Emma Goldman, who was writing a biography about Voltairine but had no awareness of Adelaide's existence.\nAdelaide De Claire Thayer died in St. Johns in 1945, at the age of eighty-one.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==",

        "content": "The Balalae Island mass graves was a war crime committed by the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II against British prisoners of war. The mass graves were discovered by Australian investigators after the end of the war.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn October 1942, 600 British prisoners of war who were taken prisoner after the fall of Singapore, along with their commander Lieutenant Colonel John Bassett, were loaded onto a ship and were told that they were being transported to a prison camp in Japan. They arrived on Balalae Island in late November 1942.\n\n\n== Forced Labour ==\nThe prisoners were forced to build a runway for the Japanese that is still in use today. Approximately 100 of the prisoners died from overworking, exhaustion and tropical diseases, but a great number of prisoners were killed by an allied air raid on the island which killed 300. However, the Japanese used the prisoner's camp has a human shield against the air raids.\n\n\n== Massacre ==\nOn 30 June 1943, after completing the runway, the remaining prisoners were executed en masse and thrown into mass graves. Many of them were either bayoneted or decapitated. Amongst the prisoners killed was the English cricketer Norman Bowell.\n\n\n== Discovery of the mass graves ==\nThe mass graves were discovered after the war by Australian investigators in November 1945. They exhumed the remains of over 400 bodies from the mass graves. They also found two sets of broken rosary beads, both of which were missing their crucifixes. Japanese authorities denied the war crime and claimed that the prisoners were lost at sea when their transport was torpedoed.\n\n\n== References ==",

UNCOVER-z13 is within Abell 2744 supercluster in the constellation Sculptor.\n\n\n== Morphology ==\nUNCOVER-z13 is a Lyman-Break galaxy, and not much more is known about the exact shape of the galaxy.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nUNCOVER-z13 was first observed when large amounts of gravitational lensing from Abell 2744 made the galaxy visible. Abell 2744 is around 3.5 billion light-years away from the Milky Way. The gravity of Abell 2744 warps the  fabric of space-time sufficiently to magnify the light of more faraway galaxies. The James Webb Space Telescope used the gravitational lensing to discover UNCOVER-z13.\n\n\n== UNCOVER-z12 ==\nUNCOVER-z12 is a second galaxy which was discovered around the same time. UNCOVER-z12 has a redshift of 12.393, making it the fourth-most distant object ever observed. It is a Lyman-Break galaxy, and was discovered using the same methods as UNCOVER-z13.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of the most distant astronomical objects\nJADES-GS-z13-0, furthest galaxy ever recorded\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nUNCOVER-z13 at the JWST Feed\nUNCOVER-z13 at IOPScience.org",

Built around 1850, the house had several owners before being purchased by attorney and later probate judge L. M. Lane.  Lane owned the house until 1921, when it was passed to his daughter, Katie Kendrick, and later to her daughter, Mrs. Dan Sherling.  The house is a single story, U-shaped Greek Revival building, with a hipped roof topped by a platform.  The five-bay façade has pairs of nine-over-nine sash windows flanking a double entrance door with sidelights and a transom.  While the interior plan and floors are original, most of the detailing was added in the 1950s, salvaged from Victorian houses in Montgomery, Mobile, and Birmingham.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.\n\n\n== References ==",

She was stricken in 1920.\n\n\n== Construction and commissioning ==\nOstro was laid down at the Schichau-Werke in Elbing in the German Empire on 23 March 1900. She was launched on 9 February 1901 and completed on 8 December 1901. She was commissioned in December 1901.\n\n\n== Service history ==\n\n\n=== Italo-Turkish War ===\nOstro played an active role in the Italo-Turkish War, which began on 29 September 1911 with the Kingdom of Italy′s declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire. At 05:00 on 18 April 1912 Ostro and the battleship Emanuele Filiberto arrived at Vathy on the island of Samos in the eastern Aegean Sea and without warning attacked the Ottoman military installations there, destroying a barracks that housed 1,200 men and some artillery batteries and forcing the garrison to surrender. The Italians claimed that Ostro torpedoed and sank an Ottoman Navy gunboat, identified as Ircanich or Ixanié by various sources, although the Ottomans claimed that the gunboat's crew scuttled her. The Italian ships departed immediately after the gunboat sank.\nOn 2 May 1912, Ostro and the battleship Regina Margherita conducted a diversionary action which included various attacks along the coast of Rhodes to distract the Ottoman garrison there while the Italians prepared an amphibious landing at Calitea. On either 7 or 28 May 1912, according to different sources, Ostro captured the former Ottoman governor Wali) of Rhodes — who also was the Ottoman governor of the Dodecanese — in the harbor at Lindos, which the Italians had occupied two days earlier, just as he was about to depart Lindos. The war ended on 18 October 1912 in an Italian victory.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nWorld War I broke out in 1914, and the Kingdom of Italy entered the war on the side of the Allies with its declaration of war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915. At the time, Ostro, under the command of Capitano di corvetta (Corvette Captain) Castiglioni, and the destroyers Dardo, Euro,  Lampo, and Strale made up the 4th Destroyer Squadron, based in Tripoli in Italian Tripolitania under the overall command of Capitano di fregata (Frigate Captain) F. Gambardella. By 1915, the Lampo-class destroyers were of antiquated design and had only limited military usefulness, but during World War I they were modified, having equipment installed to carry and lay 12 mines, drop depth charges, and tow explosive paravanes.\nThe presence of Ostro and Euro in the harbor at Durrës (known to the Italians as Durazzo) on the coast of the Principality of Albania in late December 1916 prompted the Austro-Hungarian Navy to raid the harbor on 29 December 1916 in an attempt to attack them during the Adriatic campaign. The two destroyers had left by the time the Austro-Hungarian raid took place and thus escaped damage, although the Austro-Hungarians sank the only ships that were present in the harbor, the Greek steamship Mikael and two sailing ships.\nBy late October 1918, Austria-Hungary had effectively disintegrated, and the Armistice of Villa Giusti, signed on 3 November 1918, went into effect on 4 November 1918 and brought hostilities between Austria-Hungary and the Allies to an end. World War I ended a week later with an armistice between the Allies and the German Empire on 11 November 1918.\n\n\n=== Post-World War I ===\nStricken from the naval register in September 1920, Ostro was discarded on 30 September 1920. She subsequently was scrapped.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nFavre, Franco. La Marina nella Grande Guerra.

        "content": "The cinema of Mozambique (Portuguese: Cinema de Moçambique) refers to the films and the film industry of Mozambique, which creates films in Portuguese (see List of Mozambican films). Furthermore, some foreign films have been produced about Mozambique or were shot there, such as Sidney Pollack's 2005 The Interpreter, Edward Zwick's 2006 Blood Diamond, and Teresa Prata's 2007 Sleepwalking Land (Terra Sonambula), an adaptation of the novel by Mozambican author Mia Couto.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter the independence of Mozambique on June 25, 1975, the new marxist regime of the FRELIMO party invested in cinematic film production to show its own vision. It invited established European film directors like French Jean Godard (1930–2022) and Jean Rouch (1917–2022) to work on film and video projects in Mozambique in the years 1977-1998: Godard to research video for television and Rouch for a Super 8 film project teaching at the Communications Department of Eduardo Mondlane University, while the Portuguese-Brazilian film director Ruy Guerra (born in Maputo, 1931) worked at the Maputo Instituto Nacional de Cinema (INC) founded by FRELIMO in 1976.\nFor instance Brazilian-Mozambican director Licínio Azevedo worked with Godard and Guerra in Maputo, or at least felt the influence of Godard and Rouch. In 2003 the Portuguese film maker Margarida Cardoso directed the documentary Kuxa Kanema: The Birth of Cinema detailing the founding of the National Institute of Cinema.\n\n\n== Mozambican film directors ==\nWell-known Mozambican film directors include Fátima Albuquerque, Licínio Azevedo,  José Cardoso (born 1939), Chico Carneiro, Sol de Carvalho (born 1953 in Beira, Mozambique), Yara Costa, Mickey Fonseca, Victor Lopes, Rogério Manjate, Orlando Mesquita Lima (born 1962 in Nampula), Isabel Noronha, Pedro Pimenta (born 1955), Camilo de Sousa, and Lara Sousa. British film maker Karen Boswall worked in Mozambique between 1993 and 2007.\n\n\n== Popular Mozambican films ==\nThe Internet Movie Database in 2016 provided a list of most popular Mozambican films, including:\n\n\n== Literature ==\nConvents, Guido (2009).

        "content": "Counterexamples in Probability and Statistics is a mathematics book by Joseph P. Romano and Andrew F. Siegel. It began as Romano's senior thesis at Princeton University under Siegel's supervision, and was intended for use as a supplemental work to augment standard textbooks on statistics and probability theory.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nR. D. Lee gave the book a strong recommendation despite certain reservations, particularly that the organization of the book was intimidating to a large fraction of its potential audience: \"There are plenty of good teachers of A-level statistics who know little or nothing about σ-fields or Borel subsets, the subjects of the first 3 or 4 pages.\" Reviewing new books for Mathematics Magazine, Paul J. Campbell called Romano and Siegel's work \"long overdue\" and quipped, \"it's too bad we can't count on more senior professionals to compile such useful handbooks.\"\nEric R. Ziegel's review in Technometrics was unenthusiastic, saying that the book was \"only for mathematical statisticians\" rather than \"pactitioners in the physical, chemical, and engineering sciences.\" Similarly, Rollin Brant found the book to have few data-based examples and suggested that a better title would have been Counterexamples in Probability and Theoretical Statistics. With that proviso, he deemed the book \"useful and entertaining\" and suggested that researchers as well as students \"will find this book a valuable resource.\"\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nRomano, J. P.; Siegel, A. F. (1986). Counterexamples in Probability and Statistics. Wadsworth & Brooks/Cole Advanced Books and Software. ISBN 0-534-05568-0.

        "content": "Memoir of a Russian Punk (Russian: Подросток Савенко, lit. 'Adolescent Savenko') is a 1983 autobiographical novel by the Russian writer Eduard Limonov.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nInterweaved with flashbacks, the story takes place in Kharkov in 1958, during the 41st anniversary of the October Revolution. Eddie is a 15-year-old boy who comes of age as he writes poetry and tries to rebel against a society he thinks is amoral. He is friends with a group of like-minded youths who occupy themselves by drinking, stealing and raping. Eddie loses his virginity, wins a poetry contest and participates in a robbery that goes wrong. His poetry saves him from a criminal career. Eventually, his friends end up in prison and one of them is executed, but Eddie moves to Europe.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nKirkus Reviews wrote that the book \"tries hard to shock but ends up being the story of your basic bright, sensitive boy who isn't quite cut out to be a monster of depravity, though he does try\". Publishers Weekly wrote that \"Limonov expertly captures the horrifying boredom of working-class Soviet urban life, and uses just the right hip, offhand tone to describe Eddie's adventures in the demi-world of teenage gangs and small-time hoods\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Karl Eduard Linsenmair (born 8 February 1940) is a German biologist and  university professor emeritus. His areas of work are general ecology, ethoecology, ecophysiology, sociobiology and orientation physiology; his focus is tropical ecology.\n\n\n== Life ==\nLinsenmair was born in Munich. He studied zoology, botany, chemistry, anthropology and psychology in Heidelberg, Freiburg and Frankfurt. He received his dissertation in 1966 German: Konstruktion und Signalfunktion der Sandpyramide der Reiterkrabbe Ocypode saratan Forsk. (Decapoda Brachyura Ocypodidae)(Construction and signaling function of the sand pyramid of the rider crab Ocypode saratan Forsk). (Decapoda Brachyura Ocypodidae)) received his doctorate. At the Goethe University Frankfurt in Frankfurt am Main he was a DFG research fellow from 1967 to 1970 and a research assistant in the biology department at the University of Regensburg in 1970/1971 . He completed his habilitation in 1971 and taught at the University of Regensburg from 1972 to 1976. In 1976 he took over the chair of animal ecology at the Zoological Institute of the University of Würzburg.\nLinsenmair has made a decisive contribution to the establishment and promotion of the research areas of tropical ecology and biodiversity. He initiated and coordinated the German Research Foundation (DFG) priority program “Mechanisms for the Conservation of Tropical Diversity” and the European Science Foundation program \"Tropical Canopy Research\", which has since been expanded to a global level. As the only biologist in the National Committee for Global Change Research, he was significantly involved in the development of the concept for the BMBF program BIOLOG-BIOTA. In this context, he led the BIOTA-West program, which aimed to use findings from basic ecological research to find concrete solutions to problems on the African continent.  He and his chair were responsible for the scientific and administrative coordination of 16 universities and scientific institutes in Germany, Burkina Faso, Benin and Ivory Coast.\n\n\n== Research in Africa ==\nIn the 1980s, Linsenmair developed plans to build a permanent ecological research station in the savannah of the Ivory Coast. On a research trip there in 1973, he was fascinated by the incredible diversity of the different frogs. The Comoé National Park has been a world heritage site since 1983. In 1989 the first huts were built from bushes and leaves, eaten by termites within a year and rebuilt. As early as 1991, Linsenmair received funding from the Thyssen Foundation for his ecological research station. Due to bureaucratic hurdles imposed by offices, authorities and ministries, collecting all the signatures from the 20 bodies took nine years; construction work on the research station did not begin until 1999.\nIn 2002, Linsenmair's research group moved to the massive camp, which was well equipped for zoological, botanical and ecological research. This was unique in West Africa. Linsenmair made important contributions to biodiversity research in West Africa. In addition to the occurrence and behavior of individual animal species, he examined global change, the spread of deserts and the loss of biodiversity. In September 2002, an international delegation visited the research station. Just a few weeks later, the First Ivorian Civil War began in Ivory Coast, which raged directly at Linsenmair's station. He and his European colleagues were flown out and were only able to return ten years later. During this time, Linsenmair led the Biota West Africa project from Benin and Burkina Faso. The project conducted biodiversity research and built an international network.\nIn 2010, after almost two years of planning and construction, the new information center on biodiversity was opened by Karl Eduard Linsenmair and Robert Foro in Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso, in which the collected knowledge will now be made available to the general public.  The civil war officially ended in 2007, but it was only in 2011 that the government became somewhat stable and was able to contain the unrest that was flaring up. In 2012, Linsenmair returned to the savannah after the civil war and found the research station in ruins. He and his colleagues rebuilt everything. Today there are 14 guest houses with air conditioning and running water at a distance around the main building. The centerpiece is a long research building with a library, offices and laboratories. The station has had an internet connection since 2014 and research operations have started again. Several students and doctoral candidates are researching various projects here and have already published their first scientific publications.\n\n\n== Memberships and honors ==\nKarl Eduard Linsenmair became president of the Gesellschaft für Tropenökologie (Society for Tropical Ecology) (gtö) in 1990, and has been an elected member of the German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina since 1997 and of the Academia Europaea since 1998.  He is also president of the Society for Tropical Ecology (gtö). He is chairman of the scientific advisory board and member of the board of trustees of the ZMT (Leibniz Centre for Tropical Marine Research) in Bremen as well as a member of the scientific advisory board and the board of trustees of the German arm of World Wide Fund for Nature. He is also a member of various advisory boards and committees (“Global Change Research”, Senckenberg Research Institute, Natural History Museum, Berlin, DFG Zoology Review Board for the subject “Ecology and Ecosystem Research”). \nIn 1996 Linsenmair received the Körber Prize for European Science.   In 2014, Linsenmair was awarded the Gold Medal of Merit from the University of Würzburg for his contributions to research. \n\n\n== Publications ==\nLinsenmair, K.

        "content": "The Doors of the Roman Pantheon are the main entrance bronze doors to the rotunda of the Roman Pantheon.\nAs a monument of applied arts, the exact date of their creation has remained open to speculation for centuries, with scholars attempting to determine the age of the doors and whether they are contemporaneous with the Pantheon.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe doors, measuring 4.45 meters wide and 7.53 meters high, consist of two leaves. The panels and lintels of the doors are made of cast bronze. Each leaf pivots on pins installed in the floor at the bottom and in the architrave at the top. The doors, in form and detail, resemble the ancient bronze doors of Rome, such as those in the Temple of Romulus and the Curia Julia.\nBronze pilasters with fluting, surmounted by Tuscan capitals, flank both sides of the doors. These capitals are adorned with egg-and-dart motifs of the Ionic order—bronze casting in the form of egg-shaped ornaments and arrowheads. The pilasters are connected by an entablature composed of a concise frieze. Above the doors, on a wooden frame, sits a transom—six identical rectangular vertical bronze lattice panels with a simple and fairly common ancient pattern. This structure is part of the building's ventilation system, allowing air to flow inside even when the doors are closed.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIt is uncertain whether these doors are contemporaneous with the Pantheon, with opinions both for and against. Some researchers of the Pantheon believed these doors to be genuinely ancient, not stolen by conquerors, Eastern Emperors (with Constans II exporting bronze), or medieval Popes. Johann Joachim Winckelmann was also confident in the ancient age of the doors, as he stated in his work Storia dell’arte nell’antichità. Doubts have been expressed about the ancient age of the doors, with the noted disproportion of the doors to comply with the prescriptions of Vitruvius suggesting their manufacture in the Modern Age. There have been suggestions that the original doors were looted during the Sack of Rome by King Gaiseric of the Vandals in the 5th century, as the Vandals' booty included copper stripped from the roof of the Temple of Jupiter, as mentioned by Procopius of Caesarea.\nThere is also a version suggesting that the doors only partially contain ancient elements, with some elements unquestionably more recent. There is evidence that during restoration work on the Pantheon in 1759, the doors were repaired because they were damaged due to a fall during an attempt to remove them two years earlier, resulting in the death of the unfortunate master mason Corsini.\nResearchers doubt that the wooden beam frame, to which the bronze parts of the doors are attached, could be of ancient age and lean towards the belief that the doors underwent substantial reconstruction in the Middle Ages or during the time of Pope Urban VIII.\nFor 241 years, the right door remained completely blocked, and the left one opened only partially. In 1998, after careful examination, the doors were slightly raised using specially made plates coated with a layer of soap. The pins were replaced, and the doors became fully functional.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nDonaldson, Thomas (1833).

        "content": "Gherardo Gambelli (born 23 June 1969) is a Roman Catholic priest for the Archdiocese of Florence.  He was appointed as Archbishop of Florence on 18 April 2024.  He devoted more than a decade of his time as a priest to missionary work in Chad.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nGambelli was born in Viareggio on 23 June 1969 and raised in Castelfiorentino.  He studied at the major seminary in Florence and on 2 June 1996, he was ordained to the Catholic priesthood for the Archdiocese of Florence by Cardinal Silvano Piovanelli, the archbishop of Florence at the time.\n\n\n== Presbyteral ministry ==\nGambelli's first pastoral assignment was as parish vicar of the Chiesa di Santo Stefano in Pane in the district of Rifredi.  After four years as an assistant priest, he undertook studies at the Pontifical Gregorian University, graduating with a licentiate in biblical theology in 2000.  He then served as the administrator of the Pieve di Sant'Andrea in Cercina until 2006, while also teaching as a visiting professor at the Major Seminary of N'Djamena in Chad from 2001 to 2006.\nAfter being awarded a doctorate from the Theological Faculty of Central Italy in 2007, Gambelli became a full-fledged pastor of Immacolata e San Martino in Montughi.  He served in that capacity for four years before being sent as a missionary priest to the Archdiocese of N'Djaména in Chad in 2011.  There, he served as parish priest of Sainte Joséphine Bakhita, was in charge of vocational pastoral care, and taught at the national minor seminary.  Gambelli became rector of the Cathédrale Saint-Ignace in the neighbouring Apostolic Vicariate of Mongo in 2018, before being appointed vicar general of the vicariate following year.  His years in Chad included two stints as a prison chaplain, from 2011 to 2017 at N'Djaména prison and from 2018 to 2022 at the prison in the Mongo Vicariate.\nUpon his return to Italy in 2023 at the request of his ordinary, Giuseppe Betori, Archbishop of Florence, Gambelli became pastor of Madonna della Tosse.  He was also assistant spiritual director of the seminary and a prison chaplain.\n\n\n== Episcopal ministry ==\nGambelli was appointed Archbishop of Florence on 18 April 2024.  His appointment was described by Il Messaggero as part of a pattern in which Pope Francis chooses dark horse candidates with experience in parish and missionary work for important sees.  Avvenire referred to him as \"the priest of the peripheries, from Africa to prison\". Gambelli's episcopal consecration and installation are scheduled for 24 June.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Female genital mutilation in the Gambia is the practice of removing all or part of the female's genitalia for cultural reasons, believed by those who practice it to affect sexual purity and obedience and required before marriage in some communities. The Gambia is one of 28 countries in Africa where female genital mutilation (FGM) is known to be practiced.\n\n\n== Prevalence ==\nBeginning in 2010, household surveys asked women about the FGM status of all their living daughters. Out of all countries where surveys were conducted, the highest prevalence of female genital mutilation among girls aged 0–14 was in the Gambia. (56 percent) According to a 2022 UNICEF report, 75 percent of Gambian girls aged 15–19 had been subjected to the practice.\n\n\n== Activism ==\nThe Gambia Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children and Safe Hands for Girls, a local group, campaign to end the practice. Human rights experts and lawyers commented on the plans to revoke the 2015 bill, saying it would undo decades of work to end the practice. The UN urged the Gambia not to decriminalise the practice.\nThe United States of America is supportive of activists who seek to end the practice. In 2024, Fatou Baldeh was awarded an International Women of Courage Award at the White House.\n\n\n== Legality ==\nIn 2015, the Gambia banned female genital mutilation. As of 2024, someone who is convicted of performing the practice could be given a fine of 50,000 dalasi (about 622 GBP or US$735) and/or up to three years in prison. Enforcement of the law has been limited with only two cases being prosecuted from its inception to 2024.\nIn 2023, the conviction of three women for mutilating eight infants led to debates in the country about the ban. Abdoulie Fatty, an influential Imam, paid the fines to release the convicted women from prison and started campaigning to lift the ban on female genital mutilation.\nMembers of the National Assembly of the Gambia backed a proposal to repeal the law. At the same time, the Gambia Supreme Islamic Council published a fatwa that requested the government to reconsider the 2015 ban while condemning anyone who criticizes female genital mutilation.\nIn 2024, 42 out of 47 members of the Gambia National Assembly voted in favor of sending a bill to a committee for review. This bill would overturn the 2015 ban.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Politisches derby (lit. Political derby) is an association football rivrly between German clubs FC Hansa Rostock and FC St. Pauli. The derby was first contested on 12 August 1992. Hansa Rostock play at the Ostseestadion in Rostock, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, while St. Pauli play at the Millerntor-Stadion in St. Pauli, Hamburg. The teams has played 23 matches, Hansa Rostock winning 12 and St. Pauli winning 11. \n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe origin of the name Politisches derby is due to leftist alignment of St. Pauli and rightist alignment of Hansa Rostock. In 1980s, St. Pauli transitioned from standard traditional club into Kult club, officially banning right-wing nationalist activities and displays in its stadium during a period of fascist-inspired football hooliganism across Europe., while Hansa Rostock leans towards far-right ideology and Neo-Nazism.\nThe first derby was played on 12 August 1992, Hansa Rostock won 2–0 away at St. Pauli. Both clubs have contested majority of the derby in 2. Bundesliga. The first top-flight derby was contested on 23 September 1995 during 1995–96 Bundesliga season. \n\n\n== Supporters ==\n\n\n=== Fans and violence ===\nThe violence clashes between both sets of fans are a common occurrence due to their political ideologies as Hansa Rostock promotes Neo-Nazism, while St. Pauli fans are Anti-fascist, making it one the football match with high police security.  During a clash between the clubs, Hansa Rostock fans wore black hoods with number 88 on it. After a late St. Pauli goal, Hansa Rostock fans peppered celebrating St. Pauli at away end with fireworks and flares, while bananas were thrown at St. Pauli's black goalkeeper. \nDuring a match away to Rostock, St. Pauli unveiled a 20 meter long banner at away end with a message, \"St. Pauli Antifa – Red or Dead\" and were barraged with missiles.\nAfter a match in 2011, Rostock coach Peter Vollmann said, \"You could hand out a €10 million fine, it changes nothing. It is hopeless.\" after Hansa's fascist chants.  During the match bananas were thrown at St. Pauli goalkeeper, Philipp Tschauner and a Rostock fan hung up a St. Pauli shirt doused in petrol and set it alight.\nDuring 2009–10 season, St. Pauli supported fans of Hansa Rostock after St. Pauli reduced away fans seats from 1,900 to 500, also displaying a banner saying, \"Today Rostock, Tomorrow Us?\".\n\n\n== Matches ==\n\n\n=== All-time results ===\n\n\n=== Statistics ===\nAs of 25 November 2023\n\n\n== Statistics ==\n\n\n=== All-time top goalscorers ===\n\n\n=== All-time most appearances ===\n\n\n=== Discipline ===\nRed cards\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Where Blue Begins is an album by the American musician Deborah Coleman, released in 1998. Coleman supported the album with a North American tour, backed by her band, the Thrillseekers. Coleman was nominated for a W. C. Handy Award for best \"Blues Instrumentalist, Guitar\".\n\n\n== Production ==\nColeman wanted a smoother sound for the album, and chose to use Luther Allison's band rather than her touring band. She worked on her songs by driving around in her van and using a tape recorder to capture musical ideas. Coleman played a Fender Squier Telecaster. Most of the lyrics are drawn from Coleman's personal experience. \"They Raided the Joint\" is a version of the Louis Jordan song. \"Hain't It Funny\" is a cover of the song by Jane Siberry.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that Coleman \"has a soulful, expressive voice that complements a guitar style that moves fluidly from subtle to searing.\" The San Diego Union-Tribune said that \"she writes insightful songs with tales pulled from her own experience and delivers them with sass and emotional intensity.\" Jazziz noted that \"some solos, perhaps inspired by Jeff Beck, are fleet-fingered and linear, though Coleman more often repeats short cascades of notes.\" The Toronto Star concluded that, \"though her voice clearly has a way to go before it makes you misty-eyed, her axe work is nothing less than astonishing.\" The Washington Post opined that, \"when Coleman tries to blend blues and funk, as on the opening track 'Love Moves Me', she matches cliches from each camp rather than crafting something new.\"\nAllMusic labeled Coleman \"a female lead singer who's not imitating the bellowing 'blues mama' persona so familiar to the genre, and she's one hell of a lead guitar player.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Cidadão Brasileiro is a 213-chapter Brazilian telenovela produced and aired by Record between March 13 and November 20, 2006, which replaced the news slot and was replaced by Vidas Opostas. It was written by Lauro César Muniz with the collaboration of Rosane Lima and Dora Castellar, and directed by Flávio Colatrello Jr, Fábio Junqueira, João Camargo, Ivan Zettel and Henrique Martins. It was the 4th telenovela aired by Record since 2004. It is also responsible for inaugurating the second telenovela slot on the channel, airing simultaneously with Prova de Amor. After premiering at 8:30 pm, Cidadão Brasileiro was transferred to 10 pm in the third month.\nThe title of the telenovela is a reference to the protagonist Antônio Maciel, an \"ambiguous hero who oscillates between his professional dream and the temptation of easy money\", according to Muniz. Journalist Marcelo Marthe from Veja magazine identified the conflict between honesty and corruption in Antônio. Both the ambiguity of the characters and the absence of most of the typical clichés of the genre are the main characteristics of the plot, which had its script highly praised by the press.\nIt features Gabriel Braga Nunes, Lucélia Santos, Paloma Duarte, Carla Regina, Floriano Peixoto, Luíza Tomé, Tuca Andrada and Leonardo Brício in the lead roles.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAt Globo, Lauro César Muniz was responsible for very successful telenovelas, such as Escalada, Roda de Fogo and O Salvador da Pátria. However, after Zazá aired in 1997, only two of his works were produced: the miniseries Chiquinha Gonzaga and Aquarela do Brasil, in 1999 and 2000 respectively. Since then, every synopsis he presented to Globo's Teledramaturgy Department was rejected or shelved, as the company wanted to \"make soap operas along Mexican lines in order to export more\". Globo also tried to offer Muniz the production of A Imperatriz do Café, whose rights had been acquired by actress Regina Duarte. However, in April 2005, he was attracted by Record's proposal, which included greater freedom to produce his projects. When he was hired, he submitted three synopses: two contemporary plots and a reinterpretation of a previous production he had written.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\nWith Cidadão Brasileiro, Record inaugurated a second national telenovela slot, after Prova de Amor proved successful. Elements of three telenovelas written by Lauro César Muniz (Escalada, O Casarão and Quarenta Anos Depois) are represented in Cidadão Brasileiro. According to him, the aim is to \"rescue\" the ideals disseminated in the 1970s, when \"the truly Brazilian telenovela\" was implemented. Although they share similar themes, in Cidadão Brasileiro, Muniz sought to \"have the same concern for inserting the character into a political and social universe\". The protagonist's name is a combination of the characters Antônio Dias (Tarcísio Meira in Escalada) and João Maciel (Paulo Gracindo in O Casarão).\nMuniz's father's life served as the basis for the telenovela's plot, just as in Escalada. In the first phase, Antônio gets rich from cotton production and becomes the owner of the movie theater, until he loses everything, just as Muniz's father did.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nThe role of Fausta was initially offered to actress Sônia Braga, who showed interest in the character but did not reach an agreement with Record. Later, it was offered to Bruna Lombardi, whose hiring was described as \"practically a done deal.\" Hiring proposals, both for actors and members of the technical team, were kept secret to avoid inflating the market. The first actor to be officially announced as part of the cast was Gabriel Braga Nunes, in October 2005. By the end of the following month, Tuca Andrada, Paloma Duarte and Francisca Queiroz were hired. At the end of the year, Lucélia Santos was confirmed for the role of Fausta. The hiring of Floriano Peixoto, who would play Atílio, the main rival of the protagonist in the plot, was confirmed on January 8, 2006, a few days before filming began.\nHiring the technical team caused considerable difficulty for the production. Both Jayme Monjardim and Ignácio Coqueiro were invited to take over the direction of the telenovela, but Flávio Colatrello eventually won the role.\n\n\n=== Scenic city ===\nAt the time, Record already had RecNov, a studio for the production of telenovelas. However, the structure was not completely defined. In 2005, the site, which was only capable of filming one production, was already busy filming Prova de Amor, and the renovations would not be completed in time to start filming the new production, planned for October. Consequently, a 10,000-square-meter plot of land was rented to become a fictional construction site to portray the building of Brasília. The outdoor scenes were shot in a scenic city built in Bragança Paulista to represent a fictionalized version of the municipality of Guará, and the studio scenes at Record's headquarters in São Paulo.\n\n\n=== Recordings ===\nFilming began in January 2006. Two months into the telenovela, director Flávio Colatrello Jr. left Cidadão Brasileiro due to a conflict of ideas with the broadcaster and with Muniz, who said:\nCidadão Brasileiro has an exceptional cast. It deserves everyone's affection, from those who write and those who direct. Unfortunately, until recently, the number of chapters was small because of the March rains and excessive locations. There was an absurd loss of quality in the direction. I've reduced the number of locations and we've made more progress. Therefore, we expect a result more in line with the quality of our squad.\nBefore Colatrello's departure, conflicts were reported for different reasons, such as the lighting used, his behavior during filming and the method that would be used to age the characters during the second phase of the production. After his resignation, João Camargo was invited to join the directing team, and Fábio Junqueira and Ivan Zettel had their duties increased. Later, Camargo was reassigned to the production team of the telenovela Alta Estação and replaced by actor and director Henrique Martins.\nThe death of the character Eleni, played by Maytê Piragibe, was recorded to match the start of filming for the substitute telenovela, Vidas Opostas, in which she would play the protagonist. The last chapter of Cidadão Brasileiro aired on November 20, with the replacement premiering the following day. The telenovela was the last work of actor Jece Valadão, who died a few days after the end of the show.\n\n\n== Storyline ==\nCidadão Brasileiro tells the story of a man from his youth in the 1950s to his old age at the beginning of the 21st century. Born in 1928, the protagonist Antônio Maciel (Gabriel Braga Nunes) is a determined man on a difficult journey of social progress, with his professional achievements and failures and his conflicts in love, which involve three women of opposite temperaments and social levels. There are two phases: the first describes Antônio's professional beginnings in Guará and in the construction of Brasilia, covering the 1950s and 1960s, and the second addresses the period of the military dictatorship in the 1970s. In an epilogue, set in 2006, the elderly Antônio revisits his career.\n\n\n=== First phase: Rise ===\nThe plot begins when Antônio Maciel, an agricultural salesman, is robbed by Fausta (Lucélia Santos), a woman who seduces him and takes all the money he had received and was supposed to give to his boss. Unemployed and in debt, Antônio chases Fausta until he reaches the town of Guará, in the interior of São Paulo. She plans to run a scam on Atílio (Floriano Peixoto), the city's main landowner and political leader, posing as a representative of the federal government who will help him in his election campaign. Antônio, aware of Fausta's profiteering nature, takes revenge and uses her to achieve a rapid rise in the city. Soon he stands out, makes good relationships and meets two women: Carolina (Carla Regina), a simple farm girl, and Luíza (Paloma Duarte), a sophisticated and well-educated girl from São Paulo.\nIn Guará, Antônio also meets Homero (Tuca Andrada), a serious journalist, owner of the newspaper Voz da Liberdade and of firm progressive convictions, who, initially a member of the Communist Party, begins to confront the other party members because he disagrees with certain positions. Antônio and Atílio become rivals. Antônio focuses on cotton production in Guará and the investment proves successful. After becoming rich, he buys and refurbishes the city's cinema, where some of the greatest artists perform. Antônio is elected mayor, beating Atílio. However, the fall in cotton prices destabilizes Antônio financially. He loses everything and is forced to leave the city.\nMarried to Carolina, he leaves for São Paulo to restart. Luíza was unable to face the difficulties and left him to marry Camilo (Taumaturgo Ferreira), a stable businessman. In the mid-1950s, Brasilia begins to be built and Antônio goes to the Central Plateau to participate in the project, working for Edouard Girard (Gilbert Stein), owner of the construction company Obradec. Antônio becomes more distant from Carolina and, while their marriage fails, he achieves a more stable financial position.\n\n\n=== Second phase: 1968 onwards ===\nOnce Brasília is inaugurated, Antônio returns to São Paulo and meets Fausta, spouse of a millionaire on the verge of death. Fausta introduces him to Otávio (Luís Carlos Miéle) and Manuela Gama (Françoise Forton). After Otávio's death, Fausta convinces Manuela to hand over the management of the business to Antônio. He acquires the power, but loses his freedom as he becomes manipulated by Fausta. Years after their affair, Antônio decides to win Luiza back. Homero gets involved in politics again and runs for federal office. Marcelo (Bruno Ferrari) and Tereza's relationship ends after Eleni (Maytê Piragibe) dies. Tereza (Luiza Tomé) gets involved in the fight against the military dictatorship, becomes a militant and takes part in the Angolan War of Independence, fighting for the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola, where she dies. Marcelo, after the relationship ends, continues his career as a lawyer.\n\n\n=== Epilogue: 2006 ===\nIn the last chapter, Antônio, at the age of 80, lives in Guará with Luiza and reviews his life. He bought the construction company Obradec, became rich and bought the land where he lived in Guará: Fazenda do Casarão, which belonged to Luísa's family, and Fazenda das Águas, which belonged to Carolina's father. Luiza's daughter, Dóris (Thaís Sima), starts studying in São Paulo and gets closer to her mother. While Fausta ends up alone and bankrupt, Atílio, despite also facing financial problems, manages to resume his marriage after moving from Guará to São Paulo and selling his properties to Antônio.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n=== Special guests ===\n\n\n== Exhibition ==\nInitially scheduled to be shown at 10pm, Cidadão Brasileiro premiered at 8:30pm. During the second month, it was transferred to 10pm to escape the competition from Globo's soap operas and became established. The show was responsible for inaugurating Record's second telenovela slot.\n\n\n=== Reruns ===\nCidadão Brasileiro was rebroadcast for the first time from April 9, 2014, to January 27, 2015, in 213 chapters at 5:15 pm by RFTV, which belongs to Grupo Record, replacing Essas Mulheres. The same channel aired it for the second time from March 9, 2020, to January 8, 2021, in 220 chapters at 2 pm, replacing Marcas da Paixão. It aired for the third time from May 3, 2021, to March 4, 2022, in 211 chapters at 7:30 pm, replacing Vidas Cruzadas and being replaced by Os Dez Mandamentos.\n\n\n== Music ==\n\nThe CD with the telenovela soundtrack was released containing the following songs:\n\n\n== Release and repercussions ==\n\nAfter the first chapter of Cidadão Brasileiro was shown, Folha de S. Paulo analyzed the premiere: \"Something missing from 'Cidadão Brasileiro' is the ambition of the story and the very clear intention, through the protagonist Antônio, to provide an interpretation of the national issues of the last 50 years. The hero represents the subject in the struggle for social ascension in a country refractory to any construction project that lasts long enough to come to fruition. It all seems very interesting, but perhaps there is no longer a place in soap operas for a story that requires such dedication. Not because of the audience's bad attitude (or unwillingness), but because perhaps the model has simply run out of steam.\"\nAt the premiere, journalist Patrícia Kogut said that the production was \"a pleasant telenovela, without any sparkle\", compared to what had been produced. Judging the premiere as \"disappointing\", she said: \"It was similar to a lot of what we've seen on television, a soap opera that resembled old soap operas, without the brilliance of novelty or the step forward of overproduction. (...) Globo does much better, see the premiere of Sinhá Moça, yesterday too. You can't evaluate television by saying that a product is good based on the broadcaster that produces it. It would be more interesting if Record invested in creating its own language. It wouldn't fall into comparative competition, because it would be treading an authorial path. Gabriel Braga Nunes is a great actor, but he carried the chapter almost single-handedly.\"\nLeila Reis, from the newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo, evaluated the premiere positively and pointed out that it showed \"how big the gap is between Globo and the others\". Highlighting \"the women's heavy make-up\" and the poor \"quality of the image seen on the video\" as some of the production's negative aspects, she praised the quality of the soundtrack, the cast and the scenery: \"The outdoor locations are good, well cared for, and the composition of the period - sets and costumes - is well done\".\n\n\n=== Audience and sexualization of the characters ===\nIn the premiere, Cidadão Brasileiro scored 15 points in the Brazilian Institute of Public Opinion and Statistics (IBOPE) measurement, making it the second highest audience in the time slot during the period. It reached 23 points during parts of the broadcast. The chapters of the same week scored 13 points. Throughout the entire broadcast, the telenovela maintained an average of 12 points.\nIn March 2006, journalist Amelia Gonzalez pointed out that the performance of actress Carla Regina, who tried to \"force the image of a seductive and naive young woman\", was caricatured in some moments. The conversation between Celso and his family was seen as malicious and surprising by Istoé Gente magazine. Later, a dialog between Antônio and Luiza implied that he had a large penis. The conversation received considerable media attention. Muniz said: \"There's no double entendre, but I'm careful to avoid crude phrases. I often want to express myself about sex and delicate subjects for the time the soap opera airs\". The constant presence of eroticized dialogues was highlighted by reports in the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper and the Istoé Gente and Veja magazines.\nIn the first chapters, besides Luiza, Antônio became involved with Fausta and Carolina. The increasingly common presence of eroticized scenes attracted attention, especially since Record is a television station linked to the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God. According to Folha de S. Paulo, \"Luiza and Antônio are not even official boyfriend and girlfriend. And sex, in such a relationship, is forbidden by the evangelicals of the Universal Church (as it is by Catholics)\". It also differed from Prova de Amor, where there was no eroticism, with the lead couples simply kissing or embracing in romantic situations. Tiago Santiago, author of Prova de Amor, argued that his experience showed him \"what can and can't be shown in this time slot\", which is why he paid \"constant attention\" to what was shown, trying to produce a telenovela that the whole family could watch, while Muniz argued that he had complete freedom to write the plot, and that \"latent sensuality\" was \"a hallmark\" of his work.\n\n\n=== Themes addressed ===\nTaíssa Stivanin, from the newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo, commented that Cidadão Brasileiro \"showed that the investment made in the area of teledramaturgy [by Record] puts the broadcaster close to Globo's level\" and explained that \"it's still early to conclude about the soap opera's performance, but it premiered with stories and conflicts well tied up by author Lauro César Muniz. Synchronism is hard to see.\"\nMost of the praise went to the character Antônio. Stivanin described him as \"quite a character. In the style of Muniz, a protagonist-antagonist, who acts between right and wrong\". Journalist Laura Mattos described Antônio as a \"daring\" character, as he was \"far removed from the cliché of the good guy\". Bia Abramo pointed out that the story was very ambitious and said that \"the possibility of the soap opera offering an imaginary space for the construction of a national identity may have narrowed, become desolate and been transferred to paradidactic miniseries.\" Despite this caveat, Antônio's assessment was positive: \"The hero, ambiguous as is appropriate these days, is cut out to represent the subject in the struggle for social ascension in a country refractory to any construction project that lasts long enough to come to fruition.\"\nAfter the end of production, Dirceu Alves Jr., in a review published by Istoé Gente magazine, said that the production was \"ambitious\" and \"bold\" and that \"a great cast, a script full of intertextuality by the great Lauro César Muniz and Record's investment to establish itself in teledramaturgy conspired to make Cidadão Brasileiro an outstanding soap opera\". According to him, the episodes of the second phase presented a \"realistic approach to the dictatorship\", but no longer featured the protagonist involved in an exciting plot. Simone Mousse, from the newspaper O Globo, commented that \"Cidadão Brasileiro seeks to take stock of Brazil's history through its characters\". Marcelo Marthe, from Veja magazine, saw the characters as \"an allegory of national dilemmas\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Brazilian telenovelas\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCidadão Brasileiro at IMDb",

        "content": "St Mary's is a Church of Ireland church in Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe modern church was constructed in 1817 and funded through a loan from the Board of First Fruits. A new nave and chancel were built and incorporated the tower and belfry of a much older medieval church. It originally formed part of the manor of Newcastle Lyons and was a prebend of St Patrick's Cathedral.\nThe tower can be seen clearly in a 1795 illustration of the area by engraver Francis Jukes amongst a number of two storey houses in a mainly rural setting.\nThe circular enclosure area of the church would indicate that it was originally built in an ecclesiastical setting and possibly pre Norman.  The site would have originally included a moat.\nThe church is recorded during the royal visit of 1615 when William Cogan is noted as curate.\nThe church door features a broken pediment similar to older churches of the Georgian era in Dublin which was likely added around 1710.\nThe limestone rubble wall surrounding the grounds of the church was built in the 1720s and was restored in the 1820s following the completion of the new church. An Act of Parliament in 1818, the Kilmainham, St. James, Clondalkin, Crumlin, Newcastle, and Rathcoole (Dublin) Inclosure Act 1818 enclosed the grounds surrounding the church which previously acted as a form of local common.\nIn 1878, a stained glass window was erected in the church by Mayer & Co in honour of Sir Frederick Shaw, 3rd Baronet.\n\n\n=== Cemetery ===\nThe oldest of the headstones standing in the graveyard in modern times dates to 'Elenor Higgens' of 1622.\nIn John D'Alton's, The History of the County of Dublin (1838), he references tombstones at that time with the names of Deanes of Ravensthorpe, Northamptonshire and of Pinnock, in Gloucestershire. He also references one in 1699 to Eliza, daughter of Maurice Cuffe, of the county Clare and to the Purcells, from 1691.\nJoseph Deane later inherited most of the area surrounding the church on the death of his father Joseph Deane in 1699 and constructed the Georgian Crumlin House which still stands as of 2024 and now forms part of the Salesian provincial house.\n\n\n=== New church ===\nThe church was replaced by a nearby new church designed by McDonnell & Dixon in 1942.\nCanon Walter Burrows, who had been appointed in 1937, presided over the planning and construction of the new church and carried out its consecration in 1942.\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n1795 image of Crumlin\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Pterocarpus mildbraedii is a semi-deciduous tree within the family Fabaceae. It is known as 'Oha' in Southeastern Nigeria and as 'Aguaya' in Ivory Coast.\n\n\n== Description ==\nA perennial and semi-deciduous non climbing tree that can reach 25 m in height and has a small rounded crown. Its bark is smooth but sometimes longitudinally cracked and greyish to pale brown in color exuding a red latex. Leaves are alternate and imparipinnately compound, the younger leaves tend to be light green but upon maturity it becomes a darker shade of green. Leaflets are ovate to elliptical in shape, acuminate at the apex while rounded at the base, they can reach up to 14 cm long and 7 cm wide. The flowers are golden yellow and he fruit is a large obovate semi transparent pod that is up to 12 cm long.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nIt is distributed in West and Central Africa from Guinea to the Democratic Republic of Congo, and it is also found in the Usambara mountains of Tanzania.\n\n\n== Uses ==\nLeaves of the species are used as ingredients in the preparation of 'oha' soup in Nigeria. Leaf extracts are also used in traditional medicine for pain management. However, studies have shown the leaves to be high on hydrogen cyanide and oxalate. In Ghana, it is considered to be suitable as a shade tree in cocoa plantations.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Anna-Karin Heijdenberg (born 22 June 2000) is a Swedish biathlete. She made her debut in the Biathlon World Cup in 2024.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAnna-Karin Heijdenberg made her international debut in March 2019 in the IBU Junior Cup and also participated in the 2019 Junior European Championships in Sjusjøen. Three years later, she reappeared at the Junior World Championships in 2021 but did not feature prominently in the results. Her debut in the IBU Cup came at the beginning of 2022 in Osrblie, where she finished 66th in the sprint. At the end of the season, she once again participated in the Junior World Championships, finishing sixth with the relay team and 27th in the sprint and pursuit. After another winter without international race participation, Heijdenberg surprised everyone by finishing second behind Elvira Öberg at the preparation races in Idre in November 2023, thus qualifying for the IBU Cup team. She immediately impressed in the IBU Cup, for example, achieving second place in the mixed competition in Kontiolahti with Sara Andersson, Emil Nykvist, and Henning Sjökvist. Her first individual podium followed shortly after, as Heijdenberg secured third place in the sprint in Idre despite two shooting misses, thanks to a strong skiing performance.\nAt the end of the 2023/24 season she was called up to the main team for the World Cup in Oslo, where she immediately got into the points zone with a 25th place in the individual race. At the last World Cup stage in Canmore, she improved her best result with a 15th place in the sprint.\n\n\n== Biathlon results ==\nAll results are sourced from the International Biathlon Union.\n\n\n=== World Cup ===\n\n\n=== Youth and Junior World Championships ===\n0 medals\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAnna-Karin Heijdenberg at IBU",

        "content": "The Fool's Cap Map of the World is an artistic presentation of a world map created by an unknown artist sometime between 1580 and 1590 CE. The engraving takes the form of a court jester with the face replaced by cordiform (heart-shaped or leaf-shaped) world map based on the designs of cartographers such as Oronce Finé, Gerardus Mercator, and Abraham Ortelius.\nThe map featured in the artwork is based on Abraham Ortelius's Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, which is one of the most referenced world maps in history. It also appears to draw inspiration from a foolscap map created in 1575 by the French mapmaker Jean de Fourmont. There is wide speculation that it was created by members of a Christian sect called the Familists, which valued global viewpoints while stressing the importance of self-reflection. In the left-hand corner, the name Orontius Fineus is inscribed, which is Latinized for Oronce Finé, a French mathematician and cartographer who died in 1555. Because the publication of Fool's Cap was so long after Finé's death, the inscription is not thought to represent him as the artist but rather the subject of the work's ridicule.\nThe late sixteenth century was the height of Europe's Age of Exploration, and the Fool's Cap Map of the World appears to be a commentary on the foolishness of the era's hubris to think that they had the world figured out. The picture also has elements of a vanitas work of art, reminding viewers of their limitations. It features multiple quotes in Latin to illustrate these points. The fool holds a sceptre that reads (translated) \"Vanity of vanities, all is vanity,\" from Ecclesiastes. The cap is emblazoned with, \"O head, worthy of a dose of hellebore.\" Hellebore is a poisonous flower that was used at the time to treat madness. The ears of the cap feature a quote from the Roman philosopher Lucius Annaeus Cornutus that reads, \"Who doesn't have donkey's ears?\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "revision_id": 1219834545,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Noctule is a British musical project founded by Serena Cherry, best known as the lead guitarist and co-lead vocalist of Svalbard, in 2020. Launched as a personal creative outlet amidst the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, Cherry considered the project to be a return to her roots as a black metal solo artist, prior to forming Svalbard in 2011, with its video game-inspired lyrics contrasting with the aforementioned band's social and political themes.\nThe project's debut album, Wretched Abyss (2021), is musically and lyrically themed around the 2011 video game The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim; its songs focus on certain dungeons, storylines and weapons from the game. As of 2024, Cherry is working on a follow-up album, which will be about a different game.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history and Wretched Abyss (2020–2022) ===\nWhen she was 16 years old, Serena Cherry purchased a four-track recorder, a Jackson guitar and a Boss DR-110 Dr. Rhythm drum machine and began writing black metal songs, releasing three EPs under a moniker. A few years later, she hired a live band which opened for Gallhammer and Nachtmystium, though it eventually fell apart and she returned to working on music on her own. Cherry later formed the post-hardcore band Svalbard with Liam Phelan and Mark Lilley in 2011. Cherry said that her black metal element \"never stopped but it simmered down\" whilst in the band, and that she \"always found I had way more [blackended] ideas than I could cram into a Svalbard album\"; some of the riffs that would be used with Noctule were originally written for Svalbard but deemed unfit for the band's sound.\n\nIn 2020, after losing her job and the cancellation of Svalbard's tours for that year due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated lockdowns, Cherry began playing The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (2011) and returned to writing black metal music. She soon became inspired by the game and its accompanying soundtrack and decided to theme her music around them. \"I wrote three songs instrumentally, just for fun\", Cherry told NME in 2021, \"Then I thought 'Oh, I might write one song about my favourite weapon…' And then, 'maybe I should write about my favourite dungeon' ... And it snowballed from there! It felt like such a natural pairing that it would have been mad not to just run with it.\" Cherry named her project \"Noctule\" after the bat of the same name, feeling that the name \"[sounded] quite black metal\". Cherry wrote the project's debut album, Wretched Abyss, in under a year's time, and she produced and recorded it with co-producer Matt Francis, who mixed, mastered, and contributed some riffs to the album. Cherry played every instrument on the album, and taught herself how to program drums (instead of using drum loops) and use Logic Pro during its production. The album and its title track is named after Hermaeus Mora, one of Skyrim's Daedric Princes. Lyrically, Cherry said that she made \"a really deliberate choice to go, 'I'm not going to talk about anything to do with me on this record.' The only emotion on the album is how much I love the dungeons in Skyrim.\"\nCherry had not planned on releasing Noctule's music publicly, but was prompted to by Sammy Urwin of Church Road Records. Wretched Abyss was released on 28 May 2021 to generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its songwriting and melodic qualities. Metal Hammer listed the album as one of the top 10 black metal albums of 2021. The positive reception led to Noctule receiving offers to play gigs, leading Cherry to recruit a live band for the project, featuring Francis on guitar and Rhys Griffiths, formerly of Extreme Noise Terror, on drums. Noctule played its first show on 7 May 2022 in Camden, England, on the Underworld Stage of the 2022 Incineration Fest. In August 2022, the band played at Church Road Records' 5th Birthday Bash at the Black Heart in London. Noctule was put \"on hold\" following these performances as Cherry returned to her normal job and touring, leaving her with no time to write black metal, and because she found Noctule's performances too expensive and time-consuming for her to make into a regular occurrence.\n\n\n=== Upcoming second album (2023–present) ===\nCherry had already begun planning Noctule's second album prior to the release of Wretched Abyss. She initially indicated that it would be a \"choral black metal\" album themed to Sovngarde, Skyrim's in-game afterlife. In a 2023 interview with Decibel, Cherry said that \"exploring my passion for games by writing songs about them is definitely what Noctule is about now\", and that the project's next album would now be about a different game. As of February 2024, Cherry is working on the album.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n\nSingles\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHowkins, Jessica (3 July 2021). \"Noctule: Knower Of The Unknown\".

Among the Nepenthes species associated with N. orbiculata are Nepenthes andamana and Nepenthes mirabilis to which it is sympatric. Particularly, Nepenthes orbiculata is closely related to N. mirabilis but is different in its globose pitchers and its pitcher hip just below the lid, whereas the pitcher in N. mirabilis is more elongate, and the pitcher hip is at the center or in the lower half.. Similarly, Nepenthes orbiculata is closely related to N. mirabilis var. globosa in its glabrous leaves, or leaves with fimbriate margins, and globose pitcher with hip just below the lid. However, N. mirabilis var. globosa is different from N. orbiculata in its climbing habit reaching up to 5 m, and having pitcher that are elongate with lower hips apart from globose ones with hip just below the lid, whereas N. orbiculata is a low shrub about 50 - 150 cm long. Additionally, N. orbiculata is sympatric with N. mirabilis, while N. mirabilis var. globosa is not. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe specific epithet is derived from Latin orbiculatus, meaning round.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThis species is endemic and known only from two populations in Phang Nga Province, in Peninsular Thailand. \n\n\n== Ecology ==\nNepenthes orbiculata grows in sandy soils, in savannahs and grasslands at sea level.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Avigdor Willenz (Hebrew: אביגדור וילנץ; born in 1957, Rehovot, Israel) is an Israeli entrepreneur in the electronics field, venture capitalist, billionaire, and philanthropist.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nAvigdor Willenz was born in 1957 in Rehovot. He studied at the High School near the university and then dropped out. After a pre-military service year in Kibbutz Raim, he served in the IDF as an officer in the Armored Corps during the First Lebanon War, as a tank platoon deputy commander in the 362nd Battalion, among other roles in the Sultan Yacoub battle. Willenz is a graduate of the Technion in Electrical Engineering.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHe began his professional career in the early 1980s at Elbit, where he worked on developing computer infrastructures for the Lavi and F-16 combat aircraft. In 1988, he moved to the United States for residence, during which he specialized in developing half-conductor devices, resigned from Elbit, and joined Integrated Device Technology (IDT). At IDT, Willenz met Manuel Alba, who became his partner in companies he later founded. After three and a half years in the United States, he returned to Israel.\nIn 1993, he founded Galileo Technologies, which develops VLSI components. In 1997, Willenz took Galileo public on NASDAQ, and in October 2000, he led its sale to the American company Marvell Technology, which paid $2.7 billion for 25% of Galileo's shares.\nHe invested in the British advertising company QXL, which was sold after two years for $1.9 billion, yielding a profit of $330 million to the Israeli investor group. He invested in several startups, including \"Liva Semiconductor\", which was sold to Cisco Systems in 2016 for $320 million.\nIn July 2011, he was listed among the founding investors in Annapurna Labs, responsible for developing server chips for Amazon AWS. Annapurna Labs was sold in 2015 to the American company Amazon for about $370 million.\nIn 2016, he was the president and the first investor of the Litebits company. That same year, together with David Dehan and Ran Halutz, he founded Habana Labs, which develops processors for artificial intelligence applications. He was also the first investor in the company and served as its chairman of the board. In December 2019, the company was sold to the American company Intel for $2 billion. Following this deal, Forbes Israel estimated his wealth at $2.7 billion.\nHe was philanthropists of organizations such as Breaking the Silence, B'Tselem, Adalah, and Rabbis for Human Rights. As an environmental activist, he contributed to the Society for the Protection of Nature and the Jewish National Fund, an organization dedicated to preserving open spaces in Israel.\n\n\n== Private life ==\nIn 2021, Willenz moved to the canton of Bern in Switzerland, where he resides with his partner. His children and grandchildren live in Israel.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"The chip billionaire who left for a cabin in the Alps breaks his silence: 'The state is committing suicide'\", Globes\n\"The state is abusing those who pay taxes: the chip billionaire who left for a cabin in the Alps breaks his silence\", Globes\n\"Marvell to acquire LAN-chip supplier Galileo for $2.7 billion in stock\", EE Times\n\"The CEO who stayed in the bunker\", Ynet",

        "content": "Francis Thomas (10 April 1912 – 12 October 1977) was an English-born Singaporean former politician and educator. He was a founding member of political party Labour Front and served as the Minster of Communications and Works from 1955 to 1958 during the 1st Legislative Assembly of Singapore.\nIn 1959, he retired from politics and returned to education, serving as the principal of Saint Andrew's Secondary School from 1963 to 1974. In 1958, then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew described him as \"the only honest man in the Labour Front\".\n\n\n== Early life and military career ==\nThomas was born on 10 April 1912 in a village in Westcotes, Leicester. He was the fourth of six children to his mother and father. His father, J. A. Thomas, was a priest. He was educated at the University of Cambridge. He started working at Saint Andrew's Secondary School in 1934.\nDuring World War II, Thomas temporarily stopped working as Saint Andrew's to serve in the war. Thomas was stationed at a hill known as the Kamu Death Camp. In 1944, he was selected to go to Japan. He first took a truck to Singapore and was kept at a POW-camp at Zion Road. Afterwards, he went to Japan using a captured American ship called the President Harrison. Whilst they were travelling, American submarines off the coast of Vietnam started launching torpedos them, sinking a few ships.\nHis ship was later hit and after it sank, he went onto a Japanese lifeboat. Afterwards, he jumped off and swam, encountering another group of British soldiers around an overturned lifeboat. By morning, they got the lifeboat upright and had an English-speaking Japanese officer with them. Thomas and his lifeboat were later rescued by a Japanese airplane due to the Japanese officer on board. He was taken to a hospital ship with about 600 survivors on board.\nWhen he made it to Japan, Thomas was taken to a quarantine island. He worked on the island and became a corporal. He worked 8-hour days and later fell sick, being transported to the camp hospital and later to a different shelter, due to frequent bombings from the Americans. He later witnessed the bombing of Nagasaki.\nAfterwards, he took a hospital ship back to Southampton, Hampshire. After staying there for a year, he returned to Singapore in 1947 and continued working at Saint Andrew's Secondary School.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Political career ===\nIn 1954, Thomas founded Labour Front along with David Marshall and Lim Yew Hock, and, after the 1955 general election, became a Nominated Member of Parliament and served as the Minister of Communications and Works in the Labour Front government.\nIn 1955, Thomas was involved in helping stop the Hock Lee bus riots and, in 1956, went to England to look into the possibility of nationalising the transportation system.\nIn 1959, Thomas resigned from his role as Minister of Communications and Works after the chief minister asked him to give up his ministry. In 1960, Thomas dissolved Labour Front stating that the \"decision to dissolve was unanimous\".\n\n\n=== Educational career ===\nIn 1963, Thomas became the principal to Saint Andrew's. In 1974, after serving as the principal for 10 years, left Saint Andrew's and retired from teaching the following year.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nThomas became a naturalized Singaporean citizen in 1957, along with his wife.\n\n\n=== Death and legacy ===\nOn 12 October 1977, Thomas died of cancer. He is survived by his wife Catherine Eng Neo Thomas (née Lee) and their three daughters. Saint Andrew's Secondary School flew their flag at half-mast out of respect for him.\nIn 1978, the Thomas Francis Award was named after him and was awarded for the first time at the Shaw Foundation.\nOn the 118th Founder's Day of Saint Andrew's Secondary School, a road leading to the school was named Francis Thomas Drive, after him.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hyvät herrat (Good Gentlemen) is a Finnish political satire series produced between 1990 and 1996. The series was shown in 1990–1992 on Kolmoskanava and in 1993–1996 on MTV3. Aarno Laitinen was the screenwriter of the series, with his assistant mainly Lasse Lehtinen under the pseudonyms Saara Lenso, Serita Numintio and Sole Sarana. For a few years, together with Laitisen and Lehtinen, Yleisradio's political editor Jarkko Juselius wrote the series. The director of the series was Pertti Melasniemi and the producer was Jarmo Porola. A total of 207 episodes were made in the series. In 1999, the 15-part continuation series Herrat nauraa was completed, which was a continuation of the original series.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe main characters of the series are business advisor Johannes Paukku (Matti Tuominen), a sausage manufacturer who got rich with \"Paukku's Run\" and his son-in-law Raimo \"Tollo\" Koskivuo (Eero Melasniemi), a social democratic politician, whom Yleni promoted from MP to party secretary and minister during the series. In each episode, Paukku and Tollo organized a sauna evening and invited a political guest or other well-known public figure, with whom they tried to talk into favoring their own political projects, along with saunas, sowing and drinking. Sales advisor Pauku's role model was reportedly business leader and business organization influencer Heikki Tavela.\nIn order to get up-to-date political remarks, the week's episode was filmed in 1990 on Mondays and the program came out on TV the evening of the same day, which was why they read the same day's afternoon newspapers. From the spring of 1991, the day of recording was moved to Tuesday, until the end of the series. This gave the staff one day more time to make the series. The filming location for the series was the Park Hotel Käpylä in Käpylä, Helsinki, which has been operating under the name Finlandia Park Hotel Helsinki since February 2017.\nThe screenwriter Lasse Lehtinen has recalled that several well-known male actors were considered for the role of sales advisor Pauku, starting with Lasse Pöysti and Pentti Siimes. The requirement was that the actor to be chosen was absolutely sober. For this reason, according to Lehtinen, the task turned out to be difficult, because almost all the male actors who were free at the time had an alcohol problem. Director Pertti Melasniemi demanded and got Matti Tuominen as sales advisor Pauku. Lasse Lehtinen has considered Tuominen's choice to be successful, as he skillfully embraced the role of Pauku. When Tuominen was chosen, he was still relatively unknown to the general public, although he already had a long career as a theater actor behind him. Tuominen's son, actor Sakari Tuominen, has said that in his private life, his father was more or less the complete opposite of Pauku, shy and modest in nature and rather a sidekick than the center of the group.\nThe characters of Good Gentlemen were well-characterized and its humor was often snarky. Sales advisor Paukku was a chauvinistic and whiny industrialist, Tollo, on the other hand, a sleazy political gambler. With the help of the characters, the good brother network of politics was caricatured, where decisions are plotted in cabinets and sauna evenings \"behind the people's backs\". In addition, Paukku and Tollo indulged in high life, drinking, and occasional side-jumping (the business advisor lived in Barcelona, ​​and Mrs. Koskivuoka never appeared in the series either). In the episodes of the first year, the sauna guests' backs were washed by the sower Armi (Eila Pehkonen). The actor Pehkonen died in September 1991, and until the end of the program's life, he was replaced by Tyyne Hurskainen (Anja Pohjola), who commented on politics from her own perspective of a \"revolutionary front-line\". During the series, the sauna group was served \"turpentine\" by several waiters, first Pia (Sarina Röhr), then Timo (Mikko Roiha), whom Paukku called Håkan, and finally Dr. Samuel Livingstone Matabele (Billy Carson). Paukku treated the waiter characters with open disdain, which was meant to reflect prejudices against women, sexual minorities, immigrants and animal activists. However, according to the director Melasniemi, Paukku was always the one who misbehaved, got picked on and was laughed at in the end.\n\n\n== Guests ==\nIn each episode of the series, a Finnish politician or other public figure appeared as himself. Although Paukku and Tollo could put their guests behind their backs and in front of them cheaply, there were always enough guests for the show, because they got media publicity and the opportunity to present their own thoughts on a popular television show. This is how real politics and the satire of the screenwriters were mixed in \"Good Gentlemen\". Paukku's sauna was visited by the highest leadership of the kingdom, including ministers. According to Lasse Lehtinen, who wrote the program, the politicians actually competed to be included in the program, and only a few, such as Paavo Väyrynen, refused the invitation.\nThe Prime Minister Esko Aho participated in the making of the series and appeared in the filming, but at the last drop he refused to air the episode. The Russian diplomat Viktor Vladimirov, on the other hand, had promised to join Good Gentlemen, but canceled his arrival a day before filming. Vladimirov was replaced at short notice by writer and politician Jörn Donner.\nPresident Mauno Koivisto was supposed to join an episode of \"Good Gentlemen\" to play volleyball with Tollo for the Sikariporras team. The day before the shooting, there were government negotiations, and in order to mix fact and fiction, Pertti Melasniemi sent Tollo with the film crew to the location to comment on the government negotiations. When the afternoon papers reported the next day that Tollo participated in the formation of the government, the republican president's office was informed that the president wanted to transfer his participation to Good gentlemen. Melasniemi interpreted that Koivisto would never be seen in the series.\nAccording to Tapani Ruokanen, the author of President Martti Ahtisaari's biography, in 1992 and 1993 Hyvät herrrat helped pave the way for Ahtisaari to become the president of the republic. Ahtisaari's name as a possible future presidential candidate came up in an episode of Good Gentlemen that was shown at the beginning of September 1992. A couple of weeks later, Aarno Laitinen wrote a column in Iltalehti with the title \"Could it be Martti Ahtisaari?\" Lasse Lehtinen was on bad terms with SDP's long-term chairman and four-time prime minister, Kalevi Sorsa, and wanted to prevent Sorsa from becoming a presidential candidate. The later chairman of the SDP, Eero Heinäluoma, said in Ahtisaari's biography: \"The essential thing was that Lasse Lehtinen, a propagandist who was even more skilled than Göbbels, set out to push Ahtisaari for the presidency, systematically and using the entire media. He influenced through his fellow journalists in all media”.\n\n\n=== Partial list of guests ===\nSauli Niinistö \nTarja Halonen \nMartti Ahtisaari\nElisabeth Rehn \nMatti Vanhanen \nJuha \"Junnu\" Vainio\nBen Zyskowicz \nJörn Donner\nIlkka Kanerva \nPirkko K. Koskinen\nSanelma Vuorre\nTuovi Allén\nHannele Luukkainen\nKerttu Törnqvist\nLeif Salmén\nLeena Harkimo\nEero Paloheimo\nRiitta Suominen\nRuben Stiller\n\n\n== Impact ==\nHyvät herrat was a popular show throughout its lifetime: for example, the episode broadcast on 6 April 1993 drew 1.4 million viewers. The series made its main star, the sales advisor Pauku, a cult figure, and this echoed in almost every episode from the cry \"Personnel, turpentine!\" (Henkilökunta, tärpättiä!) came the flying phrase. At the same time, the visit of high-ranking politicians in the program, which often cultivates dark humor, also aroused indignation. In the mid-1990s, the current affairs program Mediapeli, shown on MTV3, organized a studio discussion and a viewer survey on the topic \"Is it appropriate for ministers to visit the Gentlemen show?\". The illustration used was the post-May Day episode of Good Gentlemen, where Paukku and Tollo wake up from a drinking hole wearing May Day masks.\n\n\n== Sequels ==\nIn 1999, a short sequel was made to the series called Herrat nauraa.\nIn the winter of 2006–2007, MTV3 aired a new series, Donna Paukku, in which Johannes Paukku's illegitimate daughter arrives in Finland and begins to sauna guests with the help of Tollo and Tyyne. Of the actors of the old series, only Anja Pohjola, who played Tyyne Hurskais, was involved. Aarno Laitinen opted out of the Donna Paukku series, but he could not prevent it from being done under the copyright law.\n\n\n== Reruns ==\nThe episodes of the series in the first years were repeated on the Sunday morning after the premiere. Episodes of the series were rerun in the summer of 1998.[ During the 2006 presidential elections, three episodes of the fifth season were repeated, which were visited by presidential candidates Matti Vanhanen, Tarja Halonen and Sauli Niinistö. In addition, in the summer of 2006, MTV3 aired eight selected episodes from 1990 to 1992 as a wish list.\n\n\n== Title theme ==\nThe theme music of the series and other synthesizer music in the program was made by Jussi Halme. In 2022, Halme and a Finnish hip-hop and R&B singer-artist collaborated on an updated version of Hyvie herrö's signature theme, as the original series soundtracks had been destroyed in MTV's archives.\n\n\n== Intro ==\n\n\n=== 1993 ===\nIn 1993, the episodes used an intro in which the Table Frame appears on a cloudy background, where the most central people of the series appear alternately: sales advisor Paukku, Tollo Koskivuo, Tyyne Hurskainen and bartender Timo, in later episodes Samuel Livingstone Matabele.\n\n\n=== 1994-1996 ===\nAt the beginning of the episodes from 1994 to 1996, a computer-generated animation by Seppo Välimäki was used as its intro. The animation in question later became an internet meme, earning the nickname \"Bowling Alley screens when you get a Strike\".\nAt the beginning of the animation, the parliament building is depicted. The \"lump\" rumbles along the ground to the steps of the parliament building. The \"pillars\" of the House of Parliament look on and the \"lump\" moves from the stairs to the central pillar. At the same time, the other columns start running out of the picture. The middle column begins to bulge, and the face of Sales Advisor Pauku begins to appear, smiling widely. Suddenly, Pauku's face freezes, and remains under the banknote. After a while, the picture shows a 100-mark bill with the face of the sales advisor. Raimo T. Koskivuo takes the bill into his pocket and after a moment Koskivuo disappears inside the coffee cup shown in the picture. Then Tyyne Hurskainen takes the cup and drinks coffee, when suddenly the picture becomes strange and the bartender Samuel Livingstone Matabele appears in the picture. After that, he crumbles into little pink balls. The bartender sweeps up the shattered balls, and at the end, the roof of the parliament building collapses.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nIn the main roles\n\nMatti Tuominen as trade advisor Johannes Paukku\nEero Melasniemi as Member of Parliament/Party Secretary/Minister of Chancellery Raimo \"Tollo\" Koskivuo\nEila Pehkonen as sower Armi (1990–1991)\nAnja Pohjola as sower Tyyne Hurskainen (1991–1996, 1999)\nSarina Röhr as bartender Pia (1990–1991)\nMikko Roiha as bartender Timo/Håkan (1992–1993)\nBilly Carson as South African-born bartender Dr. Samuel Livingstone Matabele (1993–1996)\n\n\n== Cameo roles ==\nSales advisor Paukku made a cameo role in Ere Kokkonen's movie Vääpeli Körmy - taisteluni. In the film, when negotiations are underway to end the war between Finland and Sweden, the commander of the Swedish army is softened up by taking him to Pauku's sauna.\n\n\n== Homages ==\nThe sauna facilities at Park Hotel Käpylä are named after the series characters Pauku, Tollo and Tyyne.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Fort Culion is a citadel built in 1740 during the Spanish-era in the Philippines. The Recollect Augustinians constructed the fort to defend themselves from Muslim invaders. The structure was built of stone, square-shaped, and with four bastions. \n\nIn 1930, the Jesuits used the coral stones used on the fort to build the walls of the Immaculate Conception Parish Church, also known as Culion Church. The fort, now in ruins, currently serves as a lighthouse. Its canons are still visible\nThe National Historical Commission of the Philippines declared the fort as a historical landmark in 1939.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Danger is the third Korean EP by South Korean duo Super Junior-D&E, a sub-unit of the boy band Super Junior. The album was released on April 15, 2019, by SM Entertainment and Label SJ, and distributed by Dreamus. The album consists of seven tracks including the lead single of the same name and two previously released songs from their second Japanese full-length album that were re-recorded into Korean from Japanese.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn April 2, 2019, Label SJ released an image teaser and announced that Super Junior-D&E will have a Korean comeback on April 15, following their previous release last August with 'Bout You. Unlike their previous their usual colorful teaser photos, this time the label shows the members in a black-and-white photo, exuding a mysterious aura. In the same post, the label outlined the comeback schedule leading up to the album's offline release on April 15. During Donghae's teaser photo release on April 3, the label announced that the EP will come in two versions — \"Red\", and \"Black\", and two songs from their second full-length Japanese album, Style are going to be included in this release in their re-recorded Korean version due to their positive reception during their initial release. On April 4, teaser photos of Eunhyuk was released. On April 10, the highlight medley of the EP was uploaded on YouTube.\nBefore the album's release, the duo held their first solo concert in Olympic Hall, Seoul from April 13–14, marking their domestic concerts in South Korea.\nOn April 14, the music video for the lead single, \"Danger\" was released alongside the digital EP, followed by the physical copy of the EP the following day.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nThe EP consists of seven tracks consisting of various genres ranging from trap, hip hop, nu-disco, and R&B. The band stated that they wanted to show their masculine side and be real men. Speaking of the album's black and red colors, Eunhyuk states that the former symbolizes charisma, while the latter is \"sexiness.\" Donghae recounted the inspiration to write the EP came from horse racing, and invites the fans to run alongside them without looking sideways. \nThe opening track, \"Danger\" is an electro house song with trap influences to bring out the charismatic personalities of the members. Penned by Donghae and J-DUB, the song featured dark sounds with minor chord progression with its lyrics playfully likening the expression of \"ding\" as \"danger.\" \"Jungle\" is a trap song with strong synthesizer sound, reminiscent to a jungle. The lyrics were written as a first-person who sees everything.\n\"Gloomy\" is an R&B song with an 808 bass sound and a somber electric guitar melody to amplify the song's emotions. Its melancholic lyrics were penned by Donghae. The music video for the track was released on April 12, two days before their Seoul concert, and it was directed by their bandmate Shindong. \"Watch Out\" is a pop song with a groovy rhythm with its lyrics warning the listeners during one that fell in love with someone dangerous. \"Dreamer\" is a pop ballad song with mellow melody and a dynamic burst of sound in its chorus. The lyrics sympthasizes with someone suffering from anxiety. The track was written by Tha Aristocrats, the production team behind labelmate Exo's \"Overdose.\"\nThe EP concludes with the Korean versions of \"Sunrise\" and \"If You\", the tracks that were previously released in Japanese.\n\n\n== Promotion ==\n\nThe duo embarked on their second Asia tour, \"The D&E\", to promote the EP from April 13–August 28, visiting five countries, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Japan. Its Seoul stops were held two days before the release of the EP, in which the duo performed several tracks of the EP — \"Danger\", \"Watch Out\", \"Gloomy\", and \"Jungle\", for the first time.\nThey performed \"Watch Out\" and \"Danger\" on Music Bank on April 19, followed by a return performance a week later on April 26 for the latter track. The duo performed \"Gloomy\" on MBC's Music Core on April 20.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Sales ==\nAccording to Gaon Chart, the EP debuted in 97th with over 1,100 sold copies in South Korea.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Metropolitan Club is a women's club in San Francisco, California. Their clubhouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Woman's Athletic Club of San Francisco.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1915, a group of local women established the Woman's Athletic Club of San Francisco to promote physical fitness and camaraderie among women and modeled it after the Woman's Athletic Club of Chicago. It was the first women's athletic club west of the Mississippi.\nThe clubhouse was built in phases in 1917 and 1923. The site was selected in the Union Square neighborhood three blocks south of the Pacific-Union gentlemen's club. \nIn 1938, the club opened the Kakemono Lounge, a cocktail lounge decorated with Japanese influences. In 1941 during World War II, the club extended dining privileges to women working in the Red Cross Motor Corps. In 1945, the club hosted wives of delegates during the establishment of the United Nations. In 1953, the club converted the lounge into a library.\nIn 1966, the membership voted to change their name to the \"Metropolitan Club\" to reflect their broader mission beyond just athletics. In the 1980s, the club discussed but ultimately declined merging with the nearby Olympic Club, a then all-male athletic organization.\nIn 2004, while other women's club had declining membership in San Francisco, the Metropolitan was the largest partly through offering members incentives to recruit. The club is a popular rental venue for wedding receptions and other events.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe architectural partnership of Walter Danforth Bliss and William Baker Faville designed the clubhouse in an Italian Renaissance Revival style influenced by palazzos of Florence. The six-story building has a U-layout and is between a surface parking lot owned by the club and a former YWCA building owned by the Academy of Art University.\nThe front of the building uses materials of contrasting colors consisting of common bond red brick walls, cream-colored terra cotta details, black iron railings, and a red tile roof. The arched entry way has a rectangular frame with marble spandrels and spans the first and second stories. The third story has corbelled balconies in front of each window. The fourth floor has a pair of terra cotta escutcheons with the original WAC logo. The fifth and sixth floors have a two-story colonnade in front of a loggia. The other three sides of the building are relatively plain.\nThe interior includes a formal lobby with an ionic order of paired columns and pilasters supporting beams treated as an entablature. The swimming pool is dug into the basement based on structural considerations. The public dining room is on the fourth floor with a private dining room, known as the Tapestry Room. The building also contains a gym, locker rooms, spa, salon, offices, kitchens, conference rooms, and hotel rooms available to guests of members.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nFrancisca Club\nList of women's clubs\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in San Francisco\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n640 Heritage Preservation Foundation",

        "content": "The convent of Sacramentine or church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus is a religious building located in Vigevano, in the province of Pavia and diocese of Vigevano.\n\n\n== Description and history ==\nThe Perpetual Adorers of the Blessed Sacrament (also called Sacramentine nuns) were founded on 16 April 1770 by mother Maria Maddalena dell'Incarnazione, born Caterina Sordini, of Porto Santo Stefano. Having entered a Franciscan convent at the age of eighteen, during one night (known as night of the Light and remembered by Sacramentine on 19 February) she had a vision of Jesus in the form of the Holy Eucharist: she therefore worked to found an order with main purpose the adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. The order was recognized by Pope Pius VII on 13 February 1818. The first monastery was placed in Rome, in the former Monastery of Sant'Anna alle Quattro Fontane.\nThe Sacramentine Sisters arrived in Vigevano from Turin on 6 June 1876 at the request of the then bishop Monsignor Pietro De Gaudenzi, who wanted to establish a place in the city where it was possible to carry out continuous adoration of the Blessed Sacrament Eucharist. The first headquarters was in the current Monastery of the Dominicans, in Vicolo Deomini, built specifically for them by Bishop De Gaudenzi between 1873 and 1876. However, soon the monastery it became too small, given the high number of novices. In 1908, Donna Francesca Manara Negrone donated land in Via Trento to the nuns, where the new monastery was built. On 20 June 1910, with the blessing of the bishop Monsignor Pietro Berruti, the first stone was laid, and on 6 June 1912 the nuns moved definitively to the new headquarters.\nThe new monastery was designed by a nun architect, Maria del Sacro Cuore Vittadini, with the supervision of a priest architect, Monsignor Spirito Maria Chiappetta. It has neo-Gothic shapes, inspired by French Gothic, with three naves and side chapels; the nuns' choir is located in the polygonal choir, a cloistered area. The façade is tripartite, high and slender and was completed in 1914. The church has a bell tower, in which there are three hammer-like bells. The interior is totally built with Candoglia marble, with stucco vaults painted with neo-Gothic motifs. Among the paintings present in the side altars, there are that of the Addolorata by Enrico Reffo and that of the Sacred Heart by Giovan Battista Garberini. Behind the main altar there is a wrought iron grate by Maurizio Beolchi, which separates the church from the monastic choir. The choir was created by Antonio Baldi. To the left of the main altar there is a chapel with a grate, from which the nuns attend Mass and receive the Eucharist; on the right, above the sacristy, there is a women's gallery in which, in turn, the nuns worship the Blessed Sacrament.\nAbove the choir is the large neo-Gothic pipe organ case, also visible from the accessible part of the church. The organ comes from the first monastery in Vicolo Deomini, was built by Carlo I Vegezzi Bossi in 1876 and was partially rebuilt at the end of the nineteenth century by Alessandro Mentasti. Subsequently, the nuns asked Mentasti first and then Alessandro Krengli to build a new one with two keyboards, starting from the old one. The large organ was restored in 2019 by Sergio Castegnaro according to the directives of the Superintendency.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Bailiwick of Stalmine is an unusual historical title located in the township of Stalmine within the extensive parish of Lancaster, Lancashire, England. Although called a bailiwick, it functioned effectively as a lordship of the manor and was inherited as such.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe bailiwick was under the control of a bailiff appointed by the Lords of Furness, the monks of Furness Abbey. Stalmine lies in the area known as Fylde, deriving its name from the Old English and Norse meaning \"a pool or stream at the mouth of the river\".\nThe monks of Furness Abbey held land in Stalmine since the 12th century. Founded in 1127, the abbey was granted lands including Stalmine by large landowners. In around 1200, Robert de Stalmine granted monks land called Corocola from his estate, forming the basis of the subsequent bailiwick. Over the next 200 years, through grants like those of William and Henry de Stalmine in 1240, the abbey expanded its lands in the township.\nBy the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536, the Abbey of Furness had obtained the whole manor of Stalmine. This fell to the Crown, making subsequent English monarchs the Lords of the Bailiwick until 1666. As a reward for helping restore the monarchy, King Charles II granted the former abbey lands including Stalmine to George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle.\nThe bailiwick descended through the Dukes of Albemarle until the death of the 1st duke's childless son in 1687. It then passed through marriage to the Dukes of Buccleuch until 1827. In 1835, the 5th Duke of Buccleuch sold much of the Lancashire estate, including the Bailiwick of Stalmine, to Peregrine Towneley. The bailiwick remains in private ownership today.\n\n\n== Tenants ==\nRents from the bailiwick's tenants, which amounted to £10 10s 1d per year, were collected for Towneley in 1846 and later Lords O'Hagan. Tenants in the bailiwick included the De Stalmines and De Oxleys in the 13th century. An agreement in 1318 regulated Nicholas de Oxley's improvement of waste land and the abbey's rights of way.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBailiwick of Guernsey\nBailiwick of Jersey\nLord of the manor\n\n\n== References ==\nA private treaty sale of Lordships of the Manor with Windermere alias Undermillbeck, Cumbria & Bailiwick of Stalmine, Lancashire",

        "content": "The church of San Martino is a religious building located in Vigevano.\n\n\n== Description and history ==\n\nNow deconsecrated, the church of San Martino is located in a closed courtyard with a gate, at the end of via Palestro. It was an ancient title of the collegiate parish church of Sant'Ambrogio.\nAccording to some historians, it could be the matrix of all the churches of Vigevano, with the name of San Pietro. In the first official document in which Vigevano is mentioned (year 963) there is mention of an archpriest Grauso, \"archpriest at the church of S. Pietro in Vico and custodian of a basilica in castro Vicogeboin dedicated to St. Ambrose...\". According to Alessandro Colombo, the church was the basilica in which the bishops of a presumed diocese of Piccolini officiated, with the name of San Pietro in silva carbonaria; finally, a fresco on the left wall of the apse, still well preserved, depicting Saint Peter, would prove this dedication. But these are assumptions.\nWe certainly know what Simone dal Pozzo reports, who writes: \"The Church of S. Martino is very ancient, which gave its name to the city gate under this name. During 1517 it was known as S. Michele\". In 1517 the municipality vowed to restore it during a ferocious plague. It was then used as a cemetery. After the vote, and the plague having passed, \"immediately with offerings the ancient building was thrown to the ground and it was reformed in the manner that can be seen\".\nIt was consecrated in 1508 by the Bishop of Novara. The fresco on the portal of the façade dates back to that period, depicting the Madonna sitting with the Child between Saints Roch and Martin, and another Saint holding a basket of flowers. Other frescoes, quite well preserved, are found inside on the left wall of the nave; ornamental graffiti are also visible inside. The \"sail\" vault of the sacristy is also interesting.\nIt was visited by Saint Charles in 1578: then it was held by the Franciscans or the Capuchins. There is still news of restorations to the bell tower in the year 1669.\nIn 1810 it was suppressed and sold, being then under the patronage of the Sacristy of the Church of Sant'Ambrogio.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Kamlakant Narayan Chari (born Comlo Naraina Chari; 17 November 1942 – 1 May 2014) was an Indian stage designer, light designer, and sound designer known for his work in Marathi theatre and tiatr productions.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nKamlakant Narayan Chari, originally named Comlo Naraina Chari, was born on 17 November 1942, in Parcem, Goa, which was a part of Portuguese India during the era of the Portuguese Empire. He was born into a Hindu family to parents Naraina Comlo Chari (later Narayan Kamla Chari), hailing from Corgao-Pernem, and Loximin (later Laxmi Narayan Chari), who was a homemaker. Chari showed a strong interest in painting, design, acting, and mechanical work since he was young. His artistic path began with participating in Marathi plays in nearby villages. His stage presence was known for his acting talent, which held the audience's interest. He showed a strong enthusiasm for stage design, offering helpful ideas to improve the overall visual impact of theatrical productions. As time progressed, Chari realized his potential for innovative stage setting. This realization ignited his passion and spurred him to explore new horizons in stage design.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn the early stages of his career, Chari faced the challenge of not having his own stage sets and curtains. To surmount this challenge, he utilized a stage setting facility located in Mapusa, where he obtained the required stage props. At times, he even took on the responsibility of transporting all the curtains via bicycle from Mapusa to Panjim, returning them the next day after the event had ended. Chari's work and diligence yielded rewards in both his personal and professional life. Despite not achieving considerable financial success from his stage setting services, he established a reputation as a creative and well-liked stage set designer. Chari dedicated over four decades of his life to serving the Konkani tiatr stage by supplying essential stage settings. He belonged to a new wave of stage set designers, employing modern techniques and approaches. Initially, he catered to amateur tiatrists, gradually earning the opportunity to collaborate with directors such as Jacinto Vaz, M. Boyer, Fr. Freddy J. Da Costa, Remmie Colaço, and others. Through his work, Chari established a leading position for himself within the tiatr stage community. Furthermore, Chari extended his talent and expertise to Marathi dramas from the 1970s onwards. His distinctive stage settings garnered accolades and recognition not only within Goa but also at the national level.\nChari had the privilege of representing Goa at the National Theatre festival known as Bharat Rang Mahotsav. This festival, jointly organized by the National School of Drama in New Delhi and the Nehru Centre in Mumbai, served as a platform for showcasing theatrical talent from across the country. Furthermore, Chari was an active participant in multiple state-level theater festivals across cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Pune, and Kolhapur. During the 20th century, the influx of tiatr directors from Bombay to Goa brought about an interesting collaboration. Given the abundance of stage sets in Bombay, owing to the widespread production of dramas called nataks, these directors would transport the sets along with their productions. However, Chari's skills as a stage set designer caught the attention of popular tiatr directors like Prem Kumar and C. Alvares. Upon discovering his talent, they sought his assistance, and Chari willingly joined forces with them. While traveling through diverse villages and cities, Chari shared his knowledge with various tiatr directors, accompanied by his son Kapil, who offered assistance along the way. Although Kapil's involvement initially lacked a serious commitment, it laid the foundation for his future contributions. Chari's impact on the commercial tiatr stage was significant. In a milestone, he introduced stage sets for the first time in a tiatr production written and directed by Jacinto Vaz, a comedian of the tiatr stage. The quality of Chari's stage sets did not go unnoticed, earning admiration from other figures within the tiatr community.\nDuring the peak period of tiatr stage shows, artists like M. Boyer, Prem Kumar, C. Alvares, Bab Peter, Mike Mehta, John Claro, Rosario Rodrigues, Roseferns, Prince Jacob, Pascoal, Mario Menezes, John D'Silva, Comedian Agostinho, Comedian Domnic, Peter Roshan, Fr. Freddy J. Da Costa, and others enlisted the skills of Chari to design stage sets for their tiatr performances. Chari's artistic abilities were not limited to the tiatr genre; he also showcased his creativity by designing unique stage sets for Chris Perry's musical productions in the 1970s. Chari's contributions were regarded in the annual competitions organized by the Kala Academy, where he crafted stage sets for the award-winning tiatrs of artists like Tomazinho Cardozo and Cezar D'Mello, among others. \nHis prowess in stage setting transcended cultural boundaries, as he left a mark on the Marathi stage as well. Nationally recognized for his set designing and execution, Chari's productions included Kalokh Det Hunkar, Junction Bharatpur, Themb Themb Abhal, Swapnavasavdatta, Pratima, Demaiz, Waiting Room, Natasamrat, Sandhya Chaya, Kulavadhu, and Naganand. In addition to his artistic endeavors, Chari dedicated himself to public service, serving as a panch (member) in the Merces village panchayat for a complete term from 1979 to 1983. Testament to his work and skill, Chari's collaboration with Prince Jacob's Production endured for a span of 28 years, starting around the year 1985. Chari's influence extended to other tiatr productions as well. He contributed his stage design skills to Augie D'Mello and Anil Kumar's tiatr lxob (2009), Joaquim Dias's tiatr Asha (2011), and Salvador Fernandes's tiatr Thank You Doctor (2011).\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOn 23 April 1979, Chari, aged 37, entered into matrimony with Bebi Babu Zo, a 28-year-old homemaker from Agaçaim. The couple underwent the process of civil marriage registration in Panaji, with Chari asserting his birthplace as Merces, Goa, despite the discrepancy with his birth certificate stating Parcem. Their son Kapil (born 1981), would later embark on a career as a stage designer in the realm of Konkani theater. Following the death of his father, Kapil embraced the responsibility of upholding and advancing his father's artistic legacy. He directed his focus towards stage sets, dedicating himself to the family business while eschewing involvement in the realms of decorations and sound systems. Chari, known for his proficiency in carpentry and painting curtains, was characterized by his strong work ethic, as he exhibited a greater inclination towards diligent labor rather than entrepreneurial pursuits.\nOn 1 May 2014, Chari, aged 71, breathed his last at Goa Medical College in Bambolim.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The church of Santa Maria intus vineas or church of Madonna di sotto is a religious building located in Vigevano, in province of Pavia and diocese of Vigevano.\n\n\n== Description and history ==\nIt is a very ancient church, prior to 1202, the year in which it was included among the dependencies of the Cistercian monastery of San Maiolo of Pavia. It was patronized by the Ardizzi family, one of the most illustrious fifteenth-century Vigevano families. In 1424 they took care of the restoration and reconstruction of the building, dedicating it to Santa Maria intus vineas.\nThe appearance of the building suggests an ancient temple with the four pillars of the small portico supporting the triangular tympanum. The apse has a semicircular plan, while the ceiling, currently very deteriorated, is coffered.\nThe church has great historical value; despite this, it has been abandoned for some time and the frescoes are now illegible. However, until a few decades ago, in the aedicule to the left of the altar, you could admire traces of a fifteenth-century Madonna and Child. Some frescoes were probably by the hand of the best artists of the ducal court such as Zanetto Bugatto, Bonifacio Bembo and Leonardo Ponzoni.\nOriginally, it was one of the many cemetery chapels in Vigevano that arose following the spread of Christianity in the area: others, now disappeared, were San Pietro intus vineas, San Vitale intus vineas and San Vincenzo in Prato. These chapels were dedicated to the Virgin, the Apostles and the Martyrs and indicated with the name of the vineyard, vegetable garden, meadow or field of a given Christian owner. Many of these were destroyed or confiscated during the persecutions; among others, there are also San Pietro in Rometta, San Martino and, with good probability, the Church of Misericordia.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie hosted the community of observant minor friars of Vigevano.\n\n\n== Description and history ==\nThe church and the convent were built between 1470 and 1475 to host the observant minor friars, along the road to Novara. The church was in Romanesque Franciscan style and took the shape of the church of the same name in Varallo. It had six chapels: the first dedicated to St. Bernardino or the Blessed Virgin (in which Cristoforo Macassoli from Milan, who died in the convent in 1485, was buried); the second in St. Firmus; the third to St. Francis; the fourth to St. Bonaventura; the fifth to St. Diego; the sixth to St. Anthony of Padua. The façade of the church was characterized by vague paintings. There was a painting of St. Ambrose and St. Bernardino.\nThe church was consecrated in 1578. In 1636 the Company of the Holy Sepulcher of Our Lord Jesus Christ was created here. Among the most important guests of this convent were Pacifico da Cerano, the aforementioned Macassoli, Bernardino Caimi and also Saint Bernardino of Siena, in Vigevano in 1431.\nThe church and convent were suppressed in 1805 and sold for 30,000 lire in 1810. A large part of the complex was demolished and the cloister was converted into private homes.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "James Hughes Stokes (c. 1814 or 1815 – December 27, 1890) was a Union Army officer during the American Civil War.\n\n\n== Life ==\nAccording to his obituary in The Inter Ocean, Stokes was born in Baltimore, in 1814, but Warner says he was \"probably\" born at Hagerstown, Maryland, in June 1815. In 1831 he was appointed to a cadetship at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He graduated in 1835, as 17th out of 56. Following service in the Seminole war, he received his commission as captain. In 1843 he resigned from the army, and from 1845 to 1858 was engaged in manufacturing and the railroad business. In 1859 he settled in Lake Forest, Illinois.\nWhen the Civil War began in 1861, there was a general search for small arms to supply the growing army, and Illinois Governor Richard Yates wanted to mount an expedition to seize the United States small arms from Jefferson Barracks at St. Louis, but as the barracks were surrounded by rebels, who were determined to take the guns for their own use, many military men declined to undertake it; but Stokes offered to try and was successful, receiving the thanks of the Illinois legislature. On July 31, 1862, he was commissioned captain of Illinois volunteer artillery, and did notable service in the battles of Perryville, Chickamauga and Missionary Ridge, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1864. On August 22, 1864, he was demoted to captain and assistant adjutant general, for reasons unknown.\nOn July 20 or 22, 1865, just after the end of the war, he was made Brigadier general of Volunteers, and one month later he was mustered out of service. For about fifteen years he made Chicago his residence and place of business. He then removed to New York City, where he lived the rest of his life. \nStokes died at his home in New York in the night of December 27, 1890, after an illness of a few days. A week prior he had walked from his residence to the post office, and afterwards contracted a cold, which developed into pneumonia. He left two sons, a daughter, and a widow, his second wife. The sons and daughter were then living in Chicago.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of American Civil War generals (Union)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBurley, Augustus Harris (1892).

        "content": "Taqua banana (\"chuối tá quạ\" in Vietnamese language) is a cultivated cooking banana cultivar, originating from Vietnam. This is a speciality fruit in Trà Vinh province. This cooking banana cultivar has many different characteristics, such as size and weight of the fruit, which are much larger than other banana cultivars. According to the belief of formerly Tra Vinh people, planting taqua banana would bring bad luck. Taqua banana produce few fruits, so in the past, Tra Vinh people only planted a few trees in the garden to get edible fruits or worship, but rarely planted it for trade. However, today, this fruit has become famous, breeding, cultivated and commonly sold on the market.\n\n\n== History and common name ==\nTaqua banana is originated from Cầu Kè district, Trà Vinh province. According to formerly beliefs, Cau Ke people spread word of mouth that planting this banana cultivar would bring bad luck. Especially at night, when the banana tree blooms and twists its body, it would make a very scary noise. The next morning, the bunch of young bananas had finished blooming. When people woke up and discovered this scene, they were \"tá hỏa\" (meaning panicky), meaning a state of panic and shock. According to the hypothesis, the name \"taqua banana\" (\"chuối tá quạ\" in Vietnamese language) was given according to the euphemistic pronunciation of the word \"tá hỏa\" due to the above conception or possibly because this banana fruit is so large that it makes people startled.\n\n\n== Description ==\nTaqua banana has a shape that is almost no different from a regular banana tree. The tree-trunk is small and weak, easily broken, so when the banana blooms, they must be used as a support. It is grown for about 8–9 months before bearing fruit. A bunch of taqua bananas usually grows about 2-3 hands, yielding about more than ten banana fruits. This banana cultivar has a special feature: the tree only bears fruit directly, not buds like regular bananas.\nTaqua bananas are famous due to this fruit looks much larger than the fruit of regular bananas, as large as a human wrist. Each taqua banana fruit can grown 35 – 45 cm in long (some fruits reach 50 cm) and have average weight of about 300 - 450 g/fruit (some fruits reach more than 1 kg). The heaviest record is 1,3 kg.\nTaqua banana fruits contain the same nutritional content as potatoes, rich in calories but high in vitamins (A, C and B-6) and essential minerals (magnesium and potassium). Eating taqua banana fruits is good for people at risk of stroke, osteoporosis and kidney disease. It also helps reduce constipation, diverticulitis and digestive diseases.\n\n\n== Culinary uses ==\nDifferent from regular banana varieties, taqua banana have to be processed and cooked, and are usually not eaten directly because this fruit is very mushy and has a very bland taste. Taqua banana are used as ingredients to prepare many dishes such as curry soup, hot pot, jam, cake..., but the most common cooking method is boiling. By boiling, when eaten, taqua banana would be very supple, fragrant and sweet and feel like there is honey inside. Because of their large size, when boiled, they are often tied tightly with string to prevent the skin from cracking, preventing water from seeping in and losing sweetness of banana fruits.\nThe traditional process of boiling taqua bananas is as follows: picking ripe taqua bananas, separating each hand to dry in the hot sun, then incubated for about two days until the banana turns yellow. Separate each fruit with a knife. Use a string to tie tightly around banana fruit (like a bánh tét) to keep the peel from cracking. When cooking, the water would not penetrate to prevent banana fruits from becoming mushy and having a bland taste. Pour boiling water to cover the fruit, then place bamboo mats or stones on top to prevent banana fruits from becoming gray with sap. Cooking for about an hour to a half, use chopsticks to gently test to feel the softness, then bring it down. Wait getting cool and then use a knife to slice it suitable because taqua banana fruits are long and large. Arrange on a plate and enjoy.\nTaqua bananas are processed into banana jam rather elaborate. After harvesting, bananas has ripen naturally for about 2–3 days to facilitate peeling. The banana pulp is sliced thinly, soaked with lime juice to remove the sap. Whole thin banana slices are deep fried in cooking oil. When well-done yellow, take it out, drain off oil and sprinkle the cooked sugar-water to soak in, the jam would be sweet.\n\n\n== Breeding and cultivation ==\nDue to the long planting time and difficulty in blooming, taqua banana has become scarce, which are specialty fruits in Cầu Kè district, Trà Vinh province. However, they adapt well to acid sulfate soil. Planting a garden is not simple, because they rarely sprout, each mother-tree usually only grows 1-2 seedlings, so digging up each seedling to plant a garden is rather difficult. Over time, small seedlings degenerate, susceptible to disease and poor fruit-quality leads to low profits. To reduce planting time, seedling tissue culture method is currently very popular. Usually, they would produce three harvests every 2 years.\nUse in vitro method for breeding. The suitable environment for taqua banana buds to regenerate is Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with compounds including napthan acetic acid (NAA) 0,1 mg/l, adenine hemisulfate 100 mg/l, coconut juice 10% v/v, sucrose 30gr/l, agar 8gr/l, 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) 5 mg/l, pH 5.8. Explants in complete darkness would give the highest number of regenerative buds. To achieve the optimal number of rapidly multiplying buds on taqua banana, it is necessary to use a medium with the following ingredients: Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with growth regulators including adenine hemisulfate 100 mg/l, coconut juice 10% v/v, sucrose 30gr/l, agar 8gr/l, BAP 7 mg/l, pH 5.8. To achieve the optimal rate of rooting, number of roots, root length, stem height as well as number of leaves/tree for complete regeneration of taqua banana, it is necessary to culture them in a medium with nutritious ingredients: MS supplemented with NAA at concentration of 1 mg/l, adenine hemisulfatehemisulfate 100 mg/l, coconut juice 10% v/v, sucrose 20gr/l, agar 8gr/l, pH was adjusted at 5.8. Banana trees, that are reared in rich soil substrate, muck and coconut humus at a ratio of 2:1:2, grow best.\nTissue culture produces healthy, disease-free seedlings with roots and leaves, absorbs soil and grows quickly. Planting at the same time makes it easy to care for and harvest banana bunches. Basal fertilizing, top-dressing, and water fully. Choosing to plant monoculture or polyculture (planting in the garden with other fruit trees) is fine. If planting polyculture, gardeners need to keep the distance wide enough for banana trees as well as enough light for 6–7 hours/day for the bananas to grow. If planting monoculture, gardeners should choose good soil and water fully. Although moisture is necessary, if taqua banana is waterlogged, after only 5–6 days of submerging the roots, the leaves would fold and dead-trees. Build a bed 50–60 cm high, planting distance 3×4 m/tree, place the tree in a hole 20 cm lower than the bed surface, in two rows, water and cover with grass to keep it moist regularly to take care of the tree. Fertilize with NPK 20–20–15, 3-4 times/year according to tree trunk size and leaf color, and cultivate dusty warm soil. To keep the beautiful shape, gardeners need to wrap the banana bunch with blue nylon bag, cut off flower under banana hands, wrap a spoonful of urea fertilizer to cover the position of the stem where cutting flower, supporting banana fruits grow larger. Taqua bananas would bloom after about 8–9 months; and bunches can be harvested after 6–7 months. Currently, the cooperative in district is supporting gardeners to plant taqua banana according to VietGAP regulations to ensure quality, adapt to climate change and clearly trace the origin of the products.\n\n\n== Trade ==\n\nPreviously, taqua banana produced few fruits and was believed to bring bad luck, so Tra Vinh people only planted it in few quantities in the garden, for the purpose of worshiping, eating or giving as a gift, but rarely planted it for trade. Nowadays, taqua bananas are no longer believed to bring bad luck but have become a cultivar that is propagated everywhere because this fruit has high nutritional value as well as economic value, and consumption demand is increasing. Currently, taqua bananas are sold on the market with prices ranging from 9,000 - 12,000 VND/fruit, retail price in Hanoi is up to 25,000 VND/fruit. For seedlings, the price ranges from 150,000 - 450,000 VND/seedling depending on the size.\nIn August 2022, Tan Qui Cooperative (An Phu Tan commune, Cầu Kè district) successfully researched and produced dried taqua banana jam products and sold them on the market. The people's committee of Trà Vinh province certified OCOP 3 stars for this product on December 30, 2022. This product does not use preservatives or additives to maintain the sweetness of bananas. Taqua banana jam is packaged, fully labeled and sold well on the market, rather attracting customers. On average, the cooperative purchases 1.2 - 1.5 tons of banana fruits/month and produces about 0.5 - 0.6 tons of dried banana jam. This product is sold at supermarkets and stores in neighboring provinces such as Cần Thơ, Vĩnh Long, Hồ Chí Minh city; customers in Hanoi also look to order products online. Along with traditional sales, the cooperative also connects with tiktokers to promote products at the garden, introduce production processes and livestream for sales. The OCOP program has contributed to improving the value, affirming the brand, and product quality for taqua bananas, and economic development for gardeners in Trà Vinh.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCầu Kè district, Trà Vinh province\nCooking banana\n\n\n== References ==",

He is a two-time Member of Parliament and also a former MLA from Anakapalli Constituency and a minister in the late Y. S. Rajasekhar Reddy government.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nRamakrishna was born in Anakapalli in a business family of Gavara Naidu community. His father is Konathala Venkat Rao.\n\n\n== Career ==\nRamakrishna started his political career with Indian National Congress in 1982. In 1989, he contested as an MP candidate of Congress from Anakapalli Parliamentary Constituency and won by a slender margin of 9 votes defeating Telugu Desam Party candidate P. Appalanarasimham. He retained the MP seat for Congress defeating the same candidate in 1991. However, he lost the same seat in the 1996 Indian General Election in Andhra Pradesh. \nIn the 2004 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly Election he won as a Congress candidate against Dadi Veerabhadra Rao of Telugu Desam Party. He was the Minister for Commercial Taxes in the late Y. S. Rajasekhar Reddy government from 2004 to 2009. In 2009, he lost the MLA seat to Ganta Srinivasa Rao of Praja Rajyam Party. After the death of former Chief Minister Y. S. Rajasekhar Reddy, he joined YSR Congress Party and supported Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy. But later, he quit the party. In June 2016, he staged a dharna to demand funds for the Babu Jagjeevanram Uttarandhra Sujala Sravanthi irrigation project. \nHe is nominated to contest the 2024 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly Election from Anakapalli Constituency on Jana Sena Party which he joined in January 2024. Thus, he joined his long-time political rival Dadi Veerabhadra Rao in the three-party political alliance of Telugu Desam, BJP and Jana Sena, and vowed to defeat YSRCP. He said that they were only political rivals but always had good relationship outside politics. However, many TDP cadre were unhappy that a turncoat was given the seat.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Max Yuan Hui (Chinese: 袁辉; pinyin: Yuán Huī; born August 1973) is a Chinese entrepreneur and AI expert who is the founder of Xiao-i (Shanghai Xiao-i Robot Technology Co., Ltd) and chairman of the Board & CEO of Xiao-I Corporation.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMax Yuan Hui earned an Executive Master of Business Administration (EMBA) degree from Guanghua School of Management, Peking University. During the early stages of his career, Max Yuan Hui worked at Microsoft China. In 2001, he resigned from Microsoft and founded Xiao-i, a cognitive intelligence company.\nMax Yuan Hui serves on multiple public roles including as the vice chairman of China's Artificial Intelligence Industry Innovation Alliance, the executive director of the China Computer Federation (ACF), the vice chairman of the Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Development Alliance, the vice chairman of the Shanghai AI Industry Association, and a member of the All-China Youth Federation and the Shanghai IT Youth Talent Association.\n\n\n== Personal patents ==\nMax Yuan Hui has five personal invention patents, including \"A Chatbot System,\" \"A Short Message Robot System,\"  \"An AI-based Knowledge Q&A Rapid Processing System,\"  and \"A Method and Device for Achieving Instant Messaging Among Multiple Members in an Instant Messaging Group.\" \n\n\n== Recent event attendances ==\nIn March 2023, Max Yuan Hui attended and spoke on the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference.\nIn June 2023, Max Yuan Hui attended and spoke on the 16th World Chinese Entrepreneurs Conference in Bangkok.\nIn November 2023, Max Yuan Hui attended and spoke on the Abu Dhabi Finance Week (ADFW) 2023.\nIn November 2023, Max Yuan Hui attended and spoke on the Fortune Global Forum 2023 in Abu Dhabi.\nIn March 2024, Max Yuan Hui attended and spoke on the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference. He said that China has been strong in the “application” of AI technologies but needs to double down on developing the “core and foundational” technology during an AI panel in the forum.\n\n\n== Patent case ==\nIn June 2012, as Xiao-i sued Apple Inc., Max Yuan Hui was involved into the eight-year-long patent invalidity litigation. The Xiao-i chatbot had been granted a patent in 2009 (Patent No.: ZL200410053749.9), described as a chat robot system that “can complete conversations in natural language,” and Max Yuan Hui believed that the features and technical path between the Xiao-i chatbot and Apple's Siri were consistent. After multiple rounds of appeals and trials, the Supreme People's Court Of the People's Republic of China made a final ruling in June 2020, upholding the validity of Xiao-i's patent.\nIn September 2021, Xiao-i demanded that Apple cease the sale of iPhone products that have allegedly infringed on Xiao-i's patent and claimed RMB 10 billion in compensation.\nAs of today, this dispute remains unresolved.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Robert D. Gregg is an American bioengineer, roboticist, inventor and academic. He is an associate professor at the University of Michigan.\nGregg is most known for his works on bipedal locomotion control and wearable robotics. His research focuses on integrating human biomechanics insights into robot control algorithms, improving natural movement efficiency. His work has targeted enhancing mobility for individuals with disabilities, particularly through robotic prosthetic legs mimicking natural gait patterns to reduce asymmetry. He has overseen clinical trials utilizing wearable robots for injury prevention in workplaces, elderly mobility enhancement, and restoring natural locomotion for above-knee amputees.\nHe is the recipient of the 2013 NIH Director's New Innovator Award and 2017 National Science Foundation CAREER Award.\n\n\n== Education ==\nGregg earned his Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences from the University of California in 2006, followed by a Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2007. He completed his Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the same university in 2010.\n\n\n== Career ==\nGregg began his academic career as a research scientist at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago from 2012 to 2013. He then joined the University of Texas at Dallas, serving as an assistant professor from 2013 to 2019 and concurrently as the Eugene McDermott Professor from 2018 to 2019. From 2020 to 2022, he was the associate director for graduate education in robotics at the University of Michigan, where he has been an associate professor since 2019.\n\n\n== Research ==\nFor his research, Gregg has received grants from organizations, including NIH and NSF. In his early research, he concentrated on the controlled reduction of bipedal walking robots. He introduced a hierarchical framework utilizing asymptotically stable gait primitives for motion planning in 3-D bipedal walking, reducing the problem to a low-dimensional discrete tree search and demonstrating its effectiveness in navigating obstacles with examples including the 3-D compass-gait biped and more complex models. As a result of his 2011 to 2013 research, he devised advanced biomimetic control strategies for powered prosthetic legs, emphasizing a kinematic constraint and output linearizing controller to enhance both wearability and performance. Furthermore, his control algorithm research has facilitated robotic prosthetic legs in replicating natural walking patterns, diminishing gait asymmetry in individuals with lower-limb amputations.\nGregg's recent research has focused on projects including phase-based control of prosthetic legs. This research has focused on enhancing the functionality of powered prosthetic legs for individuals with lower-limb amputations by developing a continuous parameterization method that synchronizes the prosthetic leg's motion with the user's activities and timing during the gait cycle, potentially leading to smoother and more natural mobility. In another research project, his group has focused on developing a novel control methodology for rehabilitation orthoses/exoskeletons based on task-invariant, energetic principles, allowing dynamic offloading of the weight of patients during gait rehabilitation. Some of his work has focused on developing compact, lightweight, wearable actuators for lower-limb orthoses and prostheses, utilizing custom high-torque motors with low-ratio transmissions to achieve high output torques with minimal back drive, promoting comfort, user participation, swing freedom, impact absorption, and energy regeneration during human locomotion.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2012 – Career Award at the Scientific Interface, Burroughs Wellcome Fund\n2013 – NIH Director's New Innovator Award, National Institutes of Health\n2017 – NSF CAREER Award, National Science Foundation\n\n\n== Selected articles ==\nGregg, R.

        "content": "Marjorie Gordon became Mrs E.K. Smart AM (20 May 1911 – 23 May 1982) was a British, Canadian and Australian diplomat and a founding college principal in Australia.\n\n\n== Life ==\nSmart was born in Winnipeg in 1911. Her father was known as the novelist Ralph Connor, but his real name was the Reverend Dr Charles Gordon. His day job was in the Presbyterian Church in Canada, which he would, in time, lead. Her mother was Helen (born King). Her elder brother was J. King Gordon, and she had five other sisters. Her parents had both been to university and she and all of her siblings graduated from the University of Manitoba.\nSmart became a civil servant and the secretary to Britain's High Commissioner Malcolm MacDonald until 1946. She then worked for Sir Gordon Munro who worked for the British Treasury. She converted to the Canadian diplomatic service in 1947 after the rules were changed and women were allowed to take the necessary exams. She was sent to work in New York where she was a Canadian vice-consul and a press officer for the Canadian delegation to the United Nations. She resigned that post when she became the second wife of the Australian consul-general, Edward Kenneth Smart DSO, in 1953.\nIn 1954 her husband retired and after they moved to Melbourne she began to help at the University of Melbourne. In 1961 her husband died and she worked for Australia's Department of Immigration. She made five trips to the UK. In 1963 she became an Australian citizen and in 1964 the University of Melbourne opened St Hilda's College in Melbourne with her as its first Principal. In 1965 she addressed  the Country Women's Association annual conference using the name \"Mrs E.K.Smart\". The Age newspaper reported that she said \"a woman's place is not in the home\".\nShe was made a Member of the Order of Australia for her work at the college.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nSmart died in 1982 in Winnipeg. In 2024, the 60th anniversary of the founding of Melbourne's St Hilda's College opened with the \"Marjorie Smart Oration\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiography at ADB",

        "content": "Horvat Eleq is located in the southeastern area of ​​Ramat HaNadiv, at the southern edge of Mount Carmel at an altitude of 141 meters above sea level. It is a multi-layered site with a prolonged and almost continuous human activity from the Middle Paleolithic period until the Byzantine period and then the Ottoman period. Horvat Eleq dominates the route of two historic roads - one extends from the Israeli coastal plain eastward along Nahal Taninim to the Jezreel Valley, and the other extends northward along the Israeli coastal plain and bypasses Mount Carmel to the north. Both roads were paved in the early Roman period as part of the imperial Roman road network. Nearby within 10 km are the cities of Dor, Caesarea and their ports, Tel Taninim and Tel Mevorakh to the west and Tel Burga to the southeast.\n\n\n== History ==\nHorvat Eleq has almost a continuous history of settlement starting at the Paleolithic period until the Ottoman period. Throughout history the settlement has benefited from its location next to an abundant and constant water source and overlooking two historical roads. Archaeological excavations at the site began in 1989 by Yizhar Hirschfeld and continued almost continuously until 2007. The main remains discovered and studied in the excavations are mainly associated with the end of the Persian period where the remains of a fortified wall are visible and the Hellenistic and Roman periods, as they are the major visible remains today. In the early Roman period, the site reaches its peak in terms of construction and settlement.After the First Jewish-Roman War the site was abandoned, although no layers of destruction were discovered, only a small number of sling stones and arrowheads were found, that cannot indicate a siege or a battle that took place there. In the late Ottoman period and the British mandate, there are remains of the village Am al-Elaq, which covers about two dunams at the top of the hill, including the mansion house known as 'Beit-Huri' to the north of it. After World War I Jewish  pioneers settled on lands purchased by JKA and Edmond James de Rothschild, but by 1923 the site was abandoned.\n\n\n== Archeology ==\nBetween the years 1989 and 2007, archaeological excavations were conducted continuously at the site. The findings at the site are mainly categorized to five time periods that begin at the end of the Persian period, from which the remains of a fortified wall can be seen, to the end of the Ottoman period, when a Jewish settlement was abandoned. The second layer discovered represents the early Hellenistic period to which are attributed the remains of a water pool next to the spring and about a dozen walls. To the north and south, architectural complexes from this period were uncovered and identified as part of a rural settlement. The small ceramic findings include local pottery and imported tools originating from the Aegean Sea and Greece, dating back to the days of the Ptolemaic and Seleucid Empire rule in the Land of Israel, the 2nd-3rd centuries B.C. The absence of coins from the Hasmonean period led to the assessment that the site was destroyed during the conquest of Alexander Jannaeus and remained in abandoned until the rule of Herod.The third layer represents the ancient Roman period identified by Hirschfeld as the site's peak. During the excavations, a perimeter wall was exposed along its entire length to the north, east and south. The wall was built of hewn dolomite stones and it was estimated that its height was about 8 m. The area of ​​the corner towers is about 5 square meters, excluding the south-eastern tower which its dimensions were 8 x 9 m. The length of the intermediate towers in the centers of the side walls were about 5 m. A passage exposed in the southern wall, about 3 m wide was called \"The water gate\", as it leads towards the spring. The findings in the agricultural area at the foot of the complex surrounded by the wall include – an oil press, columbarium, rock-cut pool, bathhouse, a spring and an aqueduct. These findings lead to the assessment that the complex was built in the days of King Herod 37- 4 BC and that several changes were made in 1st century CE, apparently in the days of Agrippa I 41-44 CE. The abandonment of the site was linked to the events of the First Jewish-Roman War 66-70 CE. The ceramic finds from this period include coins and pottery, some imported, glassware and various architectural items. \nIn the fourth layer, remains from the late Roman period and Byzantine period were identified mainly in the water facilities: the aqueduct, tunnels and the pools which continued to be used during these periods. In addition, two tombs from the Roman period were discovered on the edge of the site to the west. The main findings from these periods are a large hoard of coins which was discovered next to the spring and included over 2,100 coins from the 4th-7th centuries CE. These findings are consistent with the testimony of the traveler from Bordeaux from the first half of the 4th century about the spring of fertility that flows from Ain Sinai, about three miles from the city of Caesarea.The fifth layer, reveals remains from the late Ottoman period and British mandate that include the village of Am al-Eleq, which covers about two dunams at the top of the hill, and a mansion house known as 'Beit-Huri' to the north of it, which were built in the 19th century. After World War I Jewish pioneers settled on lands purchased by JKA and Edmond James de Rothschild, but by 1923 the site was abandoned.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Quercus blaoensis is the accepted name of a critically endangered oak tree species. It is estimated that there are fewer than 50 mature individuals. This species belongs the Asian sub-genus of Quercus within the family Fagaceae.  It differs from other Quercus subgenera in that they have acorns with distinctive cups, characterised by growing rings of scaly protrusions and densely grouped acorns (applies to this species but not to all).  This species is endemic to southeastern Vietnam where it inhabits evergreen seasonal tropical forests at altitudes of 200–1100 metres. It is named after 'Blao', the name used by the Chau Ma minority people for Bảo Lộc.\n\n\n== Description ==\nQuercus blaoensis is an evergreen tree that typically grows to a height of 15 metres. It is similar to Quercus langbianensis which some authors consider to be a species complex.  The leaves of Quercus blaoensis measure 80–120 × 28–35 mm and are lanceolate in shape, with an attenuate base and a pointed apex. In adulthood, the leaves are glabrous on both sides, having a smooth, green upper surface and a whitish, slightly waxy underside. The leaf margin is not wavy and is toothed for the apical third. The petiole measures 9–18 mm in length and is initially yellowish-pilose, becoming bare over time.\nThe catkins of the tree are 15 mm long and bear 2–3 flowers. The Acorns are ovate, 18 × 17 mm, and are densely hairy, with a depressed apex. The calyx, measuring 18–20 mm in diameter, covers two-thirds of the nut and typically features eight scaley rings.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Data related to Quercus at Wikispecies\n Media related to Quercus at Wikimedia Commons",

He served as the mayor of Cimahi, West Java between 2020 and 2022, mostly as acting mayor, after serving as the city's vice-mayor between 2017 and 2020.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nNgatiyana was born in Bantul Regency on 5 July 1961. After completing his studies at a technical school in Yogyakarta, he moved to Jakarta for work, and later moving to Bandung to work at Indonesian Aerospace. He resigned from his job to enroll in the Indonesian Army in 1983.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter completing basic training, Ngatiyana was deployed to East Timor where he served until 1988. He would return to East Timor between 1990 and 1992, before joining the Officer Candidate School. He then became the adjutant to Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan in Pandjaitan's various military and civilian postings, until 2001 when Pandjaitan ended his tenure as Minister of Industry and Trade. Ngatiyana held technical positions in the army infantry center and army training command until he retired in 2017 in order to run in that year's local elections. He held the rank of lieutenant colonel at the time of his retirement.\nIn 2017, Ngatiyana ran as a candidate for the vice-mayor of the city of Cimahi, West Java, with Ajay Muhammad Priatna as his running mate. The pair won 40.55% of the votes in the three-candidate race, defeating the incumbent mayor and another challenger. Ajay and Ngatiyana were sworn in on 22 October 2017. Following the arrest of Ajay by the Corruption Eradication Commission, Ngatiyana was appointed as acting mayor on 28 November 2020. On 16 August 2022, he was appointed as full mayor for the rest of his term, which expired on 22 October 2022. He was replaced by Dikdik Suratno Nugrahawan who became the new acting mayor.\nHe has declared his intention to run in the 2024 mayoral election.\n\n\n== Family ==\nNgatiyana married Midjiati Ningsih in 1988, and the couple has four children.\n\n\n== References ==",

He is a professor in the Department of Applied Physics at the Applied Science College of Kyung Hee University and serves as the Outside Director at KPT, the Representative CEO of V-memory, and the CTO of R-Materials in South Korea.\nRhyee's research spans across domains of  material science, encompassing magnetic and energy materials, crystal growth, thermoelectric materials, high thermal conductivity materials, magneto-caloric effect materials, unconventional properties of oxides and intermetallics, and superconductivity. He is the recipient of the 2009 Young Investigator Award by the International Thermoelectric Society and the 2018 IAAM Scientist Medal by the International Association of Advanced Materials.\nRhyee holds 19 Korean patents along with 32 international patents.\n\n\n== Education and early career ==\nRhyee obtained his Bachelor's in Physics from Chung-buk National University in 1998, and a Master's in Experimental Solid-State Physics from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) in 2000 under advisor Sung Ik Lee. He pursued a Ph.D. in Magnetic Materials at Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST) from 2000 to 2005, researching Hexaboride compounds under advisor Beong Ki Cho.\n\n\n== Career ==\nRhyee worked as a Postdoc Researcher in the Crystal Growth group at Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research in Germany from April 2006 to April 2007 and then served as an R&D Staff Researcher at the Materials Research Lab at Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT) from May 2007 to August 2010. He moved into academia as an assistant professor at the Department of Applied Physics of the Applied Science College at Kyung Hee University in South Korea in 2010, becoming associate professor in 2014 and Professor in 2019\nWhile in the role of associate professor, Rhyee concurrently held the position of department chair for the Department of Applied Physics from March 2017 to February 2019, and as the Vice Dean of the Applied Science College at Kyung Hee University from March 2018 to February 2019. He has been serving as the Outside Director at KPT since June 2022, as well as the CTO at R-Materials in South Korea since January 2023, and has also been acting as the Representative CEO of V-memory in South Korea since January 2020.\n\n\n== Research ==\nRhyee's research has focused on developing new materials in fields such as magnetic, superconductivity, and energy materials. He has investigated crystal growth in intermetallic and oxide compounds, studied thermoelectric materials for waste heat recovery and high thermal conductive materials for electronic applications. Additionally, his research has encompassed magneto-caloric effect materials for solid-state cooling, unconventional properties of oxides and intermetallics, and quasi-one-dimensional electronic transport. He has also explored soft magnetic materials, topological and Weyl semimetallic system, and superconductivity.\n\n\n=== Magnetism and thermoelectric research ===\nDuring his time at SAIT's Materials Research Center, Rhyee developed high-performance thermoelectric materials In4Se3-δ, published in Nature on 2009. This research proposed an approach to enhance ZT thermoelectric materials through Peierls distortion. He provided both experimental evidence and theoretical insights demonstrating that alloying SnTe with Ca significantly improved its transport properties, leading to a ZT of 1.35 at 873 K, the highest reported ZT value for singly doped SnTe materials. The study predicted approximately 10% efficiency for high-temperature thermoelectric power generation using SnTe-based materials, assuming a 400 K temperature difference. Furthermore, his work enhanced the thermoelectric properties of In4Se3–xCl0.03 bulk crystals through Ca alloying, and showed that intercalation of Cu nanoparticles between Te layers in Bi2Te3 transforms its native p-type character to n-type, reducing thermal conductivity and enhancing thermoelectric performance with a figure of merit (ZT) of 1.15 at approximately 300 K. His research also addressed the development of high-mobility transistors using CVD-grown MoSe2 films for applications like high-resolution displays.\nWithin his magnetism and thermoelectric research, Rhyee has explored unconventional magnetism in boride and intermetallic compounds, with a focus on magnetic polaronic transport and correlated properties. He examined the link between topological states and thermoelectricity, discovering that the topological phase transition in Dirac semimetals boosts thermoelectric performance. Further investigations revealed that selective charge Anderson localization is a novel avenue for enhancing thermoelectricity, yielding a  ZT value of 2.0 in n-type thermoelectric power generation. In a collaborative work, he presented a novel magnetic field-induced type II Weyl semimetallic state in the Shastry-Sutherland lattice, characterized by non-trivial Berry phase, magnetic field-induced Weyl nodes and spin chirality, chiral anomaly, anomalous magnetoconductivity, and demonstrated topological phase evolution.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2009 – Young Investigator Award, by International Thermoelectric Society\n2018 – IAAM Scientist Medal, International Association of Advanced Materials\n\n\n== Selected articles ==\nRhyee, J.

        "content": "Events in 1898 in animation.\n\n\n== Events ==\nNovember:  The German toy manufacturer Gebrüder Bing introduced their toy \"kinematograph\",  at a toy convention in Leipzig . In late 1898 and early 1899, other toy manufacturers in Germany and France, including Ernst Plank, Georges Carette, and Lapierre, started selling similar devices. The toy cinematographs were basically traditional toy magic lanterns, adapted with one or two small spools that used standard \"Edison perforation\" 35mm film, a crank, and a shutter. These projectors were intended for the same type of \"home entertainment\" toy market that most of the manufacturers already provided with praxinoscopes and magic lanterns. Apart from relatively expensive live-action films, the manufacturers produced many cheaper films by printing lithographed drawings. These animations were probably made in black-and-white from around 1898 or 1899. The pictures were often traced from live-action films (much like the later rotoscoping technique). These very short films typically depicted a simple repetitive action and most were designed to be projected as a loop - playing endlessly with the film ends put together. The lithograph process and the loop format follow the tradition that was set by the stroboscopic disc, zoetrope and praxinoscope.\n\n\n== Births ==\n\n\n=== January ===\nJanuary 2: Dick Huemer, American animator, comic strip artist, and illustrator (redesigned and developed Koko the Clown, created Fitz (Ko-Ko's canine companion), created Scrappy, storyboard artist for Dumbo), (d. 1979).\n\n\n=== May ===\nMay 1: Hazel Sewell, American animator, head  of the Ink and Paint Department at the Walt Disney Animation Studios (Plane Crazy,  Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.), (d. 1975).\nMay 11: Sam Slyfield, American sound engineer, (Walt Disney Animation Studios), (d. 1974).\n\n\n=== June ===\nJune 7: Earl Duvall, American animator, writer, lay-out artist, director and comics artist (Walt Disney Company, Warner Bros.

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The Second Brusilov offensive took place in July–August 1916 on the Eastern Front during the First World War. As a result of the First Brusilov offensive in May–June 1916, the Imperial Russian army defeated the Austro-Hungarian troops and captured a large number of prisoners (up to 50% of the soldiers of the Austro-Hungarian army were of Slavic origin and did not want to fight against the Russian Empire). But Imperial German army came to the aid of its ally. In July 1916, all Austro-Hungarian troops were subordinated to Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff and Hindenburg became commander-in-chief of the entire Eastern Front. The weakest sections of the Austro-Hungarian front were reinforced by German divisions, and most importantly, in the direction of the impending main attack of the Russian Southwestern Front (on Kovel), the defense was mainly occupied by German troops. The offensive in July–August, despite the use of enormous forces and resources by Brusilov (more than 1,000,000 soldiers), ended in failure. Three Russian armies (at least half a million soldiers) attacked German positions east of Kovel, but to no avail. \nThe colossal, unprecedented casualties for the Russian Imperial Army are indicated by the numbers of wounded on the Southwestern Front in July–August 1916 (during the second Brusilov offensive) - the maximum numbers for the entire war on Eastern Front, exceeding the Russian casualties during the Great Retreat of 1915 under the attacks of the German Imperial Army:\nJuly - 197,069 WIA\nAugust - 172,377 WIA.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn June 20, 1916, General of the cavalry Aleksei Brusilov subdued the arriving two fresh corps of the 8th Army and gave the order: the 3rd Army to capture Pinsk (this point was later canceled, since this army was part of the Western Front and had already been fighting for Pinsk since June 6), for the rest - “stop the general offensive and very firmly gain a foothold in the positions currently occupied, which are actively defended. Wherever possible, push forward the vanguards - cavalry to delay the advancing and pursue the retreating enemy,... just in case, prepare rear defensive positions\". In the next two days, he demanded that it be reinforced with two corps and that all rifle cartridges produced in the country be placed at his disposal, threatening to abandon further offensive. Mikhail Alekseyev notified Brusilov: “For now, all the rifle cartridges produced by our factories are sent to your disposal, which amounts to 4 million daily. There is nowhere else to get more. The reserves of the Northern and Western Front are small. It is necessary to require particularly careful collection of abandoned ammunition on the battlefield.” By a directive from the Alekseyev of June 23, the 3rd Army, as well as the 5th Army Corps and the 78th Infantry Division, were transferred to the Southwestern Front.\nPreparations for the new stage of the offensive were delayed due to ongoing attacks on the 8th Army. Now the Southwestern Front armies were supposed to facilitate the breakthrough of the Western Front armies to Baranovichi by attacking Kovel. The 9th Army continued its advance towards the Carpathians and reached the Prut River, but all attempts by Alekseyev to convince the headquarters of the Southwestern Front of the need to reinforce the troops of P. Lechitsky rested on a complete misunderstanding of the situation. Only on June 30 were the 117th Infantry Division from Crimea and the 108th Infantry and Ussuri Cossack Divisions from the Northern Front (25,000 soldiers) finally sent there. In addition, by this time the armies of the Southwestern Front had received about 50,000 marching reinforcements.\nTo deliver a new blow, the armies of the Southwestern Front (3rd, 8th, 11th, 7th and 9th) had more than 880,000 soldiers (55 infantry divisions, 2 separate infantry brigades, cavalry divisions – 20) with 3,187 machine guns and 2,637 guns against 536,500 soldiers and 2,972 guns of the Austro-Hungarian and German troops (41 infantry divisions, 6 separate infantry brigades, 12 cavalry divisions). The 3rd Army (infantry general L. Lesh) allocated two cavalry divisions to the reserve, the 8th infantry division, rifle and cavalry brigades, the 7th rifle division, and the 9th cavalry division. The 11th Army had no reserves.\nThe Central Powers, unlike the first stage of the operation (First Brusilov offensive), did not have the opportunity to allocate large forces to the reserve. On July 3, only the Southern Army and the  Army Group Alexander von Linsingen had reserves - an infantry division and a brigade of the Polish Legion, respectively. By this time, reinforcements had arrived from the German Eastern Front: the Bavarian Cavalry, 1st Reserve and 119th Infantry Divisions, 37th Infantry and 175th Landwehr Brigades (the latter deployed to the consolidated division of Lieutenant General H. von Clausius). The right flank of Linsingen (two infantry and cavalry divisions each) entered the army group of Prince Leopold of Bavaria, but due to the expansion of the front of the Russian 3rd Army, it also became involved in the battles for Polesie. To the north, the army group of Colonel General Remus von Woyrsch repelled the attack on Baranovichi by the 4th Army of the Russian Western Front. Near Kovel, new army groups of cavalry generals Friedrich von Bernhardi, Georg von der Marwitz and Eugen von Falkenhayn were created. In the Carpathians, a group of Lieutenant General R. von Kravel appeared as part of the 7th Army; command of the 4th Army was handed over to Colonel General K. Tershtyansky von Nadosh. Now E. von Falkenhayn assured the Austro-Hungarian command that with the help of the transferred German forces it was possible to prevent the Russians “from reaching a solution to the entire campaign, if only everyone in their place fulfills their duties”.\n\nBy July 4, the 3rd Army, which joined the Southwestern Front, consisted of the 31st and Combined Army Corps - a total of 4 infantry divisions and 4 cavalry divisions. Part of the forces was transferred to it from the neighboring 8th Army (infantry divisions - 2, cavalry divisions - 3). It was the 3rd and 8th armies (infantry divisions - 19, cavalry divisions - 10) that were involved in the battles for Kovel and Polesie; in many places they crossed the Stokhid River and established bridgeheads, but were unable to advance further.\nThe 9th Army (infantry divisions - 12, cavalry divisions - 4) crossed the Prut River and began advancing towards the main ridge of the Carpathians and the Hungarian administrative border. The two divisions that arrived in its composition could not have come at a better time, since the northern flank of the army was attacked by the German group of Kravel. On June 25, it was decided to send Lechitsky another 79th Infantry Division (14,000 soldiers) from the armies of the Russian Northern Front.\nHowever, on June 25, Brusilov, in a conversation with Alekseyev, once again emphasized that he considered his immediate task to be “the capture of Kovel by actions from the south, east and north, after which I will send part of the forces to the rear of the Pinsk enemy group, if by that time it does not withdraw itself \" The armies of the Western Front, in his opinion, will have to ensure this operation by occupying the Oginski Canal. Brusilov's opinion was supported by Emperor Nicholas II: “The main attack on Kovel, the front should take advantage of the reduction, apparently, of the enemy forces in the Pinsk region to push the enemy out of it, which would most fully achieve securing the right flank of the 3rd Army from the north and which would provide significant assistance operations of the Western Front\".\nAccording to Alekseyev's directive of July 9, 1916, the armies of the Southwestern Front were entrusted with the task of delivering the decisive blow to the campaign, and the neighboring Western Front was supposed to not only distract the forces of the German army, but also allocate new troops to be transferred to Brusilov's offensive zone. However, the armies of the Southwestern Front were too drained of blood to take immediate decisive action. By the end of June, their combat losses reached half a million men. The Austro-Hungarian troops, reinforced by German reinforcements, on the new lines of defense still did not allow a deep breakthrough to the rear. Moreover, the Brusilov breakthrough took completely different forms: conceived as a means to delay the forces of the Central Powers from the site of the proposed general offensive, it began to absorb the supplies and reserves of other fronts, including the shock Western Front. One of the reasons for the failure at Baranovichi offensive was that the armies of the Western Front transferred 16 infantry and 7 cavalry divisions to Brusilov, and the shortage in the infantry increased by 80,000 soldiers.\nOn June 28, the chief of staff of the Southwestern Front, Vladislav Klembovsky, gave a directive to attack Kovel from July 14, the next day he moved the date to July 16, and then Alekseyev allowed to wait for the arrival of all forces and sent the 3rd Army to reinforce Brusilov's armies. Therefore, only the 11th Army (200,000 soldiers, 895 machine guns, 613 guns, 18 bomb launchers and an armored train) was able to attack on July 16, which had the 45th Army Corps in reserve, which was almost immediately brought into battle. In the battle on the Styr and Lipa rivers, its troops (infantry divisions - 12, cavalry divisions - 3) pushed back the army group of G. von der Marwitz and the 1st Austro-Hungarian army (together about 85,000 soldiers, 500 machine guns, 400 guns and an armored train; infantry divisions - 8, cavalry divisions - 3), and then moved forward near Berestechko, capturing a total of up to 27,000 prisoners, 40 guns, 36 mortars and 49 machine guns and losing 30,000 men. The Germans, to the aid of their allies - the Austro-Hungarians, threw into battle an army reserve - the 108th German Infantry Division. On the evening of July 25, the headquarters of the 1st Austro-Hungarian Army was disbanded, and the remnants of the troops (10,000 men) were poured into the 2nd Army of Böhm-Ermolli.\nOn July 2, the army of Adjutant General V. Bezobrazov was formed from the guard troops, the armies of the Southwestern Front received the 3rd Army Corps (transportation began on July 5–6, 25,500 soldiers, 89 machine guns, 81 guns), 4th Siberian Corps (in the 3rd Army since July 8, 30,000 soldiers, 114 machine guns, 105 guns) and two heavy artillery divisions with a supply of shells - again from the Western Front. The actions of the 9th Army in Bukovina and the 11th Army in Eastern Galicia were of particular importance, but Brusilov saw in them only a cover for preparing the main attack on Kovel. The transition to the offensive here was scheduled for July 23, the completion of the entire operation in a week, but due to rains the attack was postponed. This made it possible to gather more powerful forces. On July 12, the transportation of the 1st Siberian Corps (29,000 soldiers, 98 machine guns, 81 guns) to the South-Western Front began, and 150,000 marching infantry reinforcements arrived. The 11th Army (infantry divisions - 12, cavalry divisions -3) on July 25 launched attacks near Brody on the group of Field Marshal-Lieutenant F. Kozak (43,000 men and 214 guns - consisting of Austro-Hungarian troops, staffed mainly by soldiers of Slavic nationalities) and defeated it in 4 days, capturing up to 14,000 prisoners, 40 machine guns and 9 guns. Russian losses amounted to about 17,000 men.\n\n\n== General offensive of the Russian Southwestern Front, July 28 - August ==\n\nOn the main direction, the offensive was postponed until July 28. This prolonged operational pause allowed Hindenburg and Ludendorff to gather significant reserves. In two weeks, the 34th and 106th (Landsturm) infantry divisions, the headquarters of the 1st and 8th Austro-Hungarian corps and the control of the 3rd Army from Tyrol arrived in the zone of the upcoming Russian offensive, subordinated together with the 7th Army to the newly created headquarters of the 12th Army of Field Marshal-Lieutenant Archduke Karl Franz Josef on July 4, the German 121st Infantry Division and the 2nd Jäger Brigade from France, the 10th Landwehr and 86th Infantry Divisions and the 9th Landsturm Brigade from Army Group Hindenburg. Some units were involved in the battles for Brody, the rest were used to create reserves. In the army group of Archduke Charles (infantry divisions - 22, cavalry divisions-5), the Carpathian Corps (7th Army), an infantry division (3rd Army) and three regiments of the German Landsturm (Southern Army) were allocated to the reserve. The Army Group's reserve included a German infantry brigade. The 2nd Army (infantry divisions - 5, cavalry brigade - 1), leading stubborn battles near Brody, had a cavalry brigade in reserve. In the Linsingen army group (infantry divisions - 27, cavalry divisions - 5), reserves were created in the von der Marwitz army group (infantry division), in the 4th Army (Landwehr brigade), in the Bernardi army group ( division and two infantry brigades), as well as two infantry divisions directly at the disposal of Linsingen.\nUnlike the Central Powers, the Russian armies had practically no reserves for developing an offensive. Platon Lechitsky was able to allocate only one infantry division to the reserve of the 9th Army (infantry divisions - 13, cavalry divisions - 5), in the 7th and 11th armies (together infantry divisions - 24, cavalry divisions - 5) there were no reserves was completely, Alexey Kaledin (8th Army - infantry divisions - 8, cavalry divisions - 3) and Bezobrazov (infantry divisions - 10, cavalry divisions - 3) left only cavalry in reserve - one and three divisions, respectively, Leonid Lesh (3rd Army - infantry divisions - 15, cavalry divisions - 7) intended to use the 1st Siberian Corps (two rifle divisions) that had not yet arrived to develop success.\nIn total, on July 28, 1916, the armies of the Russian Southwestern Front had 933,236 combat troops with 4,158 machine guns, 3,224 guns, 2 armored trains, as well as another 47,000 unarmed and 54,500 marching replenishment and reserves (infantry divisions - 60, cavalry divisions – 23). The Central Powers (12th and 2nd Austro-Hungarian armies, with the 3rd, 7th and Southern Armies subordinated first; Linsingen Army Group) had 580,040 combat troops bayonets and sabers, 3,096 machine guns, 3,446 guns and 8 armored trains (infantry divisions - 49,  cavalry divisions – 10). As at the beginning of the offensive of the Southwestern Front, Russian superiority in manpower was compensated by a large number of artillery and stronger reserves of the Central Powers. In addition, this time there were more German rather than Austro-Hungarian troops in reserve.\nIn the Kovel direction, three Russian armies went on the offensive, superior to the Germans in both manpower and artillery. However, the attacks by the enormous 3rd Army (infantry divisions - 15, cavalry divisions - 7; 300,000 men) against the German groups of Leopold Freiherr von Hauer, Fat and Gronau (infantry - 7, cavalry divisions - 6) were repulsed. More successful were the actions of the army of V. M. Bezobrazov (infantry divisions - 10, cavalry divisions - 3), whose corps were pushed aside by the German groups Friedrich von Bernhardi and Walther von Lüttwitz (infantry divisions - 8) on Stokhod River. Already on the first day, the Central Powers brought army reserves into battle, and by August 1 - all the reserves of Linsingen's army group. An even more difficult test fell on the 4th Austro-Hungarian Army (infantry divisions - 5,  cavalry division - 1). The Russian 8th Army (infantry divisions - 8, cavalry divisions - 3) was unable to support the offensive of the Russian Imperial Guard, but it broke through the front of the Austrian 4th Army in the direction of Vladimir-Volynsky. Linsingen was dissatisfied with the low resistance of the Ruthenian regiments, especially since he considered the attack of the 8th Army a diversionary maneuver, and demanded that the 11th Division be removed to another front as completely unreliable. On the first day, troops of the 9th Army (infantry divisions - 13, cavalry divisions - 5) broke through the Central Power's defenses at the junction of the Southern and 3rd armies (together infantry divisions - 20, cavalry divisions - 3) along the southern bank of the Dniester River. But Lechitsky was again left without reinforcements and feared for the weak, extended flank in Bukovina: already on July 30 he was forced to stop the offensive.\nThe new phase of the Southwestern Front offensive coincided with the meeting in Pless of the Emperors of Germany and Austria-Hungary. July 29 the decision was approved to subordinate all troops from the Baltic to Galicia, including the 2nd Austro-Hungarian Army, to Hindenburg. On July 30, the army group of artillery general Hans von Gronau was subordinated to the army group of Prince Leopold of Bavaria and reinforced by the 1st Landwehr Division. On August 3, Hindenburg took command of the Eastern Front and ordered to strengthen the defense of Kovel with the 75th Infantry Division and the 15th Turkish Corps. The front of the 4th Army was supposed to strengthen the regiment from the army of R. von Woyrsch, which successfully defended Baranovichi, and the headquarters of the 40th Army Corps, led by Infantry General K. Litzman. In just a short time, 456 trains with troops arrived at the front: the Carpathians were supposed to cover the 1st Infantry Division and the Alpine Corps. Infantry General E. von Falkenhayn, did not participate in the meeting due to illness, which was most likely of a diplomatic nature. He still feared for the front of the 2nd Army in Galicia and ordered the German 195th and 197th infantry divisions, newly formed in Poland, to be sent there. Hindenburg was forced to allocate the 3rd Landwehr Brigade from the German 8th Army (Courland) for the same purpose. In early August, Hindenburg and Ludendorff planned to strike Russian troops in Bukovina.\n\nThe army headquarters of the Southwestern Front was preparing new attacks. The 1st Siberian Corps, which arrived in the 3rd Army, replaced the 4th Siberian Corps, which suffered heavy losses and was withdrawn to the rear. From August 6, the latter was personally subordinated to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, Emperor Nicholas 2, as the last reserve for developing the offensive. In general, Alekseyev was not satisfied with the progress of the battles near Kovel and in other areas. He telegraphed on July 20 to Klembovsky: \"The reinforcements brought by the Germans, which managed to gain a fairly strong foothold in accidentally occupied positions, no longer make it possible to develop operations simultaneously with all armies on a wide front and require, in my opinion, the concentration of superior forces in some selected important areas. In general, the southwestern armies have on their side a superiority of forces of over 200,000 soldiers, which makes it possible to combine a strike, make a breakthrough and follow it up with work on the enemy’s flank and rear, avoiding costly exclusively frontal attacks, for the development of which there are no longer the means. According to this program of lack of concentration of forces, the 3rd Army led the attack, General Bezobrazov imitated it, the result was a state of powerlessness with a general superiority of forces. Again I turn to the Seventh Army, which, for the benefit of the cause, could now allocate a corps to the Ninth Army, with the help of which the victory of July 15 would receive widespread development and decisive significance. Work without gathering forces leads to slow development of the operation, loss of time, strengthening of enemy positions, large expenditure of shells and people... It is necessary to lay hands on the forces and means of one army to temporarily strengthen another and gather overwhelming forces in the intended direction\".\nAlekseyev's opinion was confirmed by the experience of the July battles: alone, the 11th Army achieved greater success than all the armies of the Southwestern Front while simultaneously striking the enemy. Nevertheless, on August 5, the Russians struck a new general blow. The 11th Army was the first to act again (infantry divisions - 12, cavalry divisions -3), attacking the right flank of the Austro-Hungarian army E. von Böhm-Ermolli (infantry divisions - 5,  cavalry divisions - 1). The fighting lasted 10 days and was characterized by extreme tension. The Central Powers brought into battle the 34th Landwehr Brigade, the commander of the 11th cavalry general, V. Sakharov, the 32nd Army Corps and the 5th Siberian Corps, transferring them from the safer northern flank. Then Böhm-Ermolli carried out the same castling, but only two German divisions of Infantry General J. von Eben, who arrived from Lemberg and Kovel, were able to stop the further advance of the Russian troops.\nOn August 7, the huge 9th Army of P. A. Lechitsky (infantry - 14, cavalry divisions - 5, 300,000 men) launched an offensive against Stanislavuv and Galich. The task was complicated by the fact that in the Carpathians, from August 2, against the left flank of the Austo-Hungarian army, the Austo-Hungarians went on the offensive with the forces of the fresh Carpathian Corps and pushed the Russian vanguards away from the mountain passes (Kirlibaba, Mygura, Yablunice). It was there that the reserve had to be sent - the 79th Division, which was preparing to support the breakthrough on the Dniester River. In the attack direction, Lechitsky concentrated about 100 thousand soldiers and up to 500 guns against 78,000 soldiers and 490 guns of the 3rd Army of the Infantry General H. Köves von Köwesshaza (infantry divisions - 9, cavalry divisions - 2)71. The front was broken through at Tlumach, and within 4 days Russian troops reached the Bystrytsia of Solotvyn River and took Stanisławów, 19,650 prisoners, 18 guns and 157 machine guns.\nThe commander of Army 7, Infantry General D. Shcherbachev, took advantage of his neighbor's success. At the strike line, he had an equal number of guns with the Austo-Hungarian army, and outnumbered him almost four times in manpower (the right flank of the Southern Army), but did not dare to attack until the breakthrough of the 9th Army forced the commander of the Southern Army, Colonel General Count F. von Botmer to bend his flank along the northern bank of the Dniester. On August 10, Shcherbachev (infantry divisions - 10, cavalry divisions - 2) brought the reserve into battle - the 22nd Army Corps, creating a five-fold superiority in infantry and gaining superiority in artillery. Throwing two reserve regiments into battle, Bothmer stopped the advance of the Russian troops, but was forced to retreat to Zborow, Brzezany and Galich, since both of his flanks were covered by the 11th and 9th armies. To the latter, to develop the offensive, Shcherbachev transferred two infantry divisions, which had a significant impact on the development of the breakthrough on the Dniester. In total, the troops of the 7th Army took 8,581 prisoners, 4 guns and 19 machine guns73. The position of Archduke Charles' army group was becoming critical. The 2nd cavalry and 48th reserve German divisions and the 15th Turkish corps (two infantry divisions), which had already assembled in Kovel, were sent to the Southern Army. On August 9, it was decided to send to the 3rd Army the 2nd Scooter Brigade from Silesia and the 103rd Reserve Brigade from France (they made up the 199th Division), as well as those withdrawn from the Battle of the Somme to replenish the 10th Bavarian and 117th Infantry Division. On August 14, the headquarters of the army group of Infantry General F. von Gerock arrived in Kalushch. These measures not only strengthened the enemy's positions north of the Dniester, but also allowed the Austro-Hungarian command to withdraw three divisions from this section of the front - one to the Italian theater of operations and two to create a barrier against Romania.\nIn the Kovel direction, the 3rd Army brought the fresh 1st Siberian Corps into battle, but to no avail. The attacks of the armies of Bezobrazov and Kaledin were also unsuccessful. The positions around Kovel were occupied by German divisions, which were much more combat-ready than the Austro-Hungarian ones. For the first time during the fighting of the 1916 campaign, the Central Powers were able not only to repel all attacks and inflict huge losses on the Russian troops, but even to restore previously lost positions. In the German Army Group of Linsingen, a new method of creating tactical reserves began to be practiced: the most prepared regiments and battalions were selected from divisions, which were concentrated at key points behind the front line and brought into battle when there was a threat of a breakthrough of positions. This made it possible to use only four regiments out of three divisions of the army and front reserve.\n\n\n== Casualties and losses ==\nIn total, the Second Brusilov offensive cost the armies of the Southwestern Front 312,000 men. During the same period, 51,000 men returned from hospitals and 136,500 arrived as marching reinforcements.  The total losses of the Central Powers (taking into account the damage of troops operating against the armies of the Russian Northern and Western Fronts) since the beginning of the Brusilov offensive in May 1916 exceeded 483,000 men, the Russian armies of the Southwestern Front - 810,000 men, the armies of the North and Western Fronts - reached 480,000 men.\n\n\n== Outcome ==\nThe results of the Second Brusilov offensive forced Alekseyev to have a different attitude towards the prospect of Romania acting on the side of the Entente. Success on the Dniester River could pose a threat to Hungary and Transylvania. If in winter Alekseyev rejected the project of the Supreme Council of the Entente to conduct an offensive operation specifically in the direction of the Carpathians and Romania, then on August 5 Alekseyev gave a directive to strengthen troops on the Deliatyn – Câmpulung front: “Romania’s attack against Austria can take place subject to the allied armies attacking Thessaloniki and maintaining not only a strong, stable position in Bukovina, but also the ability to go on the offensive. If Romania’s performance does not follow, a strong left wing is necessary to support the entire operation of the Southwestern Front.”\nHowever, Brusilov was still more concerned with the capture of Kovel. On July 28, he asked to transfer the 4th Siberian Corps to him again: “I believe that achieving a major success here is necessary and certainly possible, provided that the Western and Northern Fronts do not allow further transfer of enemy troops to Kovel”. Here Brusilov was wrong: Hindenburg did not use forces from the army groups of Prince Leopold and Field Marshal E. von Eichhorn to repel attacks on Kovel. Using Brusilov's arguments about the desirability of attacking Kovel from the north, Alekseyev on July 30 issued a directive to transfer the armies of Bezobrazov and Lesh to the Northern Front for “energetic replenishment and a decisive attack on the enemy covering Kovel.” Three rifle divisions were transferred to Brusilov. He now had to “develop as widely as possible the success achieved by the 11th, 7th and 9th armies, complete the disorder of the Austrian armies and, if possible, separate the Austro-German troops operating on the Brody-Cârlibaba front from the main mass of the Germans concentrated on Kovel and Vladimir-Volynsk directions\". The front of Brusilov's troops was now significantly reduced. For the first time since the beginning of his offensive, he did not receive, but gave troops (albeit, along with their line of responsibility) - 20 infantry and 8 cavalry divisions (more than 220,000 soldiers and 955 guns). They were opposed by 18 infantry and 8 cavalry divisions with significant artillery forces.\nTo develop the operation, the Southwestern Front received 24 infantry and 5 cavalry divisions as reinforcements and reserves, and together with the front sector, another 4 infantry and 4 cavalry divisions (3rd Army in June), in addition, 246,000 marching reinforcements arrived and 117,000 recovered from hospitals. The operation, which was initially of an auxiliary nature, already in the first month absorbed all strategic reserves of Imperial Russian Army and made it impossible for other fronts to conduct successful operations. Only one goal set by the April directive was achieved: the Central Powers were ousted from the fortified line that they occupied before the start of the offensive. There was no significant outflow of German troops from positions in front of the armies of the Russian Northern and Western fronts.\nThe Austro-Hungarian and German high command was seriously concerned about the situation on the Eastern (German) and Northern (Austro-Hungarian) fronts. At a meeting in Pless, German Emperor Wilhelm II declared to Emperor Franz Joseph: “The situation in the East seems to me so serious that it is necessary to discuss appropriate measures, to which I will then ask your consent.” The role of direct assistance by troops to the Northern Front of Austria-Hungary was especially emphasized by the then Chief of Staff of the Eastern Front E. Ludendorff: “Austria-Hungary fed on German blood and German material resources”. Until August 14, the Central Powers transferred 30 infantry and 3 cavalry divisions to the front south of Pripyat, two more infantry and two cavalry divisions took part in repelling the Brusilov breakthrough in connection with the expansion of the range of the armies of the Russian Southwestern Front. In addition, 260 thousand marching reinforcements and more than 180 thousand recovered from field hospitals and rear hospitals arrived in the troops. 5 infantry divisions departed from Archduke Charles' Army Group: one to Lithuania, one to Italy and three to Transylvania.\nThe transfer of new formations was facilitated by the fact that at this time the German divisions were switching from a brigade to a regimental structure. Thus, several transferred brigades were immediately deployed into new divisions, and some of them remained in the same place, which misled Russian intelligence. Not a single division was withdrawn from the front of the supposed initial Russian offensive (Smarhon – Krevo) until August. After repelling the attack on Baranovichi, the army group of Infantry General R. von Woyrsch gave only one division to its southern neighbors. In just two months, from the Germany troops opposing the armies of the Russian Northern Front, 4 infantry and 2 cavalry divisions were sent to Volyn, Galicia and the Carpathians, while Evert transferred 20 infantry and 8 cavalry divisions to Brusilov. From the German armies operating against the troops of the Russian Northern Front, 6 infantry divisions and one cavalry division were sent to repel Brusilov's offensive. Kuropatkin also transferred 6 infantry and 1 cavalry divisions to the Southwestern Front. If we take into account that the Central Powers during the same time reinforced the troops of the army group of Prince Leopold and Hindenburg with three infantry divisions (including one Austro-Hungarian from Galicia), it turned out that the offensive of Brusilov's armies diverted more Russian formations than enemy formations from the front expected general offensive. True, the Central Powers was forced to throw into battle 4 strategic reserve divisions in the East, a division from the Balkan Front (Army Group of Field Marshal August von Mackensen), 7 German divisions from France, 6 Austro-Hungarian divisions from the Italian theater of operations and 2 Turkish divisions from Bosphorus. But the weakening of the Quadruple Alliance forces in these theaters was of little consequence, except on the Italian front, where the Austro-Hungarian forces were driven back into South Tyrol and lost Gorizia.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Milan Švabić (Serbian Cyrillic: Милан Швабић; born 1951) is a Serbian politician, administrator, and entrepreneur. He is a former mayor of Aranđelovac and has served in the assemblies of Serbia and Yugoslavia. Švabić is now a member of the Aranđelovac municipal assembly, serving as an independent delegate aligned with Dveri.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nŠvabić was born in the village of Vrbica near Aranđelovac, in what was then the People's Republic of Serbia in the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. He was raised in his home community and graduated from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Economics in 1976. Švabić worked for a local branch of Jugobanka until 1982, when he began working for the company Šamot.\n\n\n== Politician ==\n\n\n=== Mayor and parliamentarian (1989–1993) ===\nŠvabić was elected as mayor of Aranđelovac in the 1989 Serbian local elections. He was later elected to the National Assembly of Serbia for Aranđelovac in the 1990 Serbian parliamentary election as a candidate of the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS). The SPS won a majority victory in 1990, and he initially served as a supporter of the administration. In March 1991, he was chosen as one of the Serbian parliament's twelve delegates to the Chamber of Republics in the assembly of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY). His term in the latter office ended in April 1992, when the SFRY ceased to exist.\nŠvabić was one of four parliamentarians who left the SPS assembly group on 1 July 1992, dissatisfied with the party's policies. He later helped to form a breakaway group called the Social Democratic Party of Serbia.\nThe 1990 Serbian parliamentary election was the last to be conducted in single-member constituency seats; all subsequent elections have been held under proportional representation. Švabić was not a candidate in the 1992 Serbian parliamentary election and his term ended when the new assembly convened in early 1993. His term as mayor of Aranđelovac presumably ended in mid-1992 or early 1993.\nŠvabić appeared in the second position on the electoral list of Vuk Obradović's Social Democracy (SD) party for the Kragujevac division in the 1997 parliamentary election. The list did not win any seats.\n\n\n=== Out of politics ===\nThe SPS dominated Serbian politics until the fall of Slobodan Milošević in October 2000. During this period, after leaving office, Švabić worked in education and operated a private business at his family's farm. He became director of the company Venčac in 2001 and later worked in a leadership role at ED Aranđelovac.\n\n\n=== Local politics in Aranđelovac (2014–present) ===\nŠvabić appeared in the seventh position on the electoral list of the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) in Aranđelovac for the 2014 local elections and was elected when the list won a majority victory with twenty-seven out of forty-one seats. He served for the term that followed and was not a candidate for re-election in 2018.\nHe later joined the party Healthy Serbia (ZS). In the 2022 local elections, he appeared in the lead position on a coalition ZS–Dveri list in Aranđelovac and was elected when the list won three seats. The SNS won the election, and Švabić served in opposition.\nHealthy Serbia joined the SNS's political coalition in late 2023. In November 2023, Švabić resigned from the party and said that he would continue to work with Dveri in the local assembly as an independent member.\n\n\n== Electoral record ==\n\n\n=== National Assembly of Serbia ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Swainsona oliveri is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae and is endemic to south-western Australia. It is a slender, prostrate to ascending annual or perennial herb with imparipinnate leaves with 9 to 13 narrowly egg-shaped leaflets, the narrower end towards the base, and racemes of up to 4 cream-coloured to yellow flowers, sometimes with a pink tinge.\n\n\n== Description ==\nSwainsona oliveri is a slender prostrate to ascending annual or perennial herb, that typically grows to a height of about 2–15 cm (0.79–5.91 in) and has radiating stems. The leaves are imparipinnate, mostly 150–350 mm (5.9–13.8 in) long with 9 to 13 egg-shaped leaflets with the narrower end towards the base, the side leaflets 1–7 mm (0.039–0.276 in) long and 1–3 mm (0.039–0.118 in) wide with stipules 1–2 mm (0.039–0.079 in) long at the base of the petioles. The flowers are cream-coloured to yellow, sometimes tinged with pink, arranged in racemes of up to 4 on a peduncle up to 40 mm (1.6 in) long. The sepals are joined at the base to form a tube about 3 mm (0.12 in) long, with lobes shorter than the tube. The standard petal is 3.5–6 mm (0.14–0.24 in) long and 3–5 mm (0.12–0.20 in) wide, the wings 3–6 mm (0.12–0.24 in) long and the keel about 4–6 mm (0.16–0.24 in) long and 1–2 mm (0.039–0.079 in) deep.  Flowering occurs from August to September, and the fruit is a narrowly elliptical pod 10–25 mm (0.39–0.98 in) long and 3.5–4 mm (0.14–0.16 in) wide with the remains of the style 1.0–1.25 mm (0.039–0.049 in) long.\n\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\nSwainsona oliveri was first formally described in 1882 by Ferdinand von Mueller in Southern Science Record from a specimens collected near Port Eucla by John Oliver. The specific epithet (oliveri) honours the collector of the type specimens.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThis species of swainsona grows on sandy plains and is widespread in South Australia and in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Great Victoria Desert, Hampton, Murchison and Nullarbor bioregions of Western Australia. It also occurs in the far western plains of New South Wales and the south of the Northern Territory.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was republished in Mind in English in 1956. In it, Frege argues against idealism and for platonism about thoughts, or propositions. Frege says ideas are private, but thoughts are public. Frege said that such abstract objects were members of a third realm. Frege also argued for a redundancy theory of truth.\nQuoting Frege, \"The thought, in itself immaterial, clothes itself in the material garment of a sentence and thereby becomes comprehensible to us. We say a sentence expresses a thought.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Thought",

        "content": "\n== Battles ==\nThe Guhilas were feudatories of the Moriyas of Chitor and they came into prominence in the time of Khummaņa I popularly known as Bappā Rāwal who was the 9th ruler in the family of Guhadatta. He started his political career as a vassal of the Mori monarch Manurāja and probably led the Mori forces against the Arabs. In this expedition, Bappā Rāwal achieved complete victory. This grand success raised his prestige and popularity so much so that he even overshadowed his overlord. And finding a favourable opportunity, he either deposed the Mori monarch and captured the fortress of Chitor; or the Mori ruler died childless and his throne peacefully passed on to his favourite feudatory Bappa Rawal. The date of Bappa's acces- sion is placed between 728 and 740 A.D. The Arab invasion referred to in the above grant probably took place in his reign. We may accept Mr. Vaidya’s suggestion that Bappa was a samanta (vassal) of that King. It is not unlikely that Bappa was the leader of the Mori forces opposed to the Arabs, and he distinguished himself by a victory. This exploit may have given him an important position in the court of the Mori prince. Abul Fazl remarks that “his daring was so conspicuous that he became in favour with the Raja and a trusted minister of State”\n\n\n== References ==\n\nKhalid Yahya Blankinship (1994).

        "content": "No Rancho Fundo is a Brazilian telenovela created by Mário Teixeira. It premiered on TV Globo on 15 April 2024. The telenovela is loosely inspired by the play A Capital Federal, written by Artur Azevedo. It stars Larissa Bocchino, Túlio Starling, Andréa Beltrão, Alexandre Nero, José Loreto, Luisa Arraes, Débora Bloch and Eduardo Moscovis.\nIn spite of being seen as a direct continuation of Mar do Sertão, the telenovela is officially presented as a kind of epilogue to the aforementioned story, since the main plot takes place shortly after the death of the character Tertulinho (Renato Góes), in addition to the absence of the other main characters from Mar do Sertão. However, several characters were brought back by Teixeira.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n=== Main ===\nLarissa Bocchino as Maria Quirina Belmont Leonel \"Quinota\"\nTúlio Starling as Artur Ariosto\nAndréa Beltrão as Josefa \"Zefa\" Belmont Leonel\nAlexandre Nero as Eurico \"Tico\" Leonel Limoeiro\nJosé Loreto as Marcelo Gouveia\nLuisa Arraes as Blandina Rivera\nDébora Bloch as Deodora Montijo / Deodora Limeira Aguiar\nEduardo Moscovis as Quintino Ariosto Evaristo\nAlejandro Claveaux as Jordão Nicácio\nMariana Lima as Salete Maria Pietrelcina da Consolação\nClara Moneke as Caridade do Coração Eucarístico de Jesus\nWelder Rodrigues as [[Mar do Sertão|Prefeito Sebastião Bodó Vindouro Menezes \"Sabá Bodó\"\nTitina Medeiros as Nivalda Menezes\nThardelly Lima as Vespertino Limoeiro\nIgor Jansen as Aldenor Belmont Leonel\nGuthierry Sotero as Anastácio \"Nastácio\" Belmont Leonel\nHeloísa Honein as Maria Margarida \"Margaridinha\" Belmont Leonel\nDandara Queiroz as Benvinda Belmont Leonel\nIgor Fortunato as José Albertino \"Zé Beltino\" Belmont Leonel\nRhaisa Batista as Fé do Coração Eucarístico de Jesus\nAndréa Bak as Esperança do Coração Eucarístico de Jesus\nHaroldo Guimarães as Cícero Eucarístico de Jesus\nNina Tomsic as Dracena Muribel de Blumenau\nSuzy Lopes as Cira Aparecida de Gênova\nLeandro Daniel as Floro Borromeu\nJu Colombo as Quintilha das Chagas\nTomás de França as José Carlos Belmont Leonel \"Juquinha\"\nNatascha Falcão as Lola\nRafael Saraiva as Guilherme\nNanego Lira as Padre Zezo Gusmão / Monsenhor José de Botas\nValdineia Soriano as Manuela Ariosto\nFatima Patricio as Castorina Rivera\nAna Maria Mangeth as Escolástica\nJorge Ritchie as Torquato Tasso\nRenan Motta as Marconi\nEvaldo Macarrão as Antonio Bello\nLukete as Palmito Repentista\nJuzé as Totonho Repentista\n\n\n=== Guest stars ===\nEnrique Díaz as Francisco Itamar Miroel Timbó\n\n\n== Ratings ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNo Rancho Fundo at IMDb",

        "content": "The Effects of phosphate mining in Nauru has had a significant negative impacts on the island's environment and economy. One of the most prominent effects of the phosphate mining in Nauru is the extensive environmental degradation that has occurred as a result of the extraction of phosphates. Large areas of the island have been stripped of vegetation and topsoil, leaving behind barren landscapes that are prone to erosion and degradation. The mining activities have also caused significant disruption to the island's ecosystem, leading to a decline in biodiversity and the extinction of several plant and animal species.\nThe mining in Nauru has also had profound social and health consequences for the country. The reliance on phosphate mining as the main source of income has made Nauru extremely vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices, leading to economic instability and uncertainty. The depletion of the phosphate deposits has also left the country with limited options for sustainable economic development, as the once fertile land is now unusable for agriculture or other purposes. This has resulted in high levels of unemployment and poverty among the population, further exacerbating social issues such as crime and substance abuse.\n\n\n== Environmental issues ==\nSince the early 1900s, Nauru has been mined for phosphorus by many countries, resulting in devastating destruction of the land. As much as 80% of the island is unusable due to phosphorus mining, which has left exposed coral pinnacles that leave the land useless and uninhabitable.The degradation of the land has resulted in a \"lower resilience of the natural environment,\" causing many negative health and environmental effects, like poor water quality, greater erosion rates, poor precipitation, higher droughts, and greater CO2 emissions. The damage done through mining extends further by ocean acidification and coastal erosion, these have threatened the terrestrial and marine biodiversity. The people of Nauru also face continued negative health effects from the mining in the form of phosphate dust pollution and cadmium pollution, tainting the water and air quality. As a result, the rate of care-seeking for children under 5 years of age with ARI is 69% according to UNICEF data. Due to the extent of the mining, there is not much that can be done now to alleviate the agricultural problems that Nauruans face besides monetary reparations, which Nauru pursued from the Australian Government in 1989, through the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, The lawsuit was settled in 1993 in an out-of-court payout of $120 million AUD over 20 years.\nPhosphate mining has removed most of the vegetation and tree coverage that Nauru had, leaving the land and the people vulnerable to intense heat on an island so close to the Equator. The effects of the vegetation removal has been most felt by refugees in the Nauru detention center, which is in the very centre of the island where the majority of the mining is done. Along the coast, where most Nauruans are forced to live now due to the land reduction caused by mining, the coastal plants that remain are vital for the \"provision of shade and animal and plant habitats; protection from wind, erosion, flood, and salt water incursion; land stabilization; protection from the desiccating effects of salt spray; and soil improvement and mulching,\" especially as the coast is expected to continue eroding with the increasing effects of climate change.\n\n\n== Social effects ==\nBecause phosphate mining, and now deep-sea mining, has been going on for so long, it is hard to parse out exactly how it has affected the Nauruan people. Researchers have offered that the Nauruan people likely have a loss of their sense of place and culture, as they did not have full control of their land until 1968. There has also been a documented loss of Nauruan traditions like subsistence farming as well as the violations of their rights to their own land and the continued human rights violations that continue at the Nauru detention centre. The Nauruan people face extremely high rates of obesity, alcoholism, prostitution, poorer mental health rates, and myriad other health issues that stem from these problems. A study done in 2014 by The Nauru Family Health and Support Study implemented by Nauru Department of Home Affairs and DFAT and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) have shown an alarming prevalence of violence in romantic relationships on the island, with 48.1% of ever-partnered women who participated saying they have experienced physical or sexual violence at least once. A quarter of women in the same study have experienced violence in at least one pregnancy, and 9.9% of women had experienced some form of violence in the past 12 months. In another study surveying sexual health, 21% of a portion of the population tested positive for chlamydia.. In the same survey, 30% of school children aged 13–15 reported having attempted suicide, and 24% of children under the age of five are stunted. Though Nauruans are currently still searching for a way to stay on the island and live viable lives, some speculate that the only way for them to do so is to continue mining the phosphorus that is left (30 years or so).\n\n\n== See also ==\nPhosphate mining in Banaba and Nauru\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "This is a table of the most widespread or notable anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems intended in whole or part to counter ballistic missiles. Since many systems have developed in stages or have many iterations or upgrades, only the most notable versions are described. Such systems are typically highly integrated with radar and guidance systems, so the emphasis is chiefly on system capability rather than the specific missile employed. For example, David's Sling is a system that employs the Stunner missile.\nLegend for ABM system status in below table:\n  Operational   Under development   Inactive   Unknown status\n\n\n== See also ==\nMissile defense systems by country\nAnti-ballistic missile defense countermeasure\n\n\n== Notes ==\nSystem name: Many systems have numerous iterations or block upgrades, or have had multiple names. The primary or current system in use is described and noted, with the specific weapon iteration noted as appropriate.\nPeriod of use: ABM systems have protracted development periods. The time the system is or was in operational use is described.\nIntercept: Most systems can be used in different phases of ballistic missile flight, i.e., boost (where surface or air-launched anti-aircraft missiles might also be effective because the ballistic missile is moving relatively slowly at at low altitude), requiring proximity to the launch site and immediate response, mid-course/exo-atmospheric, and re-entry/terminal. The principal intended phase of ballistic missile interception is noted. Other phases may be tried, with less effect. The earlier in flight that a missile is intercepted, the greater area a system may defend. Terminal defense usually protects a relatively small area (i.e., Moscow, Minot Air Force Base missile fields) from projectiles in the re-entry phase.\nRole: Ballistic missile speed roughly corresponds to range. MRBMs move faster than SRBMs, IRBMs faster than MRBMs, and ICBMs faster than IRBMs. Each iteration demands greater speed, range, and targeting capability (either in accuracy or warhead power).\nWeight: Weight roughly correlates to one or more of range/ceiling, speed/acceleration, or warhead size.\nWarhead type: Lacking precision guidance systems, early systems relied on nuclear blast to destroy ballistic missiles. Systems intended for dual-role anti-aircraft/anti-SRBM and MRBM systems typically use blast/fragmentation warheads. Newer systems intended for IRBMs and ICBMs with high-altitude interception typically use hit-to-kill kinetic intercept profiles.\nRange and ceiling: Maximum range does not necessarily coincide with maximum ceiling.\nSpeed: Speed, along with ceiling, correlates to intercept capability, with ICBMs demanding the greatest speed and acceleration. The terminal defense role of the Sprint system demanded extraordinary acceleration over a very brief period to intercept ICBMs that leaked through higher-altitude defense systems, or which were revealed when decoys disappeared at lower altitudes. A high speed at low altitude (as with Sprint) is much more challenging that a high speed at high altitude.\nThe Israeli Iron Dome system is not specifically an anti-ballistic missile system, as it is intended primarily to counter unguided rockets and artillery projectiles, rather than  guided missiles on trajectories that take them above Earth's atmosphere, re-entering at extreme velocities.\n\n\n== References ==",

He was a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMargolioth was born in Warsaw, Poland. His father, Yona, who came from a family of rabbis, and his mother Esther Yanish. In 1920, he immigrated to Israel with his parents. He studied at the Tachkemoni High School in Tel Aviv and then in Yeshivot in Jerusalem. He was one of the first graduates of Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\nHe edited the “Encyclopedia of Talmudic Sages and Geonim” and the “Encyclopedia of the History of the Gedolim of Israel,” and wrote many of their entries. He also published academic versions of several ancient works with added introductions, notes, and explanations. He published articles and research in various journals.\nIn 1946, he won the Rabbi Kook Prize for research literature and reference books.\nIn 1953, he sued Hanoch Albeck and the Devir publishing house, claiming that he was the author of Albeck's Commentary on the Mishnah of the order of Nezikin, and that Albeck only edited it.

        "content": "On February 23, 1995, at 12:03 AM EEST (21:03 UTC), a Mwr  5.9 earthquake struck Paphos District in Cyprus, with an epicenter located about 40 km (25 mi) northwest of Paphos. The earthquake was felt throughout all of Cyprus, as well as parts of northern Israel, Lebanon, and Turkey. It caused moderate damage to the surrounding area; homes had little to severe damage. Two people died and five were injured as a result of this earthquake.\n\n\n== Tectonic setting ==\nThe Island of Cyprus was created from the uplift of the Cyprus Arc, which was caused by the collision of the Anatolian Plate and the African Plate. To the East of the Cyprus Arc lies the Dead Sea Transform, and to the west is the Hellenic Arc. The East Anatolian Fault sits just northeast of the island of Cyprus.\n\n\n== Earthquake ==\nThe earthquake had a moment magnitude of 5.9 and a depth of 10 km (6 mi). Its epicenter was just 10 km (6 mi) west of the village of Neo Chorio, with its exact location found at 35.046°N 32.279°E, about 40 km (25 km) northwest of Paphos. Tremors were felt all across the island from Nicosia in the east to Limassol in the south.\nOver 70 aftershocks were reported, the strongest of which had a magnitude of 5.2 and took place just 40 minutes after the initial earthquake.\nThe 1996 Paphos Earthquake struck the near the same region that this earthquake was located.  \n\n\n== Impact ==\nFifty homes were completely destroyed as a result of the earthquake, as well as another 70 homes being seriously damaged and 500 other homes slightly damaged in the Nicosia and Paphos regions. 20 masonry homes were also destroyed as a result. Two people were killed due to a building collapse and five were injured as a result from the earthquake.

        "content": "Maxim Kopf (born Maximilian Kopf; 18 January 1892 – 6 July 1958) was an Austrian-American painter, graphic artist and sculptor. Ho worked in Prague and was a prominent figure of the German cultural life in Czechoslovakia in the interwar period. He was initially strongly influenced by Expressionism and later primarily created works with biblical themes as well as city and landscape images. He is also called a cosmopolitan painter because he created his paintings in Germany, Czechoslovakia, France, Polynesia and the United States. He traveled extensively and visited, among other places, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Dalmatia, Bessarabia and the Crimea.\n\n\n== Life and work ==\nMaxim Kopf was born on 18 January 1892 in Vienna as the second of four children of the Austrian civil servant Emil Kopf (1863–1911) and his wife Louisa, née Jagemann (* 1865). He grew up in a German-speaking family and probably also had Czech roots through his grandmother Maria Truhelková. Even before the First World War from 1911, he studied with August Brömse (1873–1925), Franz Thiele (1868–1945), Vlaho Bukovac (1855–1922) and Karl Krattner (1862–1926) at the Academy of Fine Arts, Prague. During the war he was an officer in the Joint Army of Austria-Hungary. After the end of the war he chose Czechoslovakian citizenship and stayed in Prague. He was a member of the Metznerbund and in 1919, with August Brömse, co-founder of the artist group Die Pilger, an association of German and German-speaking artists in Bohemia. The group initially included other students of Brömse such as Josef Hegenbarth, Emil Helzel, Norbert Hochsieder, Julius Pfeiffer and Leo Sternhell. Mary Duras, Walther Klemm, Moriz Melzer and Emil Orlik later joined the group, which existed until 1925. In 1920 he received a prize from the Prague Academy for the picture The Pilgrim. Thanks to a scholarship, he was able to continue his studies at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts under Otto Gussmann (1869–1926) from 1921 to 1923.\n\nKopf traveled to Tahiti and the Marquesas in 1924 and began his first South Seas cycle. In 1925 he worked for the Ziegfeld Theater. Here he was able to organize an exhibition in the New Gallery for the visiting artists Hilde Goldschmidt, Friedrich Karl Gotsch and Hans Meyboden.\nHe then stayed in Paris and Montrouge and then lived again in Prague, where his first marriage was to the sculptor Mary Duras in 1927, with whom he had already spent time in New York in 1923 . In Prague in 1927 he founded the Young Art group, which had its first exhibition in 1928 and from which the Prague Secession emerged in 1929. In the same year he also stayed in the Giant Mountains. In 1932 he traveled to Italy and stayed in Torbole on Lake Garda.  In 1933/34 he worked on the large ceiling fresco of the former German House in Prague. The marriage to Duras ended in divorce in 1933. In 1936 he married the actress Lotte Stein in Prague, but this marriage also ended in divorce in the 1940s.\nAt the end of the summer of 1934 he undertook the second voyage via Suez, Ceylon, Singapore, Sydney and New Caledonia to Tahiti, which resulted in the pictures of the second South Sea cycle. The return to Prague took place in the spring of 1935 via Martinique. In 1936 he spent a month visiting countries on the Black Sea, including the USSR, Bessarabia, Sevastopol and Yalta in the Crimea. In May 1938 he traveled to Tahiti for the third time; the return journey to Europe took place in autumn 1938 via Paris to Prague. After the fall of Czechoslovakia, he fled from Prague via Germany and Holland to Paris in March 1939, staying in Czechoslovakia's Maison de la Culture until September. He was then arrested and interned as an enemy alien for five months. He then went to French Morocco as a member of the Foreign Legion, but was interned again after France capitulated. His next stop was Martinique, where he was also interned, so that he spent a total of over two years in camps. It was not until 1941 that he was able to emigrate to the US and came to New York. In 1942 he received American citizenship . In the summer of 1942 he met the journalist Dorothy Thompson (1893–1961), whom he portrayed in her home on the Twin Farms farm in Barnard, Vermont. About a year later, Dorothy Thompson and Maxim Kopf were married in Barnard. In 1944 he exhibited at the American British Art Center. In the summer of 1945 he visited his old Czech home of Prague for the last time with Dorothy Thompson and her son. His last trip to Tahiti took place in April 1952.\nMaxim Kopf died on July 6, 1958, in Lebanon, New Hampshire and was buried at Barnard Village Cemetery in Barnard, Windsor County, Vermont. Maxim Kopf and Dorothy Thompson were buried in Barnard Cemetery.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nExhibitions with works by Maxim Kopf \n\n1922: Exhibition “April to April” together with “The Pilgrims” in the Art Association for Bohemia (Czech Krasoumná jednota ) in the Rudolfinum Prague\n1923: Maxim Kopf exhibition together with “The Pilgrims” in the Art Association for Bohemia in Prague\n1923: Maxim Kopf exhibition together with “The Pilgrims” in Dresden\n1923: Maxim Kopf's joint exhibition at the Art Association for Bohemia in Prague\n1926: Exhibition with Mary Duras at the Salon der Independenten in the Grand Palais in Paris\n1927: Exhibition at the Independent Salon in the Grand Palais in Paris\n1927: Exhibition of Maxim Kopf and Mary Duras in the Haus der Kunst, Prague\n1928: Exhibition with the “Young Art” group in the Rudolfinum Prague\n1928: Exhibition in the Artists' House in Brno\n1929: I.

        "content": "Julius Bernhard von Rohr (March 28, 1688 – April 18, 1742) was a German cameralist and writer who promoted natural or physico-theology through an appreciation of plants. His most famous book was Phyto-theologia (1740) in which he examined plants as an expression of the wisdom of a creator. Apart from theological topics, he also wrote books on jurisprudence, farming, and geography.\n\n\n== Life and work ==\nVon Rohr was born into nobility at Elsterwerda manor and castle in Saxony, the son of Julius Albert and Christine née von Pipe. He was privately tutored on the estate and then went to the University of Leipzig where he studied law according to his father's wishes but also attended classes in the natural sciences and economics. In 1710 he wrote a dissertation De retractu gentilitio filiorum in feudis and then travelled to Hamburg where he worked with his father on commercial quests. In 1711 he was sent to Frankfurt to represent his estate in the court. In 1712 he went back to the University of Leipzig and worked on Dissertatio de excolendo studio oeconomico tam principum quam privatorum followed by De jure principum circa augendas et conservandas subditorum opes. His father's estate was sold and decided not to inherit from the sales. When his father died, he lived with his mother before seeking a job. He went to Halle where he studied mathematics from Christian Wolff and wrote The Nature and Benefits of Mathematical Science in 1713 before moving to Holland briefly. In 1714 he became an assessor in the Magdeburg Monastery and in 1717 he was voted extraordinarium there. In 1726 he moved to Lower Lusatia and worked on judicial and cameral issues. He then worked in Merseburg until his retirement in 1738. He bought an estate near Meissen where he managed a vineyard and farmland.  \nVon Rohr's work on phyto-theology of 1740 followed a tradition set by Boyle, Scheuchzer, Wolff, Derham, and others. In his book he maintained that God had made plants for use by humans and that God provided different plant resources in different parts of the world. He was also a prolific writer who published 29 works and was working on 9 others. He was also involved in introducing cameral education in the universities.\nVon Rohr lived with a woman around 1724-39 but ran into troubles which he wrote about in a legal treatise. In 1739 he married a commoner.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPhyto-theologia (1740)",

        "earliest_creation_date": "2014-12-29 16:00:03",
        "content": "Bajondillo Cave (in Spanish, Cueva Bajondillo) is an archaeological site on the south-central coast of the Iberian Peninsula, in the Spanish city of Torremolinos outside of the city of Malaga. It is 127 km from the Strait of Gibraltar. It is referred to alternately, for archaeological purposes, as \"southern Iberia\".\nThe cave is thought to have been used a shelter for early modern humans and Neanderthals.\n\n\n== Archaeological excavations ==\nAn archaeological excavation of Bajondillo Cave was completed in 2011. The study revealed important information regarding the early arrival of modern humans, including their diets and behaviors. Some of the findings contradict earlier assumptions about the timing of the arrival and crossover between Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans (\"AMH\") in this region. Among other points of contradiction are previous misperceptions about the systematic consumption of shellfish among Neanderthal. The unique position and elevation of this cave offers an exceptional location for early hominid occupation, as well as for the preservation of fossils and other remnants. While no human remains were found, there were large quantities of both lithic and non-lithic fragments and artifacts that were capable of examination and stratigraphic and other date-stamping, evidencing a long period of continuous hominid cave dwelling from at least 150 ka BP.\n\n\n=== Findings ===\nThe 2011 excavation produced, among other significant findings, the most important data on record regarding the collection and consumption of shellfish by early hominids in the Iberian Region. The height and location of the cave make it clear that the large mollusk and mussel remnants were deposited by humans, as the cave was never below or at sea level. Indeed, the Bajondillo Cave is important in understanding the connection between Iberian Neanderthals and AMHs because many Neanderthal dwellings are inaccessible as they are now underwater. Moreover, many of the bones, shells, and other findings evidence intentional fracturing with force and/or thermoalteration consistent with cooking.\nThe cave was excavated in several phases and twenty archaeological levels were identified. The first seventeen levels were documented according to stratigraphic sequencing. A total of approximately 5.7 meters of sediment was excavated. Over 10,000 shellfish and related fragment samples were collected and catalogued with relative certainty to species, genus and / or class evels. Thousands more handmade tools we recovered and labeled. Extensive testing was performed, resulting in twenty-nine “absolute dates” revealing contiguous early hominid occupancy from Middle Paleolithic Era (MIS 6) to the Neolithic (MIS 1).\nPrimary site researchers from the University of Seville Miguel Cortes-Sanchez, et al. arduously defend the structural integrity of the site and its excavation and refute challenges to the technical accuracy of their findings. Specifically, the researchers posit that “improved radiocarbon protocols have …yielded reliable dates for Bajondillo,\" while rejecting claims of “displacement erosion” and cross-level contamination within the site, whether naturally-occurring or manmade.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAccording to researchers, stratigraphy within the cave indicates a lengthy chronological-cultural succession ranging from “Middle Paleolithic, Aurignacian, Gravettian, Solutrean, Magdalenian, Epipaleolithic and Neolithic” eras. Twenty levels of well-defined excavation further indicates that this cave was occupied by early hominids almost continuously for nearly 200,000 years.\nThe unique position of this cave relative to the sea below made it an ideal protective shelter for humans. There are significant fossils, physical remnants and artifacts indicating epochs of occupation, tool making, use of fire, and the cooking of several species of mammals. There is significant evidence of consumption of shellfish.\nThe excavation was performed in phases. Beginning in 1989, upon discovery, seventeen levels were excavated to a depth of 5.6m. Later phases exposed an additional 0.006 m of sediment bringing the number of “bones, shells, and hearths” and other remnants to over 10,000 pieces.\n\n\n== Physical structure ==\nThe cave is a large rock structure approximately 30 m long, with a 30 m high travertine formation. The rock formation is consistent with other limestone dwellings commonly found in that area of the Iberian Peninsula.\nThe Bajondillo Cave is currently 50 m from the coastline and +15 m above mean sea level. Over the epochs of its occupation, the cave varied from 0. km to 3 km distance from the coast. However, during the most relevant period of occupation from 150 ka BP to approximately 10 ka BP the cave was a convenient distance of approximately 00 m from the shore.\n\n\n== Significance ==\nExcavations at the site have resulted in two significant findings: Shellfish collection by Neanderthals, and that the arrival and replacement of Neanderthals by anatomically modern humans 5,000-10,000+ years later than previously believed.\n\n\n=== Shellfish ===\nThe first significant finding was a large collection of mussels and other mollusk shells, often with taphonomic features [6] including intentional fragmentation and charred markings indicative of cooking, beginning in 155 ka BP. As Miguel Cortes-Sanchez and colleagues explain:\n\"In view that systematic collection of shellfish has been increasingly recognized as a crucial element of human adaptation to aquatic ecosystems and evidence associated with the appearance of Homo sapiens, the synchronicity of these findings raise the possibility of a behavioral convergence existing in the two hominine lineages triggered by causes yet to be determined.\"\nAlthough there have been numerous “hints’ [2] and reports of evidence of Neanderthal shell fishing in the area, the Bajondillo Cave provides the first scientifically documented proof of early, systematic consumption of shellfish by non-modern humans. A principal theory states that “the expansion of the diet to incorporate foods of marine origin constitutes a key adaptation … a major shift … in the cognitive capabilities” of modern humans over Neanderthals. The significance of the Bajondillo Cave findings is that not only were Neanderthals capable of collecting shellfish for consumption in a deliberate and systematic manner, it is no longer evident that there is a clear correlation between the consumption of shellfish (requiring organization and technical skills) and the arrival of modern humans. Furthermore, there may be other unexplored convergences between Neanderthal and Anatomically Modern Humans.\n\n\n=== Replacement of Neanderthals ===\nThe second significant finding is that anatomically modern humans appear to have replaced Neanderthals much later in the southern Iberian region than previously believed. As researchers at the university of Seville observe,\n\"The final replacement of Neanderthals …in western Europe is usually dated to around 39,000 years ago… It is claimed that the southern Iberian region documents the late survival of … Neanderthals to about 32,000 years ago … [However the] Bajondillo Cave … calibrates the replacement  to between 45-43,000 years ago, raising questions about the late survival of Neanderthals in southern Iberia. \"\nAdditional postulations based upon findings in the Bajondillo Cave confirm that the dispersal of AMHs was faster and more westwardly expansive than previously believed. Earlier research indicates that AMHs only dispersed quickly into unpopulated or low-populated areas, a position which is challenged by these findings. Furthermore, evidence at Bajondillo reinforces prior research that “coasts and coastal lowlands” were a more temperate and hospitable route for early-AMH “dispersal and colonizing events” in many places throughout the world. As primary researchers Cortes-Sanchez, et al. eloquently state:\n\"[Data from] Bajondillo make perfect sense … at the time when the last Neanderthal populations were dwindling in Iberia, ecological frontiers were being broken by anatomically modern humans across many parts of the planet.\"\nThis evidence invites questions, such as whether Neanderthals and modern Homo sapiens coexisted for greater periods than previously understood [,]; whether the Strait of Gibraltar was actually a path out of Africa for modern humans [,], and confirming the importance of the Mediterranean Coast for modern humans to progress into Europe. [,]. Studies regarding the Strait of Gibraltar as a method of transit between Neanderthals and is noted as an especially “promising area of research” and one which, proven or disproven, will offer anthropological clarity.\n\n\n== References ==",

This species was compared with Nepenthes peltata Sh.Kurata. Nepenthes kampalili differs from N. peltata in its tendril that are apically attached to the leaf, its densely pubescent ground pitchers, pitcher lid that is densely pubescent, and 2 pitcher spur that occasionally arise in the posterior midsection of peristome neck, whereas in N. peltata the tendril-leaf attachment is peltate, the ground pitchers and pitcher lid are glabrous, and the presence of one unbranched pitcher spur.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe specific epithet is derived from Mt. Kampalili, the name of the area where the species was found.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nThe species is assessed as Critically Endangered since its extent of occurrence is estimated to be less than 10 km2, and the population has an estimated 200 mature individuals only.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nNepenthes kampalili is placed in Nepenthes section Villosa. Among the characters that places it in the section is its petiolate leaves, the well-developed pitcher lid, the blade-like teeth on the peristomes, the lack of central basal appendages in the pitcher lid, and its preference for high altitude ultramafic habitats.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Collaborating Political Parties (CPP) was a political alliance in Liberia. The alliance was originally formed in 2018 by four opposition political parties: the All Liberian Party (ALP), the Unity Party (UP), the Alternative National Congress (ANC), and the Liberty Party (LP). It was certified by the National Elections Commission (NEC) in 2020. By February 2022, the ALP and UP had withdrawn the alliance. By March 2022, a large faction of the LP had left as well. In April 2024, the CPP had officially dissolved.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe CPP was founded as early as 2018 by four opposition parties, the ALP, UP, ANC, and LP. In the 2017 general election, the parties had gathered a significant amount of votes fractured between them. With a collaboration, the hoped to consolidate their electoral success under one alliance, exerting more pressure on the ruling coalition, the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) led by President George Weah.\nIn 2019 Montserrado County by-elections, the CPP backed two candidates: the LP's Abraham Darius Dillon and the ALP's Telia Urey. Dillon contested the Senate race, while Urey contested the vacant seat in Montserrado's 15th House district. Dillon was successful, defeating CDC candidate Paulita C.C. Wie, despite Montserrado County being a CDC stronghold. Urey was defeated by CDC candidate Abu Kamara.\nALP leader, businessman Benoni Urey was the initial chairman of the CPP, serving for nearly two years. A framework document for the alliance was signed by the four parties in May 2020. ANC leader Alexander B. Cummings was elected chairman following the signing of the framework. The goal of the CPP, as outlined in the framework, was to present a single candidate to for all elections between and including the 2023 general election. On August 14, 2020, the CPP was certified by the NEC.\nIn the 2020 Senate election, the ruling CDC had ten losing candidates, with the CPP gaining six seats, the most of any party. Senator Dillon was re-elected. Other CPP winners included Nyonblee Karnga-Lawrence, Prince Moye, Brownie Samukai, and Jonathan Sogbie. The CPP also opposed the CDC-backed referendum, voted on alongside the Senate, which ultimately failed to pass. Dagbayonoh Kiah Nyanfore II of ModernGhana claims infighting among the constituent parties cost the CPP Senate seats.\nIn September 2021, Benoni Urey accused Cummings of tampering with the framework document ahead of the CPP primaries. Cummings denied the allegation. UP leader Joseph Boakai joined in the accusation, along with CPP chairwoman Senator Karnga-Lawrence. Urey alleged that the three leaders, besides Cummings, were never given the original framwork document. He alleged they were given a photocopy of the framework document, not the original, and that the signature page was later affixed to the original.\nOn December 23, 2021, the ALP Executive Committee held a meeting where they deliberated on the issue of leaving the CPP. The committee voted to withdraw from the alliance. The ALP also noted it would seek legal action in regard to the alleged tampering of the CPP framework document. On February 16, 2022, Boakai announced the withdrawal of the UP from the CPP. In March 2022, the faction of the LP under Senator Karnga-Lawrence broke from the CPP. LP chairman Musa Bility remained loyal to the CPP. While Karnga-Lawrence's faction was larger, Bility as chairman had legal title over the party. All parties and leaders which left the CPP retained the accusation against Cummings of altering the framework document. The legal case brought against Cummings by the ALP and UP was later dropped by state prosecutors due to lack of evidence.\nIn August 2023, the ANC and Bility's faction of the LP approved a revised version of the framework document. Cummings was unanimously endorsed as standard bearer of the CPP. Cummings selected the LP's Charlyne Brumskine as his running mate in May 2023. The CPP presidential ticket won 29,613 votes, 1.61% of the total. The CPP expressed doubt in the results of the 2023 president election, calling for an examination into the matter. Instead of supporting either Weah or Boakai in the subsequent run-off election, the CPP sent a 12-point agenda to both candidates as a condition for the CPP's endorsement. The CPP saw no victories in the 2023 Senate election. In the House elections, the CPP saw victories six victories in total. The districts they won were the following: Grand Bassa-5, Grand Kru-1, Maryland-2, Montserrado-1, Nimba-2, and Nimba-7.\nIn April 2024, the CPP held a ceremony, officiating the dissolution of the political alliance.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The butifarra (or gutifarra) is a typical street food sandwich commonly found in Lima, Peru.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe butifarra is a street food sandwich, sold in sandwich shops, typical of Peruvian cuisine, specifically from Lima, made from a special preparation of pork, locally called \"country ham,\" with salsa criolla and lettuce inside a French bread or rosette.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAccording to the fourth definition of the 2017 DLE, the butifarra is a \"Bread inside which a piece of ham and a little salad are placed.\"\nThe term \"butifarra\" is mentioned by Pedro Paz Soldán y Unanue in his Dictionary of Peruanisms from 1884, indicating that it was sold in chinganas, bullfights, and occasionally on the street.\n\n\n=== Butifarrero ===\nThe \"butifarrero\" was the one who hawked butifarras. By the late 19th century, they moved to the exit of the Plaza de toros de Acho to offer 'chicken butifarras'.\nBy the mid-1950s, this character was displaced due to the rise of street culinary trends, such as hot dogs. Currently, butifarreros sell sandwiches at public events, religious gatherings, and even at the beaches.\n\n\n== See also ==\nChicharrón\nList of sandwiches\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGarland de Pérez Palacio, Laura (1962). \"La tapada\": cuisine and pastry (in Spanish).

        "content": "Diana \"Dede\" Yazzie Devine is an Arizona-based nonprofit professional. She led the nonprofit Native American Connections for over forty years.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nDevine was born in Lansing, Michigan. As a child, she moved frequently  due to her father, Dan Devine's, career as a football coach. She was the middle of seven children.\nDevine attended the University of Wisconsin, where she interned on the Ojibwe reservation. She lived and worked there for five years, during which time the Indian-Self Determination Act was enacted. Witnessing the changes that the act gave Devine an understanding of tribal sovereignty and government.\nAs a part of her work, Devine traveled multiple times to Arizona. In 1979, Devine was introduced to a new residential treatment facility, Indian Rehabilitation. She agreed to help it until a leader could be hired. Under Devine's leadership, Indian Rehabilitation transformed into the nonprofit Native American Connections. As the organization's president and CEO, she greatly grew the organization to support Phoenix's homeless population. She was also active in the founding of the Native American Community Service Center and other services like housing programs. One of the housing communities is named after Devine.\nUnder Devine's leadership, Native American Connections developed 1,000 affordable Phoenix residences and opened twenty-three Valley projects to provide aid and social services. Greg Stanton noted that \"No one has changed as many minds about affordable housing ... in Arizona.\"\nDevine was also influential in transforming the Phoenix Indian School Visitor Center. This former American Indian boarding school became a place for Native Americans from many tribes to come together.\nTo support her work, Devine earned her MBA from Arizona State University in 1999. She attended the school while running the Native American Connections.\nDevine retired in 2023.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nDevine raised three children as a single mother.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n2003: Valley Leadership Woman of the Year\n2006:  ONE (Organization for Nonprofit Executives) Executive Director of the Year\n2008:  YWCA's Tribute to Women - Business Leader Award\n2010:  Foothills Magazine's Women Who Move the Valley\n2012:  Arizona’s 48 Most Intriguing Women\n2012:  Phoenix Business Journal's 25 Most Admired CEOs\n2016:  Community Service Golden Rule Honoree, Arizona Interfaith Movement\n2019: Morrison Institute's Distinguished Fellows\n2023: USA Today Women of the Year\n2023: Local Initiatives Support Corporation Phoenix Special Honoree\n2023: Arizona Women's Hall of Fame\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Oveco is a masculine given name from the Iberian Peninsula. It was most commonly used in northwestern Iberia. Its etymology is uncertain. A connection to the place name Oviedo has been suggested. A connection to Latin ovis (sheep) is unlikely. It is probably of pre-Roman origin, being either Iberian or, most likely, Celtic. A connection to Basque hobe (better) has been proposed, which would suggest a Christian name similar to Agathos or Bonus.\nThe name was unpopular by the 13th century. The standard patronymic forms were Ovéquiz and Ovecoz.\nBearers of the name include:\n\nOveco (bishop of Tui) (932–936)\nOveco Núñez (died 951), bishop of León\nOveco (bishop of Oviedo) (died 957/8)\nOveco Vermúdez (11th century), father of Vela Ovéquiz, Bermudo Ovéquiz and Rodrigo Ovéquiz\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Stinking Hot Springs are geothermally heated natural springs located in Box Elder County, Utah, United States. The springs are located about 6 miles (9.7 km) southwest of Bear River City, near Utah State Route 83 northwest of Corinne. Locally known as Stinky Springs, the site is one of four hot springs located along the Wasatch Range near the eastern border of the county. The source of the \"stink\" is pungent hydrogen sulfide gas that emerges with the water.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe springs were reportedly \"discovered\" in 1868. After settlement the Stinky Springs were first owned by Corinne pioneer Hiram House. According to a 1941 history of Corinne, Utah, Hiram's son W. F. House inherited the springs land and attempted to capitalize on the water resource: \"He owned much of the land in and around the town at one time and most of the small mountain, called 'Little Mountain' located about six miles west, with the railroad running around its southern tip. Here his boundless energy located and partly developed a gold mine...Hot mineral springs ran from under the mountain, and he conceived the idea of boiling the water down and bottling the mineral deposit which he distributed and sold until his death as 'Golden Youth', which probably had more merit than many of the remedies on the market at the present time. Chemists found the water of the springs contained more epsom salts than any springs in the region. Development of the springs as a health resort was one dream of the late Mr. House, which may yet be realized.\" According to the 1945 American Guide to Utah, \"At 6.9 m [on U.S. Route 15] is the junction with State 83. Left on this improved dirt road (difficult in winter) to SULPHUR SPRINGS, 6.7 m (duck hunting), flowing from the base of Little Mountain, and forming a series of pools. In late autumn, mallards fly north over the scalding springs in great flocks.\"\nThe water from this spring flows through an under-highway culvert before arriving at three pools within a \"partly vandalized cement-block bathhouse\". According to one account, H. House supposedly donated the springs to the county when he died \"with the stipulation that no one would ever be charged to use the healing sulfurous waters. Box Elder County officials agreed, in turn, to maintain the spring and its buildings, and keep the place clean. A subsequent owner of land around the spring moved the bathing building across the highway. Over the years Box Elder County forgot its part of the agreement and the building was allowed to disintegrate\". The facilities were described in 1965 as \"improvised,\" and according to a guide to hot springs of southwestern North America published in 1992, \"No one knows why this block house was built, or how it survives, but it continues to provide free soaks\". According to an Associated Press report of 2000, \"The current bathhouse has been on the site for about six months. Ferry said various bathhouses have been constructed and vandalized over the years without the landowner's permission.\" The springs were closed for several months in 2000 after a man died at the site. After his cause of death was determined to be drowning rather than carbon dioxide poisoning, the springs were reopened on a \"use at your own risk\" basis.\nThe now-unroofed building was a covered for a time with a tarp or tent. The 1999 history of Box Elder suggests that the site was considered a fearsome place at that time, with a great deal of uncollected litter, and stated that \"many people dare not go there any more. More's the pity, for waters of Stinky Springs are said to contain healing power, especially for those suffering from arthritic conditions. Many local old-timers testify of the curative powers of the waters\".\n\n\n== Water profile ==\nThe water temperature at the spring vent varies between 113–124 °F (45–51 °C) and the estimated flow rate ranges from  5–45 US gallons per minute (19–170 L/min) According to a 1970 report by a U.S. government geologist, the water emerges from the base of Little Mountain from a limestone formation created during the Mississippian period. The source of the hot water is likely a gap in a concealed fault.\nStinking Hot Springs water is quite mineralized with high levels of sodium chloride, lithium, bromide, and iodide. The saltiness and high levels of dissolved solids in the water are partly due to the \"subsurface material through which the water moves\" along the \"north margin of the saline marshes and mudflats\" of Utah's Great Salt Lake. \nIn addition to the high levels of sulphur dioxide gas, the Stinky Springs release high amounts of carbon dioxide, levels that were considered as a possible reason for a man's death at the springs in 2000. Stinking Springs, and nearby Belmont Springs and Crystal Springs, all have relatively high levels of radium, indicating a geologically significant deposit of uranium exists somewhere in the strata below. The radium levels are not believed to be a human health hazard under normal hot-spring bathing conditions.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of hot springs in the United States § Utah\nDirty Socks Hot Spring (California)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nUtahVOD: The Long Way Home - STINKY SPRINGS (YouTube)",

        "content": "Roaring Camp & Big Trees Narrow Gauge Railroad No.1, also known as \"Dixiana\", is a Class B Shay steam locomotive built in 1912 by the Lima Locomotive Works of Lima, Ohio. It was built for the W.M Ritter Lumber Company. The locomotive was retired in the mid-1950s and was purchased by F. Norman Clark for use on his Roaring Camp & Big Trees Narrow Gauge Railroad, where it still operates.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Industrial Service ===\nDixiana was built on October 12, 1912, at the Lima Locomotive Works of Lima, Ohio for the Alaculsy Lumber Company of Conasauga, Tennessee; it was their second locomotive to carry number 3. It hauled lumber trains in the mountains of Southeastern Tennessee and Northern Georgia. In 1917, No. 3 was transferred to the Tennga Lumber Company, the successor to Alaculsy, retaining its number. In March 1919, it was sold to the Southern Iron & Equipment Company, and became their No. 1466. It hauled metal at their Atlanta, Georgia plant. In August of that year, it was sold to the W. M. Ritter Lumber Company in Proctor, North Carolina, and converted to from standard gauge to 3 ft (914 mm) gauge. It returned to its previous number, becoming their second No. 3. The locomotive later moved to W.M. Ritter's McClure, Virginia operation. In 1938, the locomotive was sold to Coal Processing Corporation and carried both the No. 3 and later No. 2593 in Dixiana, Virginia.\nBy the mid-1950s, the locomotive was retired from service and left in Dixiana.\n\n\n=== Roaring Camp Railroad ===\n\nF. Norman Clark purchased Dixiana in 1958 for the Roaring Camp & Big Trees Narrow Gauge Railroad which he was setting up in Felton, California. In 1962, with help from the Southern Railway, the locomotive was shipped to New Orleans, where the SP took over and shipped it on to Los Angeles on the Sunset Limited Route. From there it was taken to Watsonville Junction and transferred over the Santa Cruz Branch Line to Felton. It arrived on October 12, 1962, fifty years to the day after it was built.\nDixiana was restored to operation and converted to burn bunker oil instead of coal to prevent trackside fires. It was named \"Dixiana\" after it's last industrial home. A new H. Belfield & Co. 3-chime whistle was installed during the restoration.\nThe restoration was completed on April 6, 1963, when Dixiana pulled its first passenger train at Roaring Camp.\nDixiana lacked a builder's plate until a replica was fitted in 2020.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nRoaring Camp & Big Trees Narrow Gauge Railroad\nSouthern Pacific Transportation Company\nSanta Cruz, Big Trees and Pacific Railway\nFelton, California\nWest Side Lumber Company railway",

The species is found distributed in the Western Pacific near areas such as the Gulf of Thailand, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Phillippines, Indonesia, Japan, Timor, and Hawaii, with the type locality coming from the Pescadore Islands of Taiwan. Habitats include sandy seafloors, seaweed, and rubble areas to forage for prey at depths up to 82 meters. The species is reddish brown in color with several white spots, with a max length of 70 cm, and a mantle length of 12.5 cm.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nCallistoctopus luteus is targeted by fisheries, such as those in the Phillippines, and is caught as bycatch throughout its range, however the full extent of this single known threat is unknown to be causing any notable effects on the species due to a lack of information. It is known to have a large range however, which as lead it to be assessed as 'Least concern' by the IUCN Red List in 2014.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Barrie Buck (née Greene) is an American entrepreneur and community activist. Since 1987, she has been the owner of the 40 Watt Club, a music venue in Athens, Georgia.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBarrie Greene grew up in Atlanta in a family that loved music. She studied ballet and played flute in her school band. She was a fan of live music since her teen years in Atlanta.\nGreene moved to Athens to attend the University of Georgia where she lived in the Creswell Hall dorm when it was not air conditioned. She graduated with a bachelor's degree in political science. She had been considering law school, but decided to stay in Athens to work after graduation.\nWhile in Athens, she got involved in the burgeoning music scene as a bartender at O'Malley's, a music venue. Later she began to bartend at the 40 Watt Club as well. Eventually the owners of the 40 Watt Club wanted to go into a different career direction and Greene bought it.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1987, she became a co-owner of the 40 Watt Club, an Athens music venue that had been in existence since 1978 at different locations and had had various owners. The corporate legal entity, 40 Watt Club, Inc., was formed in 1987 with Barrie Buck and Jared Bailey as co-directors, as well as the two equal shareholders. Originally, Bailey was the corporation's president and Buck was the Secretary-Treasurer. When the corporation did not perform well financially, Bailey resigned in June 1994 and relinquished management to Buck in order to start his own separate business. Buck then ran the corporation by herself. In a 1996 lawsuit, Buck prevailed against Bailey who had sued her after she refused to give him keys to the corporate premises.\nBuck is considered a trailblazer. Under her leadership, the 40 Watt Club become iconic in the music industry and is one of the largest private clubs in the nation. Buck is also one of the few female owners of a major music venue. She has made a name for the 40 Watt Club as a place that supports the local community. It hosts events like the \"Boybutante Ball\" benefitting a local AIDS charity, as well as events for Nuçi's Space, a nonprofit aimed at ending suicide. When the rival Athens venue, the Georgia Theatre burned in 2009, Buck used the resources of the 40 Watt Club to fundraise to help the Georgia Theatre rebuild. Under Buck's leadership, the 40 Watt Club has been an incubator for new talent, often offering the space to new acts for free.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn the spring of 1987, Barrie Greene married Peter Buck of the alternative rock band, R.E.M. She has since been known as Barrie Buck.\nBarrie and Peter Buck divorced in 1994. That same year, he became a father of twins with Stephanie Dorgan.\nIn addition to her professional work, Buck serves on the board of directors for the nonprofit, Nuçi's Space.\n\n\n== References ==",

The school began in the church building at 110 Wyche Street and steadily grew until they purchased a larger facility on Calhoun Street. CCA eventually built a new facility on Alliance Dr. which housed their middle and high school.\nIn 2013, under the leadership of Justin DuBose, CCA purchased the former Waccamaw Academy and consolidated their entire school on the Warrior Trail campus. Under DuBose, CCA started a preschool and built and dedicated a new library in honor of the founding Phillips family. \nIn 2022, CCA separated from Missionary Alliance Church and became an independent organization. CCA principal Jennifer Noble led and oversaw the move into their current location on Peacock Road.\n\n\n== Athletics ==\nCCA fields six varsity boys athletic teams (baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, and tennis) and four varsity girls athletic teams (basketball, cross country, softball, and volleyball). \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

The remote peak is the fourth-highest point of the McBride Range and 37th-highest peak within the park. Precipitation runoff and glacial meltwater from this mountain's north and east slopes drains to the Lillooet River via Tuwasus Creek, whereas the south and west slopes drain to the Pitt River. Mount Pitt is more notable for its steep rise above local terrain than for its absolute elevation as topographic relief is significant with the summit rising 1,487 metres (4,880 ft) above Tuwasus Creek in three kilometres (1.9 mi) and the west aspect rises approximately 1,200 metres (3,937 ft) in 1.5 kilometres (0.93 mi). This mountain is located near the head of Pitt River, which is named after William Pitt the Younger (1759–1806), and the mountain's toponym was officially adopted August 14, 1952, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nBased on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Pitt is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Weather fronts originating in the Pacific Ocean move east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snow. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Winter temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. This climate supports the Solitude Glacier on the east slopes. The months of July and August offer the most favorable weather for climbing Mount Pitt.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGeography of British Columbia\nGeology of British Columbia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWeather: Mount Pitt",

        "content": "William X or IX (died 1247) was the count of Auvergne from 1222 until his death.\nIn 1222, William X succeeded his father, Guy II, and inherited his conflict with the French crown. At an unknown date before 1225, William married Alix, a daughter of Duke Henry I of Brabant. The marriage was almost certainly arranged by his father in an effort to improve relations with the crown, as Brabant was an ally of the king.\n\nBetween 1222 and 1224, William X maintained contacts with King Henry III of England and received gifts from him. The Chronicle of Tours records that he signed a truce with Louis VIII of France (1223–1226) when the latter traversed Auvergne on his way south to join the war against the Cathars. His contacts with England were broken in 1228. A definitive peace with the French crown was only made under Louis IX in 1230, leaving William with a rump county with its seat at Vic-le-Comte.\nWhen Hugh X of Lusignan rebelled in 1241, William X was drawn into new negotiations with Henry III for an alliance against the French king. On 17 June 1242, Henry undertook to supply 100 knights to serve for a year under William as soon as the latter entered the war against France. William, however, chose to remain loyal to Louis IX. He placed two of his castles in the hands of Bishop Hugh of Clermont as pledges of his loyalty. He was listed among Louis's allies at the signing of the peace treaty with England on 7 April 1243. \nWilliam is the presumed patron who commissioned the Chroniques de la Bible from Moses ben Abraham. The work is largely a French translation of the Hebrew Sefer Yosippon. According to Moses, who was writing in 1244, \"my lord the Count William of Auvergne who wishes to possess and know the origins and the lineages of the beginning of the world, and wants to know the battles which have been fought in the past [ ] orders them written in this book.\" William appears as a character at the tournament of Montargis in Gerbert de Montreuil's contemporary romance, Roman de la violette.\nWilliam X was succeeded as count by his son Robert V, who inherited the County of Boulogne through his mother in 1261.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==",

If the six-minute fight time has expired without there being a winner, the fight is considered a draw, which means that both participants are eliminated.\nThe winner of a competition acquires the title of Hogmoar (also Hagmoar or Hoagmoar). This term comes from Hag (hedge, property boundary) and Meier (administrator) and used to describe an old office of free farmers with regard to jurisdiction in property matters.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nRanggeln is particularly widespread in the Alpine region, especially in South Tyrol, North Tyrol, East Tyrol, Upper Carinthia, Salzburg, the Bavarian Oberland and Chiemgau. There are numerous ranging clubs in these regions.\nOne of the most famous wrestling events is the Ranggeln at Hundstein in Salzburg. This Hundstoaranggeln was declared a UNESCO national intangible cultural heritage in Austria in 2010.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSchwingen\nJudo\nSumō\nGrappling\nWrestling\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRanggeln in Austria-Forum (in German) (at AEIOU)\nHundstoaranggeln, Pinzgau/Salzburg (Website of the Austrian UNESCO Commission)\nSalzburger Rangglerverband",

        "content": "Urceolus cyclostomus is a species of heterotrophic flagellates. It was initially described by Friedrich Stein in 1878 as Phialonema cyclostomum, from an unknown location. Due to its morphological similarities to Urceolus alenizini, the author of the latter, Konstantin Mereschkowsky, transferred it to the genus Urceolus in 1881. Like other species of the genus, its cells have a neck and a wide aperture to a canal that hosts a single flagellum and its feeding apparatus. It is distinguished from other species by a significantly more rigid cell shape, among other traits. It can be found in the bottom sediment of freshwater and brackish water bodies, as a consumer of algae.\n\n\n== Description ==\nUrceolus cyclostomus is a species of flagellate, a single-celled protist that exhibits a flagellum for movement. Members of the genus Urceolus are distinguished by the presence of a 'neck' at the anterior end of their oval-shaped cell, followed by a wide aperture or 'mouth' into a deep canal where the feeding groove and the flagellum originate. In addition, like other euglenids, the cell surface or pellicle is spiral-striped. In particular, U. cyclostomus is distinguished from other species of the genus by its more or less rigid and regular body shape, a less developed 'ingestive organelle' or feeding apparatus, and a more conspicuous 'hatching' (i.e. more pronounced stripes) of the pellicle. The posterior end of the cell is narrow, as is common in other euglenids. The flagellum is around 1.5 times longer than the cell itself, which in turn measures 14–25 μm long and 4–8 μm wide. The cells move by crawling through the substrate, with the posterior end raised.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nUrceolus cyclostomus inhabits the bottom sediment of freshwater bodies with a wide distribution. It has been recorded in bogs of the Central Russian forest-steppe region and numerous ponds in the Czech Republic, where it feeds on epipelic cyanobacteria and other kinds of algae. It is also present in brackish waters, such as salt marshes and intertidal sand of England.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe species Urceolus cyclostomus was initially described by German zoologist Friedrich Stein in his 1878 book Der Organismus der Infusionthiere, where he named the species as Phialonema cyclostomum, without specifying the location in which it was discovered. He described this new genus and species through a series of illustrations. Later, Russian biologist Konstantin Mereschkowsky compared Stein's illustrations of P. cyclostomum with the description of his own genus and species, Urceolus alenizini, which he published the previous year in 1877. Mereschkowsky noticed the extreme similarities, particularly the 'neck' with a wide aperture where the flagellum originates. In 1881, he transferred this new species to Urceolus under the name of U. cyclostomus, rendering Phialonema a junior synonym of his genus.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was released on September 24, 2021, and is the band's first album of new material in 20 years.\n\n\n== Background and reception ==\nRecorded largely during the COVID-19 lockdown, the album deals with themes such as Mike Connell's own interior world, his relationships and family life, and the broader landscape of his homeland as it struggles under the yoke of Trumpism, according to Americana UK. The album deals with more personal themes than the band's previous work and includes three remakes of tracks from Old School Dropouts.\nThe album received general acclaim. The Indy Review considered it both timeless and nostalgic, and said \"The Connells may be one of the last bands of their era to still be standing and running on all gears.\"\n\n\n== Track Listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nBass, vocals – David Connell\nDrums, vocals – Rob Ladd\nLead vocals – Doug Macmillan\nGuitar, synthesizer, vocals – Mike Ayers\nGuitar, vocals – Mike Connell\nMastered by JN-H*\nPiano, organ, synth, vocals, electric piano – Steve Potak\nProducer – John Plymale\nRecorded by John Plymale, Mitch Easter\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "A Painter (French: Le Peintre) is an oil on mahogany painting by the French painter Ernest Meissonier, created in 1855. It is held in the collection of the Cleveland Museum of Art.\n\n\n== History and description ==\nMeissonier was fond of creating paintings representing artists and musicians of the 17th and 18th centuries. To ensure the authenticity of his paintings, Meissonier often purchased accessories at local costume fairs.\nThe scene in this painting shows a 18th century painter sitting on a low chair in his studio. He appears deeply focused on painting a small canvas on an easel, depicting a mythological scene, with a nymph and a satyr. The artist holds a brush in his right hand and the remaining brushes and a palette are held in his left hand. The artist's 18th-century clothing transforms the scene into a typical historical genre painting. The mandolin behind the easel and the bust on the wardrobe indicate that the fictional artist has an interest in music and sculpture.\nMeissonier exhibited the current painting at the Salon in Paris in 1857.\n\n\n== Provenance ==\nThe painting was first bought by a private collector in 1861. It went through several owners until being acquired by the Clevelant Museum of Art, in 1982.\n\n\n== References ==",
