        "content": "The 1939 Campeonato Mancomunado Centro (Spanish: 1939 Central Joint Championship) was a football competition for clubs based primarily in the Castile region of Spain, including the Community of Madrid, played between 1 October and 19 November 1939. It was organized by the football federations that made up Spain's central zone, hence the name. This tournament was held in the form of a round-robin league and had a total of 30 matches.\nIt was the sixth joint championship of the Campeonato Regional Centro, after the Centro-Aragón in 1931–32, Centro-Sur in 1932–33 and 1933–34, and Castilla-Aragón in 1934–35 and 1935–36. The competition was then suspended for three seasons due to the Spanish Civil War. When the war had ceased in part of Andalusia, the teams from the Andalusian Federation abandoned the Centro tournament, which was suspended, to remake the Campeonato Regional Sur. This meant that the 1939 edition was contested by only six teams from the Madrid and Castilian-Leonese federations, including Real Madrid and Athletic-Aviation Club, the latter being the result of a merge between Atlético Madrid and Club Aviación Nacional, and who ended up winning the title after heading out Madrid on goal difference.\nIt was the last championship in league format played in the central regional area, due to the suppression of all national regional championships following the consolidation of the national league and its lower divisions.\n\n\n== Tournament ==\nThe teams that competed in this edition were Real Madrid CF, Atlético Aviación de Madrid, AD Ferroviaria, UD Salamanca, Imperio CF, and Real Valladolid.\nAtlético Aviación only won one of its first four matches, including a 1–2 loss to Madrid, but then won each of the remaining six Mancomunado matches, including a 3–0 victory over Madrid in the last matchday, which saw the two sides finish level on points, but Atlético Aviación winning the title with a better goal difference.\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== Leaderboards ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n1939–40 Atlético Aviación season\n1940 Spanish Super Cup\n1941–47 FEF President Cup\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Panna Fredda was an Italian progressive rock group originating in Rome in 1969. They recorded one album entitled Uno which was released in 1971.\n\n\n== Origin ==\nThe band formed in 1967 as a six-piece playing in Roman nightclubs, initially under the name 'I Figli del Sole', but later changed to 'I Vun Vun' after the club where they performed most often. After talks with the record company Vedette, they released their sax and horn players and changed their name to Panna Fredda. In 1970 they released their first single Strisce rosse/Delerio for Vedette, and in the same year a second single Una luce accesa troverai/Vedo lei followed.\nThe first line-up of the band was Angelo Giardinelli, Giorgio Brandi, Carlo Bruno and Filippo Carnevale. However this version soon dissolved, with three of the four band members leaving for various reasons. The second line-up retained Angelo Giardinelli, and added Lino Stopponi, Pasquale \"Windy\" Cavallo and Roberto Balocco. This line-up recorded their sole album Uno but their record company delayed the release until 1971 and provided very little marketing support. As a consequence the album was not successful and the group disbanded. Uno was recorded in 1970 making it \"one of the first classics of Italian progressive rock.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe album did not have a significant impact on release, however it has been positively reviewed in later years. Dag Erik Asbjørnsen reviewing Uno in Scented gardens of the mind said: \"The secrets behind the great success of this album are magnificent songwriting and musicianship, inventive instrumental ideas (often with references to classical music) and the consistent atmosphere throughout the album.\" Jerry Lucky in The progressive rock files said: \"A sound that is reminiscent of their contemporaries Banco and Semiramis only a little spicier sounding.\" Augusto Croce in Italian prog said: \"With a great album, highly representative of the Italian prog sound, Panna Fredda should have deserved more success\" and \"The voice is good, the lyrics original and the album has no weak spots.\"\n\n\n== Membership ==\n\n\n=== 1969-1970 ===\nAngelo Giardinelli: guitar, lead vocals\nGiorgio Brandi: keyboards, guitar, vocals\nCarlo Bruno: bass\nFilippo Carnevale: drums, guitar\n\n\n=== 1970-1971 ===\nAngelo Giardinelli: guitar, lead vocals\nLino Stopponi: keyboards\nPasquale \"Windy\" Cavallo: bass\nRoberto Balocco: drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Album ===\n1971 : Uno (Vedette). The album has been reissued many times; Discogs lists 15 different versions.\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n1969 : Strisce rosse/Delerio (Vedette)\n1970 : Una luce accesa troverai/Vedo lei (Vedette)\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nEncyclopedia of Italian rock, edited by Cesare Rizzi, Milano, Arcana, 1993, ISBN 978-8-87966-022-8. pp. 329-330 (in Italian).\n\n\n== See also ==\nProgressive rock\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External Links ==\nItalian prog website\nPanna Fredda at AllMusic\nPanna Fredda discography at Discogs\nPanna Fredda discography at MusicBrainz\nPanna Fredda at Prog Archives\nAudio of Uno at YouTube",

This prohibition prompted Khurram and other Afghan women to seek ways to escape and pursue education in other countries. Khurram, after a perilous journey from Afghanistan to Germany, encountered challenges in continuing her education. Collaborating with Lika Torikashvili, they initiated a program called \"E-learning in Afghanistan.\" This program engaged Afghan students and representatives from various universities, supported by financial assistance from UNESCO and other organizations, to provide educational opportunities for Afghan girls. Besides offering education, this program demonstrated the vital role of technology can play in addressing educational challenges in crisis situations.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSima samar\nTadamichi Yamamoto\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Stare Kabaty is a neighbourhood in the city of Warsaw, Poland. It is located at the boundary between districts of Ursynów and Wilanów, and divided between City Information System areas of Kabaty and Powsin. It is a small residencial area consisting of single-family housing, centred on Relaksowa Street.\nThe oldest known records of Kabady date to 1386, when it was a small farming community. It was incorporated into Warsaw in 1951.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe oldest known records of Kabady come from 1386, when it received Kulm law rights from duke Janusz I the Old, ruler of the Duchy of Warsaw. It was a small farming community, located at the edge of the Warsaw Escarpment, and on a road connecting Warsaw and Czersk. The village was owned by the Ciołek family until 17th century, when it was acquired by the Piekarski family.\nIn 1580, Kabaty and their adjusted farmlands had combined area of around 70 ha. In 1656, it was completely destroyed by the Swedish army during the Deluge, a conflict between Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Swedish Empire.\nIn 1721, Kabaty was sold to Elżbieta Sieniawska, owner of the Wilanów Estate. In 1726, she ordered the protection of the nearby Kabaty Woods from deforestation. As such, wood needed for construction in Kabaty was imported from Sieniawska's estate in Nieporęt.\nIn 1775, the village had 16 houses, and in 1827, it had the poupulation of 177 people in 17 houses.\nBetween 1850 and 1861, the populations of Kabaty and Moczydło fought in court to lower costs of their feudal duties. Following the abolition of serfdom in 1864, Kabaty was incorporated into the municipality of Wilanów. In 1892, the village was bought by Ksawery Branicki, who then established local woods administration.\nIn 1905, the village was inhabited by 319 people in 38 houses, and in 1920, by 397 people in 59 houses. During the Interwar period, im the woods near Kabaty was established a holiday village with 8 houses and the population of 61 people.\nOn 31 December 1938, the city of Warsaw bought the Kabaty Woods, and dedicated its portion for urban development. On 11 August 1980, it was given the status of the nature reserve.\nOn 15 May 1951, Kabaty were incorporated into the city of Warsaw.\nBegging in 1987, and continuing throughout 1990s and 2000s, to the east of historical Kabaty were constructed large multifamily residential neighbourhoods. As such the historical single-family housing portion of the area, to the east of Relaksowa Street, became Stare Kabaty (Old Kabaty).\nIn 2017 there were constructed Rosnowskiego Street and Korbońskiego Street, connecting Ursynów and Wilanów.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nStare Kabaty is a single-family housing neighbourhood, located between Relaksowa Street and Warsaw Escarpment. It is placed at the boundary of the City Information System areas of Kabaty and Powsin, whoch form the border of districts of Ursynów and Wilanów.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Monastery of St. Mary Magdalene is an Orthodox female monastery in Vilnius. Since 1923, the only women's monastery in the Russian Orthodox Diocese of Lithuania. Established by imperial decree on 9 November 1864, during the intensification of Russification in the former territories of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, it initially occupied the buildings of the former Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary on Ross' Street. Its church was adapted into the monastic Church of St. Mary Magdalene. The Vilnius community consisted of nuns from the St. Alexis Convent in Moscow, who ran a school, an orphanage, as well as workshops for making liturgical vestments and writing icons at the monastery. The monastery operated until 1915 when, succumbing to the panic fueled by Tsarist propaganda, the residing nuns (114 nuns and novices) left the monastery, opting for exile.\nAfter World War I, the Visitation nuns returned to Vilnius, regaining their convent on Ross' Street. Upon the initiative of Bishop Eleutherius (Bogojawleński) of Vilnius and Lithuania, Orthodox nuns moved to one of the buildings of the Monastery of the Holy Trinity in Vilnius, and in 1937 to the former school buildings near the Church of St. Alexander Nevsky. They were forced to leave by the Soviet authorities in 1960. From then on, the monastic community resided in one of the wings of the complex of the Monastery of the Holy Spirit in Vilnius; the return to the original location took place in 2015.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== In the Russian Empire ===\n\n\n==== Establishment of the monastery ====\nThe establishment of the women's monastery in Vilnius was connected with the Russification campaign in the Lithuanian lands through the promotion of Russia's state religion – Eastern Orthodoxy. At the time of its founding, it was the third monastic community of this denomination in Vilnius, alongside the male monasteries of the Holy Spirit and the Holy Trinity. The founding document of the Monastery of St. Mary Magdalene dates back to 9 November 1864. The order in this matter was personally signed by Tsar Alexander II. Orthodox nuns, according to it, took over the Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary, which was simultaneously dissolved. According to the monastery's chronicle written in 1965 by Sister Barbara (Trofimowa), the Visitation nuns were allowed to leave the country along with most of the movable property. The establishment of the monastery was blessed by the Orthodox Metropolitan of Vilnius and Lithuania, Joseph Semashko. Metropolitan Philaret Drozdov of Moscow was also particularly involved in its creation. According to the founding charter, the nuns were to run an orphanage at the monastery, which was opened on July 22 of the following year.The nuns who established the Monastery of St. Mary Magdalene came from the St. Alexis Convent in Moscow. The first abbess was nun Flaviana (Popova). On October 22, Bishop Ignatius of Brest, in accordance with the resolution of the Most Holy Synod, bestowed upon her the dignity of hegumeness. Hegumeness Flaviana, over the next few years, carried out a thorough renovation of the buildings previously belonging to the Visitation nuns, coupled with the transformation of the monastic Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in Vilnius into the Church of St. Mary Magdalene.\n\nIn addition to the reconstruction of the main temple during the works, a second church was arranged, dedicated to the Protection of the Mother of God, and part of the residential buildings was adapted into accommodations for the orphanage. The hegumeness fully enforced the monastery rule's provisions upon the sisters (including those who came from Moscow), formed a choir from them, and herself engaged in the work of the orphanage from 1868 (i.e., from the admission of the first wards). She was the director of the orphanage. She also led the school of painting established at the monastery. The icons, complete iconostases, and other works created by the nuns and the wards of the orphanage were used in churches in Vilnius and beyond. Another workshop run by the nuns dealt with sewing liturgical garments. For exemplary management of the newly established monastery, Hegumeness Flaviana was awarded the right to wear a pectoral cross in 1871. In 1877, for the same reason, she was nominated for the award of a cross with ornaments, but she did not live to receive it (she passed away in 1878).\n\n\n==== Activity of the monastery until the time of emigration ====\nAfter the death of Hegumeness Flaviana, her duties were taken over by nun Antonina (Zołotariowa), who arrived with her from Moscow. She received the title of hegumeness from Archbishop Macarius Bulgakov of the Russian Orthodox Diocese of Lithuania less than two months after formally assuming the position on 22 June 1878. This nun remained at the helm of the community until 1900, when she resigned due to old age. She passed away in the monastery four years later. Archbishop Juwenaliusz (Połowcew) of the Russian Orthodox Diocese of Lithuania appointed Hegumeness Moiseyeva (Lalina), who was brought from another monastery, as her successor. She initiated a comprehensive renovation of the monastery buildings, during which the churches were lined with marble, a new altar was installed in the main church, and all of them were enriched with new icons. During the tenure of Hegumeness Moiseyeva, the nuns ran a school for 40 daughters of clergy or government officials working in the western and northern parts of the Russian Empire. The icon-painting workshop continued its work.According to a description in a Russian guidebook to Vilnius published in the early 20th century, the monastery was situated in an extremely picturesque location, and the complex of buildings occupied by the nuns was surrounded by a well-kept orchard. The activity of the school run by the nuns and the level of singing in the monastery church were also highly praised.In 1912, when the hegumeness resigned from her position at her own request, there were 89 nuns in the monastery. The Most Holy Synod appointed nun Vera (Potapienko) as the new hegumeness, who had previously lived in one of the monasteries in St. Petersburg. In 1914, she organized a hospital for 15 soldiers at the monastery.\n\n\n==== Departure from Vilnius ====\nOn July 22 (August 4 according to the Gregorian calendar) 1915, Metropolitan Tikhon of Moscow conducted the final Divine Liturgy in the monastery's Church of St. Mary Magdalene. On September 14 of the same year, the nuns and the children under their care, fleeing from the front, embarked on a journey of emigration. A total of 114 nuns and students left the monastery, taking their movable property with them. Initially, they went to Minsk, and after a month, to Petrograd. In Petrograd, the group split: those nuns who wished to do so went to their relatives, while others remained in various monasteries in the capital of Russia. Meanwhile, the shelter continued to operate in its previous form. Fifty nuns, along with their Mother Superior, were transferred to the Monastery of St. Mary Magdalene in Vokhonovo near Tsarskoye Selo. In 1918, nun Vera (Potapienko) was elevated to the rank of hegumeness.In 1918, Hegumeness Vera fell ill and resigned from her position, after which she went to her family in Finland. She was succeeded by Hegumeness Nina (Bataszowa). She, too, decided to return to Vilnius with some of the nuns (about 20 people). In the same year, she obtained permission for this from Patriarch Tikhon of Moscow and all Russia. However, upon the arrival of the nuns in Lithuanian lands, it turned out that the monastery buildings were occupied for the needs of the German army, and the nuns could only inhabit a few rooms in the complex of buildings. They also lost this part when, in 1919, the Visitation nuns legally regained their former property.\n\n\n=== In the Second Polish Republic ===\nNot wanting to allow the community to disperse, Bishop Eleutherius (Bogojawleński) of the Russian Orthodox Diocese of Lithuania allowed Sister Nina and the remaining sisters to settle in the buildings of the Holy Trinity male monastery, located on Ostrobramska Street in the center of the Old Town. The material situation of the monastery was much more difficult than before World War I. The nuns lost their landed estates granted to them before the war by the tsarist authorities, which were confiscated by Catholic institutions or Polish owners. They were left with only 240 hectares of forest in the Wiatrówka estate, which was a donation from Russian state forests, and 67 hectares of land with a summer house near Nemenczyn. Despite this, the monastery's chronicle reports that normal community life, despite all the difficulties, was restored. The nuns held the Vilnius icon of the Mother of God in special reverence. This is confirmed by the fact that in 1921, Patriarch Tikhon of Moscow confirmed the election of Sister Nina (Bataszowa) as the head of the monastery and rewarded her with the right to wear a pectoral cross. On November 8 of the same year, Archbishop Eleutherius of the Russian Orthodox Diocese of Lithuania bestowed upon her the rank of hegumeness.Partly due to the circumstances of its establishment, the Polish authorities considered the Orthodox female monastery in Vilnius unnecessary and sought its liquidation. As a result, the nuns were charged a high rent for the use of the buildings of the Monastery of the Holy Trinity, which was also nationalized after World War I, but leased to several Orthodox monastic communities. From 1928 to 1931, Hegumeness Nina (Bataszowa) held negotiations with the authorities regarding the partial forgiveness of the debt. She requested a grant to the monastery in the amount of 2768.28 zlotys and committed to repay it in 18 installments. Supported by the Warsaw metropolitans – first by George Yaroshevsky, then by Dionysius Waledyński – the head of the community consistently requested since 1918 permission to merge the female monastic communities of St. Mary Magdalene in Vilnius and Berezwecz and to allow them to take over the Church of St. Michael Archistrategus in Vilnius along with the buildings of the former school. However, the Ministry of National Education ruled that there were no grounds for the Orthodox Church to take over these properties.\n\nThe efforts of Hegumeness Nina to obtain permission to conduct fundraising for the construction of a new monastery from scratch, where the nuns could reside, also ended in failure. The Governor of Vilnius wrote:The matter of fundraising should be denied, as such a broadly conceived collection, intended to encompass all eastern voivodeships, could easily be given a propagandistic-agitational character and utilized (...) in a direction hostile to the Polish statehood, presenting the fundraising act as allegedly caused by the dire financial situation of the Orthodox Church in Poland.Ultimately, Hegumeness Nina obtained permission for the nuns to move to the buildings of the former parish school near another Orthodox church in Vilnius (St. Alexander Nevsky), located in the Naujininkai district. On 1 May 1937, the Synod of Bishops of the Polish Orthodox Church merged the two female monastic communities according to previous plans, and Metropolitan Dionizy obtained permission to build a larger residential facility for the 32 nuns of the monastery and to conduct fundraising for this purpose. Up to that time, the nuns' only means of support were the manual labor they performed and the voluntary contributions of the faithful. With the financial assistance of the faithful, the nuns carried out a general renovation of the church, adapted the former school buildings for their purposes, and established an orchard and garden around the buildings. At the time of the merger of the monasteries, the Synod of the Polish Orthodox Church considered naming the new community after the Holy Trinity; however, it was ultimately decided to adopt Mary Magdalene as its patron saint.The significance of the monastery for female monasticism in the Polish Orthodox Church is evidenced by the fact that two nuns from the Vilnius community were appointed hegumenesses and placed in charge of other female monasteries. This occurred in 1931; the nuns from the Monastery of St. Mary Magdalene were appointed as superiors of the monasteries in Zymne and Korets. In 1939, Metropolitan Dionizy of Warsaw, as a testament to the importance of the Monastery of St. Mary Magdalene for Orthodoxy in the Lithuanian lands, donated to the nuns' church icons of St. Job of Pochayev and St. Mary Magdalene with their relics, as well as a copy of the Theotokos of Pochayiv. Throughout the entire period of World War II, the monastery remained active.\n\n\n=== In the USSR ===\n\n\n==== World War II and the 1940s ====\nOn 10 July 1944, the Church of St. Alexander Nevsky suffered serious damage due to an air raid. The main dome and bell tower were destroyed, and residential buildings were damaged. The original interior furnishings also suffered almost complete destruction, with the iconostasis burning down. As a result, in the early years after the war, the function of the church was fulfilled by a makeshift home chapel set up in the right wing of the building complex. In 1947, the nuns completed the reconstruction of the residential quarters and bell tower. Two years later, the main dome was rebuilt. Simultaneously, work was underway to reconstruct the interior of the church, mainly delayed due to a lack of funds to purchase materials. On 8 November 1951, Archbishop Focjusz (Topiro) of the Russian Orthodox Diocese of Lithuania re-consecrated the building. At that time, the nuns had the Church of St. Alexander Nevsky and the home chapel of St. Mary Magdalene. Four years later, with financial assistance from the Moscow Patriarchate, the monastery facilities were expanded: in addition to a two-story house for the nuns, a laundry room was built, the guardhouse was renovated, the complex of buildings was surrounded by a brick wall, and water and electricity were supplied. The monastery housed 35 nuns. In 1947, one of them, Tabita (Dmitruk), was transferred to the Monastery of the Holy Trinity and St. Sergius of Radonezh in Riga as the hegumeness.\n\n\n==== Closing of the Church of St. Alexander Nevsky ====\nIn 1957, the monastery housed 17 nuns, 12 rasophore sisters and novices. Further expansion of the church and monastery was planned, but on 12 June 1959, despite parishioner protests, both the monastery and the church were removed from the register of active Orthodox religious sites. This was equivalent to the confiscation of monastery property. Parishioners sent a letter to Nikita Khrushchev, requesting consideration of the church's importance to the southern districts of Vilnius, but to no avail. On 28 August 1960, the last nuns left the monastery premises. At that time, there were 23 nuns and 5 novices living in the monastery. They relocated to the buildings of the male Monastery of the Holy Spirit, where they remained until 2015. They retained most of the monastery's movable property, except for individual items transferred to the Cathedral of the Theotokos in Vilnius. A few nuns settled in the Pühtitsa Convent.\n\n\n==== In the Monastery of the Holy Spirit ====\nThe life of both monasteries was largely integrated: the nuns worked for both communities in the kitchen, garden, office, baked prosphora, took care of the Orthodox cemetery in Vilnius, and sang in the choir of the Church of the Holy Spirit in Vilnius. The nuns occupied one of the wings of the monastery complex. In 1965, the 100th anniversary of the monastery's existence was solemnly celebrated. In 1989, the Council of Ministers of Lithuania declared the nullity of the decree abolishing the monastery, which gave it a legal basis for independent functioning also de jure.The Mother Superior of the Monastery of St. Mary Magdalene remained until 1968 Hegumeness Nina (Bataszowa), who then took the vows of the Great Schema with the name Barbara, thereby stepping down from her position (she died in 1969). She was replaced by her niece, Sister Angelina (Bataszowa). In the same year, Sister Barbara (Trofimowa) left the community, and as an hegumeness, she took the lead of the Pühtitsa Convent.\n\n\n=== In independent Lithuania ===\n\n\n==== In the Monastery of the Holy Spirit ====\nIn 2002, Sister Nadzieja (Łomako) became the new Mother Superior. Two years later, the monastery was home to 9 nuns and 4 novices. The website of the Russian Orthodox Diocese of Lithuania stated that in 2010, the community consisted of 12 nuns. This is the only Orthodox female monastery in Lithuania. In 2011, the Mother Superior of the community was Sister Archełaja (Iwanowa).\n\n\n==== Return to the facilities at the Church of St. Alexander Nevsky ====\nOn 24 May 2015, the nuns returned to the buildings used by the community from 1937 to 1960, located near the Church of St. Alexander Nevsky. On the same day, the Mother Superior of the monastery, Sister Serafina (Iwanowa), was elevated to the rank of hegumeness. In 2016, the community consisted of 9 nuns and 1 novice.Two former Mother Superiors of the monastery, Igumenia Flawiana and Antonina, were buried near the monastery buildings used until 1915. Other burials of the sisters were and continue to be carried out at the Orthodox cemetery in Vilnius, in a designated section.\n\n\n==== Branch church in Posakiszki ====\nIn 2022, the construction of the branch church dedicated to the Icon of the Mother of God \"Joy and Consolation\" in Posakiszki (Bezdonys Eldership, Vilnius District Municipality) was completed. On February 3 of that year, the facility was consecrated by Metropolitan Innocent of Vilnius and Lithuania.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDobrianski, F. \"Старая и новая Вильна.

Following the Union victory in Atlanta, Sherman wanted to destroy Confederate grain supplies in  northeastern Georgia. In an effort to assist his war effort and Ulysses S. Grant in the Siege of Petersburg, since Georgian grain was feeding the respective armies.\n\n\n== The Battle ==\nSherman sent out Kenner Garrard to go raid and capture the mostly undefended northeastern Georgia. Union forces arrived in the narrows outside of Currahee mountain, following a quick battle, the Union forces withdrew. The defense was mostly organized by locals. Casualties on both sides were very few, with locals helping with the wounded on both sides.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCooksey, Elizabeth (July 7, 2022). \"Habersham County\".

        "content": "Walter Booser \"Chip\" Detweiler (September 19, 1932 – February 4, 1984) was an American architect who practiced primarily in Hawai’i.  He was awarded a Bachelor of Architecture from Carnegie Mellon University in 1955, and did one year of graduate architectural studies at Yale University. Detweiler’s choices of rugged site and use of strong clean lines, intersecting planes and indigenous materials places his work solidly in the Tropical Modernism or Tropical Brutalist style.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nDetweiler was born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania on September 19, 1932. He graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in 1955 with a Bachelor of Architecture. From 1955 – 1957, Detweiler served in the United States Army as First lieutenant and Construction Supervisor in the United States Army Corps of Engineers, at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam. Returning to the United States from Guam in 1957, Detweiler joined the firm D.K. Ritchey Associates in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as a draftsman, delineator and designer, and spent two years working on local community space projects such as Northview Heights Housing, the Frick Park Nature Museum and the gymnasium/natatorium for the University of Pittsburgh. After a brief stint in Los Angeles working for the firm Daniel, Mann, Johnson and Mendenhall, and then a four-month trip to Japan, Detweiler returned to the East coast to pursue graduate studies in architecture at Yale University, but left the program after only one year, purportedly after a very harsh critique of a class project by Paul Rudolph.\n\n\n== Early career ==\nDetweiler next turned up in Manila Philippines, where he was the chief architect for all Southeast Asia projects for Adrian Wilson and Associates, a successful California-based architecture firm handling many government and military contracts. A selected list of Detweiler’s projects taken from his 1968 resume includes various officer’s clubs, storage facilities and a theater at Mactan Air Base in Cebu, in the Philippines, operational facilities and housing at Clark Air Base on Luzon Island, in the Philippines, Saigon Military Hospital in Vietnam, and military recreational facilities in Okinawa Japan and Taiwan. Detweiler remained in Southeast Asia until 1967.\n\n\n== Later life and career ==\n\n\n=== Meyers, Detweiler & Associates firm ===\nDetweiler landed next in Honolulu, Hawaii. He worked for one year as chief designer and associate partner for Leo S. Wou and Associates, before establishing his own firm in 1968, with partner Irwin Don Meyers. Projects included proposed and built residences on Lot 85 and Lot 49 in the Koko-kai neighborhood of Oahu, as well as additions on other homes and offices. The firm’s first major project was the Airport Center building on Ualena Street in Honolulu, built for F.T. Opperman and Associates. With its bold, modern design the building remains a local landmark to this day, made even more iconic by the addition of giant murals depicting breaching whales painted by artist Wyland on one side of the structure in the late 1990s.\n\n\n=== Residential projects ===\nIn 1973, Detweiler designed and built a private residence for himself on Round Top Drive in Honolulu, constructed on a steep, what some considered “unbuildable” site with sweeping views of the city.  Detweiler’s design for the house—simple yet clever with intersecting horizontal and vertical planes, blends Tropical Modernism and Brutalist architecture. The house—referred to as the Detweiler House—fits seamlessly into its hillside environment, with a carefully designed air circulation system involving large clerestory windows with cantilevered glass and other openings with louvered wooden jalousie blinds, which channel the Hawaiian trade winds through the house, cooling it naturally and eliminating the need for a mechanical system. Detweiler lived in the house—first with his wife Ginny and then later with his professional and life partner designer Dian Cleve—until his death in 1984. \nDetweiler’s other major residential project was a house on Loa Ridge, also in Honolulu. It is a very similar siting and design to Detweiler House—another steep site with spectacular views, the design also featuring horizontal planes and a cleverly designed air flow system that takes advantage of the location. His partner Dian Cleve designed the interiors, using the surrounding landscape as inspiration for the palette.\nIn 2020, the house was listed for sale, Vilcek Foundation President Rick Kinsel purchased Detweiler House, and had the house meticulously restored to the architect’s original design and intention using Detweiler’s archive of drawings.\n\n\n=== Recognition and awards ===\nThe Detweiler House won an American Institute of Architects-Sunset Magazine Merit Award in 1978. In 2022, after Kinsel’s restoration, the house won a project award from the Historic Hawaii Foundation. In 2022, it was an Editor’s Pick for The Architect’s Newspaper's  Best of Design Award in residential restoration. In 2023 Detweiler House was also accepted for inclusion on the Hawaii State Historic Register.\nDetweiler's Hawaii Loa Ridge house also won an HS/A.I.A. Design Award/Award of Merit in 1984, which was reported in Hawaii Architect, the Journal of the Hawaii Society of the American Institute of Architects.\n\n\n=== Philosophy, ideology and beliefs ===\nChip Detweiler said about his work, “The idea of architecture gives complete meaning to my life.  The intellectual, spatial, functional and economic relationships are the inevitable reflection of truth, honesty and integrity, which are the ideals I strive for in my life.”\n\n\n=== Death ===\nChip Detweiler died on February 4, 1984.\n\n\n== References ==",

Interspersed with the familiar iconography of the game are pictures of its founders, internal corporate memos, and rarely seen sketches that led to the more familiar final versions of the artwork. It is not only an essential work for current gamers, but also for those who have fond memories of playing AD&D when it caused one to be ostracized rather than celebrated.\"\n\n\n== Reviews ==\nForbes\nThe New York Times\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Art & Arcana: A Visual History | RPG Item\".

        "content": "Leila Mejdalani Pereira (born November 11, 1964) is a Brazilian businesswoman, lawyer, journalist and sports director. She became known for presiding over the financial company Crefisa and for her activities at association football club, Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras, of which she has been president since 2021.\nAt Palmeiras, Leila became the club's sponsor through Crefisa and Faculdade das Américas (FAM). The partnership began in 2015, and Leila became an advisor to the club, becoming president.\nSince the beginning of the partnership with Crefisa, Palmeiras has achieved important achievements, including two Copa Libertadores da América titles. The club also managed to win three more Campeonato Brasileiro titles.\nIn 2022, Forbes listed Leila Pereira as the fifth richest woman in Brazil.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nPereira was born on 11 November 1964 in Cambuci and raised in Cabo Frio, Rio de Janeiro, being the daughter of a middle-class family. Her brothers pursued careers in medicine, while Leila was raised to be a housewife and have children. However, against her father's wishes and with her mother's support, she moved to Rio de Janeiro to attend college.\nShe entered the journalism faculty at Estácio de Sá University and got an internship at Rede Manchete. She spent a short time in journalism, but had her first introduction to sport when she participated in the coverage of the 1990 FIFA World Cup.\nWhen she was studying journalism, Leila met businessman José Roberto Lamacchia, founder of Crefisa, during a carnival party in Ipanema. The two were no longer separated and he started visiting her every fifteen days, since he lived in Jardins, in São Paulo.\nAdvised by Beto, she began studying law, graduating from Cândido Mendes University. She moved to São Paulo in 1996 and tried to be a judge, but was unsuccessful in a public exam and ended up opening an office. Leila and José Roberto Lamacchia married in 1999.\nShe began working with her husband in 2000, helping with the company's legal processes. In 2008, she became head of Crefisa and the Centro Universitário das Américas (FAM).\n\n\n=== Partnership with Palmeiras ===\n\nLeila started sponsoring Palmeiras in 2015. One of the first big moves in Crefisa's sponsorship of the club was the signing of striker Dudu, bought for approximately 35 million reais thanks to a contribution from the finance company.\nAt the time, Palmeiras was coming from a troubled season. The club spent 2014 fighting against relegation, escaping in the last round. In 2015, in the first year of partnership with Crefisa, alviverde had won the Copa do Brasil.\nIn 2017, she managed to become an advisor to the club. Thanks to a letter from former president Mustafá Contursi, she was able to prove that she had been a member since 1996, qualifying her to compete for one of the vacancies. With 250 votes, she ended up being the most voted in the election for the Palmeiras board.\nTo continue with a good relationship, Crefisa transferred 70 tickets to Contursi. However, in 2017, prosecutors suspected that these tickets were being sold, which would be illegal. The case ended up being closed due to lack of evidence, but the relationship between Contursi and Crefisa was broken.\nSince then, Palmeiras has added more achievements. There were two Campeonato Brasileiro (2016 and 2018), the 2020 Campeonato Paulista and the 2020 Copa Libertadores da América.\n\n\n=== Club presidency ===\nOn November 20, 2021, in a vote with a single ticket, Leila was elected the 56th president in the club's history, being the first woman – she received 1,897 votes from members out of a total of 2,141.\nDespite currently having a strong connection with the São Paulo club, being a sponsorer and president, interestingly Leila supported another football club before the partnership: Vasco da Gama\nShortly after winning the presidency, Leila celebrated another title for Palmeiras: the 2021 Copa Libertadores da América. Leila Pereira's term at the helm of the club began on December 15, 2021.\nHis first year as president of Palmeiras was marked by the achievements of the 2022 Campeonato Brasileiro, the Recopa Sudamericana and the Campeonato Paulista. In the women's category, Alviverde won the Libertadores and the Campeonato Paulista. The club was also successful at youth level, with titles in the São Paulo Junior Football Cup, the Brazilian Under-20 Championship and the Brazilian Under-17 Championship.\nIn October 2022, Leila and her husband, José Roberto Lamacchia, founded an airline under the name Placar Linhas Aéreas S/A. In January 2023, she announced the purchase of an E190 for the club's use in games outside São Paulo, with the aircraft joining another that the president also had in the name of the airline.\n\n\n==== Palmeiras' supporter protests ====\nLeila became the target of protests from Palmeiras fans, mainly from Mancha Alviverde. The manager's bad relationship with the organized fans began in the first months of Leila's management at Palmeiras, after the president did not respond to the fans' desire to change the reserved place at Allianz Parque. In 2023, Leila began to be criticized for the delay in hiring reinforcements for the season. In June, fans mocked the director's purchase of the plane during a protest in front of Crefisa's headquarters.\n\n\n==== Purchase of Arena Barueri ====\nOn October 24, 2023, Crefipar, Leila Pereira's company, won the concession to manage Arena Barueri. Leila stated that the company will invest up to $100 million over the next 35 years, becoming the venue for Palmeiras games when Allianz Parque is not available.\n\n\n==== 2023 Campeonato Brasileiro ====\nIn December 2023, she led the Palmeiras team, winning the 2023, in a great performance recovery in the second round of the tournament, with the partnership of coach Abel Ferreira.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Leila Pereira\".

        "content": "Patrick Gerard (11 June 1794 – 4 October 1848) was a Scottish writer. Pinus gerardiana is named after him.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGerard was the son of Gilbert Gerard, D.D., and brother of Alexander and of James Gilbert Gerard. He was born 11 June 1794. He probably entered the King's or Marischal College, Aberdeen, in 1808, and received a Bengal cadetship in 1812. He was appointed ensign in the 8th Bengal native infantry on 19 August 1812; became lieutenant therein on 16 December 1814, and brevet captain on 19 August 1827. He became captain in the 9th native infantry on 11 April 1828, and was placed on the invalid establishment in India on 8 August 1832. Most of his service was regimental, part of it attached to the hill corps, of which his brother James Gilbert was surgeon, the 1st Nusseerabad battalion. He died at Simla on 4 October 1848.\nGerard was author of ‘Observations on the Climate of Subathoo and Kotguhr’ in ‘Asiat. Res.’ xv. 469–88, meteorological observations made hourly for the space of nearly two years; of ‘Account of the Climate and Agriculture of Subathoo and Kotguhr’ in ‘Edinburgh Journal of Science’ (1828), ix. 233–41, cf. Froriep's ‘Notizen’ (1829), xxiii. cols. 65–71; and of ‘Remarks on some Mineral Products of the Himalayas’ in ‘Delhi Medical Journal’ (1844), i. 62–71. A joint paper by Alexander and Patrick, entitled ‘Account of a Journey through the Himalaya Mountains,’ appeared in ‘Edinburgh Philos. Journal’ (1824), x. 295–305. ‘A Journal of Meteorological Observations made in India from 1817 to 1829,’ by Patrick, forms British Museum Addit. MSS. 24017–22.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Chichester, Henry Manners (1890). \"Gerard, Patrick\". In Stephen, Leslie (ed.).

        "content": "Unbroke is the eleventh studio album by American country artist Sara Evans. The album is set to be released on June 7, 2024, via a partnership between Melody Place and Evans' own imprint Born to Fly Records. It is Evans' first album of original material in seven years, following 2017's Words, and her first collection of songs since 2020's cover album Copy That. Evans co-wrote ten of the project's eleven songs and co-produced the album with Jeff Trott. It was preceded by the release of the lead single \"Pride\".\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe album was announced alongside the release of its lead single \"Pride\" on March 21, 2024. In an interview with Billboard, Evans explained that the content of the album is largely inspired by her tumultuous relationship with her husband Jay Barker, the abuse she has suffered during their marriage, and her decision to ultimately reconcile with him following an incident in January 2022 where he was arrested for almost hitting her with his truck. Additionally, the album examines Evans' strained relationship with her father following his divorce from her mother, and how this informed her relationship to Barker. Discussing the personal lyrics on the project, she stated “I’m super proud of these lyrics. My co-writers were so understanding and careful and gracious in letting me guide them through my journey. The writing aspect of this is something I’m so proud of, because the story is mine to tell.” Evans contemplated changing the perspective of \"Pride\" from first-person to third-person following the couple's reconciliation, but Barker encouraged her to keep the song as is because it was her story to tell. The music video for \"Pride\" premiered on March 27, 2024, and stars Evans' daughter Audrey Evans.\nIn conjunction with the album's announcement, Evans also launched a new podcast, Diving in Deep with Sara Evans, which premiered its first episode on March 21, 2024.\nEvans co-wrote ten of the album's eleven songs, including \"21 Days\" with Melissa Fuller and Jeff Trott, and decided to have Trott produce the entire record after she liked the work he did on the demo of the song. The album chronicles the recent events in her personal life from the beginning of the abuse to the reconciliation of her marriage and the couple restarting their lives together.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nTracklisting adapted from Apple Music.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSara Evans albums discography at Sara Evans.com",

        "content": "Bank Polski SA, full name Bank Polski Spółka Akcyjna (lit. 'Bank of Poland Joint-stock Company'), sometimes referred to as the \"Second Bank of Poland\" to distinguish it from its 19th-century namesake, was the central bank of the Second Polish Republic. It was founded in 1924 and operated until the invasion of Poland in 1939, after which it relocated to London together with the Polish Government in Exile. In liberated Poland, it was replaced in 1945 by the National Bank of Poland, and was eventually liquidated in 1952. \n\n\n== History ==\nWhen Poland emerged as an independent country in 1918, it combined territories formerly under the central banking jurisdiction of the State Bank of the Russian Empire, Austro-Hungarian Bank, and German Reichsbank, and had no central bank of its own. For a few years, the Polish National Loan Fund took over a temporary role of issuing currency, but was unable to avert hyperinflation.\nFollowing the State Treasury Repair Act of January 11, 1924, minister Władysław Grabski undertook monetary reform, a key part of which was the establishment of the Bank of Poland, re-using the name of the 19th-century Bank Polski. The new institution was created as a joint stock company whose shares were offered to the Polish public. Its stock was soon raised from the initial 100,000,000 złotych to 150 million, split onto 1.5 million shares. As the main shareholder, the President of Poland had the right to name the chairman and deputy chairman of the bank's board of trustees. In 1926 and 1927, the government formally waived the right to issue Polish currency in favor of Bank Polski SA, confirmed its independence from the government and appointed a foreign advisor to a member of the Bank's Council, taking inspiration from the stabilization programs implemented in neighboring countries by the Economic and Financial Organization of the League of Nations. The first such foreign adviser, appointed in November 1927, was Charles S. Dewey, previously United States Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Fiscal Affairs.\nAt least 30 percent of the money was to be backed by gold (and a smaller amount by silver) and foreign currencies; after the reform of 1927, this threshold was increased to 40 percent. The dividend paid to shareholders could not exceed 8 percent. When the profit was between 8 to 12 percent, half went to the State Treasury and the other half to shareholders as a superdividend. Above 12 percent, the state collected two thirds.\nPrior to the invasion of Poland in 1939, at the initiative of Ignacy Matuszewski and Henryk Floyar-Rajchman, the Bank of Poland evacuated all of its gold reserves (105,000 kg) from Poland to the Bank of France in Paris, through Romania , Turkey and Syria,  and then most of it to Canada and the Bank of England in London. Following the invasion, the Bank of Poland relocated, first in Paris from 19 September 1939 to 1 July 1940, then in London together with the Polish Government in Exile, and financed most of the latter's military effort. Meanwhile, in occupied Poland, the Third Reich in 1940 created the Bank of Issue in Poland for its General Government, issuing the so-called German \"Kraków-złoty\". In other parts of the former Polish territory, central banking was taken over respectively by the Nazi German Reichsbank and Soviet Gosbank.\nSimilarly to other Allied Military Currency bank notes, American \"Liberation banknotes\" for Poland were printed in 1944. On 15 January 1945, the new communist authorities of Poland founded the National Bank of Poland (NBP).In 1946, the bank's governor Bohdan Winiarski led the decision to move the institution back to Warsaw. A stock of gold from the Bank's deposits in British, French and American banks was returned to Poland, as well as banknotes printed in Great Britain and intended for circulation in the country. However, they notes were not released into circulation because the Polish government, upon establishment of the NBP, had deprived the Bank Polski of its note-issuance privilege. Meanwhile, the stock of gold that backed those banknotes was distributed by the communist authorities for budget expenditure in the years 1946–1958, and was partially allocated to compensation for citizens of foreign countries expropriated as a result of the Polish Act on the Nationalization of Industry. This was done by transferring appropriate deposits to the governments of the US, UK and France through clearing agreements, whereby these governments took over liabilities towards their citizens in respect of property expropriated in Poland. Eventually, the Bank Polski SA was liquidated, starting in 1951 and ending on 7 January 1952.\n\n\n== Leadership ==\nThe successive Governors of the Bank of Poland were: \n\nStanisław Karpiński (1924–1929)\nWładysław Wróblewski (1929–1936)\nAdam Koc (1936)\nWładysław Byrka (1936–1941)\nBohdan Winiarski (1941–1946)\nEdward Drożniak (1946–1952)\n\n\n== Buildings ==\nThe Bank Polski SA operated in Warsaw from the former branch building of the State Bank of the Russian Empire, erected in 1908–1911 on a design by architect Leon Benois on the site of the former Polish mint. In 1918 that building became the seat of the Polish National Loan Fund, which the Bank Polski replaced in 1924. During Nazi occupation, it was used by the Bank of Issue. It was not reconstructed following the destructions of World War II. In the 2010s, the Senator office complex was built on the footprint of the former Bank of Poland building and incorporated some of its surviving architectonic elements.\nIn Kraków, the Polish National Loan Fund in 1921 commissioned a new building from architect Kazimierz Wyczyński, which was completed after the latter's death in 1923 by Teodor Hoffmann. That building was used in 1940–1945 as head office of the Bank of Issue in Poland. The branch building In Siedlce was similarly commissioned by the National Loan Fund and completed in 1924.\nIn other localities, the Bank of Poland repurposed former branches of the Reichsbank, as in Bydgoszcz, Katowice or Toruń, or of the Russian State Bank, as in Łódź.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nBank Polski\nList of central banks\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "James Gilbert Gerard (1795 – 31 March 1835) was a Scottish surgeon and explorer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGerard son of Gilbert Gerard, D.D, brother of Alexander and of Patrick Gerard, was born in 1795. Probably he is the ‘Gerard, Jacobus, Aberdoniensis,’ who entered the King's or Marischal College as in 1807, but there is some doubt. On 27 November 1814 he was appointed assistant-surgeon on the Bengal establishment and became surgeon 5 May 1826. He accompanied his brother Alexander in several of his Himalayan journeys, and was author of ‘Observations on the Spité Valley and the circumjacent Country within the Himalayas’ in ‘Asiat. Researches’ (1833), xviii. 238–79, and of the ‘Account of a Visit to the Shotool and Borendo Passes’ in Sir William Lloyd's book. His regimental service was chiefly in the hills with the 1st Nusseerabad battalion. In 1831 he volunteered to accompany Sir Alexander Burnes in his expedition across the Hindu Khoosh to Bokhara. Sufficient credit has not been given to Gerard for the scientific accuracy which his assistance lent to the geographical information collected by Burnes (Journ. Roy. Geog. Soc. Lond. xii. 133). From his notebooks his brother Alexander prepared a map of the return route from Herat to Peshawur. His brother writes: ‘His trip to Bokhara with Colonel Sir Alexander Burnes was a mad-like expedition for him, as he had long been unwell and was obliged to leave his bed to go, and could only travel in a palkee [palanquin]. It was … at his own particular request that Burnes applied for him. The trip killed him, for he had several attacks of fever on his way to Bokhara, and Burnes again and again urged him either to return or stop at Cabool until he recovered, but he would do neither. … On his return he was detained three months at Meshed, and no less than eight at Herat, by fever, so that on his arrival at Subathoo his constitution was completely worn out. He … gradually declined. Patrick and I were with him the whole time he survived, which was just a year, for I got leave of absence to prepare a map of the route from his notes; for he observed the bearings, estimated the distances, and noted the villages all the way from Herat to the Indus. … It was a splendid map, 10 ft. long by 3 ft. wide, on a scale of 5 in. to the mile. At my brother's dying request I presented it to Sir Charles Metcalfe, then governor-general, from whom I received a thousand thanks. The map is now [1840] with the army on the Indus, and … they have found the position of the roads wonderfully correct, considering the distances were estimated by time and the bearings taken with a small pocket-compass.’ Gerard died at Subathoo 31 March 1835.\nThe German geographer, Carl Ritter, has noticed the valuable services rendered by the three brothers Gerard to the cause of geographical science (Ritter, Der Erdkunde von Asien (1829), Band ii. S. 546).\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Chichester, Henry Manners (1890). \"Gerard, James Gilbert\". In Stephen, Leslie (ed.).

The Federation of Southern Cooperatives (FSC) was formed in 1967 to connect Black farming co-ops across the Southern United States.  In 1971, the FSC purchased 73 acres (30 ha) near Epes, Alabama, to serve as a training center and headquarters.  The property already had a pond, pump house, and a one-story wood frame & masonry building constructed as a hunting cabin, all built circa 1945, and a circa 1960 barn.  The FSC renovated the house into offices, and also constructed a print shop, dormitory, office, and cafeteria/auditorium, all in 1972.\nThe farm was listed on the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage in 2021 and the National Register of Historic Places in 2023.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was published from August 29, 1910, until August 30, 1945.\nIt was published almost every day throughout the colonial period. It published around 10,000 issues total, containing 130,000 pages and 200 million characters. It contained information on a variety of topics, including business transactions, administrative activities, the results of surveys or studies, current affairs, and changes in colonial government personnel. It is now considered a highly valuable resource for studying the 1910–1945 Japanese colonial period.\nAn archive of the publication is available online for free, courtesy of the National Institute of Korean History. The archive has been transcribed, and is searchable and indexed.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of newspapers in Korea (includes Japanese newspapers)\nHistory of newspapers in Korea\nCategory:Japanese-language newspapers published in Korea\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOnline archives (website in Korean)",

        "content": "The 4th United States Colored Cavalry Regiment was an African American cavalry regiment that served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. The regiment mustered in as the 1st Cavalry (Corps d'Afrique) at New Orleans on September 12, 1863 and was stationed for the entirety of its existence at various bases throughout Louisiana, mustering out at New Orleans on March 20, 1866. \n\n\n== 1st Cavalry, Corps d'Afrique ==\n\n\n=== Organization ===\n\nThe Corps d'Afrique was created on May 1, 1863, by Major General Nathaniel P. Banks, who replaced Major General Benjamin F. Butler as commander of the Department of the Gulf, to organize an army corps of infantry, cavalry and artillery regiments composed entirely of colored troops. All of the officers, however, would be white. As a part of that plan, the 1st Cavalry (Corps d'Afrique) was organized at New Orleans, Louisiana, and mustered in on September 12, 1863, for three years' service. The regiment was composed primarily of freedmen from other states and areas of Louisiana not under Union control and escaped slaves from the New Orleans area (since New Orleans and its surrounding parishes were under Union control, those areas were not subject to the Emancipation Proclamation). The regiment underwent cavalry training at the Cavalry Camp of Instruction at Greenville, Louisiana and was then moved to Camp Parapet, just north of New Orleans.\nThe first commander assigned to the regiment was Colonel James Grant Wilson, formerly of the 15th Illinois Cavalry, who served simultaneously as the aide-de-camp to Major General Banks and never assumed operational control of the regiment. The first operational commander of the regiment was Lieutenant Colonel Julius H. Alexander, formerly of the 7th Kentucky Cavalry. The company commanders were primarily  from other cavalry units in the North, and some had already seen combat action prior to receiving commissions in the 1st. At least two company-grade officers who accepted provisional commissions into the 1st were eventually not mustered into the unit; one of these officers was Captain P. B. S. Pinchback, who previously served in the 1st and 2nd Louisiana Native Guard.\nSome of the officers assigned to the 1st would accompany other units and recruit on behalf of the 1st. For example, Company F was composed of freedmen from the New Iberia area during the second Bayou Teche campaign in October 1863 and was originally to be a mounted infantry unit called the Mounted Rangers (Corps d'Afrique). Company H was composed of freedmen recruited by Captain Franz Beuter after the Union occupation of Indianola, Texas in late 1863 and early 1864. Recruiting efforts by Major Joseph W. Paine, formerly of the 13th New York Cavalry, during the Red River campaign in April 1864 resulted in the formation of Company I (mostly freedmen from Grand Ecore, northwest of Natchitoches) and companies K, L, and M (all composed of freedmen mainly from Alexandria). \nUnfortunately, the recruiting work could be dangerous. On March 22, 1864, while accompanying a XIX Corps movement to Alexandria during the Red River campaign, Second Lieutenant William Hamblin, formerly of the 3rd Massachusetts Cavalry, was captured by Confederate guerrillas near Washington, Louisiana, north of Opelousas. Listed as a prisoner of war, Hamblin was taken to a Confederate prison camp in Opelousas and was thought to haven been taken from Opelousas to a Confederate prison camp in Tyler, Texas. He never made it to Tyler; Hamblin was executed in Opelousas by a Confederate firing squad. Later that same month, a soldier accompanying Major Paine was wounded in an engagement while on picket duty outside of Alexandria. \n\n\n=== Service ===\nThe regiment was initially assigned to the Defences of New Orleans and stationed at various New Orleans-area bases including Camp Colfax (Carrollton), Camp Parapet (Jefferson), and Fort Butler (Donaldsonville). Their service was primarily menial labor and garrison duty at Camp Parapet. However, in October 1863, a detachment of companies A and C was detailed to Company Canal (near present-day Westwego) to protect the New Orleans & Opelousas Railroad.\nOn April 4, 1864, the  Corps d'Afrique was placed under the United States Colored Troops, and the 1st Cavalry, Corps d'Afrique was redesignated as the 4th United States Colored Cavalry.\n\n\n== 4th U.S. Colored Cavalry ==\n\n\n=== 1864 ===\n \nOn June 11, 1864, a battalion of the 4th was sent to New Orleans to participate in the Emancipation Jubilee, which celebrated the ratification of the State Constitution of 1864 that abolished slavery throughout Louisiana, including in the thirteen parishes exempted in the Emancipation Proclamation. Though unmounted and their weapons unloaded, the 4th led the procession, which included social, civic, religious, abolitionist and benevolent groups. In the procession was the family of Captain Andre Cailloux, the Louisiana Native Guard officer who was killed in the Siege of Port Hudson.\nIn July 1864, companies A and K were detached to provide pickets for the New Orleans & Jackson Railroad, which ran through Camp Parapet. In addition to guarding against use of the railroad by Confederate forces, the pickets were also protecting the 7th U.S. Colored Heavy Artillery, which were adding heavy cannons at Pass Manchac.  The remainder of the regiment underwent training at the Cavalry Camp of Instruction in Greenville. Because the regiment was still unmounted, the training used the infantry training manuals written by Major General Silas Casey. \nOn August 8, 1864, the 4th was relieved from duty under the Defences of New Orleans and transferred from Camp Parapet to Port Hudson under the U.S. Forces at Port Hudson, relieving the 2nd Louisiana Mounted Infantry and placing a much-requested dedicated cavalry presence at Port Hudson. While at Port Hudson, the regiment began the process of being mounted, with the 4th reported as having 325 horses by August 22, 1864. With the regiment's focus now back to mounted cavalry, such weapons as the Remington Model 1858 revolver and the Burnside carbine was issued to the regiment's soldiers. \nAs the 4th was still being fully mounted, the regiment participated in an expedition to Clinton, Louisiana from August 23–29, 1864 to flush out Confederate jayhawkers based there. While on that expedition, the regiment saw combat action on August 25 at Olive Branch, on the Comite River about ten miles south of Clinton, resulting in one soldier wounded. Though this is the only recorded official combat engagement involving the 4th, the regiment sporadically engaged small units while on picket duty at various locations. Upon his medical discharge in November 1864 as a result of adverse effects of a gunshot wound, regiment commander Lieutenant Colonel Julius H. Alexander was replaced by Major Nathaniel C. Mitchell, formerly of the 15th Illinois Cavalry.\n\n\n=== 1865 and 1866 ===\nOn January 28, 1865, the 4th underwent a reorganization that saw companies I, K, L, and M absorbed into, respectively, companies H, D, B, and E, reducing the number of companies in the regiment from twelve to eight. On March 27, 1865, regiment commander Major Nathaniel Mitchell was promoted to lieutenant colonel; he would continue to command the 4th. The 4th went on an expedition from Port Hudson to Jackson, Louisiana from April 11–13, 1865 to escort an engineering team repairing telegraph lines. Simultaneously, a battalion of the 4th escorted another telegraph repair team from Port Hudson to Osyka, Mississippi. The battalion left Port Hudson on April 12 and arrived at Osyka on April 17. Using the repaired telegraph line, the 4th confirmed to the Confederate forces at Osyka that General Robert E. Lee had already surrendered the Army of Northern Virginia on April 9.\nThe 4th would remain stationed at Port Hudson until July 1865, when the regiment was placed in field service. Now tasked with providing peacekeeping duties during the Reconstruction era, detachments of the regiment would serve at various points throughout Louisiana, including Baton Rouge (companies C and H), Bayou Sara (companies A and B), Monroe and Vidalia (companies D and E) until December 1865, when the regiment was ordered to Baton Rouge and then to Greenville. The regiment mustered out at Greenville on March 20, 1866.\n\n\n== Casualties ==\nThe regiment lost a total of 180 soldiers. 114 soldiers, including one officer, died of disease; the leading cause of death in the regiment was dysentery, which killed 43 soldiers. The death certificates of 35 soldiers either listed their cause of death as unknown or no cause of death was listed. Four soldiers died of gunshot wounds (one shot by a provost guard, one shot by a civilian, possibly a plantation owner, and two accidental shootings), three soldiers drowned in the Mississippi River and one soldier was struck by lightning. Officially, the regiment suffered one combat casualty, which was one private that was wounded at Olive Branch on August 25, 1864.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of United States Colored Troops Civil War units\nLouisiana in the American Civil War\nUnited States Colored Troops\n\n\n== References ==\n\nAttribution\n This article contains text from a text now in the public domain: Dyer, Frederick H.

        "content": "The evolution of the rate for sending a letter to France at the first weight level can be studied from 1848 to the present day.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== From 1848 to 1945 ===\nIn 1848, the French Post Office launched the printing of a 20 centime stamp in black and a 1 franc stamp in red.\nBetween 1849 and 1920, the Post Office's rate for the first weight step was relatively stable between 10 and 40 centimes de franc for 15 grams.\nIn the interwar period, postal prices rose steadily from 25 centimes in 1920 to 1 franc in 1939.\n\n\n=== From 1945 to 1975 ===\nAfter the Second World War, the price of a letter weighing less than 20 grams rose from 3 francs in 1946 to 25 francs in 1959.With the new franc, the domestic rate rose from 25 centimes in 1960 to 40 centimes in 1969.\n\n\n=== From 1975 to 2015 ===\nFor some forty years, the price of a stamp for a letter weighing less than 20 grams remained stable, equivalent to 60 and 70 euro cents in 2022.\nDuring the 1970s, the domestic rate for a 20-gram letter rose from 80 centimes to 1.40 francs in 1980.\nBetween 1983 and 2017, the priority rate increased by 3.06% per year. Since the changeover to the euro in 2001 and until 2017, the same rate has increased by an average of 3.91% per year. In comparison, between 1991 and 2014, inflation in France averaged 1.59% per year.It's worth noting: Fare increases did not keep pace with inflation in the 1980s. Since then, increases have generally been higher than the rate of inflation.\n\n\n=== Since 2015 ===\nFrom January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2018, rate increases are governed by a four-year agreement, which limits the increase to 3.5% on top of inflation. However, in October 2017, ARCEP authorized La Poste to override the initial agreement.In January 2017, La Poste explained that the highest increases of the 2010s were decided \"to ensure the sustainability of the universal service in a context of declining mail volumes\". However, UFC denounced these increases, in the words of its president, who felt that they acted \"as a repellent\" and that they were precipitating the end of low value-added service.\n\n\n== Pricing trends from 1960 to 2022 ==\n\n\n=== Graphical representation ===\nIn 1984, Jean Fourastié, well known for his work on prices,  productivity and technical progress, highlighted the value of having a vision of price trends free from currency variations by introducing the notions of current and constant prices.The current price is recorded in the current currency at a specific location and date. These are called nominal prices. The constant price is the price in real terms corrected for price changes relative to a base or reference date.\n\n\n==== Data 1983-present La Poste tariffs for red and green stamps from 1983 to 2024 ====\nThe table below does not refer to every year since 1983: percentage increases are calculated concerning the line immediately below and are therefore not necessarily annual increases.\n\n\n=== Since 2023 ===\nOn January 1, 2023, La Poste abolished the J+4 ecopli rate and the J+1 red stamp, and switched to digital letters. New turquoise stamp (D+2 at €2.95, including tracking notifications).The price is €1.49 for a 3-sheet E-letter, and €1.16 for a letter delivered on D+3.\n\n\n== See also ==\nJean Fourastié\nLa Poste (France)\nFrench franc\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Samuel Derham (1655 – 26 August 1689) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nDerham was born in 1655 at Weston, near Campden, Gloucestershire, being the son of William Derham of that place. He entered as a student of Magdalen Hall, Oxford, in Michaelmas term 1672, when he was seventeen years old. He took the degree of B.A. on 13 June 1676, that of M.A. on 3 May 1679, was made M.B. on 9 Feb. 1681, and passed M.D. on 18 Jan. 1687. He began the practice of medicine before he attained to the last-named honour, and in 1685 distinguished himself by publishing an account of the chalybeate waters at Ilmington in Warwickshire, which he strongly and successfully recommended as a cure for scrofulous complaints. The place became in consequence a fashionable health resort, and Lord Capell, the landowner there, encouraged visitors by presenting the land surrounding the well to the public. Derham seemed on the way to eminence in his profession when he was suddenly cut off, in the prime of his life, by small-pox, dying in his house at Oxford on 26 August 1689. He was buried in his parish church, St. Michael's, at the upper end of the north chancel.\nThe title of the book he published is: ‘Hydrologia Philosophica; or, an Account of Ilmington Waters in Warwickshire, with directions for drinking of the same,’ 8vo, Oxford, 1685. Annexed to this publication is a treatise entitled ‘Experimental Observations touching the original of Compound Bodies.’\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Harrison, Robert (1888). \"Derham, Samuel\".

        "content": "Jonah Peter Nimoy is an American musician best known as the current multi-instrumentalist for the American punk rock band the Offspring.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nNimoy was born and raised in Los Angeles as the son of actor Adam Nimoy. He began playing drums at the age of seven after relentlessly watching a VHS tape of The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus. Soon after, he received a drum set and started playing in his garage for hours, trying to learn the entire \"Moby Dick\" solo or any Ginger Baker motif. Nimoy was also interested in guitar, but his hands were too small to hold a chord. In those early years, his dad would jump on guitar and with him on drums, followed by the occasional guest vocal appearance made by his mother. Not long after, Nimoy was starting bands with friends at school, where he would soon discover his love of punk and metal music. Through his high school years, he would play in a metal band called Brutal Force.\nWhen the band was over, Nimoy dropped out of high school. After a short-lived stint as a drum salesman, Nimoy decided to go back to school. After he graduated, he spent the next few years gigging with his metal band Legal Tender, as well as other various projects in which he sang and played guitar. Soon after making these occasional instrumental switches, he became a full-time frontman, guitar player, singer, and drummer.\nIn August 2017, he toured with the Offspring, filling in for Todd Morse who was filling in for lead guitarist Noodles. In 2019, Nimoy became the rhythm guitarist for the band on tours to replace Morse (who became the band's new bassist after the departure of founding bassist Greg K.). Nimoy later also started playing keyboards and percussion. In 2023, Nimoy played on \"Suit of Armor\", a song by Offspring bandmate Todd Morse.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nNimoy is the son of actor Adam Nimoy and grandson of Leonard Nimoy, who is known for his portrayal of Spock in the original Star Trek series and movies.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Fire\" is a 2021 single released by Scottish singer Amy Macdonald from her fifth studio album The Human Demands (2021). It was released in December 2020 as the albums third single via both Infectious Music and BMG.\n\n\n== Background ==\nMacdonald wrote \"Fire\" as the first song following her marriage to footballer Richard Foster in Las Vegas. Macdonald said of the song \"I was co-writing with a friend Matt Jones, and we had the song finished in half an hour. I was so happy at the time, just married, that I came up with something that isn’t typical of me at all. I said to my husband: this is the only song you’ll ever get out of me, so enjoy it\". The song has been described by Gabby Smith in House of Solo Magazine as displaying a \"softer side\" to Macdonald and her songwriting, claiming \"melted by marriage, the track is a heartfelt homage to her husband and remains one of the most romantic pieces ever written by the acoustic guitar-playing indie rocker. Displaying her impressive vocals and impeccable talents, staccato guitar riffs elevate the love song for a pleasant pop-rock feel\".\nDuring a release party stream on her official YouTube channel, Macdonald said of the song \"Fire is about those special relationships we have in our lives. The people who make us tick and we can fully be ourselves when we're around them. What would life be without them?\".\n\n\n== Release and reception ==\nThe song was released as the third single from Macdonald's fifth studio album, The Human Demands (2020). \"Fire\" was released internationally in December 2020 via Infectious Music and BMG. The Scotsman claims that with \"Fire\", Macdonald has \"let down her well-maintained guard sufficiently to include a song she says is wholly personal\", later claiming that \"this slick, chiming AOR number on the kindling of emotions is general enough not to reveal much\".\n\"Fire\" has been described as a song which \"quickly takes flight\" as the opening track on The Human Demands. It has been described as a song with \"calm, mood-setting intro, it unfolds to become a widescreen indie-Americana anthem which captures the latest evolution in Amy’s sound. Its optimistic atmosphere is matched by its lyrics, which celebrate the power of commitment while also opening up the vulnerabilities that come with it\". \n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe music video for \"Fire\" was directed by Jackson Ducasse. The synopsis for the music video sees two friends, who live on the same estate, be frustrated by the various situations they find themselves in throughout daily life, with \"one being hindered by a strained relationship with her mother after the loss of her father, while the other is on the verge of losing her dead-end job\". Both friends appear to \"make a rush for freedom\". It has been said that \"the inspiration and redemptive narrative is captured with a gritty yet elegant aesthetic that recalls the work of acclaimed Scottish filmmakers Andrea Arnold (‘Fish Tank’) and Lynne Ramsay (‘Morvern Callar’).\"\nThe videos director, Jackson Ducasse, claimed that \"even though Fire is ostensibly a love song, I felt it was just as appropriate to create a narrative about female friendship for this video. It’s been a tough year (due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic) but friendship is one of the things that’s made this time bearable for so many of us. So this video is really a love letter to the power of friendship. Working with Amy is a dream, she’s a brilliant performer and her songwriting and vocals are so powerful. It’s been a great privilege and pleasure to collaborate with her on this video.\"\nThe music video was uploaded to Macdonald's official YouTube channel on 4 December 2020, and has of March 2024, has generated over one million views.\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\n\"Fire\" failed to make an appearance on any chart internationally. As of March 2024, it has been streamed over two million times of streaming service Spotify.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Bite Down is a 2024 studio album by American indie rock musician Rosali, released by Merge Records. It has received positive reviews from critics.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nEditors at AllMusic rated this album 4.5 out of 5 stars, with critic Fred Thomas writing that on this album, \"Rosali offers the best examples yet of her peculiar ability to craft songs that sound uncannily at peace as they explode, and to sing about time-halting vulnerabilities in a calm, almost relaxed voice... one that communicates full-hearted intensity without ever resorting to heavy-handedness or overstatement\". Online retailer Bandcamp chose this as Album of the Day, where reviewer Marian Timony emphasized the strength of Rosali's collaborations on what she called \"one of 2024’s most remarkable records, arriving fully-formed with songs lightly blending a smooth and poppy style of inward-looking yet universal singer-songwriter fare and cosmically-inclined free-form rock experimentalism\". Writing for Paste, Ben Salmon rated Bite Down an 8.5 out of 10, calling it \"packed wall to wall with tunes that are unsettled but unhurried, generous with melody, wandering but never lost, and reliably steady despite the never-ending twists and turns of an earthly existence\". In The Shepherd Express, John M. Gilbertson called this album \"a reminder that the difference [between alternative country and mainstream country] still has meaning\" and compared Rosali's vocals to Margo Timmins of Cowboy Junkies. Editors at Stereogum chose Bite Down as Album of the Week, where critic Chris DeVille called it \"a folk rock album that actually rocks\" and \"one of the most stirring albums of this young year\". Steven Hyden at Uproxx also dubbed this one of the best albums of the year, calling it a \"real achievement\" that sounds like it was \"created by a gang of likeminded individuals expressing something authentic and true together\"\nPrior to the album's release, Boutanye Chokrane reviewed the title track for Pitchfork Media, characterizing it as \"like going under anesthesia: disorientating at first until the mind drifts into blissful detachment\" and comparing it to Aimee Mann's \"Lost in Space\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll songs written by Rosali\n\n\"On Tonight\" – 4:18\n\"Rewind\" – 4:49\n\"Hills on Fire\" – 5:13\n\"My Kind\" – 3:46\n\"Bite Down\" – 4:28\n\"Hopeless\" – 3:45\n\"Slow Pain\" – 4:50\n\"Is It Too Late\" – 3:47\n\"Change Is in the Form\" – 4:07\n\"May It Be on Offer\" – 5:44\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n2024 in American music\nList of 2024 albums\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nBite Down at MusicBrainz (list of releases)",

        "content": "Canada's Ultimate Challenge is a Canadian reality television series, which premiered in February 2023 on CBC Television. The series, touted as a cross-national \"obstacle course\", features teams of Canadians competing in various physical challenges, such as whitewater rafting or rock climbing, at various locations throughout Canada, until the ultimate winning team is chosen.\nThe first season was hosted by Craig McMorris and Nikki Reyes, and featured the teams being coached by prominent Canadian athletes including Donovan Bailey, Waneek Horn-Miller, Clara Hughes, Gilmore Junio, Jen Kish and Luke Willson. The prize, including a trip to Paris for the 2024 Summer Olympics, was won by Team Black, consisting of Vinny Rojas of Dorval, Quebec, Alana Warnick of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Bradley Farquhar of Halifax, Nova Scotia, and Devon MD Jones of Toronto, Ontario. A second season is slated to premiere in 2024 with host Brandon Gonez, dropping the celebrity coaches to centre on players having to navigate the challenges themselves.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCanada's Ultimate Challenge at IMDb",

Passed on the same day as the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863, the Suppression of Rebellion Act was passed in response to Māori rebelling against the New Zealand Government's seizure of land throughout the New Zealand Wars.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Richard van Zwol (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈriɕɑrt vɑn zʋɔl]; born 8 February 1965) is a Dutch civil servant who has been a member of the Council of State since 2017. He led three government ministries as secretary general: General Affairs (2007–2011), Finance (2011–2013) and Interior and Kingdom Relations (2013–2017). A member of the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), Van Zwol has been involved in several cabinet formations.\n\n\n== Career ==\nVan Zwol studied legal public administration and public finance at Tilburg University. He was a close advisor to prime ministers Wim Kok, Jan Peter Balkenende, and Mark Rutte, leading newspaper NRC to call him a \"hidden force of the Dutch government\". He helped write the coalition agreement of the first Kok cabinet in 1994, reportedly due to him being the only civil servant with proficiency in the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet editor. Starting in 2007, Van Zwol consecutively served as secretary general of the Ministries of General Affairs, of Finance, and of the Interior and Kingdom Relations. He is a member of the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), and he was involved in the formation of the second, third, and fourth Balkenende cabinets as secretary.\nHe became a state councilor at the advisory division of the Council of State in October 2017. Concurrently, he served as chair of the CDA's think tank between 2018 and 2022, and he investigated the CDA's loss of seats in the 2021 general election. Van Zwol has argued that the rule of law and local governments would have to be strengthened to heal the relationship between the government and citizens. He has also stressed the importance of a service-oriented government. Van Zwol chairs the supervisory board of the Dutch branch of accounting firm EY, and he led the State Commission on Demographic Developments 2050, which published its conclusions in January 2024. It advised the Dutch government to reduce migration while still preventing a population decline.\nAs part of the 2023–2024 Dutch cabinet formation, Van Zwol was selected by PVV leader Geert Wilders to serve as informateur alongside Elbert Dijkgraaf. They were tasked with investigating a governing coalition with a concise agreement between the PVV, VVD, NSC, and BBB as recommended by their predecessor Kim Putters within eight weeks.\n\n\n== References ==",

After her first studio album, Pureza (2021), Lahoz went on a tour of more than eighty shows throughout the Iberian Peninsula that continued the following year by adding international concerts in Europe and the United States. In 2023, she was one of seven winners of the Music Moves Europe Award that honor emerging artists.

        "content": "Arthur James Lomax v. Christina Ortiz-Marquez et al., 590 U.S. ___ (2020) was a Supreme Court case in which the court held that in situations and proceedings in which a prisoner is filing to proceed In forma pauperis, as it pertains to the \"3 strikes\" system set out in 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g), a dismissal without prejudice counts for failure to state a claim counts as a \"strike. The court held this in a unanimous decision, although interestingly Justice Thomas joined the majority in all but Footnote 4 of the opinion.\n\n\n== Historical Context ==\n\n\n=== Colorado Courts ===\nArthur James Lomax was tried in Colorado and convicted by a jury in 2006 for sexual assault, unlawful sexual contact, and misdemeanor sexual assault. The Colorado judge in that case sentenced Lomax to six years to life for sexual assault, and a one-year concurrent sentence for the other two counts. Lomax immediately appealed to the Colorado Court of Appeals, which vacated the sexual contact charge but affirmed the other two counts. Lomax then petitioned for a Writ of Certiorari to the Colorado Supreme Court which was denied on March 8, 2010. After several more appeals, Lomax finally appealed to the U.S. District Court for Colorado, which on March 1, 2012, promptly rejected all of his claims and denied his request for a Certificate of appealability based on the timeliness of Lomax's appeal.\n\n\n=== U.S. District Courts ===\nLomax then proceeded to file the first of three lawsuits, first in Lomax v. AVCF Ivette Ruiz et al., 1:13-cv-00707, (D. Colo.) against several officials of the Arkansas Valley Correctional Facility ('AVCF') and of the Fremont Correctional Facility ('FCF'), but was dismissed on the basis of Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994), secondly in Lomax v. Hoffman et al., 1:13-cv-02131, (D. Colo.) against the judge who tried his case, but was also dismissed based on Heck, and thirdly, in Lomax v. Hoffman et al., 1:13-cv-03296, (D. Colo.) again against his judge and former Colorado Department of Corrections executive director Rick Raemisch.\nThese three cases culminated into Lomax's next suit in Lomax v. Raemisch et al., 1:18-cv-00321, (D. Colo.), where the District Court rejected his request to proceed in forma pauperis on November 13, 2018. The name of Ortiz-Marquez comes from a prison official from Lomax's last lawsuit. Lomax appealed, but lost his appeal once more, at which point he finally appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\n\n== Supreme Court Decision ==\nOn October 18, 2019, the Supreme Court granted Lomax's petition for certiorari, held oral arguments on February 26, 2020, and announced its decision on June 8, 2020. In a unanimous decision the Supreme Court ruled in favor for Marquez. \n\nJustice Elena Kagan wrote the majority, in which all Justices joined, except Justice Clarence Thomas in Footnote 4 of the majority opinion. The context behind Footnote 4 reads as follows: \"This case begins, and pretty much ends, with the text of Section 1915(g). Under that provision, a prisoner accrues a strike for any action “dismissed on the ground[] that it . . . fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.” That broad language covers all such dismissals: It applies to those issued both with and without prejudice to a plaintiff ’s ability to reassert his claim in a later action.4\" Footnote 4 itself read as follows:4. Note, however, that the provision does not apply when a court gives a plaintiff leave to amend his complaint. Courts often take that path if there is a chance that amendment can cure a deficient complaint. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15(a) (discussing amendments to pleadings). In that event, because the suit continues, the court’s action falls outside of Section 1915(g) and no strike accrues. See Brief for Respondents 31–35 (noting that flexible amendment practices “ensure that potentially meritorious prisoner suits are not hastily dismissed with a strike”); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 27–28 (similar); Tr. of Oral Arg. 32–34, 44 (similar). The decision seemed to have been very easy for the Court, with the opinion sounding sort of informal, and the court essentially refuted all of Lomax's claims. The Court seemed to have only taken the case to resolve a circuit split,  which was reinforced by the majority opinion saying,\"The Courts of Appeals have long divided over whether a dismissal without prejudice for failure to state a claim qualifies as a strike under Section 1915(g).3 In line with our duty to call balls and strikes, we granted certiorari to resolve the split, 589 U. S. ___ (2019), and we now affirm.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "SS Aguila was a British merchant steamship that was built in Scotland in 1909. She was one of a small fleet of ships that Yeoward Brothers ran between Liverpool and the Canary Islands, importing fruit to Britain, and carrying passengers in both directions. A U-boat sank her in 1915.\nThis was the first of two Yeoward Brothers ships that were named Aguila. The second Aguila was launched in 1916, and sunk by a U-boat in 1941.\n\n\n== Building and identification ==\nThe Caledon Shipbuilding & Engineering Company in Dundee built Aguila as yard number 209. She was launched on 6 May 1909 and completed that July. Her registered length was 275.4 ft (83.9 m), her beam was 38.0 ft (11.6 m), and her depth was 17.0 ft (5.2 m). Her tonnages were 2,114 GRT and 1,204 NRT. She had a single screw, driven by a three-cylinder triple-expansion engine that was rated at 278 NHP.\nYeoward Brothers registered Aguila at Liverpool. Her United Kingdom official number was 127986, and her code letters were HPKF. The Aguila Steam Ship Company owned her. This was a one-ship company controlled by Yeoward Brothers. By 1914 she was equipped with wireless telegraphy. Her call sign was GFF.\n\n\n== Loss ==\nOn 27 March 1915 Aguila was en route from Liverpool to the Canaries. At about 17:30 hrs U-28 intercepted her in St George's Channel and signalled her to stop. Aguila made full speed to try to escape. U-28 overhauled her and opened fire with her deck gun. Aguila hove to, and her crew and passengers abandoned ship on four lifeboats. U-28 continued to shell the ship as the boats were being launched, and then fired one torpedo, which sank her 47 nautical miles (87 km) southwest of the Smalls Lighthouse.\nSix members of Aguila's complement were killed, including her Chief Engineer and a stewardess. Two passengers were also killed, and several crew members were wounded. U-28 hailed a trawler, Ottilie, and told its crew about the survivors in the four lifeboats. Ottilie found three of the boats, and landed them at Fishguard. Some hours later another trawler, St. Stephen, found the fourth boat, and landed survivors at Milford Haven.\nThe next day, U-28 torpedoed Falaba in the same area, killing more than 100 people.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nLloyd's Register of British and Foreign Shipping.

        "content": "James Thomas Brenna (born October 15, 1959) is an American scientist specializing in analytical chemistry, and in human nutrition and foods, specifically fats. He is a professor of Paediatrics at Dell Medical School, having previously been a professor of human nutrition, chemistry, chemical biology and food science at Cornell University.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Floyd Landis trials ===\nBrenna was the key expert witness in the action of the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) against 2006 Tour de France first place finisher Floyd Landis, adjudicated in a hearing of the Tribunal Arbitral du Sport/Court for Arbitration in Sport held in Malibu, California. He testified to the accuracy of Carbon Isotope Ratio (CIR) tests conducted by the French Antidoping laboratory at Châtenay-Malabry. Landis conducted a high profile, multimillion dollar defense but lost the 2007 original hearing  with the decision relying for technical opinion on Brenna’s testimony. Landis later lost a 2008 de novo case before the American Arbitration Association also relying on Brenna’s testimony and was stripped of his title. Years later Landis revealed he was doping and filed a whistle-blower lawsuit under the federal False Claims Act against Lance Armstrong that was settled with multimillion dollar payments by Armstrong.\n\n\n=== DHA in Infant Formula ===\nBrenna visited the FDA infant formula team in late 2001 to encourage omega-3 DHA to be included in infant formula. A few weeks later the FDA issued its “no questions” letter accepting this suggestion and citing his work.\n\n\n=== Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee ===\nBrenna was a member of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee advising on the 2015 U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans. He was one of four members of the Food Sustainability and Safety subcommittee whose work on sustainability was excluded from consideration by an act of Congress.\n\n\n=== Coconut oil ===\nComments in the New York Times about the healthfulness of coconut oil in late 2015 were covered in 200+ newspapers globally. Brenna opined that 21th century virgin coconut oil does not cause heart disease but that earlier coconut oils may cause heart disease due to process contaminants.\n\n\n=== Vegetarian gene ===\nIn 2016 he was co-lead of a team that discovered an insertion-deletion polymorphism, rs66698963, is under positive selective pressure depending on whether ancestral diets were primarily animal/seafood-based or plant-based. Global news widely reported that it would lead to potentially greater risk of disease, though this was corrected later.\n\n\n== References ==",

The specimen was not discovered until the block was CT scanned as part of the redescription of the small reptile Elachistosuchus in 2015.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe species is only known from a skull and partial lower jaws. The skull has been compressed during fossilization. The specimen is thought to be a juvenile, as it has relatively large eyes and is small in size, with the skull only being around 1.6 centimetres (0.63 in) in length, comparable to that of Diphydontosaurus. The dentition is very similar to that of Diphydontosaurus.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nParvosaurus was placed as a basal sphenodontian by its describers, more derived than Diphydontosaurus but less derived than Planocephalosaurus:\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Buckie Lifeboat Station is located in the town of Buckie, Moray, on the Moray Firth coast of NE Scotland. A lifeboat was first stationed here by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in 1860.\nSince 2003, the station has operated a Severn-class All-weather lifeboat, 17-37\tWilliam Blannin (ON 1268).\n\n\n== History ==\nA request in February 1860 from Commander McDonald, Inspector of H.M. Coastguard, that a lifeboat be placed at Buckie, was considered and accepted by the RNLI Committee of Management, and was formally agreed on 5 April 1860. An order for a lifeboat was placed with Forrestt of Limehouse, London, who constructed a 30-foot Peake type 6-oared self-righting lifeboat, and a boathouse was commissioned. The lifeboat, which was named Miriam, arrived by rail on 10 November 1860.\nMiriam was only launched 3 times on service, but she is also recorded to have saved 49 lives over those 3 occasions. She was converted to be a 10-oared boat in 1866, but by 1870, the RNLI had decided to replace her with a larger 33-foot lifeboat.\nA new boat was ordered, again from Forrestt of London, at a cost of £277-17s-6d. It was transported free of charge by the North Eastern, Caledonian and Great North of Scotland railway companies. The boat arrived in Portsoy on 25 January 1871, from where it was pulled on a carriage by a team of horses 10 miles to Buckie, to be greeted by 3000 people. Two bands joined the procession down to the boathouse, where the boat was named James Sturm, to recognise the legacy of Mr. James Sturm of Holborn.\n\nAs part of the ongoing redevelopment of Buckie harbour, the RNLI were contacted by the Great North of Scotland railway company in 1883, who wished to extend their lines, and needed the land where the 1860 boathouse stood. A deal was struck, and the boathouse and land were sold for just over £121. A new boathouse (shown right) was constructed on Low Street in 1885, costing £447-19s-0d, but it is not known if this was paid by the RNLI, or the gift of the railway company.\nBuckie received their first powered lifeboat in 1922, a 40ft Watson-class non-self-righting lifeboat, with a single 45 h.p. engine, giving a speed of 7.36 kts. She was named K. B. M. (ON 681) in recognition of her late benefactors, Mr. William Kirkhope, Mr Charles Bailey, and Miss Charlotte McInroy. This boat required the construction of a new boathouse, and it was one of only two built of this design, the other one being at Sunderland. With insufficient room for a conventional slipway, the boathouse was built over the water, and utilised an internal boat platform, which could be lowered down to the water underneath.\nThe 1922 boathouse was used until 1984, when Buckie received an Arun-class lifeboat, 52-27 Charles Brown (ON 1093), which was moored afloat. Further works were carried out to create new crew facilities in 1995, and a pontoon berth was constructed, which is now home to Severn-class lifeboat, 17-37 William Blannin (ON 1268).\nIn 2018, the recently restored 47ft Watson-class lifeboat Laura Moncur (ON 958) made a return trip to her old station, 34 years after she last departed, and received an emotional reception from her former crew members.\n\n\n== Notable rescues ==\nIn the very early hours of 21 February 1968, relief lifeboat George and Sarah Strachan (ON 749) was launched to the aid of fishing boat Mistletoe, aground at the mouth of the River Spey. The boat was found close to the beach, in heavy swell and pounding waves. Working in dark and freezing conditions, attempts to get a tow-line in place failed, so Coxswain Jappy skillfully brought the lifeboat alongside, and all 6 crew were rescued. They were given rum and hot drinks, and landed in Buckie just before 5am.For this service, Coxswain George Alexander Jappy was awarded the RNLI Bronze Medal, with the crew being awarded Medal Service Certificates.\n\n\n== Station honours ==\nThe following are awards made at Buckie\n\nRNLI Silver Medal\nPeter Fernie, Fisherman - 1890\nWilliam Raich, Fisherman - 1890\nRNLI Bronze Medal\nGeorge Alexander Jappy, Coxswain - 1968\nMedal Service Certificates\nBuckie Lifeboat Crew - 1968\nThe Thanks of the Institution inscribed on Vellum\nJames Gale, Coxswain - 1868\nFrancis Mair, Coxswain - 1942\nGeorge Jappy, Coxswain - 1967\nA Framed Letter of Thanks signed by the Chairman of the Institution\nJohn Murray, Coxswain - 1987\nKenneth Farquhar, Acting Second Coxswain - 1987\nGeorge Stewart, Motor Mechanic - 1987\nPhilip Latchem, crew member - 1987\nGordon Lawtie, crew member - 1987\nSteven Matheson, crew member - 1987\nJohn Murray, Coxswain - 1991\nPlaque of Merit, awarded by the Swedish Lifeboat Society\nRoyal National Lifeboat Institution - 1949\nA Diploma, awarded by the Swedish Lifeboat Society\nBuckie Lifeboat Station - 1949\nBritish Empire Medal\nJohn Cole, Motor Mechanic - 1974\n\n\n== Buckie lifeboats ==\n\n\n=== All-weather lifeboats ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of RNLI stations\nRoyal National Lifeboat Institution\nRoyal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboats\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRNLI station information",

        "content": "James Solas Dodd (1721–1805) was an English surgeon, lecturer, and actor.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nDodd was born in London in 1721. His maternal grandfather, John Dodd, who had been ‘master in the navy during Queen Anne's wars,’ was in 1719 commander of the St. Quintin, a merchantman trading from London to Barcelona. At Barcelona he became acquainted with a young Spanish officer named Don Jago Mendozo Vasconcellos de Solis, a younger brother of Don Antonio de Solis, author of ‘Historia de la Conquista de Mexico.’ Don Jago having had a duel with the son of the governor of Barcelona, and left him for dead, took shelter in Captain Dodd's ship, and sailed in it for London that very evening. Don Jago put up at Captain Dodd's house ‘whilst his pardon was soliciting from the king of Spain,’ and in 1720 married Miss Rebecca Dodd, daughter of his host. On his marriage Don Jago took the name of Dodd in order to perpetuate to his issue a small estate near Newcastle-upon-Tyne. His only child was baptised James Solis, after his family, but by the error of the parish clerk the name was entered on the register as James Solas, which mode of spelling Dodd afterwards adopted. In 1727 Don Jago died in London, having failed to reconcile his father, Don Gaspard de Solis, to his marriage with a Protestant, by which he lost his patrimony and commission. Young Dodd received a good education, it being his mother's wish that he should take orders, but ‘on some family reasons’ he was ultimately put apprentice to John Hills, a surgeon practising in the Minories, London, with whom he continued seven years. In 1745 he entered the navy as surgeon's mate of the Blenheim hospital-ship, and served till the end of the war in the Devonshire, a ship of sixty-six guns, and the St. Albans. He continued for some months after the peace in the St. Albans, it being then stationed at Plymouth as a guardship. He took up his diploma as a member of the Corporation of Surgeons, London, in 1751, and practised in Gough Square, Fleet Street, and afterwards in Suffolk Street, Haymarket. In 1752 he commenced authorship with ‘An Essay towards a Natural History of the Herring,’ 8vo, London, written to promote the industry as advocated by the Society of the Free British Fishery. He was indebted to Dr. Thomas Birch for assistance in his literary projects (cf. his letter to Birch, dated 14 April 1752, in Addit. MS. 4305, f. 2). The next year he took part in the great Canning controversy by publishing ‘A Physical Account of the Case of Elizabeth Canning, with an Enquiry into the probability of her subsisting in the manner therein asserted,’ &c., 8vo, London, 1753, in which he argues strongly for the truth of the girl's story. Towards the close of January 1754, ‘on account of some deaths in his family,’ Dodd set out for the continent, returning in May following. In 1759 he again entered the navy; ‘came as supernumerary in the Sheerness from Leghorn to Gibraltar;’ there went on board the Prince, and continued in her till June 1762. In the same year he qualified at Surgeons' Hall as master-surgeon of any ship of the first rate, and was warranted for the Hawke, in which he served till she was paid off at the peace, February 1763. He then settled once more in London, ‘chiefly,’ as he says, ‘in the literary line.’ One of these literary undertakings was a series of lectures first delivered in 1766 in the great room of Exeter Exchange, and afterwards published with the title ‘A Satyrical Lecture on Hearts, to which is added a Critical Dissertation on Noses,’ 8vo, London, 1767 (second edition the same year). In his preface Dodd disclaimed all notion of having imitated G. A. Stevens's lectures on heads, asserting ‘that both the heads and hearts were first thought on in consequence of the beau and coquette in the “Spectator.”’ The reviewer of the book in the ‘Gentleman's Magazine’ (xxxvii. 73–4) attributes to Dodd the authorship of a periodical essay published some years before under the title of ‘The Scourge.’ On 7 February 1767 the house in which he lodged, adjoining the gateway of the Saracen's Head inn on Snow Hill, suddenly fell to the ground, but he and his family escaped with the loss only of their belongings (ib. xxxvii. 92). His wife's head being affected by this accident, Dodd left London and went to Bath and Bristol for her recovery; thence he wandered to Ireland, where he ‘followed his business and literary employments’ in Dublin. In March 1779 he was ‘invited’ to return to London. He brought with him a play founded on ‘Le Naufrage’ of J. de Lafont, which held the boards at Covent Garden for exactly one night. It was published the same year as ‘Gallic Gratitude; or, the Frenchman in India,’ a comedy in two acts, 8vo, London, 1779, and was reissued as having been acted in Dublin, with a new title-page, ‘The Funeral Pile,’ 12mo, Dublin, 1799 (Baker, Biographia Dramatica, ed. 1812, i. 191, ii. 254, 255). At the end of the first issue are some ‘Critical Remarks on Mrs. Jackson's Performance of Lady Randolph in the Tragedy of “Douglas,” &c.’ Another undertaking was ‘The Ancient and Modern History of Gibraltar. … With an accurate Journal of the Siege … by the Spaniards … 1727, translated from the original Spanish, published by authority at Madrid,’ 8vo, London, 1781. In 1781 he became intimate with a Major John Savage, who styled himself Baron Weildmester, and had, he alleged, pressing claims on Lord North. This adventurer, on undertaking to defray all expenses, induced Dodd to embark with his family with him for Russia, where, he said, he had a plan to propose from a foreign power to the empress to enter into a treaty of alliance, and thus he and Dodd would be sent as ambassadors; ‘that Mrs. Dodd, &c. should remain under the czarina's protection, and that on their return they would be decorated with the order of St. Catherine & have 1,000l. a year pension.’ Charmed with this proposal, Dodd cheerfully bore the expense until Riga was reached, where he learned Savage's true character. Accordingly, he was glad to take passage in a vessel bound to Bowness on the Firth of Forth. He landed at Leith in December 1781 almost destitute of means. In the following year he appeared at Edinburgh as actor and lecturer. David Stewart Erskine, eleventh earl of Buchan, was interested in him, and among Buchan's manuscripts is a paper in Dodd's handwriting relating the story of his career from his earliest years. A verbatim transcript is given in ‘Notes and Queries,’ 6th ser. vii. 483–4. He died in Mecklenburgh Street, Dublin, in the spring of 1805, aged 84, ‘a gentleman of amiable and entertaining manners, whose converse with the literary world and fund of anecdote rendered his company extremely agreeable.’ In the obituaries of Walker's ‘Hibernian Magazine,’ 1805, p. 256, and of the ‘Gentleman's Magazine,’ vol. lxxv. pt. i. p. 388, his age is foolishly asserted to have been 104. According to the ‘European Magazine,’ xlvii. 402, Dodd ‘was a great frequenter of the disputing societies and a president of one of them.’\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Goodwin, Gordon (1888). \"Dodd, James Solas\".

        "content": "The Stiehl Assassin is a fantasy novel by Terry Brooks in his Shannara series. It is the third book in the The Fall of Shannara series, first published in 2019.\n\n\n== Plot summary ==\nThe novel picks up where The Skaar Invasion left off, with Tavo plunging the Stiehl blade into his sister Tarsha's back, but it turns out she is only a magical illusion and Tavo is quickly disarmed. In the scuffle, the evil Clizia Porse retrieves the Stiehl Blade and escapes. The druid Drisker Arc fashions a magical collar and places it around Tavo's neck so he cannot call up the Wishsong. Drisker decides to consult the dead at the Hadeshorn to see what to do about Clizia Porse. He tries to summon Allanon, but ends up summoning Grianne Ohmsford. She is still trapped in The Forbidding, but has figured out how to communicate through the Hadeshorn. She agrees to help him if he will return her to the young woman she was before she entered into the service of the Mother Tanequil. He agrees, and she tells him that Shea Ohmsford is the key. Using the Elfstones, they find Shea.\nCor d’Amphere, king of the Skaar, arrives at the front lines of the Skaar Invasion and relieves his daughter Ajin d’Amphere of command, sending her back to Skaarsland. Cor commands Ajin's second in command and confidant (who secretly loves her), Kol’Dre, known as The Penetrator, to stay with him. Cor meets with the Federation Prime Minister, Ketter Vause, and demands to keep the lands they have conquered. Vause agrees and has his assistant Belladrin Rish draw up the agreement and take it to the Skaar king. Later, Belladrin Rish goes to the Dwarves and enlists Battenhyle, Lakodan, and a company of dwarves to come to the Skaar battlefront with their machine, The Revealer, in exchange for a release from conscripting of dwarves into the Federation army for 50 years.\nEn route to Skaarsland the ship carrying Ajin crashes. Jor’ Alt, commanded by Ajin's step-mother (The Pretender), attempts to assassinate Ajin, but she kills him. She is then rescued by Darcon (Dar) Leah and Tarsha. Ajin pursues Dar romantically, and they begin to fall in love.\nClizia Porse sneaks into the Skaar camp and makes an alliance with the king. She convinces him to send her and a compliment of soldiers to claim Paranor for Skaarsland, but the guardian kills her guards and chases her from the keep. She knows now that Drisker has convinced the guardian that she is a threat, and no longer a druid. She decides she must destroy Drisker to reverse this. She returns to the Skaar king and suggests that she will kill the Elf king, Gerrendren Elessedil, and the Federation Prime Minister, Ketter Vause, to distract them from the war effort, giving the Skaar an advantage in battle.\n\tShea Ohmsford rescues Tindall from the Assidian Deep prison, but they are tracked back to their hideout by Commander Zakonis. Seelah rescues them, killing Zakonis’ men, but leaving him bound. Shea decides to accompany Rocan Arneas and his cousin Sartren Longlet aboard the giant airship Behemoth carrying the weather changing machine, Annabelle. He learns about Annabelle from Tindall during their journey. Shea breaks his promise not to reveal Annabelle and tells Drisker Arc about it. Drisker demands that Behemoth take Annabelle to Skaarsland to try to end the long winter that has caused them to invade the Four Lands in search of a warmer home. Rocan reluctantly agrees.\nDrisker, Tarsha, and Tavo return to the Hadeshorn, where Drisker tries to summon Grianne again, but this time summons Allanon. Allanon confirms that Grianne's advice was sound and then has Drisker anoint Tarsha with water from the Hadeshorn (thought to be deadly). They do not tell her why. They then return to Paranor to use the waters of the Scrye Bowl to find Clizia Porse, finding her in Arborlon, the Elven Capital City. Tavo is visited by Fluken and has a meltdown.\nClizia Porse sneaks into the Palace at Arborlon and beheads the Elven king with the Stiehl Blade, but the use of the magic leaves her drained. After several days of recovery, she sneaks into the Federation Camp to assassinate the Prime Minister, but Drisker anticipated this after the assassination of the Elven king and stops her, but she escapes. Tavo finds her but is unable to use the Wishsong to stop her since he is still wearing Drisker's collar.\nFearing for his life, Ketter Vause orders an attack on the Skaar encampment, only to find it abandoned. The Skaar flank the Federation and attack while the majority of the Federation force is deployed. The Federation use the Reveals, which sprays a neon-like liquid on the invisible Skaar soldiers, revealing them. The Skaar had learned of the Revealer in advance, so they wear cloaks to catch most of the liquid, and then discard the cloaks. It makes the Revealer less effective, but still renders the Skaar soldiers invisibility less effective. The Federation prevails in battle.\nMeanwhile, the Behemoth suffers damage in a storm and is forced to land on an Island called Nambizi, one of the nine islands off the coast of Nambia, according to Ajin. Dar and Ajin are attacked by a giant rhinoceros, that is called off by a black boy, who then signals for them to leave. Shea hears this story and sneaks off at night to meet the boy. They exchange names, the boy is called Borshawk, but a language barrier prohibits further communication. Shea says \"friends,\" and conveys the meaning by shaking his hand. Later that nite, Behemoth is attacked by black men riding giant bat-like creatures. Ajin and Dar board a Sprint and counterattack. The attackers flee, while Ajin and Dar pursue, but their Sprint loses power and crashes near a fleet of enemy ships.\nCor d’Amphere asks Kol’Dre to assassinate Ketter Vause in exchange for Ajin's hand in marriage. Kol agrees, and kills Vause, but is then killed by Belladrin Rish who says \"Cor d’Amphere thanks you greatly for your service,\" revealing that she is a Skaar spy.\nClizia Porse sets a trap for Drisker Arc at the Cleeg Hold, and brews Nightshade to send him to the Forbidding. She succeeds. She then attacks Tarsha, sending her falling from a cliff. Freed from his collar, Tavo attacks with the Wishsong, but Clizia counterattacks, and slits his throat. As the novel closes, it is revealed that the use of the Nightshade exchanged Drisker with a Jachyra from the Forbidding.\n\n\n== Characters ==\nThe characters are:\n\nAjin d’Amphere is a princess from the island nation of Skaarsland near the continent of Eurodia, and daughter of Cor d’Amphere.\nAllanon is a Druid who has been dead for hundreds of years and resides in the Netherworld.\nAnnabelle is a machine that can allegedly change the weather.

        "revision_id": 1219092206,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Between October 6, 2020, and October 22, 2020, Fulani militants from Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin's Katiba Macina laid siege to the town of Farabougou, Ségou Region, Mali. The fighting initially began as an intensification of ethnic conflict between Bambara and Fulani militias, and escalated when Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin surrounded the city. As JNIM tightened the siege on the city, residents faced famine and drought. Mediation committees composed of leaders and elders from nearby villages attempted to negotiate the lifting of the siege, but Malian forces liberated it on October 22. Jihadists still held a large presence near the town for weeks to come.\n\n\n== Background ==\nJama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin, a coalition of jihadist groups that merged in 2017, has intensified its operations in central Mali's Mopti and Ségou regions since 2020, with the main local affiliate Katiba Macina often being composed of Fulani youth. These offensives came around a time when Malian forces began arming and aiding Dan Na Ambassagou and other regional militias in these regions to counter the jihadist threat. Because of this, civil conflicts between ethnic groups such as the Bambara and Fulani can often spiral into clashes between pro-Malian government militias or direct involvement of Malian forces versus jihadist or anti-government militias.Farabougou is located near the Wagadou Forest, a known hideout for JNIM and Katiba Macina. Many attacks carried out on Farabougou and villages around the forest have been claimed by these two groups in the past. The town had a population of 3,000 residents prior to the battle.\n\n\n== Siege ==\nDuring the weekly market on October 6, armed men likely affiliated with JNIM kidnapped twenty people and killed one young man in Farabougou. At the time of the kidnapping, the civilians were headed to the market in Dogofry. The kidnapping sparked clashes between Bambara hunters and the JNIM fighters, who were Fulani. Nine people, mostly women and children, were released by JNIM later that evening. The bridge between the villages and the towns of Dogofry and Touba Coura was destroyed, effectively leaving Farabougou and Kourouma Koubé encircled.On October 9, residents from Farabougou went to a small village nearby to search for the remaining hostages. The jihadists began firing at the civilians, leaving six dead on the spot and twenty-two others injured. Meanwhile, clashes reignited on October 9 between Bambara dozo hunters and JNIM outside of Farabougou, killing ten dozos and injuring many more. JNIM overran the group, and kidnapped a further ten civilians. The jihadists then tightened the siege on Farabougou, blocking imports and exports of food, along with slaughtering and capturing 3,000 cattle owned by the villagers. The lack of food led to the deaths of three children in the village by October 12. By that time, despite pleas from villagers for aid by Malian forces in Diabaly, no aid had arrived in the town.On October 13, at least 2,000 people had fled Farabougou, fleeing to nearby Sokolo. Residents of Sokolo came together to administer aid and housing to the residents, while Malian security forces were not present in the area. A coalition of mayors from surrounding areas, tribal leaders, and religious leaders attempted to mediate with the jihadists to lift the siege, but the convoy was unable to enter the village. Residents remaining in the town were holed up in their homes. One resident in the town, speaking to RFI by phone, stated that he was fearful of stepping outside because jihadists were roaming the streets.Malian sources on October 16 stated that Farabougou was \"deserted\", and that while Malian forces had conducted intelligence on the village, the roads were impassable due to the rains and an offensive was impossible. The Malian forces subsequently returned to DIabaly. In Farabougou itself, the local jihadist leaders were themselves running out of food, water, and other supplies. The jihadists also burned granaries in the town, heightening the famine. Protests erupted in Dogofry calling on Malian authorities to act in lifting the siege. On October 19, Malian forces airdropped food and resources to the villagers. However, Malian forces were unable to access the village itself due to jihadists imploding the bridge on October 18, and jihadist groups began embedding themselves in the surrounding villages.Malian forces and dozos launched another offensive to recapture Farabougou on October 20, bypassing several villages that day. Mediation efforts continued round this time, but with little success. One mediator stated that while the attackers referred to themselves as jihadists, their rationale for the siege was the killing of several Fulani residents by Bambara notables in and around Farabougou in early October. The tipping point for the attacks was the death of a Fulani shepherd in his field in early October. The mediators apologized for the killings, but direct meetings between the coalition and the jihadists had still not happened. Malian forces again airdropped food and supplies on October 20. The food was received by the villagers, but many were just waiting for Malian forces to flush the jihadists out.On October 21, the Association of Nationals of the Rural Community of Dogofry (ANCRD), consisting of village leaders and elders from Dogofry, Sokolo, and Farabougou, announced their intentions to mobilize residents to liberate Farabougou if Malian forces would not enter the town. The association stated that remaining residents of Farabougou were on the brink of starvation. Malian political figures such as former Prime Minister Moussa Mara and politicians Cheick Oumar Sissoko and Mountaga Tall urged action by Malian forces on the city.Malian forces were airdropped in Farabougou on October 22, postponing a mediation meeting. The forces were led by vice-president Assimi Goïta and Didier Dembele. The paratroopers were dropped off in the village in several intervals, securing the town and escorting hungry villagers to hospitals. Meanwhile, large numbers of Malian vehicles were present around the village, preparing for a ground assault on the town if mediation failed. A third package of food was airdropped by Malian forces that same day. Farabougou was confirmed to be liberated by Malian forces by the end of October 22. Malian forces took up positions on all corners of the town. MINUSMA logistics also helped Malian forces capture the town.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nDespite the Malian liberation of Farabougou, jihadists still had a large presence around the town. One resident stated that he was still worried about the threat of jihadists even after Malian forces were present in the town. On October 22, as Farabougou was being captured by Mali, the nearby village of Kourouma Koubé was attacked by jihadists, leaving one injured. Dozos repelled the attack before Malian forces arrived. One mediator stated that the Malian forces had disrupted a permanent solution to the jihadist threat, as the Malian forces couldn't secure the area forever, highlighting the need for negotiation.Bamada reported that despite the jihadists fleeing Farabougou, the logistical support they had and the impassable road connecting the town to Dogofry meant that the chance of a second attack was extremely high. Almost all villages in the area have connections with Katiba Macina in the area, and jihadists had already begun threatening residents of Dily with a siege if they celebrated festivals. While no town is explicitly occupied, all of them are threatened. Mediation efforts in the area made dozos lay down their arms in exchange for Fulani militants not attacking their livestock and returning the ones they stole.Twenty villagers were kidnapped on October 31 between Dogofry and Farabougou, marking the end of the calm imposed by Malian forces in Farabougou. A mediator stated that immediately after dozos laid down their weapons, the Fulani vowed \"to pick them up\". The imam of the nearby village of N'Debougou was assassinated with his trader on November 2, with both jihadists and dozos blaming one another. Dozos also made Fulani residents in Dogofry get out of their vehicles on November 3, and subsequently executed them. The government of Niono Cercle organized an intercommunity conference in early November to enlarge the discussions from ANCRD. The conference culminated in a non-aggression pact.Malian foces began decreasing it's presence Farabougou in early November, and French forces dropped some food supplies in the village on November 7. The next day, Malian forces and civilians were shot at in two separate incidents near Farabougou. Abdoulaye Coulibaly, head of Farabougou dozos, stated that his village would defend itself if jihadists attacked again. Later, the towns of N'Debougou, Yere Don Samiona, and Toridagako were besieged to a lesser extent by jihadists.\n\n\n== External links ==\nAbdoulaye Coulibaly: La forum de Niono n'a rien change - Olivier Dubois\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Abandoned and Blighted Property Conservatorship Act (Act 135) is a Pennsylvania law that enables nonprofits and individuals to petition a court to be appointed “conservators” of properties they allege to be blighted and abandoned.\n\n\n== Background on Act 135 ==\nThe Pennsylvania legislature passed Act 135 in 2008. The act established property conservatorship as a mechanism to address blight. The act was designed to provide community members with standing to petition for the right to rehabilitate and take ownership of abandoned properties.\n\n\n=== 2014 Amendment ===\nPennsylvania legislators amended the legislation in October 2014. Representative John Taylor\nintroduced the amendments, arguing that they would make conservatorship more attractive to private developers.\n\n\n== Provisions ==\nUnder the law, in order for the court to appoint a conservator, the petitioner must show that all of the following apply as of the date of filing:\n\n\n== Unintended consequences ==\nA study carried out by the Advocacy for Racial and Civil Justice Clinic at the University of Pennsylvania's school of law found that Act 135 petitions were \"disproportionately filed in communities vulnerable to gentrification\" and \"disproportionately filed against Asian-American ... and to a lesser degree Black respondents.\"A series of articles appearing in the Philadelphia Inquirer described how people at risk of displacement in challenging circumstances had lost their houses to conservatorships.\n\n\n== References ==",

Tracie Laymon's company, Laymon's Terms, as well as Five By Eight Productions produced the film.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe film premiered at the South by Southwest film festival on March 9, 2024, where it received the Narrative Feature Grand Jury Award.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nFollowing the film's SXSW release, Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com wrote that Bob Trevino Likes It is \"the kind of movie that will make certain viewers roll their eyes but inspire others to see it multiple times in a theater, just to have that great feeling again.\" Seitz criticized Jeanie, Bob's wife, as a character lacking dimension but noted that his complaints about the movie were \"minor in the greater scheme\".\nAngie Han of The Hollywood Reporter said of the film that it \"draws its emotional power not from watching its characters break, but from letting them start to heal\" and that it \"succeeds beautifully on its own terms as a love letter, or perhaps a thank you note\" but criticized how Lily and Bob seem to bond too easily, as their \"jagged edges fit together as neatly as pieces of a puzzle\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Fredy Samuel Lundh (born 1995), known professionally as Fredy Clue, is a Swedish folk musician and artist from Gothenburg. Educated at the Academy of Music and Drama at the University of Gothenburg, Clue later began performing on stage. Playing the nyckelharpa as a solo act, Clue produces uses sound sampling and looping effects to produce layered soundscapes. Their lyrics and spoken word are often inspired by their non-binary gender identity. Their debut EP, Vill du Leka?, was released in 2023. Clue also plays in two folk quartets, Furuhill and Woodlands+Bäckafall, and volunteers for nonprofit organizations that support the folk arts in Sweden.\nClue is responsible for producing the Bäckadräkten, which is considered Sweden's first unisex folk costume. Their purpose was to invite wider participation in Swedish folk traditions by making available an outfit that is not restricted to a specific gender. They collaborated with the Textile Museum of Borås, as well as professionals with backgrounds in clothing design and production. The costume combines components of older Swedish folk costumes and merges design elements traditionally considered male and female. It has attracted praise, negative reactions, and international press attention.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nFredy Samuel Lundh was born in 1995. They said in an interview that they were born in Dalecarlia, Sweden, and raised north of Stockholm. They described their earliest memory involving music as happening when both they and their brother were young children. Their father dressed them both as circus fleas and trained them to sing a song together as a performance. Lundh attended the Academy of Music and Drama at the University of Gothenburg, and later moved to Gothenburg.\n\n\n== Music career ==\n\nFor their work as an artist and musician, Lundh adopted the stage name Fredy Clue. Clue is a multi-instrumentalist known for playing the nyckelharpa. Clue described in an interview being introduced to the nyckelharpa while participating in the Ethno Sweden music camp for youth. They were already interested in the violin, but felt the instrument did not fit their tall stature. They were also interested in the guitar. Clue said that when they discovered the nyckelharpa at the youth camp, they felt it was an appropriate fit for their body type, while combining qualities they liked about both the violin and guitar. Clue started playing this instrument after that point.\nClue often performs on stage alone, combining autobiographical lyrics and spoken word about discovering their non-binary gender identity. Those lyrics are set against soundscapes made from sound samples and looping effects. British arts reviewer William Quinn described Clue as having a \"deep, lilting voice\" and a musical performance that is \"a multifaceted experience\" that is \"indefinable by definition\".\nClue performed at the pride festival in Borås in 2022 and the Barnlek festival in 2023. In a 2023 interview, Clue reported plans to perform for King Carl XVI Gustaf in Strängnäs at a National Day of Sweden celebration later that year. Quinn reviewed Clue's performance at the Edinburgh Tradfest in 2023: \"Fredy is really a creator of remarkable experiences, a true innovator in the folk art space.\"\nClue's first album is an EP released 2 June 2023. Clue translates the title Vill du Leka? to \"Do You Wanna Play?\". Clue plays nyckelharpa, violin, and synth, accompanied by guest musicians Mårten Hillbom (percussion), Sabina Lilja (piano, vocals) and Julia Bengtson (vocals, samples). The EP's eight songs combine disparate musical genres, with lyrics that explore Clue's non-binary identity. Clue describes the inspiration as their personal struggle with depression and successfully finding a path back to experiencing joy. The lyrics, they said in an interview, came easily, but setting them to music was for some songs much harder.\nClue also plays nyckelharpa for folk quartets Furuhill and Woodlands+Bäckafall. Furuhill plays traditional Swedish folk music and released the EP Får vi bjuda? in 2022. Woodlands+Bäckafall combines the Swedish and Scottish folk music traditions and played for the Gothenburg Folk Festival in March 2024. In 2023, they were one of eight ensembles awarded a continuing education scholarship by the Royal Swedish Academy of Music. These awards support training and professional development in Swedish classical, jazz, and folk music.\n\n\n== Bäckadräkten ==\n\nOver the first six months of 2022, Clue worked with illustrator and textile designer Ida Björs to design and develop the first unisex Swedish folk costume. The idea first occurred to Clue during a conversation with a friend at the 2018 Bingsjöstämman folk festival about the need for a traditional outfit that was not gendered female or male. To finance and promote the Bäckadräkten project, Clue partnered with the Textile Museum of Borås. Clue led a series of focus group meetings with young queer people associated with Sweden's folk music and dance communities. Clue and Björs sought assistance from a silversmith, a dance shoe designer, and a tailor to produce the costume's various components. The resulting Bäckadräkten costume features a water theme and design elements drawn from the 840 different traditional costumes in Sweden that precede this one. Many of the components combine traditionally female and male designs, for instance the skirt-like culottes and the vest that is also a bodice. It was exhibited at the Textile Museum from 30 June 2022, through 28 August 2022, and is worn by Clue at public performances and lectures. Clue made the sewing pattern available as early as July 2023, but also encourages Swedes to produce their own with modifications to suit users' individual identities.\nThe Bäckadräkten's release was announced on the official Facebook page of Sweden and was covered by news outlets in Sweden, the UK, Finland, and South Africa. The release also sparked discussions on social media, including negative reactions from people in the Swedish folk community to whom Clue refers as the dräpo, or dress police. Clue is hopeful that these discussions will raise awareness of non-binary people in the Swedish folk community and create room for more to participate. Björs has said she believes the Bäckadräkten will be remembered by future generations as the first of many unisex Swedish folk costumes.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nFredy Clue came out as non-binary in late 2021, and has since used the pronouns they/them in English and de/dem in Swedish. They reported in an interview discovering their non-binary gender identity early in the Bäckadräkten project process: \"Suddenly Mx Enby knocked so hard that I fell down crying in part fear part happiness.\" In April 2023, Clue reported serving as board chair of the Gothenburg-based folk music nonprofit organization, Folkmusikkaféet. Before getting involved with that organization, they volunteered with Folk Youth Västra Götaland. Clue also enjoys recreational ocean sailing.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nBäckadräkten page on Dräktnyckel index of Swedish folk costumes",

        "content": "Filip Swirski is a Polish-Canadian-American scientist and educator serving as the Arthur and Janet C. Ross Professor of Medicine, Cardiology and Professor of Radiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and is the Director of the Cardiovascular Research Institute. He is also a member of the Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Institute (BMEII), the Marc and Jennifer Lipschultz Precision Immunology Institute (PrIISM), and The Friedman Brain Institutes (FBI) at Mount Sinai. His research partly focuses on innate and inflammatory mechanisms in cardiovascular disease. He is known for his work in cardioimmunology and notably for linking atherosclerosis with blood monocytosis.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nSwirski earned his Bachelor of Arts and Science specializing in biochemistry and a Ph.D. in immunology at McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada. He received an honorary MS from Harvard Medical School in 2020 for accomplishing a full professorship. He was professor at the Center for Systems Biology at Massachusetts General Hospital and at Harvard Medical School.\n\n\n== Research and scientific contributions ==\nSwirski focuses on understanding how leukocytes shape and are shaped by inflammation. His research uses in vivo models of acute and chronic inflammation relevant to cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, infectious, and metabolic diseases. His writings reflect translational and fundamental cardiovascular and neurodegenerative science research, including cell development, mind-marrow communication, and function.\n\n\n=== Novel findings ===\n\n\n==== Monocytes and macrophages ====\nSwirski described that increased blood monocyte levels, otherwise known as monocytosis, develop in response to hypercholesterolemia and is progressive and proportional to disease severity.\nAlthough monocytes develop predominantly in bone marrow, Swirski showed that hypercholesterolemia leads to monocyte production in the spleen in a process called extramedullary hematopoiesis, which further drives atherosclerosis progression.\nShowed that monocyte-derived macrophages recruited to the atherosclerotic plaque self-renew in the lesion, further accelerating atherosclerosis.\nDescribed monocyte recruitment during myocardial infarction and showed a role for a splenic monocyte reservoir as a source of monocytes after myocardial infarction.\n\n\n==== Lifestyle and brain-body communication ====\nSwirski explores how cardiovascular health is affected by diet, sleep, exercise, and other lifestyle patterns. He showed that sleep limits monocyte production, thereby protecting against atherosclerosis.\nShowed that sleep fragmentation increases atherogenesis in a mouse model and demonstrated that sleep disruption increases myelopoiesis in the bone marrow, leading to monocytosis and larger atherosclerotic lesions. The results yielded that the marrow contains a pre-neutrophil that regulates monocyte production via hypocretin-dependent CSF-1. Hypocretin, a wake-promoting hormone in the hypothalamus, communicates with bone marrow and regulates leukocyte production. This demonstrates a brain-marrow axis involving a secreted neuropeptide.\nHe demonstrated that sleep interruption increases the rate of hematopoiesis in the bone marrow, which accelerates neutral drift.\nShowed that IL-3 is a crucial communicator between glial cells (microglia) located throughout the brain and spinal cord, and astrocytes. Using mouse models of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), data showed that IL-3 protects against AD by programming microglia.\nUnder psychological stress, neurons from different brain regions control the migration of immune cells in the body. Mice under stress were more prone to higher inflammation and death in response to infection with influenza and SARS-CoV-2.\nFasting in mice prompts monocytes to re-enter the bone marrow, which increases their lifespan. This process is mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA). Upon re-feeding, distinct monocytes mobilize back to the blood, altering the host's response to infection. The underlying study showed the body can limit energy expenditure when nutrition is scarce. Without it, the body slows down metabolic expenditure, limiting production and preserving—and thus extending—the lifespan of already-made, short-lived monocytes.\n\n\n==== Immunometabolic communication ====\nSwirski identified an on-demand mechanism by which transient monocyte-derived macrophages dispose of erythrocytes and recycle iron.\nIdentified a population of intraepithelial T cells that are strategically positioned in the gut that modulate systemic dietary metabolism. Without these, mice were metabolically hyperactive, and resisted the development of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia/atherosclerosis.\nShowed that cholesterol sensors called Liver X Receptors were important in developing and functioning T cells in the thymus, the lymphoid gland where T cells are produced.\n\n\n==== Influence of hematopoietic growth factors ====\nSwirski showed the Influence of growth factors in disease, where he described a GM-CSF-producing B cell that protects against sepsis and pneumonia.\nDemonstrated that the growth factor interleukin 3  (IL-3) aggravates sepsis by eliciting a cytokine storm, heightening inflammation leading to death.\nIdentified a critical role for IL-3 in myocarditis and showed that IL-3 regulates microglial function in Alzheimer’s Disease.\n\n\n== Honors and awards ==\nPartial list:\n\nClarivate Highly Cited Investigators\nOutstanding Investigator Award from the NHLBI (2016-2022)\nEstablished Investigator Award from the American Heart Association (2017-2022)\nWilliam Harvey Lecture from the European Society of Cardiology (2020)\nJeffrey M. Hoeg Award from the American Heart Association (2017)\nMartin Prize for Fundamental Research\nHoward M. Goodman Fellowship (2016)\n\n\n== Publications ==\nAs of 2024, Swirski is credited with 38,923 citations and has an h-index of 95.  His most cited contributions to date are on myocardial infarction, ventricular remodeling, inflammation, stem cell niche, hematopoiesis and hematopoietic stem cells.

        "content": "Claudius Galen Wheelhouse (29 December 1826 – 9 April 1909) was an English physician and photographer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWheelhouse was born at Snaith in Yorkshire on 29 December 1826, was second son of James Wheelhouse, surgeon. At seven he left the grammar school at Snaith for Christ's Hospital preparatory school at Hertford, and entered Christ's Hospital in London in 1836. He was apprenticed at sixteen to R. C. Ward of Ollerton, Newark, and always strongly advocated the system of apprenticeship. He entered the Leeds school of medicine in October 1846, and was admitted M.R.C.S. England on 25 March 1849, and a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries in 1850. He then went to the Mediterranean on a yachting cruise as surgeon to Lord Lincoln, afterwards fifth duke of Newcastle and secretary of state for war. He took with him one of the first photographic cameras which left England, and obtained many good photographs in spite of the cumbrous processes.\nWheelhouse returned to England in 1851, and entered into partnership with Joseph Prince Garlick of Park Row, Leeds, the senior surgeon to the dispensary and lecturer on surgery at the Leeds school of medicine. In the same year he was elected surgeon to the public dispensary and demonstrator of anatomy in the medical school, where he was successively lecturer on anatomy, physiology, and surgery. He was twice president of the school, and when the new university of Leeds was inaugurated in October 1904 Wheelhouse was made hon. D.Sc. He was surgeon to the Leeds infirmary from March 1884.\nElected F.R.C.S. England on 9 June 1864, he served on the college council from 1876 to 1881. President of the council of the British Medical Association 1881–4, he presided at the Leeds meeting in 1889. In 1897, when the association held its annual meeting at Montreal, McGill College made him hon. LL.D., and he received the gold medal of the association.\nIn 1886, when the Medical Act brought direct representatives of the profession on the general medical council, Wheelhouse headed the poll in England and Wales. Re-elected in 1891 at the end of his term, he did not seek re-election in 1897. From 1870 to 1895 he was first secretary and afterwards treasurer of the West Riding Medical Charity, and in 1902 he was presented by his fellow members with an address of thanks and testimonial.\nOn retiring from practice at Leeds in 1891 he settled at Filey, where he was active in local affairs. He died at Filey on 9 April 1909, and was buried there. He married in 1860 Agnes Caroline, daughter of Joseph Cowell, vicar of Todmorden, and had issue three daughters.\nWheelhouse filled the unusual position of a general practitioner who made a name in pure surgery. An admirable teacher, he did much to convert the Leeds medical school into a worthy integral part of the university. In 1876 he advocated that form of external urethrotomy for impermeable strictures to which his name is given (Wheelhouse's Method); it displaced all rival methods. The operation was first described in the ‘British Medical Journal,’ 1876, i. 779, in a paper entitled ‘Perineal section as performed at Leeds.’\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Power, D'Arcy (1912). \"Wheelhouse, Claudius Galen\".

It is a zombie-themed game.\n\n\n== Development and release ==\nUndawn had more than 300 developers and was considered a \"key\" game developed in-house by Tencent, with an alleged budget of approximately CN¥1 billion (around US$140 million). It was first announced in March 2021. A May 2023 trailer revealed that the game would feature actor Will Smith. The game was released on June 15, 2023, for Android, iOS, and Windows. Garena published the game on June 29 for select Southeast Asia countries.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nAccording to a report by Reuters published on March 21, 2024, Undawn \"flopped spectacularly\", generating a revenue of $287,000 in the previous month, according to research firm Appmagic. Some reviewers noted that the game was relatively unheard of before the report, despite it featuring Smith.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of zombie games\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

He was educated for five years at Norwich grammar school, and was admitted a pensioner at Caius College, Cambridge, on 2 November 1708. He was a scholar of the college from Michaelmas 1708 to Michaelmas 1715, and graduated B.A. in 1712–13 and M.A. in 1716. He matriculated at Leyden University on 1 October 1716, but, returning to Cambridge, he graduated M.D. in 1723. He was admitted a candidate of the College of Physicians, London, on 23 December 1723, and a fellow on 22 December 1724. He was censor of the college in 1731, 1736, 1739, and 1748; was named an elect on 30 August 1746; and was consiliarius in 1749 and 1754. On the death of James Jurin, he was elected president, 2 April 1750, and was reappointed 1750, 1751, 1752, and 1753. He was chosen physician to the Westminster Hospital at its foundation in 1719, but resigned his office there in 1733, having been one of the six physicians appointed to St. George's Hospital at the first general board held on 19 October of that year. He died on 1 April 1757. His library was sold by auction soon after his death.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Webb, William Wilfrid (1899). \"Wasey, William\".

SQR stood for August E. Schumacher (1881–1948), Wesley P. Quarton and Oscar H. Renner.\n\n\n== First location (1907–1915) ==\nThe store's original location was at the old Kroeger (Schumacher) Building, northeast corner of Center St. and Los Angeles St. (now Anaheim Blvd.).  On March 14, 1907, Schumacher, Quenton and Renner bought the \"Pioneer Store\" from Charles \"Sam\" Federman who had already been operating it for 25 years since 1883. Schumacher and Renner were clerks in the store at the time, which the Anaheim Gazette characterized as a \"small country store\". The three men were the only staff serving customers at that time, but by 1928 the store had grown to a staff of twenty. Competition in these early days included the Falkenstein department store in the Mitchell block at the northwest corner of Center and Los Angeles, which moved to new quarters at the new Casou Building in 1916, which replaced the oldest building in town at that time, the Langenberger adobe.\n\n\n== Second location (1915–1926) ==\nIn 1913, the SQR Store moved into a new building that Emil Dreyfus erected at 102 W. Center, southwest corner of Los Angeles, who tore down the existing building there that the Ahlborn & Raymond department store had vacated and which Stern Bros. had occupied before that. where it would remain until 1926. \n\n\n== Third location (1926–1978) ==\nContinuing to grow, in 1926, SQR bought the building at the southwest corner of Center and Lemon streets from the Knights of Pythias, tore down the Herman Dickel grocery and hardware building there, and built a new SQR Store, which would be its final location.\nQuarton left the business that year, but the store name remained \"S.Q.R.\"\nBy 1953 the store staff had grown to 80 strong.\n\n\n== Decline of Downtown Anaheim ==\nIn 1954 SQR started to face competition from new, modern and car-friendly shopping centers nearby, including:\n\nEast Anaheim Shopping Center, 1.6 miles east, in March, 1954 and expanding in include an 80,000 sq ft (7,400 m2) W. T. Grant and Boston Stores\nthe Broadway-anchored Anaheim Plaza, 1.5 miles west, on the 5 freeway at Euclid, openiing in 1955\nOrangefair Center in 1956, 1.5 miles north\nBullock's Fashion Square-Santa Ana in 1958, 5 miles southeast\nThe City 4.5 miles south, and the Mall of Orange, 4.5 miles east, both in 1970.\nWhile many American cities tried to revitalize and save their historic downtowns, Anaheim chose to demolish it. While at first, downtown merchants tried to attract shoppers by renovating their properties and the city provided off-street parking, it was not enough. In 1973, the city adopted a Redevelopment Plan \"Alpha\" which called for the demolition of nearly all the buildings in the 200-acre (81 ha) historic downtown and replacing them with a new downtown with a new civic center, the Anaheim Towne Center strip mall and office buildings. This process took a little more than fifteen years. \nThe store advertised its imminent closing in September 1973, but Val Renner (widow of Oscar Renner's son Russell) reopened the first floor with her sons. However, in 1978 the Anaheim Redevelopment Agency condemned the building and many other surrounding properties, and the store was razed in mid-1978. In place of the buildings that once formed the retail heart of Downtown Anaheim were built a strip mall anchored by a grocery store, a large parking area even larger than the strip mall, and a rerouted Lincoln Street. As Lincoln has been rerouted, the southwest corner of old Center/Lincoln and Lemon is in the parking lot.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== External links ==\nEarly images of the 2nd SQR store c. 1911\nPhoto of the SQR Store in 1955\nArticle and photo of Wesley P.

        "content": "Garrison Lovely is an American journalist, whistleblower, and former employee of McKinsey & Company.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Coverage of McKinsey & Company ===\nLovely began his career in 2017 as an intern at McKinsey, and later became a full-time employee. He was assigned to projects for ICE and Rikers Island and other clients— this experience became crucial for some of his work.\nIn 2019, Lovely wrote an article in Current Affairs, originally published anonymously, which detailed former projects run by McKinsey, commented on the secretive office culture of the firm, and information on employee's access to luxury food and accommodations. The article was later attributed to Lovely.\nLovely interviewed R.E.M. frontman Michael Stipe in 2021 for Jacobin, touching on topics like apartheid, democratic socialism, and Stipes' upbringing as a military brat.\nIn 2022, CBS Sunday Morning ran a segment on Walt Bogdanich and Michael Forsythe's book, When McKinsey Comes to Town, which covers the firm's recruiting practices, its sway over global industries and its impact on information sharing. Lovely served as a source for the book along with fellow McKinsey alum Erik Edstrom; both were interviewed as part of the segment. Many of Bogdanich and Forsythe's other sources remained anonymous. Lovely covered similar subject matter in The Nation's September 2023 cover story \"Confessions of a McKinsey Whistleblower,\" which was subsequently translated & republished in Le Monde Diplomatique.\n\n\n=== Other reporting ===\nLovely has covered the environmental impact of pescatarian diets for Vox and the role of technological progress in metascience for BBC Future.\n\n\n=== Criticism ===\nThe National Review published an article in 2023 challenging Lovely's assessment of McKinsey, with particular attention to amorality in higher education systems, DEI and ESG corporate standards, and McKinsey's relationship with governments.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Copenhagen Steam Railway Galop (Danish: Kjöbenhavns Jernbane-Damp-Galop), often just called the Railway Galop (Danish: Jernbanegaloppen), is a musical composition by the Danish composer Hans Christian Lumbye (1810–1874) which was written to celebrate the opening of the Copenhagen–Roskilde railway line in 1847.\nIt is one of Hans Christian Lumbye's best known and popular works, and together with Lumbye's Telegraph Galop and Champagne Galop, it was included in the 2006 Danish Culture Canon as a masterpiece of Danish classical music.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Copenhagen Steam Railway Galop was composed for the opening of the Copenhagen–Roskilde railway line on 26 June 1847, the first railway line in the Kingdom of Denmark. The piece was performed for the first time on 29 June in Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe piece is a good example of the entertaining music Lumbye liked to compose. It faithfully recreates the sounds of a steam engine chugging out of a station and grinding to a halt at the next stop, traditionally ending with the cry \"Next stop Roskilde - the train does not go any further\".\n\n\n== Popularity ==\nFor a long time popular within Denmark, the piece has in recent years gained increasing popularity and was featured in the Vienna New Year's Concert in 2012. It's also been recorded multiple times, being included on over 20 albums.\n\n\n== See also ==\nVergnügungszug – a polka composed by Johann Strauss II in 1864 inspired by the opening of the Austrian Southern Railway\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On April 10, 1824, an explosion occurred in the Saint-Louis coal mine in Champagney, France. The explosion, called the first disaster at the Saint-Louis coal mine, was the first firedamp explosion in the Ronchamp and Champagney coalfields (Haute-Saône) and one of the first in France. It was also one of the deadliest in the history of the Ronchamp coal mines, killing twenty and injuring sixteen. The disaster had a profound impact on the local population and national opinion, calling into question the safety of firedamp mines and the conditions of ventilation.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn April 1824, on the north side of the Saint-Louis coal mine, not far from the Basvent adit, in a rugged terrain close to a geological fault, a coal exploration was organized. A strong release of firedamp occurred, which was mitigated by the installation of a fan and ventilation pipes. But this system proved ineffective, and the gas began to accumulate in the workings, which had been abandoned for two years, 50 meters from the shaft.In August 1821, according to the reports of the time and the civil mining engineer François Mathet (1823-1908), Mr. Parrot, mining engineer, first noticed the presence of firedamp in this mine while drilling the Cheval adit, a short distance from the outcrops. At that time, Mr. Parrot (again according to François Mathet) \"recommended that the operators take the precautions in use at the time, which consisted of igniting the firedamp that had accumulated at the top of the tunnels by a worker called Pénitent, who crawled along covered with wet cloths\". \nAccording to Mr. Combes, in a report to the Académie des Sciences entitled Physique du lobe - Sur le dégagement du grisou ou hydrogène carboné, dans les mines de charbon de terre (Physics of the lobe - On the release of firedamp or carbonized hydrogen in coal mines): \n\n\"According to a report by the mining engineers, the flammable gas was rarely seen in this mine and very small quantities; however, a small release had occurred shortly before the accident during a reconnaissance operation at the bottom of the Saint-Louis shaft (. ..)\".\n\n\n== Course of events ==\nOn April 10, 1824, the first firedamp explosion occurred in the Ronchamp coalfield, one of the first in France. Depending on the version, the explosion was caused either by contact with the flames of the lamps of the workers in the tunnel or by the presence of one of them in the old workings.\n\n\n== Outcome ==\nThe deflagration spread over a distance of 800 meters, killing twenty people, including a miner manager, injuring sixteen with varying degrees of seriousness, and destroying the mine. The tragedy had a major impact on the local population, not only because it was the first accident of its kind, but also because of the number of victims.\n\n\n== Consequences ==\n\nOn July 1, 1824, the Mining Board decided to mandate the first Davy safety lamp. On January 21, 1826, the state made the use of safety lamps compulsory, despite the opposition of the workers. Several exemptions watered down this measure.\nHowever, several other serious explosions occurred in the area, and the second disaster at the Saint-Louis coal mine claimed the lives of thirty miners on May 31, 1830.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nParietti, Jean-Jacques (2001).

        "content": "The Book of Articles is a list of allegations against Mary, Queen of Scots and James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell. The document was produced for the Westminster Conference in December 1568. The manuscript, held by the British Library, was written by Alexander Hay of Easter Kennett, and is sometimes known as Hay's Articles. The material resembles George Buchanan's published Detection and his Indictment of Mary. The text was published by John Hosack in 1869.\nA comparable document, held by Cambridge University Library, is known as Buchanan's \"Indictment\". The material may have been first composed in Latin and sent by Regent Moray to William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley. The historian John Guy calls this body of evidence against Mary \"Buchanan's dossier\".\n\n\n== Allegations ==\nThe Book of Articles has five sections. The first section describes the deterioration of Mary's relationship with Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley after three months of marriage. After the birth of James VI and I, Mary travelled to Alloa Tower without Darnley.\nThe second section outlines Mary's \"inordinate affection\" for Bothwell. She gave him lands, and then spent time with him in 1566 when she stayed in Exchequer House in Edinburgh's Cowgate and at John Balfour's house in the Canongate. Lady Rires brought Bothwell to her. Mary and Margaret Carwood helped Lady Rires scale a wall. Mary rode see Bothwell at Hermitage Castle when he was ill. For the baptism of James VI, she started to build a passage between her lodgings at Stirling Castle and Bothwell's.\nThe third section alleges a conspiracy for the murder of Lord Darnley. Mary was said to have first considered a divorce. Darnley's illness while travelling to Glasgow is said to be the result of poisoning. When Darnley came to the lodging at the Kirk o' Field in Edinburgh, she dined with Bothwell at Balfour's house. Her servant French Paris brought gunpowder to Darnley's lodging.\nThe fourth section describes the aftermath of the explosion that killed Darnley. Bothwell brought the news to the queen. An enquiring questioned Thomas Nelson, one of Darnley's servants. There were celebrations for the wedding of Margaret Carwood instead of mourning. Darnley was buried without ceremony. Mary played golf and pall-mall at Seton Palace with Bothwell. She married Bothwell on 15 May 1567 at Holyrood Palace.\nThe fifth section discusses the actions taken against Mary, the battle of Carberry Hill, the recovery of the casket letters, and Mary's abdication.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Erodium maritimum, the sea stork's-bill, is a herbaceous perennial plant in the family Geraniaceae. It occurs on free-draining stony soils close to the sea and, very occasionally, in similar situations inland. Most of the world's population occurs in southern Britain and Brittany, but it is found in scattered locations around the coast of Europe as far as Corsica and Italy, and south to the Canary Isles.\n\n\n== Description ==\nSea stork's-bill is a perennial monoecious herb which typically grows in rosettes pressed flat to the ground, with a deep tap root that allows it to survive through the summer on dry soils. The leaves are all or mostly basal, but are arranged in opposite pairs if the stem elongates. The leaves are simple, oval in outline, up to 2 cm long, shallowly lobed and quite strongly toothed, with a petiole that can be as long, or longer, than the blade. The surface of the leaf is streaked with long, white, appressed hairs.\n\nThe actinomorphic flowers are arranged singly (occasionally in pairs), arising from the middle of the rosette on short patent-hairy pedicels. The hermaphroditic flowers have five green, pointed, hairy sepals a few millimetres long and usually no petals at all, but sometimes small white petals about the same size as the sepals. If present, the petals fall soon after flowering. There are five stamens, and five carpels which develop into beaked mericarps that look like miniature storks bills, less than 1 cm long. The flowers are usually self pollinating.\n\n\n== Identification ==\nSea stork's-bill can be separated from other stork's-bills in the areas where it grows by the division of the leaves: common stork's-bill and sticky stork's-bill are twice-pinnate, musk stork's-bill is 1-pinnate, whereas sea stork's bill has simple leaves. Soft stork's-bill and Mediterranean stork's-bill also have simple leaves but, like the other three, both have large, persistent petals, whereas sea stork's-bill usually has none.\nFor technical confirmation, the pit at the apex of the mericarp is hidden by long hairs in sea stork's-bill, whereas it is generally visible in the other species.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nErodium maritimum was originally named Geranium maritimum by Linnaeus in 1763 but, together with several other similar species, it was transferred to the genus Erodium by the French botanist Charles Louis L'Héritier de Brutelle in Hortus Kewensis in 1789, on the basis that they only have 5 stamens, rather than the 10 of Geranium. A couple of other synonyms have been created over the years (i.e. similar plants were mistakenly thought to be new species) but they have never been widely used.\nIts chromosome number is 2n = 20.\nThere are no currently accepted subspecies or varieties, although several have been suggested in the past, and it is not known to hybridise with any other species.\nA 2012 study of the genetics of sea stork's-bill found that populations on the Atlantic coast of Europe lacked diversity, and plants throughout this area were all closely related to each other, as if long-distance dispersal events were frequent. However, no obvious mechanism for this dispersal was identified. The Sardinian population appeared to have a higher level of genetic variability, suggesting that this may be the ancestral population that has migrated west and north since the last Ice Age. The low levels of diversity might be due to founder effects, whereby a small number of individuals have given rise to the entire Atlantic seaboard population. \n\n\n== Distribution and status ==\nSea stork's-bill is almost entirely restricted to western Europe, where it has a very Atlantic distribution, mainly in south-western Britain, southern Ireland and Brittany. It extends to north-west Spain and the western Mediterranean to Italy. In north Africa it is found only in the Canary Islands (specifically, La Palma, Gran Canaria and Tenerife) and Tunisia (a specimen collected at Nabeul in 1884 is at the Paris Museum of Natural History) and it is known on the island of Zembra). Some sources suggest that it has been introduced to Tasmania, but a 2021 census of plants did not list it there.\n\nIts conservation status globally has not been assessed but in Britain, where it is most common, it is listed as LC (least concern) and it is clearly increasing in the south-east and East Anglia. Similarly, in mainland France it is generally classified as LC. It is restricted to a short stretch of coastline from the Cotentin Peninsula through Brittany to the Pays de la Loire; but it is considered VU (vulnerable) in Normandy and the Loire. The isolated population in Corsica is similarly listed as LC. By contrast it is considered to be Critically Endangered in Spain.\nIn some counties in Britain sea stork's-bill is considered to be an axiophyte, or species typical of valuable habitats. These are mostly the ones in the west, such as Cardiganshire, where it is found on stony slopes and screes on south-facing hillsides such as Foel y Mwnt, although it is also sometimes found in less natural places, including the station platform at Borth. Eastern counties, such as Kent, are less likely to consider it to be an axiophyte.\n\n\n== Habitat and ecology ==\nThe native habitat of sea stork's-bill is generally on rocky, stony ground near the sea, with free-draining soil. It is mesotrophic, calcifugous and xerophilic. In Britain it is considered to have an alternative habitat in short, acid grassland in inland places, but it has disappeared from most such situations. An exception is the Long Mynd in Shropshire, where it was found over 200 years ago by the Jamaican-English botanist Mary McGhie and is still present, in U1 sheep's sorrel grassland on a south-facing shale hillside, at an altitude of 220 m above sea level. Secondary populations occasionally appear on roadsides, railway lines, walls, in quarries and car parks, but these tend not to persist. In Corsica it occurs at all altitudes, from coastal dunes to over 1,500 m inland.\nAlthough it normally shuns alkaline soils, it is recorded as growing on limestone hills near Bristol. Where it does so is either \"overlooking salt water... or in valleys that were once arms of the sea; never inland,\" so it may be that the saline influence is more significant than the soil type.\nIts Ellenberg values in Britain are L = 9, F = 4, R = 6, N = 6, and S = 3, which supports the conclusion that it favours brightly lit places with low moisture, circumneutral acidity, moderate fertility, and high salinity.\nWhile it is potentially a perennial, sea stork's-bill often behaves as a spring annual, becoming abundant in a wet year and sometimes disappearing above ground in a dry summer.\nThe only vegetation community listed for sea stork's-bill in the European Habitats System is N34 \"Atlantic and Baltic soft sea cliffs\", for which it is a diagnostic species. This habitat is subject to protection under the Bern Convention. It is not mentioned in the British National Vegetation Classification.\nThere are as yet no known associations between insects and sea stork's-bill. It is commonly self-pollinating, but ants and flies are known to visit the flowers, although this apparently does not result in an increase in seed production. Seed dispersal is thought to be facilitated by endozoochory (specifically, being eaten but not digested by rabbits) and epizoochory (carried on the fur). Although it is sometimes described as occurring in gull colonies, studies have shown no evidence that the seeds are carried by seabirds.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first British record (as Geranium Betonicae folio, the geranium with leaves like betony) was made around 1666 by Christopher Merret, who found it \"over against Saint Vincent's Rocks... and at Bass Castle in Cornwall.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sweet Baby Inc. is a Canadian narrative development and consultation studio based in Montreal. Founded by former Ubisoft developers, including scriptwriter Kim Belair and product manager David Bédard, the company consults on video game narratives during development to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion within game narratives and studios. Sweet Baby has consulted with several developers and games, including Sable, God of War Ragnarök, and Alan Wake 2. In 2023, the studio became the target of online users who claimed it promoted a \"woke agenda\".\n\n\n== History ==\nSweet Baby Inc. was founded in Montreal in 2018 by former Ubisoft developers, including scriptwriter Kim Belair and product manager David Bédard. Belair became Sweet Baby's chief executive officer and Bédard the chief operating officer. Belair said that she founded the company to promote the advancement of women and marginalized groups in the video game industry.\n\nThe company consults on game narratives during development and promotes gender and racial diversity in the game development team. Sweet Baby's stated goal is to ensure that characters from different demographic groups are not only added to the game for nominal presence, which became common in the gaming industry in the 2020s, but that the portrayal of these characters is respectful, fits into the overall context and is written for quality scenarios. To achieve this goal, Sweet Baby organizes developer consultations with representatives of different ethnic groups and cultures when adding characters from these same cultures. Developer consultation with Sweet Baby starts from the earliest stage of development, beginning with addressing vacancies. While the studio can be consulted at any point in development, Belair felt it had a better chance at improvement by entering early to avoid undoing completed work.From 2018, Bédard was the brand content manager and Belair the story architect on Unknown 9, a transmedia project encompassing comics, novels, and video games, initially as employees of developer Reflector Entertainment and later as part of Sweet Baby. The studio consulted on the narrative and characters of God of War Ragnarök, focusing on making the black character Angrboda more relatable to black audiences while acknowledging the game's Norse mythology. Sweet Baby joined the development of Goodbye Volcano High in 2020 and led the narrative team after development rebooted in 2021.In 2022, the studio developed Lost Your Marbles for the Playdate handheld console, and formed two teams of around twelve people to assist in the development of two other Playdate games over the course of six months: Recommendation Dog and Reel Steel. Bédard felt undertaking two projects simultaneously was \"a bit too ambitious\" for the studio due to their differing production schedules. The studio joined Afterlove EP as consultants after the death of writer and designer Mohammad Fahmi in 2022, having been speaking with Fahmi before his death. Belair assisted Remedy Entertainment in refining the background and arc of Saga Anderson, the protagonist of Alan Wake 2, and worked with A44 Games in developing Nor Vanek, the protagonist of Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn. The studio joined the production of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League late in its development, focusing on writing audio logs, non-player character dialogue, and in-game advertisements. Sweet Baby was also involved in writing the script for Marvel's Spider-Man 2. As of 2024, Sweet Baby had 16 employees.\n\n\n== Online backlash and harassment ==\nIn October 2023, Sweet Baby attracted negative attention on Kiwi Farms, a web forum where a user described the company's involvement with Alan Wake 2 as \"possibly one of the biggest scandals in gaming history\"; similar posts were shared on sites like 4chan and the Reddit community r/KotakuInAction. Employees said a small degree of harassment was directed towards the company following this attention, which increased in January 2024, when a Steam user created a curator group listing Sweet Baby's work, encouraging players to avoid the games as the studio promoted a \"woke agenda\". The curator group, known as \"Sweet Baby Inc detected\", received increased attention in February when a Sweet Baby employee asked others to report it for violating Steam's code of conduct. The group's creator accused Sweet Baby of censorship. By April, the group had more than 355,000 followers and a related Discord server had thousands of members. Both underwent purges of content in order to stay online after Steam and Discord staff contacted their moderators about potentially violating terms of service, as much of the user-driven content in these forums bordered on hate speech. Belair said Sweet Baby did not contact Steam's owner, Valve, regarding the group.Theories about the studio included that it was directly or indirectly controlled by investment company BlackRock, that it forced Remedy to make Alan Wake 2's Saga Anderson black (which game director Kyle Rowley denied), and that it was responsible for recent failures in high-profile games such as Suicide Squad and for recent industry layoffs. Multiple journalists described these disproven ideas as conspiracy theories; several were based on isolated statements made by Sweet Baby employees on social media or at conferences, taken out of the larger context related to their views on diversity in game narratives. Aftermath's Nathan Grayson noted theories would likely continue spreading as long as their narrative compels viewers and readers; YouTube videos about the backlash collectively received millions of views. Belair responded that Sweet Baby's work was to improve narratives generally rather than being solely focused on diversity and inclusion; she noted gamers thought the studio had simply added pride flags to Marvel's Spider-Man 2 when it had actually provided narrative work for about three years, including several levels and character arcs.Sweet Baby's employees faced harassment and attempted doxing in response to the backlash, with attention drawn towards the company and its employees by high-profile social media accounts including Elon Musk, Matt Walsh, and Libs of TikTok. Others who faced harassment included Kotaku's reporter who first highlighted the backlash and developers who worked with or publicly supported Sweet Baby. Several journalists and content creators compared it to Gamergate, and TheGamer's Stacey Henley called it \"the latest dogwhistle for rejecting progressive ideas\". The Verge's Ash Parrish felt the Discord members were not attempting to \"create meaningful change for their cause\" but were \"simply there for the vibes, rancid though they are\". The studio continued to operate as normal; Bédard felt the industry had become familiar with similar controversies since Gamergate. Its partners, like Insomniac Games, offered advice on moving past the backlash based on their own experiences with harassment, and several developers and consultants, like Rami Ismail and Steve Saylor, supported the studio on social media. Journalists and academics urged the studio's other partners to publicly defend it to stop false accusations and avoid complicity, and Game Developer's Bryant Francis urged Steam and Discord to clarify their policies to avoid similar incidents and further harassment.\n\n\n== List of games ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Henry Plumptre (died 26 November 1746) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPlumptre was the second son of Henry Plumptre of Nottingham, by his second wife, Joyce (d. 1708), daughter of Henry Sacheverell of Barton, and widow of John Milward of Snitterton, Derbyshire. His grandfather, Huntingdon Plumptre, graduated with a B.A. from Trinity Hall, Cambridge, 1622, M.A. 1626, and M.D. 1631, was ‘accounted the best physician at Nottingham,’ and was the author of a rare work, ‘Epigrammaton Opusculum duobus Libellis distinctum,’ London, 1629, 12mo, which he dedicated to Sir John Byron; one copy was presented to Francis Prujean, and another to the library of St. John's College, Cambridge. He also translated Homer's ‘Batrachomyomachia’ into Latin verse (Wood, Fasti, ii. 194; Memoirs of Colonel Hutchinson, ed. Firth, passim; Nichols, Lit. Anecdotes, viii. 389; Notes and Queries, 3rd ser. viii. 470). The father Henry was implicated in a disturbance that arose out of James II's proceedings against the charter of Nottingham corporation, and at the trial his name afforded Jeffreys an opportunity for one of his brutal pleasantries. His elder son John was father of Robert Plumptre.\nHenry, born at Nottingham, was admitted a pensioner of Queens' College, Cambridge, on 19 Jan. 1697–8, and graduated B.A. in 1701–2, M.A. in 1705, and M.D. per literas regias in 1706. In the latter year he was one of those appointed by the university to carry a complimentary letter to the university of Frankfort on the occasion of its jubilee. On 15 February 1702–3 he was elected fellow of his college, but vacated the office by not taking orders on 4 July 1707. He was admitted a candidate of the College of Physicians on 22 Dec. 1707, and fellow on 23 Dec. 1708. He delivered the Gulstonian lectures in 1711, the Harveian oration in 1722, and on 19 March 1732–3 was appointed Lumleian lecturer. He was censor in 1717, 1722, 1723, and 1726, registrar from 1718 to 1722, treasurer on 13 July 1725, and consiliarius in 1735, 1738, and 1739. He was named an elect on 5 May 1727, and served as president for six years from 1740 to 1745. He was also physician at St. Thomas's Hospital, a post he resigned in 1736. He died on 26 November 1746 of an ulcer in his bladder. A portrait of Plumptre was presented by himself to the College of Physicians on 1 Oct. 1744. He was author of:\n\n‘Dissertatio Medico-Physica de Carolinis Thermis,’ Magdeburg, 1695, 4to; another edition, 1705, 4to.\n‘Oratio Anniversaria Harvæana,’ London, 1722, 4to.\nHe is also said to have written a pamphlet entitled ‘A serious Conference between Scaramouch and Harlequin,’ with reference to the controversy then raging between Dr. John Woodward and Dr. John Freind, and he devoted much time and energy to the fifth ‘Pharmacopœia Londinensis’ which appeared in 1746.\nHis son, Russell Plumptre (1709–1793), born on 4 January 1709, was admitted pensioner of Queens' College, Cambridge, on 12 June 1728, proceeded M.B. 1733, and M.D. 1738; he was admitted candidate of the College of Physicians on 30 September 1738, and fellow on 1 Octobter 1739. In 1741 he was appointed regius professor of physic at Cambridge. He died at Cambridge on 15 October 1793. His library was sold in 1796 (Mason's Gray, 1827, p. 328).\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Pollard, Albert Frederick (1896). \"Plumptre, Henry\".

Afterwards, he was employed as a researcher at the Institute for Wood Science and Technology (Dresden), where he worked during the years 1972–1992. In 1993 Niemz was elected as a professor at the University of Valdivia (today, Austral University of Chile) in Chile at the Institute of Wood Science and Technology and worked there until 1996.\nFollowing that, he moved to Switzerland, and in 1996 he acquired the position of full professor of wood physics at ETH Zurich. He was eventually retired in 2015. After that, he worked as a senior wood scientist at the Bern University of Applied Sciences in Biel.\nHis research focused on wood physics and wood material properties, and has received -until March 2024- more than 10,000 citations at Google Scholar. Additionally, he served on the editorial boards of esteemed wood-related journals, like Wood Material Science and Engineering and Holzforschung. He served also as a visiting professor at the University of Life Sciences in Warsaw and the Universität für Bodenkultur in Vienna.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nIn 2002, Niemz was elected as a fellow at The International Academy of Wood Science for his yearlong research and academic work.\nIn October 2023, a meta-research carried out by John Ioannidis et al. at Stanford University included Niemz in Elsevier Data 2022, where he was ranked in the top 2% of researchers of all time in wood science (forestry – materials), having a c-index of 3.0672.\nIn December 2023, along with Alfred Teischinger and Dick Sandberg, he coordinated and edited the referenced Springer Handbook of Wood Science and Technology.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nResearchGate",

        "content": "Peter-Paul Zahl (March 14, 1944, in Freiburg im Breisgau – January 24, 2011, in Port Antonio, Jamaica) was a German-born anarchist–libertarian writer and director. He last held dual German–Jamaican citizenship.\nHis extensive work, which includes lyric poetry, prose, and plays, is marked by the politicization of literature in West German society as a result of the 1968 movement. He was honored in 1980 for the picaresque novel Die Glücklichen and in 1995 for the crime novel Der schöne Mann.\nIn the late 1960s, he became known in West Berlin as the printer of the underground magazine Agit 883 and as a publisher and author of subcultural writings from the radical leftist social environment, which brought him into the focus of law enforcement.\nAfter critically wounding a police officer in a shootout while fleeing from police, he was imprisoned from 1972 to 1982. In 1976, the Düsseldorf District Court sentenced him to 15 years in prison for two counts of attempted murder. While in prison, Zahl intensified his literary work. He then became involved in cultural politics for the New Jewel Movement in Grenada and the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. From 1985 he lived primarily in Jamaica.\n\n\n== Life ==\n\n\n=== Childhood and youth ===\n\nZahl was born in Freiburg, Germany, in the penultimate year of World War II, the son of Hilde Zahl, a secretary, and Paul Zahl, a lawyer. His parents stayed there in 1944 when his father received medical treatment for a severe war injury and leg amputation. Towards the end of the war, the family moved back to their hometown of Feldberg in Mecklenburg with their one-year-old child, where the father founded the children's book publishing house Peter-Paul, named after his son, in 1947. The company was successful and soon became the second-largest children's book publisher in the GDR. As a privately owned company, however, it ran counter to state economic planning, and in 1951 Paul Zahl was denied a new license to continue the business. Due to further difficulties with the state authorities, the Zahl family moved to West Germany in 1953, settling first in Wülfrath and later in Ratingen in the Rhineland.\nThe family found it difficult to adapt to their new surroundings, as the father remained unemployed and there were problems with the payment of his war pension. About two decades later, Peter-Paul Zahl himself described the move to the West as the end of an \"extremely beautiful and happy childhood. He first attended high school in Velbert, then in Ratingen until he graduated from Mittlere Reife, before completing his apprenticeship as a small offset printer in Düsseldorf from 1961 to 1964, passing his journeyman's examination with a grade of \"very good\". During his apprenticeship, he was considered \"difficult\" and \"critical\" by his superiors. He was politically active, joining the Printing and Paper Union and the Conscientious Objection Society.\n\n\n=== West Berlin 1964—1972 ===\nIn 1964 Zahl moved his primary residence to West Berlin to avoid conscription, which was not implemented due to the Allied reservation of rights for citizens in the western sectors of the city. He worked as a printer and attended night school and lectures at the Free University of Berlin to become a writer. But he soon turned his back on institutional education: \"They don't teach you how to write anyway. On the contrary, they just mess up your style and your class consciousness. In 1965 he married his girlfriend Urte Wienen, also from his former hometown of Ratingen. The couple had two children, Raoul-Kostja, born on July 16, 1969, and Nadezhda, born in 1971. After the birth of their daughter, Zahl moved into a shared apartment. He was evicted from the apartment he shared with his wife because he was repeatedly not found in the marital household. The marriage ended in divorce in 1973.\nIn late 1965 Zahl supported an initiative by cabaret artist Wolfgang Neuss against the Vietnam War. Zahl's first publications of prose and poetry in magazines and on flyers also date from 1965. In 1966, he became a member of the Dortmunder Gruppe 61, a literary group initiated by Max von der Grün, whose aim was to create a link between writers and industrial workers. His first novel, From Someone Who Set Out to Earn Money, was published in 1970 by Karl Rauch Publishing House in Düsseldorf and received some public attention.\n\nIn 1965/66 he came into contact with the student movement, from which the then extra-parliamentary opposition (APO) developed. After the formation of the Grand Coalition between the CDU/CSU and the SPD under Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger in 1966/67 and the discussion about the Emergency Laws, the APO became a socially relevant opposition to the system with revolutionary aspirations. Zahl supported the principles of the movement, but refused to be associated with student-dominated organizations such as the Socialist German Students (SDS). He saw himself as part of a proletarian youth, a mixture of \"young workers, Kreuzberg bohemians, German army refugees, young booksellers\".\nWith the financial support of his parents-in-law, Zahl and his wife founded the Zahl-Wienen printing and publishing house in 1967 on Urban Street in Kreuzberg. In addition to corporate stationery and advertising, the company printed various publications and posters for the subcultural left-wing political scene. The publishing house mainly published countercultural magazines, such as the second issue of pro these in 1967. Zeitschrift für Unvollkommene by the astrologer Hans Taeger, as well as council communist and anarchist texts, including Spartacus: zeitschrift für lesbare literatur (1967–1970) and the magazine pp-quadrat (1968–1970). The first pp-quadrat volume contained the brochure amerikanischer faschismus by Bernd Kramer, another the description of Günter Wallraff's self-experiment with mescaline. The editions were often characterized by artistically designed collages, woodcuts and lithographs.\nZahl also wrote for the literary magazine Ulcus Molle Info and the satirical newspaper Der Metzger. With the zwergschul-ergänzungshefte, the publisher brought out a series between 1968 and 1970 with writings by revolutionary thinkers that were put up for discussion in the APO. The reprint of Georg Büchner's Hessian Courier from 1834, whose call \"Peace to the shacks! War on the palaces!\" was adopted as the slogan of the movement.\n\nFrom February 1969, the printing company produced the anarchist-libertarian magazine Agit 883, which Zahl was involved in editing until 1971. This reflected the fragmentation of the APO into different factions after its peak in 1967/1968. In numerous articles, it addressed the controversial question of the transition from protest to armed resistance, which had arisen in parts of the movement after the assassination attempt on Rudi Dutschke the previous year. When larger presses were purchased for the large-format newspaper – it was printed on DIN A2 plates – the company moved to more suitable premises at Weder Street 91 in Britz. In August 1969, after the publication of issue 25, the company was raided for the first time. This was because the then Senator of the Interior, Kurt Neubauer, was depicted on the cover with the words \"Wanted for kidnapping\", which was considered offensive by the authorities. Further searches followed as part of a criminal investigation into Agit 883, including the anti-Vietnam War texts in issue 61 of May 1970, which the commander of the American sector in Berlin had reported to the police. Zahl was acquitted of the charges brought against him because it could not be proven that he, as the printer, knew the text.\nAfter internal disputes within the magazine's editorial staff, Zahl left Agit 883 in 1971 and founded the underground anarchist magazine Fizz, which published ten issues until 1972. The magazine advocated the creation of an urban guerrilla movement and drew on American subcultural movements such as Black power and the Weather Underground. Fizz was considered the mouthpiece of the Berlin blues, especially the local group of so-called hash rebels. A large part of the violent Tupamaros West Berlin group, which was based on the concept of urban guerrilla warfare and merged with the 2 June Movement in early 1972, was recruited from this group.\nAs early as 1970 Zahl was involved in a small, clandestine organization called \"Up against the Wall, Motherfuckers!\" that specialized in forging passports for GIs stationed in Berlin who were unwilling to serve in the war to escape to Sweden.\nIn 1971 the authorities charged Zahl with public incitement to commit a crime and reopened the case against him. The case concerned a poster designed by future RAF member Holger Meins. It bore the title \"Freedom for All Prisoners!\" and had been confiscated from the print shop in May 1970. The image consisted of a sunflower stylized by a grenade and shell casings, with the names of international guerrilla and liberation movements such as the \"Vietcong\" in what was then South Vietnam, the Tupamaros in Uruguay, and the Black Panther Party in the U.S. inscribed on the petals. Zahl was sentenced to six months' probation on April 17, 1972.\n\n\n=== Imprisonment 1972–1982 ===\n\n\n==== Gunfight ====\nLater in 1972 Zahl came under suspicion of involvement in a bank robbery committed by the RAF in February of that year, but this could not be substantiated. He was put on the wanted list and declared a \"wanted person\". In the summer of that year, he obtained false papers and a firearm and went into hiding with friends and acquaintances. On December 14, 1972, while trying to rent a car in Düsseldorf, he was confronted by two police officers. Zahl attempted to flee and the officers pursued him. An exchange of gunfire ensued, during which Zahl fatally shot one of the officers in the chest. The fugitive eventually surrendered and was apprehended with a gunshot wound to his upper arm. Reconstructions of the crime, based on eyewitness testimony and recovered shell casings, indicate that Zahl fired at least three shots, and probably four and that the officers fired at least nine shots. When confronted with the serious injury to the policeman after his arrest, Zahl stated that he had not intended it. In an article on later efforts to reopen the case in February 1980, Der Spiegel concluded, based on the expert reconstruction of the events, that the intent to kill was doubtful and Zahl's testimony was credible.\n\n\n==== Convictions ====\n\nOn May 24, 1974, Zahl was sentenced by the Düsseldorf Regional Court to four years in prison for continued resistance to authority in connection with dangerous bodily injury. The court denied intent to kill, even in the form of conditional intent, saying: \"The taking of human life is not consistent with the personality\". After the prosecution appealed, the 3rd Criminal Senate of the Federal Court of Justice reversed the verdict in 1975 on the grounds that the court of first instance had \"misinterpreted the legal concept of conditional intent\". This is the case \"if the perpetrator consciously accepts that his action, which he does not want to renounce under any circumstances, can bring about the harmful result that he considers possible and not entirely remote\". In addition, the Düsseldorf Regional Court had to explain \"which circumstances could justify the defendant's expectations or even justifiable hopes that he would only injure his persecutors, but not kill them\".\nIn a new trial before the Düsseldorf Regional Court on March 12, 1976, Zahl was sentenced to a total of 15 years in prison for two counts of attempted murder. The court agreed with the Federal Court of Justice and found it proven that the defendant had \"condoned\" the killing of the two policemen. He had \"undoubtedly recognized\" that there was \"the possibility of fatal injuries\" as a result of the shots he fired, and had also \"approved\" of this if it occurred. The characteristics of murder under\n§ 211\nStGB (in German)\nwere to be seen in the fact that the defendant sought to conceal the crimes of forgery, unauthorized possession of weapons and dangerous bodily harm.\nIn his closing remarks Zahl spoke of the \"fascization of West German society\" and the \"policing of politics. After a lengthy discourse on how violence emanates from the state, he said, in response to a quote from Walter Benjamin, that where capital, the state, and bureaucracy rule, there can be no non-violent agreement. Finally, he declared that anyone \"as dangerous\" as he was being portrayed \"must be physically destroyed if he dares to continue fighting for life and human dignity, even in prison. If not through the chimney, then at least – 15 years\". In the second sentence the court applied the maximum 15-year term, citing Zahl's political background and stating that the defendant was \"gripped by a deep hatred of our state.\nThe verdict sparked a public controversy, with the author himself describing it as an \"11-year sentence\". Writing in the weekly Die Zeit on February 11, 1977, Fritz J. Raddatz asked how the chambers of the District Court could come to such different verdicts. Even though he did not call for a carte blanche for \"freaks who shoot themselves free,\" one could not help but get the impression \"that here, in addition to the condemnation of an act, an attitude is also being punished. Five months later, in July 1977, the journalist Gerhard Mauz contradicted this in the news magazine Der Spiegel; Zahl had not experienced a special \"terror sentence,\" but rather what other criminals had experienced: \"He came up against the legal concept of conditional intent\".\nThe poem im namen des volkes, in which Zahl expressed his view of the condemnations in literary form, was frequently quoted in commentaries:\n\n\n==== Sentence ====\nDuring the first years of his sentence, Zahl was held in solitary confinement, first in Cologne-Ossendorf prison, then in Werl Prison beginning in 1977, and occasionally in Bochum prison. He considered himself a political prisoner and took part in several collective hunger strikes for better prison conditions organized by RAF prisoners who were also serving time in various prisons at the time. He used his time in prison to produce an extensive literary output, which he commented on as having ensured his survival. In 1974, a novel manuscript he sent to a publisher from prison, titled Isolation, was barred from publication by a court order because its publication might jeopardize the security and order of the prison. This led to public protests by the PEN Center Germany and the Association of German Writers. The text was published in 1979 under the editorship of the literary scholar Ralf Schnell in the volume Schreiben ist ein monologisches Medium. Dialoge mit und über Peter-Paul Zahl.\nIn February 1980, the Rudolf Alexander Schröder Foundation awarded the imprisoned writer the City of Bremen Literature Prize for his novel Die Glücklichen. He was allowed to leave prison for the award ceremony and accept the prize in person. The event was publicly discussed as a \"cultural-political scandal. In 1980 Zahl was transferred to Tegel Prison correction in Berlin. He was released from prison in 1981 and was able to use this status for an internship as a director at the Berlin Schaubühne in 1981/1982. During this time he also wrote a play about Georg Elser, which premiered in the 1981/1982 season at the Schauspielhaus Bochum. He was able to attend the premiere on February 27, 1982, because he received prison furlough.\nIn December 1982, Peter Paul Zahl was released from prison after serving two-thirds of his sentence. Previously, a petition for retrial had been denied in November 1980, and a petition for clemency supported by Heinrich Böll, Ernesto Cardenal, and other prominent cultural figures had been denied in April 1981.\n\n\n=== Central America 1983 to 2011 ===\nAfter his release from prison, Peter-Paul Zahl refrained from political activities in West Germany. In an interview with the Die Tageszeitung (taz) in the mid-1990s, he explained that otherwise, he would have violated the terms of his parole. He had experienced the squatter demonstrations as an incredibly exciting time, but also the militancy of the police: \"I allowed Germany to actively repent, but it didn't pass the parole. [...] I can't prove myself for five years, if I go along with it, I'll end up back in prison\".\n\nInstead, he accepted several invitations from abroad. He supported various neo-Marxist movements in Central America, such as the New Jewel Movement led by Maurice Bishop in the southeastern Caribbean island nation of Grenada and the SNLF in Nicaragua. Zahl accepted a request from the Grenadian Ministry of Education to establish a theater, but was expelled from the country after the U.S. invasion in 1983. In 1984, he attended the Tuscany Summer University in Italy and spent time in the Seychelles.\nOn the recommendation of Ernesto Cardenal, Nicaragua's Minister of Culture during the 1979–1987 revolution, Zahl took over the training of actors and directors at a popular culture center in Bluefields on the Caribbean coast in 1985. He left after seven months because, he says, he had problems with the racism and machismo of the Sandinista hardliners. Despite these relatively disappointing experiences, Zahl remained committed to his preferred interpretation of the Caribbean lifestyle. In 1985, he settled in Long Bay, Portland, Jamaica. In an interview, he explained that he appreciated the laziness of the country, \"so if you want to do a little bit of easy going, Jamaica is the ideal country for that. The people here are anarchoid, which means they hate authority and are very anti-authoritarian and therefore very strong-willed.\n\nIn 1986, he married for the second time. His wife gave birth to a daughter in December of that year. In the years that followed, Zahl and his family moved several times between Long Bay and Ratingen in the Rhineland. According to some author profiles, he has a total of nine children in five different countries, including three stepdaughters. During his regular visits to Germany, Zahl worked on theater productions and undertook reading tours. He continued to publish prose and poetry, wrote plays for German theaters, and began writing crime novels in 1994.\nIn 1995, Peter-Paul Zahl was naturalized in Jamaica without first obtaining permission to retain his German citizenship. As a result, he automatically lost his German citizenship under German law. In September 2002, the German Embassy in Kingston confiscated his passport. Following an application for renaturalization, the Federal Office of Administration in Cologne issued him a certificate of naturalization on November 8, 2004; the Federal Foreign Office issued him a passport in May 2005. However, on April 19, 2006, the Administrative Court of Berlin, before which Zahl had filed a lawsuit, ruled that the loss of German citizenship did not occur in 1995 because Zahl still had a residence in Germany at that time and therefore would not have required a residence permit under the \"domestic clause\" in effect until 2000. Zahl continued to hold Jamaican citizenship after his renaturalization.\nPeter-Paul Zahl died on January 24, 2011, at the age of 66 in a Port Antonio hospital after undergoing treatment for cancer in Jamaica and Germany the previous year.\n\n\n== Literary work ==\nPeter-Paul Zahl's literary works include poems, essays, novels and plays, as well as social reportages, appeals, articles and pamphlets. He is best known for his state-critical poems and his novel Die Glücklichen. Ein Schelmenroman, was written in prison and published in 1979. He wrote for the Rotbuch Publishing House in Berlin. On the occasion of his 65th birthday in 2009, and even more so in numerous obituaries in 2011, the German media paid tribute to his entire oeuvre. His work was described as deeply political but undogmatic, and he was considered the bad boy of the literary scene, according to editor Gabriele Dietze, because he did not fit into any cliché. His irony and, in particular, his self-irony, as well as his \"very humorous relationship to his own text\" are emphasized. In his prose, Peter-Paul Zahl \"liked to explore the abysses of good society and [set] monuments to the little lawbreakers,\" according to the philologist Wolfgang Harms. He was not considered a political theorist or a great thinker, but a clever and talented writer and a good storyteller. Many of his publications are \"shrill, aggressive, almost unbearably poster-like [...] with pointed lances,\" as the columnist Fritz J. Raddatz wrote in 1977, but they speak of a \"disappointment disguised as laconicism, a shrug of the shoulders.\n\nBecause of his biography and the contexts in which his work was created, Zahl has been compared to François Villon, Blaise Cendrars, and Miguel de Cervantes, with a clear reference to his literary activities during imprisonment and detention. The search for parallels to Erich Mühsam and Ernst Toller also seems politically obvious, with particular reference to Toller's Swallow book, written in prison in 1924, to which Peter-Paul Zahl's prison poetry is not inferior. Zahl himself often referred to Georg Büchner and Walter Benjamin in his writings, and he had a special admiration for Friedrich Hölderlin. In the mid-1970s, for example, he supported the initially controversial publication of the Frankfurt Hölderlin Edition by D. E. Sattler with an open letter in the Blättern zur Frankfurter Ausgabe No. 1:\n\n\"Why do you close your ears? Why do you block your pores? – Why do you close your eyes? Why, damn it, do you defend yourselves against tenderness and beauty and their derivatives in language [...]? Come on, sisters and brothers, you have more time than you think, read Hölderlin, listen to what he has to tell us. It is worth it.\"\nZahl published mainly in underground presses, but also with renowned houses such as Rowohlt, Luchterhand, and Wagenbach. However, his \"reputation as a political activist\" overshadowed his literary standing, and in the end \"the established literary establishment increasingly shunned him,\" wrote Jörg Sundermeier in the taz in 2011.\n\n\n=== Early work ===\nPeter-Paul Zahl's first surviving publications are two so-called Spartacus flyer poems from 1966. They were designed as large-format wall posters and were used to advertise lyrical texts, here under the headings Berufsethos and The Chimney Mason. Both were included in the collection of historical documents at the German Historical Museum in Berlin. In 1968 he published the story Eleven Steps to a Deed; the Polyphem publishing house, printed the book with eleven lithographs by the artist Dora Elisabeth von Steiger as a limited and numbered hand-pressed print.\nZahl's first novel, From Someone Who Set Out to Earn Money, was published in 1970 and is about a young man who cannot find work in a rural area and comes to West Berlin. In the city, he is frustrated by personal and political circumstances, moves further \"east\" and is sent back from there as undesirable. The first work found its way into the literary criticism of the news magazine Der Spiegel, which emphasized that the literarily neglected theme of wage labor could also be treated with new stylistic devices, contrary to the outdated concept of realism. These are not merely rhetorical; the book is designed with contextual collages of photos, drawings, and headlines. The concluding statement is: \"But this piece of agitational literature overtaxes the reader...\"\nZahl published additional texts between 1968 and 1970, especially in the series of zwergschul-ergänzungshefte, which he edited himself. The epilogue to issue no. 4, which contained a reprint of Georg Büchner's Hessischer Landbote from 1834, is regarded as Zahl's political statement. He considered the social-revolutionary significance of Büchner's pamphlet to be as important as that of Karl Marx's Communist Manifesto, published in 1848; moreover, these \"eloquent documents of German revolutionaries\" were \"glaringly topical\" for the oppressed classes.\n\n\n=== Literary work in prison ===\nThe time in prison from 1972 to 1982 was one of Peter-Paul Zahl's most productive creative periods. He said: \"I wrote an insane amount in prison. To survive better, [...] translations, essays, the novel Die Glücklichen, a huge number of complaints, poems.\nIn addition to the novel Die Glücklichen and the play Johann Georg Elser. Ein deutsches Drama, several collections of essays and articles, as well as five volumes of poetry and two volumes of prose. The writer Michael Buselmeier describes his poetry as specific and explicit politics, an expression of the failure of the anti-authoritarian movement. He subordinates his poetry to political strategies through a closed conceptual system as a worldview. Accordingly, for Zahl, resistance is not an existential-biographical experience, but a collective resistance to which operative literature must call.\n\nStarting in 1973, Zahl wrote Die Glücklichen, which was published in 1979 and, as the subtitle suggests, belongs to the genre of the picaresque novel. The heroes of the story live in the milieu of a Kreuzberg gangster family, the narrative perspective takes the side of a marginalized and socially underprivileged class imagined by Zahl. At the same time, however, it is a subjective depiction of the upheaval of the 1968 movement, torn between state repression and the escalation of its own political issues. Thus, the debate about an armed struggle in the underground is a central issue; the protagonists criticize the RAF and the June 2 Movement as an isolated \"fighting avant-garde\". The \"myth of the RAF\" is contrasted with the subversive activities of the main characters, who work in the neighborhoods of anarchist circles that consider themselves \"sub proletarian,\" found a party against work, and published the magazine The Happy Unemployed. This is inserted between the ninth and tenth chapters as a 25-page typescript designed by comic artist Gerhard Seyfried, just as the entire novel is interspersed with collages, newspaper clippings, and drawings, and interspersed with various stylistic forms and factual texts. The narrative also thrives on the tension between the fiction of a sensual, worldly subcultural collective and the author's detached situation in solitary confinement.\nIn the 1980s, the novel became a cult book for an alternative left-wing scene that was influenced by the events of 1968 and \"began to break away from the self-destructive actionism of the RAF. The radio editor Sabine Peter described it as a \"textual drug, which in all its wit also shows a decisive anger at social conditions\". Thirty years after its publication, Die Glücklichen was classified as a work of Culture of Remembrance; according to the literary scholar Jan Henschen, Peter-Paul Zahl had \"staged a myth of origin, he had tried to make history accessible to himself and his generation.\n\n\n=== Stage works ===\nDuring his last two years in prison, Zahl wrote the play Johann Georg Elser. Ein deutsches Drama. He took up the story of Georg Elser (1903–1945), a carpenter who had received little public attention until then, but who on November 8, 1939, bombed Adolf Hitler in the Munich Bürgerbräukeller and was murdered in the Dachau concentration camp shortly before the end of the war. The play was a memorial to the long-ignored resistance fighter. In addition, Zahl \"took German fascism out of the exoticism of the 'completely different' and showed its frightening proximity and topicality. The play was directed by Claus Peymann and Hermann Beil at the Schauspielhaus Bochum in the 1981/1982 season and premiered under the direction of Alfred Kirchner on February 27, 1982. Critics emphasized both the importance of Elser and the fact that it was brought to light by the imprisoned writer. Der Spiegel wrote: \"Zahl, who once wanted to be a hero and a martyr, has portrayed a hero and a martyr in his 'Elser'. And he has succeeded – despite all the political baggage.\nZahl's later stage works received neither the attention nor the respect that the Elser play had received. Mit Fritz, a German Hero oder Nr. 477 bricht aus, a play for young people, premiered at the Mannheim National Theatre on February 12, 1988, under the direction of René Geiger. It is a portrayal of the appropriation of Friedrich Schiller by politicians and Germanists of all eras. Zahl wrote the 1990 comedy Die Erpresser together with the Austrian singer-songwriter Georg Danzer, who set the play to music and wrote three of the lyrics. It was torn apart by critics, here in the taz, as an \"adolescent slapstick play with old political jokes, gentlemanly jokes and pompous agitprop monologues. Don Juan oder der Retter der Frauen is also a comedy that Zahl created based on motifs by Tirso de Molina. It premiered on June 20, 1998, as part of the Heidenheim Folk Theatre.\n\n\n=== Jamaican influence ===\nIn 1994, Zahl published his first crime novel, The Handsome Man, which won the Friedrich Glauser Prize a year later. In it, the author created the character of Jamaican private detective Aubrey Fraser, known as Ruffneck or Ruff, who is portrayed as a fun-loving bon vivant, modeled on Dashiell Hammett. Five more titles featuring this protagonist followed through 2005. The series has been praised by critics as \"an excellent introduction to the island,\" providing a look at the country and its people, its history, colonial past, and social conditions. In addition to the plot, it describes \"the beautiful country with its people, customs and peculiarities, the taste and smell of the local cuisine,\" but it also denounces its dark side, the entanglements of violence, politics and corruption.\nIn the 1999 children's book Ananzi ist schuld and the 2003 collection of short stories Anancy Mek It, Zahl drew on the character of Anancy, a spider with typical trickster attributes rooted in Jamaican mythology. Zahl has also written a cookbook on Caribbean cuisine (1998) and a travel guide to his adopted country (2002).\nZahl published a second picaresque novel, Der Domraub, in 2002. Set in Germany, it tells the story of a Belgrade-born art thief in the role of a small, likable crook who is persuaded by shady agents to rob the treasury of Cologne Cathedral. In the end, he becomes a scapegoat for other underworld thieves and state institutions who all want to put him in jail. According to literary critic Maike Albath, the novel is to be understood as a \"satirical reckoning with the jurisdiction of the Federal Republic of Germany,\" but the author takes it too easy when he tries to create a hero who takes up arms against the system with a few old-fashioned platitudes and corny jokes.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nDuring his lifetime, the reception of his work was generally overshadowed by reflections on his person and controversies surrounding his condemnations. This polarization is still evident in the obituaries. While Die Welt Kompakt described him in January 2011 as an anarchist author and propagandist for left-wing terrorist groups, the Frankfurter Rundschau on the same day referred to him as a political prisoner who had spent many years in prison because of a judicial scandal.\nIn May 1976, the historian Golo Mann and the literary critic Marcel Reich-Ranicki had an argument about the relationship between the person and the work. After the announcement of the controversial second verdict against Zahl, the FAZ printed his poem mittel der obrigkeit in the Frankfurter Anthologie series founded by Reich-Ranicki:\n\nThe publication was accompanied by a commentary by the poet Erich Fried. In a letter dated May 26, 1976, Golo Mann asked, \"How could you spoil the hitherto so successful 'Frankfurt Anthology' and publish the wretched stuff of this policeman's murderer, together with the corresponding commentary by Mr. Fried? Reich-Ranicki's answer of May 31, 1976 was: \"As far as the poem by the policeman's murderer is concerned, I think the sentence comes from Wilde that the fact that someone does not pay his bill does not prove that he plays the violin badly.\n\n\n=== Dealing with the RAF ===\n\nIn a 2003 article entitled Literatur und Terror, journalist and writer Enno Stahl examines the reception of the RAF in literature and notes that the \"agitated atmosphere\" of the 1970s means that there is still a stigma attached to dealing with the subject. One of the reasons for this is \"the mythical exaggeration of the RAF's actual effectiveness and theoretical basis, in both negative and positive terms. Peter-Paul Zahl's Die Glücklichen was one of the first novels to deal explicitly with this topic. As the printer of Agit 883 and co-editor of Fizz, he was familiar with the development of \"radical leftist milieus, especially in Berlin. The novel traces this process and at times attempts to deal with the RAF and the June 2 movement. The author treats them with \"an attitude of critical sympathy\"; he does not fundamentally doubt the legitimacy of violence, but wants to see it \"emanate from the people themselves:\n\n\"The question is not: legal or illegal? The question is: is this counter-violence mass, does it have a goal, is it legitimized by grassroots democracy? The insurrection, the uprising, is not the social revolution. The concept of insurrection is a concept of the political mind; the classical period of the political mind is the French Revolution, Marx, Critical Marginal Glosses, the RAF's concept of revolution is a bourgeois one.\"\nIn doing so, Zahl is attacking the \"avant-garde of the revolutionary struggle\", whose actions are not morally questionable, but politically wrong. By demythologizing the RAF, however, he simultaneously constructs a new myth by placing the \"lumpenproletariat\" and the fun guerrillas he imagines on the good side of a black-and-white picture of society.\nIn a 2008 study, literary scholar Sandra Beck also analyzes the question of the literary treatment of West German terrorism, taking Zahl's novel as an example of a text written under the direct impression of the German Autumn. She points to the media stylization of the author as \"RAF liaison\" and \"head of the June 2nd Movement,\" which began in the 1970s and led to his works being \"received from the perspective of the 'terrorist writer. Beck addresses the novel's detailed descriptions of the political development of the radical left; the protagonists locate themselves in a shared past with the RAF and conduct the discussion of the legitimacy of violence in direct confrontation with quoted, \"publicly banned writings. They reject terrorism because it practices the same unconditional violence as the system it opposes, \"so that creativity, autonomy and the satisfaction of pleasure are replaced by brutality, discipline and dogmatism. Literature opens up an aesthetic space in fictional dialogue and immediately makes it clear \"that this discursive confrontation with the terrorism of the RAF is only possible in the medium of fiction.\n\n\n=== Prison literature ===\n\nIn 1977, Erich Fried founded the Peter-Paul Zahl Initiative Group, which published documentation on the case and lobbied for the reopening of the trial. When a planned proseminar on the imprisoned writer was banned by the administration of the Westphalian Wilhelms University in Münster in 1979, Fried spoke out against the ban at a protest event:\n\n\"Of course, incarceration alone does not turn a bad poem into an important literary work, but deprivation of liberty as such should not make a poet unsuitable for a seminar.\"\nIn a subsequent lecture on prison literature, he explained that writing produced in prisons is part of a \"respectable international tradition,\" with Fyodor Dostoyevsky as the best-known example. The importance of prison literature lies in its reflection of social conditions. Texts – especially those written by those imprisoned for political reasons, and in this particular case the poetry of Peter-Paul Zahl – served not only as an attempt to survive but also as a resistance to institutional violence.\nZahl's poem Prisoner's Dream is also interpreted in this sense:\n\nPrison poetry offers a chance to learn about the inner world of prisons, but at the same time there is a danger of blurring the lines between right and wrong, judge and defendant, \"outside\" and \"inside.\nInspired by this debate, Helmut H. Koch, a professor of German studies, took up the topic of \"obviously explosive literature,\" founded the Documentation Center for Prisoner Literature at the Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster in the early 1980s, and is the co-initiator of the Ingeborg Drewitz Prize for Prisoner Literature, which was established in 1988. Koch sees prison literature as a necessary complement to established literature to make visible the reality of prisons, which is largely ignored by society.\n\n\n=== Work and indolence ===\n\nIn an essay published posthumously in 1980, Rudi Dutschke, one of the most prominent spokespersons of the APO, compared some aspects of the work of the Vormärz writer Georg Büchner with that of Peter-Paul Zahl. He saw both as radical oppositional poets who had created a literature of resistance. Zahl had been influenced by Büchner's existentialist understanding of resistance, which he had developed at an early age. In contrast, he described Zahl's early poetry as \"existentialist resistance poetry, essentially individualistic. In the period after 1968, Zahl's importance lay in his role as a chronicler of the anti-authoritarian movement. His publications, and even more so his life story, made it possible to relativize and concretize one's view of one's own history.\nIn addition to comparing the two writers' positions on revolutionary defeats and questions of love, Dutschke's essay focuses on their examination of work as a social category. In his work, Büchner often takes an anticipatory stand against wage slavery; the question is whether Zahl's comments on happy unemployment are to be understood in the same sense as precursors of future working methods. He cites Büchner as an example:\n\n\"Our life is murder by work; we hang on the rope for sixty years and struggle, but we will cut ourselves loose!\"\nZahl takes up this radical negation of work in general and wage labor in particular. The alienated and oppressive process is already present in the description of work processes in the novel From Someone Who Set Out to Earn Money, and the language of Büchner's worker types echoes in it:\n\n\"… ... if you're lucky, you'll be with yourself, but you'll probably be too tired.\"\nDutschke stated that \"a voice was heard in this novel that did not correspond to the conventional name of 'student movement,' which was promoted in a dominant and class-conscious manner.''\nZahl's view of the refusal to work as a fundamental condition for the liberation of human developmental needs is even clearer in his essay Indolence instead of/or work, which stands in the best tradition of Büchner, but also of Paul Lafargue's The Right to Be Lazy. Zahl tried to link Lafargue and Bakunin with Marx and Engels, which earned him the accusation of subjectivism from parts of the Marxist left. Dutschke accused them of not knowing the categories of life and leisure time in Marx's work.\nIn the novel Die Glücklichen, Zahl explicitly and centrally refers to Büchner's understanding of work and indolence. With the closing words from the comedy Leonce and Lena, he introduces the narrative of a permissive, free-spirited, pleasure-oriented concept of life of the protagonists, who practice anarcho-libertarian socialism and oppose rigorous dogmatism:\n\n\"We will have all clocks smashed, all calendars forbidden, and we will count hours and moons only by the flower clock, only by blossom and fruit. [...] and a decree will be issued that anyone who forms calluses on his hands will be placed under curatorship; anyone who works himself sick will be criminally punished; anyone who prides himself on eating his bread by the sweat of his brow will be declared insane and dangerous to human society.\"\nDutschke remarked on this quotation that Büchner fundamentally transcends petite bourgeoisie thinking in the Marxist sense. The literary scholar Sandra Beck takes up this comparison and explains that Zahl thus opens up an intertextuality and places the alternative described in a fairy-tale world, very much in the tradition of Büchner's fairy-tale play. Failure is anticipated because the protagonists are not removed from time, but find themselves in a conflicted relationship with the outside world. This \"undermines the concrete ideal in the recourse to Büchner's The Hessian Courier.\n\n\n=== Musical reception ===\nIn October 1978, musicians from the Viennese band Schmetterlinge and the Hamburg political rock group Oktober set texts from Zahl's 1977 poetry collection All Doors Open to music and recorded an album. In addition to six songs, flamenco guitarist Miguel Iven recorded the twenty-minute piece Ninguneo, a musical text about the assassination of poet Federico García Lorca. Participating musicians included Kalla Wefel, Andreas Hage, Beatrix Neundlinger, Ali Husseini, and Willi Resetarits.\nHamburg musician Achim Reichel set Zahl's poem Bessie kommt to music on his 1980 album Ungeschminkt. Composers Holger Münzer and Heiner Goebbels are also known to have set Zahl's texts to music.\nThe band Das Lunsentrio released the song Reggae for Peter-Paul Zahl on the album 69 ways to play pub rock in 2021.\n\n\n== Work overview (Selection) ==\n\n\n=== Poetry and short story collections ===\n\n\n=== Novels and stage works ===\n\n\n=== Crime novels in the Fraser series ===\n\n\n=== More prose ===\n\n\n=== Radio plays and records ===\nLyrik und Jazz, 1980\nSumpf, 1982\nRollberg, SFB, 1984 (Radio play)\nMacht hoch die Tür …, 1985\n\n\n=== Translations ===\nVictor Serge: Geburt unserer Macht (Original title: Naissance de notre force), Tricont, Munich 1976, ISBN 3-920385-93-4.\nOtto René Castillo: Selbst unter der Bitterkeit, Poems (Original title: Aun bajo la amargura Co-translator: Reinhard Thoma), Information point Guatemala, Munich 1983, ISBN 3-923872-00-3 (Contains: Only those who love are consistent).\nRamón José Sender: Sieben rote Sonntage (Original title: Siete Domingos rojos), Rotpunkt, Zurich 1991, ISBN 3-85869-063-5.\n\n\n== Prizes and awards ==\n1979/1980: Literature Prize of the city of Bremen\n1995: Friedrich Glauser Prize of the \"Authors' group for German-language crime fiction\" – The Syndicate\n1998: Scholarship from the state of North Rhine-Westphalia\nThe building of the Department of German Studies, which was occupied during a lecture strike at the Free University of Berlin in the winter semester of 1976/77, was temporarily renamed the Peter-Paul-Zahl-Institut as part of this action.

        "content": "Stephen (I) Nagymihályi (Hungarian: Nagymihályi (I.) István; died after 1384) was a Hungarian nobleman in the 14th century, who served as vice-ispán of Szatmár County in 1367.\n\n\n== Family ==\nStephen (I) was born into the Nagymihályi family, which possessed landholdings in Northeastern Hungary, mostly Ung and Zemplén counties, and is considered the senior linage of the Nagymihály branch of the gens (clan) Kaplon. His father was Andrew (II), one of the sons of the influential lord Jakó Kaplon. Stephen had two brothers, Emeric and Nicholas (I). Stephen married Helena Szeretvai. She was a daughter of Ramocsa, the progenitor of the Ramocsa de Szeretva family. Helena was mentioned as Stephen's widow in 1398.\n\n\n== Life ==\nStephen is first mentioned by contemporary records in 1335, when took part in the process of division of the clan's estates along with several other family members in 1335. Two years later, in 1337, the Jakó's branch itself further divided its possessions within the family between the sons of Andrew (II) – i.e. Emeric, Stephen and Nicholas – and their cousins, the sons of Ladislaus (I). Thereafter, Stephen also possessed portions in the estates Nagymihály and Tiba (present-day Michalovce and Tibava in Slovakia, respectively). In the subsequent years, Stephen, alongside his brothers, was involved in various lawsuits regarding the possessions of his family, against his neighbors and also other branches of the Nagymihályis.\nStephen entered the service of Palatine Nicholas Zsámboki by the year 1351. Sometime after, he became a familiaris of Simon Meggyesi. In this capacity, he served as castellan of Izdenc Castle in Križevci County (today ruins near Veliki Zdenci, Croatia) in 1357. Under Meggyesi, Stephen was styled as vice-ispán of Varaždin County in 1360. When Meggyesi was appointed ispán of Szatmár County in 1367, Stephen followed his lord becoming his deputy. It is possible he functioned as vice-ispán until 1369.\nIn 1376, Catherine Butkai, Emeric's wife and Stephen's sister-in-law was murdered. Her mother accused Emeric and Stephen hiring a servant to kill the woman, then her body was buried outside the cemetery and all her chattels were taken. In March 1376, Palatine Nicholas Garai ordered a criminal investigation by entrusting the monastery of Lelesz (today Leles, Slovakia) with this task. A month later, Emeric appeared before the investigate body and claimed that he murdered his wife alone, after allegedly she was caught in adultery by himself. In 1379, Emeric (and his brother Stephen) negotiated with the mother of Catherine regarding the chattels (mostly cloathes) of the murdered wife, the trial was not yet concluded. King Louis I of Hungary determined that if the jury cannot reach a decision, then Emeric and his brother must prove with an oath that Catherine was guilty of adultery. From a charter of King Sigismund from 1419, it can be concluded that Emeric was acquitted of the charge because he legally killed his wife due to the fact of adultery, thus the Butkais were unable to recover her wealth.\nLouis I confirmed Stephen's right to possess Tiba in full nobility (i.e. without any tax burden) in 1377, together with other members of his kinship. The charter refers to him as a magister. Stephen died sometime after 1384. His marriage produced three children: Andrew (V), Ladislaus (IV) and Stephen (II). The last living branch of the Nagymihályi family, which became extinct in 1449, descended from Ladislaus (IV). Stephen's namesake son, Stephen (II) was killed in the Battle of Nicopolis in 1396, together with distant relative John Tibai.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==",

        "content": "Charles Goodall (1642 – 23 August 1712) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGoodall was born in Suffolk in 1642, studied medicine at Leyden, and graduated M.D. at Cambridge 26 Nov. 1670. He then went to reside in London, attended some of the anatomical lectures of Dr. Walter Needham (The Colledge of Physicians vindicated, p. 66), and was admitted a candidate, a grade corresponding to the present degree of member, at the Royal College of Physicians on 26 June 1676. Earlier in the same year he had published ‘The Colledge of Physicians vindicated, and the True State of Physick in this Nation faithfully represented.’ This work is a reply to an attack on the college by Adrian Hyberts, and proves three points: that the College of Physicians was legally established, that it exercised its rights justly, and that it had advanced medical learning in England. The illustrations in support of the last show Goodall to have been well read in the science of his time. On 5 April 1680 he was elected a fellow of the College of Physicians, delivered the Gulstonian lectures there in 1685, and the Harveian oration in 1694 and 1709. He was censor in 1697, 1703, 1705, and 1706, and president from 1708 till his death. In 1684 he published ‘The Royal College of Physicians of London founded and established by law,’ and ‘An Historical Account of the College's Proceedings against Empirics, &c., in every prince's reign from their first Incorporation to the Murther of the Royal Martyr, King Charles the First.’ These treatises are usually bound in one volume. The first gives an account of all the acts of parliament, royal charters, and judicial decisions establishing the privileges of the College of Physicians. The second, after an epistle dedicatory, which contains excellent brief biographies of the most distinguished fellows of the college of past times, gives details of all the prosecutions of empirics, or uneducated practisers of physic, extracted from the college records, and is of great historical interest. On 28 April 1691 Goodall succeeded Needham as physician to the Charterhouse, and for the rest of his life resided there with occasional visits to a house which he owned at Kensington. He enjoyed the friendship of Thomas Sydenham, of Sydenham's son, of Sir Hans Sloane, and of most of the physicians of his time. He was warmly attached to the College of Physicians, and the manuscript annals bear testimony to his constant attendance at its meetings. He presented the portraits of Henry VIII and of Thomas Wolsey which now hang in the censor's room. Sydenham dedicated his ‘Schedula Monitoria’ to Goodall, and speaks with respect of his medical skill and with warm admiration of his character. A letter from Goodall making an appointment to meet Sloane in consultation at the Three Tuns in Newgate Street, London, is in the British Museum (Sloane MS. 4046), and in the same volume are six other autograph letters of his, all written in a hand of beautiful clearness. One dated 1 September 1709 is from Leatherhead, the others from Charterhouse. On 26 October 1698 he asks to borrow some books, on 28 January 1697 he asks Sloane about two Arabian measures, ‘Zasang’ and ‘Rhoxates,’ and wishes to borrow ‘Agricola, de ponderibus.’ In another he proposes an edition of ‘Sydenham,’ and 9 January 1699 wishes to consult Sloane as to his own health. He married thrice, died at Kensington 23 August 1712, and is buried in the church of that parish. His widow gave his portrait to the College of Physicians in 1713. His combat as Stentor, champion of the College of Physicians, with a champion of the Apothecaries, is one of the incidents of the fifth canto of Garth's ‘Dispensary.’\nHis son, Charles Goddall, the younger, was a poet.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1890). \"Goodall, Charles\".

        "content": "The 2024 Bury Metropolitan Borough Council election is scheduled to be held on Thursday 2 May 2024, alongside the other local elections in the United Kingdom being held on the same day. One third of councillors - 17 out of 51 members - of Bury Metropolitan Borough Council are up for election. The Bury Independents Party intend to contest the election for the first time.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Local Government Act 1972 created a two-tier system of metropolitan counties and districts covering Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear, the West Midlands, and West Yorkshire starting in 1974. Bury was a district of the Greater Manchester metropolitan county. The Local Government Act 1985 abolished the metropolitan counties, with metropolitan districts taking on most of their powers as metropolitan boroughs. The Greater Manchester Combined Authority was created in 2011 and began electing the mayor of Greater Manchester from 2017, which was given strategic powers covering a region coterminous with the former Greater Manchester metropolitan county.\nSince its formation, Bury has variously been under Labour control, Conservative control and no overall control. Councillors have predominantly been elected from the Labour Party and the Conservative Party, with some Liberal Democrat and independent councillors also serving. The council has had an overall Labour majority since the 2011 election.\n\n\n== Electoral process ==\nThe council generally elects its councillors in thirds, with a third being up for election every year for three years, with no election in the fourth year. The election was conducted using the first-past-the-post voting system, with each ward electing one councillor.\nAll registered electors (British, Irish, Commonwealth and European Union citizens) living in Bury aged 18 or over were entitled to vote in the election. People who lived at two addresses in different councils, such as university students with different term-time and holiday addresses, were entitled to be registered for and vote in elections in both local authorities. Voting in-person at polling stations took place from 07:00 to 22:00 on election day, and voters were able to apply for postal votes or proxy votes in advance of the election.\n\n\n== Previous council composition ==\n\nChanges:\n\nFebruary 2024: James Mason resigns from Radcliffe First and sits as an independent.\nApril 2024: Bury Independents withdraw support from their Bury West candidate, Alan Bayfield, for social media conduct [1]\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nBury Metropolitan Borough Council elections",

        "content": "The Lalazar Bridge (Azerbaijani: Laləzar körpüsü) is a historic architectural monument in the Əliquluuşağı, Qubadli District of Azerbaijan.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe construction of Lalazar Bridge was completed in about 1867. However, some sources say that the bridge was built earlier, in the 18th century. The monument built on the Bargushad river has one arch, the lower part is oval, and the upper part is flat. Like many historical bridges in Azerbaijan, natural rocks were used for support. The width of the Lalazar Bridge is 2.8 meters, the height above the water surface is 4.5 meters. According to the old elders living in the first half of the 20th century talking about the construction of the bridge, Khoja Simon, the father of a person named Lalazar, bought a garden plot at a high price from a gentleman from the village of Əliquluuşağı at the beginning of the century. After the sale of the garden area of 2000 m from the village, together with that garden, a large area of more than 1000 ha is transferred to the hands of Armenians. The son of Khoja Simon (in Ahliman Akhundov's book \"The Fugitive Nabi\", the scene of Nabi taking Khoja's varidat and distributing it to the poor can be found) Lalazar built the bridge in the 19th century. The goal was to bring the Armenian villages of Zangezur, living in hunger and poverty, to the forests of Azerbaijan. In the middle of the last century, Armenians used to transport loads of firewood, coal and forest materials from the mountain slopes of Khndzoresk, Digh (Tex) and other Armenian villages along the road called \"Armenian road\" among the people.\n\n\n== See also ==\nArchitecture of Azerbaijan\n\n\n== References ==",

It is located in the southern part of the Puy-de-Dôme department in the municipality of Anzat-le-Luguet and rises to an altitude of 1,547 meters. It takes its name from Luguet, a village situated on its northeastern slope.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe Signal du Luguet corresponds to ancient lava lakes formed 5 million years ago. Erosion has erased the reliefs that once overlooked them, leaving the rock in its current elevated position.\nBelow, to the east, lies the Artout cirque. It is one of the most beautiful glacial valleys in the Massif Central. 20,000 years ago, snow swept by west winds accumulated to the east. It formed a glacier due to the limited exposure to the sun. Moraines can still be found on the slopes.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

During the journey, a tropical storm caused the ship, the Sea Venture to be run aground on the uninhabited St. George's Island, Bermuda with George Somers, Thomas Gates, William Strachey, Silvester Jourdain and other settlers marooned.\nRobert Rich wrote a \"verse pamphlet\", \"Newes from Virginia: the lost flocke triumphant.\" Along with the writings of William Strachey and Silvester Jourdain, became well known in England in 1610, when Thomas Gates and Christopher Newport retold the saga in London. In 1865 this work was rediscovered in a Viscount Charlemont library in Ireland by Shakespeare researcher John O. Halliwell. Halliwell printed a small amount of copies for distribution.\nRaised with a strong pious outlook, he and his brother (Nathaniel Rich, board member of the Somers Isles Company) were allies to the Puritans and to his cousin, Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick.\nRobert Rich returned to Bermuda in 1616 or 1617, and died there in 1630.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRich family\nGrandfather Richard Rich, 1st Baron Rich\nUncle Robert Rich, 1st Earl of Warwick\nCousin Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick\nBrother Nathaniel Rich (merchant adventurer)\nNephew Nathaniel Rich (soldier)\nTrue Reportory\n\n\n== Notes ==\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\nAttributions\n\nChisholm, Hugh, ed.

He is a 2-time IPF World Champion and 6-time National champion.\n\n\n== Powerlifting career ==\nOrhii competed in his first powerlifting competition in 2015, and competed in bodybuilding in 2016.\nIn 2018, Orhii qualified for the IPF World Classic Powerlifting Championships, and competed in the open as a junior (23-years-old). He would squat an open world record of 298.5 kilograms, which would shortly be surpassed by Brett Gibbs. Orhii would secure second place at the competition.\nIn 2019, Orhii qualified a second time, where he became IPF World Champion in the 83 kilogram weight class. He would also break the world record squat with 313 kilograms and a world record 833 kilogram total.\nIn 2021, the IPF suspended and later expelled USA Powerlifting for non-compliance with their anti-doping code. American athletes were ineligible to compete at the 2021 IPF World Championships. Orhii was eligible to compete but represented the United States Virgin Islands. Orhii would win the IPF World Championships for a third time, and would break his own squat world record, the deadlift world record and break his own total world record.\nIn 2022, Orhii would withdraw from competing in the IPF in favor of USA Powerlifting. Competing in the 82.5 kilogram weight class, Orhii competed at the 2022 USA Powerlifting Mega Nationals, where he would secure first place, and would break the squat and total American Record.\nIn 2023, Orhii withdrew from the USA Powerlifting nationals to compete in the IPF again. IPF rules disallow athletes who compete outside an IPF-affilited meet for 6 months, which forced Orhii to withdraw from USA Powerlifting Nationals to compete in Powerlifting America Nationals, a qualification meet for IPF Worlds. At the 2024 Powerlifting America nationals, Orhii unofficially broke three IPF world records and secured first place.\n\n\n=== Business ===\nOrhii is the founder of Corrupted Strength, a powerlifting gym in Stafford, Texas, which opened in 2021. Before its' opening, Orhii ran a powerlifting mock meet in the gym. The gym would close in 2023 due to Orhii's landlord refusing to renew the lease.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOrhii is of Nigerian descent. He was born in San Antonio, Texas, and shortly moved to Houston where he grew up around the area. He is the son of Nigerian politician Paul Orhii.\n\n\n== Personal records ==\n\n\n=== Competition bests ===\nSquat – 340 kg (749.8 lbs)\nBench Press – 195 kg (429.9 lbs)\nDeadlift – 350 kg (771.6 lbs)\nTotal – 885 kg (1,951.1 lbs)\n\n\n=== Record lifts in competition ===\nSquat – 301 kg (663.6 lbs) – USA Powerlifting Junior American Record (83 kg) – 10/11/2018\nSquat – 323 kg (712.1 lbs) – USA Powerlifting Open American Record (83 kg) – 6/14/2021\nTotal – 843 kg (1,858.5 lbs) – USA Powerlifting Open American Record (83 kg) – 6/14/2021\nSquat – 320 kg (705.8 lbs) – IPF Open Classic World Record (83 kg) – 9/30/2021\nDeadlift – 333 kg (734.1 lbs) – IPF Open Classic World Record (83 kg) – 9/30/2021\nTotal – 841 kg (1,854.1 lbs) – IPF Open Classic World Record (83 kg) – 9/30/2021\nSquat – 320.5 kg (706.6 lbs) – USA Powerlifting Open American Record (82.5 kg) – 6/8/2022\nTotal – 838 kg (1,847.5 lbs) – USA Powerlifting Open American Record (82.5 kg) – 6/8/2022\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External use ==\nRussel Orhii's profile on YouTube.\nRussel Orhii's profile on TikTok.\nRussel Orhii's profile on Instagram.\nRussel Orhii's profile on X / Twitter.",

He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated B. A. in 1573, and was elected a fellow. In 1577 he took the degree of M.A., and on 30 August 1603 was incorporated M.D. at Oxford. He was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians on 13 May 1608. He was physician to James I and to Henry, prince of Wales, whom he attended in his last illness in 1612. His signature is attached to the original record of the post-mortem examination of the prince preserved in the Record Office, London. His only published work is an address to Dr. Matthew Gwinne in Greek verse, prefixed to Gwinne's 'Vertumnus,' 1607. He died in 1617. His youngest son, Henry Hammond, was the famous divine; an elder son, Robert, was father of Colonel Robert Hammond.\n\n\n== References ==\nSpecific\n\nGeneral\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1890). \"Hammond, John (1551-1617)\".

        "content": "Cesar J. Kaskel (1833 – ?) was a Prussian-born Southern Unionist during the American Civil War.\nKaskel was a staunch supporter of the Union, serving as vice-president of the unionist Paducah Union League Club. Despite his outspoken loyalty to the United States, Kaskel and thirty Jewish families were forcibly expelled from Paducah, Kentucky in 1862 under General Order No. 11.\nDeported from Paducah, Kaskel embarked on a press campaign against the order. Described as a \"Paul Revere-like ride to Washington\" by historian Jonathan Sarna, the deportation was widely condemned. Kaskel successfully met with President Abraham Lincoln to protest the order, which Lincoln reprimanded on January 4, 1863.\n\n\n== Civil War ==\n\n\n=== Arriving in Kentucky ===\nKaskel immigrated to Paducah, Kentucky, in 1858. Kaskel opened a business in partnership with one Solomon Greenbaum, which struggled due to the Union blockade of Southern industry throughout the war. Despite his floundering business, Kaskel sided with the Union, and his brother Julius served in the Union Army.\n\n\n=== General Order No. 11 ===\nEnraged by wartime cotton smuggling, Major-General Ulysses S. Grant scapegoated Jewish merchants for the cotton black market. Grant ordered the mass deportation of Jews on December 17, 1862, from the Department of Tennessee, which included Paducah.\nCaptain L. J. Waddell sent Kaskel personal notice of Grant's orders and demanded Kaskel leave the city.\n\nOFFICE OF PROVOST MARSHAL\nPaducah, Ky., December 28, 1862\nC.J. Kaskel— Sir: In pursuance of General Order No 11, issued from General Grant's headquarters, you are hereby ordered to leave the city of Paducah, Kentucky, within twenty-four hours after receiving this order.\nBy order,\nL.J. WADDELL,\n\nCaptain and Provost Marshal\n\n\n=== Meeting with Lincoln ===\nKaskel fled Kentucky on the steamship Charley Bowen, making stops in Cairo, Illinois and Cincinnati, Ohio, while his story was picked up by the Associated Press. With support from the local Jewish community, Kaskel met with Ohio congressman John A. Gurley, who took Kaskel to meet with President Lincoln.\nAfter their meeting, Lincoln ordered General-in-Chief of the Armies Henry Halleck to reprimand the order. Halleck wrote to Grant, \"If such an order has been issued, it will be immediately revoked.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Public School 116, the Mary Lindley Murray School, is a public school administered by the New York City Department of Education on the   of Manhattan, near the border between the Murray Hill and Kips Bay neighborhoods.  An elementary school, it serves pupils in pre-kindergarten through fifth grade.\nThe school building is located on East 33rd Street between Second and Third Avenues, although the school yard extends through the block to East 32nd Street.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first school building on the site was erected on East 32nd Street, where the present school yard is located, in 1868. The 1857–62 Perris, W., Maps of the city of New York show the approximate location of the present school yard as a cleared site while the rest of the block is filled with typical townhouses. The 1879 Bromley, G.W. Atlas of the entire city of New York shows the site of the school yard with a building labeled 'Primary School No. 16.' In 1897, the former \"Primary\" schools in the city were renumbered and given \"Public School\" numbers that were 100 greater than their former Primary School numbers, which meant that Primary School No. 16 became Public School No. 116. The current main school building was built in 1924, when the building on 33rd Street was demolished and replaced by the school yard. A three-story wing was added to the east of the building in 1960.The school has long cultivated a diverse community. The New York Times reported in 1964 that of the school's 635 students, \"Half are Spanish‐speaking, 5 per cent are Negro, 5 per cent are Chinese,\" and that the school community hoped to maintain its diversity among urban renewal. In 1992 it was reported that students hailed \"from 50 countries\" and that \"30 arrived from Romania\" in the last year.PS 116 had one of the first gifted and talented programs in New York, beginning with a pilot program in 1973. The gifted and talented program at PS 116 was phased out in 2012.The school suffered from overcrowding, operating at 120% of capacity in 2011, prior to the opening of the River School, which reduced the size of its attendance zone.\n\n\n== Notable alumni ==\nAlicia Keys\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to P.S. 116 (Manhattan) at Wikimedia Commons",

A sequel to both The Boondock Saints (1999) and The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day (2009), this film will see Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus reprise their roles from the first two films as well as serving as executive producers, but Troy Duffy will not return to direct this film; instead he will be continuing their story in a series of books. This film is also branded as a \"reimagining\" of the franchise, as Thunder Road Films joins Impossible Dream Entertainment and rights holder Dragonfly Films as a production company on the film.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\n\n== Cast ==\nSean Patrick Flanery as Connor MacManus, one half of the MacManus twins.\nNorman Reedus as Murphy MacManus, the other half of the MacManus twins.\n\n\n== Production ==\nDirector Troy Duffy spoke about a potential sequel in an interview on June 13, 2011. He said that \"We’ve been approached to do a possible Boondock Saints TV series. So the fans may be getting a part 3 as a television show. We might be able to pull that off….I actually called both Sean and Norman and they both said “hell yeah, we’ll drop everything.” On March 21, 2012, it was indicated by Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus that Boondock Saints 3 is being written, tentatively titled \"The Boondock Saints III: Saints Preserve Us.\" However, on September 14, Norman Reedus stated that there would be no third film.\nAgain, on February 26, 2013, Troy Duffy stated that he was getting together with Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flanery to resume talks about Boondock Saints 3, in hopes that they could make the film a reality for fans. Later in 2013 at the Calgary Comic & Entertainment Expo, Sean Patrick Flanery confirmed that The Boondock Saints 3 is being worked on by Troy Duffy by saying \"After the recent tragedies hit Boston I texted (director) Troy Duffy to ask him about when he would work on the third one and he replied ‘on it’\". On July 16, 2013, Troy Duffy stated in an interview with CraveOnline that he was halfway finished with the script for The Boondock Saints III.\nOn May 6, 2017, Sean Patrick Flannery announced on Twitter that he and Norman Reedus had walked away from production of Boondock Saints III with no further explanation, leading the future of the series in doubt.\nIn November 2021, a third Boondock Saints film was officially announced, with Reedus and Flanery reprising their roles as Connor and Murphy MacManus and Duffy returning to direct. Production was slated to begin in May 2022.\nIn March 2024, a \"reimagining\" of the franchise was officially announced, with Thunder Road Films joining Impossible Dream Entertainment and rights holder Dragonfly Films as a production company on the film. Reedus and Flanery will reprise their roles and serve as executive producers, although Duffy, who plans to continue the story through a series of books, will not return as director.\n\n\n== Marketing & Release ==\n\n\n== Home Media ==\n\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Udayak, also known as Project UDAYAK is a project of the Border Roads Organisation under the Ministry of Defence of India. It was established on 1 June 1990 by separating two task forces from Project Vartak and Project Sewak. The project was tasked with taking on road and other construction work in the eastern districts of Arunachal Pradesh. The project mainly focuses on the construction and development of India–China Border Roads and inter-valley connectivity in eastern Aruanchal Pradesh. The project plays a vital role in the Arunachal Pradesh package of the SARDP-NE project and the Bharatmala project. Apart from these, the project also contributes in the social development of the people in the region.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the 1980s, Project Vartak consisted of five Border Roads Task forces (BRTF) while Project Sewak had 4 BRTFs. To improve command and control of the units, a new project was sanctioned by the government on 23 May 1989 after which Udayak was established on 1 June 1990. The headquarters was chosen to be Doomdooma in the Tinsukia district of Assam. The project was established in a period of heightened civil unrest and insurgency in North-east India. The 48 BRTF was stationed in Kimin while 752 BRTF was stationed in Kohima before their induction in Project Udayak. Colonel P.K. Chowdhury was appointed as the first chief engineer of the project.\n\n\n== Command Structure ==\n\nThe project is mainly divided into 48th task force currently stationed near Tezu in Lohit district and the 752nd task force in Roing, Lower Dibang Valley district. Both of these task forces include numerous companies which in turn include platoons and detachments. The task forces are headed by a commander while the companies are headed by an officer commanding.\n\n\n== Works and involvements ==\nUdayak maintains more than 2,100 kilometres (1,300 mi) of roads and numerous bridge infrastructure across the tough terrain of Eastern Arunachal Pradesh and some parts of Assam and Nagaland which include national highways, general staff roads which are in line with defence requirements and India-China border roads. The 48 BRTF undertakes road and bridge infrastructure works in the Lohit, Namsai, Anjaw and part of Lower Dibang districts of Arunachal Pradesh while the 752 BRTF undertakes works in Lower Dibang Valley, Dibang Valley district, Tirap and Changlang. Many of its units are air maintained by the Army Aviation Corps and Indian Air Force due to difficult terrain.\nThe project has played a major role in the development of the National Highway 15 and Dibrugarh Airport. It has also constructed buildings for Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya in Tissa of Longding district of Arunachal Pradesh and Chare of Tuensang district of Nagaland.\nIn 2010, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India found financial misappropriations and wasteful expenses in the proceedings of the project which was later notified to the Ministry of Defence.\nThe project also inaugurated the 720 metres (0.45 mi) Digaru bridge in the year 2012 connecting the Lohit district to the Lower Dibang valley district of Arunachal Pradesh which facilitates easy movement of locals as well as troops in the region.\nIn April 2018, a bridge collapsed in the Hayuliang-Changwanti road due to heavy rainfall cutting off numerous villages including the border town of Kibithu. Restoration work was initiated in collaboration with the National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited. Later in September the same year, a new steel bridge was constructed in the route by the project.\nIn 2019, former defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman inaugurated the Diffo bridge over the Diffo river on the Roing – Koronu- Paya road improving connectivity between the Dibang valley and Lohit valley region of Eastern Arunachal Pradesh. Former Director general of Border Roads Organisation Lieutenant Harpal Singh said that the bridge was built under tough conditions like flash floods where numerous workers lost their lives.\nIn 2020, the project completed the 65 metres (0.040 mi) long bridge over the Kramti river on the Changwanti-Walong-Namti route located 25 kilometres (16 mi) from Hawai.\nIn 2021, Udayak conducted a free health camp in the Choephelling Tibetan Settlement located in the Changlang district of Arunachal Pradesh, which is administered by the Central Tibetan Administration. The former Chief Engineer of Udayak, Vimal Goswami, promised the settlement office that the health camp would continue every week until a new medical facility is established.\nUnder an 'exhibition of best practices' organised by the Ministry of Defence, the project in 2022 resurfaced 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) of the Roing-Koronu-Paya road with shredded plastic in the asphalt concrete road construction process.\nIn May 2023, the project established connectivity to the village of Tapatuwi on the Chaglohagam-Rocham Road. The project already had an air-maintained unit in the village since 2019. The hard rocky strata prevented from establishing road connectivity. The task encountered resistance from the locals and the Arunachal Pradesh Youth Congress (APYC) in 2020 due to non-receipt of land compensation payments and alleged errors in land acquisition. It was later found that the project had sanctioned a payment of INR 24 crores but corruption was seen in the compensation disbursement process by local officials of the Government of Arunachal Pradesh.\nIn August 2023, the project inaugurated a bailey bridge over the 'Tha Nala' located 24 kilometres (15 mi) from Chaglohagam. The 'Tha Nala' was regularly affected by floods after rain which caused issues in the smooth movement of locals and troops through the area. The local mishmi population appreciated the efforts by the project.\n\n\n== See also ==\nProject Shivalik\nProject Dantak\nProject Himank\n\n\n== References ==",

He migrated to Peterhouse, and there became M.A. in 1583. He received a license to practise in London from the Royal College of Physicians 9 April 1593, and was elected a fellow in February 1597. He was nine times censor between 1599 and 1619, was treasurer from 1621 to 1624, and president in 1620. On 5 November 1612 he attended with Dr. John Giffard at the bedside of Henry, prince of Wales. Several long consultations were held with Sir Theodore Mayernem Dr. John Hammond, Dr. Henry Atkins and Dr. William Butler, and in the presence of Sir Thomas Challoner and Sir David Murray in October 1612, and the result was that, on the opinion of the majority, a prescription known as diascordium was given to the prince, with no good effect, for he died next day. Palmer was present at the post-mortem examination, and in the original report his signature stands fourth of the six physicians. In the report, as printed by Mayerne, his name is last. He died early in 1625.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1895). \"Palmer, Richard (d.1625)\". In Lee, Sidney (ed.).

        "content": "Robert Anton Winterberg (27 February 1884 – 22 June 1930) was an Austrian composer, conductor, pianist, and theatre director. He is best known as a composer of German-language operettas, most of which he created during the 1910s and 1920s. Two of his operettas were adapted into English for Broadway: Die Dame in Rot (1911, Vienna) as The Lady in Red (1919, Lyric Theatre) and Die schöne Schwedin (1915, Vienna) as The Girl from Brazil (1916, 44th Street Theatre). His most successful operettas in Europe were Die Dame vom Zirkus (1919) and Günstling der Zarin (1921).\n\n\n== Life and career ==\n\nBorn into a Jewish family in Vienna on 27 February 1884, Robert Winterberg was the son of journalist Friedrich W. Winterberg (1835–1908) who was the founder of the Viennese newspaper Wiener Kommunalblatt. His mother was Pauline Schönfeld. At the age of 14, he chose to cease practicing his Jewish religion.\nWinterberg studied music privately with Gustav Mahler, Robert Fuchs, and Hermann Graedener. At the age of 15, he produced his first music compositions which included a piano sonata, a string quartet, and several art songs. A few years later, the first public concert of his music was given at Ehrbar Saal (English: Ehrbar Hall) inside the Palais Ehrbar by baritone Joseph Schwartz and soprano Olga von Türk-Rohn with Winterberg as pianist. In 1906, Türk-Rohn and Winterberg were invited to Peleș Castle in Sinaia by Elisabeth of Romania where they gave a concert of Winterberg's music for the queen.\nWinterberg's first experience writing music for the stage was for a new staging of Paul Wertheimer's play Die Frau des Rajah (1906) at the Volkstheater in 1909 for which he wrote incidental music. In 1910, he married the actress and singer Margarete Isbary. That same year, his first operetta, Fasching in Paris, was staged in Vienna. This was followed by two more operettas written for Viennese theatres: Ihr Adjutant (1911, Theater an der Wien) and Madame Serafin (1911, premiered at the Neuen Operntheater, Hamburg but was a co-production with the Johann Strauss Theater in Vienna).\nWinterberg's early operettas in Vienna were not particularly successful, and he relocated to Berlin in hopes of achieving better success in that city.  There, he had his first major success as a composer with the operetta Die Dame in Rot at the Theater des Westens in 1911. Well received, the work enjoyed popularity both in Germany and abroad. American playwright Anne Caldwell adapted it into an English language version for Broadway entitled The Lady in Red which starred Adele Rowland. It was performed at the Lyric Theatre in 1919 prior to going on a national tour.\nDie Dame in Rot was the second of Winterberg's operettas to reach the Broadway stage.  His 1915 operetta Die schöne Schwedin (English: The Beautiful Swede) premiered at the Theater an der Wien and was his first operetta to gain popular appeal in Vienna. It was adapted by Sigmund Romberg, Edgar Smith, and Matthew C. Woodward into The Girl from Brazil. This modified version of Winterberg's operetta premiered at Broadway's 44th Street Theatre on 30 August 1916 and enjoyed a New York run of 61 performances before going on tour.\nWinterberg's greatest success as an operetta composer among European audiences was Die Dame vom Zirkus (1919) and Günstling der Zarin (1921). His operettas were staged in cities in Germany, Austria, Latvia, and Czechoslovakia during his lifetime, sometimes with Winterberg conducting or staging the performances.\nIn 1925, Winterberg married his second wife, Hedwig Russak, in Berlin. He died of a lung infection in Töpchin on 22 June 1930.\n\n\n== Partial list of operettas ==\n\nFasching in Paris (1910), librettists Benno Vigny and Louis Windhopp\nIhr Adjutant (1911), librettists Franz von Schoenthan and Rudolf Öesterreicher\nMadame Serafin (1911), librettists Georg Okonkowski and Bruno Granichstaedten\nDie Dame in Rot (1911), librettists Julius Brammer and Alfred Grünwald\nDie Frauen von Monte Carlo (1912), librettist Alfred Deutsch-German\nHoheit – der Franz!

        "content": "Campaigns of the Zaporozhian Cossacks — was campaigns of the Zaporozhian Cossacks on land routes, mainly against the Poles, but also sometimes against the Turks and Tatars.\nThe Zaporozhian Cossacks, as a social class, were a powerful opposition force capable of fighting not only against the current system, but also against Polish rule and Turkish-Tatar raids.\n\n\n== Causes ==\nIn the late 16th century, Ukrainian lands were in a difficult situation. The expansion of Poland led to the loss of the remnants of Ukrainian statehood. The constant threat of attacks from Ottoman Empire and the Crimean Khanate encouraged the struggle. It was at this time that the Cossacks emerged as a leading stratum of Ukrainian society. The Cossacks' military skills increased, which facilitated military campaigns.\n\n\n== Organisation of campaigns ==\nThe campaigns were organised mainly in the spring. This was due to the appearance of green vegetation, which provided a natural camouflage effect. It was in the spring that the number of Cossacks increased, using newcomers and fugitives from all over Ukraine. The organisation of the campaign began with the saluting of the cannons located in the Sich. Further actions included sending envoys to all parts of the Zaporozhian liberties.\nBy their nature, the campaigns can be classified as defensive and offensive. In the case of the former, the Cossacks gathered very quickly to repel an attack and seize the spoils. In the case of the offensive campaign, which was planned as a large-scale military campaign, the Zaporozhian Cossacks used the help of Cossacks from Ukraine. The Zaporozhian officers sent envoys to Ukrainian cities to recruit as many people as possible to participate in the campaign. Recruiters did this mainly at bazaars and fairs. They would climb onto carts and shout loudly:\n\"Whoever wants to be put on a stake, whoever wants to be quartered, drawn and quartered, whoever is ready to suffer all kinds of torment for the Holy Cross, whoever is not afraid of death - join us!. This campaigning work yielded positive results. Subsequently, organisational actions were transferred to the Zaporozhian Sich, where the foreman convened a Cossack council that determined the specifics of planning the campaign itself. After that, the Cossacks dispersed to kurens, slobodas, and winter quarters to provide weapons, food, and prepare carts and horses. If all the organisational aspects were completed, the Cossacks would proceed to the campaign.\n\n\n== Preparation ==\nThe Cossack army was divided into infantry, cavalry and artillery. The Cossack infantry was known for its skill in Europe. This type of army was lined up in three ranks. The first one fired, the second one served, and the third one loaded the guns.  Infantry was more numerous than cavalry. During campaigns, the cavalry formed a semicircle, the so-called \"lava\", which allowed them to attack the enemy not only along the front line but also from the flanks.  The Cossacks' weapons were sabers, spears, muskets, pistols, rifles, war hammers, anchors, and hornets. When loading firearms, the Cossacks were covered by archers.  The bow shot much faster than the rifle of the time.\nAll the firearms and cold steel used by the Cossacks were partly their own and partly made by others. Cold weapons were most often made in the Sich... The Cossacks also had a lot of mobile guns.\nEvery Cossack had an axe, a shovel, a scythe, and ropes. This equipment was used during the construction of fortifications. They transported this equipment, as well as food, ammunition, forage, and the wounded on carts. Guns were carried on separate carts. Blacksmiths, cooks, locksmiths, i.e. all those who had to provide for the needs of the army, were preparing for the campaign. For orientation on the terrain, they used the Nuremberg square, which was a substitute for a compass.\n\n\n== Tactics ==\nThe Cossack army had its own marching order, which met all the norms of the military system of the time. A Standard-bearer with a Cossack flag was in the lead. Behind him was the kish otaman. In the Sich, the otaman remained in charge during the campaign. The Cossack reconnaissance detachment moved first. The cavalry followed. The main forces followed the advanced detachment at a distance of 11-15 kilometres. Watch patrols were sent in all directions from the camp. The tactical reconnaissance was to meet or overtake the enemy, using the way of reconnaissance by combat, to stop him or delay him until the main forces arrived. Such tactical reconnaissance was used by Bohdan Khmelnytsky in the battles of Zhovti Vody and near Korsun (1648). During the campaign, the Cossacks tried to remain unnoticed as long as possible. It was forbidden for the Cossacks to light fires or smoke pipes. They were allowed to speak in a half-whisper. Horses' muzzles were wrapped with belts, ropes, and scarves. The cavalry was in the centre of the battle formation, lined up in three or four lines. Infantry was placed on the flanks. Light guns were placed between individual infantry units.\nAs for the way of warfare on land, the Cossacks are better infantrymen than cavalrymen; they are hardy and tireless, obey their leaders with extraordinary skill in earthworks and fortifications, not only with the help of shanties but also with carts on the march. They are so strong behind these mobile fortifications, which are essential in the desolate steppes where the Tatars come up every now and then, that a thousand Cossacks, protected in this way, resist thousands of infidels who do not dismount at all and are delayed by any ditch or slightest obstacle...\nThe Cossacks often used the camp tactic during their overland campaigns. It was used both for the advancement of troops and for offensive or defensive purposes. It was shaped like a rectangle. The camp was made up of several rows of carts fastened with iron chains wheel to wheel. The spikes were raised upwards. Inside, a fortified space was formed between the carts, which looked like an impregnable fortress. Cannons were placed in the corners, so the infantry was fully fortified. Sometimes the Cossacks made ditches, ramparts, and wolf pits around the camp. It was thanks to the well-regulated tactics that the Cossacks' campaigns ended in victory.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nMytsyk Y. A. et al.

The song was written by Erik Anderson, Michael Spragg, and Danick Dupelle, while Scott Cooke produced the track. It is the title track and third single off Hyatt's 2020 extended play Neverland.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAlthough Hyatt did not write the song, he felt an attachment to it upon hearing it. He described \"the idea of 'Neverland'\" as \"something that seems unattainable\". Hyatt felt a personal connection, once being told by a guidance counsellor in high school that being a musician was \"not a real job\". To him, the idea of \"Neverland\" represents the \"journey of taking everybody's no's and proving them wrong\" and the song connected with him through the sense of \"reaching that seemingly unattainable goal\".\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nJoshua Murray and Trish Cassling of The Reviews Are In spoke favourably of the song, stating that when Hyatt \"starts laying out his feelings it never feels like he’s pandering or trying too hard\", adding that on \"Neverland\" it \"hits hard in the heart\".\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe official music video for \"Neverland\" premiered on September 18, 2020.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Juday ibn Ali al-Kirmani al-Ma'ni (Arabic: جديع بن علي الكرماني المعني; fl. 736–747) was an Azdi commander in Khurasan during the final decades of the Umayyad Caliphate. He initially helped defeat the rebel al-Harith ibn Surayj and his Türgesh allies in 736–737, becoming one of the most prominent men in Khurasan and a rival to the Umayyad governor, Nasr ibn Sayyar. The rivalry led in 744 to a revolt of the Yamani tribes against Nasr, in which al-Kirmani was joined by his former enemy, Ibn Surayj. The two allies expelled Nasr from the provincial capital, Merv, in late 746 but soon fell out, and both Ibn Surayj and later al-Kirmani were killed. The turmoil of the revolt opened the way for the start and eventual triumph of the Abbasid Revolution.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\n\nAs his nisba shows, Juday al-Kirmani was born and raised at Jiruft in Kirman. His family belonged to the Azd 'Uman, and was closely allied to the Muhallabid clan, which was prominent in the Islamic East; Juday's father had fought under al-Muhallab ibn Abi Sufra in Kirman.\nJuday first appears in 736, during the suppression of the revolt of al-Harith ibn Surayj by the governor of Khurasan, Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri. With a contingent of 6,000 men, al-Kirmani blockaded the fortress of Tabushkhan, in Upper Tokharistan, where many of Ibn Surayj's supporters, including some of his relatives and his army's baggage train, had taken refuge. After the fortress surrendered, according to the 10th-century historian al-Tabari, 400 of the men were executed, and the other defenders, including women and children, were sold into slavery at Balkh. Defeated, Ibn Surayj and the remnants of his followers fled across the Oxus River and found refuge with the Türgesh Khaganate. In the next year, the Türgesh heavily defeated an Arab army across the Oxus, and in turn invaded Khurasan, joined by Ibn Surayj and his men. During the subsequent campaign, Juday was named Asad's deputy and left in charge of the defence of Balkh, which at the time was Khurasan's capital and the main base for the Arab military operations against the Türgesh. The Türgesh invasion was turned back at the Battle of Kharistan in December 737, where the Türgesh khagan was routed and in turn forced to flee across the Oxus, accompanied by Ibn Surayj. The widely dispersed Türgesh detachments sent to raid south of the Oxus were largely destroyed piecemeal by al-Kirmani, ending the threat to Khurasan.\nHis successes under Asad rendered al-Kirmani the most prominent man in Khurasan, according to the judgment of his contemporaries. Al-Tabari reports that when Asad died in 738, Juday was appointed governor of Khurasan by the governor of Iraq, Yusuf ibn Umar al-Thaqafi. However, Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 724–743) distrusted the Yaman (southern Arab tribes), to whom al-Kirmani's own Azd tribe belonged; and with the exception of Asad himself, since the downfall of the Muhallabids in 717, Khurasan had been ruled by governors from the northern Arab tribes (Qays or Mudar), who favoured their own kin and humiliated the southerners. Junayd was thus not confirmed in office, but replaced by Nasr ibn Sayyar, a veteran soldier from Khurasan whose own tribe was fairly unimportant, and thus deprived him of any independent power base. As a result, Nasr's rule throughout his tenure was not fully accepted by many Arab tribesmen and especially the Yaman, who still favoured al-Kirmani; Nasr's position was thus heavily reliant on firm backing from the Umayyad imperial government in Damascus.\n\n\n=== Revolt ===\n\nThat support was undermined during the civil war of the Third Fitna, during which the Qays–Yaman rivalry broke out into open fighting; the eventual victor, Marwan II, was a champion of the northern Arab Qays. During the civil war, the security of Nasr's position fluctuated depending on the regime ruling in Damascus. Under the brief reign of the pro-Yaman Yazid III in 744, the Yaman in Khurasan hoped to see al-Kirmani appointed governor. Agitation among the Yaman persisted, amidst rumours that Nasr had intercepted letters appointing al-Kirmani as governor, and a dispute on the payment of stipends to the Khurasani Arab militia (muqatila). Nasr tried to secure his own position by deposing al-Kirmani from his leadership of the Azd, as well as by trying to win over Azd and Rabi'ah leaders. All this resulted in an uprising by the Azd and Rabi'ah under al-Kirmani, with the slogan \"revenge for the Muhallabids\", whose downfall at the hands of the Umayyads had become a symbol of Yamani resentment of the Umayyads and their northern Arab-dominated regime. \nOn 13 July 744, al-Kirmani was captured and imprisoned by Nasr, but he managed to escape after barely a month. The rebellion spread, with many of the Arab settlers around Merv joining it; although collectively called Yamaniyya in the sources, al-Kirmani's followers included most of the Syrian troops in the province as well as many northern Arab Mudar. A tentative truce was initially agreed upon, during which fruitless negotiations were conducted, but after Yazid reconfirmed Nasr in his post, al-Kirmani resumed his revolt. Nasr in turn tried to strengthen his own position by enlisting the services of al-Harith ibn Surayj, al-Kirmani's one-time adversary, who enjoyed considerable support among some Arab tribes and especially his own tribe, the northern Arab Tamim. When Ibn Surayj arrived at Merv in July 745, he was enthusiastically received by the town's inhabitants, scorned Nasr's proposals for cooperation, and soon rose in rebellion as well. In March 746 Ibn Surayj's army attacked Marv, but was repulsed with many casualties, and he then made common cause with al-Kirmani—of whose activities between his escape in 744 and this point nothing is known. With Marwan II still trying to consolidate his own position in Syria and Mesopotamia, Nasr was bereft of any hopes of reinforcement, and the allied armies of Ibn Surayj and al-Kirmani drove him out of Merv towards the end of 746.\nNasr retreated to Nishapur, but within days al-Kirmani and Ibn Surayj fell out among themselves and clashed, resulting in the death of Ibn Surayj. Al-Kirmani then destroyed the Tamimi quarters in Merv. This was a shocking act, as dwellings were traditionally considered exempt from warfare in Arab culture. As a result, the Mudari tribes, who hitherto had withheld their support from Nasr, now came over to him. With their backing, Nasr resolved to take back the capital. Nasr's and al-Kirmani's armies confronted each other before the walls of Marv, occupying two fortified camps and skirmishing with each other during June–September 747. The fighting stopped only when news came of the uprising of the Hashimiyya under Abu Muslim, which posed a threat to both. Negotiations commenced, but were almost broken off when a member of Nasr's entourage, an embittered son of Ibn Surayj, attacked and killed al-Kirmani.\nAl-Tabari claims that Nasr crucified al-Kirmani's body with a fish beside it, in a ritual humiliation of the Azd 'Uman, who originally were fishermen; but this tradition is considered unlikely by modern historians, as al-Kirmani's son and successor, Ali, quickly came to an agreement with Nasr. Nevertheless, both men remained wary of each other, and separately tried to win the backing of Abu Muslim, who now held the balance of power. The latter eventually chose to support al-Kirmani. On 14 February 748, the Hashimiyya army occupied Mwrv, and Nasr again had to flee the city. While the Hashimiyya forces were launched west in pursuit of Nasr, the fragile alliance between the Yaman under Ali al-Kirmani and Abu Muslim remained in place, and Ali's brother Uthman was even named governor of Balkh. After the defeat and death of Nasr in late 748, Abu Muslim felt himself strong enough to have both brothers and their most prominent followers killed. By the end of 750, the Hashimiyya forces had completed the Abbasid Revolution, overthrowing the Umayyad Caliphate and physically eliminating most of the Umayyad dynasty; in their place, the Abbasid Caliphate was established.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nBlankinship, Khalid Yahya, ed.

        "content": "Ali Fuat Başgil (1893–1967) was a Turkish politician and a faculty member of Istanbul University and Ankara University. He is one of the influential figures of the conservative political waves in Turkey. Following his dismissal from the university shortly after the military coup of 27 May 1960 he was elected as a senator. Then he became a candidate for the presidency of Turkey, but his nomination was rejected by the National Unity Committee. He joined the Justice Party and was elected as a member of the Parliament in the 1965 election. \n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHe was born in Çarşamba, Samsun, in 1893. After completing his primary school education in his hometown he went to Istanbul for secondary education. However, he could not graduate from high school since joined the Ottoman Army in 1914 and he fought on the Caucasian front for four years as a reserve officer.\nAfter the war he completed his secondary education at Buffone School in Paris, France. He obtained a degree in law from Grenoble University and then, received his master's degree with a thesis entitled Straits Issue from the University of Paris. He was also educated at the Paris School of Political Sciences and the Faculty of Letters. In addition, he graduated from The Hague Academy of International Law in 1929.\n\n\n== Career and activities ==\nFollowing his graduation he returned Turkey and joined the Ministry of Education. Next year he became an associate professor of law at Ankara University. He was promoted to the professorship of Roman law in 1931. He began to work at Istanbul University in 1933 when it was reorganized. In addition to the writing of the constitution of Hatay, he served as the legal advisor to the Turkish delegation in the League of Nations Commission in Geneva in regard to the independence of Hatay in 1937.\nBaşgil served as dean of the Faculty of Law, Istanbul University, between 1938 and 1942. He became an emeritus professor in 1939. For a short time, he taught fundamental organizational law at the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Political Science, Ankara University. In 1943, he returned to his chair at Istanbul University's Faculty of Law. He cofounded the Society for the Dissemination of Free Ideas in 1947.\nAfter the military coup of 27 May 1960 which ended the rule of the Democrat Party (DP), the National Unity Committee removed Başgil along with 147 faculty members from his academic post. Although they were later allowed by a special law to resume their academic posts, Başgil did not return to his teaching post retiring from the university on 10 April 1961. After his retirement Başgil became part of the Thinkers Club (Turkish: Aydınlar Kulübü) of which ideology was a synthesis of Turkism and Islamism. The other major members of the group included Arif Nihat Asya, Kemal Ilıcak, Tarık Buğra and Süleyman Yalçın.\nBaşgil was elected senator as an independent candidate from the Justice Party list representing Samsun in 1961. Although he ran for the presidency during this period, his nomination was rejected by the National Unity Committee. The Committee also asked his resignation from the Senate, and Başgil complied with this demand resigning from the senatorship. He went to Switzerland in 1962 where he worked at the Department of Turkish History and Language of the University of Geneva. Upon his return he joined the Justice Party and was elected as a member of parliament in the 1965 election.\n\n\n=== Work and views ===\nBaşgil published various books and articles written in Turkish and in other languages. He also contributed to various newspapers such as Zafer and magazines such as Serdengeçti. His articles were mostly about secularism and freedom of religion.\nThe views of Başgil have been employed by all center-right socio-political movements in Turkey. For instance, he was one of the major ideologues of the DP. Yalçın Akdoğan who developed the political identity of the Justice and Development Party as conservative democrat also used Başgil's concept of freedom of religion.\nBaşgil was the first Turkish scholar who discussed secularism openly and critically, but he did not reject it. He regarded secularism as the state's respect for the freedom of religion. For him secularism in Turkey did not function as the guarantor of the freedom of religion and conscience. Başgil's critics, on the other hand, argued that his formulation of secularism was based on Islam and also, a major deviation from the Turkish laicism. Başgil was also subject to the harsh criticisms by Nihal Atsız, a significant nationalist figure, due to his Anatolianist views.\nBaşgil considered religion or Islam to be both helpful and essential for individuals and society. He added that the state could not totally repress religious beliefs which may result in negative outcomes. In his later life he supported the Turkish–Islamic synthesis to bring together the conservative figures, including the Islamists and Turkists.\n\n\n== Death ==\nBaşgil died in Istanbul on 17 April 1967 and was buried in Karacaahmet Cemetery, Istanbul. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Roger Giffard (died 1597) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGiffard was the son of Ralph Giffard of Steeple Claydon, Buckinghamshire, by his wife Mary, daughter of Sir Edward Chamberlain of Woodstock, Oxfordshire. He was educated at Merton College, Oxford, of which house he became a fellow, and took the degree of B.A. on 14 August 1556, proceeding M.A. on 15 February 1559–60 (Reg. of Univ. of Oxford, Oxford Hist. Soc. i. 232, 238, 321). On 8 April 1562 he was elected junior university proctor, and was re-elected on 21 April 1563 (Wood, Fasti Oxon. ed. Bliss. i. 160, 162). As a bachelor of medicine of 23 June 1563, ‘sometime fellow of Merton College, now or lately fellow of All Souls' College,’ he was, on 30 August 1566, created M.D. by Drs. Walter and Henry Baylie by virtue of a commission directed to them by the convocation, which had selected him to dispute before Elizabeth on her intended visit to the university in the ensuing September (ib. i. 176). Giffard was afterwards appointed physician to the queen. He was censor of the Royal College of Physicians from 1570 to 1572, consiliarius from 1585 to 1587, and again in 1591, and president from 1581 to 1584. He died on 27 Jan. 1596–7, and was buried in the parish of St. Bride, Fleet Street. His will, made on the day of his death, was not proved until 1 August 1597 (registered in P. C. C. 77, Cobham). Therein he bequeathed to Lord-keeper Sir Thomas Egerton ‘the Jewell wherein the Quenes maties picture is which he vsed to weare aboutes his necke.’ He possessed lands in the county of Durham and a lease of the farm of Tollesbury in Essex. By his wife Frances, who survived him, he had a son Thomas, a daughter Mary, another daughter married to Thomas Harries, and probably other children. Giffard was a man of wide culture, well read in French, Italian, and Flemish literature. He requested his executors to deliver to Merton College ‘suche of his bookes as Mr. Henry Savill should choose to be placed in the Librarye of the same Colledge for the vse of the ffellowes and Schollers of the same howse.’\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Goodwin, Gordon (1890). \"Giffard, Roger\".

        "content": "The Rev. Edward Hugh Alington (9 April 1857 – 11 September 1938) was an English footballer and Church of England vicar, who played in the 1877 FA Cup final for Oxford University.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nAlington was the 8th son of John Alington of Candlesby, Lincolnshire.  He was educated at Westminster School, an early adopter of association laws.\n\n\n== Football career ==\nAlington featured for the school against the Gitanos in October 1872.  At this stage of his career he played as a forward, and received praise for his performance for the school against the Wanderers the following month.  He was considered a \"good dribbler\" but \"very slow\".\nPerhaps taking this constructive criticism on board, he retreated to half-back for the 1873–74 season (at a time when teams were playing formations akin to 2–2–6), and scored his first recorded goals for the school in a 2–1 win against the Civil Service in February 1874.\nIn 1875–76, he took over the captaincy of the school side, and was honoured by being chosen to play for the Wanderers in November; he played as a forward in a 7–0 win over Cricklewood.\nIn 1876, he went up to Hertford College, Oxford, gaining a second class in Honour Moderations in 1878 and took his Bachelor of Arts in 1880.  With such footballing experience, he quickly found a place in the university side, making his debut for the Dark Blues in a 1–0 win over the Wanderers in the Parks in November, playing up front.\nHe swapped between the university and the Wanderers almost randomly during the season.  On 13 December for instance he played for Wanderers against the university at the Kennington Oval, and the very next day for the university in the 1875–76 FA Cup against the 105th Regiment at the same venue.  While he was a forward for Wanderers, he played in goal for the university, and had an early lesson in the position when he was charged between the posts by a horde of soldiers in the Cup tie; it was the only goal he conceded as the university won 6–1.\nAlington played in goal in four Cup ties that season, culminating in the Cup Final, against the Wanderers, but he finished on the losing side.  He was however on the winning side in the Varsity Match in February 1877, keeping a clean sheet in Oxford's 1–0 win over Cambridge University.\nAlington continued playing in the 1877–78 season, switching between forward and goal, and scored in the Varsity match; this time however the Cantabs won 5–1.  He also scored a late equalizer in the 3–3 draw against the Royal Engineers in the 1877–78 FA Cup fourth round stage, but the defeat in the second replay was his last Cup tie, and, also, his last recorded association match.\n\n\n== Post-university ==\nAlington was ordained as a deacon in 1884, originally serving in Leicester, and he was based there when he married Margaret Maclaren in Summertown on 30 July 1885.  The couple lived afterwards in Summertown and had at least two sons - Geoffey Hugh (b. 7 December 1888) and John Marmaduke (b. 17 August 1890).\nHe later became headmaster of Summer Fields in Oxford, a post he held from 1918 to 1927.  He died at Bardwell Court, Oxford, on 11 September 1938.\n\n\n== References ==",

He left Iraq to work in the United Arab Emirates at a car garage. While living in the UAE, he left Islam and became a vocal critic of all religions. Wirya returned to Chamchamal in June 2023 to visit his family and friends.\n\n\n== Murder and arrest ==\nOn 22 June, around 5:30pm, Wirya was shot 10 times in a crowded market by a motorcyclist who fled the scene.\nHersh Karim, aged 28, was arrested and was very complaint during his interrogation and confessed to the murder. Karim was an active duty soldier in the Peshmerga, specifically the PUK wing. After Wirya's killing, Karim posted on his Facebook taking pride in his actions. He also had posted many pictures of Mullah Halo, a famous Kurdish Salafi cleric. Mullah Halo denied any involvement in the murder.\nWirya's killing went viral and brought up discussions about the growth of radical views  and Salafism among Kurds.\n\n\n== References ==",

Initially its works started in the city of Sofia in Bulgaria, where an Albanian comunity had formed early on. In 1921 it transfered the operations in Tirana, where it functioned until just after World War II. It was established by Kristo Luarasi.\nIt printed books from members of different Albanian colonies of the time, mainly from Bucharest, Istanbul and several cities in Egypt. The newspaper Drita, and a highly popular almanach called Kalendari Kombiar were both printed there. The press initially operated using the Istanbul alphabet, with types cut in Bucharest, before switching to the unified Albanian alphabet in 1908. It was nationalised in 1947 during communism in Albania.\n\n\n== See also ==\nKristo Luarasi\nMid'hat Frashëri\nShahin Kolonja\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Moderne Gallery is an American art and design gallery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania that focuses on art and furniture from the American Studio craft movement of the 20th century. Moderne Gallery maintains a large collection of ceramics, woodwork, woodturning, glass, and metalwork.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe gallery was founded in 1984 by Robert Aibel. Initially, Moderne was focused on French Art Deco work, but In 1985, the gallery pivoted to focusing on artwork and furniture from the Studio craft movement after selling a dining table and chair set created by George Nakashima. Shortly thereafter Moderne became the first gallery to start promoting Nakashima's work. Moderne Gallery is considered an instrumental organization in making George Nakashima a more recognizable artist of 20th century modern design.\nAlong with other art studios and local collectors, Moderne Gallery launched a pop-up exhibition and design showroom.  The exhibit was held in 2016 around the New Kensington arts district.\nIn 2022, Moderne Gallery was listed as one of the best furniture stores in Philadelphia by The Philadelphia Inquirer.\n\n\n== Location ==\nModerne Gallery had its studio in Old City, Philadelphia from 1984 to 2018. In 2019, Moderne Gallery moved to a 4,500 square foot gallery in Port Richmond, Philadelphia.\n\n\n== Artists ==\nModerne Gallery is considered a leading Nakashima dealer and has organized several exhibits for the artist. Moderne also showcases art and woodwork by Nakashima's daughter, Mira Nakashima.\nOther artists Moderne Gallery promotes:\n\nEric Allen\nJohn Eric Byers\nMiriam Carpenter\nArthur Espenet Carpenter\nWendell Castle\nJohn Conver Lutz\nZein Daouk\nFabien Dubrunfaut\nKarima Duchamp\nDavid Ebner\nWharton Esherick\nDavid Gilhooly\nEstelle Halper\nDan Jackson\nRiyoo Kim\nSam Maloof\nEmil Milan\nJere Osgood\nCaprice Pierucci\nJames Prestini\nBob Stocksdale\nTanaka Tomomi\nRyo Toyonaga\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 3R Landmark School Museum is located in a former two-story schoolhouse in Lonsdale, Minnesota. The museum run by the 3R Landmark Corporation opened in 1986 and features museum exhibits on local history while the second floor is preserved as an original classroom from when the building served as a public school for Independent School District #76 from 1908 to 1948. \n\n\n== History ==\nThe 3R Landmark Corporation which operates the museum was established on November 15, 1978. During that time, local resident Loretta Reece collaborated with 15 other Lonsdale women to explore the restoration of the two-story Lonsdale public schoolhouse. They created a model of the schoolhouse to showcase the envisioned restoration and initiated research on its history, specifically on Patrick Sullivan, the school's builder. Additionally, they began the application process to nominate the building to the National Register of Historic Places. By January 1979, the application was submitted to the Minnesota State Historic Preservation Office at the Minnesota Historical Society.\nIn April 1979, the newly formed 3R Landmark Corporation hosted a public meeting at the Lonsdale American Legion Hall to discuss potential uses for the school. Subsequently, in September 1979, the Lonsdale Public Schoolhouse was officially listed in the National Register of Historic Places.\nFollowing this recognition, the Lonsdale City Council approved a 99-year lease to the 3R Landmark Corporation, leading to groundbreaking ceremonies on April 22, 1980, and construction commencing in September. By November, foundational work, utility connections, and ground grading were successfully completed. As membership has aged the City of Lonsdale has taken over maintenance of the building with the organization seeking out new members. \n\n\n== Lonsdale Public School ==\nThe Lonsdale Public School building, a two-story public schoolhouse was built in 1908 by local carpenter Patrick Sullivan, and holds significance for its architecture and connection to education in Lonsdale. Believed to be designed by Sullivan, the school's rectangular shape and vertical emphasis draw from late nineteenth-century plan book schools. Its decoration, including the cupola, reflects early American public buildings like Sir Christopher Wren's William and Mary College. The school served as a central hub for many years in Lonsdale's educational landscape until 1948.\n\n\n== Building Description ==\nThe Lonsdale Public School is situated atop one of Lonsdale's highest rolling hills. The two-story frame building, resting on a cut limestone foundation, spans 26 feet in width and 40 feet in depth. Standing at 24 feet from foundation to eave line, it features an octagonal cupola at the center of the tin hipped roof, still housing the original bell. The front facade boasts a three-bay design with a projecting pavilion, broken pediment, and oculus. On each side of the building, three bays are present. A metal fire chute runs diagonally across the rear, while the tall and narrow windows emphasize the verticality of the structure, especially on the front facade. Adorned with narrow clapboard, the eaves are embellished with dentils and modillions. \n\n\n== See also ==\nList of museums in Minnesota\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Downie Creek is in the West Kootenay region of southeastern British Columbia, Canada. Surrounded by the Selkirk Mountains, the creek is a tributary of Lake Revelstoke, part of the Columbia River. On BC Highway 23, the highway bridge is by road about 69 kilometres (43 mi) north of Revelstoke.\n\n\n== Creek profile ==\nThe creek valley is about 32 kilometres (20 mi) long and 800 to 1,600 metres (0.5 to 1.0 mi) wide. From headwaters in the Muloch Cluster, the river flows northwestward to its mouth.\nSignificant tributaries are Granite Creek, Boulder Creek, Long Creek, Standard Creek, Sorcerer Creek, Murder Creek, Pelkey Creek, Pass Creek, and Tumbledown Creek.\nIn the late 1970s, the inverted stratigraphy of the limestone was mapped over the 20 kilometres (12 mi) between Mt. Anstey and Carnes Peak, which encompasses the headwaters of the creek.\nIn fall 1984, flooding of the Revelstoke Dam reservoir began, which would submerge the former creek mouth and community. The gradual creation of the 8-kilometre (5 mi) arm eroded some of the sandy and silty material making up the creek banks.\n\n\n== Name origin ==\nIn 1865, four boatloads of prospectors left Marcus, Washington bound for the Big Bend Country. William Downie was one of the party leaders. During the Big Bend Gold Rush, steamboats ran from Little Dalles to Downie Creek or LaPorte. At the time, about a thousand miners camped at the creek. The earliest known documented mention of the name Downie's Creek is 1866 and Downie Creek is 1884.\n\n\n== River trails, roads, and boats ==\n\nFollowing the goldrush, nature would have quickly reclaimed any trail south of the creek mouth. However, a trail remained north of the creek, making the creek a suitable base for the Gold commissioner. By the mid-1880s, upgrading this trail to a wagon road was under consideration.\nSouth of the creek, only a rough trail extending 13 kilometres (8 mi) north of Revelstoke existed by 1891. When warranted, freight was carried by boat from Revelstoke and reloaded at the creek for the northward leg using George LaForme's pack train, which operated 1889–1905. By the mid-1890s, a pack train trail ran from Revelstoke to the creek. The S.S. Revelstoke operated the Revelstoke–Downie Creek run from 1902 during the summer months. By 1908, Five-Mile Landing was the departure point, while Downie Creek remained the northern terminus until 1915.\nIn 1913, a wagon road was built northward to the Goldstream River.\nThe gravelled Big Bend Highway northward from Revelstoke reached the creek in 1930 and the Goldstream River in 1931. Downie Creek was one of the few places along this highway where a break in the trees provided views of the mountains and the Columbia, which was 150 metres (500 ft) across at this location.\nDuring 1979, tenders were called for reconstructing 95 kilometres (59 mi) of the 140-kilometre (87 mi) Revelstoke–Mica Creek highway at a higher elevation than the planned reservoir.\n\n\n== Bridges and ferries ==\nTo access the northward trail along the Columbia, a bridge spanned the creek from at least the mid-1880s. When high water destroyed this structure in 1888, a rough boat for ferrying was temporarily installed. The next year, a new 67-metre (220 ft) bridge was erected.\nIn 1890, the bridge was again replaced, but a heavy snowfall during the 1891–92 winter destroyed the structure, requiring a rebuild of the 16-metre (54 ft) span and 8-metre (26 ft) approach the following summer. In 1894, the bridge washed out twice. During the intervening months, a ferry was used. The temporary bridge erected was 549 metres (600 yd) upstream. In 1895, the 78-metre (255 ft) replacement was built about 1.6 kilometres (1 mi) upstream from the original one. Months later, high water cut into the north bank, requiring rock fill and additional piles to prevent the loss of the bridge.\nIn 1896, high water took out two spans, requiring a temporary bridge. The next year, a ferry scow was built, cable installed, and service began. At low water, a temporary bridge replaced the 12-by-4-metre (38 by 12 ft) ferry. In 1898, a new 34-metre (110 ft) bridge (plus approaches) was erected.\nIn 1908–09, a new 33-metre (108 ft) queen truss bridge bridge (plus approaches) was built.\nIn 1930, a 37-metre (120 ft) howe truss was installed.\nIn 1967–68, the contract to replace the Mars Creek and Downie Creek bridges was awarded, the latter being 195 metres (640 ft) in length.\nIn 1983, the bridge for the rerouted higher elevation highway was tendered. The former bridge was dismantled and used for a new crossing at Boston Bar.\n\n\n== Community ==\nBy 1894, a government store existed. About this time, the expectation was that a townsite would soon develop, because the place was the northern terminus of steamer navigation on the Columbia. A proposal to build a hotel appears to have been postponed, but stopping places existed by 1897 at two ranches.\n\nThe former LaForme Half-way House for Pack Trains was likely the hotel seeking a liquor licence in 1910.\nWhen the completed Big Bend Highway opened in June 1940, Downie Creek was one of three points adjacent to the highway that were identified as suitable for gas stations and other roadside services. A combined gas bar/tearoom/store, plus three small guest cabins, opened in the early 1940s. To accommodate a highway realignment, the premises moved 800 metres (0.5 mi) in 1948. Greyhound buses stopped at the tearoom prior to the Rogers Pass highway opening.\nThe Downie Creek Recreation site, which is maintained by the Revelstoke Rod and Gun Club, comprises 22 sites, a day use area, and a good boat launch. Adjacent are the high-voltage transmission lines from the Mica Dam, which cross the reservoir.\n\n\n== Agriculture and forestry ==\nIn 1894, a few families took up pre-emptions on Four-mile flat (just south of the creek). Owners erected homesteads on this agricultural land. The excellent soil was expected to produce root vegetables to competitively supply the Revelstoke market.\nIn 1909, a logging camp operated at the river mouth.\nIn 1915, a forest ranger headquarters cabin was erected.\nIn the late 1940s, the core of a mountain pine beetle infestation existed at Downie Creek.\nA sawmill operated during the 1950s and 1970s. In the late 1970s, the pine beetle severity re-emerged.\n\n\n== Mining ==\nIn 1867, payable gold was found 13 to 16 kilometres (8 to 10 mi) from the creek mouth, but the creek was never systematically prospected.\nIn 1896, the province built a trail from Albert Canyon to the headwaters of Downie Creek to access several claims, including the Waverley. The next year, the trail was upgraded to a wagon road. A 3-kilometre (2 mi) trail linked to the Tangier claim, but a narrow-gauge railway line from Albert Canyon was under consideration.\nThe Waverley mine began shipping ore in November 1897. A revised railway route was north from Albert Canyon, northwest along Downie Creek, and south to Revelstoke. A store opened at the Waverley mine site. The avalanche danger ruled out railway construction. When Goldfields of BC had been floated in 1897 for £2 million, the Tangier and Waverley mines were the prime properties. A year later, uninstalled machinery lay scattered. The few tons of production ceased in 1899, and the assets were liquidated at great loss in 1901. At this time, the creek trail extended only 6 kilometres (3.5 mi) from the mouth. A decade later, only porcupines occupied the abandoned buildings of the two mines.\nIn 1920, a trail to the creek mouth was surveyed for the Waverley–Tangier mines. However, when Walters Investment Co. purchased the mine properties in 1921, the company built 13 kilometres (8 mi) of wagon road to Albert Canyon. Small crews rehabilitated the sites in 1924 and 1925, and active exploration in 1929 was promising. In 1951, 10 kilometres (6 mi) of road repairs to the Tangier site were abandoned because of forest fires. In 1987, geological mapping was conducted at both locations.\n\n\n== Maps ==\nrecreated Western Big Bend map. 1860s.\n\"West Division of Kootenay District map\". arcabc.ca. 1897.\nWestern Big Bend stratigraphy map. 1979.\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBilsland, William Winstanley (1955).

        "content": "The naturalization of Adolf Hitler is the process of naturalization that took place from 1925 to February 1932, when Adolf Hitler finally became a German citizen, being able from that moment to run for political offices.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nAdolf Hitler was born in Braunau am Inn in 1889 as an Austrian citizen. He moved allegedly first to the United Kingdom in 1912–1913, then to Germany in early 1914, just before the beginning of the World War I, then he served in the Imperial German army – also on the Western Front – until 1920. By 1919 he began his political career in the DAP (later transformed into NSDAP), which ultimately led him to try a putsch in Munich in November 1923.\nImmediately after its failure, he was tried and imprisoned for high treason for 9 months, in 1924. The Bavarian authorities attempted several times to deport Hitler to Austria shortly after his release, but the Austria refused.\n\n\n=== Statelessness (1925–1932) ===\nOn April 7, 1925, Hitler applied to the High Magistrate of Linz in order to be released from the Austrian citizenship:\n\nAfter some weeks, the request was granted and Hitler became stateless, stating it clearly and officially wherever he went.\nAt this point Hitler begun trying to acquire German citizenship in various ways, as he was involved also into rebuilding from the ground up the Nazi Party.\nThe easier way to become a German citizen was to become a Beamter, a German civil servant, because it automatically resulted in naturalization, in accordance to the 1913 Reich and Nationality Act.\n\n\n==== Naturalization attempts ====\nWilhelm Frick, the first Nazi minister in a German (local) cabinet and member of the national Reichstag in 1924, used his power first to try to force the Bavarian government to grant citizenship to Hitler in 1929, then to nominate Hitler as a professor in Art at the Bauhaus University in Weimar, but he failed, as the government was not willing to hire anyone new in that position.\n\nAnother attempt was made only a few months later, in July 1930: the Thuringian state parliament was on summer vacation and Frick took place as the forerunner of the political affairs in the meantime, as prescribed by the parliament's rules. He recognised that there were no objections to his plan of nominating Hitler as a Gendarmerie commissioner in an office of the Thuringian district town Hildburghausen. Everything was made as secret as possible and the task was accomplished, but Hitler ultimately refused that job and its relative certificate (because it semt to him that that job did not suit him even from a purely formal point of view), thus canceling the naturalization process attempt.\nThe next attempt was made at the Free State of Brunswick in 1931, where the local government was formed with some Nazi members: in particular the Interior Minister was the Nazi Dietrich Klagges, who had received the order directly from the NSDAP to naturalize Hitler quickly and who had the idea of appointing him professor for Organic Social Studies and Politics, by making a professorship vacant (the SPD member August Riekel was fired for this purpose). As the matter was going on, the debate on it exploded at the Braunschweig state parliament and thereafter the task became impossible to carry out.\nIn January 1932 the Köpenickiade of Schildburghausen was discovered and the oppositions formed a parliamentary committee of inquiry in front of which Hitler himself and several other nazi politicians had to answer (which he quite did not, not remembering most of the facts), not carrying out further legal prosecution of those events.\nHitler wanted to run for the 1932 presidential elections and he needed the citizenship quickly in order to be able to do that. Just after the \"process\" in January, Klagges had to involve the DVP in order to things in a discreet way. After some discussion (which arrived to involve even the nazi Hans Frank and Ernst Zörner, President of the Braunschweig State Parliament and friend of Hitler), a solution was found by nominating HItler in a position in the Brunswick legation to the Reichsrat in Berlin.\nFor the purpose of legal appearance, Zörner even got Hitler a residence in Braunschweig as his subtenant (officially reported from February 26, 1932, to September 16, 1933).\nOn February 26, 1932, Hitler was sworn in at a ceremony in the Berlin Hotel Kaiserhof, at the same time receiving the citizenship in the Free State of Braunschweig and of the entire Reich, which was formally completed on March 1, 1932.\n\n\n==== Aftermath ====\nIn 2007 there was an attempt to revoke Hitler's German citizenship, but it was found that it is impossible, being Hitler dead.\n\n\n== Motion pictures ==\nHitler: The Rise of Evil (2003)\n\n\n== See also ==\nAdolf Hitler's rise to power\nHarzburg Front\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Neermoor is a village in the region of East Frisia, in Lower Saxony, Germany. Administratively, it is an Ortsteil of the municipality of Moormerland. Located to the west of the river Ems, Neermoor is approximately 8 kilometers to the north of Leer. It has a population of 4,748.\n\n\n== History ==\nNeermoor is a subsidiary settlement of Edana and was probably founded further east on the edge of the moor before its demise in the 11th century. The oldest documented mention dates back to the year 1400. In one document Neermoor is listed as Edenramora. Later name variants were Nymramore (1409), Eramoere (1428), Edramora (1436), Eddermore (1439), Neydermoer (1481), Neddermoer (1494) and Neermohr (1577). The place name is probably derived from the desolate parent settlement of Edana.\nDuring the Middle Ages there were two castles owned by the East Frisian chieftains Focko Ukena and his son Uko Fockena in Neermoor. A castle stood on today's Vossbergweg at the corner of the Burgstrasse. The second stood between today's Osterstrasse and Süderstrasse.\nIn 1422, a small church was built away from the village center on a hill near the old cemetery, which was replaced by the Reformed Church from 1797. The Old Reformed Church dates from 1865.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nFocko Ukena (1360/1370–1435), East Frisian chieftain\n\n\n== References ==",

He was a publisher of the same class as Louis Hachette and Pierre Larousse, and is said to have begun his company in 1876.: 780  \nHis book Les Anaglyphes geometriques described \"Vuibert's principle of anaglyphic vision\" based on a \"procedure invented by Louis Ducos du Houron, which consisted in printing, in superimposition, pairs of stereoscopic views, taken in complementary colors\". This book and the concepts therein are said to have \"inspired Marcel Duchamp's interest in anaglyphs\". Les Anaglyphes geometriques \"set the standard\" for representation of 3D in two dimensions and offered a \"grand tour of shape\" that influenced both artists and mathematicians alike.\nAlso, according to one account, it was Vuibert, not Eutaris, who first worked out what is now called a Taylor circle.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Vuibert, H.

        "content": "Marie Antoinette Guiraud (October 31, 1832–June 5, 1909) was a French-American pioneer and rancher in Colorado Territory. Born in Gard departement in France, Marie Antoinette Chabreat married Adolphe Guiraud in 1848 and set sail for New Orleans, Louisiana, one year later. \nAfter living in Ohio and Kansas, the Guirauds settled in Colorado Territory, where they homesteaded land for their farm and ranch at the beginning of the 1860s. After her husband's death, she expanded their 640-acre ranch to 5,000 acres. \nAdolphe Guiraud died in 1875, and Guiraud successfully managed the hay farm and ranch. In 1879, she had a town called Garo, platted and bought and sold land for the town. After the Colorado Midland Railway established a station at Garo, the town grew to include stores, businesses, a church, a school, and an opera house. Also in 1879, Guiraud filed a water rights suit, which became a landmark case, establishing her \"right of prior approbation\" of the water.\n\n\n== Life in France ==\nMarie Antoinette Chabreat was born in the Gard departement in Southern France on October 31, 1830. Little is known about her early years besides being born on a farm. \n On March 28, 1848, she married Adolphe Guiraud, age 26, from Leon, France. His family members were wine merchants. Adolphe's brother immigrated to New Orleans, Louisiana, and became a successful merchant. In December 1849, Guiraud and her husband set sail for an eight-week voyage to New Orleans on the ship Adair.\n\n\n== Early years in America ==\nGuiraud gave birth to their son on March 28, 1850, in New Orleans or in 1850 in France. After a month, the Guirauds traveled to Cincinnati, Ohio, where Adolphe engaged in several occupations. He was first a wine dealer, but his building burned down. Adolphe then ran a farm followed by a bakery. \nThe couple each began a business in Leavenworth, Kansas, but Guiraud had to shut down her coffee shop due to ill health. Adolphe made plans with Frank Maywell to start a business in the Colorado Territory to capitalize on influx of people to Colorado during the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. Adolphe and Maywell, his partner, opened a mercantile business in Hamilton at Tarryall Creek. About 1862, Adolphe ended the partnership. While Adolphe was in Colorado Territory, Guiraud stayed behind in Kansas where she raised three sons and in 1861 she gave birth to a daughter.\n\n\n== Rancher and farmer ==\n\nThe following year, Adolphe picked up his family, and moved to Colorado Territory. The family homesteaded a 160-acre parcel in Park County, Colorado at what became the town of Garo, The ranch was near Trout Creek and the South Fork of the South Platte River. which was named after Marie and Adolphe Guiraud. They operated a ranch and a farm, cultivating oats, wheat, and vegetables.\nAfter their son, Henry Eugene, died accidentally at the age of ten, the family moved to Denver, and the couple ran a meat market for a year. They then returned to their homestead claim with a baby girl born in 1865. Guiraud had more children, for a total of ten offspring by 1873. \nThe Guirauds opened a meat market in Fairplay to sell their meat, or a grocery store, but he closed the business after the many people he gave credit to did not pay their bills. Successful farmers and ranchers, the Guirauds expanded their ranch to 640-acres and in 1867, they built the Guiraud Ditch to irrigate their farmland. \nAdolphe died in October 1875, and was interred at the Fairplay cemetery. Guiraud raised their surviving seven children, ranging in age from 2 to 25 years.  She became a wealthy livestock rancher, having the area's largest sheep herd. She sold cattle and horses and hay. She expanded the ranch to 5,000 acres valued at $200,000 (equivalent to $6,782,222 in 2023). Her sons worked her ranch or established their ranches.\nBy 1879, new settlers diverted water from Trout Creek, reducing what was available to Guiraud's farm. Guiraud filed suit against the neighbors, becoming a landmark Colorado water rights case. Guiraud established that her family had used the water since they settled the land, and due to the \"right of prior approbation\", she won the case after several years at court.\n\n\n== Real estate dealer ==\n\nAs railroad service extended into Colorado, Guiraud planned to establish a town, believing that a railroad would come to the area. She hired civil engineer Fred Morse to plat the town of Garo, after her husband, using the English pronunciation of their surname. She acquired, sold, and leased land, and the town grew after the Colorado Midland Railway established a station at Garo. The railway also transported livestock and hay to Denver.  At its height, the town had a school, mercantile, church, hotel, saloons, sawmill, livery, blacksmith, and an opera house.\n\n\n== Later years and death ==\nIn 1906, her large house was completely razed by fire, reportedly by sparks from a Colorado and Southern Railroad train. She had a new house built that was a \"fine, ten-room, one-story building.\nGuiraud died on June 5, 1909 at her home in Garo, Colorado and is buried with her husband at the Fairplay cemetery. Five of her ten children were alive at the time of her death. After her death, $80,000 (equivalent to $2,712,889 in 2023) in gold was reported to have been stored in her cellar.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBjorklund, Linda (2010).

        "content": "WatZatSong (stylized as WatZat♫Song?), is an American and French music identification and social networking website created by French programmers and co-founders Raphaël Arbuz and Thibault Vanhulle in 2006.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe website allows users to upload applicable .mp3, .aac, .wav, .m4a and .ogg files. A user can upload these files onto the website if logged in, and other users can comment and recommend certain YouTube videos or musicians.  Both the uploader and other users can speculate on whether a certain proposal is the legitimate song or artist in a Proposals section under the post's information by liking or disliking the proposal. Once the post is solved, a seekbar will appear above the post, allowing users to listen to the full solved song. The post will remain open for discussion unless the uploader deletes the post.\nUsers have the option to purchase a Premium pass on the website before uploading their post, enabling their upload to be featured on the front page. Premium applies to individual posts and can be bought repeatedly for different uploads the user posts.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe websites concept was proposed in 2005 by Raphaël Arbuz and Thibault Vanhulle, after uncovering an interest in online music quizzes. Whilst doing a quiz, both of them heard a song that they had no recollection of remembering. Vanhulle conceived an idea of creating a website where you could hum a tune, and it would uncover the songs information. Arbuz followed along with the idea, and they started early coding and production of the website in 2005–2006. They also joined one of Arbuz's classmates, Erez Abittan, who would be a contributor of the website as well.\nDuring the development of the website, Arbuz noted that the most challenging aspect was creating a Java applet for an audio recording system. Neither Arbuz nor Vanhulle acquired a Flash server from Adobe, which complicated the development of creating a functional recording software, excluding the use of Adobe Flash; which carries easier technologies in creating a recording system. \nWatZatSong was subsequently published in 2006 following the creation of a functioning recording system. The website wouldn't start gaining attention until the 2010s, when music enthusiasts congregated to the platform to identify and listen to elusive songs shared by users, one most popular example, The Most Mysterious Song on the Internet, being one of the main contributors to the sites popularity during the 2010s. The majority of visits to the website are still attributed by music enthusiasts, and due to this, WatZatSong.com averages 800,000 visits monthly, and holds a notable position as the #1,336 most visited site in the music category as of 2024. \nIn 2018, BIG MAGE EOOD, published a mobile app for WatZatSong. The app follows the same premise as the main website, albeit major layout changes. The app was last updated in 2021.\nOver the history of WatZatSong, the website has become a hotspot for lost media, most notably lostwaves, songs with no coherent information. A notable example is Everyone Knows That, a song uploaded to the website in 2021 by a user named carl92.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLostwave\nLost media\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "This article provides a list of political scandals in Croatia:\n\n\n== 1990s ==\n\n\n== 2000s ==\n\n\n=== Fimi Media scandal (2007) ===\nThe Fimi Media scandal is one of the most significant corruption cases in Croatia's political history. The scandal revolves around the misuse of state funds and illegal financing of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) party. The Fimi Media marketing agency played a central role in funneling money into the HDZ's slush funds.\nFormer Prime Minister Ivo Sanader was at the heart of the scandal. He and his co-defendants were charged with siphoning around 70 million kuna (€9.3 million) from state-owned companies and institutions through Fimi Media into the HDZ's illicit funds between 2004 and 2009. Sanader was found guilty in multiple corruption cases related to Fimi Media, along with other scandals like the Planinska and Ina - MOL cases. HDZ was fined 3.5 million kuna (roughly €460,000) and ordered to return around 14 million kuna.\n\n\n=== INA-MOL scandal (2008) ===\n\nThe scandal involved allegations of bribery related to the management rights of INA, a major Croatian oil company, being handed over to MOL, a Hungarian oil company. Former Prime Minister Ivo Sanader was accused and subsequently convicted of accepting a bribe from MOL's head Zsolt Hernadi. Sanader was sentenced to six years in prison for this crime. The court found that Sanader and Hernadi had agreed that, in exchange for a €10 million bribe, they would ensure changes to agreements concerning the Croatian oil company INA, granting MOL controlling influence.\n\n\n== 2010s ==\n\n\n=== Consultancy Affair (2013) ===\nTomislav Karamarko, who was the Deputy Prime Minister of Croatia and the leader of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), resigned due to a scandal involving a conflict of interest. An ethics commission ruled that there was a conflict because of his connections to a lobbyist for the Hungarian oil company MOL, which was in dispute with the Croatian government over the control of INA, a Croatian firm1. This led to a vote of no-confidence and raised the prospect of early elections. \nIt was revealed that his wife had business dealings with Josip Petrović, a lobbyist for MOL, the Hungarian oil company involved in a dispute with the Croatian government over the management of INA, Croatia's national oil company. Critics argued that this presented a conflict of interest, given Karamarko's governmental position and Croatia's ongoing arbitration proceedings with MOL.\n\n\n=== Software Affair (2017) ===\nThe Software Affair involved former Croatian Minister Gabrijela Žalac from the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) party. It centered around the procurement of a software program worth 16.2 million kuna (approximately €2.1 million) awarded to a company called Ampelos by the Ministry of Regional Development and EU Funds during her tenure. The company, based in Podstrana near Split, was reportedly led by individuals who were close associates of Žalac, and it was the sole bidder in the tender published in 2018.Žalac, along with the head of the state's finance and contracting agency SAFU, Tomislav Petric, and two other persons, were arrested in an ongoing corruption investigation by the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) in Croatia. The investigation related to the public procurement of this information system and the alleged crimes committed in the ministry and SAFU.Furthermore, a Zagreb County Court indictment panel rejected the application by Žalac's defense counsel to exclude text messages she had exchanged with former state secretary Josipa Rimac from evidence in the case. These messages were related to the mismanagement of European funds for software procurement. The EPPO charged Žalac and others with defrauding the EU and Croatian budgets of more than €1.3 million. Žalac faced charges of abuse of position and authority and of influence peddling, among other accusations.\n\n\n=== Brothel Scandal (2019) ===\nToni Turčinov, the mayor of the Murter-Kornati municipality in Croatia, spent €1,560 from the municipality's budget at the Austrian brothel called La Cocotte. He used the official card of the Municipality of Murter-Kornati for this purpose. The Office for the Suppression of Corruption and Organized Crime (USKOK) initiated an investigation into Turčinov's actions.\n\n\n== 2020s ==\n\n\n=== \"Skipping the Line\" Affair (2020) ===\nSlavko Linić, a former Croatian minister from Social Democratic Party of Croatia (SDP), became the center of controversy when he acknowledged receiving the COVID-19 vaccine ahead of his designated priority group. Similarly, Marko Primorac from Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), the current Croatian Minister of Finance, along with his wife, Iskra Primorac, a high-ranking state official, admitted to receiving COVID-19 vaccinations ahead of their scheduled turns.\n\n\n=== The “Secret Club” Scandal (2020) ===\nIn 2020, a scandal known as the “secret club” rocked Croatia's political and business scene. It involved a clandestine gathering in the Croatian capital where the elite flouted lockdown rules, escorts were brought in from Serbia, and vintage wine and whiskey flowed. Bribes allegedly changed hands during these gatherings.\nThe incident began with the arrest of Dragan Kovačević, the chief executive of Jadranski naftovod - JANAF (Adriatic Oil Pipeline Operator), under allegations of influence trading and accepting bribes. Kovačević, who had shifted allegiance from the Social Democratic Party (SDP) to the pro-business Croatian People's Party (HNS) after an unsuccessful presidential campaign, was appointed to lead JANAF following the victory of an SDP-HNS coalition in the 2011 parliamentary elections.\nOne of the visitor was Jakov Kitarović, husband of former President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović from HDZ, who frequented the club while she was still in office. Later it became known that her successor, incumbent President Zoran Milanović from SDP, also visited the club on several occasions. President Milanović defended himself by saying that he came there to eat leftover food.\n\n\n=== Wine Envelope Affair (2020) ===\nTomislav Tolušić, a former Croatian Minister of Agriculture and a member of the HDZ party, is under investigation by both European and domestic authorities for alleged financial misconduct involving EU funds and national subsidies related to the \"Wine Envelope\" program. Arrested in May 2022 by the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO), Tolušić is accused of illegally obtaining EU funds for his winery, totaling over 2.5 million kunas ($375,000) through regulations he himself enacted while in office. Additionally, he's facing charges for misrepresenting assets to secure further EU grants. Tolušić has defended his actions by citing a positive review from the Commission for Deciding on Conflicts of Interest, allowing his participation in the subsidy tender.\n\n\n=== Bribe for Mayor (2021) ===\nDirector of Croatia's public broadcasting company Croatian Radiotelevision (HRT) carried 50 thousand euros to Milan Bandić, mayor of Croatian capital Zagreb, on behalf of a friend to arrange permits, claims Croatian Bureau for Combating Corruption and Organized Crime USKOK.\n\n\n=== Stealing from construction site (2022) ===\nStjepan Turković, a prominent member of the HDZ party, was caught stealing iron reinforcement from a construction site along with his son. The incident took place at the road construction site in Karlovac. Turković, who has held numerous party duties over the past 30 years, was serving as an advisor to the director of the County Road Administration at the time. The theft was documented in photographs.Road Administration made the decision not to fire him, with the explanation that he was stealing outside working hours.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Dora Richards Miller (1842–1914) was a Danish West Indies-born American author and educator.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nDora Richards was born in the Island of St. Thomas, Danish West Indies. Her father, Thomas Richard Richards (d. 1844), was from Liverpool, England, and her mother, Philomena (née, Huntington) Richards (1806–1846), was also of English descent, through Hezekiah Huntington, of Connecticut. Hezekiah was Dora's grandfather and belonged to the same family from which came Samuel Huntington, signer of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. The death of her father while she was yet an infant caused Dora to be taken to the home of her Huntington grandmother, Mary (née, Smith) Huntington (b. 1771), in the neighboring island of Santa Cruz. Hurricanes and earthquakes were among Dora's experiences there, and not long before she left the island, the 1848 St. Croix Slave Revolt took place, which resulted in the emancipation of the enslaved in all the Danish Islands. Dora's mother, with the other children, had removed to New Orleans, Louisiana, but it was not until after her mother's death, when Dora was about 14, that she joined there her unknown brothers and sisters, to reside in the family of a married sister.\nShe was graduated with distinction, her school-girl essays having for several years attracted attention, and the editors of a New Orleans paper invited her to contribute to their journal. She had prepared herself for the profession of a teacher and undertaken the support and education of a young brother, and thought it best to give all her powers to that work.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1862, she married Anderson J Miller (1836–1867), a lawyer from Mississippi, and they went to Arkansas to reside. Troubles resulting from the civil war caused the breaking up of her family, and some of their experiences during the siege of Vicksburg are recounted in her articles published in The Century Magazine, entitled \"Diary of a Union Woman in the Siege of Vicksburg\" and \"Diary of a Union Woman in the South\". Her husband died soon after the close of the war, leaving her with two infant sons, Alton (1864–1909) and Warren (1865–1889).\nShe returned to teaching in public schools, rising steadily from grade to grade, till she was appointed to the chair of science in the girls' high school of New Orleans. During those busy years, she wrote in the local papers, without name, on education topics.\nIn 1886, her \"War Diary\" was published in The Century. Those articles attracted great attention.\nIn 1889, she wrote, in collaboration with George Washington Cable, \"The Haunted House on Royal Street\", being science teacher in the high school held in that building when it was invaded by the White League. She was correspondent for the Austin, Texas, Statesman during the World Cotton Centennial (New Orleans, 1884). She was assistant editor of a paper published in Houston, Texas, and wrote for Lippincott's Magazine, the Louisiana Journal of Education, the Practical Housekeeper and other journals.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\nA Woman's Diary of the Siege of Vicksburg: Under Fire from the Gunboats, 1885 (text)\nWar Diary of a Union Woman in the South (undated) (text)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Works related to Woman of the Century/Dora Richards Miller at Wikisource\nDora Richards Miller, via dotcw.com (Daily Observations from The Civil War)\nDora Richards Miller–War Diary of a Union Woman in the South, via cw-chronicles.com (American Civil War Chronicles)\n\"New Orleans Notes.

        "content": "Terborg is a small village in the region of East Frisia, in Lower Saxony, Germany. Administratively, it is an Ortsteil of the municipality of Moormerland. Located on the north bank of the river Ems, Terborg is approximately 8 kilometers to the northwest of Leer. It has a population of 105.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nTerborg was first mentioned as Burchum in 1357. In 1564 it was mentioned as Neyeborg on a topographic map. Other early names are Torborch (1684), Ter-Borg (1735) and Terborg and Ferstenborg (1787). Three explanations are possible for the interpretation of the place name. For example, with the prefix ter-, the preposition and the article to der (East Frisian Low Saxon: zu der) could have merged to form ter-. According to Petra Spekker, the syllable -borg could mean not only \"castle\" but also \"place of refuge\" on the Ems. Ubbo Emmius, however, interpreted the name as \"tri borgi\", as \"three castles\", because in the Middle Ages the castles Terborg, Mittelsterborg, and Woltersterborg were lined up in Terborg on the Kleiweg from Oldersum to Neermoor. Petra Spekker does not consider this explanation to be unlikely, as Terborg was also referred to as Ferstenborg, which means \"foremost castle\".\n\n\n== History ==\nTerborg probably arose around 1000 AD as a farming and fishing village on a warft on the Ems. In contrast to its neighboring villages Oldersum and Neermoor, Terborg never developed into an important place. In the Middle Ages, the place initially belonged to the Emsgau, later to the Moormerland under the rule of the Cirksena to the Leerort district, after its dissolution in 1817 to the Leer district, from which the Leer district emerged in 1885.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Terborg (Moormerland) at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Thomas Pellett (1671? – 4 July 1744) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPellett was born in Sussex about 1671, and was admitted at Queens' College, Cambridge, on 8 June 1689. He graduated M.B. in 1694, and in 1695 went to Italy with Dr. Richard Mead, and resided in the university of Padua. In 1705 he was created M.D. at Cambridge, and on 22 December 1707 was admitted a candidate at the College of Physicians in London, where he began practice, and resided in Henrietta Street, Covent Garden; he was elected a fellow on 9 April 1716, was censor in 1717, 1720, and 1727, and president 1735–9. He delivered the Harveian oration on 19 October 1719, and it was finely printed in quarto by S. Buckley of Amen Corner. It is remarkable as the only one of the published Harveian orations which is partly in verse, and the only one in which a knight of the Garter, John, second duke of Montagu, a doctor of medicine of Cambridge, is congratulated on having become a fellow. The works of Linacre, Glisson, Wharton, and Harvey are well described, and the whole oration is both graceful and lively. Pellett edited Sir Isaac Newton's ‘Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms’ with Martin Folkes in 1728. He felt the difficulties of private practice keenly, and inclined to give his time chiefly to medical study and to general learning. He died in London on 4 July 1744, and was buried in St. Bride's Church, Fleet Street, where he is commemorated by an inscription on a brass plate. His portrait, painted by Michael Dahl, hangs on the staircase of the College of Physicians, and was engraved by John Faber (Bromley).\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1895). \"Pellett, Thomas\".

        "content": "Christmas Holiday is a novel by the British writer Somerset Maugham, first published in 1939 by Heinemann. Just before the outbreak of the Second World War a naïve young Englishman travels to Paris to broaden his mind. There he meets a White Russian émigré Lydia, now working as a prostitute. She tells him both of the death of her father during the Russian Revolution abd her subsequent marriage in Paris to a man who then murdered his own friend. Despite knowing of his guilt she secretly sends money to him on the prison island in French Guiana because she is still in love with him.\n\n\n== Film adaptation ==\nIn 1944 it was adapted into the American film of the same title often classified as a film noir, directed by Robert Siodmak and starring Deanna Durbin and Gene Kelly.  While the original story takes place in pre-war Europe, the adaptation shifts the setting the wartime New Orleans in Louisiana.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nCalder, Robin.

        "content": "Paul Menzerath (1 January 1883 – 8 April 1954) was a German linguist and experimental phonetician. He discovered that in German, longer words used shorter syllables (based on phonemes) and he suggested that other languages may also follow this principle and was able to confirm it for Spanish. It was later examined by Gabriel Altmann and the rule is called Menzerath's law or the Menzerath-Altmann law.\nMenzerath was born in Düren, son of tailor Johann and Elisabeth née Weiler. A Catholic, he was first educated at his home town. He joined Freiburg in 1903 and then changed to Berlin, Marburg, Würzburg, Kiel, Geneva, and Paris. He listened to lectures by Levy, Lommatzsch, Puchstein, Rickert and Steup in Freiburg, Dessau, Dessoir, Diels, Ebeling, Helm, Imelmann, Klebs, Less, etc. Luschan, Menzer, Pariselle, Paulsen, Rawitz, Rothstein, Schmidt, P. Schultz, Wilhelm Schulze, v. Stradonitz, Stumpe, Thomas, Vahlen, Wentzel, v. Wilamowitz Moellendorf, Winnefeld in Berlin, Ach, Biiit, Justi, Kalbfleisch, Natorp, Scharff, Thiele, Thumb in Marburg, Külpe, Schneegans, Weygandt in Würzburg. One of his teachers was Albert Thumb (1865–1915)  who was interested in familiarity, fluency and reaction time in experiments. These had applications in truth testing people. His PhD in linguistics and philology was from the University of Würzburg in 1906. He then joined the Institute of Psychology at Uccle, Belgium. In 1914 he was expelled from the lab during World War I and he then served in the military for a year. He then worked as a lecturer of French at Bonn University. In 1916 he returned to Belgium at the University of Ghent and in 1917 he was forced to leave again to the University of Bonn where he remained until the end of World War II. His habilitation in 1920 was on psychology and experimental phonetics and his dissertation was titled Die Aufgabe und Methodik der experimentellen Phonetik (‘Tasks and methodology of experimental phonetics’). Although he had observed the inverse association of word and syllable length in German, it was only in 1928 that he formally examined his prediction of syllable length and word length in Spanish in collaboration with Jesuit researcher J. M. de Oleza. They examined 1432 words that contained 3888 syllables and 8440 sounds. They declared that the shorter the sound, the longer the word in which it is used - they called it the phonic law of quantity. He established a phonetic laboratory in Bonn which was destroyed by aerial bombing during World War II in October 1944.\nMenzerath married Marguerite Kingma in 1914. She suffered from illness and her treatment forced Menzerath to mortgage his house. She died in the 1930s. During the Nazi era he was a member of the Deutsche Volkpartei and a supporting member of the SS but he did not play an active role. In 1943 he was accused of having made derogatory remarks on Hitler during a trip to Sweden and for praising Heinrich Heine.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Edward Peart (1756? – November 1824) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPeart was born about 1756, was M.D. and a corresponding member of the London Medical Society. He practised for some time at Knightsbridge, but afterwards removed to Butterwick, near Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, where he wrote on numerous scientific topics. He was chiefly known for his works on physical and chemical theory, which involved him in polemics with the critical magazines. Although an acute critic both of Joseph Priestley and Antoine Lavoisier, he failed to grasp the distinction made by the latter chemist between ponderable matter and caloric, and hence his constructive theories, though ingenious, were unsound and sterile, and discredited his criticisms. Peart in his ‘Animal Heat’ (1788) explained all chemical and physical phenomena by assuming the existence of four elements—æther, phlogiston, the acid principle, and earth. In the following year these were reduced to three, two active principles, æther and phlogiston, and one fixed. When a fixed particle is surrounded by an atmosphere of particles of æther radiating from it in straight lines, it forms an earthy (i.e. alkaline) particle; a phlogiston atmosphere producing an acid particle (The Elementary Principles of Nature, pp. 24, 285). All actions ‘at a distance,’ corresponding to the phenomena of electricity, magnetism, and gravitation, are explained by means of these ‘atmospheres.’ The least fantastic of Peart's books are those on physiology and medicine. In his ‘Animal Heat’ Peart revives the idea of John Mayow that animal combustion takes place in the substance of the muscle and not in the lung, as Lavoisier thought. In the same book he sees clearly that the constant temperature of animals in exercise and at rest must be due to a correlation of various functions, and investigates the matter experimentally in a somewhat rough way. The formula ‘excitability of the muscular fibres is the great characteristic of life in animals’ (loc. cit. p. 91) is still accepted. In his medical works he shows himself untrammelled by the school teaching of his day, and his independent observation of nature should have exerted a useful influence on his contemporaries. He used simple drugs, and ascribed their beneficial effects to direct action on the materies morbi of the disease. Peart declares (On the Composition of Water, p. 67), ‘I write for amusement at my leisure hours,’ and (Physiology, preface, p. xiii) ‘I have no expectation of making converts to my peculiar views.’ He seems to have made none. From his writings, and in spite of his controversies, Peart appears as a man of kindly though erratic tendencies. In his ‘Physiology’ (p. 280) and elsewhere he vigorously protests against the unnecessary vivisections of his time.\nPeart died at Butterwick in November 1824.\nThe following is a list of Peart's works: \n\n‘The Generation of Animal Heat,’ 1788.\n‘The Elementary Principles of Nature,’ 1789.\n‘On Electricity,’ 1791.\n‘On the Properties of Matter, the Principles of Chemistry,’ &c., 1792.\n‘On Electric Atmospheres [with] a Letter to Mr. Read of Knightsbridge,’ 1793.\n‘The Antiphlogistic Doctrine … critically examined … [with] Strictures on Dr. Priestley's Experiments on the Generation of Air from Water,’ 1795.\n‘On the Composition and Properties of Water, with a Review of Mrs. Fulhame's Essay on Combustion,’ 1796.\n‘Physiology,’ 1798.\n‘On Malignant Scarlet Fever and Sore Throat,’ 1802.\n‘On Erysipelas and Measles,’ 1802.\n‘On Rheumatism, Inflammation of the Eyes,’ &c., 1802.\n‘On Inflammation of the Bowels,’ 1802.\n‘On Consumption of the Lungs,’ 1803.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Hartog, Philip Joseph (1895). \"Peart, Edward\".

        "content": "Matthew Pattenson (fl. 1623) was an English royal physician and Catholic controversialist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPattenson was a medical practitioner in the reign of James I, and was appointed physician in ordinary to Charles I. He wrote ‘The Image of Bothe Churches, Hiervsalem and Babel, Vnitie and Confusion, Obedienc [sic] and Sedition. By P. D. M.,’ Tournay (Adrian Quinque), 1623, 8vo, pp. 461; London, 1653, 12mo, pp. 643. Dedicated to Charles, prince of Wales. Gee, in his ‘Foot out of the Snare,’ 1624, mentions the work as by ‘M. Pateson, now in London, a bitter and seditious book.’ The authorship is also ascribed to Pattenson in the preface to Foulis's ‘History of the Romish Treasons and Usurpations,’ 1671; and by Wood, who states that the contents of the work were ‘mostly collected from the answers of Anti-Cotton, and John Brierley, Priest’ (Athenæ Oxon. ed. Bliss, iv. 139). Charles Butler highly commends the work, remarking that ‘in a short compass it comprises much useful information, and many excellent observations, arranged methodically, in a style always perspicuous, and generally elegant’ (Hist. Memoirs of the English Catholics, 3rd edit. iv. 453).\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Cooper, Thompson (1895). \"Pattenson, Matthew\".

        "content": "\"Like That\" is a song by American rapper Future, American record producer Metro Boomin and fellow American rapper Kendrick Lamar. It was sent to US rhythmic radio through Freebandz (under the business name Wilburn Holding Co.), Boominati Worldwide, Epic Records, and Republic Records as the third and final single from Future and Metro's collaborative studio album, We Don't Trust You, on March 26, 2024. Solely produced by Metro himself, the three artists wrote the song alongside Kobe Hood; Rodney-O & Joe Cooley are also credited as songwriters as the bass line in the song contains samples of their 1986 song, \"Everlasting Bass\". \"Like That\" also has additional elements that contain samples of Eazy-E's 1989 single, \"Eazy-Duz-It\", and contains a vocal sample of Michel'le.\nA trap and hardcore hip hop song that is predominantly composed of lively percussions, \"Like That\" received positive reviews from music critics, who primarily praised Lamar's performance. His verse, which attracted significant media coverage, is a diss aimed at fellow rappers Drake and J. Cole; some outlets consider it to be his response to their 2023 collaboration, \"First Person Shooter\". \"Like That\" was quickly met with commercial success, debuting atop the Billboard Hot 100, Global 200, and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts simultaneously. It was both Future and Lamar's third number-one single on the former chart, and Metro's first as a credited artist. The song also topped the Canadian Hot 100 and peaked within the top ten of several countries in Europe and Oceania.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn October 6, 2023, Drake released the song \"First Person Shooter\" as part of his album For All the Dogs, with rapper J. Cole, in which the latter shouts out the two rappers and Kendrick Lamar as the \"big three\" of rap music. Additionally, Drake indirectly called out Metro Boomin in December 2023 for being a \"tweet and deleter\" after the latter posted a tweet on Twitter aimed at him.\n\n\n== Composition and lyrics ==\n\"Like That\" is a \"bouncy\" trap and hardcore hip hop track driven by \"rapid\" and \"uniquely southern\" percussions, as well as a \"menacing\" bassline. It samples two songs: Rodney-O & Joe Cooley's \"Everlasting Bass\" (1988) and Eazy-E's \"Eazy-Duz-It\" (1989). Metro Boomin, who has greatly admired the former group, contacted Rodney-O through his record companies and asked for his permission to use the sped-up sample on \"Like That\". He approved after listening to a version of the song that cut off before Lamar's verse started.\nLyrically, Lamar uses his surprise appearance to directly respond to \"First Person Shooter\", rapping: \"Yeah, get up with me, fuck sneak dissing / \"First Person Shooter\", I hope they came with three switches\". He also rejected J. Cole's idea of the three rappers representing hip hop as its \"big three\" and claims that he alone takes the top spot: \"Motherfuck the big three, nigga it's just big me\". Throughout his verse, Lamar compares his rivalry with Drake to Prince's reported feud with Michael Jackson (\"What? I'm really like that / And your best work is a light pack / Nigga, Prince outlived Mike Jack\"). Drake has notably compared himself to Michael Jackson on numerous occasions, including during the final verse of \"First Person Shooter\", and Lamar has similarly compared himself to Prince. Lamar also makes references to the Click (\"Niggas clickin' up, but K.Dot be legit / No 40 Water\") and Stephen King's 1983 novel Pet Sematary (\"'Fore all your dogs gettin' buried / That's a K with all these nines / He gon' see Pet Sematary\").\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nAngel Diaz of Billboard ranked \"Like That\" as the third best song on We Don't Trust You. Diaz wrote that the track is \"Hip-Hop in its purest form\" and described it as \"the album’s thesis\".\nAndrew Sacher of BrooklynVegan argued that the Lamar appearance feels \"like an event\" and \"another great one\" at that, as he shows up in a \"chest-out, no-bullshit mode\" on the track. Carl Lamarre at Billboard thought that Lamar appeared on the track with \"vitriol\" while delivering \"an explosive verse\". HotNewHipHop's Alexander Cole called the beat a perfect fit for Future, \"who glides over the track at the beginning and end\". Dylan Green of Pitchfork thought, \"It's guest Kendrick Lamar who provides the song's showstopping moment, dropping the therapeutic malaise of 2022's Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers in favor of coming directly at contemporaries J. Cole and Drake after years of subliminals.\"\n\n\n== Responses ==\nOn April 5, on his mixtape Might Delete Later, J. Cole would go on to diss Lamar on the song \"7 Minute Drill\". 2 days later, Cole would go on to apologize to Lamar for the diss and within the same week the track was removed from all streaming platforms.\nOn April 13, a diss track by Drake, unofficially titled by fans as \"Push Ups\" or \"Drop and Give Me 50\", leaked on social media, targeting Future, Metro Boomin, Lamar, the Weeknd and Rick Ross. Two versions of the track were leaked, the first containing a sample of Junior M.A.F.I.A.'s track \"Get Money\", most famously sampled in rapper Tupac Shakur's diss track \"Hit 'Em Up\", and the latter omitting the sample and adding an extended sung outro. On April 19, Drake officially released the latter version as “Push Ups”. \n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nUpon the release of We Don't Trust You, \"Like That\" earned 10.26 million on-demand streams in the United States and 7.21 million streams on Spotify globally. It peaked atop the Spotify U.S. chart with 3.73 million first-day plays, besting its closest competitor by nearly 400,000 streams. Within its first three days of availability, the song accumulated 25.62 million streams in the country. Several of Drake's songs saw a noticeable increase in streams due to \"Like That\", such as \"First Person Shooter\" (10 percent) and \"What Would Pluto Do\" (34 percent).\n\"Like That\" debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 for the chart issue dated April 6, 2024, with 59.6 million streams, 9,000 digital downloads sold, and an airplay audience of 5.6 million. It marked Future and Lamar's third number-one single in the country and Metro's first as a billed recording artist, having co-written and co-produced previous chart-toppers \"Heartless\" by the Weeknd (2019) and \"Bad and Boujee\" by Migos featuring Lil Uzi Vert (2016). \"Like That\" also debuted atop the Billboard Global 200 with 91 million streams and 10,000 copies sold worldwide, becoming Future, Lamar, and Metro's first number-one single, and at number six on the Global Excl. US chart with 31.9 million streams.\nThe single premiered atop Billboard's Streaming Songs chart as Lamar's fourth, Future's third and Metro's first number-one song. It marked the largest opening week for a track since Taylor Swift's 2022 single \"Anti-Hero\" (59.7 million), and the best streaming week for a hip hop song since Drake's 2021 single \"Way 2 Sexy\" featuring Future and Young Thug (67.3 million). Additionally earning the biggest streaming week of any song in the U.S. in 2024 so far, it tallied the most streams in a single week since Miley Cyrus' 2023 single \"Flowers\" (59.7 million streams during its second week of charting).\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Abki Baar 400 Par (Hindi: अबकी बार, 400 पार, lit. 'This Time for 400 seats') is a Hindi slogan used by the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The slogan seeks to publicise the target set by Modi and his party alliance National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to win 400 of the 543 Lok Sabha seats in the 2024 general election.\nThe BJP has used the slogan in earlier elections, such as the 2019 general election, albeit with various modifications. It now serves as both a rallying cry and a representation of the party's political goals for its adherents.\nThe national leadership of the party, including Prime Minister Modi, Party President J P Nadda, and Amit Shah, have actively used the slogan while campaigning at political rallies.\nElection analysts have said that the path for the BJP to achieve this goal will likely be by winning more seats in the south of India than in previous elections.\n\n\n== Opposition remarks ==\nOn 2 February 2024, during the Motion of Thanks on the President's address, I.N.D.I.A. bloc's leader Mallikarjun Kharge made remarks on BJP's 400 paar claim. Taking a jibe at the claim he said:\n\n\"Aapka itna bahumat hai, pehle 330, 334 thi, ab toh '400 paar' ho raha hai\" (lit.'You have a majority of 330, 334 seats and 400 is being crossed now')\nPrime minister Modi considered it as an endorsement of the “abki baar 400 paar\" slogan.\nKharge later, raised the issue stating two pages from speech were removed, distorting the intent of their speech. Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar after listening to the recording of the speech gave his ruling to the issue, stating Kharge had plenty of time to revisit his words during his speech.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nExperts have debated over whether it is realistic that the BJP could win 400 seats.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMain Bhi Chowkidar\nBharatiya Janata Party campaign for the 2024 Indian general election\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Samuel William Langston Parker (1803 – 27 October 1871) was an English surgeon.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nParker was the son of William Parker, a medical practitioner in the Aston Road, was born in Birmingham in 1803. He received his early education in the school of the Rev. Daniel Walton in Handsworth. He afterwards attended the medical and surgical practice of the Birmingham General Hospital, his more strictly scientific training being obtained in the school of medicine at the corner of Brittle Street, Snow Hill. He then came to London and entered St. Bartholomew's Hospital for the purpose of attending the lectures of John Abernethy. He afterwards went to Paris to complete his studies. He was admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1828, and he became a fellow of that body honoris causâ in 1843, the year in which the fellowship was established. He assisted his father for a short time after he obtained his qualification to practise, but in 1830 he married and began to practise on his own account in St. Paul's Square, Birmingham.\nParker took a keen interest in the development of Queen's College, Birmingham, becoming, at an early period of its history, professor of comparative anatomy, and of descriptive anatomy and physiology—posts which he held for a quarter of a century. His services to the Associated Hospital date from the foundation of that important charity in 1840, and he discharged the duties of honorary surgeon for five-and-twenty years. On his retirement he became consulting surgeon, an appointment which he held till his death. He was also consulting surgeon to the Leamington Hospital for Diseases of the Skin. He was an active promoter for many years of the Birmingham Philosophical Institution in Cannon Street. In 1835–6 he delivered in this institution a remarkable course of lectures ‘On the Effects of certain Mental and Bodily States upon the Imagination.’\nParker began life as a general practitioner of medicine, subsequently he became a surgeon, and eventually devoted his best energies to the treatment of syphilis. In this department of practice he soon obtained a world-wide reputation; but, although he introduced new methods of treatment, he failed to advance the scientific knowledge of the disease.\nParker had a cultivated musical taste, was an enthusiastic playgoer, an accomplished French and a good Italian scholar. He died in Paradise Street on Friday, 27 October 1871, and was buried at Aston.\nHe was author of: \n\n‘The Stomach in its Morbid States,’ 8vo, 1837. This work was subsequently condensed into\n‘Digestion and its Disorders,’ 8vo, 1849.\n‘The Modern Treatment of Cancerous Diseases,’ 4to, 1857.\n‘Clinical Lectures on Infantile Syphilis,’ 1858.\n‘The Treatment of Secondary Syphilis,’ 8vo, which reappeared in 1868 as\n‘The Mercurial Vapour Bath,’ 8vo.\n‘The Modern Treatment of Syphilitic Diseases,’ 1st edit. 1839, 2nd edit. 1845, 3rd edit. 1854, 4th edit. 1860, 5th edit. 1871.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Power, D'Arcy (1895). \"Parker, Samuel William Langston\".

The team currently plays in the Serie A1, Italy's highest professional league. \n\n\n== Previous names ==\nDue to sponsorship, the club has competed under the following names:\n\nGranda Volley Cuneo Armando BreBanca (2003–2005)\nArmando BreBanca Cuneo (2005–2009)\nArmando Edilscavi Cuneo (2009–2012)\nCuneo Granda Volley (2012–2014)\nBreBanca S.Bernardo Cuneo (2014–2017)\nUBI Banca S.Bernardo Cuneo (2017–2018)\nBosca S.Bernardo Cuneo (2018–2022)\nCuneo Granda S.Bernardo (2022–2023)\nHonda Olivero S.Bernardo Cuneo (2023–present)\n\n\n== History ==\nCuneo Granda Volley was founded in 2003 and started playing in Serie C of the Italian league. In 2005 the club was promoted to Serie B2 where it played until 2009. Then a few seasons in the lower division Serie C followed before Cuneo Granda Volley was promoted to Serie B2 again in 2014. In the following season Cuneo Granda Volley finished in second place in the regular season in pool A of Serie B2. While the club was eliminated in the promotion playoffs it was still promoted to Serie B1 due to repechage.\nIn its first season (2015–2016) of Serie B1 Cuneo Granda Volley finished the regular season in third place in pool A, but failed to reach the promotion spot in the playoffs. The following season (2016–2017) Cuneo Granda Volley again finished the regular season in third place and this time the club won the playoffs and was promoted to Serie A2.\nIn its debut season (2017–2018) in Serie A2 the club finished in second place in the regular season, but in the promotion playoffs it was eliminated in the semifinals by Chieri '76. However, by acquiring the rights to play in Serie A1 from River Volley the club was still able to advance to the top division the following season. As of 2024, Cuneo Granda Volley's best result in Serie A1 is a seventh place in the regular season (2020–2021 and 2021–2022) and the quarterfinals of the championship playoffs.\n\n\n== Team ==\nThe following is the roster for the 2023–2024 season.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Fort Harssens is a former fortress and museum in Den Helder North-Holland. It protected the naval base Willemsoord. The fortress had 4 heavy naval guns placed in two armored cupolas. Nowadays, the maritime traffic control center sits on top of the fortrress.\n\n\n== Planning and construction ==\n\n\n=== Den Helder is gets fortified ===\n\nIn the late eighteenth century, a harbor was constructed at the Nieuwediep (river). This later became the naval base Willemsoord. Due to the construction of the Noordhollandsch Kanaal, Den Helder also became the access to the port of Amsterdam. Soon, plans were developed to cover Den Helder with fortifications. In 1803 Jan Blanken made a plan to built a fort in the water just outside the base. Another plan called for a fort in the Marsdiep of about 80 guns and 500 men. These first plans were not executed. \nIn 1811 Napoleon visited Den Helder and saw the potential of the site. He ordered the construction of the first fortresses and a big naval base. This led to the Fortifications of Den Helder and the naval base Willemsoord. The daring plans for a fortress in the water were not excuted. \n\n\n=== A plan for Fort Harssens ===\nIn 1875 the minister of war Enderlein came with a specific plan to build a fortress on the shoal Harssens, on the east bank of the Nieuwediep. By 1875 a plan had been made for a fortification at Harssens. An investigation of the grounds was already underway. Enderlein wanted to postpone all other plans till this was ready.\nThere were many other plans. Weitzel and others wanted a fort in sea at the shoal 'De Laan'. Van Stirum and others a fortress on the shoal 'Zuidwal' to the northeast of Harssens. Others did not want to do anything until there was an overall plan for the defense of Den Helder.\nIn 1879 Minister of War Den Beer Poortugael took action by amending the fortifications budget law for 1879. 300,000 guilders were alotted for Fort Harssens. The total cost of the fortress was estimated at 1,050,000. There were some doubts about the plan, but many also understood that in view of the higher cost of alternatives, Fort Harssens was a realistic and effective option. In 1880 another 200,000 guilders were allotted to the fortress.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\nOn 16 August 1879, the construction of the flood resistant glacis of the fortress was awarded to contractor J.J. Bakker from Lent for 143,900 guilders. In 1879 a commission of officers visited Germany and its coastal fortresses of Langlütjen. It noted that with the new high caliber guns, buildings in front of the guns would not be inhabitable. This led to a design change. In 1880, the total cost of the fortress was estimated at 1,344,000 guilders.\nIn mid-1880 the Minister of War Reuther asked for 261,000 guilders extra to place two orders. The first was to buy the first two 30.5 cm MRK L/25 guns, a test carriage and 100 shells for 221,000 guilders at Krupp. The second was to order a minimum port-carriage (Minimalscharten Lafette) for 40,000 guilders at Gruson in Magdeburg. The first gun was necessary for a test at Krupp's. The second gun was needed to test the minimum port-carriage. These two orders would allow the armored cupolas to be put in place in the Summer of 1883.\nIn December 1880 the construction of the actual (brick) fortress was tendered. The tender was wun by P. Duinker from Nieuwediep for 329,447 guilders. By November 1881, the total expected cost of the fortress had increased to 1,455,160 guilders.\nIn Spring 1883 the first parts of the armored cupolas arrived in Nieuwediep. The 55t heavy armor plates of the cupola would also arrive by rail. The special company lighter H. Cruson was sent to Nieuwediep in order to transport the plates over the Nieuwediep. The lighter carried a wagon on which the plates would be transloaded, on the other side, the vessel align its rail with that on the shore, by using a hydraulic system. A steam engine would then tow the loaded wagon up to the fortress.\nIn February 1885 a test of the artillery took place. After firing a few shots, some damage led to the suspension of the tests. On resumption of the tests, an elevation cylinder filled with glycerol broke and put the second carriage out of action. In Den Helder some windows broke due to the pressure waves. When the final and official tests took place in September 1885, the guns were fully loaded. During this test, hundreds of windows were broken, and local politicians asked for compensation.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== The concept ===\n\nThe plans for Fort Harssens were based on the idea that by itself, the fortress would have to be able to fight a strong enemy fleet and resist it. Therefore, the fortress had to be well armored and armed with guns of high caliber. Already in 1879, it was known that the Minister of War wanted the fortress to get two armored cupolas with two 30.5 cm MRK L/25 guns each. That year, the minister explained that at a distance of up to 2,400 m, the 30.5 cm Krupp guns were able to penetrate the armor of the heaviest battleship that could approach Den Helder. This would allow the fortress to prevent these ships from getting so close that they could seriously hurt the fortress.\nSome members of parliament wanted to economize by using lighter guns and compensating for this by using heavier armor. The minister explained that the 30.5 cm MRK L/25 gun could penetrate a 40 cm thick armor plate at 2,900 m while a 28 cm gun could only do this up to a distance of 1,700 m. Using the lighter 28 cm would allow enemy ships to approach the fortress more closely, allowing them to destroy the fortress by repeated hits at the same spots of the armored cupolas. Some members of parliament doubted this, because the minister did think lighter guns good enough for the fortress at IJmuiden. The minister then explained that Den Helder had a wide stretch of deep water in front of it, allowing enemy ships to maneuver in front of it. At IJmuiden, enemy ships could only close in by steaming up the outer parts of the canal, making them an easy target.\n\n\n=== The value of the armored cupolas ===\nThe Dutch government had made some tests of the cupola's armor against its new Krupp 25 cm L/25 gun part of its contract with Gruson. The tests got a lot of international attention. They were attended by the whole German artillery test commission, Henri Alexis Brialmont, the Japanese and Chinese ambassadors etc.\nEach of the three kinds op plates that were used in the fort had to be able to withstand four shots hitting close to each other. One of these tests took place on 22 October 1883. The target was a mock-up cupola of several armor plates. The first target was a 'front plate' that was to be in a fixed position before the lower section of the turning cupola. It had a maximum thickness of 1,060 mm. The gun, mounted on its minimum port carriage, stood 27 m from the mock-up cupola. With the fourth hit from the gun, the armor plate broke and parts of it fell inside, thus failing the test. The second target was a plate that formed part of the side armor of the cupola itself. The results were similar to the previous test. The third test took place in May 1884 against a top plate of the cupola and was quite successful.\nWhile the cupola failed the test, the interpretation of the results was not that easy.  For some experts, the test definitely showed that the Gruson's chilled iron (Hartguss) armored cupolas were no longer relevant after Krupp replaced its Hartguss shot with its steel grenades (Stahlgranate), and that earth work fortifications were better. Others noted that the first three shot had not penetrated the armor.\nAs principle of these tests, the Dutch Ministry of War had the most information. A commission that attended the tests concluded that the front plates were not good enough and also required a different position and more support, so no loosened parts could fall out of position. Positive notes were that the shot had not penetrated the armor, and that the Gruson chilled iron was of a uniform quality. The net result of the test was that the  front plates were not accepted, and Gruson was told to improve these. For the cupola plates, some minor changes were made, primarily with regard to how they were fitted to the wrought iron underside of the cupola. The commission also noted that for calculating the resistance of armor, the nature of each individual shot and the vis viva that was actually brought to bear due to the angle at which the shot hit, were essential.\n\n\n== Usage ==\n\n\n=== First years ===\nIn 1886, the Dutch Ministry of War formed a new organization to man the three armored fortresses that were under construction: Harssens, IJmuiden, and Hoek van Holland. Each of these would get a separate Pantserfort Compagnie. On 1 May 1886, the Harssens Company was founded. On 1 September 1922, the Pantserfort companies became part of a coastal artillery regiment.\nIn January 1887, new exercises did not lead to any damage. This was thought to be due to the direction of the wind. On the contrary, at Terschelling the loud shots led to steamboats seeking for a ship in distress. In August 1887, there were new exercises. This time, some Rijkswaterstaat buildings at Koopvaarders Lock lost a few windows.\n\n\n=== Later years ===\nExercises with big guns always posed a serious danger for shipping. Therefore, there was always an official advance warning. One of the last warnings of firing guns from the fortress dates from 1926. However, there were still some very minor investments in improving the effectiveness of the fortress in 1929.\nSomewhere in these years, the big guns were relinguished from service. In the evening of 31 August 1933, fireworks were ignited on the dam east of the Nieuwediep. Inadvertently, three fires were started in the grasses on the dam and on the fortress. This made for a spectacular sight. A tugboat and naval personel intervened and put out the fire after about half an hour. Fears that there was still ammunition in the fortress proved unfounded.\n\n\n== World War II ==\nIn May 1940, invading German forces took control of the fortress. By then, the guns and cupolas were obsolete. They were dismantled in order to re-use the metal.\n\n\n== Post World War II ==\n\nThe old naval base Willemsoord had been designed for 19th century ships of the line. Already before World War II, Dutch ships like the flagship De Ruyter were too long for the old harbor. Therefore, a plan was made to construct a new base at Den Helder. This plan created the Nieuwe Haven. This was planned on the east bank of the Nieuwediep and would be made by raising the level of the grounds east of the Nieuwediep. About 200 m south of Harssens, a 170 m long stretch of the east dam of the Nieuwediep would be removed to create an entry from the Nieuwe Haven to the Nieuwediep and the old base. Fort Harssens would get a connection to the mainland by a bridge over the Nieuwediep.\nIn 1952, there were plans to build an office for the Nieuwe Haven on of the old fortress. This was done, and so the fortress disappeared from view because the dry moats were filled up and the office hid the top of the fortress.\nIn relation with the plans for a new office and maritime control center, one of the dry moats was excavated in 2009. This was to see what was left of it. In 2016, a serious renovation was started. The fortress is now open to the public for guided tours, but is still military terrain.\nOn 12 July 2011 the new Haven Coördinatie Centrum Den Helder was officially opened by Mrs. Elisabeth Post, deputy of the King's commissioner in Noord-Holland. The so-called Vessel Traffic Control Center controls military and civilian maritime traffic to and from Den Helder.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFort op de Harssens\nAt Stelling Den Helder\nSome recent photo's of the fortress\n\n\n== References ==\nVan Alphen, Marc (1993). \"Het Gibraltar van het Noorden\".

        "content": "Henry Park (2 March 1744–5 – 28 January 1831) was an English surgeon.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPark was the son of a Liverpool surgeon, was born in that town on 2 March 1744–5, and received his early education under the Rev. Henry Wolstenholme. At fourteen he was placed with a surgeon at the Liverpool Infirmary, and when only seventeen had the care of a large number of French prisoners of war. He then went to London to enter upon an apprenticeship to Percival Pott, and subsequently completed his studies at Paris and Rouen. In 1766, when he was about twenty-one, he settled in his native town, and in the following year was appointed surgeon to the infirmary, a post which he held for thirty-one years. He retired from work at the age of seventy-one, after a professional career of extreme activity, and with the deserved reputation of a bold, original, and successful practitioner. He is best remembered by his ‘Account of a New Method of Treating Diseases of the Joints of the Knee and Elbow,’ 1783, 8vo, which was translated into French in 1784 (Paris), and into Italian in 1792 (by Brera, Pavia). It was afterwards published with Moreau's ‘Cases of Excision of Carious Joints, with observations by J. Jeffrey,’ Glasgow, 1806. The operation which led to the writing of this book is described by the ‘Edinburgh Review’ (October 1872) as one of the greatest surgical triumphs of the time. Park died, near Liverpool, on 28 January 1831.\nHe married, in 1776, the eldest daughter of Mr. Ranicar of West Leigh Hall, Leigh, Lancashire, by whom he had eight daughters and a son, John Ranicar Park.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Sutton, Charles William (1895). \"Park, Henry\".

        "content": "Yuke-Tepe, Yuki-Tepe, height 1025 (Ukrainian: Юки-Тепе, Crimean Tatar: Yüke Töpe, Юке Тёпе), is a mountain of the main range of the Crimean Mountains, the southwestern part of the Orta Syrt yaila. It is located in the Simferopol Raion. It has a dome-shaped, deciduous forest-covered summit, with a height of 1025 metres. During the World War II here several formations of Crimean resistance during World War II were based, and hard battles were fought. At the top, searchers built many memorial signs to commemorate the partisans.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe name in translation from Crimean Tatar means \"linden peak\" (yüke — linden, töpe — peak). The height of the highest point is 1025 metres. The summit has the shape of a horseshoe (whence another later name) with its horns orientated to the north-west. The south-eastern slope is steep and has a rock wall. It is covered with beech-oak-hornbeam forest.\nThe mountain is located in the Simferopol Raion. From the west, the peak is separated by a deep valley of the Burulcha river. On the other side of the valley, even further west Dedov Kuren mountain, 1016 metres, is located. To the south of Yuke-Tepe runs the valley of a tributary of the Burulcha, named Partizanka on a number of maps. To the east and north is another unnamed tributary of Burulcha with a non-permanent watercourse. Its valley separates Yuke-Tepe from the main massif of the southern part of Orta Syrt. On the other side of the valley to the north of Yuke-Tepe is the tract of Mokrousov Rocks, named after the headquarters of the Crimean partisan movement under the command of A. V. Mokrousov.\nOn the southern slope of the mountain, above a rocky ledge is a viewpoint on Tirke yayla. In other directions, due to forest cover, the view from the summit of Yuke-Tepe is limited.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn November 1941, the area of Zuya forests became the base of the 2nd district of the Crimean partisans (Zuya and Karasubazar forests), which included Karasubazar, Dzhankoy, Ichkinskiy, Kolay, Seitler, Zuisky, Biyuk-Onlar detachments, and later Red Army detachment No. 1 and Red Army detachment No. 2.\nThe network of deep river valleys (Burulcha, Malaya Burulcha, Suvat) between Dolgorukovskaya yaila, Yaman-Tash ridge and Orta-Syrt yaila gave the guerrillas opportunities for manoeuvre and retreat. Even after temporary retreats during large sweeps, the area was soon reoccupied by partisans. Additionally, its value lay in the presence of the Small Partisan Airfield in the north-east of Orta Syrt.\nThe command of the 2nd Partisan District was based at the height 1025. In 1941-1942, the headquarters of the 2nd Partisan District headed by I. G. Kurakov and I. S. Bedin was here. In 1944 the command post of the Northern connection of the Crimean partisans (commander P. R. Yampolsky, commissar N. D. Lugovoi). The underground Crimean Regional Party Committee was housed here for some time. The partisan radio station communicated with the \"Big Land\".\nThe site of persistent fighting during the \"Big Search\" on 22–25 July 1942, when the German-Romanian troops tried in vain to completely clear the Crimean mountains of partisans.\nIn the sanitary tents of the hospital of the 2nd district on the eve of the battle near the mountain Yukiye-Tepe in the Burulcha riverbed on 25 July 1942 there were 62 sick and wounded people. Doctors Ya. A. Ruban, S. G. Mitler, N. P. Kostrubey and nurses Vera Shiro, Alla Muslumova, Olya Shilkina, Melanya Tarlakova and others rendered them medical aid. At dawn on 25 July the enemy managed to infiltrate the area. The wounded and staff fought back to the last cartridge. Among those killed in the battle were doctor Nina Petrovna Kostrubey and military paramedic Kirill Grigorievich Naidenko.\n\n\n== Monuments ==\n\n\n=== Partisan cannon ===\n\nOfficial name: Memorial sign to partisan artillerymen on Yuki-Tepe Mountain (height 1025). 44.846375°N 34.430557°E﻿ / 44.846375; 34.430557\nIt was built in 1962 by Komsomol members. This three-inch cannon was left by Soviet troops in the area of Barabanovka during the retreat to Sevastopol. Partisans sheltered the gun and later dragged it by hand up Yuke-Tepe mountain. During the fighting of the summer of 1942, from the forested height of 1025, it fired on the nearby hills. Gun commander Senior Lieutenant Alexander Fedorov. Settlement N. Pletnyov, P. Savchenko, A. Boychenko, V. Kluge. When the ammunition ran out, the partisans threw the gun down a steep slope so that the enemy would not get it. For about 20 years the cannon lay at the bottom of the gorge. In 1966, on Victory Day, Komsomol searchers returned the cannon to the top and created a memorial around it. At the height, which overlooks the cliffs of Tyrke, there are several mass and individual graves of partisans who died in that unequal battle.\nThe cannon is in satisfactory condition despite its age. The quality steel resists corrosion, the rifling in the barrel has been preserved. The wooden carriage is more damaged. On the barrel there is an inscription: \"S. St. Petersburg foundry, No. 196, 1902\".

        "content": "Sur Televisora Itapúa, also known as Sur TV, is a Paraguayan television station located in the city of Encarnación, Itapúa. The station is a generalist outlet with national reach since 2013. For its first 37 years on air, it was a partial relayer of SNT, before becoming an independent channel within the Albavisión group.\n\n\n== History ==\nWork was underway in 1975 for the creation of Paraguay's first inland television station, which was under the control of channel 9 in Asunción.\nTV Itapúa started broadcasting on December 3, 1976, as the first of two SNT relays that served as affiliates - the latter of which, the later Paraná TV, started in 1980 - broadcasting a VHF signal on channel 7. Until 2013, thanks to an agreement, the two SNT stations outside Asunción relayed much of the network's schedule, yet were affiliates in their own right, producing their own local programming for up to six hours each day.\nAmong the local programs that stood out during the SNT affiliate phase was Reporteritos, a program aimed at children, in the second half of the 2000s.\nIn early August 2013, the two SNT affiliates were to be converted into two new national television channels, Televisora del Este (channel 8, Presidente Franco) and Televisora Itapúa SA (channel 7, Encarnación). Marcelo Fleitas, president of SNT, claimed that the two stations were unable to expand their coverage due to technical considerations. Moreover, SNT decided not to have affiliates outside of Asunción, unifying the capital's feed with the rest of the country, under the grounds that when the decision was taken, only Ciudad del Este was still considered a strategic location for Paraguay's economy. The president of the network, raising concerns over Albavisión controlling four television channels in Paraguay, said that SNT, Paravisión, PTV and Sur were independent channels, and that \"it's wrong to say that the owner of Channel 9 now has four channels\". Facing this situation SNT's national service announced that it would start broadcasting on the frequencies formerly held by the affiliates in Alto Paraná and Itapúa, whereas TVP and Sur would start broadcasting to Asunción (and nationwide) by means of Conatel decree nº. 1631/2012. This decree stipulated that Sur TV should broadcast in Asunción on channel 10 and PTV, on channel 12. Local programming on these two stations was limited, due to lack of budget.\nConcerns were being rased at Conatel over the legality of these licenses mere days after the decision was taken. The issue lied in the relays the three stations wanted to build in each other's coverage areas, which did not appear in the 2011 regulations, whose primary intention was to give incentives for the installation of digital terrestrial television signals in the country. A modification was accepted to Catelpar in 2012, after a rejected petition in 2011, under the grounds that the guidelines suggested only new relay stations and not new licenses. In September, members of the Chamber of Deputees demanded an inquiry to the situation. SNT was granted channel 9 in Presidente Franco and channel 8 in Encarnación (adjacent to the existent channels), PTV was granted channel 12 in Fernando de la Mora, channel 9 in Encarnación and channel 13 in the Ybytyruzú Hills, and Sur TV, channel 10 in Fernando de la Mora, channel 7 in Presidente Franco and channel 11 in the Ybytyruzú Hills.\nBy mid-September, PTV and Sur TV started experimental broadcasts earlier than expected. SNT spent US$2,5 million in the overall project of setting up relay stations.\nSur TV started broadcasting as an independent service on November 25, 2013. The official launch of the reconverted service featured the presence of vice-president of Paraguay Juan Afara and notable guests from the press and political sectors, among them vice-governor of the province of Misiones Hugo Passalaqua and the channel's first director, Jorge Mateo Granada. The channel broadcast 18 hours a day, from 6am to midnight, in the new format. The channel resumed broadcasting ABC Rural, produced by ABC Color, coinciding with its 600th program. At the time, all the other television stations that carried the program were local cable channels.\nThe channel's oldest employee, Feliciano Espínola, left the channel due to his retirement on July 31, 2018.\nA fire broke out at the channel's facilities on the morning of August 21, 2022, affecting its equipment.\nIn 2023, the channel held, in association with the Catholic University of Itapúa, a course for journalists in training, between October and December of that year.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSUR Televisión on Facebook",

        "content": "M. Restiau, also known by the anagramatic pen name Eutaris, was a French mathematician who first postulated what is now known as a Taylor circle.\nAccording to an 1895 article by John Sturgeon Mackay about triangle symmetry, \"The property, that the six projections of the vertices of the orthic triangle on the sides of the fundamental triangle are eoncyclic, seems to have been first published in Mr Vuibert's Journal du Mathématiques Alimentaires in November 1877. See Vol. II. pp. 30, 43. It is proposed by Eutaris. This name, as my friend Mr Maurice D'Ocagne informs me, was assumed anagrammatically by M. Restiau, at that time a répétiteur [tutor] in the Collège Chaptal, Paris.\" An article in L'Intermédiaire des mathématiciens from 1895 adds one biographical detail but also floats a different credit: \"Le premier croit que la signature Eutaris était le pseudonyme (par anagramme) de M. Restiau, ancien élève de l'École Polytechnique, répétiteur au Collège Chaptal en 1877 ; M. Vigarié, au contraire, croit que l'article dont il s'agit avait pour auteur M. Vuibert.\" A machine translation by Google reads, \"The first [J. S. Mackay] believes that the signature Eutaris was the pseudonym (by anagram) of Mr. Restiau, former student of the École Polytechnique, tutor at Collège Chaptal in 1877; Mr. Vigarié, on the contrary, believes that the article in question was authored by Mr. Vuibert.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nVuibert\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nVigarié, Émile (1887).

The villagers staged a peaceful protest against the eviction.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe state government of Assam has initiated an investigation, to be overseen by a retired High Court judge, into the violence that occurred on Thursday. The cameraman Bijay Bonia, responsible for the fatal attack, has been apprehended and remanded to judicial custody for 14 days by a local court.\nSome 800 families were displaced during the operation to remove encroachments at Dholpur since Monday. The state aims to reclaim 4,500 bighas of government land for an agricultural initiative. According to the police, the locals pelted them with stones, leading to the use of necessary force.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Emily Catherine Prudden (June 13, 1832 – December 25, 1917) was an American educator and home missionary, credited with founding at least fifteen schools in rural North Carolina and South Carolina, including Linwood Female College and Pfeiffer College.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nPrudden was born in Orange, Connecticut, the daughter of Joseph Prudden and Charlotte Heminway Prudden. Her father was a farmer who was active in Congregational Church work. \n\n\n== Career ==\nPrudden left Connecticut in 1878, to work at Berea College in Berea, Kentucky. She was house mother at Brainerd Institute in Chester, South Carolina in 1882. After those schoolwork experiences, she founded more than a dozen schools in North and South Carolina, mostly for young women, serving both white and Black students. Though the schools were racially segregated, she faced some local opposition to her work. After she started schools, she arranged for the American Missionary Association or other Protestant religious organizations to assume responsibility for their ongoing operation. She retired from school work in 1909.\n\n\n== Schools founded by Prudden ==\nAll of the schools founded by Prudden were in rural western North Carolina and South Carolina. Many were staffed by Northern women teachers, sponsored by religious or missionary organizations, and offered community services such as clothing and food distribution, in addition to educational programs.\n\nLinwood Female College, Gaston County\nOberlin Home and School, near Lenoir; became Pfeiffer College\nSkyland Institute, Blowing Rock\nLincoln Academy, Kings Mountain\nPrudden School, Avery County\nElk Park Academy, Avery County\nMount Herman Academy, Saluda\nSaluda Seminary, Saluda\n\n\n== Personal life and legacy ==\nPrudden was deaf from the age of 17, and had arthritis. She raised her sister's children in Connecticut and edited a Christian periodical before beginning her career as an educator in her late forties. She died in 1917, at the age of 85, in Hickory, North Carolina. \nSince 1966, Pfeiffer University has held an annual Emily Prudden Lecture, featuring \"outstanding and recognized women who have achieved distinction in some area of professional life or public service and who make a distinctive contribution to the college community\". Pfeiffer College's centennial monument, dedicated in 1984, is a tribute to Prudden. In 1991, a historical marker was placed in Blowing Rock, about her work.  In 1996, Pfeiffer dedicated a statue of Prudden on campus. In 2013, an outdoor drama about Prudden, named The Legacy of Lick Mountain, was produced in Saluda, North Carolina.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPhoebe A.

        "content": "Aeva Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: AEVA) is a publicly traded American corporation specializing in sensing hardware and perception software, including LiDAR, headquartered in Mountain View, California. Aeva makes sensing and perception tools for  vehicular automation, metrology, and industrial automation.\n\n\n== History ==\nAeva was founded in 2016 by entrepreneurs Soroush Salehian and Mina Rezk, who previously worked in Apple's Special Projects Group and at Nikon. Following a $3.5 million seed round in 2017, the company came out of stealth mode and raised a subsequent $45 million Series A from Lux Capital and Canaan Partners. The company then raised a corporate round from strategic investors including Porsche SE, and Lockheed Martin. In 2021, Aeva merged with InterPrivate Acquisition Corp. to raise over $560 million and trade publicly on the NYSE under the ticker symbol, AEVA. Aeva also announced a $145 million capital raise with existing long-term stockholders in 2023. To date, Aeva is the only LiDAR company that Porsche SE has invested in.\nIn 2021, Aeva chose Fabrinet as its contract manufacturer to produce its CoreVision \"LiDAR-on-Chip\" modules.\nIn that year, Nikon was Aeva's first industrial metrology customer, and TuSimple completed the industry's first fully autonomous drive using Aeva's sensor.\nIn 2022, Aeva was the first 4D LiDAR company enabled on Nvidia Drive autonomous-vehicle platform. In 2022, NASA enlisted Aeva's technology to help astronauts map and navigate the moon for upcoming Artemis missions.\n The company also signed with SICK AG to provide its 4D LiDAR technology to industrial automation equipment.\nIn 2023, Railergy signed on to use Aeva's technology to help automate Deutsche Bahn Cargo's locomotives by identifying obstructions on and around rails. Also in 2023, May Mobility selected Aeva's technology for its next-generation Toyota Sienna autonomous transit vehicles, supplying multiple sensors per vehicle for thousands of May Mobility vehicles through 2028.\nIn 2024, Daimler Truck and its subsidiary Torc Robotics announced the selection of Aeva's 4D LiDAR technology for its autonomous vehicle program, which begins production in 2026 with autonomous Freightliner Cascadia trucks sold for use on U.S. roads in 2027.\n\n\n=== Technology ===\nAeva develops what it describes as \"4D LiDAR\" using Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) technology to detect 3D position and instant velocity for every point simultaneously. Unlike conventional \"Time of Flight\", or 3D LiDAR, which measures depth and reflectivity, Aeva's 4D LiDAR uses a continuous, low-power laser beam to measure the change in frequency of the wave as it reflects on an object to detect velocity in addition to reflectivity and depth.\nAeva's technology is the first to simultaneously achieve high resolution (up to 4 million points per second) at long ranges. It has a maximum detection range of 500 meters, can detect pedestrians and bicycles beyond 350 meters, and ground drivable regions beyond 200 meters.\nAeva's technology is free from interference from other LiDAR sensors and sunlight. It is designed to enable autonomous vehicles to see with higher resolution at distances around 500 meters.\nAeva developed \"LiDAR-on-Chip\" technology, using silicon photonics that integrates the core optical components into a module capable of being produced in high volumes, in contrast to other long-range LiDAR that uses fiber optic lasers and components that are difficult to mass-produce.\nAeva developed X1 \"System-on-Chip\" processor technology, known as an application-specific integrated circuit, that integrates data acquisition, point-cloud processing, scanning, and application software in a single, mixed-signal chip.\nAeva's technology comes to centimeter-level accuracy at hundreds of meters of range for automotive applications and micron-level accuracy at tens of meters for industrial metrology applications.\n\n\n=== Products ===\n\n\n==== Aeries I ====\nAeries I (a-sample), with a 120-degree field-of-view, was unveiled at CES 2020 and was used for development and testing by Audi's Autonomous Intelligent Driving (AID) division as well as commercial autonomous trucking pioneers TuSimple and Plus.\n\n\n==== Aeries II ====\nIn February 2022, Aeva released Aeries II (b-sample) as its first 4D LiDAR sensor with a 120-degree field-of-view using its \"LiDAR-on-Chip\" technology. Aeries II was 75% smaller than its predecessor, allowing a wider range of sensor integration points in automotive and non-automotive applications and designed for automotive-grade reliability requirements. The sensor was the first to use Ultra Resolution, a feature delivering real-time camera-level images with no motion blur, providing up to 20 times the resolution of conventional LiDAR sensors.\n\n\n==== Atlas ====\nIn 2023, Aeva released Atlas (c-sample) at CES 2024 as its mass-production intent sensor. Atlas is 70% smaller than Aeries II, made possible by Aeva's innovations in custom silicon technology, including the Aeva CoreVision fourth generation \"LiDAR-on-Chip\" module and Aeva X1, a powerful \"System-on-Chip\" LiDAR processor. Daimler Truck was also announced as the first customer of Atlas in a $1B agreement.\n\n\n=== Operations ===\nAeva is headquartered in Mountain View, California, and has operations in Milpitas, California. Other operations are in New York, China, Germany, India, and Thailand.\n\n\n=== Industry Recognition ===\nTime Magazine Best Invention of 2022 (Aeries II 4D LiDAR)\nCES 2023 Innovation Award Honoree (Aeries II 4D LiDAR)\nReuters Automotive D.R.I.V.E  2023 Innovation Honours Shortlist\n\nAutoTech Breakthrough Awards - Overall Auto Sensor Company of the Year 2021 & 2022\n\n\n== See also ==\nLiDAR\nLuminar Technologies\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "David Hillman (1893 – 14 May 1974) was a Lithuanian born British portrait and stained glass artist.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHillman's father was Shmuel Yitzchak Hillman, Head of the London Beth Din from 1914 until his retirement in 1934 at which time he immigrated to Israel. His ancestors included Rashi and the Maharal of Prague.\nBorn in Lithuania in 1893, he arrived in Glasgow with his family in 1908. At 15 years old, he sought entry as a student at Charles Rennie Mackintosh's new Glasgow School of Art. This was to his father's displeasure, as he was an only son and appeared to be prepared to break a tradition of father-son rabbis. He was awarded scholarships for a total of 12 years at the school and, after his parents’ move to London in 1914, at the Royal Academy, where he graduated in 1920.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nHillman studied portraiture under  William Orpen and John Singer Sargent, and stained glass under Sir George Frampton. During this period, largely coincident with the First World War, he engaged in biblical studies and then graduated as a rabbi, receiving his ordination from the Sephardi Chief Rabbi, Moses Gaster. He was appointed Minister at the Sandys Row Synagogue in London's East End. He painted the British Home Secretary in 1920, Edward Shortt, the distinguished Indian/Jewish Sassoon family, and his uncle Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog. He often took many months to complete one painting; he made a poor living, particularly during the Second World War.\nHe moved to stained glass in 1935, following a commission to design a window in Leeds Synagogue commemorating the Jubilee of King George V. Thereafter, he designed full sets of windows in several London synagogues, including Gt Portland Street, St John's Wood, St Albans, Walm Lane (now installed at Brondesbury Park Synagogue and elsewhere), and the Hechal Shlomo centre in Jerusalem. David Hillman was also active in the Association of German Refugees and, after the Second World War, taught art for years at the Maccabi Association.\n\n\n== Family ==\nIn 1926, he married Annie Rabinowitz, also descended from a long line of rabbis. She was a general practitioner. David and Annie had three sons: Ellis Hillman, Harold Hillman and Mayer Hillman. Hillman's only sibling, Sarah, married Isaac Herzog, the first Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of the State of Israel and father of Chaim Herzog.\n\n\n== Death ==\nHillman died on 14 May 1974.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Negros Force was activated by USAFFE on September 1, 1941, to May 12, 1942. The force did not fought during the war but played in organizing units deployed to different sector. The force also continued to fight as a guerilla after the surrender. Although the two provinces was never united due to different affiliation of the commanders.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIt was organized after 71st Infantry Division was ordered transfer to Luzon. The only remaining combat unit remained in the island is the 73rd Infantry Regiment under Major Robert H. Vessey. USAFFE Headquarters ordered 61st Infantry Division to transfer 61st Infantry Regiment to Negros Island in October 1941 to take the defense of Negros Occidental. Having two infantry regiments in the Island seems formidable but the lack of weapons, ammunitions, no artillery pieces.\nTraining went ahead for both regiments when war in the Philippines commenced on December 8, 1941, where Clark Air Base and other military installations in Luzon was bombed. On January 4, 1942, Visayas-Mindanao Force commander Brigadier General William F. Sharp ordered both 73rd Infantry and 61st Infantry Regiments transfer to Mindanao Island via Iligan route. These regiments left for Mindanao on January 5, 1942. Only trainees and PC Companies for Negros Occidental and Negros Oriental province was left on the island.\nLieutenant Colonel Gabriel Gador of the Philippine Army commander of the 7th Military District assumed command and took action in organizing two infantry regiments 74th Provisional Infantry Regiment and 75th Provisional Infantry Regiments.\n\n\n== Order of battle, January 1942 ==\n74th Provisional Infantry Regiment – Major Sam Jones\n1st Battalion – Major Benjamin Roque\n2nd Battalion – Major Francisco Gomez\n3rd Battalion – Major Ernesto Mata\n75th Provisional Infantry Regiment – Lieutenant Colonel Tiburcio Ballesteros\n1st Battalion – 1Lieutenant Feliciano Señeres\n2nd Battalion – 1Lieutenant Antonio Romero\nNegros Occidental PC Company - Lieutenant Colonel Mantilla\nNegros Oriental PC Company – Lieutenant Colonel Balolong\n7th Military District – Major Salvador Abcede | Lieutenant Colonel Gabriel Gador\n\n\n=== Commanders ===\nWhen 71st Infantry Division the island has no single commander although Colonel Eugene Mitchell was the senior officers in the island he is only authorized to command 61st Infantry which covers Negros Occidental and Major Robert H. Vessey commanded 73rd Infantry which covers the southeast part of the island. Lieutenant Colonel Gabriel Gador assumed command when 73rd Infantry and 61st Infantry left for Mindanao, however he was ordered to move to Mindanao and VMF sent Colonel Roger Hilsman to command on February 8, 1942. Due to his failing help General Chynoweth ordered Hilsman to Cebu to become his Chief of Staff and avail medical services. Chynoweth ordered Colonel Carter McClennan from Panay to move to Negros to take command. A day after Hilsman moved to Cebu the Japanese invaded Cebu and after two days the command was lost. Hilsman crossed back to Negros to assume command. Colonel McClennan being the junior slid to being executive officer and by the time Visayan Force surrendered it was McClennan who acted as commander.\n\n\n=== Staff ===\nHilsman assembled his staffs for Negros Force, appointing Major Salvador Abcede as his S2 Intelligence Officer, Major Francisco Gomez as Operations G2.\n\n\n== President and vice president stop-over ==\nThe most important event that took place in the island was President and Vice President of the Philippine Commonwealth stop over in Negros island from Corregidor island. President Manuel Quezon aboard Princess of Negros docked in Pulupandan, Negros Occidental on March 14, 1942. Followed by Vice President Sergio Osmeña on March 15. The stopover created a fuzzed among commanders due to the safety of these dignitaries and their parties. Among them are Philippine Commonwealth Army Chief of Staff Major General Basilio Valdes and President's family. No one bothered to advise the president to leave the soonest to Mindanao as Japanese activities in Visayan waters has intensified not even the island commander Colonel Hilsman. In March 15, Brigadier General Bradford Chynoweth the newly appointed commander of newly created Visayan Force passed through to Negros to established headquarters in Cebu. Hilsman met him at Pulupandan port and brought the matter to Chynoweth on President's presence in the island what it brought immense worries. Chynoweth promised to message the president after reaching Cebu.\nIn March 16, just as Chynoweth off board from a ferry in Toledo, a cruiser appeared and shelled both Toledo, Cebu and San Carlos, Negros Oriental.  President's ship Princess of Negros was docked in San Carlos was captured by the Japanese. The incident gave a proof on the worries of Hilsman for the President and his party to leave the island the soonest for safety reason. Chynoweth sent a message from Cebu to Hilsman to be conveyed to the President to leave the island the soonest. This did not sit well with the President Quezon and went berserk on Chynoweth but the trip was already arranged with USFIP coordination.\nThe President and his party crossed to Mindanao using PT Boats of Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron 6 under Lieutenant Bulkeley. Due to the hastily arranged departure and limited space of PT Boat some of the luggage was left at the port in Dumaguete. The President and his party landed in Oroquieta, Misamis Occidental the following morning. This gave a relief for Colonel Hilsman and his troops to continue training and preparation.\n\n\n== Order of battle, February 1942 ==\n74th Provisional Infantry Regiment – Major Sam C. Jones\n1st Battalion – Major Angel Okol\n2nd Battalion – Major Francisco Gomez | Major Salvador Abcede\n3rd Battalion – Major Ernesto Mata\n75th Provisional Infantry Regiment – Major Roque\n1st Battalion – Major Pulong Arpa\n2nd Battalion – Major Benjamin Ignacio\nNegros Occidental PC - Lieutenant Colonel Mantilla, PC\nNegros Oriental PC – Lieutenant Colonel Balolong, PC\n7th Military District – Major Salvador Abcede | Lieutenant Colonel Gabriel Gador\nColonel Roger Hilsman arrived in the island on February 8, 1942, from VMF Headquarters to command. Hilsman commanded the Defense force in Davao City on mid-December 1941. He immediately reorganized the Negros Force, Lieutenant Colonel Gador was ordered to Mindanao by VMF, Major Salvador Abcede, PA took over command of 7th Military District.\n\n\n== Japanese invasion of Visayas ==\nOn April 9, 1942 Kawaguchi detachment left Lingayen Gulf for Cebu with 11 transports escorted by 3 destroyers and 2 Cruisers. On April 16, 1942 Kawamura detachment left Lingayen to secure the island of Panay. When Cebu island was secured 10th Independent Garrison took over as well as Panay for Kawamura and Kawaguchi detachments free for the island of Mindanao operations.\n\n\n=== Surrender ===\nThe Japanese commander in Cebu sent emissaries to Negros discuss surrender but Colonel Hilsman rejected. However, order to surrender received at the Negros Force headquarters from Visayas-Mindanao Force on May 12, 1942. All commanders were ordered to surrender along with his men but Major Salvador Abcede and Captain Ernesto Mata did not surrender.

        "content": "Volcano Blues is an album by pianist Randy Weston and Melba Liston, who arranged and conducted most of the music. It was recorded on February 5 and 6, 1993, at BMG Studios in New York City, and was released later that year by Antilles Records, Verve Records and Gitanes Jazz Productions. On the album, Weston and Liston are joined by saxophonists Talib Kibwe, Teddy Edwards, and Hamiet Bluiett, trumpeter Wallace Roney, trombonist Benny Powell, guitarist Ted Dunbar, double bassist Jamil Nasser, drummer Charlie Persip, and percussionists Obo Addy and Neil Clarke. Guitarist and vocalist Johnny Copeland also appears on two tracks.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nIn a review for AllMusic, Ron Wynn wrote: \"Liston's arrangements required disciplined solos, and Weston's steady hand generated impressive cohesion and interaction during the unison segments. A superb example of the African/African-American musical continuum.\"\nCritic Gary Giddins called the album \"blithely entertaining\" and \"a chameleonic celebration of the twelve-bar sonnet that provokes and amuses and deepens with every hearing.\"\nA reviewer for the Chicago Tribune noted \"the communicative appeal of this music,\" and stated: \"Volcano Blues will remind listeners that there's more to blues expression than the skeletal, four-chord pattern that has sold millions of pop records around the world. Complexly layered rhythms, a subtle sense of swing, intricate orchestration, melody evoking ancient Africa-all of these elements express the spirit of the blues, as this album attests.\"\nReuben Jackson of The Washington Post commented: \"Although a good deal has been written about the influence of the blues on jazz, few musicians associated with either genre have explored the countless rhythmic, melodic and textural possibilities inherent in the former as fearlessly and successfully as pianist Randy Weston.\" He praised the rendition of \"Harvard Blues\", in which Copeland's \"alternatively seductive and grainy voice describes the difficulty of juggling scholarship and romance, sentiments echoed by the cooing solo of trombonist Benny Powell.\"\nThe authors of The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings acknowledged the presence of \"a firm hand in the arranging department,\" and wrote: \"Liston takes control, rightly gaining a joint authorship credit... This is by no means a typical Weston record, and it's slightly difficult to locate vis-à-vis the rest. That shouldn't stop anyone sampling it. however.\"\nWriting for the Los Angeles Times, Richard Guilliatt described the album as \"a spiritual heir of sorts\" to Weston's 1991 release The Spirits of Our Ancestors, and remarked: \"Volcano Blues traces the bloodlines of the blues from Africa to the Caribbean, the Mississippi Delta, the Kansas City big bands of Count Basie and on to New York... he approaches the blues with a wide vision.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Blue Mood\" (Jessie Mae Robinson) – 2:42\n\"Chalabati Blues\" (Randy Weston) – 6:02\n\"Sad Beauty Blues\" (Randy Weston) – 3:18\n\"The Nafs\" (Randy Weston) – 2:33\n\"Volcano\" (Count Basie) – 2:25\n\"Harvard Blues\" (Count Basie, George Frazier, Tab Smith) – 4:09\n\"In Memory Of\" (Randy Weston) – 5:09\n\"Blues for Strayhorn\" (Randy Weston) – 3:46\n\"Penny Packer Blues\" (Randy Weston) – 4:12\n\"J.K.

To date, 29 non-redshift measurements yield a distance of 44.662 ± 5.536 Mpc (~146 million ly), which is within the Hubble distance range. Note that it is with the average value of independent measurements, when they exist, that the NASA/IPAC database calculates the diameter of a galaxy.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nThis galaxy was discovered in 1835 by the English astronomer John Herschel using a 47.5 cm (18.7 in) optical telescope that used a mirror as the light-gathering element.\n\n\n== Supernovae ==\nTwo supernovas have been observed in NGC 7329: SN 2006bh and SN 2009iu.\n\n\n=== SN 2006bh ===\nThis supernova was discovered on April 2, 2006, by South African amateur astronomer Berto Monard, in Pretoria.\n\n\n=== SN 2009iu ===\nThis supernova was discovered on September 1, 2009, by the CHASE (Chilean Automatic Supernova Search) project, a project searching for supernovae visible from astronomical observatories in the southern hemisphere.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of NGC objects (7001–7840)\nList of barred Magellanic spiral galaxies\n\n\n== External links ==\nNGC 7329 at NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database\nNGC 7329 at Simbad du Centre de données astronomiques de Strasbourg.\nNGC 7329 at LEDA\nNGC 7678 at SEDS\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Palazzo del Comune (Palace of the Commune or Municipality) is a monumental building located in Piazza Garibaldi forming part of the civic center of Parma, region of Emilia Romagna, Italy. The building houses municipal offices. Across the Piazza Garibaldi (and the busy intersections of Stradas Mazzini, della Republica, Cavour and Luigi Carlo Farini) are a number of other prominent buildings including the Palazzi del Podesta and del Governatore, and the neoclassical Church of San Pietro Apostolo.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe present late-Renaissance-style facade facing the piazza remains in unclad brick (typically the brick would have been covered by either stone or plaster. The present structure, with its tall open arcades, was designed starting in 1627 by Giovanni Battista Magnani, but only completed by 1673, without its external decoration.\nThe adjacent, and linked, crenallated Gothic-style Palazzo della Podesta (built 1221–1240) gives a sense of the style of the building erected originally at this site between 1281 and 1282. The prior palace (Palazzo del Capitano del Popolo) had a tall tower build behind the facade and housed the town jail (\"della Camusina\"). However, the tower suffered a catastrophic collapse on January 27, 1606, killing 26 persons.\nThe 17th-century reconstruction proceeded slowly, and the building was used for various civic, business, and military purposes. Over the centuries the structure it also acquired some commemorative decoration. In the 19th-century refurbishments were pursued by Girolamo Magnani and Sante Marco. In 1829, on the facade facing the nearby church of San Vitale, Paolo Toschi installed a fountain surmounted in the niche by a copy of the statuary group depicting Hercules and Anteus (1684–1687) sculpted by Teodoro Vandersturck originally for the Palazzo del Giardino and now displayed in the courtyard of the Palazzo Cusani. In 1870, the city, in an expression of civic pride, installed a monument to the painter Correggio, sculpted by Agostino Ferrarini. On the pilasters of the ground floor portico were a number of plaques, including one (1903) memorializing those fallen in the wars in the colonies of Libya, Somalia, and Ethiopia during the 19th century, completed by Alessandro Marzaroli. Another plaque honors Giuseppe Mazzini (1887) completed by Giovanni Chierici.\nInside, the Council Hall was frescoed by Girolamo Magnani and Cecrope Barilli in 1885–86. The building displays paintings by Annibale Carracci, Ilario Spolverini, and Gervasio and Bernardino Gatti.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nSome information derived from Italian Wikipedia entry.",

After the kidnapping of the Chief of Staff Jeong Seung-hwa, he automatically rose to the top position in the army chain of command and took in charge of the whole government forces. However, he was too indecisive to make a quick decision of summoning forces to quell the rebels. He was then easily deceived by the rebel leader Chun Doo-hwan that Yoon ordered a withdrawal of the government force, which gave rebels the opportunity to advance without resistance and eventually take control of the entire Seoul.\nUnlike most other generals on the government side, who were either demoted or discharged after the incident, Yoon's incompetence during the coup ironically won him favour of Chun Doo-hwan, who promoted him to become the commander of the I Corps.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nYoon later became the 23rd Minister of National Defence. After his retirement, he served as chairman of the board of directors of the Korea National Oil Development Corporation, chairman of the Korea Textile Association, standing advisor to Hyundai Precision Corporation, and a special member of the Alliance for Freedom and Democracy.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "SS Falaba was a British cargo liner. She was built in Scotland in 1906 and sunk by a U-boat in the North Atlantic in 1915. The sinking killed more than 100 people, provoking outrage in both the United Kingdom and United States.\nShe was the first of two Elder Dempster Lines ships that were named after the town of Falaba in Sierra Leone. The second was a motor ship that was built in 1962, sold and renamed in 1978, and scrapped in 1984.\n\n\n== Building and identification ==\nIn 1905 Elder, Dempster Shipping Ltd ordered  a pair of cargo and passenger liners from Alexander Stephen and Sons of Linthouse in Glasgow. Yard number 413 was launched on 23 May as Fulani, but then bought by Compagnie Maritime Belge and completed as Albertville. Yard number 414 was launched on 22 August as Falaba, and completed for Elder, Dempster as planned.Falaba's registered length was 300.5 ft (91.6 m), her beam was 47.4 ft (14.4 m) and her depth was 22.9 ft (7.0 m). Her tonnages were 4,806 GRT and 3,011 NRT. She had berths for 210 passengers: 138 in first class, and 72 in second class.Elder, Dempster registered Falaba in Liverpool. Her UK official number was 124000 and her code letters were HJGF. By 1911 she was equipped for wireless telegraphy, supplied and operated by the Marconi Company. By 1913 her call sign MZK.In 1911 Elder, Dempster bought Albertville and renamed her Elmina.\n\n\n== Loss and rescue ==\nOn the afternoon of 27 March 1915 Falaba left Liverpool for West Africa carrying 151 passengers and 95 crew. They included 30 British Army officers on their way to prepare for the Kamerun campaign, and 70 Colonial Service officers. Her cargo included 13 tons of cartridges and gunpowder.\nFalaba left the Mersey estuary just after the White Star Liner Cymric, and at 19:00 hrs the two ships dropped their pilots to the same cutter off Holyhead. The ships parted in the Irish Sea, as Cymric headed for Fastnet and Falaba made for Las Palmas.The next day Falaba sighted a submarine in St George's Channel 38 nautical miles (70 km) west of the Smalls Lighthouse. The submarine was flying the White Ensign, but as it closed on her, it replaced it with the ensign of the Imperial German Navy, and signalled \"Stop and abandon ship\". The submarine was U-28. Falaba's Master, Captain Frederick J Davis, ordered \"full ahead\", which increased her speed to 15 knots (28 km/h). Falaba also fired distress rockets. U-28 gave chase at 16 knots (30 km/h) for a quarter of an hour, and ordered \"Stop or I will fire\". Falaba hove to, and U-28 told her \"You have ten minutes\".Falaba's Chief Officer ordered the Marconi wireless operator to transmit a distress signal. It said \"Submarine alongside. Am putting off passengers in boats.\" Cymric was one of the ships that received the signal, and was no more than 15 nautical miles (28 km) away, but Admiralty standing orders forbade her to put herself at risk by going to assist. A few minutes later, Cymric's Marconi operator heard Royal Navy warships answering Falaba's signal.Falaba began abandoning ship. After 23 minutes, before she had launched all her lifeboats, smoke was sighted on the horizon. U-28 fired one torpedo from a range of only 100 yards, hitting Falaba's engine room, and causing her to sink within ten minutes at position 51°30′N 06°36′W. The explosion also capsized the first two lifeboats that had been launched, throwing many people into the water.One survivor said that about 50 people were standing on Falaba's poop when the torpedo struck, and he believed that all of them were killed. He said that he was with about 40 people in a lifeboat, but it was leaking badly, and within about 20 minutes it filled with water and capsized. Falaba's wireless operator described being in a lifeboat \"but almost as soon as it touched the water it began to sink, a part of the side having burst through\". A passenger with a piece of rope held the crack together as well as he could, but water poured in and soon we were up to our waists in water.\" He added that a member of the crew was washed away from the swamped lifeboat.111 people were killed, including Captain Davis. Some survivors, including the Second Engineer, alleged that about a dozen of U-28's crew were on deck, laughing at the victims, and making no effort to rescue anyone. The German government rejected such accusations as \"shameless lies\".One British passenger took photographs aboard Falaba while the passengers and crew were abandoning ship. The film in his camera survived, although he was in the water for an hour before being rescued. The Daily Mirror published his photographs.Two drifters, Eileen Emma and Wenlock, rescued survivors, and towed the lifeboats to safety. Eight people, including Captain Davis, died of hypothermia after being rescued. Survivors were landed in Milford Haven, Wales.\n\n\n== Thrasher incident ==\n\nThe victims included a US citizen, Leon Thrasher, from Massachusetts, who was a mechanical engineer travelling to Sekondi to work for a British mining company in Gold Coast (now Ghana). His death caused diplomatic tension between the United States and Germany that became known as the Thrasher incident.\n\n\n== Other consequences ==\nFalaba was unarmed. Shipmasters and their trade union, the Mercantile Marine Service Association, responded to her loss by calling for UK merchant ships to be defensively armed.At the end of March, Dr Bernhard Dernburg, a German former Colonial Minister who was living in the United States, said that Germany had given \"ample warning\" on 18 February that persons traveling on any British ship would be in danger. He called U-28's actions \"perfectly justifiable\", because Falaba did not heave to when ordered. A few days later, in an official message to the German Embassy in Washington, the German government also stressed that it had given due warning, and held the British government responsible for the loss of British vessels and neutral passengers.On 6 April a German statement that was described as a \"semi-official account\" criticised Falaba for spending 15 minutes speeding away from U-28 instead of heaving to, and pointed out that when Falaba did finally obey the order, U-28 did not fire its torpedo until after 23 minutes, and then only because of the approach of vessels, which it feared were Allied warships. The German statement reasoned that Falaba's officers and men should have used the 15 minutes of the chase to prepare her lifeboats for launching. It alleged that when they did launch her lifeboats, it was \"in an unseamanlike manner\", and that \"They failed to give assistance, which was possible, to passengers struggling in the water.\"A German communiqué drafted at the end of May 1915 complained that the UK had advised its merchant ships to disguise themselves by flying the flag of a neutral country, and to try to ram enemy submarines. U-boats were therefore entitled to torpedo merchant ships in self-defence.\n\n\n== Inquiry ==\nOn 20 May 1915 an official inquiry by the Board of Marine Arbitration was opened in London. John Bigham, 1st Viscount Mersey, President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division of the High Court, presided. The Solicitor General for England and Wales, Stanley Buckmaster, represented the Board of Trade.Some survivors told the inquiry that the lifeboats were \"rotten\", and that some of them were damaged when being launched. Counsel for Elder, Dempster denied that the boats were unseaworthy.When the inquiry concluded on 8 July, Lord Mersey said he was satisfied that those witnesses were \"mistaken\", and the damage was not due to neglect by Falaba's officers or crew. He declared that \"The cargo was an ordinary one\", and he dismissed the presence of 13 tons of cartridges and gunpowder as \"no more than is usually carried in peace time\". He found the officers and men of U-28 \"exclusively\" responsible for the loss of life.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBigham, John (1915). Loss of the Steamship \"Falaba\".

        "content": "Mystery at Lynden Sands is a 1928 detective novel by the British author Alfred Walter Stewart, published under his pseudonym J.J. Connington.  It is the third in a series of novels featuring the Golden Age Detective Chief Constable Sir Clinton Driffield. It was published in London by Gollancz and Boston by Little, Brown and Company. It received a generally positive critical reception, with one reviewer going so far as to say it \"may just fail of being the best detective story of the century\" comparing it to The Cask and The Mysterious Affair at Styles. In A Catalogue of Crime by Jacques Barzun and Wendell Hertig Taylor describe it as \"early but not first-class Connington\".\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nWhile holidaying at a new hotel at the coastal resort of Lynden Sands with his friend Westover, Chief Constable Sir Clinton Driffield is drawn into a murder case revolving around the large Fordingbridge inheritance including a country estate near to Lynden Sands. Two subsequent murders on the beach of Lynden Sands itself require all Sir Clinton's skills as a puzzle-solving detective to piece together the various clues and sandy footprints collected between the rising and falling tides.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBarzun, Jacques & Taylor, Wendell Hertig.

        "content": "The Consulate General of Sweden, Montreal was the diplomatic mission of Sweden in Montreal between 1916 and 1993. The consulate general originated from the consulate opened in 1906, which was converted into a consulate general in 1916. The consulate general tasks was to advance the interests of Sweden, and to serve and protect Swedes in Montreal and in different provinces and territories of Canada. Along with those in Chicago, Houston, Minneapolis, New York City, and San Francisco, the consulate general belonged to the so-called \"heritage consulates\" due to the large number of inheritance cases it handled.\nThe consulate general's district comprised the whole of Canada until 1983. Between 1983 and 1991, divisions of the district occurred between the Swedish consulate general in Montreal, the consulate general in Toronto, and the consulate in Vancouver. From 1991 until its closure in 1993, the district consisted of Montreal and Quebec, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. The consulate general in Montreal closed in 1993, and since then, a Swedish honorary consulate has been operating in the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Consulate ===\nThe consulate was established by decision on 26 October 1906, with a district covering British North America excluding British Columbia. By decision of the Riksdag of 1912, a salary from an additional allocation for the consul in Montreal was established, and the Riksdag of 1913 approved King in Council's proposition regarding the establishment of this consulate on regular terms (salary 19,000 kronor). In this context, the consul was also given precedence over the consul in Victoria, British Columbia, so that the former's district would henceforth encompass all of Canada (including British Columbia). In December 1915, the King in Council appointed and commissioned the former Cabinet Minister, Consul General in availability, Ph.D. David Bergström, as consul in Montreal from 1 January 1916, and also appointed Consul General Bergström to be Consul General in British North America. In December 1915, the King in Council appointed and commissioned former cabinet minister Dr. David Bergström as Consul in Montreal, effective 1 January 1916, and concurrently appointed Consul Bergström to serve as Consul General in British North America.\n\n\n=== Consulate general ===\nIn the beginning of 1916, the Committee of Supply approved the King in Council's proposal to replace the consulate in Montreal with a consulate general, and an annual salary of 26,000 kronor. Fredrik Vilhelm Thorsson and August Sävström, among others, opposed this and proposed rejection. In the first chamber, Mr. Lindblad from Gothenburg opposed the proposal and reminded that the consulate in Montreal had been built with regular state funds in 1913. Even though the consulate had received more work due to increased emigration to Canada, it was not considered necessary to elevate it to a consulate general, especially just before the Riksdag was to convene. Herman Kvarnzelius from the committee assured that they had thoroughly investigated the matter and found that a consulate general in Montreal was justified, considering its extensive workload and the importance of promoting trade and industry. However, Thorsson argued that Sweden's interests would be better served with an additional consulate in Canada and deemed it premature to increase expenditures for consular purposes in Montreal, especially considering the increase that had already occurred from 19,000 to 37,000 SEK. Foreign Minister Knut Agathon Wallenberg explained the need for a consulate in Montreal and emphasized the country's significance for trade relations. He believed that the proposed salary was necessary to ensure a competent representative in Canada. He also defended the proposal to elevate the consulate to a consulate general citing its increased influence and capacity to do more than a regular consulate. Despite objections from several members, the chamber eventually approved the committee's proposal. On 29 February 1916, the Foreign Office in London approved of David Bergström as Consul of Sweden at Montreal for British North America with the exception of British Columbia, and Consul-General for British North America.\nIn the 1943 American Investigation (Amerikautredningen), a preliminary report aimed to strengthen and streamline Swedish diplomatic representation and information activities in North and South America. Considering Canada's growing importance, they proposed that the existing consulate general in Montreal was inadequate and that a diplomatic mission should be established in Ottawa. It was suggested that the envoy would also serve as consul general in Montreal. To support this representation, the King in Council's proposition to the Riksdag suggested placing two mid-level officials at the mission, one to handle commercial matters and the other for general affairs, especially probate matters. Despite the need for expanded consular representation, experts did not propose establishing new consulates in Canada at present, but they suggested that the proposed trade attaché in San Francisco should also focus on Swedish interests on the Canadian West Coast. Since Canada's political and commercial significance had increased significantly, it was proposed that Swedish representation in the country should have a diplomatic character. They noted that many non-British countries had already established missions in Ottawa, and they also highlighted the significant Swedish population in Canada as further justification for strengthening Swedish representation. To bolster the staff, they proposed appointing a higher-ranking legation secretary. In August 1943, the Swedish government decided to establish a mission in Ottawa and close the consulate general in Montreal. Per Wijkman, the consul general in Montreal, was appointed as envoy to Ottawa.\nIn 1949, a legation office was established in Montreal under the jurisdiction of the legation in Ottawa. The chancery lasted until 1953, when the consulate general was re-established.\n\n\n=== Closure ===\nIn December 1992, it was announced that a number of Swedish embassies and consulates would be closed. The decision was to be made as part of the state budget presented on 11 January 1993. For Canada, this meant that the consulate general in Montreal (with two Ministry for Foreign Affairs employees) and in Toronto (with three diplomatic staff) would be closed. During the budget year 1993/94, the consulate general in Montreal, like many other public sectors, faced extensive cost-cutting measures and rationalizations. Achieving a smaller but more efficient administration required not only general thriftiness but also structural changes. In order to reduce costs and improve efficiency, the Swedish government proposed replacing ten diplomatic missions with alternative representations starting from 1 July 1993, including the consulate general in Montreal, which would be converted into an honorary consulate or consulate general. These measures aimed to reduce costs by replacing career consulates and embassies with cheaper alternatives while simultaneously enhancing coordination between the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Stockholm and its diplomatic missions with fixed representation.\n\n\n== Tasks ==\nThe consulate, along with those in Chicago, Houston, Minneapolis, New York City, and San Francisco, belonged to the so-called heritage consulates due to the large number of inheritance cases the consulate handled. Legal advisors were attached to them, and they handled, among other things, inheritance cases.\nDuring the tenure of the consulate general, there were subordinate consulates: Calgary, Chatham, Dawson City, Edmonton, Hamilton, Halifax, Kenora, Newcastle, Newfoundland, Port Arthur, Quebec City, Saint John, Sydney, Toronto, Vancouver, Victoria, and Winnipeg.\n\n\n== Area of responsibility ==\nThe consulate's district until 1983 encompassed the whole of Canada. In 1983, the Swedish consulate in Vancouver opened, and from the following year, the consulate took over the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan, as well as the territory of Yukon, from the consulate general in Montreal. From 1985 to 1990, the district of the consulate general consisted of Montreal, as well as the provinces and territories of Quebec, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, and the Northwest Territories. From 1991 to 1993, the district consisted of Montreal, Quebec, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. In 1991, the Swedish consulate general in Toronto opened, taking over responsibility for Ontario, Manitoba, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and the Northwest Territories.\n\n\n== Buildings ==\n\n\n=== Chancery ===\nFrom at least 1914 to 1915, the chancery was located in the Canadian Express Building at 95 McGill Street, Room 516–517. From 1916 to 1929, the chancery was located in the Drummond Building at 511 Saint Catherine Street West in Downtown Montreal. From 1930 to 1937, the chancery was located at 1117 Saint Catherine Street West in Downtown Montreal. From 1938 to 1943, the chancery was located at 1462 Bishop Street West in Downtown Montreal. At the same address, the embassy office was located in 1949.\nFrom 1950 to 1953, the embassy office was located at Bishop Court Apartments on 1511 Bishop Street. Subsequently, the consulate general's chancery was located at the same address from 1954 to 1959. From 1960 to April 1962, the chancery was located at 2055 Bishop Street. On 1 May 1962, it moved to the newly built CIBC Tower, Suite 800, 1155 Dorchester Boulevard West (renamed René Lévesque Boulevard in 1987) in Downtown Montreal. It remained here for over 30 years until the consulate general closed in 1993.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Residence ===\nFrom at least 1965 to 1966, the consul general's residence was located at 3460 Simpson Street in the Golden Square Mile neighborhood. From 1966 onward, the residence was located at 2801 Hill Park Circle next to Beaver Lake on Mount Royal.\n\n\n== Heads of Mission ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nEmbassy of Sweden, Ottawa\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nInfo on the Honorary Consulate of Sweden, Montreal",

Until 2012, \"Mass Media Group\" was owned by the Cypriot company \"RBC Investments (Cyprus) Limited\", owned by Russian businessman Herman Kaplun. Kaplun remained the manager of its bank accounts in the Russian Federation. As of 2024, the company \"Mass Media Group\" is owned by THORNLEY INVESTMENTS LTD, which is listed among the companies affiliated with the Russian holding RBC.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJoseph (Iosif) Pintus was born in Ufa (Bashkir ASSR). He graduated from high school No. 11 in Mykolaiv. In 2003, he graduated from the law faculty of the National Academy of Management in Kyiv.\nThat same year, he started his business: the hosting company \"Ukrainian Business Technologies\". The money received from the hosting provider was decided to be invested in the banner business, popular at that time in Ukraine. Therefore, in 2004, he launched the banner network \"MBN\" (Master Banner Network). It included exclusively online media, and the main condition for cooperation was the placement of the banner in the most advantageous place. Thus, the overall high CTR of the network was achieved, and it was beneficial for information platforms to exchange such advertising. By the early 2000s, MBN becomes one of the most popular advertising networks in Ukraine.\nIn 2006, Yosyp Pintus and Volodymyr Shultz, together with \"RosBusinessConsulting\" (\"RBC\"), founded the Ukrainian information agency \"RBC-Ukraine\", which as of February 2020 is the most visited among Ukrainian online publications, according to data from the international online research agency Gemius.\nIn 2008, he opened the commodity-news media platform \"Traffim\", which by 2019 was among the three largest traffic networks in Ukraine. That same year, Pintus left the founders of \"MBN\", and in 2019 left the owners of the \"Traffim\" platform, focusing the main attention on the development of the information agency.\nPintus is the only media businessman among the owners of the five most popular Ukrainian online media, which mostly belong to either oligarchs or officials.\n\n\n== RBC-Ukraine ==\nAccording to Pintus, \"RBC-Ukraine\" was historically an information agency. Even in 2010, Pintus claimed that there was nothing in common between \"RBC-Ukraine\" and the Russian \"RBC\" except for the brand. This was indirectly confirmed by the absence of mentions of the Ukrainian agency in the annual report of the Russian RBC for 2010.\nFrom April 2015, the founder of the information agency \"RBC-Ukraine\" (certificate No. 402—264 PR from 4 June 2015) becomes the company \"UBT\". The trade mark \"RBC\" (certificate No. 58683 from 11 October 2005) in Ukraine belongs to the company \"RBC-Media\". The director of both companies is Pintus.\nThe project quickly found its niche in the Ukrainian media market and continues to dynamically develop its audience. Moreover, in 2012, \"RBC-Ukraine\" received an award in the nomination \"Internet Media of the Year\" according to the \"Person of the Year\" program.\nIn 2014, the agency officially separated from its Russian partner, which soon led to its being blocked in the territory of the Russian Federation for \"extremist materials\". Journalists of the publication assumed that the formal reason for the blocking was an article titled \"Putin died\" (Russian: Путин умер), which appeared on the subsidiary project \"Styler\".\n\nIn 2015, Pintus explained the success of \"RBC-Ukraine\" as follows:Today, it is impossible to be sluggish, heavy. In the internet, the relevance of an event can disappear in 4 seconds. The competition for the primary source is huge. You need lightning-fast reaction, otherwise, the information will appear everywhere — and there will be no sense in posting it. We provide information, and the reader decides. We cannot publish any conclusions in the news, assert anything. For this, there is the author's column. Or author's articles.According to him, the core audience of \"RBC-Ukraine\" are top managers, middle managers, officials. Specifically for mass marketing, the \"Styler\" section was created.\nAs of the beginning of 2020, \"RBC-Ukraine\" topped the ranking of the most visited Ukrainian internet publications, according to data from the international online research agency Gemius.\n\n\n== Companies accused of money laundering ==\nAs of 2024, Pintus is the director and co-owner of the LLC \"UBT Media\", a company that manages an information resource. He also remains the director of LLC \"RBC-UKRAINE\", a company that was the operator of the site rbc.ua until 2015 and is owned by LLC \"Mass Media Group\". Until 2012, \"Mass Media Group\" was owned by the Cypriot company \"RBC Investments (Cyprus) Limited\", owned by German Kaplun. Kaplun remained in charge of its bank accounts in Russia. The Cypriot company was closed in 2015. As of 2024, \"Mass Media Group\" is owned by THORNLEY INVESTMENTS LTD, which is listed among companies affiliated with the Russian holding RBC. Until 2014, the owner of \"RBC-Ukraine\" was an offshore company from the British Virgin Islands, NewMediaHosting Inc, the owner of which is the Cyprus-registered company RBC Investments Limited, which also owns RBC. Thus, in the activities of Yosyp Pintus and German Kaplun, there are signs of laundering Russian money, including those received from state Kremlin customers, including those directly related to the Russian special services and the military-industrial complex.\n\n\n== Family ==\nPintus has two children. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Flávio Portela Marcílio (12 August 1917 — 26 January 1992) was a Brazilian lawyer, teacher and politician. Governor of Ceará from 1958 to 1959, he was president of the Chamber of Deputies on three occasions and was the vice president candidate on the ticket representing the Brazilian military regime with Paulo Maluf as president in the 1985 Brazilian presidential election, but were defeated by Tancredo Neves and José Sarney.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nSon of Francisco Carlos Marcílio and Celecina Portela. Bachelor of Legal and Social Sciences, foi professor da Federal University of Ceará, University of Brasília and the Centro Universitário de Brasília. Resident in Ceará since his youth, he was a lawyer, judge of the Regional Electoral Court and advisor to the Court of Auditors of Ceará, positions he left in 1954 when he began his political career for the Brazilian Labour Party (PTB).\nElected vice-governor of Ceará on the ticket of Paulo Sarasate in 1954, he took office as governor on 3 July 1958 when Sarasate resigned to run for federal deputy, and remained in office until 25 March 1959. Elected substitute federal deputy in 1962, he served under a summons. Appointed president of the Institute of Retirements and Pensions for Stevedores and Cargo Transport (IAPETEC) in 1963, he was appointed deputy on 11 April 1964 after the removal from office of Adalil Barreto by the Institutional Act Number One issued by the military regime. With the arrival of enforced bipartisanship via the Institutional Act Number Two, he joined National Renewal Alliance (ARENA) and was successively re-elected in 1966, 1970, 1974, 1978 and 1982.\nPresident of the Chamber of Deputies on three occasions (1973–1975, 1979–1981, 1983–1985), he experienced the beginning of political opening in the presidency of Ernesto Geisel, and in the presidency of João Figueiredo saw the return to a multi-party system, and Marcílio led the vote that rejected the Dante de Oliveira Constitutional Amendment aimed to reinstate direct elections for president. On 11 August 1984 he was chosen as candidate for vice president on the ticket of Paulo Maluf by the Democratic Social Party (PDS) national convention, but this ticket was defeated in the 1985 presidential election by Tancredo Neves and José Sarney. In 1986 he ran for a new term as federal deputy but was left as a substitute, however his family was represented in the Brazilian Constituent Assembly that drafted the Constitution of 1988 by his niece, Moema São Thiago.\nMarcílio assumed his last term as federal deputy on 23 May 1990, days after the resignation of Luís Marques, who was appointed general director of the National Department of Works Against Droughts (DNOCS) by president Fernando Collor.\nHe was the only native of Piauí to preside over the Chamber of Deputies and also the only one born in the state to compose a presidential ticket; Franklin Dória, born on Ilha dos Frades, Bahia, was the only representative of Piauí to preside the Chamber of Deputies.\nIn the 1990 elections, he contested his last election for the Chamber of Deputies, for the PDS. However, he was unsuccessful and was left as third substitute in his coalition, behind César Cals Neto.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiografia Flávio Portela Marcílio - Câmara dos Deputados\nBiografia Flávio Portela Marcílio - ALERJ",

Incumbent Governor Vladimir Vladimirov is eligible to run to a third term in office.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThen-First Deputy Governor of Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug Vladimir Vladimirov was appointed acting Governor of Stavropol Krai in September 2013, replacing Valery Zerenkov, who resigned just a little over a year in office. Vladimirov easily won the election for a full term in September 2014 against three opponents with 84.22% of the vote. Vladimirov ran for a second full term in 2019 and won again with 79.65%.\nInitially the Governor of Stavropol was limited for just two consecutive terms so Vladimirov would have been term-limited in 2024. However, in December 2021 \"On Common Principles of Organisation of Public Authority in the Subjects of the Russian Federation\" law was enacted, which lifted term limits for Russian governors. Stavropol Krai followed suit and lifted the restrictions, which allowed Vladimirov to seek another term in 2024.\n\n\n== Candidates ==\nIn Stavropol Krai candidates for Governor can be nominated only by registered political parties. Candidate for Governor of Stavropol Krai should be a Russian citizen and at least 30 years old. Candidates for Governor should not have a foreign citizenship or residence permit. Each candidate in order to be registered is required to collect at least 6% of signatures of members and heads of municipalities. Also gubernatorial candidates present 3 candidacies to the Federation Council and election winner later appoints one of the presented candidates.\n\n\n=== Publicly expressed interest ===\nVladimir Vladimirov (United Russia), incumbent Governor of Stavropol Krai (2013–present)\n\n\n== See also ==\n2024 Russian regional elections\n\n\n== References ==",

Hospitals and other infrastructure began switching to generator power where possible.\n\n\n=== Strike on the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station ===\nAccording to Ukrhydroenergo, missiles hit hydraulic structures of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, causing a fire at the station. Authorities said there was no risk of a breach on the dam’s structure. A Russian missile also hit a trolleybus that was traveling along the dam, according to Petro Andryushchenko, adviser to the legitimate mayor of Mariupol, adding that it was carrying civilians on their way to work. Traffic in the area of the dam was stopped.\nCEO of Ukrhydroenergo Ihor Syrota said on Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that the Russian military hit the dam’s two stations. According to him, the HPP-2 station was severely damaged, and it is unknown whether it will be possible to restore it. One of the station's supports was also hit and the crane beams were broken.\n\n\n=== Sumy Oblast ===\nIn Sumy Oblast, as a result of attacks on energy system facilities, emergency shutdown schedules were carried out in areas of Sumy, Konotop and Shostka Raions.\n\n\n=== Khmelnytskyi ===\n\nIn Khmelnytskyi, the strike damaged infrastructure and residential buildings, according to the mayor of the city, Oleksandr Symсhyshyn.

        "content": "The Ministry of Interior building (Arabic: مبنى وزارة الداخلية) is a 55-meter high six-story government building in the al-Olaya district of Riyadh that houses the main headquarters of the Ministry of Interior of Saudi Arabia. The building is a popular landmark in the city and is known for its inverted truncated square pyramid design surmounted by a dome, earning it nicknames like the Flying Saucer and the Spaceship by Western visitors. Designed by Archisystems and architects Musalli, Shakir and Mandill, it was constructed between 1980 and 1989 by Hyundai E&C.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe exterior design of the building was completed in 1980 by a Canada-based firm. It was commissioned when Prince Nayef bin Abdulaziz was the country's interior minister.\nIn the May 1987 edition of the Gulf Construction magazine, it documented the progress of construction of the building. The magazine described the building under-construction in its \"unclad skeletal state.\" Steelwork erection work started in December 1985.  Major construction works were completed by 1989, and the ministry completely shifted its offices to the precincts in 1992.\nThe interior of the dome surmounted over the inverted truncated square-shaped pyramid was manufactured by Zahner in the period 1988–1990.\nThe building annually gets illuminated in green color, the color of the country's national flag, during the celebrations of public holidays like Saudi National Day and Saudi Founding Day.\n\n\n== References ==",

Founded in 2006 as a division of the Russian media holding RBC Group (abbreviation for \"RosBusinessConsulting\"), but in 2010, the agency \"RBC-Ukraine\" left the composition of the Russian holding, and in 2015, it completely came under the control of Ukrainian media businessman Yosyp Pintus. On January 29, 2016, the Russian holding \"RBC\" tried to challenge the use of the \"RBC\" brand in court, but lost the case.\nSince April 2014, IA \"RBC-Ukraine\" positions itself as an independent company that has no relation to the Russian structure. From August 1, 2016, to June 2017, RBC-Ukraine was managed by Valeriy Kalnysh, the former chief editor of \"Radio Vesti\" and the magazine \"Kommersant-Ukraine\". Since July 2017, the chief editor has been Serhiy Shcherbyna.\n\n\n== Company overview ==\nRBC-Ukraine is a Ukrainian information portal specializing in financial, economic, and political news of Ukraine and the world. \"RBC-Ukraine\" was created in 2006 as the Ukrainian division of the Russian information agency RosBusinessConsulting (RBC).\nThe owner of the Ukrainian unit is Yosyp Pintus, a cousin of RosBusinessConsulting beneficiary Herman Kaplun.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the first months of 2006, only the Russian version of the site existed, but in the second half of 2006, a full-fledged Ukrainian version was launched. Among the main platforms included in the portal are the informational-analytical website \"RBC-Ukraine\", the online publication Worldnewsage.com (formerly Utro.ua), the informational-entertainment site \"Styler\" (news about culture, fashion, health, technology, and cars) and the English-language publication NewsUkraine.rbc.ua. From 2006 to 2008, the media director was journalist and media manager Roman Skrypin. In September 2016, the site was updated. In particular, the \"Daily\" module was added, which allows viewing the news feed without switching between pages (\"infinite scrolling\"). The updated site was divided into News, Daily, and Styler. In 2018, the \"Lite\" section was created on the site, specializing in news about celebrities, beauty, and fashion.\n\n\n== Ownership ==\nInitially, the agency \"RBC-Ukraine\" was owned by the Russian company \"RosBusinessConsulting\" through LLC \"RBC-Ukraine\". In April 2015, the official website of the Ukrainian agency partially removed the information that the \"agency was created with the support of the RBC group of companies\". In July 2016, the information was completely removed. In April 2014, it was announced that the agency had separated from the Russian RBC and has since been legally independent. As of April 2015, the founder of the information agency \"RBC-Ukraine\" (certificate No. 402—264 PR from 06.04.2015) became the Ukrainian company \"UBT\", owned by Yosyp Pintus who was involved in the creation of the agency \"RBC-Ukraine\" from the very beginning. Since 2015, LLC \"RBC-Ukraine\" has no relation to the agency. In 2015, employees of the SBU demanded a copy of the registration of the agency \"RBC-Ukraine\" in Ukraine, as in February of that year, the VRU adopted resolution No. 1853 on the temporary suspension of accreditation of journalists and technical workers of some Russian media at the bodies of state power in Ukraine. Most major Ukrainian online media are owned by oligarchs and, in one way or another, reflect the necessary point of view. RBC-Ukraine is the only one of the five most popular Ukrainian online media owned by a media businessman — Yosyp Pintus.\n\n\n== Money Laundering ==\nThe management of the information resource rbc.ua is carried out by LLC \"UBT Media\", the owners of which are Yosyp Pintus and Volodymyr Shultz. Pintus also remains the director of LLC \"RBC-UKRAINE\", a company that was the operator of the site rbc.ua until 2015 and whose owner is the company LLC \"Mas Media Group\". Until 2012, \"Mas Media Group\" was owned by the Cypriot company \"RBC Investments (Cyprus) Limited\", the owner of which was Herman Kaplun. Kaplun remained the manager of its bank accounts in the Russian Federation. The Cypriot company was closed in 2015.\nAs of 2024, the company \"Mas Media Group\" is owned by THORNLEY INVESTMENTS LTD, which is listed among companies affiliated with the Russian holding RBC. Until 2014, the owner of \"RBC-Ukraine\" was the offshore company from the BVI NewMediaHosting Inc, the owner of which is the Cyprus-registered company RBC Investments Limited and which also owns RBC.  Thus, in the activities of Herman Kaplun and his cousin and partner Yosyp Pintus, there are signs of laundering not just Russian money, but Russian money obtained from state Kremlin customers, including those directly related to the Russian special services and military-industrial complex.\n\n\n== Ratings ==\n\n\n=== Attendance ===\nAccording to the service Socialbakers, the information portal \"RBC-Ukraine\" in February 2020 ranked first in the number of subscribers on Facebook with an audience of 1.75 million readers. the Ukrainian-language — almost 440 thousand readers. The Styler division had 883 thousand subscribers, in total \"RBC-Ukraine\" has an audience of over 3 million readers in social networks, ranking first in the rating of Ukrainian social media by the number of subscribers.\nSince the beginning of 2020, the RBC-Ukraine site has ranked first in terms of visits among Ukrainian media.\n\n\n=== Quality ===\nIn September 2020, VOXUkraine analyzed 14,000 news stories from 26 major Ukrainian internet media. Materials from the sites of RBC-Ukraine and Interfax-Ukraine were recognized as the most cited among other media.\nAccording to a study by the IMI in March 2021, 92% of the publication's materials did not violate professional standards. The resource was found to contain materials with signs of commissioned content with possible violations of balance, but no violations of the standard of accuracy and separation of facts from comments were found.\nIn December 2020, the Commission on Journalistic Ethics assessed materials from RBC-Ukraine from November 30 and December 10 regarding the quality of transportation by the operator Join UP. According to the commission, standards of information objectivity, balance of viewpoints, and separation of judgments and assumptions were violated. The publication stated its readiness to publish the company's position, but the operator did not provide such data. The commission recognized the readiness to publish all opinions as appropriate for achieving balance.\n\n\n== Divisions ==\nAfter the site update in September 2016, the main sections of the site are:\n\n\"News\" — a news feed about Ukraine (in Ukrainian or Russian)\n\"Daily\" — a continuous news feed about Ukraine (in Ukrainian or Russian)\n\"Styler\"  — news in the sphere of society, culture, health, technology, and cars related to Ukraine. The section was created in 2015 as a Russian-language informational and entertainment site, and after updates in September 2016, a Ukrainian-language interface also appeared. (in Ukrainian or Russian)\n\"Lite\"  — news about celebrities, beauty, and fashion.\n\"Market Research\" (English: RBC-Ukraine \"Market Research\") — marketing research of the Ukrainian markets (in Russian)\n\"Travel\" — a project dedicated to travel and leisure. The main focus is on how to organize your vacation comfortably, affordably, and safely.\n\"Realty\" — a project dedicated to the real estate market in Ukraine and the world. The project's goal is to promote the development of the real estate market in Ukraine, with a primary focus in publications on how to choose reliable and comfortable housing, as well as how to invest profitably in the real estate market.\n\n\n== Management ==\nCEO: Yosyp Pintus.\nDeputy Directors: Volodymyr Shultz, Svitlana Sheremetyeva-Turchyn.\nCommercial Director: Dmytro Protsenko\n\n\n== Editorial ==\nEditor-in-Chief: Rostyslav Shapravskyi (since 2022), who previously worked as the first deputy editor-in-chief.\nPrevious editors-in-chief included:\n\nDanylo Kyryakov (2006–2009)\nAnton Pidlutskyi (2009–2015)\nDenys Bezliudko (2015–2016)\nValeriy Kalnysh (2016–2017)\nSerhiy Shcherbyna (from August 2017 to 2022).\nFrom 2006 to 2008, the media director of \"RBC-Ukraine\" was Roman Skrypin. In August, by mutual agreement, he left the company, and according to the CEO of \"RBC-Ukraine\" Yosyp Pintus, the position of media director was eliminated.\n\n\n== Blocking in Russia ==\nOn January 29, 2016, the Russian Roskomnadzor blocked the RBC-Ukraine site in the territory of the Russian Federation for \"extremist materials,\" commenting it as: \"with Bandera supporters, we have a short conversation\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Her Mystery Not of High Heels and Eye Shadow is an album by the American musician Jonathan Richman, released in 2001. It was his third album for Vapor Records. Richman supported the album with a North American tour.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe album was produced by Niko Bolas and Richman; Richman felt that some of his previous albums had been overproduced. Richman was again backed by stand-up drummer Tommy Larkins. Ralph Carney contributed on woodwinds. \"Vampiresa Mujer\" is a remake of Richman's \"Vampire Girl\". \"Give Paris One More Chance\" is a new version of a song Richman recorded for Jonathan Sings! \"Leaves on the Sidewalk After the Rain\" and \"Maybe a Walk Home from Natick High\" are instrumentals. \"Springtime in New York\" describes walking through Tompkins Square Park.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe New York Times wrote that \"rock's mooniest troubadour veils his wit in a cloud of romantic simplicity.\" Pitchfork noted that \"albums this unpretentious are increasingly rare ... that's what makes Her Mystery Not of High Heels and Eye Shadow so seductive.\" The Hartford Courant called Richman \"so forthright and free of irony that he may be mistaken as a children's performer, he is nonetheless full of unique adult insights.\"\nThe Orlando Sentinel praised \"My Love for Her Ain't Sad\", writing that \"the open harmonies in the gut-string guitar solo fall somewhere in the rich middle ground between country, folk and rock.\" The Washington Post concluded that \"Richman can seem a little too stuck in (or on) his own past... Yet there's always the fresh amour of songs like 'Me and Her Got a Good Thing Goin' Baby' to reinvigorate his sorta folky, sorta old-timey rock-and-roll.\" The Gazette said that \"the disc has a rough, deliciously sloppy garage-band feel to it.\"\nAllMusic stated that \"the title track is pure magic; its moonstruck words and gently swinging sound, even its cumbersome title, posit an alternative universe in which rock & roll only became more innocent and naïve after the '50s.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Record RS is a Brazilian television station based in Porto Alegre, capital of the state of Rio Grande do Sul. It operates on channel 2 (21 digital UHF), and is an owned-and-operated station of Record, belonging to the Record Group, which also controls its sister station Rádio Guaíba and the newspaper Correio do Povo. Its studios are located in Santa Tereza, and its transmission antenna is at the top of Morro da Polícia.\n\n\n== History ==\nTV Guaíba was founded on March 10, 1979, by Breno Caldas, son of journalist Caldas Júnior, the founder of the newspaper Correio do Povo. The channel's first broadcast was at 9pm, with the broadcast of the Rainha das Piscinas beauty contest, live from Ginásio Gigantinho. Without any type of affiliation with other national networks, TV Guaíba stood out in regional programs focusing on journalism, sport, cuisine, variety and culture. Films and series also occupied a large part of the programming, mainly Paramount productions distributed by Network Distribuidora de Filmes, as well as international documentaries distributed by the German Transtel (today incorporated by Deutsche Welle).\nIn the station's first phase, channel 2 broadcast its programming from 5:30 pm, when it began its daily schedule with an educational program produced by TVE Brasil in Rio de Janeiro, followed by an American series. From 7:30 pm onwards, Guaíba Ao Vivo was shown, following the model of programs shown locally at lunchtime, with comment boards, news, sports and varieties (such as the pioneer Diário de Notícias, from TV Piratini, Jornal do Almoço, from TV Gaúcha and Portovisão, from TV Difusora). Guaíba Ao Vivo took advantage of the team of communicators from Rádio Guaíba and the newspaper Correio do Povo, such as Rogério Mendelski, Adroaldo Streck, João Carlos Belmonte, Edegar Schmidt, Sérgio Jockymann, Carrion Júnior, as well as Ivette Brandalise, José Fontela, Sérgio Schueller, Gustavo Motta and Paulo Nilson. Actress Suzana Saldanha presented the first section of the program, with interviews and subjects of feminine or cultural interest, but lost her job when the network entered its second phase, on March 31, 1981. On Saturdays, the TV2 Pop Show was shown. , with Cascalho Contursi, aimed at young audiences. The program's intro was reused from a homonymous program by TV Cultura in São Paulo, which also had some of its identification vignettes recycled by Guaíba.\nWhen competitor TV Difusora was purchased by Rede Bandeirantes, most of the local programming was eliminated. As a result, Guaíba, which had hired Sérgio Reis (who had opened TV Piratini in the 1950s), brought the big names from channel 10 and started broadcasting from 10:30 am. The first local program to go on air in the new phase was Guaíba Feminina, presented from Monday to Friday from 11:30 am to 2:30 pm, presented by Tânia Carvalho, Magda Beatriz, Liliana Reid, Marina Conter and Aninha Comas.\nTânia Carvalho was one of the best-known names on television in Rio Grande do Sul, since she returned from São Paulo, where she had been part of the group around filmmaker Glauber Rocha, with her husband and father of her son Fabiano, actor Geraldo Del Rey. Tânia had presented the show \"Variedades\", alongside Célia Bier, on Jornal do Almoço, on TV Gaúcha, later transferring to TV Difusora's competitor, Portovisão. On her debut in Guaíba, she wore a green coat that covered her pregnant belly with her second child with businessman Felício dos Santos, Diogo, who would be born weeks later. Magda Beatriz was the presenter of the news show Câmera 10, on TV Difusora, which aired daily at the end of the night, with a local focus. Liliana Reid had worked on the children's program Clubinho Gaúcha Zero Hora, on channel 12, and came to Guaíba with her husband, programming director Sérgio Reis. Marina Conter had worked decades before at TV Piratini as a poster girl, selling products during commercial breaks, live, at the time. Aninha Comas was a professional cook, popular among Porto Alegre socialites.\nIn April 1981, Guaíba Criança went on air, filling the afternoons with cartoons and children's games. Actor Roberto de Oliveira became \"Remendão\", who presented the program, in the first year with actress Cássia Aguiar and, from the second year, with Vera Mucilo. Children who sent coupons cut out from Correio do Povo or Folha da Tarde could be invited to the program's audience and compete live for the famous quindins given by Remendão.\nPrime time, created by Sérgio Reis, had, from 9:30 pm, right after Guaíba ao Vivo, several local programs. On Mondays, the Cadeira Cativa sports debate was aired, presented by Armindo Antonio Ranzolin. On Tuesdays there was the political interview program Espaço Aberto, presented by Amir Domingues. Other programs from the broadcaster's golden phase were Vox Populi, with interviews, Ask a Guaíba, presented by Portuguese language professor Édson de Oliveira, from the University Pre-Entrance Course, answering questions from viewers and Viajando com a Guaíba, presented by Ernani Behs.\nTV Guaíba was also marked by horse racing broadcasts during commercial breaks, on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, probably thanks to the fact that the owner, Breno Caldas, owns a stud farm and is an avid investor in the sport. The network's Saturday nights, in the early 1980s, were filled with the series Columbo, McMilan and Wife and McCloud, followed by Cine 2.\nWhen Companhia Jornalística Caldas Júnior went bankrupt, journalist and playwright Sérgio Jockymann took the reins of the broadcaster for several months, before businessman Renato Bastos Ribeiro bought the company. During the period in which Jockymann ran the channel, the Aqui e Agora program aired at noon. Soon after, he launched, with producer Claudinho Pereira, the Magda Beatriz Program, featuring cultural interviews. Guaíba Feminina started to be presented in the late afternoons by Marla Martins (daughter of journalist Lasier Martins), Isabel Ibias and Aninha Comas. The Clip Clap music video program was presented by Gaio Fontela. The nights were filled with series and Guaíba Notícias. Every week, José Fontela only lent his voice to the interview program A Nova Face do Rio Grande.\nWith the purchase by Ribeiro, Jockymann and his programming were replaced and the playwright went to court to demand compensation from Ribeiro for his lost expenses. Jockymann joined the channel's \"black list\", never appearing in its images again, even though he was, for years, an important councilor in Porto Alegre. During the Ribeiros' management, the TV was managed by the owner's sister, Helena Bastos Ribeiro. It was almost all rented to independent producers who were responsible for sponsorship sales, giving a percentage to the broadcaster.\nSome of the highlights of TV Guaíba's local programming, after its purchase by the Ribeiro family, were the journalist Flávio Alcaraz Gomes with his program Guerrilheiros da Notícia, which aired daily from 7pm to 8:15pm; Clovis Duarte with Câmera 2, which went on air at 10:30 pm; the doctor and journalist Abraão Winogron with the weekly Medicina e Saúde; José Silvas with Atividade, daily at noon; Marlei Soares with Palavra de Mulher, which was presented during the week from 4:25 pm, Luiz Carlos Reche with Cadeira Cativa and João Bosco Vaz with Encontro com o Esporte, shown on Saturdays; the traditionalist musical Querência, always broadcast from a different municipality in the state, presented by Jair Silva; The Arco-Íris Project was a pioneering program on ecological issues. Sports program presenter Rogério Amaral spent years at the station, with a night program after Guerrilheiros da Notícia.\nAmong the famous series that aired in the last phase of TV Guaíba are: Star Trek, Star Trek: The Next Generation, The Wild Wild West, The Three Stooges, JAG, Mission: Impossible, The Love Boat, Automan, Sharivan, Machine Man, Goggle V, Beverly Hills, 90210, Sabrina, the Teenage Witch, Hack, Haunted and Largo Winch.\nIn early 2003, Rede Record lost coverage in Rio Grande do Sul after its affiliate, TV Pampa, migrated to RedeTV!. At the time, the possibility of forming an affiliation with TV Guaíba was analyzed, but the management of the station in Rio Grande do Sul ruled out this possibility, as it wanted to maintain its independent programming. In April, TV Pampa resumed the network's broadcasts, citing commercial losses with RedeTV!.\nIn 2004, TV Guaíba participated in the Gaucha Football Federation's bid to broadcast Gauchão 2004, together with RBS TV. Guaíba had won the bid and acquired the championship exclusively, having agreed by contract to broadcast 36 games. RBS TV tried to acquire part of the rights, proposing the payment of 500 thousand reais, but Aluizio Ribeiro, the broadcaster's commercial director, ended up refusing.\nTV Guaíba used some professionals from Rádio Guaíba to provide coverage. The team included narrator Paulo Cesar Carvalho, commentators Rogério Amaral and Cláudio Duarte and reporters Denis Luciano and Rodrigo Koch, the latter, on the radio, were sports presenters and on-call staff. Some games were broadcast on VT, with narration by Gilberto Júnior, André Silva and Geraldo Andrade. In the interior of the state, the matches were shown on TV Pampa, which rebroadcast them in regions that were not covered by TV Guaíba. Such transmissions were repeated until the end of the broadcaster, but without broadcast exclusivity, sharing them precisely with RBS TV, including broadcasting VTs of games that took place on days and times when there were no broadcasts from the broadcaster or in Dupla Grenal games in home, usually at night, before or after Camera 2, depending on the time at which the match to be broadcast took place.\nOn February 21, 2007, the administrative director of Sistema Guaíba-Correio do Povo, Carlos Bastos Ribeiro, Renato's brother, announced that TV Guaíba, together with Rádio Guaíba and Guaíba FM had been sold to Grupo Record for an estimated value of 100 million reais. On March 12, the sale of the newspaper Correio do Povo to the group was also confirmed. On the same day, Rede Record announced the termination of the contract with its then-affiliate, TV Pampa, which was scheduled to run until 2008.\nRelations between the two had deteriorated after the Rio Grande do Sul station refused to meet the standards required by the network in its local programming, and also after an unsuccessful attempt to purchase TV Pampa and other outlets from Rede Pampa de Comunicação, which motivated the network to look for a new partnership. However, unlike the Porto Alegre broadcaster, Record continued to maintain its affiliation with the components of Rede Pampa in the interior of the state (TV Pampa Norte de Carazinho, TV Pampa Centro de Santa Maria and TV Pampa Sul de Pelotas) through a secondary agreement expected to run until 2009.\nOn March 16, Grupo Record executive Jerônimo Alves Ferreira was officially presented as the new CEO of the acquired vehicles, which came under his command on March 20. With the change of control of TV Guaíba, an investment plan was drawn up that involved the installation of state-of-the-art equipment, construction of a modern newsroom and the hiring of professionals specialized in the technical, commercial and journalistic areas of the other competitors.\nChannel 2 aired its independent programming for the last time on June 30, and the last program shown as TV Guaíba was Musical (airing The Caliph of Baghdad from the Transtel catalog). Minutes before midnight on July 1, the station aired its traditional sign-on and sign-off video of with images of Rio Grande do Sul to the sound of an instrumental version of \"Gauchinha Bem Querer\", composed by Tito Madi. Then, a slide went live with a countdown to the debut of TV Record Rio Grande do Sul, with orchestrated music playing and carrying the following message: \"Vem aí a TV dos Gaúchos\". At noon, a special program was broadcast presenting the new programming to viewers in Rio Grande do Sul, and then the program Tudo É Possível was shown. On the same day, TV Pampa Porto Alegre returned to broadcasting RedeTV! programming.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Happy Singlehood: The Rising Acceptance and Celebration of Solo Living is a book by Israeli author and scholar Elyakim Kislev. It was published in 2019 by the University of California Press.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nThe book explores the fulfilling lives of unmarried individuals, showcasing their resilience and innovative approaches to building communities and networks. Through personal interviews and research, Kislev challenges societal norms favoring marriage and highlights the benefits of solo living for both singles and couples. The book encourages readers to reconsider traditional social structures and calls for inclusive policies that cater to the diverse needs of unmarried individuals.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nVan Den Berg praised the book for offering a fresh perspective in family sociology by challenging the cultural disapproval of singlehood. She commended Kislev for providing detailed insights into the lives of singles through a wide array of sources, including interviews, blog posts, and quantitative analyses. Van Den Berg appreciated the book's exploration of discrimination against singles and strategies for coping with it, especially highlighting the significance of friendships, independence, and job satisfaction for single individuals' happiness. She also acknowledged Kislev's timely contribution in addressing the overlooked experiences of singles and lauds his suggestions for societal and academic changes to better accommodate singlehood.\nDiaz and Lee commended the book for its timely exploration of the benefits and challenges of solo living in the face of shifting societal norms. They praised Kislev's adept use of quantitative and qualitative data to delve into the experiences of singles, highlighting previously under-explored areas such as discrimination and social support. The reviewers lauded Kislev's nuanced approach to challenging assumptions about marriage and loneliness, particularly his findings on the strengths and social networks of older singles. They also noted his balanced presentation of marriage's social and emotional benefits alongside emerging literature suggesting its downsides.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The history of Antisemitism in Washington, D.C. dates to the establishment of the district in the 18th century. Antisemitic covenants in real estate were common in the city during the early to mid 1900s. During the 2010s and 2020s, there has been an increase of reported antisemitic incidents in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\n\n==== Residential segregation ====\nDuring the early to mid 20th century, Jews experienced antisemitic discrimination in housing in Washington, D.C. Because many white Christian neighborhoods in DC used antisemitic covenants to exclude Jewish people, Jewish real estate developers often choose to build neighborhoods in the Maryland suburbs of Montgomery County and Prince George's County. White Jewish real estate developers including Sam Eig and Esther Eig, Morris Cafritz, Jack and Abraham S. Kay, Carl M. Freeman, and Albert Small dispensed with antisemitic covenants but continued to use racial covenants to exclude African-Americans and other people of color from white neighborhoods. Racist and antisemitic covenants were declared unenforceable by a 1948 Shelley v. Kraemer Supreme Court ruling and were banned by the 1968 Fair Housing Act.\nW.C. and A.N. Miller, a group of privately owned real estate firms in Bethesda, used restrictive covenants to exclude Jewish people and people of color from parts of Northwest DC as well as the Montgomery County suburbs of Bethesda, Chevy Chase, and Potomac. During the Civil Rights Movement, the company came under fire for its use of discriminatory covenants. In 1959, hearings before the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, testimony noted bars against ownership by Jews in areas controlled by the Miller Companies including Wesley Heights and Sumner, with Spring Valley cited to be \"of particular significance\" owing to the prominence of its residents. Members of the public also cited the company's past discrimination in testifying against Washington awarding an urban renewal contract to an affiliated company in 1961. A typical covenant used by W.C. and A.N. Miller reads that \"No part of the land hereby conveyed shall ever be used or occupied by, or sold, demised, transferred, or conveyed under, to, or in trust for, leased, or rented, or given to, Negroes or any person or persons of Negro blood or extractions, or to any person of the Semitic race, blood, or origin, which racial description shall be deemed to include Armenians, Jews, Hebrews, Persians, and Syrians, except that this paragraph shall not be held to exclude partial occupancy of the premises by domestic servants of the occupants thereof.\"\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nAs of 2022, the Anti-Defamation League reported that two white nationalist groups operated in DC: the Patriot Front and Scott-Townsend Publishers. In 2021, propaganda produced by the neo-Nazi Patriot Front was used to target synagogues in DC and Jewish institutions in multiple states.\nIn 2023 and 2024, during the Israel–Hamas war, the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington reported a \"dramatic uptick\" in requests for help from parents, teachers, and students due to a surge in antisemitic incidents in Washington, D.C. and DC's suburbs in Maryland and Virginia.\nIn December, 2023, a man attacked Kesher Israel synagogue in Georgetown, spraying people with an odorous substance while allegedly shouting \"Gas the Jews!\" The assailant was arrested by the police.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAntisemitism in Maryland\nAntisemitism in Virginia\nFrancis Griffith Newlands Memorial Fountain\nHistory of antisemitism in the United States\nHistory of the Jews in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFacing Antisemitism in Washington D.C., Yiddish Book Center\nFacing Antisemitism Head-On, Temple Micah\nFighting Antisemitism, Washington Hebrew Congregation",

        "content": "SAPIO  Sciences is a technology company that develops software to support drug research and discovery processes. Founded by Kevin Cramer, SAPIO Sciences has developed software products for laboratory operations, particularly in biotechnology and chemistry.\n\n\n== History ==\nSAPIO Sciences was established in 2007 in West Manchester by Kevin Cramer and moved to in York, Pennsylvania in 2015. Kevin Cramer has a background in Information Systems from York College, PA. He has co-authored multiple papers in Nature Genetics, applying statistical and machine learning methodologies to genetic data interpretation.\nSAPIO Sciences introduced its first product, Exemplar LIMS 1.0. In 2013, Sapio Sciences launched Web Client 1.0. Sapio was then the first to integrate a full-featured, web-based Electronic Lab Notebook with its LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) built together on a single software platform in 2017.\nIn 2020 the company launched a new Sapio Platform that extended its core platform with additional modules for data analysis and knowledge extraction. The Sapio Platform was iterated on to add templated modules for different life sciences applications, including biotechnology research, next-generation sequencing (NGS), bioanalysis, etc.\nIn 2021, IQVIA and SAPIO Sciences collaborated to provide a Laboratory System to the National Genome Center in Denmark.\nIn November 2022, SAPIO Sciences was fully acquired by GHO Capital Partners LLP, a specialist life sciences investment company based in London.\nIn 2023, the company launched SAPIO Chemistry, which unifies small-molecule and large-molecule discovery workflows on a single laboratory platform.\nIn the summer of 2023, NatureMetrics selected Sapio LIMS to enable environmental DNA sequencing.  In 2023, Oxford Biomedica selected Sapio ELN for its cell and gene therapy research and development business. In 2023, Immunebridge announced it had selected the Sapio Electronic Lab Notebook to modernize its enterprise data management for its work on NK cell-based immunotherapies. In November 2023, Sapio Sciences became the first company to introduce an AI-Chat Scientific Assistant integrated directly into an Electronic Laboratory Notebook (ELN), called ELaiN (Electronic Lab Artificially Intelligent Notebook).\n\n\n== Operations ==\nSAPIO Sciences is focused on expediting drug discovery processes through its unified lab platform that has built-in science applications and data management tools, including web client, data designer, and a workflow engine, among other tools. Kevin Cramer is the founder and CEO.\nThe company is headquartered in York, PA and has offices in Fort Lauderdale, FL, London, United Kingdom, and Seoul, South Korea.\nCompany's key products, formerly known as Exemplar, include: Sapio Platform, Sapio LIMS, Sapio ELN, Sapio Jarvis, and Sapio ELaiN.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSapio Sciences' official website\nGHO Portfolio companies\n\nCategory:Technology companies of the United States\nCategory:Software companies of the United States\nCategory:Chemistry software\nCategory:Companies established in 2007",

She was a co-principal of Kambala School in Sydney and she founded an Australian-French society. She was awarded the Légion d'honneur after her death.\n\n\n== Life ==\nSoubeiran was born in Saint-Jean-du-Gard in 1858 in southern France. In 1870 she was in Paris and after school in Lausanne she emigrated to Australia after her parents died.\nShe returned to France but she was back in Australia in 1886 where she became a teacher at a school named Fernbank in Sydney. The school had been started by Louisa Jane Gurney who was a friend she had previously worked with. Gurney was the daughter of Thomas William Henry Gurney and Theophila, (née Hope) and Sydney University's mathematics Professor Theodore Thomas Gurney was her brother. In 1891 they became co-principals of the school as it moved to Kambala and took the name of its new location. Soubeiran had been to finishing school in Switzerland and the new school aspired to create polite girls who could pass examinations. She taught French at the school and at the Ascham School nearby. At their boarding school she was the housekeeper and she supervised the (French) cookery.\n\nIn 1895 she was one of the founders of the Alliance France which awarded prizes for spoken French.\nShe and Louisa sold the school in 1914 to Clara and Mary Jane Roseby. Together they created the French-Australian League of Help as France and Australia became involved in World War One. Souberain became the Secretary of the League of Help. In 1917 she went to Paris to supervise the distribution of funds and clothes from Australia.\nShe was twice President of the Alliance France de Sydney.\nShe and Gurney moved to Bowral where she lived in declining health.\nSoubeiran died in Darlinghurst in 1933 and she was awarded the Légion d'honneur later that year. The square where she was born in Saint-Jean-du-Gard was named, Place Augustine Soubeiran, after her. The idea for the naming was the 2021 biography by Nelly Duret. Duret noted that Soubeiran's town had no public space named for a woman.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBiography at ADB\nAugustine Soubeiran: Biography (in French) by Nelly Duret, 2021\n\n Media related to Augustine Soubeiran at Wikimedia Commons",

It is known to be one of the early publications supporting political Islam in Turkey. Its founder and editor was Osman Yüksel who used the title of the magazine as his surname.\n\n\n== History and profile ==\nSerdengeçti was first published on 20 April 1947. It was started, edited and published by Osman Yüksel. The magazine came out monthly and was headquartered in Ankara. Its subtitle was The magazine of those who run to God, nation and homeland. It was described on the cover page as the magazine which worships the truth and supports the people. \nSerdengeçti featured critical articles on nationalism and religious affairs and did not publish any advertisement. Osman Yüksel's slogan, \"Tanri Dağı Kadar Türk, Hira Dağı Kadar Müslümanız (Turkish: We are as Turkish as Mount Tengri and as Muslim as Mount Hira), was first published in the magazine and has been used by the nationalist parties in Turkey. It frequently attacked the Republican People's Party and the Kemalist establishment. Although most of the articles were written by Osman Yüksel, leading conservatives such as Nurettin Topçu, Ali Fuat Başgil, Necip Fazıl Kısakürek, Peyami Safa and Eşref Edip also contributed to the magazine. It covered translations of the work by Victor Hugo and Arthur Schopenhauer.\nSerdengeçti folded in 1962 after publishing only thirty-three issues.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"First issue\".

The intent of the platform is to ensure oneness and unity for an early solution to the Naga political issue. Thus assuring inclusivity and stability acknowledging Naga belonging. It reiterates to avoid tribal differences and embrace love and cooperation for better unity to achieve the desired goal without distorting the basic principles of Naga people and most importantly emphasized to promote the welfare of the Nagas.\n\n\n== References ==",

He was widely travelled and participated in antiquarian research.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJohn William Nicholas Hervey was the third of four sons of Frederick Hervey, 2nd Marquess of Bristol. Like his brothers he was educated at Eton and graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1856. He was friends with William Brampton Gurdon, who described Hervey's popularity as \"wonderful\" at both institutions in a later obituary. At Trinity College he developed a friendship with Edward, Prince of Wales. He graduated in 1865 with a degree in classics.\n\n\n== Travel ==\nAfter graduation Hervey visited Egypt, Palestine, and Syria. However during a subsequent visit to Greece in 1866 he was captured by pirates.\nWhilst on a hunting expedition with Henry Strutt, 2nd Baron Belper and Mr Coore. They visited Askatos but went to a more remote area in search of animals to shoot. Not expecting an encounter with brigands, they had not arranged for an escort of gendarmes on this occasion. Having been captured, the pirates agreed to release two of them with a ransome demand. Mr Coore was chosen by lot to remain a captive. Strutt and Hervey were released on parole with a demand for £3,000 in gold to secure Mr Coore's release. They returned with the support of HMS Chanticleer  which remained out of sight while the release of Mr Coore was negotiated.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nWhereas his three brothers, were all elected as Conservative Party Members of Parliament, his three attempts to get elected between 1868 and 1886 as an MP for the Liberal Party all failed.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Follidol tragedy occurred on April 29, 1958 in Kerala, India and was caused by pesticide contamination. In the incident, 64 people lost their lives due to consuming wheat flour that had been mixed with Follidol, a pesticide. The fatal mistake caused because of the preparation of chapatis (Indian flatbread) using the contaminated flour, resulting in a devastating accident.\nThe Lok Sahay Sena, a paramilitary division under the defense of India, organized a camp in Sasthamcotta. Chappathis distributed among the inmates caused the disaster. 41 trainees, two army officers, three camp helpers and 19 local children died in the disaster. During the further investigation, it was revealed that the cans of Folidol, which had been carelessly stored on the ship, had leaked and spilled over the sacks of flour, atta, semolina and sugar stored below.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jeremiah T. O'Sullivan (died February 10, 2009) was a Boston-based federal prosecutor for the United States Department of Justice. In 2012, he was identified as the federal agent who, it is believed, provided immunity to Winter Hill Gang leader James \"Whitey\" Bulger. Bulger  was accused of racketeering and being involved in nineteen murders. O'Sullivan was a lawyer in the 1970s and 1980s, prior to becoming the head of the New England Organized Crime Strike Force. In 1970, he was the Deputy Assistant Attorney-General for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.In February 1979, federal prosecutors indicted numerous members of the Winter Hill Gang, including boss Howie Winter, for fixing horse races. Bulger and his right-hand man Steve Flemmi were originally going to be part of this indictment, but Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent John Connolly and his supervisor John Morris were able to persuade O'Sullivan to drop the charges against them at the last minute. Bulger and Flemmi were instead named as unindicted co-conspirators. In 2009, Connolly was sentenced to forty years in prison for second-degree murder. Morris was granted immunity in exchange for a testimony against Connolly.In 1998, O'Sullivan suffered a heart attack and several strokes after being asked to testify about Bulger and Flemmi. He remained in a coma for a month. Five years later, O'Sullivan spoke in front of Congress during the Committee on Government Reform's investigation of the FBI's Boston branch. He stated that he knew some informants were committing murder and that they had relationships with FBI, but O'Sullivan said he did not act upon the situation because he was \"intimidated by the bureau\". O'Sullivan denied having personally provided protection to Bulger and his associates.In the 2015 movie Black Mass, O'Sullivan was portrayed by Lewis D. Wheeler.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nO'Sullivan was married to Karen (née Hoke).\n\n\n== Death ==\nO'Sullivan died in 2009, aged 66.\n\n\n== References ==",

The historic stone house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 9, 1983, for its significance in architecture. It was listed as part of the Early Stone Houses of Bergen County Multiple Property Submission (MPS).\nBased on architectural evidence, the house was built between 1770 and 1805. According to the nomination form, Andrew H. Hopper was building it when his father Hendrick Hopper died in 1805. He later sold it to his son, Henry A.

CPUs affected include the M1, M2, M3 and A14 series system-on-a-chip processors. \nThe DMP looks at cache memory content for possible pointer values, and prefetches the data at those locations into cache if it sees memory access patterns that suggest following those pointers would be useful. The GoFetch attacks use those speculative cache fetches to undermine a number of different cryptographic algorithms by using memory access timings to exfiltrate data from those algorithms using timing attacks.\nThe authors of GoFetch state that they were unable to make their exploit work on the Intel Raptor Lake processor they tested due to its more limited DMP functionality.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "The Federated States of Micronesia does not recognise same-sex marriage, civil unions or any other form\nof recognition for same-sex couples.\n\n\n== Legal history ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nAccording to the Kaleidoscope Australia Human Rights Foundation in 2015, Micronesia \"had in recent years given several indications of its support for human rights, including those of LGBTI persons. Despite this, the Federated States of Micronesia [h]as yet to introduce legislative change or take other meaningful steps to recognise these rights.\" It enacted comprehensive legislation including sexual orientation as a prohibited ground of discrimination in employment and other areas in 2018, but does not recognize same-sex unions in any form. As a result, same-sex couples cannot access the rights and benefits of marriage, including inheritance, tax benefits, domestic violence protections, and alimony, among others. Civil unions are also not recognized in Micronesia.\nThe Constitution of the Federated States of Micronesia does not address marriage or family, and does not explicitly forbid same-sex marriages. There has been no political and societal movements to legalize same-sex marriages or civil partnerships, and the issue is seldom discussed in civil society.\nMicronesia has two Polynesian outlier islands, Kapingamarangi and Nukuoro, which may, similarly to many other Polynesian societies, recognise a third gender role in their cultures. In Samoa and American Samoa, such individuals are known as faʻafafine and are considered an integral part of Samoan society. If they wish to marry and have children, they will marry women, thus creating the possibility for marriages between two female-presenting individuals to be performed in Samoan culture. It is possible a similar custom exists on these two islands, where they would be known as hakaahina in the Kapingamarangi language and as hagahahine in the Nukuoro language. A similar third gender structure exists in Chuuk where such individuals are known as wininmwáán (pronounced [wininˈmˠaːn]), translating to \"women who behave like men\". However, \"this does not necessarily mean that wininmwáán are sexually active with females [or marry females]\".\n\n\n=== State laws ===\n\nPohnpei laws recognize three types of marriage: statutory civil marriage, statutory religious marriage (Pohnpeian: inou sarawi), and statutory customary marriage (pwopwoud en tiahk en sahpw, pronounced [ˌpʷopʷoˈwut ɛn t̻iˈjɐːk ɛn sɐːpʷ]). Marriage between partners of the same sex is not explicitly banned, but laws generally refer to married spouses as \"husband and wife\". Civil marriage requires a marriage license issued by the Governor of Pohnpei, and solemnization of the marriage to be performed by civil authorities. Religious marriages are solemnized by an ordained minister of a religious denomination, whereas customary marriages are solemnized according to local traditions. The Constitution of Pohnpei does not expressly address marriage, but Article 5 on \"family obligations\" states: \"To strengthen and retain good family relations in Pohnpei, as needed, this Constitution recognizes and protects the responsibility and authority of parents over their children\".\nChuuk statutory laws do not forbid same-sex marriages, but generally refers to the partners as \"husband and wife\" or \"the male\" and \"the female\". In addition to civil marriage, the state also recognizes customary marriages (Chuukese: apwúpwúlú fán eóreni) performed according to local Chuukese traditions. Customary marriages (Yapese: maabgol ni rogon yalean) are also recognized in Yap. The Constitution of Yap does not address marriage rights. The marriage laws in Kosrae assume the partners to be of the opposite sex. Section 16.101 of the Kosrae State Code reads: \"A marriage performed in the State is valid, if: (a) The male at the time of marriage is at least eighteen years of age and the female at least sixteen years of age, and, if the female is less than eighteen years of age, the marriage has the consent of at least one of the female's parents or her guardian; [...]\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nLGBT rights in Micronesia\nRecognition of same-sex unions in Oceania\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Chronos is a framework for pretrained probabilistic time series models developed in 2024 by Amazon Web Services researchers. By tokenizing time series values through scaling and quantization into a fixed vocabulary, Chronos utilizes existing transformer-based language model architectures, specifically training them via cross-entropy loss. The model variations within the Chronos family are based on the T5 family, with sizes ranging from 20 million to 710 million parameters.\n\n\n== Development ==\nChronos was pretrained on a broad array of publicly available datasets, alongside a synthetic dataset created through Gaussian processes to enhance its ability to generalize across different tasks. This approach allowed Chronos to undergo comprehensive pretraining, preparing it for a wide range of forecasting applications.\nPerformance\nIn an extensive benchmark covering 42 datasets—which included both traditional local models and modern deep learning approaches—Chronos demonstrated notable achievements:\nTraining Corpus Performance: On datasets included in its training corpus, Chronos models significantly outperformed competing methods.\nZero-Shot Performance: When tested on new datasets, without specific training, Chronos displayed comparable or occasionally superior performance relative to models that were trained on those specific datasets.\n\n\n== Impact ==\nThe results from various benchmarks highlight Chronos's capability to leverage time series data from diverse domains. This enables it to improve zero-shot accuracy on unseen forecasting tasks markedly. The introduction and success of Chronos models mark a significant step forward, suggesting that pretrained models can serve as effective and simplified solutions in forecasting pipelines across a range of fields.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "2020 was the thirteenth competitive season for the Cairns based Kenfrost Homes Northern Pride Rugby League Football Club. They were one of 14 clubs that competed in the twenty-fifth season of Queensland's top rugby league competition, QRL's Hostplus Cup. The Northern Pride were due to play 12 home games and 11 away games over 23 rounds between March and August, but the season was cancelled after Round One due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBefore the season was cancelled, the Pride played three pre-season trials, two of which attracted large crowds - the trial against the Blackhawks was a curtain-raiser to the NRL Cowboys v Broncos pre-season trial, and the Pride's trial against the Hunters attracted a large ex-pat following.\nCoach Ty Williams named a new six-man 'leadership group' composed of Javid Bowen, Rod Griffin, Matolu Laumea, Patrick Gallen, Tom McGrath, and new recruit Joshua Stuckey. From this group Williams chose Javid Bowen as captain , and Rod Griffin as vice-captain.\nA new three-year naming rights sponsor, Kenfrost Homes was announced in December 2019. The Pride had been without a major sponsor since the Sea Swift sponsorship ended in 2017. The Pride are one of five QCup sides that do not have the financial backing of a major leagues club.\nBefore Round One, the QRL adopted the NRL's COVID-19 guidelines, which included a 'no fans' policy, meaning the games would be played before empty grandstands.\nOn 17 March, two days after the completion of Round One, QRL announced the competition would be suspended for ten weeks due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was hoped QCup would resume with Round 12 in June, but the rapidly deteriorating situation with the pandemic meant on 26 March the Queensland Government announced Stage 1 Restrictions on movements across the Queensland border, which would affect NSW club Tweed Heads Seagulls, PNG club SP Hunters, and the feeder arrangements that Easts Tigers and SC Falcons had with the Melbourne Storm and the Ipswich Jets had with Newcastle Knights. Consequently, the next day QRL cancelled the competition for the 2020 season. QRL managing director Robert Moore stated, \"by making this announcement now, it provides our clubs with the opportunity to re-set and turn their attention towards the 2021 season\". The Pride reduced to a staff of three, with the CEO, Coach and Commercial Manager Alannah Giuffrida retained on reduced wages. Many of the Pride's New Zealand players returned home before the NZ border closed.\nIn the absence of football, the Cairns Post ran a series ranking the top fifty Northern Pride players from the last 12 seasons.\nAs the year progressed, there was talk of staging some games, with the Pride, Blackhawks, Cutters and CQ Capras playing a Northern Championship, but travel costs were prohibitive and the idea was abandoned.\nIn August the 'Kenfrost Homes Lightning Challenge' was held between two CDRL clubs (Brothers Cairns and Tully Tigers), and two teams from the Pride. The Pride combined their ISC side with their HDC U-20s side to make the 'Pride Giants' and 'Pride Reef Kings'. Games were played in Cairns and Tully over six rounds. Pride coach Ty Williams took a back seat, leaving the coaching to Bevan Walker, Pride's ISC assistant coach, and Dave Scott, Pride's HDC U-20 coach. Controversially, two of Brothers Cairns games were abandoned when match officials were abused. The 'Pride Reef Kings' were undefeated and won the competition.\nAt the end of the season, Northern Pride football operations manager Chey Bird resigned. CEO Tony Williamson also resigned.\n\n\n== 2020 Season –  Kenfrost Homes Northern Pride ==\n\nCompetition: Intrust Super Cup\nSponsor: Kenfrost Homes.\nJersey supplier: ISC.\n\n\n=== Staff ===\n\n\n==== Coaches/Trainers ====\nCoach: Ty Williams.\nAssistant coach: Sam Obst.\nAssistant coach: Bevan Walker.\nHastings Deering Colts U-20 coach: Dave Scott.\nMal Meninga Cup U-18 coach: Bobby Berg.\nStrength and Conditioning Coach: Scott Callaghan.\n\n\n==== Captain ====\nCaptain: Javid Bowen.\nVice-captain: Rod Griffin.\n\n\n==== Managers ====\nFootball operations manager: Chey Bird.\nCommercial manager: Alannah Giuffrida.\nChief executive: Mark Quinn.\nChairman: Tony Williamson.\nBoard Members: Peter Parr (replaced by Micheal Luck), Stephen Devenish, Gail Andrejic, Stephen Tillett, Colin Moore, Ian Lydiard, Terry Medhurst.\n\n\n== 2020 squad ==\n\n\n=== Player gains ===\n\n\n=== Player losses after 2019 season ===\n\n\n=== Season launch ===\nPre-Season Training: 4 November 2019, West Barlow Park.\nPre-Season Boot Camp: Daradgee Environmental Education Centre, Innisfail, 17–19 January 2020.\nProfessional Development Weekend with NRL coach Anthony Griffin: Daradgee Environmental Education Centre, Innisfail, 8–9 February 2020.\nSeason launch: 9 February 2020, Mount Sheridan Plaza, Mount Sheridan.\nSeason launch: 7 March 2020, The Pier Bar, Cairns $30.\n\n\n=== Jerseys ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Cairns Post Top 50 Pride players (2008-2020) ===\nIn the absence of football during the pandemic, Rowan Sparkes, sports writer at the Cairns Post published an article ranking the top fifty Northern Pride players from the last 12 seasons.\n\n1.

        "content": "The Theatre of Palaia Epidavros (Greek: Θέατρο Αρχαίας Πόλεως Επιδαύρου), also known as the Small Theatre of Epidauros, is an ancient Greek theatre, located on the slope of the acropolis of the ancient city of Epidaurus, Greece, near the present-day village of Palaia Epidavros.\n\nThe theatre was built in successive phases, the first of which dates back to the Classical period, more precisely during the 3rd century BC, and continued until the Hellenistic period. Further architectural modifications also took place during the Roman period. The site of the theatre was discovered in 1970, and organised archaeological excavations on the site began in 1972. At the same time, other smaller-scale archaeological excavations were carried out on the site in 1989.\nA typical example of ancient Greek theatre, this theatre is semi-circular in shape, with an orchestra at its centre. Initially circular in shape, the orchestra was transformed into a semi-circular shape during the Roman period. To date, 18 rows of seats have been uncovered within the theatre, which is divided into nine sections separated by rows of vertically arranged steps. The seating capacity is estimated at at least 2,000 spectators. The theatre is in a relatively good state of preservation and is undergoing a number of restoration works.\nThis theatre should not be confused with the larger and better-known Theatre of Epidaurus, located near the Asclepion of Epidaurus. Nowadays, the theatre is used as a venue for theatrical performances at festivals such as the Athens-Epidaurus Festival.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRupprecht, Gerd; Mikler, Hubertus; Gogräfe, Rüdiger. \"EPIDAUROS, Hafenstadt\" [EPIDAVROS, harbour town]. theatrum.de (in German).

Music written for the play was composed by Will Butler from the indie rock band Arcade Fire.The play follows a fictional 1970s rock band on the cusp of superstardom as they struggle through recording their new album.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAdjmi and Butler began working on the piece in 2014, with the project being workshopped in 2018 at the Sundance Institute Theatre Lab. Adjmi wanted to create a piece of theatre that felt like the audience was watching a documentary unfolding on stage, while avoiding the piece becoming a full-blown musical. The set design includes real music recording equipment.\n\n\n== Production history ==\n\n\n=== Off-Broadway (2023) ===\nThe play premiered Off-Broadway at Playwrights Horizons on October 6, 2023, with an official opening of October 26. It was named Best Play of the Year by the Washington Post, and \"hands-down the best American play since the pandemic\" by former New York Times critic Ben Brantley. Stereophonic was named Best of 2023 by numerous publications, including the New Yorker, New York Magazine, The New York Times, The Wrap, and Time Out New York. After multiple extensions, the play closed on December 17, 2023, directed by Daniel Aukin.\n\n\n=== Broadway (2024) ===\nIn January 2024, it was announced the play would transfer to Broadway in Spring 2024 for a limited engagement.

        "content": "Kernel build is the process of compiling and configuring the Linux kernel source code to generate a functional kernel image that can be loaded into memory and executed by the operating system. The kernel serves as the core component of the Linux operating system, providing essential functions such as process management, memory management, device drivers, and system calls.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Linux kernel is an open-source software project maintained by a global community of developers. It is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) and is available for various architectures, including x86, ARM, MIPS, and others. While precompiled kernel images are often provided by Linux distributions, users and system administrators may choose to customize and build their own kernels to suit specific requirements or hardware configurations.\n\n\n== Process ==\nThe process of building a Linux kernel involves several steps:\n\nObtaining the Source Code: The first step is to obtain the kernel source code. This can be done by downloading a tarball from kernel.org or by using version control systems like Git to clone the source repository.\nConfiguration: Before compiling the kernel, it needs to be configured. This involves selecting the desired features, options, and device drivers that will be included in the kernel image. Configuration can be done manually through the make menuconfig, make xconfig, or make config commands, or by using pre-existing configuration files.\nCompilation: Once the kernel is configured, it can be compiled using the make command. The compilation process translates the source code into executable machine code specific to the target architecture. This step may take some time, depending on the speed of the system and the complexity of the configuration.\nInstallation: After successful compilation, the newly built kernel image, along with associated files such as kernel modules and firmware, needs to be installed in the appropriate location on the system. This typically involves copying the kernel image to the /boot directory and updating the bootloader configuration to recognize the new kernel.\nTesting and Deployment: Before deploying the new kernel in a production environment, it is essential to test it thoroughly to ensure compatibility with hardware and software components. This may involve booting into the new kernel, running various applications, and performing system stability tests. Once validated, the new kernel can be deployed to production systems.\n\n\n== Importance ==\nCustom kernel builds offer several advantages:\n\nPerformance Optimization: By including only necessary features and device drivers, custom kernels can be optimized for specific hardware configurations, resulting in improved performance and efficiency.\nFeature Customization: Users can enable or disable kernel features based on their requirements, allowing for a more tailored and streamlined system.\nSecurity: Building a custom kernel enables users to apply security patches and updates promptly, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities.\nLearning and Experimentation: Kernel building provides an opportunity for users to learn about the inner workings of the Linux kernel and experiment with different configurations and optimizations.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nLove, Robert (2003).

        "content": "The Bagnayr Monastery is a monastery in Kozluca, Kars, 7 kilometers northwest of Ani, built in the 11th century CE. It was \"one of the most renowned monastic complexes in medieval Armenia\". The monastery was standing at the end of the 19th century, but is now almost completly in ruins.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nAccording to Armenian sources, the 11th century historian Stepanos Asoghik, Vahram Pahlavouni (died 1046) founded the monastery in the year 989. The son of Vahram, Smbat Magistros Pahlavuni, is thought to have founded the main church, Surp Astuacacin, \"Holy Mother of God\". The church's oldest inscription is dated 1042. The monastery was a major religious center in the 1040s and the Pahlavunis maintained their patronage into the 13th century. Various inscriptions mention the construction of chapels in 1145, 1200, 1223 and 1229. The monastery was probably abandoned at the end of the 13th century.\nTwo walls and an arch vaulted door remain, but the annular vault of the door is ruined. At the internal section of the remaining walls, 5 arches and 5 dummy columns are interconnected and epitaphs are placed in between the columns. The middle dome and north wall of the church are collapsed and only 2 columns have remained. The top of the remaining south walls is decorated with geometrical designs in carving technique.\nA large zhamatun, actually larger than the church, was built in the late 12th century, its oldest inscription dating to 1201. It is structured around four free-standing columns and eight engaged semi-columns, and its stone ceiling has nine compartments. The central compartment had a pyramidal vault with muqarnas stalactite moulding, which is considered similar to that of the Church of the Holy Apostles at Ani.\nAn hexagonal chapel stands north of the main complex, and is probably dated to the 9th or 10th century, given its similarity to the church of St. Gregory of the Abughamrents in Ani. This Küçük Kozluca Church, remains partially preserved. This six-foil domed church has lost all of the coverings, and almost all of the exterior stone blocks have been scavenged, but the basic structure remains intact.\nNumerous dedicatory inscriptions have been found on the site.\n\n\n== Style ==\nThe columns are short and rather fat, and are decorated with muqarnas ornementation. Such decorations can also be found in Horomos Monastery (dated 1277) or the Menucihr Mosque (dated 1072-1086).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Sources ==\nKarapetian, Samvel (2013). \"The Inscriptions of Bagnayr Monastery\" (PDF).

Its population is 102 (2023).\nThe village houses the remains of the Armenian Bagnayr Monastery, built in the 10th century CE. The name \"Bagnayr\" means \"cave of fire altars\", suggesting the much earlier presence of a Zoroastrian sanctuary on the site.\n\n\n== Bagnayr monastery ==\nAccording to Armenian sources Vahram Pahlavouni founded the monastery in the year 989. It was probably abandoned at the end of the 13th century. Currently, only one of the original buildings of the complex, the Küçük Kozluca Church, remains partially preserved. This six-foil domed church has lost all of the coverings, and almost all of the exterior stone blocks have been scavenged, but the structure remains intact.\nTwo walls and an arch vaulted door remain, but the annular vault of the door is ruined. At the internal section of the remaining walls, 5 arches and 5 dummy columns are interconnected and epitaphs are placed in between the columns. The middle dome and north wall of the church are collapsed and only 2 columns have remained. The top of the remaining south walls is decorated with geometrical designs in carving technique.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Summit Sport and Recreation Park is a multi-purpose community sports facility located in Mount Barker, South Australia. The $23 million complex officially opened in April 2021, and features a turf Australian rules football and cricket oval alongside two synthetic soccer pitches. It is best known for hosting Australian Football League (AFL) matches as part of Gather Round; the AFL refers to the venue as Adelaide Hills (for the nearby region) in its promotional material. The capacity of the main oval is nominally 5,000, which includes a 270-seat undercover grandstand. However, this capacity can be increased to 7,500 during Gather Round via additional temporary seating. The venue is also utilised by State League 2 South Australia club Mount Barker United SC, with annual visits from the Adelaide United youth team.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 2008, the Mount Barker District Council purchased 36 hectares of land on the corner of Bald Hills Road and Springs Road in Mount Barker prior to 2017 to house infrastructure which would support the population growth of the area. In 2014, Council commenced detailed concept designs in collaboration with the South Australian Office for Recreation and Sport. By December 2017, a business case for the proposed Mount Barker Regional Sports Hub had been put forward, with the intention for construction to commence during 2019–20, and the facility to open during 2020–21. In February 2018, the Council appointed landscape architects Oxygen as the design consultant for the facility. Numerous funding announcements were made in the months following, including a $3.75 million promise from the Turnbull government in August 2018 if re-elected.\nPlanning approval for construction of the site was eventually granted by Council on 7 May 2019. The construction contract was granted to Sarah Constructions in December 2019; initial works began shortly after. The complex was officially opened on 29 April 2021.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSummit Sport and Recreation Park at Austadiums",

        "content": "The Papatoetoe Rugby League Football Club was a rugby league club in Auckland, New Zealand which existed for 4 years from 1929 to 1932. They competed in the Auckland Rugby League lower grade competitions. They were made up of players from the suburb of Papatoetoe in South Auckland. At the time of their existence the area was rural, while today due to urban sprawl it has become a populated suburb of Auckland.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Papatoetoe Schoolboys ===\n\n\n==== Schoolboys (1926) ====\nThe first mention of a rugby league team in Papatoetoe was in fact 3 years before their clubs formation and was a schoolboy team formed from schools in the area. It was the first ever year that schoolboy rugby league had been played in Auckland with games only beginning towards the end of the year in September. Papatoetoe schoolboys played a drawn game with Otahuhu on October 16, 1926, at Carlaw Park. The match was a curtain raiser to the Roope Rooster final between Richmond Rovers and Devonport United (North Shore Albions). Their two tries were scored by Manning and Pinfold. It was stated that as well as including players from the Papatoetoe Primary School they also \"included a number of the Papatoetoe Orphanage boys\". The two school matches had been refereed by G. McCowatt, and Bill Mincham who had played for Auckland in 1915. His son Ted Mincham later played for New Zealand. The Auckland Star said that they 4 schoolboy teams that had played the curtain raisers \"gave a good exhibition of football, making the play open, and throwing the ball about at every opportunity. It is intended next season to have a schoolboys' competition. Already a set of caps for the winners and a valuable cup have been offered for competition\". Their only other match for the year was a 16–8 defeat to a Richmond West schoolboy side in the rugby league strong hold of Grey Lynn.\n\n\n==== Schoolboys (1927) ====\nThe Papatoetoe schoolboys team of 1927 played in a much more organised competition with 10 games played. They won 4 and lost 6, scoring 40 and conceding 138. Their first win was against Otahuhu on May 28 when they won 6–0. On June 4 the Papatoetoe schoolboys played Richmond at Carlaw Park as one of the curtain raisers to the senior mens game. The Papatoetoe side also played a game against Otahuhu a day earlier at Carlaw Park as a curtain raiser to the Devonport v Richmond senior mens game on Kings Birthday.\n\n\n==== Schoolboys (1928) ====\nIn 1928 the Papatoetoe schoolboys team finished mid table. They beat Māngere Schoolboys 8–0 on June 30, and Ellerslie 14-0 a week later on July 14, but their other reported results were a 0–30 loss to Newmarket and a 0–22 loss to Richmond Schoolboys on August 18.\n\n\n=== 1929 Inaugural Papatoetoe club season ===\nIt was reported in the Sun newspaper on April 5, 1929, that during the week “an enthusiastic and well-attended meeting was held in the Papatoetoe Town Hall” to “discuss the advisability of forming a rugby league football club in Papatoetoe. The day the club had officially formed as in fact Tuesday, April 2. The convenors of the meeting were Mr. J. Gedye and Mr. Claude Gartside Culpan, and they explained the reasons for calling the meeting. It was then unanimously decided to form a club which would be called “Papatoetoe Rugby League Football Club”. They had decided to field three teams in the Auckland Rugby League competitions with a practice held on the following Saturday when official team coaches Joe Bennett and J. Gedye would meet the players. Mr. Ivan Culpan, secretary of the Auckland Rugby League also visited during the evening to give some advice. The same evening that the club was formed a deputation from the club “waited on the Papatoetoe Town Board and asked that they be allowed a portion of the local sports areas for the playing of the competition games. The board realising that the progress of the district warranted progress in sport, gave the deputation a very favourable hearing”. The Town Board had received the deputation on the Tuesday indicating that the initial meeting may have taken place on Monday, 1 April. The Town Board was said to have referred the matter to the “Reserves Committee”. The following officers were elected to their inaugural committee:- Patron, Mr. Arthur William Hall, M.P.; president, Mr. W. Civil; secretary, Mr. Claude Culpan; treasurer, Mr. J. Gedye; committee, Messrs. J. Bennett, R. Harper, L. Pinfold, Clarence Gartside Culpan, jun., R. Bennett; coaches, Messrs. J. Bennett and J. Gedye. Their coach, Joe Bennett was a New Zealand international rugby league player from 1920 and had played at senior and representative level from 1910 to 1920 in Auckland.\nThe Papatoetoe Town Board decided a few weeks later, at their May 1 meeting that they would “invite a conference of league and rugby football organisations to discuss provision of playing areas” for the 1929 season. The following evening the codes met and it was “decided to ask the respective organisations to make applications for grounds on the following basis: rugby union, 2; rugby league, 1; hockey, 1”. In the meantime the Papatoetoe club had been unable to gather enough players for three teams and was only able to enter one team, which would play in the 6th B Grade. However they did also field a team in the schoolboys competition. On May 1 the club requested assistance from the Auckland Rugby League in the purchase of jerseys, with the matter referred to the finance committee, giving them the power to act. Although not mentioned at the time it was later mentioned that the clubs colours were blue and gold.\n\nTheir first ever match was against Richmond B at the Papatoetoe Recreation Ground at 2pm on May 4, 1929, with Mr. W. Weston refereeing. The team struggled, losing 37–0, however the Richmond club was the strongest junior club in Auckland in the 1920s and 30s and the Richmond B team would go on to win the grade undefeated, thrashing most teams by similar scores. The first ever Papatoetoe team was published in the New Zealand Herald and was: R. Docherty, Leonard Leaning, Alexander Bow, A. Culpan, R. Field, T. Fielder, Stanley Lusby, Kenneth Pennell, J. Harvey, George Mains, Samuel Pinfold, G. Hamilton, Ronald Leaning, and T. Greer. They performed creditably in the 1929 season, finishing 6th in the 9 team competition, with 5 wins, a draw, and 8 losses, scoring 140 points and conceding 215.\nOn June 15 the first ever senior game of rugby league was played in Papatoetoe when Otahuhu and Point Chevalier Senior B teams met at the Papatoetoe Recreation Ground. The two teams were first and second on the table and finished that way at the end of the season. A crowd of 1,000 interested onlookers turned up to see Otahuhu upset the leaders 10–6. The Auckland Star wrote that “it was a wise move to play a senior match at Papatoetoe, and it is to be hoped that the Auckland League will send teams more often to the district”.To raise money and foster club spirit the club held a series of “progressive card evenings” in the club's rooms, with the first held on Thursday, August 8. It was reported that Mr H. McMechan and Mr. Barrington won prizes at the first event. It was reported in mid November that “in view of the success of [the] card evenings held weekly during the winter months…, it was decided at a function held in the Renown Hall on Thursday evening to continue the evenings for a further period. An average attendance of about forty people was reported by the committee”. On November 2 the league club entered an 880-yard relay team in the opening carnival of the Papatoetoe Amateur Athletic and Cycle Club at the recreation ground. In early October the Papatoetoe Town Board “sought the cooperation of the Auckland Rugby League in a gala day attraction at the opening of the band rotunda” at the Wallace Road Park Reserve on December 14. The league referred the matter to the Papatoetoe League Club for report. The Wallace Road Reserve was situated behind the Papatoetoe Town Hall on the present day site of the Allan Brewster Leisure Centre.\n\n\n=== 1930 Season (4th, 5th and Schoolboy Grades) ===\nThe 1930 season saw Papatoetoe field teams in the 4th and 5th grades as well as a schools team. On May 6 a conference was held by the Papatoetoe Town Board with representatives of the league club, the rugby union club, hockey club, cricket club, and amateur athletic and cycling clubs. The meeting was to discuss the paying of fees by the clubs for the use of sports areas in the town district. The suggestion by the Town Board was that the clubs would be charged £7 10s for a playing area for a season. The clubs “expressed the opinion that the charge was not excessive, considering the work the board intended to carry out, but they questioned the ability of their clubs to find the money”.On Thursday evening, May 22 the club held an “old time dance” at the Papatoetoe Town Hall with music supplied by the Papatoetoe Old Time Orchestra. The hall was decorated in the clubs colours of blue and gold with Mr. J. Henderson and W. Postlewait “in charge of the floor”. The club was congratulated by patron, and M.P. A.W. Hall on the progress that they had made since their inception. Competition dances were held along with a Euchre tournament which was won by Mrs. F. Lusby and Mr. Lusby. At the same event the club's secretary, Mr. Claude Gartside Culpan said three teams had been entered for the season and training was being given to thirty schoolboys. Claude Culpan was a brother of Ivan Culpan, long time secretary of Auckland Rugby League, and Nelson Culpan who was on the New Zealand Rugby League board. Ultimately they didn't field 3 adult teams but did field one more than the previous season with two sides playing.\nThe 4th Grade team only won around 3 of their matches, losing 9 to finish near the bottom of the standings. Likewise the 5th Grade team struggled, reportedly winning 2 matches and losing 12. Their team for the 7th of June match was Hely, McCauley, Leaning (2), Pinfold, Pennell, Hamilton, Hyland, Billington, Paterson, Marshall, Fielder, Graham, Matson, and Lusby. Their primary schools side performed much better, winning at least 5 of their games, drawing 1, and losing 4 to finish relatively high in the 18 team standings.On December 4 the club held their final card evening of the year at the Renown Hall in Papatoetoe. Their card season had run from May to December, and a “large attendance of players and supporters of the club” was present. Treasurer Mr. Laurence Lovett presented the prizes for the evening and reported that the club had had a successful season financially. Their patron, the Reform Party M.P. Arthur Hall made a lengthy speech about the comparison's between parliament and sports which was quoted in part in the Auckland Star on November 3.\n\n\n=== 1931 season (3rd Open, 4th, 7th, and Schoolboy Grades) ===\nAt their 1931 annual meeting in mid April a large attendance of players and supporters was present. With F. Healy presiding the report and balance sheet showed that the club was in a sound financial position. The following officers were elected:- Patron, Mr. Arthur Hall, M.P.; president, Mr. J. Franklin; vice presidents, Messrs. Eric Holdsworth Burton, W. Balderson, G. Cregan, F.E. Carr, H.C. Ernest, William Dulihanty, P. Dawson, J. Walker, W. Young, Thomas Richard Smytheman, William Nesbitt, B.L. Liversy, F. White, Albert George Grinter, P.E. Suttie, W. Willcox, C.J. Mahon, J. Gedye, P.W. Walker, Dr. James Jefcoate Valentine and Alfred Barrett Jameson; secretary, Mr. Laurence William Lovett; assistant secretary, Mr. C. Patterson; auditor, Mr. Neville St George; chairman of committee, Mr. J. Kidd; club captain, Mr. Joseph Henderson; coaches, Messrs. Laurence Lovett, Gallaher, Coon, Henderson; executive committee, Messrs. J. Kidd, E. Leaning, C.G. Culpan, F. Healy, E. Morris, N. Harris, W. Coon, R. Marshall, and J. Henderson. Their auditor, Neville St George was a former New Zealand rugby league international who was still playing senior rugby league at this time but nearing the end of his career. He was living in Papatoetoe at the time despite playing for the North Shore Albions based in Devonport where he had grown up. They decided to nominate five teams for the season, third grade open, fourth grade, fifth grade, sixth grade, and schoolboys.\nAlmost immediately after being named patron once more, Arthur Hall collapsed while in Wellington due to an intracerebral hemorrhage on April 16 and died 2 days later at Wellington Hospital aged 50.Very few results were reported during the season. Of the 3rd grade open sides 12 matches only 3 results were reported. They were a 27–0 loss to Marist Old Boys on June 20, a win by default over Glen Lynn on July 4, and a 17–0 loss to Richmond Rovers on July 11. They then lost to Ponsonby United in the first round of the knockout competition on September 5. Their team for their first match of the season was Abbott, Campbell, Dawson, Billington, McDonald, Pinfold, Dockerty, Rawson, Mattson (captain), Pennell, Linburn, Culpan, Fowler, Green, and McKenzie. Their 4th Grade side finished towards the bottom of the standings with just one reported win (5-0 v Papakura on June 27), and 9 losses. The win over Papakura was played at Prince Edward Park in Papakura and a small piece describing the match was published in the Franklin Times. Their winning try came in the second half after they broke out and followed up a kick to score near the posts. The Papatoetoe 7th Grade team faired a little better, winning 3 matches, drawing 2, and losing 4, with 6 other results not reported. This meant that they finished around mid table in the 8 team competition. Their primary school team had 5 wins reported and just 1 loss with 9 scores not reported meaning they likely finished in the first 3 out of 10 sides competing.\nOn June 3 the club published a notice in the Auckland Star newspaper thanking Mr. R. Hatton for his donation for their jersey fund, while they posted a similar notice on the same day in the New Zealand Herald thanking Mr. R. Hilton. On July 24 the club held their annual ball at the Papatoetoe Town Hall. The hall was decorated in their blue and gold colours with Mr. J. Franklin, the club president welcoming visitors. While Messrs. Laurence Lovett, J. Smith, J. Henderson, Rawlands, and Kidd in charge of the programme.\n\n\n=== 1932 Final Season (5th grade, Schoolboys) ===\n In 1932 the Papatoetoe club only fielded a single side in the adult grades, which was in the 5th Grade, and their schoolboys team once more. The 5th Grade team struggled and reportedly only won one match, 13–0 against Akarana on August 27, and 12 losses where they struggled to score any points. Their schoolboys side was also not particularly competitive, winning 2, losing 9, and having 8 results not reported to finish near the bottom of the standings. Following the season the club no longer fielded any teams and rugby league was not represented by any clubs in the area until the Papatoetoe Panthers club formed decades later which is based at Kohuora Park in Papatoetoe.\n\n\n=== Team Records ===\n\n\n==== Most Senior Team ====\nThe season record for the most senior men's team in the club.\n\n\n==== Schoolboy Team Record ====\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Miss Grand Guadeloupe is a national beauty pageant title awarded to Guadeloupe representatives who competed at the national event, Miss Grand France, or an international stage of Miss Grand International. The title was first awarded in 2013 to a 22-year-old from Le Moule, Orphelie Morti, who then competed in the international event in Thailand. In 2013 and from 2017 to 2019, the right to send Guadeloupe representatives to Miss Grand International belonged to the national pageant of Miss International Guadeloupe, headed by Georges Nandan.Guadeloupe joined the Miss Grand International pageant four times, but all of its representatives were unplaced.\n\n\n== History ==\nGuadeloupe made its debut in Miss Grand International in 2013 when Orphelie Morti was appointed by Georges Nandan, the director of Miss International Guadeloupe pageant, to compete in the Miss Grand International 2014 pageant in Thailand, and then no Guadeloupe candidates in the pageant from 2014 to 2016.After three consecutive years of absence, Guadeloupe competed in Miss Grand International again in 2017, after the organizer of the Miss International Guadeloupe pageant obtained the license and the title of Miss Grand Guadeloupe was considered one of the supplemental titles in that year's pageant, in which it was delivered to Krystel Landry, who then competed at Miss Grand International 2017 in Vietnam, but was unplaced. The contract between the mentioned national organizer and MGI PCL was discontinued at the end of 2019. Since then, as of 2023, no Guadeloupe candidate has competed at the Miss Grand International, despite the title of Miss Grand Guadeloupe being awarded annually; the titleholders were not sent to compete internationally.\n\n\n== National and international competition ==\nFrom 2013 and 2017 to 2019, the runners-up of Miss International Guadeloupe were sent to compete internationally in Miss Grand International. Later in 2024, Guadeloupe sent its representative to participate in Miss Grand France, as detailed below.\n\n\n== References ==",

Siyabulela Shai too was given a chance at Mamelodi Sundowns, but was loaned out to several clubs. He got his Premier Soccer League debut on loan at Chippa United in 2014. In 2015–16 he was on loan at Maritzburg United, but was recalled to Sundowns in January 2016. \nHe departed from the Sundowns due to not getting playing time. He surfaced at the club EC Bees in 2017. The team contested the SAFA Second Division, but was in the round of 32 of the 2016–17 Nedbank Cup. \nShai stayed in the second tier with Black Leopards and Marumo Gallants without playing regularly. In 2019–20 he played for VOS Milan in the Regional League, which was also hampered by the pandemic. A move to All Stars was also put on hold, but in late 2020 he was finally able to restart his career in Sekhukhune United. The club was promoted to the 2021–22 South African Premier Division, which marked Shai's return to the first tier after a several-year absence. He did not play often in 2021–22, however, and was accused of \"off-the-field antics\". He got more playing time in the 2022–23 season, but afterwards left for Platinum City Rovers.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The Song of Alexander (also known as the Syriac Alexander Poem or Metrical Homily) is a Christian Syriac text written between the 6th and 7th centuries AD concerning legends about Alexander the Great. It had been falsely attributed nearly unanimously in the manuscript tradition to Jacob of Serugh (451–521), and for this reason, the author is sometimes referred to as Pseudo-Jacob (or Ps-Jacob). It is also presently thought to have been written closely after and have been influenced by the Syriac Alexander Legend, and so its date is closely tied to when the latter is dated.\nThere are two main hypotheses that concern the relation between the Song and the Legend. The first was proposed originally by Theodor Nöldeke and asserts that the Song textually depended on the Legend. The second was proposed by Wilhelm Bousset and argues that there is no direct dependence; instead, they share a common source. Today, opinion has shifted towards Nöldeke's position with its defense by Reinink, who placed the date of the Song to 628–636, in the immediate years after the composition of the Legend which he dated to around 628. Both positions nevertheless have remained options. The dating of the Song has typically depended on its post-dating the Legend and this has placed it in the years following the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628. A recent proposal however has dated the Legend to the mid-6th century and, in turn, views the Song as a composition of some time during or after the last quarter of the 6th century.\nAn English translation and Syriac edition of the text was published by Budge in 1889. The standard critical edition today is that of G.J. Reinink published in 1983.\nIn antiquity, the Song gave rise to an Arabic translation known from two manuscripts.\n\n\n== Motifs and themes ==\n\n\n=== The fish and the water of life ===\nThe Song elaborates on a popular legend about Alexander the Great also known from the Alexander Romance, Talmud, and other sources. In this legend, Alexander is travelling along with his company in search of the Fountain of Life that grants the drinker immortality. He encounters a wise old man who tells Alexander that he might identify the water of life by washing salted fish in the diverse springs in his region. One of Alexander's cooks named Andrew is one of the ones instructed with the task of testing out the springs. He begins washing one of the fish in the water. Suddenly, the fish springs to life and escapes into the water, swimming away into a river. The cook is worried that this will anger the king, Alexander, and so he tries to catch it but to no avail. He notifies Alexander of the event but also tells him that, during his episode, he had discovered the fountain of life. Alexander is happy and goes to bathe in the water, but in trying to approach the water enters suddenly into a middle of darkness and is unable to reach it. Alexander is sad, but is consoled by the wise old man; at this point the story shifts into questions asked to the wise man by Alexander and the responses he receives. This story draws on Christian iconography, where bathing in the fountain is represented in baptismal terminology, and the fish symbolizes Jesus who rises from the dead.\n\n\n== Manuscripts ==\nThe Song is known from five manuscripts, which have been known to group into three recensions:\n\nRecension 1:\nParis, Bibliothèque nationale de France. Paris syriaque 13. Fols. 177r– 187v. 18th–19th century.\nMingana Collection at Selly Oak. Birmingham Mingana syr. 88. Fols. 16r–24v (with a lack of 4 fols. after fol. 19). 15th century.\nBerlin 169 (Sachau 192). Fols. 65v–99v. From Ṭūr ʿAbdīn, 18th  century.\nRecension 2:\nBritish Library. Add. 14624. Fols. 20v–34r. 9th century.\nRecension 3:\nBnF. Paris syriaque 243. Fols. 299v.–318r. A Maronite MS from Rome dated in 1610.\nIn turn, the Song gave rise to an Arabic version which is also known from two manuscripts.\n\n\n== Editions ==\nG.J.

        "content": "The Bendigo Field Naturalists Club (BFNC) is an Australian regional scientific natural history society, dedicated to the study, appreciation and conservation of the natural environment. It is located in Bendigo, in central Victoria and focuses on the native biodiversity of the Bendigo Valley.\nThe main vision of the club is to see a \"secure and healthy natural environment that sustains our biodiversity, and a community that understands and values it\", and the purpose of their activities are to encourage education, conservation and enjoyment of nature within the Bendigo Valley.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nThe club holds monthly face-to-face meetings from February to December, on the second Wednesday of the month. In these meetings, the club invites a guest speaker to present on a topic related to conservation and native flora and fauna. The club also holds excursions several times a month, each with a specific interest focus, including day and night walks, conservation activities and talks from visiting experts in the area or field.The club's conservation work includes a nest box project, that has been carried out consistently since 1986, with club members sourcing, installing and maintaining 500 nest boxes for brush-tailed phascogale. The club as received a significant response from the scientific conservation community for their work, with studies indicating that the nest box project has played a key role in preventing localised extinction of the species in the Bendigo area, including Greater Bendigo National Park and Bendigo Regional Park. In recent years the project has been undertaken in collaboration with Parks Victoria and the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning.The club has also successfully lobbied against commercial timber harvesting works within native bushland. In 1971 the club lobbied for the continued protection and conservation of the Bendigo Whipstick Forest. In 2020, the BFNC submitted an official opposition to the Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action (DEECA) regarding the continuation of the Western Victoria Regional Forest Agreement, noting it was economically unsustainable and severely impacting the native flora and fauna of the region. In response to public outcry, severe bushfires, prolonged legal action, and court decisions, DEECA marked the ending of the agreement at the end of 2024, six years earlier than the original agreement planned.The BFNC is a primary stakeholder in the Bendigo Sustainability Group Festival, in collaboration with the Bendigo Family Nature Club, Sustainability Victoria, Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action, and several other community and government groups.The BFNC is a member of the South East Australian Naturalists Association, and has previously hosted several of the association's biyearly naturalist club camps. The club is also a member of the Australian Naturalists' Network.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first version of the club, the Field Naturalists Club of Bendigo, was formed in August 1945 by first President Marc Cohn, Senior Vice-president Hugh Milne and Junior Vice-president and Secretary Jack Ipsen. The name was changed organically to the Bendigo Field Naturalists Club over the latter half of the 1940s, being officially recognised in the early 1950s.Zoologist and Director of the National Museum of Victoria, Charles Brazenor was a supporter of the club, hosting several talks on native fauna at club meetings during the 1950s.The BFNC inspired the creation of the Castlemaine Field Naturalists Club, with many of the Castlemaine club's founding members coming from the BFNC. Throughout the last near half-century of both club's activities, the clubs have maintained a close relationship, sharing many activities and functions.The BFNC, in collaboration with the Ararat Field Naturalist Club, organised and partially funded the erection of a stone seat memorial in 1950, to Grampians pioneer and explorer Daniel Sullivan (1836 to 1895), in recognition of his work identifying wildflowers in the region.On a field trip in 1953, the club discovered the first and only known fossil of a prehistorical chelicerate or brachiopod specimen in Heathcote. The specimen was initially identified by Cincinnati University as a previously un-discovered species Silurian eurypterid, which they named Melbourneopterus, after the nearby state capital. The club attracted scientific attention after the discovery, and intensified their efforts in finding more specimens, however no others were found. 60 years after the discovery, the identity of the taxonomic placement is still uncertain.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nThe FNCB publishes a monthly field naturalist magazine, The Whirrakee, from February to December. Issues include information on club meetings, short articles, details of upcoming events, and reports of excursions, camps, meetings and presentations. The club's first newsletter, The Bendigo Naturalist, began publication on 10 September 1945, by editor Hugh Milne. Milne continued to publish the newsletter at intervals over several years until it ceased publication. The newsletter was upgraded to a magazine in 1967, under the same title but with a higher page count, and saw consistent publication. The Whirrakee began publication in 1979, acting as both a newsletter for members and a magazine for articles on the flora and fauna of the region.The club has also published an extensive list of native flora and fauna field guides to the Bendigo Valley, including guides for local birds, orchids, eucalypts, frogs and reptiles, spiders and wildflowers.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nClub newsletter, The Whirrakee",

        "content": "During the Byzantine period, in the years between Constantine the Great's rise to power (324 AD) and the conquest of Jerusalem by the  Rashidun Caliphate in 637, Jerusalem was under the control of the Byzantine Empire. The essential change in the character and status of the city, compared to the Roman period, was its transformation from a pagan city to a Christian city. The Byzantine rule developed the Roman colony Aelia Capitolina in Jerusalem, turning it into a central Christian city from a religious and administrative point of view (with the administration subject to the institutional-religious hierarchy) and a world center for pilgrimage. At the end of the period, between the years 614–628, Jerusalem was conquered by the Sasanian Empire, but was later recaptured by Byzantine Christians in 629 CE. Jerusalem was captured by the Rashidun Caliphate in 637 CE as part of the Siege of Jerusalem (636–637).\n\n\n== The Temple Mount in the Byzantine period ==\nAs part of the Temple Mount Sifting Project, rich findings from the Byzantine period were discovered, including mosaic pieces, ceramics, coins and the remains of large buildings, leading the team to believe there was very likely a Byzantine church built there in antiquity. The Bordeaux Pilgrim reports in 333 about the statues of the emperor Hadrian on the Temple Mount, but it is likely that the idolatrous statues were soon removed. On the Madaba map, the Temple Mount does not appear at all, and since the size of the elements on the map expresses their importance, its absence expresses its lack of importance. Some scholars believe the Temple Mount and its surroundings were even used as a municipal dump. In 361, the emperor Julian came to power, who wanted to renew the face of the empire and retreat from Christianity back to paganism. As part of his Anti-Christian worldview, he also proposed to rebuild the Jewish Temple. The cornerstone of Julian's temple was laid in May 363, but construction stopped about a month later. After the death of Julian, his successor Jovian returned the empire to Christianity.\n\n\n== Jews in Byzantine Jerusalem ==\nIn 329 AD, Constantine the Great issued laws prohibiting Jews to own Christian slaves, prohibited mixed marriages and punished by death conversion of Christians to Judaism. Jews did not belong to the Eastern Orthodox faith, which was the state church of the Byzantine Empire. Jews were subject heavy restrictions when approaching Jerusalem, which led to a distancing from the traditions connected with the Mount of Olives. Jews could still practice faith under the rule of the Byzantines, as long as they paid the Fiscus Judaicus. During the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628 many Jews sided against the Byzantine Empire in the Jewish revolt against Heraclius, which successfully assisted the invading Persian Sassanids in conquering all of Roman Egypt and Syria.\n\n\n== Structure of the city ==\nResearchers agree that the Byzantine Jerusalem was based on the Roman city of Aelia Capitolina, characterized by two north–south streets: the Cardo, extending south from the Damascus Gate along the Tyropoeon Valley. The religious center of the city was the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Its proximity to the Cardo has turned the area into a bustling center of activity throughout the year in general, and on the many holidays in particular. An important urban focal point between the Church of the Holy Sepulchre  was Hezekiah's Pool and the Church of Saint John the Baptist.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Arabik Baghdasarian (Armenian: Arapik Baghdasarian; August 25, 1939 – January 29, 1986) was an Iranian cartoonist, graphic designer and translator.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBaghdasarian was born in Sari in 1939. He finished his studies in the Faculty of Fine Arts of Tehran University in the field of painting and spent about a year studying graphics in France. He worked in the fields of caricature, graphics and book illustration and then succeeded in directing short films, fiction and animation.Baghdasarian died on November 9, 1364, at the age of 46.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBaghdasarian's caricatures were published in one or two prestigious magazines of that time, including Negin magazine under the pseudonym Petros Karamian, remaining incognito for many years. Iranian art historian Rouyin Pakbaz introduces Baghdasarian as a knowledgeable, sharp and masterful artist, adding that he \"was not recognized as he should have been in his time. He worked in the fields of illustration and book design, animation, poster, and advertising art; But he was more interested in humor and caricature. He found black humor to be a suitable medium to express his philanthropy and social sensitivities. In this context, he tested the methods of the old and new satirist masters.\"Baghdasarian worked in graphics and book illustration at the Center for Intellectual Development of Children and Adolescents and then at the Franklin Publishing Institute.

        "content": "The German atrocities of 1914 were committed by the Imperial German Army at the beginning of World War I in Belgium, particularly in Wallonia, and in France in the departments of Meuse, Ardennes, and Meurthe-et-Moselle.\nDuring three weeks in August and September 1914, these acts of violence claimed thousands of civilian casualties among the population suspected of harboring [[Francs-tireurs|francs-tireurs]], in violation of the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907.\nExecutions were carried out quickly and without fair trial, following decisions taken by German forces under the laws of war. Twenty thousand houses were also destroyed, including 600 in Visé and 1,100 in Dinant, Wallonia, the Belgian region on the main axis of the invasion that suffered most from these atrocities.\nThese massacres, widely reported and exploited by the Allied press, placed Germany in a delicate international position and contributed to its discredit. International public opinion, especially in the United States, viewed Germany very negatively. This indignation was heightened when Germany declared an all-out submarine war and torpedoed Lusitania in 1915. These facts were exploited by pro-war movements in the United States and by American propaganda to encourage volunteers to enlist.\n\n\n== Location ==\nMost of the massacres took place in Wallonia and no province was spared since the German plan had placed it at the center of the invasion axis. In all the Walloon provinces, about a hundred villages were affected, in each of which at least ten civilians were shot. In Dinant, where several districts were burned to the ground, the number was as high as 674.\nHowever, the events went beyond Wallonia and Belgium: in France, too, thousands died under the same conditions, especially in the Ardennes, the Meuse, and Meurthe-et-Moselle departments.\nIn the United Kingdom and the United States in particular, this \"German barbarism\" turned public opinion in favor of the war.\n\n\n=== In Belgium ===\n\nFrom August 5 to 26, 1914, the Imperial German Army put more than 5,000 civilians under fire in a hundred Walloon villages and destroyed more than 15,000 houses, including 600 in Visé and 1,100 in Dinant, which represents 70% of the destruction carried out in France and Belgium at the beginning of the invasion.\nThe following list is not exhaustive, since it includes only those localities that suffered at least ten deaths:\n\nAugust 5: Berneau and Soumagne (118 civilian casualties).\nAugust 6: Battice (33 civilian casualties), Blegny, Esneux, Sprimont, Magnée, Moelingen, Olne, Hermée, Rétinne and Romsée.\nAugust 7: Warsage, Herstal, Lixhe and Louveigné.\nAugust 8: Baelen, Francorchamps, Herve and Labouxhe-Mélen (72 civilians shot from surrounding villages).\nAugust 9: Sint-Truiden.\nAugust 10: Linsmeau.\nAugust 14: Barchon.\nAugust 15: Wandre.\nAugust 16: Visé.\nAugust 18: Haccourt, Heure-le-Romain and Tongeren.\nAugust 19: Aerschot (156 civilians killed) and Attenrode.\nAugust 20: Liège, Érezée, Andenne (218 civilian casualties), Franc-Waret and Somme-Leuze.\nAugust 21: Arsimont and Auvelais.\nAugust 22: Anloy, Mussy-la-ville, Neufchâteau, Tintigny (120 civilian casualties), Tamines (383 civilian casualties), Bouffioulx, Farciennes, and the Charleroi region (250 civilian casualties).\nAugust 23: Ethe (218 civilian casualties), Bièvre (17 civilian casualties), Bouge, Dinant, Neffe and Bouvignes-sur-Meuse (674 civilian casualties in the sack of Dinant), Hastière-par-delà (19 civilian casualties), Spontin, Waulsort, Flénu, Jemappes, Nimy, Quaregnon, Ville-Pommerœul, Saint-Léger and Virton.\nAugust 24: Bertrix, Houdemont, Izel, Offagne, Hermeton-sur-Meuse, Namur and Latour (71 civilian casualties).\nAugust 25: Leuven (248 civilians killed), Anthée (13 civilian casualties), Romedenne, Surice, and Zemst (more than 10).\nAugust 26: Arlon, Dourbes (3 civilian casualties), and Frasnes-lez-Couvin (12 civilian casualties), the last Walloon locality to be hit.\n\n\n=== In France ===\nAugust 1914: Haybes (2200 inhabitants).\nAugust 10: Jarny (3500 inhabitants, 25 shot).\nAugust 11: Bazailles (population 230).\nAugust 12: Badonviller (2,100 inhabitants, 84 houses burned, 12 civilians killed and 14 deported).\nAugust 20: Nomeny (1,300 inhabitants, 55 dead).\nAugust 23: Fresnois-la-Montagne (500 inhabitants, 102 houses burnt, 68 civilians killed).\nAugust 24: Gerbéwiller (the Battle of Gerbéviller).\nAugust 27: Crèvecoeur sur Escaut 13 civilians murdered.\nSeptember 2, Senlis: In retaliation for the resistance of the French troops, who were retreating while continuing to fight, the mayor, Eugène Odent, was taken hostage along with several random civilians. He was abused and then shot. To justify their actions, the Germans claimed that civilians had joined the French army in firing on them, but this was never proven. Even if this had been the case, the Hague Convention in effect in 1914 was often disregarded. A total of 29 civilians were killed in and around Senlis during the nine days of occupation: either directly, because the Germans used civilians as human shields, as they had done on a large scale in Belgium, or indirectly, as a result of the bombing of the town and the fires set by German troops.\nSeptember 6, Recquignies (Nord). At the beginning of the siege of Maubeuge, 13 hostages were shot on the banks of the Sambre near Boussois. They were French and Belgians living in Recquignies and Boussois. According to written testimony, they were shot by soldiers of the 57th infantry regiment from Barmen.\n\n\n== Explanations ==\nThe Encyclopédie de la grande guerre (1914-1918) (Encyclopedia of the Great War 1914–1918) deals with the question of the law of war in an article that refers to all the problems posed by civilians in the law of war and, among other things, the fact that the participation of non-belligerents \"is an illegal act that can be freely punished by the power that detains them\".\n\n\n=== Francs-tireurs ===\nTwo Irish historians, John Horne and Alan Kramer, authors of German Atrocities (published in Dublin in 2001), and who have extensively consulted French, Belgian, and German archives, conclude that the German belief that francs-tireurs fired on German troops in the early days of the August 1914 attack is a \"sincere misconception\". The authors also try to understand the roots of this belief:\n\nIn the real experience of the French franc-tireurs of the Franco-German war of 1870.\nIn a certain conservatism on the part of the German leaders (political and military), suspicious of popular uprisings.\nIn a confused feeling that the resistance of the Belgian army, which they had not expected, was illegitimate because it played into the hands of the French. This belief persisted in 1940 when 80 inhabitants of Vinkt in Flanders were shot, the Ardennes hunters had just defeated a German regiment.\nIn the existence of a Civic Guard, inherited directly from the Belgian Revolution and considered by the Germans as francs-tireurs because it was organized in bourgeois paramilitary groups.\nIn certain technical elements of the weapons of the time or certain peculiarities of the sites (as at Les Rivages).\nIn the panic that led German troops to kill each other, facts that had to be covered up by the General Staff.\nIn Apologie pour l'histoire (The Historian's Craft), Marc Bloch writes: \"Many Belgian houses have narrow openings in their facades, designed to facilitate the placement of scaffolding by masons; in these innocent mason's tricks, German soldiers in 1914 would never have dreamed of seeing so many loopholes, prepared for snipers, if their imagination had not long since been hallucinated by the fear of guerrilla warfare.\n\n\n=== The French counter-offensive ===\n\nThese exactions may also have been because the Germans took it particularly badly when Belgium:\n\nDid not accept the terms of the German ultimatum (allowing German troops to pass through its territory to attack France).\nAllowed the French army to counterattack the German army on Belgian soil.\nThe Belgian position was based on the fact that Belgium's independence and neutrality were guaranteed by the signatories of the London Treaties (Treaty of the Eighteen Articles and Treaty of the XXIV Articles). According to this argument, Belgium was obliged to refuse the passage of the German army through its territory. On the other hand, according to the same argument, as soon as its neutrality and independence were violated, France and the United Kingdom could and should intervene.\nThe German position was based on the fact that, in their view, Belgium had to ally itself with France and the United Kingdom, thus betraying its neutrality, to prepare counter-offensive operations before the German attack.\nThe fact that many exactions took place immediately after the battles of the French counteroffensive (especially Dinant) supports this explanation.\nAxel Tixhon, Professor of Contemporary History at the University of Namur, goes even further and proposes a third hypothesis:\n\n\"German troops knowingly organized these massacres, with orders to do so [...] Given the number of cases and the fact that they were committed by different German armies, we can assume that orders were given to terrorize the Belgian population. Testimonies and writings attest to these orders, particularly within the 3rd German Army, made up of Saxon troops, which crossed eastern Belgium, the Condroz and attacked Dinant\".\nThe Schlieffen Plan and later the Blitzkrieg concept were based on a rapid attack on Belgium and France (Germany would take the initiative) and on the expected inertia of the United Kingdom. The resistance of the Belgian army and the rapid French and British responses were expected to thwart this plan.\nThese atrocities, which Germany thought would be quickly forgotten after a brief, victorious war, gave Germany a terrible image among neutral nations.\n\nOn May 10, 1918, Charles Spindler wrote in his diary:\n\nI met Dr. L., who is now in the German propaganda department. He had just returned from Switzerland, where he had observed the superiority of French propaganda. \"We lack competent journalists in Germany,\" he told me. \"Our propaganda literature proves this. You can't read anything more stupid or clumsy. The result is that all neutrals are against us\". I objected: \"Are you sure that propaganda is the cause? In my opinion, the question is this: Were there acts of cruelty and violence in Belgium and France? - Of course there were, but they were inevitable. So, no matter how many talented journalists you hire, you won't be able to erase the crimes. The cause is wrong and cannot be defended.\"\n\n\n== Posterity ==\n\n\n=== Parallels with the German offensive in 1940 ===\nThe memory of the massacres of 1914 provoked an exodus of millions of Belgians and French to the south in May 1940. This exodus was one of the many explanations for the French defeat in the Battle of France, especially when they crossed the Meuse at Sedan on May 13 and 14, 1940. The roads clogged with fleeing soldiers sometimes hampered the progress of French divisions up the line, as in the case of the 3rd Reserve Armored Division during the armored counterattacks on Sedan.\n\n\n=== Commemorations ===\nIn May 2001, a reconciliation ceremony was held in Dinant, presided over by the German Secretary of State for the Army, who asked for forgiveness on behalf of Germany in a speech delivered in front of the Charles-de-Gaulle bridge that connects the two banks of the Meuse.\nThe extent of the massacres in this region and the way they were lived and commemorated there explain the different memories of the First World War in Flanders and Wallonia and may, among many other factors, explain the very different behavior of the Flemish and Walloon regiments at the Battle of the Lys.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBerben, Paul; Iselin, Bernard (1967).

        "content": "Shalini Mardolkar (15 August 1939 – 7 January 2013) was an Indian actress, singer, playwright, and director known for her work in Hindi, Konkani films, and tiatr productions.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nShalini Mardolkar was born on 15 August 1939 in Mardol, Goa which was part of Portuguese India during the Portuguese Empire (now in India). From a young age, she showed a strong inclination towards acting.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMardolkar began her artistic journey through Marathi and Gujarati dramas during her formative years. Through her participation in these productions, directed by seasoned artists, she cultivated an understanding of the art of acting. At a young age, Mardolkar established the Shalini Songit Mandal group and showcased her talents as a child artist. Her initial foray into Marathi drama at the age of 5 was followed by endeavors in the Gujarati theater scene. As Mardolkar matured, her acting prowess reached new heights, and she gained acclaim in the realm of Marathi dramas in Bombay. Her skills extended to the Gujarati theater, where she made contributions. It was in 1949, at the age of approximately 10, that she made her debut on the Konkani stage in Anthony Franklin Coelho's tiatr titled Bhau-Bhoinn (Brother-Sister). Despite her youth, Mardolkar demonstrated talent, holding her own alongside seasoned professionals. In this production, she portrayed a lead role opposite C. Alvares, who was around 29 years old at the time. Mardolkar's performance was further enriched by her duet with Anthony Mendes. Her maiden appearance left an impression on tiatr enthusiasts, thereby securing her a position in the tiatr field. It was C. Alvares who reintroduced Mardolkar to Konkani tiatrs through his own production, Vojem (Burden). This marked the beginning of her popularity among tiatr audiences, who eagerly anticipated her performances. Consequently, Mardolkar became a regular presence in tiatrs directed by tiatrists such as J. P. Souzalin, Jacinto Vaz, Anthony D'Sa, Robin Vaz, Prem Kumar, M. Boyer, Alfred Rose, and others. Her versatility as an actress, coupled with her ability to portray diverse roles across a range of tiatrs, solidified her as one of the popular tiatr artists of her time.\n\nMardolkar's artistic contributions extended beyond the confines of her religious convictions. During the Lenten season, religious dramas were traditionally staged in both Goa and Bombay. A highlight in her career was her portrayal of Mother Mary in J. P. Souzalin's religious tiatr (theater performance) titled Saibinnicheo Sat Dukhi (Our Lady's Seven Dolours), which took place in Mapuçá, Goa in 1963. Mardolkar's depiction of Mother Mary garnered critical acclaim and earned her recognition within the tiatr community. Her performance resonated with the audience, particularly during the crucifixion scene, evoking an emotional response as spectators were moved to tears. The impact of her acting was so significant that after the conclusion of the tiatr, people eagerly sought Mardolkar's blessings, regarding her as a representation of Mother Mary. The audience bestowed the title \"Dukhant Bhorloli Saibinn Maim\" (The Grieving Mother Mary) upon her in recognition of her performance in the tiatr. Her portrayal in Saibinnicheo Sat Dukhi was regarded as the most memorable role of her career, as she herself expressed in previous interviews. In addition to her acting prowess, Mardolkar possessed a singing talent. She frequently collaborated with artists such as Anthony Mendes, M. Boyer, Master Vaz, Jacinto Vaz, C. Alvares, and Robin Vaz, delivering duets, trios, and quartets. As her career progressed, Mardolkar had the privilege of working with directors including Jacinto Vaz, Robin Vaz, Prem Kumar, M. Boyer, Anthony D'Sa, and Alfred Rose. She showcased her comedic abilities in various tiatrs, often sharing the stage with Anthony Mendes. Mardolkar's voice left a mark on Goan culture, resonating in households across the region. Her rendition of the popular lullaby/song \"Dhol Mojea Bai\" (Rock my baby) in Frank Fernand's film Nirmon (1966) solidified her status as a singer and actress. The song, specifically composed for Mardolkar, continues to be played on HMV Records and audio tapes.\nMardolkar's filmography includes performances in several Konkani films. Among her popular works are the films Nirmon and Mhoji Ghorkarn (1969), both directed by her husband, Hindi film director A. Salaam. Mardolkar's portrayal of lead characters in these films, opposite actors such as C. Alvares and Jacinto Vaz, captivated audiences and received recognition from film authorities for their quality. Mardolkar's acting credits also include a role in the film Amchem Noxib (1963). The movie Nirmon was subsequently remade in Hindi as Taqdeer (1967), with Mardolkar reprising the main role once more. Her artistic journey also encompasses the realm of video films, where she lent her talents to Mogachi Faxi, a Konkani production produced and directed by C. Alvares. Beyond her on-screen appearances, she ventured into the realms of writing and directing, creating two tiatrs (Konkani theater productions) titled Sounsaracho Gaddo (The bullock cart of the world) and Korta To Bhogta (One who acts has to pay). The former gained popularity with performances staged throughout Goa during the mid-1990s. As of 1995, remaining an active participant in the Konkani stage, Mardolkar's presence was frequently seen at tiatrs by playwrights in Goa. In addition to her acting and directing endeavors, Mardolkar has performed vocals for over 50 musical compositions. She also had over 500 tiatr performances to her credit, both in her own productions and collaborations with others.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMardolkar married Hindi film director A. Salaam, who lived in Bombay. In 1995, Mardolkar was living with her family in Khar, Bombay. According to an anecdote from 1980 by Konkani actor Premanand Sangodkar, Mardolkar and her husband had a bungalow in Bandra, Bombay at that time.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nMardolkar was honored with the \"best actress award\" for her performance in the Konkani film Nirmon (1966) by the Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, at the State Awards for Films. Additionally, she was recognized with the \"Lifetime Contribution to Tiatr Award\" by the Tiatr Academy of Goa (TAG) in 2009. Mardolkar's contributions to Konkani tiatr were also acknowledged during the centenary celebrations of the art form in 1992 by the Kala Academy Goa.\n\n\n== Death ==\nMardolkar's declining health, attributed to her advanced age, culminated in her death on 7 January 2013, at her home in Vasai, Maharashtra, India, at the age of 73.\n\n\n=== Reactions ===\nTiatr critic and journalist Daniel F De Souza expressed deep regret at the death of Mardolkar, highlighting her significant influence on the stage from the 1950s to the 1980s. Despite her absence from the stage for a period, her impact, particularly as a role model for future generations, cannot be overlooked, writes De Souza. Noting her performance in M. Boyer's tiatr Ekuch Rosto (Only One Way), De Souza emphasizes Mardolkar's portrayal of a traditional Hindu woman as her most memorable stage achievement. Tomazinho Cardozo, the president of Kala Mogi, Candolim, expressed his condolences, emphasizing the loss suffered by the tiatr community and the Konkani language due to Mardolkar's death. Her talent made a significant impact on the development of Konkani tiatr, writes Cardozo.\nOn 9 January 2013, the chairman of Kala Academy, Vishnu Wagh, mourned the death of Mardolkar, expressing sorrow over the loss. He praised Mardolkar as a versatile actress whose impact on the Konkani tiatr stage will be cherished by enthusiasts of the arts for a long time. Wagh emphasized that her absence has left a void in the Goan Konkani tiatr stage, highlighting that Mardolkar's contributions will always be held in high regard by the art community in Goa. The Tiatr Academy of Goa (TAG) released a statement highlighting Mardolkar's versatility as an actress and her ability to captivate audiences with her performances. Recognizing her contributions to the tiatr stage, Mardolkar received the \"Tiatr Academy's Lifetime Contribution to Tiatr Award\" in 2009.

        "content": "Thomas Mitchell (March 3, 1816 – July 15, 1894) was an American politician and farmer. A Republican and Anti-Monopolist, he represented the 19th district in the Iowa House of Representatives from 1858 to 1860 and the 28th district in the Iowa Senate from 1874 to 1878. He is the founder of Mitchellville, Iowa and is considered the first white settler of Polk County, Iowa.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMitchell was born on March 3, 1816, in Claremont, New Hampshire to William and Dorothy (née Blake) Mitchell. His father died when he was 16, putting strain on the family. He became a farm laborer while receiving a limited education in country schools. In 1836, he began working at a paper mill, and in 1837 began traveling to sell books and paper from the company he worked for.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMitchell moved to St. Charles, Missouri in 1839, and briefly worked on a farm there. In 1840 he moved to Iowa and began working at Keosauqua, soon relocating to Fairfield. In 1844, he moved to Polk County and built a log cabin near Camp Creek to service travelers, which was the first house built in the county outside of Fort Des Moines. He also began cultivating crops and raised an orchard. He is often regarded as the first white settler of Polk County. In 1846, he claimed 1,080 acres of land in what is now Beaver Township.\nThe same year, he was elected the first sheriff of Polk County. In 1848, he ran for the 6th district of the Iowa House of Representatives, but was defeated in the general election by Manly Gifford. In 1857, he was elected to the Iowa House of Representatives from the 19th district, which constituted Polk County, and was a member of the Claims Committee. In 1859, he was elected to the board of supervisors of Polk County, serving as a commissioner for six years.\nIn 1867 he founded the town of Mitchellville, and explicitly forbade saloons in the town. In 1873 he was elected to the Iowa Senate from the 28th district, which constituted Polk County as well. He helped to establish the ‘Girls’ Industrial School’ at Mitchellville, and served on its board of trustees. He was an abolitionist throughout his life, being a friend of John Brown, and maintained a station on the Underground Railroad.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMitchell married twice, first to Almira Swift of Thetford, Vermont on August 14, 1841, then to Anna Caroline Mattern on June 17, 1861, after Swift's death in 1860. He had five children with his first wife and three children with his second. He was often called “Uncle Tommy” by those who knew him. He died on July 15, 1894, at his residence in Mitchellville, at the age of 78. He was a Universalist by faith. Thomas Mitchell County Park in Polk County bears his name.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Principle of Deference to variant opinions in Islamic law (Arabic: قاعدة مراعاة الخلاف, romanized: qa'idat mura'at al-khilaf) is a legal rule defined by the Kuwaiti Encyclopedia of Islamic Jurisprudence as: “Whoever believes that something is permissible should refrain from doing it if someone else believes it is forbidden. Likewise, with regard to obligation, it is desirable for someone who sees the permissibility of something to do it if there are among the imams those who see it as obligatory.”\n\n\n== Scholarly Views ==\nSome scholars take this rule, including:\n\nAl-Zarkashi\nIzz al-Din ibn 'Abd al-Salam\nTaj al-Din al-Subki\nal-Suyuti\nSome of these scholars consider that staying out of a dispute is better than getting involved in it, and some of them say that being considerate of a dispute is a form of piety. Those who take this rule cite the Qur'an: “Avoid much suspicion; Indeed, some suspicion is sinful,” and the hadith: “Leave what makes you doubt you for what does not make you doubt.”\nAmong the scholars are those who do not allow it to be taken, including:\n\nIbn Qayyim al-Jawziyya\n\n\n== Conditions for Application ==\nApplying this principle requires certain conditions to be met.\n\nThe first condition: that observance does not lead to violating an established text of Sharia, and this includes two issues:\nThe first issue: That observance does not lead to violating the Qur’an or the established Sunnah.\nThe second issue: That observance does not lead to violating consensus (ijma').\nThe second condition: that it is possible to combine the opinions of the scholars. If the imams disagreed about something with more than one opinion, and it was possible to combine their statements, we would combine them and come out of the disagreement.\n\n\n== External links ==\nDarul Ifta Misriyyah Article\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Lake Fork Peak is a 12,881-foot-elevation (3,926 m) mountain summit in Taos County, New Mexico, United States.\n\n\n== Description ==\nLake Fork Peak is part of the Taos Mountains which are a subset of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. It is the second-highest point in the Wheeler Peak Wilderness and ranks as the sixth-highest summit in New Mexico. The mountain is located within the Carson National Forest, 12 miles northeast of the town of Taos and 1.24 miles west-southwest of Wheeler Peak, the highest point in the state. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains to the Rio Hondo which is a tributary the Rio Grande. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises 2,900 feet (880 meters) above the South Fork Rio Hondo in less than one mile (1.6 km). The mountain's toponym has been officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names, and the name refers to Lake Fork which is a creek that originates between this peak and Wheeler Peak. The peak has also been known as Fairview Mountain.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification system, Lake Fork Peak has an alpine climate with cold, snowy winters, and cool to warm summers. Due to its altitude, it receives precipitation all year, as snow in winter and as thunderstorms in summer. Climbers can expect afternoon rain, hail, and lightning from the seasonal monsoon in late July and August. This climate supports the Taos Ski Valley area immediately north of Lake Fork Peak.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mountain peaks of New Mexico\n Mountains portal\n\n\n== Gallery ==",

        "content": "Bislim Hoti (born 27 May 1959), whose first name is sometimes spelled Beslim, is a politician in Kosovo from the Balkan Egyptian community. He was the first leader of New Democratic Initiative of Kosovo (IRDK) and served in the Assembly of Kosovo from 2001 to 2007.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nHoti was born in the village of Rogovë in the Gjakova municipality, in what was then the Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija in the People's Republic of Serbia, Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. He attended a higher professional school of construction and worked in construction design.\n\n\n== Politician ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nHoti ran as an independent candidate in Gjakova for the 2000 Kosovan local elections. He was not elected.\nThe New Democratic Initiative of Kosovo was founded in March 2001; Hoti was among its founding members and was chosen as its first leader. Later in 2001, he represented Kosovo's Egyptian community in a delegation to Germany to study that country's municipal administration.\n\n\n=== Parliamentarian ===\nHoti appeared in the lead position on the IRDK's electoral list in the 2001 Kosovan parliamentary election, which was held under closed list proportional representation, and was elected when the list won two seats. He served in the parliamentary group of the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK), was second vice-president of the assembly committee on emergency preparedness, and was a member of the committee on the rights and interests of communities and the committee on petitions and public requests.\nHe led the IRDK's list in the 2004 parliamentary election and was re-elected when the list again won two seats. He again served in the AAK's parliamentary group, was vice-president of the committee on the rules of procedure of the assembly, and was a member of the committee on the rights and interests of communities and for return. In January 2007, he was elected as a member of the assembly presidency.\nThe AAK participated in Kosovo's coalition governments between 2001 and 2007, and Hoti was a supporter of the administration in both his assembly terms. In 2005, he called for parties representing Kosovo's minority communities be included in negotiations on the status of Kosovo.\nXhevdet Neziraj succeeded Hoti as leader of the New Democratic Initiative of Kosovo in 2007. Kosovo adopted a system of open list proportional representation prior to the 2007 parliamentary election; Hoti appeared second on the party's list, received the second most votes of its candidates, and was not re-elected when the party fell to only one seat in the assembly.\n\n\n=== Since 2007 ===\nHoti received the first position on the IRDK's list for Gjakova in the 2009 Kosovan local elections and was elected when the list won a single seat in the assembly. After the election, he served as deputy chair of the assembly for communities.\nIn late 2010, Hoti left the IRDK to establish the League of Egyptians of Kosovo (LEK). He appeared in the lead position on the party's electoral list in the 2010 Kosovan parliamentary election; the list did not cross the electoral threshold for assembly representation.\nHoti rejoined the IRDK on 20 July 2013 and once again appeared in the lead position on the party's list for Gjakova in the 2013 local elections. The list did not, on this occasion, win any seats in the assembly. He appeared second on the IRDK list in the 2014 parliamentary election, finished third among the party's candidates, and was not elected when the list won only one seat.\nA candidate named Beslim Hoti appeared in the fourteenth position on the list of New Kosovo Alliance (AKR) for Gjakova in the 2017 Kosovan local elections. Online sources do not specify if this was the same person. The candidate finished in seventh place and was not elected when the list won one seat.\n\n\n== References ==",

This is also their first season in San Fernando, after playing in Angeles City during their first two seasons.\nThe Giant Lanterns' first game in San Fernando was a win against Manila on May 24. From July 22 until September 19, Pampanga earned eight consecutive wins as the team finished 14–7 in a three-way tie for the second seed in the North Division. By tiebreaker criteria, Pampanga settled the fourth seed, the same seed they were in previously. After a tight three-game series against the Bataan Risers, Pampanga would fall to the eventual champion Nueva Ecija Rice Vanguards in a sweep.\nThe team played all of their home games at Bren Z.

        "content": "Bylkyldak (Kazakh: Былқылдақ; Russian: былкылдак), also known as Balkyldak is a salt lake in Pavlodar District, Pavlodar Region, Kazakhstan.\nThe lake lies within an industrial zone 11 kilometers (6.8 mi) to the north of Pavlodar town.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nBylkyldak is a natural lake part of the Irtysh basin. It lies in a tectonic depression of the Kulunda Plain, 6 kilometers (3.7 mi) to the east of the course of the Irtysh. Bylkyldak is surrounded by cultivated fields and small sectors of steppe vegetation. Lake Koryakovka is located 8.5 kilometers (5.3 mi) to the east.\nThe lake was used as a reservoir by a chlor-alkali plant built in 1973 at the time of the Kazakh SSR which operated until 1993. Nowadays the sediments of the lake are highly contaminated with mercury. A clay wall was built along the western shore to prevent the polluted Bylkyldak water to reach the oxbow lakes of the Irtysh to the west. Close to the northeast there is an artificial reservoir.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nDespite warnings from environmentalists, the lake is used by local people for swimming in the summer. Fish caught in Bylkyldak, such as dace, tench and crucian carp are heavily contaminated with mercury, but they are eaten by locals. The lake is also visited by wild ducks, which are hunted and consumed by local people as well.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of lakes of Kazakhstan\nAtygay (lake)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Bylkyldak (lake) at Wikimedia Commons\nО возможной опасности озера Былкылдак предупреждают экологи\nBylkyldak - lake of sadness",

        "content": "René Legros (June 19, 1872, in Fécamp in Seine-Inférieure - July 26, 1954) was a French inventor.\nHe perfected, invented, and manufactured several engines and different automobiles, as well as many accessories used on modern cars. He was also passionate about history and photography; he also produced numerous articles in the bulletin of the friends of old Fécamp as well as numerous photographs printed on postcards. He was also the vice president of the first free radio station in the Pays de Caux, Radio Normandie.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n1894: René Legros comes into possession of a 7 HP Phaeton , the first car built by Hippolyte Panhard , which could not exceed 20 km/h. This first car had raced a Bordeaux-Paris and, in 1930, it covered itself with glory during the Paris-Deauville race.\nFrom 1894 to 1897: by studying the first models of this kind, René Legros will perfect and invent his models. He devotes himself to extensive research, to multiple tests on various models which he acquires regularly. He first studied existing engines and worked on both 4-strokes and 2-strokes. He cooperated with the first manufacturers Panhard-Levassor , Peugeot , Marquis de Dion , as well as with isolated engineers who, like him, sought to improve engines. He also works with many qualified journals. He tests and fumbles on various engines and chassis. He does many things to modify, simplify, invent to improve. He also goes to all the competitions.\nFrom 1897 to 1900: until 1897, he stuck to experiments and tests. But for the Universal Exhibition of 1900 , he developed a light oil cart in the form of a two-seater \"spider\" body, a 3 hp finned engine, for a price of 3,600 francs, and a second type: a dog car with three or four seats, a 4 hp engine, for a price of 4,000 francs. It announces, at the same time, a five-seater tonneau break. His car is called “The Simplest.\" It is elegant, solid, and has no chains or corner sprockets. The weight of this car ranged from 230 to 260 kg, depending on the type. We must believe that this car represents progress since La Plus Simple obtained the bronze medal at the Universal Exhibition of 1900. At the same time, René Legros was awarded a gold medal for a 1,250 kg electromobile car built in collaboration with the engineer Albert Meynier, with whom he remained in contact for some ten years. This car, without chains or differential, powered by an engine developing up to 8 hp and weighing 102 kg, is suspended on springs to avoid shaking as much as possible. It has electric and mechanical brakes, accumulators, and electric lanterns. It is equipped with a 500 kg battery and can travel 100 kilometers without recharging at an average speed of 10 km/h. The manufacturing license was transferred to Éts Henneton in Paris on July 1, 1901.\n1904: The two-stroke engine appears, either with two or three cylinders, with 10 to 12 horsepower, equipped with a chassis specially designed for its use. Certainly, tests of two-stroke engines had been carried out elsewhere, but the practical application was due to René Legros. He launched his engines at sea, and the 18-hp cruiser “René Legros” won success: a gold medal and first prize at the Fécamp regattas of 1905, 1906, and 1907; a silver medal and second prize at the Grande Maritime Week in 1906; and,  at the Le Havre regatta the same year, a silver medal and a third prize.\n1906: He wins an event of European reputation: the Paris-Monte-Carlo-Paris Regularity Competition November 25–December 5. He will win the prize in his category with a diploma and silver plaque offered by the International Sporting Club of Monte-Carlo. Its 10 HP did wonders, and it will be one of the highlights of the show, where it will be exhibited covered in glorious dust. René Legros surprised all the technicians at the time, and we saw the brightest future for him. In particular, thanks to his numerous patents that he took: for his two-stroke engine; for his faceted cardan shaft, which plays the role of a flexible joint and facilitates transmissions; for an elastic coupling sleeve combined with the clutch itself, which avoids premature wear and even breakage and, therefore, major inconveniences. He is more interested in research than honors. The first manufacturer to be able to practically produce the two-stroke engine takes no glory from it. With his business developing more and more, René Legros was obliged to take representatives in Paris, such as the Hanriots, with whom he signed a contract on July 6, 1900, agreeing to provide them first with three and then six cars per month with a 10% commission. But the war bankrupted the company of René Legros, who then fell into oblivion and died on July 26, 1954.\n\n\n== Patents ==\nApril 1899: Electric motor for automobiles and electric transformer, in collaboration with Albert Meynier.\nApril 1900: Electric brakes.\nJune 1900: Combiner for electric cars.\n1901: Elastic sleeve.\n1902: Faceted gimbal.\n1903:  Rheostat-radiator, in collaboration with G. Viel.\n1903:  Fan-ozone generator, in collaboration with G. Viel.\n1904: Two-stroke engine.",

It is set to be released through Cactus Jack Records and Atlantic Records in the summer of 2024. The album was supported by two singles, \"Bandit\" and \"Deep in the Water\", with its title being subtly revealed in the official music videos for both singles. It serves as the follow-up to Toliver's previous album, Love Sick (2023).\n\n\n== Singles and promotion ==\nOn February 1, 2024, Toliver released the lead single of the album, \"Bandit\", alongside the official music video, where its title was secretly revealed before it was announced. The same day, he took to Twitter to reveal that he would be releasing a new album soon. On March 13, he revealed that it would be released in the summer that year through a post on social media, where he also secretly revealed its title. The following day, Toliver released the second single, \"Deep in the Water\", where he also secretly hinted at the title of the album again in its accompanying video. On March 17, 2024, while performing at the hip hop music festival Rolling Loud at the SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, he confirmed the title of the album before performing an unreleased song from it.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Waste Input-Output (WIO) model is an innovative extension of the environmentally extended input-output (EEIO) model. It enhances the traditional Input-Output (IO) model by incorporating physical waste flows generated and treated alongside monetary flows of products and services. \nIn a WIO model, each waste flow is traced from its generation to its treatment, facilitated by an allocation matrix. \nAdditionally, the model accounts for the transformation of waste during treatment into secondary waste and residues, as well as recycling and final disposal processes. \nBy including the end-of-life (EoL) stage of products, the WIO model enables a comprehensive consideration of the entire product life cycle, encompassing production, use, and disposal stages within the IO analysis framework. As such, it serves as a valuable tool for life cycle assessment (LCA).\n\n\n== Background ==\nWith growing concerns about environmental issues, the EEIO model evolved from the conventional IO model appended by integrating environmental factors such as resources, emissions, and waste. The standard EEIO model, which includes the economic input-output life-cycle assessment (EIO-LCA) model, can be formally expressed as follows\n\nHere \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A}\n  \n represents the square matrix of input coefficients, \n  \n    \n      \n        F\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle F}\n  \n denotes releases (such as emissions or waste) per unit of output or the intervention matrix, \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y}\n  \n stands for the vector of final demand (or functional unit), \n  \n    \n      \n        I\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle I}\n  \n is the identity matrix, and \n  \n    \n      \n        E\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E}\n  \n represents the resulting releases (For further details, refer to the input-output model). A model in which \n  \n    \n      \n        F\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle F}\n  \n represents the generation of waste per unit of output is known as a Waste Extended IO (WEIO) model. In this model, waste generation is included as a satellite account.  \nHowever, this formulation, while well-suited for handling emissions or resource use, encounters challenges when dealing with waste. It overlooks the crucial point that waste typically undergoes treatment before recycling or final disposal, leading to a form less harmful to the environment. Additionally, the treatment of emissions results in residues that require proper handling for recycling or final disposal (for instance, the pollution abatement process of sulfur dioxide involves its conversion into gypsum or sulfuric acid). Leontief's pioneering pollution abatement IO model did not address this aspect, whereas Duchin later incorporated it in a simplified illustrative case of wastewater treatment.  \nIn waste management, it is common for various treatment methods to be applicable to a single type of waste. For instance, organic waste might undergo landfilling, incineration, gasification, or composting. Conversely, a single treatment process may be suitable for various types of waste; for example, solid waste of any type can typically be disposed of in a landfill. Formally, this implies that there is no one-to-one correspondence between treatment methods and types of waste.  \nA theoretical drawback of the Leontief-Duchin EEIO model is that it considers only cases where this one-to-one correspondence between treatment methods and types of waste applies, which makes the model difficult to apply to real waste management issues. The WIO model addresses this weakness by introducing a general mapping between treatment methods and types of waste, establishing a highly adaptable link between waste and treatment. This results in a model that is applicable to a wide range of real waste management issues. \n\n\n== The Methodology ==\nWe describe below the major features of the WIO model in its relationship to the Leontief-Duchin EEIO model, starting with notations. \nLet there be \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          n\n          \n            P\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n_{P}}\n  \n producing sectors (each producing a single primary product), \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          n\n          \n            T\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n_{T}}\n  \n waste treatment sectors, and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          n\n          \n            w\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n_{w}}\n  \n waste categories.

This asymmetry poses a challenge for solving the equation. However, the Duchin-Leontief environmental IO model addresses this issue by introducing a simplifying assumption:\n\nThis assumption (3) implies that a single treatment sector exclusively treats each waste. For instance, waste plastics are either landfilled or incinerated but not both simultaneously. While this assumption simplifies the model and enhances computational feasibility, it may not fully capture the complexities of real-world waste management scenarios. In reality, various treatment methods can be applied to a given waste; for example, organic waste might be landfilled, incinerated, or composted. Therefore, while the assumption facilitates computational tractability, it might oversimplify the actual waste management processes.\n\n\n=== The WIO model ===\nNakamura and Kondo addressed the above problem by introducing the allocation matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        S\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle S}\n  \n of order \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          n\n          \n            T\n          \n        \n        ×\n        \n          n\n          \n            w\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n_{T}\\times n_{w}}\n  \n that assigns waste to treatment processes:\n\nHere, the element of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          S\n          \n            k\n            l\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle S_{kl}}\n  \n of \n  \n    \n      \n        S\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle S}\n  \n represents the proportion of waste \n  \n    \n      \n        l\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle l}\n  \n treated by treatment \n  \n    \n      \n        k\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k}\n  \n.

This MOE-WIO table distinguishes 80 production sectors, 10 waste treatment sectors, 99 waste categories, and encompasses 7 greenhouse gases (GHGs). The MOE-WIO table is available here. \n\nEquation (7) can be used to assess the waste footprint of products or the amount of waste embodied in a product in its supply chain. Applied to the MOE-WIO, it was found that public construction significantly contributes to reducing construction waste, which mainly originates from building construction and civil engineering sectors. Additionally, public construction is the primary user (recycler) of slag and glass scrap. Regarding waste plastics, findings indicate that the majority of plastic waste originates not from direct household discharge but from various production sectors such as medical services, commerce, construction, personal services, food production, passenger motor vehicles, and real estate.\n\n\n=== Other studies ===\nMany researchers have independently created their own WIO datasets and utilized them for various applications, encompassing different geographical scales and process complexities. Here, we provide a brief overview of a selection of them.  \n\n\n==== End-of-Life electrical and electronic appliances ====\nKondo and Nakamura assessed the environmental and economic impacts of various life-cycle strategies for electrical appliances using the WIO-table they developed for Japan for the year 1995. \nThis dataset encompassed 80 industrial sectors, 5 treatment processes, and 36 types of waste. \nThe assessment was based on Equation (6). \nThe strategies examined included disposal to a landfill, conventional recycling, intensive recycling employing advanced sorting technology, extension of product life, and extension of product life with functional upgrading. \nTheir analysis revealed that intensive recycling outperformed landfilling and simple shredding in reducing final waste disposal and other impacts, including carbon emissions. \nFurthermore, they found that extending the product life significantly decreased environmental impact without negatively affecting economic activity and employment, provided that the reduction in spending on new purchases was balanced by increased expenditure on repair and maintenance.\n\n\n==== General and hazardous industrial waste ====\nUsing detailed data on industrial waste, including 196 types of general industrial waste and 157 types of hazardous industrial waste, Liao et al. analyzed the final demand footprint of industrial waste in Taiwan across various final demand categories. Their analysis revealed significant variations in waste footprints among different final demand categories. For example, over 90% of the generation of \"Waste acidic etchants\" and \"Copper and copper compounds\" was attributed to exports. Conversely, items like \"Waste lees, wine meal, and alcohol mash\" and \"Pulp and paper sludge\" were predominantly associated with household activities \n\n\n==== Global waste flows ====\nTisserant et al developed a WIO model of the global economy by constructing a harmonized multiregional solid waste account that covered 48 world regions, 163 production sectors, 11 types of solid waste, and 12 waste treatment processes for the year 2007. Russia was found to be the largest generator of waste, followed by China, the US, the larger Western European economies, and Japan.  \n\n\n==== Decision Analytic Extension Based on Linear Programming (LP) ====\nKondo and Nakamura applied  linear programming (LP) methodology to extend the WIO model, resulting in the development of a decision analytic extension known as the WIO-LP model. The application of LP to the IO model has a well-established history. This model was applied to explore alternative treatment processes for end-of-life home electric and electronic appliances, aiming to identify the optimal combination of treatment processes to achieve specific objectives, such as minimization of carbon emissions or landfill waste. Lin applied this methodology to the regional Input-Output (IO) table for Tokyo, augmented to incorporate wastewater flows and treatment processes, and identified trade-off relationships between water quality and carbon emissions. A similar method was also employed to assess  the environmental impacts of alternative treatment processes for waste plastics in China.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWIO table compiled by the Japanese Ministry of the Environment.",

In 2023, he won the case from the labor court, being entitled to receive around R$ 420,000 in compensation.  However, due to the fans' great affection for the player, the possibility of returning from forced retirement for another season of his professional contract appeared in 2024, with the player becoming official again in the Confiança squad on 13 March 2024.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nConfiança\nCampeonato Sergipano: 2014, 2015, 2020, 2024\nCSA\nCampeonato Alagoano: 2018\nIndividual\nCampeonato Sergipano top scorer: 2013, 2016\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLeandro Kivel at ogol.com.br (in Brazilian Portuguese)\nLeandro Kivel at Soccerway",

He is considered the founder of Maquoketa, Iowa.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nGoodenow was born on March 23, 1812, in Springfield, Vermont. When he was eight years old he moved with his family to Warren County, New York, and worked on his father's farm. He was educated in common country schools.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAt the age of 22, Goodenow bought a canal boat and used it to freight various farm products across the Champlain Canal. After two years he began to employ men to operate the boat and became a clerk at a general store in Moriah, New York. In 1837 he formed a partnership with his employer and traveled to Wisconsin Territory as a representative of the firm to buy land and engage in business, settling in what is now Maquoketa, Iowa. He began raising crops shortly thereafter. His dealings helped the Maquoketa area to become an established trading center.\nHe built a cabin in what is now the central part of the town and established a mill six miles north of Dubuque. In 1839 he sold his mill and moved back to New York, where he married Eliza Wright. He soon returned to Maquoketa with his wife and established its first post office in 1842.\nIn 1850 he was elected to the Iowa House of Representatives from the 19th district, which constituted Jackson and Jones counties. He was a member of the Road and Highways Committee. He also served as Maquoketa's first mayor for three terms, served as Jackson County assessor and gave Osceola and Kossuth counties their names.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nGoodenow married Eliza Wright of Bolton, New York on October 3, 1839, and had eight children. He died on September 3, 1902, at his residence in Maquoketa after having a stroke, aged 90. He was a member of the Democratic Party.\n\n\n== References ==",

Christina Wood started the business as a pop-up in 2018, and relocated to a brick-and-mortar restaurant in partnership with Broadcast Coffee Roasters in 2020.\n\n\n== Description ==\nTemple Pastries is a bakery at the intersection of 26th and Jackson in Seattle's Central District, specializing in sourdough croissants and cruffins (croissant/muffin hybrids). Seasonal varieties of croissants have included salted caramel apple, chocolate hazelnut with orange zest sugar, and plum and cardamom. The bakery has also sold cakes, breads, cookies, croissant pretzels, breakfast sandwiches, macarons, sweet potato jam doughnuts, and coffee and espresso drinks. Breakfast sandwiches have bacon, cheddar cheese, and chives, or poblano, Swiss cheese, and mushroom, baked into eggs and served on a wheat bun. Among the macron varieties is Autumn Leaves, which has a white chocolate ganache infused with bay leaves, cinnamon, and peppercorns. Temple Pastries bakes using buckwheat, rye, and whole grain.\n\n\n== History ==\nChristina Wood started the business in July 2018, as a pop-up at farmers' markets and coffee shops. It is her first bakery. In 2019, the business and Broadcast Coffee Roasters partnered to open a cafe in 2020. Initially slated to open in September, Temple Pastries opened on October 23. In 2023, the bakery began producing select baked goods at the Broadcast Coffee on 65th Avenue Northeast and Roosevelt. The Central District location also expanded and announced plans to start offering pizza. \n\n\n== Reception ==\nCallie Craighead included the bakery in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer's 2021 list of the city's nine best doughnut shops. Megan Hill and Jade Yamazaki Stewart included Temple Pastries in Eater Seattle's 2022 overview of fifteen \"great places\" to eat in the Central District. The website's Harry Cheadle included the business in 2023 lists of Seattle's sixteen \"most perfect\" bakeries and best cafes for remote work. Stewart and Cheadle also included Temple Pastries in a 2024 list of thirteen Seattle eateries for \"amazing\" breakfast. Aimee Rizzo included the business in The Infatuation's 2024 overview of the city's best bakeries. Seattle Magazine and The Stranger have also included Temple Pastries in overviews of the city's best croissants.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of bakeries\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website",

It comprises most of her singles released from 2019 to 2023, beginning with \"Borderline\" and ending with its title track \"Personal\". It was released to streaming platforms on December 8, 2023.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nFlorrie announced via her social media that ahead of her debut album releasing on 2024, she would drop a compilation album that would include all her stand-alone singles released previously (with the exception of her 2020 single \"Butterflies\"), as she was ready to start a new chapter on her musical career.\nMusic videos were released for the singles \"Borderline\" and \"Communicate\". 'Borderline' was featured on the fifteen season of ABC hit medical drama series \"Grey's Anatomy\" on a crossover episode with the series \"Station 19\", in the episode \"What I Did For Love\". Meanwhile, the title track, \"Personal\" was played for the first time by Mollie King on BBC Radio 1 on 14 December 2023.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nReviewing the title track which was released the same day as the compilation, Jason Lipshutz from Billboard Magazine said that Florrie \"has provided a stocking stuffer for longtime fans with “Personal,” a deeply felt account of a dissolving relationship that still finds the strength to be molded into uplifting indie-pop\", as well pointing out that Arnold \"sounds assured in her craft and radiant in her delivery.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

According to the Handbook of Texas, the community had a population of 28 in 2000.\n\n\n== History ==\nEarly settler William Lambert named the community Red Hill for the red clay bank on Frazier's Creek, upon which it stands. A post office was established at Red Hill in 1878 and remained in operation until 1905. The community was said to have reached its zenith in 1884 because lumber and livestock were the two principal resources in the area, and also had saw and gristmills, three churches, and 130 residents. Most of the businesses moved closer to the railroad in 1890, causing the population to plunge to 30. It had a population between 20 and 40 throughout the 20th century. Only 20 people lived there in 1983 and were served by a town hall and two businesses. It remained at that level in 1990 and grew to 28 in 2000.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nRed Hill is located at the intersection of Texas State Highway 8 and Farm to Market Road 995, 8 mi (13 km) north of Linden and 12 mi (19 km) west of Atlanta in central Cass County.\n\n\n== Education ==\nRed Hill had its own school in 1884. Today, the community is served by the Linden-Kildare Consolidated Independent School District.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Agios Andreas railway station (Greek: Σιδηροδρομικός σταθμός Άγιος Ανδρέας, romanized: Sidirodromikos Stathmos Agios Andreas) is a railway station in Kato Achaia in the northwestern Peloponnese, Greece. The station is on the former Patras–Kyparissia line However Since the suspension of regional services on the metre-gauge railways of the Peloponnese in 2011, the station is used only by local Proastiakos trains, served by Proastiakos Patras P1 & P2 Services.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe station was opened in December 1887 as Pyrgos Station and was the second railway station built in of the city after the then central one of Agios Dionysios. The two stations were initially open-air and were not connected by a railway line. The line to connect them passed through the centre of the city and was built in 1888, after disputes from residents and a change of design. In the same year, the construction of the railway line to Pyrgos continued, up to Kato Achaia, and its operation began in December 1888, as well as the official operation of the station. In fact, the first route was made on 15 December 1888. Until the union of the lines Patras-Athens and Patras-Pyrgos, through the centre of the city, the station of Agios Andreas was the central station of the city to Pyrgos. Later it was connected to the now inactive Patras-Kyparissia metric railway line.\nIn 1970 OSE became the legal successor to the SEK, taking over responsibilities for most of Greece's rail infrastructure. On 1 January 1971, the station and most of Greek rail infrastructure were transferred to the Hellenic Railways Organisation S.A., a state-owned corporation. Freight traffic declined sharply when the state-imposed monopoly of OSE for the transport of agricultural products and fertilisers ended in the early 1990s. Many small stations of the network with little passenger traffic were closed down. \nIn 2005 operations from the station were suspended due to the reconstruction works of the OSE railway network in the region. In 2009, with the Greek debt crisis unfolding OSE's Management was forced to reduce services across the network. Timetables were cut back, and routes closed as the government-run entity attempted to reduce overheads. However in the station reopened on 9 July 2010 as part of the Proastiakos Patras service to Kato Achaia. In 2017 OSE's passenger transport sector was privatised as TrainOSE, currently, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane infrastructure, including stations, remained under the control of OSE.\nOn 29 February 2020, service's recommenced from the station to Rio. With the reconnection of Patras to Athens planned for 2025, Agios Andreas will be a connecting station of the line to Pyrgos. Service were suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic, becoming the starting point of (what would be) the new Line P1 of the Suburban Railway to the town of Kato Achaia. With the resumption of services on 4 July 2020, it was replaced as the starting point of northern leg of service by Agios Andreas. On 1 August 2023, line numbers were introduced on the Patras–Kyparissia railway, With Agios Andreas becoming an interchanged between P1 & P2 services.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nThe station is still housed in the original 19th-century brick-built station building; however, as of (2023) the station is unstaffed, with no staffed booking office and is rundown. There are no waiting rooms, however the platforms have shelters and seating. There are no Dot-matrix display departure and arrival screens or timetable poster boards on the platforms.\n\n\n== Services ==\nSince 1 August 2023, when line numbers were introduced, the following weekday services call at this station:\n\nPatras Suburban Railway Line P1 towards Kato Achaia, with one train every two hours from 07:00 to 17:00.Patras Suburban Railway Line P2 towards Rio, The trains run every hour daily, from 6:23 in the morning until 23:23 in the evening. Rail services are provided by OSE trains (Stadler GTW 2/6 diesel two-car units).Bus route 301 & 302 call at the nearest bus stop, on Maizonos. Agios Andreas, has two bus connections at Kastellokampos: one for Agios Vasileios, and another for the General University Hospital of Patras via the University of Patras.\n\n\n== Station layout ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Grudziądz Fortress or Fort Grudziądz is a system of Prussian forts, mainly from the 19th century, located in the area of Grudziądz and surrounding towns. The purpose of the fortress was to defend Grudziądz and the strategic bridge over the Vistula river in case of Russian attacks.\nIts central point is the Citadel, known by Germans as Courbière's Fortress (German: Feste Courbiere) – a stronghold in the northern part of the city, the construction of which began on 6 June 1776, on the order of King Frederick the Great of Prussia. Other forts were built at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries.\nMost of the fortifications were only used in 1806, 1807, and 1945. Many of them, including the Citadel, have been preserved to this day in good condition. Fragments of the fortifications are accessible to visitors.\n\n\n== Location and construction of the Citadel ==\nAfter the First Partition of Poland, Grudziądz fell within the borders of Prussia. There arose the need to secure the lower Vistula to protect the communication lines between Gdańsk Pomerania and Prussian lands on the right bank of the Vistula, especially since the fortresses in Gdańsk and Toruń were not yet in Prussian hands. The fortress was built on a vast plateau 1.5 km north of the city center, at the highest point of the Vistula escarpment (68.1 m above sea level, 60 meters above the level of the Vistula). It is surrounded on the north and east by the Osa river, and on the south by the Trynka Canal. Paul von Gontzenbach, who had previously worked on the construction of the fortress in Srebrna Góra in Silesia, is considered the designer, with the construction project personally corrected by King Frederick II.\nConstruction began on 6 June 1776, commemorated by a stone on the bergfried, and work progressed rapidly at the beginning of August. Von Gontzenbach had a sufficient supply of building materials and, most importantly, well-trained craftsmen and laborers at his disposal. Miners were brought in for digging underground tunnels. In June 1776, there were 6,918 people working on the fortress construction (besides carters), including 367 masons. The construction was supposed to last four years, but the fortress was not yet ready by 1782 due to several reasons. In 1780, there was a shortage of bricks. At that time, old Teutonic castles in Rogóźno and Grudziądz were dismantled for the needs of the fortress, and the foundations of both sides of Bastion I were built with stone. The constantly growing demand for bricks (11 million were used for the fortress construction, with a total of 608,400 m³ of masonry work) could only be met by the fortress's own brickworks. Therefore, the brickworks located south of the fortress were expanded, and 180 bricklayers were brought in, mostly from Prussia. In 1821, the brickworks were further enlarged, and new kilns were installed, but by the mid-19th century, it was already inactive. There were also technical difficulties in setting up terraces and ramps on the Vistula escarpment – numerous springs and streams flowing from the mountain made the work challenging. Additionally, some buildings had to be founded deeper than originally planned. According to von Gontzenbach's estimate, the construction of the fortress was to cost about 1,800,000 thalers. However, this estimate quickly proved unrealistic, even though construction of some of the previously planned anti-mine tunnels, designed to destroy siege works, was abandoned. Of the planned length of 56,400 meters, only 1,246 meters of tunnels were realized, and demolition mines were also laid under the bastion ramparts and ravelins, which were used to blow up their own fortifications if they were occupied by the enemy. The construction of the fortress was completed in 1789, with the final cost of its construction amounting to 3,671,146 thalers.\n\n\n== The period of the Napoleonic wars ==\nThe appearance of a patrol of Napoleon's army in Dragacz on 15 November 1806 caused panic in Grudziądz. Frederick William III and his wife hastily left the city, heading northeast.\nWilhelm René de l'Homme de Courbière, the governor of Grudziądz, was preparing to defend the fortress. At the beginning of the campaign, he had a garrison consisting of two battalions and two companies. By the end of 1806, the Prussian forces were augmented by three infantry battalions and one squadron of hussars, and additionally, the Citadel had strong artillery (154 cannons, 35 howitzers, and 16 mortars). In total, General Courbière had a garrison of 5,808 soldiers under his command, but it was not a homogeneous force – a significant portion consisted of Poles, Lithuanians, Ruthenians, and even Scots; this ethnic diversity caused significant problems for the Citadel's command.\nThe first encounter with the French forces took place on 4 December 1806, in Mniszek, after which there were no contacts with the enemy for a month.\n\n\n=== Siege of 1807 ===\n\nAt the beginning of January 1807, a unit of Polish insurgents led by Major Dominik Dziewanowski appeared on the left bank of the Vistula. They camped in Dragacz and began patrolling the Vistula's bank, but did not engage in any aggressive actions against the Prussians. In mid-January, the Hessian-Darmstadt Brigade arrived near Grudziądz and almost immediately launched an assault on the city. The Prussian forces defended only the northern edge of Grudziądz with a unit of 400 men and two cannons. The Prussians quickly ceased resistance and withdrew towards the Citadel, occupying field fortifications located nearby.\nAt the end of January, a company of infantry under the command of Captain Jan Barankiewicz appeared near Grudziądz, occupying Wielki Lubień. This unit served as a cover for the Polish forces under General Jan Henryk Dąbrowski. The appearance of Polish troops caused trouble for the Citadel's command, as Polish soldiers from the garrison began to desert. Sources mention the desertion of a non-commissioned officer and eight soldiers.\nAfter Russia entered the war and achieved temporary successes in East Prussia, the forces of the Grande Armée withdrew from the conquered territory. Although they returned near Grudziądz the next day, the city remained in the hands of the Prussians.\nThe desertions from the Prussian units were exacerbated by the arrival of the Polish 11th Infantry Regiment in Wielki Lubień, commanded by Colonel Józef Wasilewski with a force of 1,600 men. Soon, other Polish units began to gather in the vicinity of the city. Preparations for the assault slowly began. Supported by Hessian battalions, the Poles captured Grudziądz on February 11. However, the attempt to capture the Citadel itself failed. After February 12, the Legion of Kalisz under General Józef Zajączek arrived near Grudziądz. This marked the beginning of the proper blockade of the fortress. One battalion from the 2nd Polish Infantry Regiment of the Duchy of Warsaw and the first battalion from the 4th Infantry Regiment of the Duchy of Warsaw participated in the blockade.\nThe besieging forces were still too weak and practically devoid of artillery, so a direct assault was not feasible. They limited themselves to sporadic artillery duels. During one of these duels, the city itself suffered damage, including possibly the Klimek Tower on Castle Hill.\nEven before the arrival of spring in 1807, epidemics began to break out among the combatants. Over 700 defenders died as a result. As for the attackers, there is no data available. It is only known that from the end of April to mid-May, about 200 soldiers were lost from the Polish units due to various reasons. At least some of them died as a result of the epidemics.\nAfter the fall of Gdańsk, siege artillery was brought to Grudziądz, and intense preparations for the assault began. A rampart was started to be constructed from the northeast side of the Citadel, where cannons were to be placed. On June 27, the construction of another, closer rampart began. Three days later, just before the commencement of the general assault, a ceasefire was declared. The siege was halted upon news of the armistice following the Battle of Friedland (June 14), due to negotiations preparing for the Treaties of Tilsit. Under the Treaties of Tilsit, the areas of Grudziądz north of the Trynka Canal remained in Prussian hands. Grudziądz was one of the few Prussian fortresses that were not captured by the Napoleonic army.\n\n\n=== After the Congress of Vienna ===\nAfter the Napoleonic Wars, the Prussians did not undertake significant expansion works on the fortifications. Over time, the condition of the structures tended to degrade, especially in terms of defensive capabilities (some lunettes and certain ravelins were eliminated). The Citadel mainly served as barracks and warehouses, as well as a prison for political prisoners and a place of internment for Polish troops after the November Uprising, including Colonel Edmund Callier.\nOn 30 April 1862, a mutiny of Prussian soldiers of Polish nationality broke out under the command of Gotfryd Klatt, but it did not lead to significant consequences. In December 1870, Colonel Félix Gustave Saussier, a French prisoner of war, escaped from the citadel.\nBy government decision in 1872, the fortress was officially abolished. The fortification structures were used, among other things, for testing new types of cannons and ammunition. However, the function of the fortress was reinstated twice for the city: after the construction of a bridge over the Vistula river between 1876 and 1888, and on 1 September 1944, due to the approach of the Red Army.\nIn Grudziądz, there was the headquarters of the 35th Division of the German Empire (which was transferred to Toruń in 1912), as well as:\n\nHeadquarters of the 35th Cavalry Brigade (German: 35. Kavallerie-Brigade)\n4th Mounted Rifles Regiment (German: Jäger-Regiment zu Pferde Nr. 4)\nHeadquarters of the 35th Field Artillery Brigade (German: 35. Feldartillerie-Brigade)\n71st Field Artillery Regiment Groß-Komtur (German: Feldartillerie-Regiment Nr. 71 Groß-Komtur)\nLandwehr Inspection Graudenz\n\n\n== Interwar period ==\nIn 1919, Józef Wrycza, also known as the \"priest general\" (although officially holding the rank of podpolkovnik in the Polish Armed Forces), sentenced to death, was imprisoned here by the Germans.\nOn 23 January 1920, the fortress, along with the city, came under Polish control. In the first months after regaining independence, there was a proposal to demolish the Citadel, with the intention to employ the unemployed for the task, but it was never implemented.\nFrom 1920 to 1939, the fortress continued to be used for military purposes, despite the development of military technology and the emergence of, among other things, airplanes. Within the walls of the Grudziądz Citadel, the 18th Pomeranian Uhlan Regiment and the 16th Field Artillery Regiment were stationed, renamed in 1931 to the 16th Pomeranian Light Artillery Regiment. There were also military warehouses (the so-called Intendance Material Depot). Some buildings were used for the needs of the Cavalry Training Center.\nThe administration, maintenance, and modernization of the fortress facilities were the responsibility of the Grudziądz Fortification Office. The last head of the fortifications was Major Engineer Karol Wiliński.\n\n\n== World War II ==\n\nGrudziądz fell under German control on 4 September 1939. The Germans utilized the fortress as an experimental ground and also as warehouses. However, with the Eastern Front approaching, Hitler again declared the city a fortress to be defended to the end. For this purpose, two defense lines were established in advance: external and internal, incorporating former forts of the fortress camp. The core of the resistance was to be the Citadel. Soviets and Poles grouped in units of the 2nd Belarusian Front under the command of General Pavel Batov engaged in bloody battles for the city from the end of January until 5 March 1945. In the last days of January, the Fortress was encircled from all sides by troops. On February 14, General Fricke issued an order addressed to the residents, instructing them to leave the city and go to Dragacz. Few residents complied with it. In the second half of February, Soviet forces seized the suburbs of Grudziądz. The Nazis attempted to cause extensive destruction during their retreat, but some of their attempts were thwarted by the resistance movement. In early March, Soviet troops reached the city center. In some actions, other forts of the Fortress were utilized, such as Dąb and Strzemięcin, but the Citadel itself remained a rear base for occupying forces.\nGrudziądz was prepared from the beginning for an attack from the east, but the fortification system was outdated. German units were defeated and took refuge in the Citadel; however, realizing the futility of further resistance, Major General Ludwig Fricke signed the surrender document on March 6. The German troops left the Fortress in formation under the escort of Soviet soldiers. 117 officers and around 5,000 soldiers were taken prisoner. On that day, at 9:00 PM in Moscow, a twentyfold gun salute was fired to commemorate the capture of the city.\n\n\n== Citadel currently ==\n\nToday, the Citadel still serves as a military facility. Several smaller units are stationed there, and military warehouses are located on its premises. From the old fortress, the bergfried with its full circuit of walls and casemates has been preserved, along with both gates and one of the four ramps. Within the bergfried, the best-preserved and most characteristic feature is the two-story Great Warehouse, as well as the neoclassical former commandant's building located in the middle of the courtyard. Also, all five bastions, four ravelins, the footpath encircling the fortress in the counterscarp, and the countermine footpaths have been preserved, although in varying conditions. However, the former lunettes no longer exist. The dry moat is still in quite good condition. In some unused footpaths, approximately 1,000 bats have found shelter. The Citadel can be visited with prior permission from the military authorities or freely on selected days of the year (so-called \"Open Days of the Citadel,\" e.g., November 11 or May 3). Since June 2011, the facility has been managed by the Military Unit 4503. Guided tours of the Citadel are conducted by guides from the Military Cultural and Educational Association \"RAWELIN\".\n\n\n=== Trail through the fortifications ===\nAt the end of August 2007, a hiking and cycling trail leading to the most important fortifications was established. The route encircles Grudziądz, starting from Fort Strzemięcin and the adjacent shelter IR9, passing through Fort Lasek Miejski, the Anti-Tank Battery Leśny Dwór, Księże Góry, a shelter on Kasztanowa Street, Fort Tarpno, Świerkocin, Nowa Wieś, and Parski. The trail ends at the Citadel at the Rogowy Bastion. It was inaugurated on 2 September 2007, with the \"To the Courbière's Citadel\" cycling rally, which was attended by over 160 people. Guides from the Society of Friends of Fortifications led participants to the most significant fortification monuments, including the underground tunnels of the Citadel.\n\n\n== Hornwork of the Citadel ==\nA mighty structure built between 1788 and 1789 according to the design by Paweł von Gontzenbach. It constituted the so-called outer work of the Citadel, projecting towards the city. It also strengthened the defense of the Upper Gate approach with flanking fire. The core of the structure was the actual hornwork, consisting of two demi-bastions. Beyond the inner moat rose a mighty artillery traverse of the first defense section. Communication with the Citadel was ensured by a communication line – a covered road. The entire structure was surrounded by a moat, a scarp wall, a covered road, and a fighting slope. The network of anti-mine tunnels was significantly expanded. The Rogowy Bastion was partially blown up for brick salvage after World War II. However, numerous noteworthy objects and long stretches of underground tunnels have survived. The site is open to visitors, but caution is advised. Located between the present-day streets of Czwartaków, Saperów, and Jagiełły.\n\n\n== Other fortifications of the fortress ==\nFort Dąb\nFortifications of Kępa Forteczna\nFort Tarpno\nFort Świerkocin\nFort Nowa Wieś\nFort Parski\nNorth Battery\nFort Lesser Księża Góra\nFort Greater Księża Góra\nFort Strzemięcin\nSouthern Front Nizinny\nFort Gać\nFort Lasek Miejski\nFort Tuszewo\nHalf-track Battery Leśny Dwór\n\n\n=== Fort Dąb ===\n\nFort Dąb was the last infantry fort constructed before the outbreak of World War I (around 1907). It filled the gap between Księża Góra and Kępa Forteczna and served as protection for the entrance to the city from the Olsztyn side. Situated directly behind Tarpno lake and the initial section of Trynka Street (currently Makowa Street), the infantry shelter had a reinforced concrete structure, albeit weaker compared to previously built shelters. Its simple architecture resembled shelters from the World War I period. The fort's rampart housed three guardhouses with vaults reinforced with corrugated iron. In 1944, two Tobruk-type bunkers were also placed in the fort's rampart.\nThe fort's condition is good, and it is open for visitors. The main shelter is in good condition but lacks steel doors and shutters. Unlike other shelters in the inner ring, it was adapted for self-defense, with a latrine protruding in front of the facade to create a sort of caponier. The firing slits for frontal fire also protected the entrances to the shelter. The guardhouses are in good condition, with some retaining their corrugated iron vaults. The open space of the courtyard is filled with short sections of free-standing embankments.\n\nDuring the battles of Grudziądz in 1945, the fort served as an artillery concentration point for the northern sector of the city's defense and was used by the Germans in heavy fighting in this part of the city as a frontline resistance point.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Fortifications of Kępa Forteczna ===\n\n\n==== Fort Tarpno ====\nLocated beyond the intersection of roads leading to Olsztyn and Malbork, near Klonowa Street and close to allotment gardens, lies Fort Tarpno. The structure is well-preserved and was built between 1896 and 1898 to protect the strategic junction of roads to Malbork and Olsztyn. The barrack shelter is secured by a formidable 3-meter concrete vault. The earthen ramparts with four guardhouses (each intended for 12 soldiers) are only minimally damaged by encroaching plots. Inside the ramparts stands the barracks shelter, worth visiting due to its minimal degree of devastation, with bossages around the door and window openings. Architecturally, this shelter resembles Fort Lasek Miejski.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Fort Świerkocin ====\nBuilt between 1900 and 1902, this fort features a barracks shelter with slightly weaker construction compared to Fort Tarpno. The concrete-reinforced walls were 1.75 meters thick. It is surrounded by four guardhouses, including three reinforced with corrugated steel against splinters. A characteristic feature of the fort is the rear rampart consisting of short, oval sections of embankments. Well-preserved and located near the border of Nowa Wieś and Świerkocin, access is from Świerkocińska Street.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Fort Nowa Wieś ====\nThe fort built between 1900 and 1902 is architecturally identical to Fort Świerkocin and also has a rear rampart. Despite some damage, part of the main shelter has remained in fairly good condition. Inside, one can find equipment elements from the time of construction, such as the base for a diesel generator and inscriptions on the walls in German. The fort is located in Nowa Wieś near Grudziądz, on Leśna Street.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Fort Parski ====\nOn the prominent headland of Kępa Forteczna, Fort Parski was erected in 1900, consisting of a small infantry fort and an accompanying small shelter surrounded by an earth embankment. The thickness of the reinforced concrete floors was 1.75 meters. There were 3 guardrooms in the surrounding rampart. Currently open to visitors, it is fairly well preserved. The smaller shelter is well-preserved but closed. One of the guardrooms has a preserved ceiling reinforced with corrugated sheet metal.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== North Battery ====\nThe battery was situated north of the Citadel and had an earth construction. Only the ammunition niches and the shelters for the gun crews were made of concrete (with a weak, 10 cm thick wall). It was designed for 6 cannons of 100 mm caliber and was intended to provide direct protection for the Vistula river line. Currently in good condition, completely surrounded by earthworks. Out of the six crew shelters, only 2 are in ruins. On the right wing of the battery, there is a two-chamber ammunition shelter. In the battery's forefield, there is an observation shelter. In the rear field, there is another brick-and-concrete observation shelter with ruins of a tower and three observation openings.\n\n\n=== Fort Greater Księża Góra ===\nIn the years 1890–1891, 2 infantry bunkers and 1 ammunition bunker were built. Their construction was brick-concrete. The total thickness of the vaults was 320 mm. Each infantry shelter was designed for a maximum of 108 soldiers. In the years 1894–1896, another infantry bunker and an armored battery for four 150 mm howitzers were built. The howitzers could fire up to 4 shots per minute, up to a distance of 7.2 km. The battery was operated by 63 soldiers and officers. The infantry bunker, intended for 158 soldiers, was connected to the battery by an underground passage. Observers' towers for artillery observation were placed on both wings. Their armor thickness was 15 cm. In 1898, another concrete infantry shelter was erected, this time intended for up to 252 soldiers. At the top of the fort, an open earth battery was placed, capable of accommodating 6 cannons of 120 mm caliber. The complex of buildings was complemented by a 2-chamber sanitary shelter. The whole area was surrounded by a flat earthen rampart with a barbed wire network and a fortress grille. The length of the fort was approximately 600 m. The rampart was defended frontally by infantry fire and ten 53 mm cannons in portable armored towers (Fahrpanzer), placed in previously prepared crescent-shaped concrete positions. Access to the fortifications was from the current Droga Graniczna Street.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Fort Lesser Księża Góra ===\nIn 1892, an infantry bunker was built for 90 soldiers, made of brick and concrete. In 1898, a second infantry bunker was erected, this time made of concrete, which could accommodate 165 soldiers. Near the shelters, an earth battery was placed, capable of holding 6 guns of 90 mm caliber, as well as an earth battery for 6 guns of 120 mm caliber. The entire area was surrounded by a flattened rampart with a dense network of barbed wire. The fort was approximately 350 m long. For direct protection of the fort, two 2-chamber guardhouses for 34 soldiers and two guardhouses for 17 soldiers were placed in the rampart, as well as four concrete positions for 53 mm Fahrpanzers. Access to the fortifications was from the present Droga Graniczna Street.\n\n\n=== Fort Strzemięcin ===\nOn the high bank of the Vistula river near the no longer existing Strzemięcin folwark, large-scale fortification works began at the end of the 19th century. The emerging structures were intended to secure both the land and water approaches to the city from the south. The first to be built was a brick and earth fort, now in a state of advanced ruin. In its immediate vicinity are guardhouses, of which only two have been fully preserved. During a visit, one may come across a dry moat, retaining walls, and even posts with visible barbed wire in several places, as well as an artillery battery consisting of mobile guns in turrets (Fahrpanzer). The Strzemięcin fortifications were only used in combat once, in 1945. At that time, a German garrison under the command of Captain Friedhausen, consisting of 8 officers and 102 soldiers, resisted Soviet forces for several days while surrounded, until running out of ammunition. The Strzemięcin complex is one of the oldest and largest fortifications of its kind in the vicinity of the city. The fort is located on the present-day Zachodnia Street.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Southern Front Nizinny ===\n\nIt consisted of Forts Gać and Lasek Miejski, positioned on both sides of the road to Radzyń Chełmiński, with the Semi-Armored Battery Leśny Dwór behind them, located behind the battery's ammunition shelter (currently Żwirki Street), two positions for 57 mm Fahrpanzers on both sides of the road, and Fort Tuszewo situated between Fort Gać and Księża Góra. The task of the Southern Front Nizinny was to defend the southern part of the city, lacking significant natural defenses. Next to the battery, on its right wing, you can see an aerial target trap, built in 1940, used to check the accuracy of machine guns installed in Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighter planes undergoing maintenance at nearby aircraft factories.\n\n\n==== Fort Gać ====\nThe fort was located on the eastern side of the road. It was equipped with a powerful bunker for 280 soldiers. Safety was ensured by 2.5-meter walls and a 3-meter ceiling. It was surrounded by a rampart and guard posts. After the war, it was completely demolished, and currently, blocks of the Lotnisko housing estate are located on its site. One Tobruk-type shelter has been preserved in the vicinity of the Complex of General Education Schools No. 5, along with a small fragment of the fort's rampart neck. Architecturally, it was similar to the twin Fort Lasek Miejski.\n\n\n==== Fort Las Miejski ====\nThe fort, located on the western side of the road to Radzyń, was equipped with a powerful bunker for 280 soldiers, featuring 2.5-meter walls and a 3-meter ceiling designed to withstand hits from 420 mm caliber shells. Situated in Las Miejski, the ramparts are currently well-preserved, with remnants of stakes in the moat for securing barbed wire. The infantry shelter has a blown-out facade, presenting an impressive ruin that effectively showcases the structure of the building. The left and middle guard posts are well-maintained, while the right guard post was likely unfinished, lacking the reinforcing corrugated iron ceiling. The fort is open to visitors on Kasprowicz Street.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Fort Tuszewo ====\nThe fort was constructed between 1905 and 1906 with the purpose of filling the gap between Fort Gać and Księże Góry. Presently, the main shelter and guard posts are completely demolished, but the frontal rampart remains intact.\n\n\n==== Half-track Battery Leśny Dwór ====\n\nThe battery was built between 1898 and 1899 on a dune. It is similar to the battery at Strzemięcin and the southern front of the fortress in Toruń. The battery, constructed of reinforced concrete, was designed for coastal artillery batteries. It could accommodate 3 flat-trajectory guns with a caliber of 105 mm in armored turrets. The armor thickness of the turrets was 8 cm at the front and top, and 4 cm at the rear. The guns had a firing rate of 9 rounds per minute. The range of fire with a regular grenade was 10.8 km, with shrapnel shell 8.5 km, and with grapeshot 0.6 km. The weight of the turret was 19 tons. The turrets could rotate 360 degrees. They were protected from the front by a concrete parapet, a flat rampart, and a shallow moat equipped with barbed wire and a fortress grille. Ammunition depots and crew quarters were located in the parapet and transverse sections. An open concrete observation post was located on the right flank, while an observation post in an immovable armored tower was located on the left flank. The wall thickness of the tower made of nickel steel was 10 cm.\nThe battery's crew consisted of: 1 officer, 8 non-commissioned officers, 37 gunners, and 4 observers. Currently, the battery is fairly well preserved and open to visitors. The gun turrets and the observation dome on the left wing (which was blown up) are missing. An open observation post is located nearby, in the vicinity of Żwirki Street in Grudziądz.\n\n\n=== Defensive bridge in Grudziądz ===\n\nThe bridge, which was 1.092 km long, had 11 spans, each 97 meters long. The railway track had a width of 4.4 meters, while the road was 6 meters wide. It accommodated railway tracks of a line connecting (in Laskowice) two strategic lines: Bydgoszcz-Tczew-Kaliningrad and Poznań-Toruń-Wystruć. The bridge was constructed for 5,386,000 marks by the Eastern Railway between 1876 and 1879. The construction was supervised by the construction counselor Souche. On the western abutment, there were two single-story brick blockhouses prepared for circular defense, along with a double gate between them; on the eastern abutment, there was only one gate on pillar X. Mine chambers were formed in pillars IX and X.\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n\n=== Nomenclature of the fortress' elements ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nTwierdza Grudziądz.

        "content": "The series of paintings for the alameda of the Dukes of Osuna comprises seven pictures painted by Francisco de Goya between 1786 and 1787. The country estate of the dukes and duchesses, who were the painter's mecenas and friends, was known as El Capricho, and was located on the outskirts of Madrid.\nThe whole group of works is closely related to the tapestry cartoons —especially in the colors used and in the lighting panorama—, whose fifth series Goya completed shortly before tackling this project. By then, the Aragonese artist was a reputed artist at court and had already forged a good image for himself in Madrid's wealthy circles.\nThe works passed into the possession of the Marquesa de Montellano Collection, which also houses other works by Goya, where they remain to this day.\nThey should not be confused with other pictures painted by the artist, also for the Dukes of Osuna, in the nineties. Although they also adorned the country house of the dukes, critics have coincided in naming this series as \"the dream of reason\" due to the witchcraft themes it presents.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Countess of Benavente and Duchess of Osuna, María Josefa Pimentel and her husband, Duke Pedro de Alcántara Téllez-Girón y Pacheco, were one of the most cultured and active couples in Madrid's enlightened circles. Goya, who counted among his friends Leandro Fernández de Moratín and Juan Meléndez Valdés, was a member of these circles.\nUpon contacting the painter, the dukes were impressed by the ease with which he made the cartoons and, after establishing a close friendship, their now patrons asked him to make a series of paintings to decorate their villa. The Aragonese accepted and began the execution of the works for the Alameda de Osuna after finishing his fifth series of cartoons.\nOn April 22, 1787, the paintings were transferred from the house of Goya, credited as \"Juan Goya\" on the invoice, to the Osuna villa. The painter received 22,000 reales for the works and for a lost portrait of the dukes' children. A certain Joaquín Gómez was in charge of paying Goya for his work.\n\n\n== Analysis ==\n\nThe dukes commissioned Goya to paint canvases with themes similar to those that the Aragonese artist had treated in the cartoons he delivered to the Royal Tapestry Factory of Santa Barbara. In spite of this, this series has serious aesthetic differences with the cartoons. The figures are smaller, accentuating the theatrical and rococo character of the landscape. Goya can prove here his knowledge of the Sublime Terrible, a trend defined years before by Mengs.\nBut above all there is violence in these paintings, which differs drastically from the inoffensive atmosphere of the cartoons. The greatest example of this is The Fall, where a woman suffers injuries after falling from a tree. In Stagecoach Hijacking, a man is seen wounded by a gunshot while a group of robbers assaults the car's passengers.\nIn the painting The Moving of a Stone, the workday of a group of humble workers is detailed. Concern for the lower classes is one of the main characteristics of pre-Romanticism, whose ideals Goya had assimilated through contact with enlightened artists such as Jovellanos. The first painting that refers to this facet of the painter is The Drunken Mason.\nThroughout the series, rural themes prevail, calm and friendly, similar to those of the cartoons. The chromatic range is harmonious and pleasant, although Goya, according to Glendinning, believes that scenes of country leisure should be left for the residences located on the outskirts of large cities.\nThe same scenery is presented that Goya depicted in his works for the Royal Factory: the banks of the Manzanares and its surroundings. But the fact that violence breaks out in some scenes of this series places both sets at extreme poles.\nLa cucaña is solidly linked to Goya's works such as The Kite and some of French neoclassicism. For its part, Stagecoach Hijacking evokes The Fight at the Venta Nueva, as both introduce a note of violence in the midst of a pleasant landscape. It was the second most expensive painting in the series (3000 reales), although it is smaller than The Moving of a Stone and Village Procession (2500 reales).\nBy depicting workers of low social status in his paintings, Goya emphasizes their vices, perhaps implying that they are the cause of their inferior position in modern society.\nThis elitism appears again in Village Procession, a painting that shows a popular Spanish custom rooted in the villages, but which had been disdained by the Enlightenment. Charles III banned them in 1777, but the measure had little effect in rural areas. Goya treats here with little respect the mayor and most of the provincial rich, who appear physically deformed.\n\nThe English critic recognizes in The Snowstorm and The Injured Mason —as well as his sketch, the aforementioned The Drunk Mason— undertaken at that time, the most direct precedents of these canvases. For the first time the artist introduces in his cartoons —which until then were cheerful and festive compositions— a note alluding to \"dangers\", which suggests that the painter no longer believes in the current picturesque style and wishes to separate himself from the customs imposed in the cartoons.\nThe Swing has its parallel in a tapestry cartoon made a decade earlier. But here, as in the whole series, the brushstroke is more vigorous and does not delve into the details, unlike the tapestries.\nLa cucaña and Village Procession represent scenes of rural Spain, both strongly rooted in 18th century iconography. In Village Procession, the blurred brushstrokes allow for a maximum appreciation of Spanish patron saint festivals, so common in the twilight of the century.\nStagecoach Hijacking is the most complex of Goya's compositions for El Capricho. It mitigates the violent effect of the robbery through the arrangement of the figures, the composition and the chromaticism. The tonalities of the landscape contrast with the gravity of the robbery, which is pushed into the background by Goya's placement of the corpse in the lower left corner. Clearly, it is the assailants who are the main protagonists of the scene. Despite this, two thirds of the canvas are dedicated to portraying the landscape of limpid sky and lush vegetation, with the lower third dedicated to capturing the moment of the robbery.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Drunk Mason\nFrancisco Goya's tapestry cartoons\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBozal, Valeriano (2005).

        "content": "The 2024 CONCACAF Nations League final was a soccer match to determine the winner of the 2023–24 CONCACAF Nations League. The match was the third final of the CONCACAF Nations League, an international tournament contested by the men's national teams representing the member associations of CONCACAF, which covers North America, Central America, and the Caribbean.\nThe United States defeated Mexico 2–0 to claim the title for the third straight time.\n\n\n== Venue ==\nThe match was played at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, United States.\n\n\n== Route to final ==\nNote: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away; N: neutral site).\n\n\n=== United States ===\nThe United States were the defending champions of the Nations League after winning it back-to-back in 2021 and 2023 to Mexico and Canada respectively.\nThe Americans opened their defense of the Nations League title having to secure a two-legged quarter-final win against Trinidad & Tobago to advance to both the CONCACAF Nations League Finals and to qualify to the 2024 Copa América, which was hosted on home soil. The first leg was played on 16 November 2023 in the Q2 Stadium in Austin, Texas. The match ended up in a 3-0 victory for the United States with late goals from Ricardo Pepi, Antonee Robinson and Giovanni Reyna, which gained them a three-goal-lead before playing the second leg. Four days later, on the Hasely Crawford Stadium, Port Spain, the Americans got shocked by the Soca Warriors, which defeated them 2-1 in a match which was initially won by the visitors after an Antonee Robinson goal in the 25th minute which gave them a lead that was later reverted with two goals from Reon Moore and Alvin Jones in the 43th and 57th minute respectively. Nevertheless, the aggregate was 4-2 in favour of the Americans, which gave them the pass to both the CONCACAF Nations League Finals and the Copa América, whilst Trinidad and Tobago had to gain his pass to the latter tournament against Canada.\nThe United States earned a 3–1 victory against Jamaica in the semifinal played in AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, in a match they were initially losing by a Greg Leigh header that struck into Matt Turner's left top corner after just 33 seconds. The Americans could only get an equalizer 95 minutes after, when a corner kick was headed by Miles Robinson but deflected on Cory Burke into Andre Blake's goal, which led the game into extra time, in which Reyna, who was subbed on at half-time, assisted Haji Wright, who was subbed on in the 63rd minute, two times in the 96th and 109th minute to put the United States into its third consecutive Nations League final.\n\n\n=== Mexico ===\nThis was Mexico's second Nations League final, having lost the 2021 edition against the United States 3-2. In the 2023 edition, Mexico were eliminated in the semi-finals by the United States 3-0, though Mexico went on to win 3rd place after defeating Panama 1-0.\nEl Tri's 2024 campaign started against Honduras in the quarter-finals. That first leg was played in the Estadio Nacional Chelato Uclés, in Tegucigalpa, in which Honduras shocked Mexico, defeating them 2-0 with goals from Anthony Lozano and Bryan Róchez, which required Mexico to avenge the result at home or else fail to qualify for both the 2024 Nations League Finals and the 2024  Copa América. Four days later, the second quarter-final leg took place in the Estadio Azteca, Ciudad de México. Mexico dominated the match from the beginning, but couldn't score until Luis Chávez converted a free kick in the 43rd minute, followed by a crucial late equalizer in the aggregate in the 10th minute of stoppage time in the second half by Edson Álvarez. That led the game into extra time and eventually penalties, in which Mexico prevailed by 4-2, assuring its qualification to the semi-finals.\nMexico defeated Panama 3-0 in the semifinal played in the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, with the latter controlling the majority of the game and having more possession than El Tri, but failing to capitalize on its chances and eventually conceding three times with Edson Álvarez, Julián Quiñones and Orbelín Pineda scoring to guide Mexico into the second Nations League final in its history.\n\n\n== Match ==\n\n\n=== Summary ===\nMexico arrived to the final missing Julián Araujo which suffered an injury in the previous match against Panama and was thus replaced by Jorge Sánchez, which was the only change in the starting lineup on the final in relation to the one from the semi-final match. As with the starting lineup from the past match, Jaime Lozano was widely criticized for choosing América's Henry Martín instead of young Feyenoord top scorer Santiago Giménez. The United States recovered Sergiño Dest, who was suspended due to a double yellow received during the second leg of the quarter-final match against Trinidad & Tobago on 20 November 2023. Tyler Adams was announced to be in the starting XI which marked his return to the USMNT after being ruled out due to a year-long hamstring injury. Tim Ream returned to the starting XI after being replaced by Miles Robinson in the match against Jamaica and, after their performance against the latter, Giovanni Reyna and Haji Wright replaced both Malik Tillman and Folarin Balogun.\nThe match started with United States controlling the ball and the majority of the possession, which nearly materialized in the 5th minute when Christian Pulisic controlled the ball in the penalty area and could get past César Montes and Johan Vázquez to end up making a close-range shot which was saved by Guillermo Ochoa. Mexico's most prominent attack came in the 22th minute when Jesús Gallardo attempted a throw-in into the United States penalty area that, after a header, landed in Luis Chávez's feet and made a weak shot at the right of Matt Turner which was controlled. In the 38th minute, Sergiño Dest attempted a solo run in which he dribbled Luis Chávez and Érick Sánchez and attempted a long-range shot which past upon the crossbar. Right before half-time, in the 45th minute, Tyler Adams attempted a long range shot which struck right into Ochoa's right top corner to make it 1-0 for the United States, and entered half time leading the score. \nGregg Berhalter made a substitution at half, subbing off Adams and bringing onto the field Johnny Cardoso. The match continued to be a United States monologue, which frustrated Mexican players which had to draw upon several fouls to gain possession back, this resulted in Johan Vázquez, Edson Álvarez and Uriel Antuna gaining a yellow card in an 8-minute span between the 55th and the 63rd minute. Mexico's second attack in the whole match came in the 61st minute, when a long ball from Ochoa landed in the three-quarter line and was headed by Hirving Lozano to Henry Martín which controlled the ball to the edge of the goal area and shot it wide. The second goal from the United States came two minutes after, when Christian Pulisic dribbled his way into the penalty area and his cross was rejected by Vázquez only for Giovanni Reyna to intercept the ball and struck it from the edge of the penalty and putting it in Ochoa's right bottom corner. Immediately after the 2-0, Jaime Lozano brought onto the field Santiago Giménez and Orbelín Pineda for Uriel Antuna and Érick Sánchez respectively, whilst Berhalter replaced Haji Wright with Folarin Balogun. In the 71st minute, Giménez fell in the area at the same time Antonee Robinson cleared the ball near his chest, which gained Mexico a penalty that was later revised by the VAR and issued Giménez a yellow card for simulating the foul. The rest of the match the United States handed possession for a while, which gave Mexico the opportunity of making a few shots on goal that went wide. In the 88th minute, another close range shot was saved by Ochoa, this time from Johnny. After having to stop the match several times due to homophobic chants, the match was ended in the 99th minute, after only adding up 6 minutes. Giovanni Reyna was awarded the man of the match.\n\n\n=== Details ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"We Don't Trust You\" is a song by American rapper Future and American record producer Metro Boomin. It was released through Freebandz (under the business name Wilburn Holding Co.), Boominati Worldwide, Epic Records, and Republic Records as the opening track from their collaborative studio album of the same name on March 22, 2024. Produced by Metro and Prince85 and additionally produced by D. Rich, the three wrote the song with Future, while Chris Xz also additionally produced it even though he did not help write it.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nMichael Saponara of Billboard ranked \"We Don't Trust You\" as the best song on its titular album. Saponara thought that Future was taking shots at his previous collaborator, Drake who was feuding with Metro Boomin.\nWriting for Clash, Robin Murray stated that the song \"opens the record on a note of paranoia, the chirruping snare trills emanating menacingly in the background\". HipHopDX's Scott Glasher described the song as \"a slow burning trap by numbers heater\".\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

He was consecrated in 2024 as bishop suffragan of the Diocese of Mid-America in the Reformed Episcopal Church and the Anglican Church in North America. He is also dean of Cranmer Theological House, the diocesan seminary, and dean of the diocesan cathedral, the Church of the Holy Communion in Dallas.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nCamlin was born in 1964 in Georgetown, South Carolina. He grew up in a Baptist family. Camlin worked as a real estate broker in his 20s and early 30s, when he married the former Brett Altman. In the mid-1990s, after the birth of the first of their three children, he sensed a call to ordained ministry and obtained his B.A. at Southeastern Baptist Theological College and his Th.M. from Dallas Theological Seminary.After the move to Dallas, Camlin also began teaching in K-12 schools and began to be drawn toward Anglicanism at the Church of the Holy Communion under then-rector Ray Sutton. His Baptist ordination was regularized by Sutton in 2003. Camlin was youth director at Church of the Holy Communion before being called to Holy Trinity Church in Fairfax, Virginia, where he was vicar and then rector from 2005 to 2014. At that time, he returned to Dallas as assistant rector of Holy Communion, being appointed rector and dean in 2017.Camlin also held academic posts in K-12 schools and Reformed Episcopal Church seminaries. He was assistant professor of New Testament at Reformed Episcopal Seminary, and when he returned to Dallas, he was a lecturer at Cranmer House before his appointment as dean in 2022, the year he completed his Ph.D. in theology at Middlesex University.In 2023, Sutton called for the election of a second bishop suffragan in the Diocese of Mid-America, and Camlin was elected. His election was granted consent by the Anglican Church in North America college of bishops in January 2024, and Foley Beach and Ray Sutton consecrated him a bishop on March 21, 2024, at the Church of the Holy Communion.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nProfile on cathedral website",

        "content": "The first inauguration of Kassym-Jomart Tokayev as the president of Kazakhstan took place on Wednesday, 12 June 2019, at the Independence Palace in Nur-Sultan. The event marked the formal commencement of President Tokayev's five-year term, following a historic and peaceful transition of power for the first time in Kazakhstan's history. This transition occurred after Tokayev emerged victorious in the 2019 presidential election, succeeding Nursultan Nazarbayev, who resigned from office in March 2019. Prior to his inauguration, Tokayev had served as acting president.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn 19 March 2019, Nursultan Nazarbayev, the then-president of Kazakhstan, announced his resignation from office, following nearly three decades of leadership. In accordance with constitutional provisions, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, who was serving as the chairman of the Senate of Kazakhstan, assumed temporary duties to fulfill the remainder of Nazarbayev's presidential term. Tokayev officially took the oath of office in front of both houses of the Parliament on 20 March 2019, thereby assuming the role of acting president. Among Tokayev's initial actions upon assuming office was the decision to call for a snap presidential election in April 2019, in which Tokayev himself participated in the race as the leading candidate to succeed Nazarbayev.\nIn the 2019 presidential election, Tokayev secured a victory with over 71% of the vote, according to both preliminary results and exit polls. However, the election was not without controversy, particularly regarding allegations of electoral irregularities and lack of genuine competition.\n\n\n== Planning ==\nThe inauguration of the President of Kazakhstan follows a specific schedule as outlined in Article 42, Section II of the Constitution. Ordinarily, it occurs on the second Wednesday of January. However, deviations from this schedule may occur under certain circumstances:\n\nIf the President is elected through early elections or assumes acting presidency as stipulated in Article 48, Section II of the Constitution, the inauguration ceremony must take place within one month from the date of publication of the presidential election results or assumption of presidential powers.\nIn such cases, the specific date for taking the oath of office is determined by the Central Election Commission (CEC).\nFollowing his victory in the 2019 election, Tokayev announced during the Aqorda press conference on 10 June 2019 that the presidential inauguration would take place on 12 June, emphasizing the urgent need for working visit travel to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan for \"major international events\". However, Tokayev also made it clear that the CEC needed to complete the task of summarizing the preliminary election results and publishing an official final report by that time. That same day, the CEC announced final results, officially confirming Tokayev's win and thus becoming the president-elect.\n\n\n== Pre-inaugural events ==\nBefore the inauguration commenced, the Palace of Independence in the capital of Nur-Sultan resonated with ceremonial music at 10:46 UTC+6, setting a solemn and dignified tone. Additionally, the Kazakh flag, constitution, and presidential standard were methodically and formally introduced into the hall, adhering to established protocols and emphasizing their symbolic importance in the proceedings.\n\n\n== Inaugural events ==\n\n\n=== Ceremony ===\nAt 11:04 UTC+6, former president Nursultan Nazarbayev entered the halls of the Palace of Independence who was then accompanied by his successor Kassym-Jomart Tokayev to take the stage.\n\nKairat Mami, chairman of the Constitutional Council, then administered the oath of office to Tokayev, who then at 11:07 UTC+ placed his right hand to the Constitution and solemnly recited the oath in Kazakh: \"I solemnly swear that I will faithfully serve the people of Kazakhstan, strictly observe the Constitution and laws of the Republic of Kazakhstan, guarantee the rights and freedoms of citizens, conscientiously perform the high duties of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan entrusted to me.\"Following the oath, Tokayev reverently kissed the Kazakh flag.\nAfter being sworn, the inauguration ceremony proceeded outside of Palace of Independence to the Qazaq Eli Square at 11:09 UTC+6, where cannon salutes resounded as the Menıñ Qazaqstanym national anthem played with five-gun cannons being fired in honor of the head of state's mandate, as a symbol for the five-year presidential term. And during the performance of the anthem, the 21-gun salute was sounded as part of an international norm. It was observed that during the inauguration, military personnel were seen raising the flag over the Aqorda Presidential Palace as the national anthem played, a notable procedure observed which was absent during the 2015 inauguration of Nursultan Nazarbayev.\nAfter the national anthem, Tokayev was presented with the president's certificate, badge, and standard by Berik Imaşev, the chairman of the Central Election Commission.\n\n\n==== Inaugural address ====\nTokayev commenced his inauguration speech from 11:15 UTC+6, expressing gratitude to the voters who supported him in the election. He emphasized that the election was conducted in a manner that he deemed fair and \"in accordance with democratic principles,\" stating, \"My ultimate goal is to protect the interests of every citizen. I will not allow anyone or anything to drive a wedge between us, based on a difference of political views or positions.\" From there, he outlined key priorities, including continuing the strategic direction set by former president Nursultan Nazarbayev, addressing social issues, supporting entrepreneurship, ensuring societal unity, and defending national interests. Tokayev delineated his priorities under 10 directions, which encompassed ensuring economic growth, eradicating corruption, reforming the judicial and law enforcement systems, creating new jobs, solving the housing problem, implementing fair social policies, promoting regional development, upholding spiritual values, maintaining a balanced foreign policy, and empowering the youth. Additionally, Tokayev unveiled the establishment of the National Council of Public Trust as a platform for inclusive dialogue and participation of all segments of society in decision-making processes. Tokayev reaffirmed Kazakhstan's commitment to a balanced foreign policy and expressed confidence in overcoming challenges for national prosperity under his leadership.\n\n\n=== Parade ===\nAfter the swearing-in ceremony, Tokayev exited the Palace of Independence hall at 11:30 UTC+6, greeted by applause from the guests, and made his way to Qazaq Eli Square. The solemn procession of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Kazakhstan began at 11:32 UTC+6, showcasing the Kazakhstan's military strength and dedication to security. In his role as the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, Tokayev observed the parade alongside Defense Minister Nurlan Ermekbaev. Finally, at 11:40 UTC+6, the ceremony concluded with a parade of the Armed Forces.\n\n\n== Guests ==\nThe inauguration ceremony was attended by approximately 2,500 people, comprising a diverse array of dignitaries and representatives. Among the attendees were the First President of Kazakhstan – Elbasy Nursultan Nazarbayev, parliamentary deputies, members of the government, Supreme Court judges, and members of the Constitutional Council. Additionally, representatives from various governmental bodies such as the Presidential Administration, the Office of the Prime Minister, and the Central Election Commission were present. The ceremony also welcomed members of the Assembly of People of Kazakhstan, religious leaders, and regional akims. Notably, presidential candidates, Nur Otan party leadership, and members of national and regional public staff participated in the event, alongside representatives from non-governmental organizations, media outlets, and business communities. Prominent public figures from the fields of science, culture, and art, as well as leaders of Kazakh youth organizations, were also present in the inauguration.\nIt was also noted that the inauguration ceremony marked a significant departure from tradition as it held without the presence of foreign guests. The ceremony exclusively welcomed the diplomatic representatives accredited in Kazakhstan, representing a departure from previous inaugurations that often hosted international dignitaries.\n\n\n== See also ==\nKazakh presidential inauguration\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKassym-Jomart Tokayev inaugurated as President of Kazakhstan at the Aqorda official website\nStatement from Kassym-Jomart Tokayev Official Inauguration Ceremony of the Elected President of Kazakhstan at the Aqorda official website",

The bell tower was launched on November 22, 2011.\nThe current monument replaced the martyrs’ statues, which stood in front of the Miguel de Benavides Library (referred to then as the UST Central Library) until 2005. The old martyrs' statues, designed by Leonardo Hidalgo, were built during the rectorship of Norberto Castillo. They were erected in honor of Lorenzo Ruiz and the nine martyrs from the UST Ecclesiastical Faculties during the Spanish period. The nine Dominican martyrs were Antonio Gonzalez, Domingo de Erquicia, Lucas Del Espiritu Santo, Tomas Hioji de San Jacinto, Guillaume Courtet, Vicente Liem de la Paz, Domingo Henares, Jose Ma. Diaz Sanjurjo, and Pedro Almato. The statues were made up of steel frames patched up with cement.\n\n\n== Design ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "International Day of Rural Women was implemented by the United Nations General Assembly, and is celebrated every year on October 15, with the aim of highlighting the role and situation of women in rural areas.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first International Day of Rural Women was celebrated on 15 October 1995, and was promoted and organized by the WWSF (Women's World Summit Foundation). Ten years later, the United Nations General Assembly officially adopted the date with the signing of Resolution 62/136 on December 18, 2007.\n\n\n== Concept of Rural Women ==\nA rural woman is any female person who lives and works in a rural area.  Most of them depend on natural resources and agriculture for their livelihoods, and are often farmers, entrepreneurs or formal or informal agricultural workers.Despite being 25% of the world's population and 43% of the world's agricultural workforce, only 20% of landowners are women; women encounter more obstacles than men in accessing financial services, social protection and trade unions, and their salaries are on average 40% lower than those of men.Many of them live in areas where access to health services, water and education is scarce and although they play an important role within their communities, they are subject to laws and social norms that discriminate against them and substantially reduce their participation in decision-making processes.Among the tasks they perform are producing, processing, and selling agricultural products. In addition, they do household chores, look after the family and the community without any kind of remuneration.\n\n\n== Objectives ==\nCelebrated for the first time in 2008, after official recognition by the UN, it promotes and recognizes the role that rural women play in food security and the eradication of rural poverty and, consequently, are essential for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals defined by the United Nations.At the same time, it seeks to raise awareness and alert the community to their situation and the difficulties they face.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External Links ==\nUN - International Day of Rural Women\nInternational Day of Rural Women (2020)",

It is mainly used in English-speaking countries, especially in the United States.\nThe mineral classification used by the International Mineralogical Association is the Nickel-Strunz classification.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe classification of minerals was based on chemical composition by Dana in the fourth edition (1854, in two volumes) of his book System of Mineralogy. For the 20th century, this classification was completed thanks to scientific progress, particularly in the field of crystallography. In 1941, Karl Hugo Strunz used it to construct his classification. Dana's original classification was further developed, and a new classification was published in 1997.\n\n\n== Classification structure ==\nMinerals are arranged in a hierarchical system. Each mineral has a classification number, made up of four numbers separated by dots, enabling unambiguous identification even when minerals are known by several names (synonymy). The first number represents the mineral class. The second number represents the mineral type, in some cases taking into account its atomic structure. The third number represents a group of minerals of similar structure. The fourth number gives the unambiguous identification of the mineral.\n\n\n== Example ==\nKieserite group.\n\n29.

        "content": "Vincenzo Maria Battista (5 October 1823–14 November 1873) was an Italian composer and conductor. At first his operas were received with enthusiasm by his compatriots. Today none of his works are in the repertoire of any opera companies, despite the fact that in his lifetime they were performed in the most important theatres in Italy.\n\n\n== Life ==\nVincenzo (he preferred Vincenzio) Battista was born in Naples in Italy in 1823 - although it may actually have been 1818. He studied at the Conservatorio di Musica San Pietro a Majella in  Naples. His first work to be performed was the tragic opera Anna la Prie at the  Teatro Nuovo in Naples in February 1843. This was an instant success and audiences marvelled that it could have been written by a 19 year old. Rumours spread that he was older, or that the work had actually been composed by his supposed teacher, a monk called Guidi. His next success was the innovative opera Margherita d'Aragona (1844), at the Teatro di San Carlo with the soprano Fanny Goldberg, the tenor Gaetano Fraschini and the baritone Filippo Coletti. The Milan based bi-weekly magazine Il Pirata in its review praised each song and each singer and documented how many times Battista was called out by the enthusiastic audience. However, a long and detailed article in Museo di Scienze e Letteratura was less enthusiastic, claiming that Battista was being inspired by the wrong role models, a possible reference to Verdi.\nBy now his fame was spreading, and his next work, Rosvina de la Forest (1845), was commissioned by La Scala in Milan. His opera Eleonora Dori (1847) had a book by the leading librettist Salvadore Cammarano. Marietta Brambilla created the title role in his opera Irene (1847), while the soprano Balbina Steffenone sang in the première of his Giovanna di Castiglia at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples in 1863.\nHe set to music Canto V of Dante’s Inferno adapting it to the soprano tessitura.\n\n\n== Later years ==\nBattista seems to have suffered the same problem as many other prodigies - an overinflated sense of his own worth. In the salons of Naples Battista would often sing his own salon music with great enthusiasm, much to the amusement of audiences. In addition, an affectionate review of his work in Napoli Musicale commented on his lack of in-depth musical training.\nIn his last years Battista was living in poverty as interest in his operas waned owing to the increasing popularity of the works of Verdi and the refusal of Casa Ricordi to publish his later scores. Various of his friends blamed the changing tastes of opera goers and his being ignored by the publisher Casa Ricordi and tbe management of the Teatro San Carlo for his penury and his early death. He died after suffering an apoplectic fit during the rehearsals of a church piece at the Chiesa di San Potito in his native Naples in November 1873 aged 50 or 55. He was survived by three older unmarried sisters. He never married.\nThe Gazzetta Musicale di Milano (owned by Casa Ricordi) did not give him a separate obituary; instead reporting his passing between reports of a colder than usual winter in Naples and the appointment of a new concert master.\n\n\n== Selected operas ==\nAnna la Prie (1843)\nMargherita d'Aragona (1844)\nRosvina de la Forest (1845)\nEmo (1846)\nEleonora Dori (1847) libretto by Salvadore Cammarano\nIl Corsaro della Guadalupe (1853)\nIrene (1847)\nErmelinda (1851) performed in London in English as Esmeralda, or The Hunchback of Notre Dame (c1856)\nErmenilda (1863)\nGiovanna di Castiglia (1863)\nAlba d'Oro (1869)\n\n\n== References ==",

The oratory is dedicated to the 4th-century anti-Arian Saint Hilary of Poitiers, one of the patrons of the city. The oratory is located within the Ospedale Vecchio (old civic hospital) with the entrance sandwiched among the porticoes of facing the strada. This hospital was initially founded in the 13th century by Rodolfo Tanzi.\n\n\n== History ==\nA church, located outside the medieval walls near Porta Croce on the road to Piacenza, dedicated to Sant'Ilario was dedicated in the 13th century after Charles I of Anjou helped the local defeat the Ghibelline forces in town. Razed in 1546 by Pier Luigi Farnese as he expanded the walls. The oratory was moved to a hospital here, dedicated to aiding the poor and infant orphans (Ospedale della Misericordia e delle Esposti). The Baroque interiors were completed by 1663 under the patronage of Francesco Roncalea. The vault of the same was painted by Giovanni Maria Conti della Camera aided by Francesco Reti and Antonio Lombardi Parmigiani between 1664 and 1666. The stucco work was completed by Domenico Reti. To the left of the main altar was incorporated the monument of the founder of the Ospedale della Misericordia, Rodolfo Tanzi.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "St Andrew's Church is the parish church of Blubberhouses, a village in North Yorkshire in England.\nThe church was commissioned by Louisa Frankland Russell, as a chapel of ease to St Michael and St Lawrence's Church, Fewston.  It was designed by Edward Buckton Lamb in the Early English style, and was completed in 1851.  The church was Grade II listed in 1987.\nThe church is built of gritstone and has a stone slate roof.  It consists of a three-bay nave with a north aisle, a three-bay chancel, and a northwest steeple and porch.  The steeple has a tower with two stages, stepped angle buttresses, tall lancet bell openings, deep corbelled eaves and a tall pyramidal spire with lucarnes and a finial.  The porch is up seven steps, and is entered under a pointed arch with a chamfered surround.  Most of the windows have trefoil heads.\nInside, the nave has a stone floor and oak pews, which were relocated from the old church at Thirkleby.  There is a hammerbeam roof, with a king post structure, an experiment by Lamb to ensure that the altar can be seen from every location in the church.  To aid this, the aisle is separated from the nave by a single pillar.  The altar rail and pulpit are made of oak and date from the 17th century.\n\n\n== See also ==\nListed buildings in Blubberhouses\n\n\n== References ==",
