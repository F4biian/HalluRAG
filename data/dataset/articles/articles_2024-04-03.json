        "content": "The Demorest Medal Contests (May 9, 1886 – December 1897) were a system of public oratorical competitions, founded as a means of Prohibition propaganda by William Jennings Demorest in April 1886. It was his idea to make these contests promote directly the growth of Prohibition sentiment by enlisting the effort and winning the sympathy of boys, girls, young men, and young women. After Demorest's death, the Demorest medal system was merged with that of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), and Mrs. Demorest (Ellen Louise Demorest) was placed in charge of the Medal Department. She, however, died a few months later (March 1898), and Adelia E. Carman became head of the Medal Department, which position she held until 1922. Mrs. Carman was succeeded by her daughter, Maude Carman Cathcart.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first contest was held in Bedford Street Methodist Episcopal Church, New York City, on May 9, 1886. In the following year, Mr. and Mrs. Demorest introduced the plan into California. In less than three years, it had spread throughout the various States and into Canada, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Australia, Honolulu, South Africa, China, Burma, and Norway. Up to September 1, 1894, Ms. Demorest had given away 34,000 medals at a cost of US$75,000.\nUnder the plan, competition was first local and among a class of six or more, for a silver medal; then, over a wider territory, between at least six winners of silver medals, for a gold medal; later still, among the winners of gold medals, for a diamond medal, in final competition. Upon every medal the word \"Prohibition\" was plainly inscribed. All recitations by contestants avowedly supported the Prohibition policy and Party. All contestants were required to use recitation books, compiled from the best writings and speeches of the  Prohibition orators and advocates, and issued by the Medal Contest Bureau. Thousands of these books were circulated.\nThe popular methods of these contests, the manner of their preparation, and the local interest aroused in them, insured large attendances wherever they were held, and thus multitudes of men and women, not previously concerned or sympathetic, were led to hear Prohibition discussed from the view-point of Prohibitionists. The motto of the medal itself, \"From Contest to Conquest\", was suggestive of Demorest's own faith and of the purpose held by him and his political associates. The original Demorest medals were furnished free of charge to any one who would drill a class of contestants, on condition that no admission fee was charged and that no collection should be taken from any contest audience.\nAt the time of his death (1895), it was estimated that Demorest had expended on medals (silver, gold, and diamond) and in maintaining the Medal Bureau more than US$100,000.\nBeginning in 1894/6, the prohibition elocution movement in Canada was operated under the management of the national body of the Royal Templars. The Order did not confine the contests to its own societies, but supplied the literature and medals freely to all friendly organizations.\n\n\n== Merger with the WCTU ==\n\nThe WCTU was not slow to recognize the value of this educational system, and soon members of the organization adapted the idea of Medal Contests to its many lines of work. A plan for the organization of a system of distinctly WCTU medal contests was presented to Frances Willard by Adelia Carman, of Chicago, in December, 1895. The general officers of the National WCTU gave their approval, and Carman was directed to inaugurate the work and report the results to the St. Louis Convention the following year, when the system was adopted by a National department of work and Carman named as the superintendent. Recitation books, embracing orations on Prohibition, Total Abstinence, Scientific Temperance, Anti-Narcotics, Franchise, Social Purity, and other topics, were published. Medals were designed with mottoes and emblems of the WCTU, and circulars setting forth the plans of this new system sent out to all the States in the Union.\n\nAt the World's WCTU Convention, held in Toronto, Canada, in October 1897, medal work was adopted as a department and Mrs. Demorest named as World's Superintendent. Soon after that convention, Carman received a letter from Mrs. Demorest, in which she said:— \"I am delighted that you are appointed my associate in medal contests, and as you are at the head of the W. C. T. U. work I feel that it is well to consolidate the two as nearly as possible. The only thought Mr. Demorest had was to educate the rising generation in the principles of total abstinence for the individual and the inherent right of the people to enact the prohibition of the sale of intoxicants for the State and Nation. So long as you adhere to that work you will fulfill his wishes and ours, and we shall not care which medal is used.\"\nIn December 1897, nearly two years after the death of Mr. Demorest, the Demorest Medal Contest system and that of the WCTU were united. Mrs. Demorest held the position as World's Superintendent until her death in March 1898, when she was succeeded by Carman, who had previously served as her assistant.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nEllen A.

This collaboration marks a radical change in the band's sound from their mathy emo roots to a dreamier, more atmospheric sound with lyrical maturation and noticeably refined production quality.\nThe song in particular has received critical acclaim and is considered an album highlight.\nAlongside the song, a music video was also released which follows the narrative of the song and stars former Workaholics star Blake Anderson and pro skater Paul Rodriguez.\n\n\n== References ==",

He joined the 33rd Parachute Commando Regiment in 1972, later becoming director general of Malian customs between 1994 and 1996. Touré then served in the Malian ministry of defense. From 2006 to 2012, he served as Commissioner of Political Affairs, Peace, and Security at ECOWAS. He was appointed brigadier general on October 1, 2010, and then became director of the Alioune Blondin Beye School of Peacekeeping form March 2012.\nTouré became Malian Chief of Staff on November 8, 2013, but resigned after Malian forces were routed during the Second Battle of Kidal in May 2014. Ultimately, he remained in his position, retiring on June 29, 2016. He was replaced by Didier Dacko, and was sacked because of his refusal to sanction the actions of El Hadj Ag Gamou and atrocities committed by GATIA, Gamou's militia.

The main villa incorporated the circular Romanesque shrine of Santa Maria del Monte.\n\n\n== History ==\nA villa at the site was commissioned in 1811 by the Antonio Aldini, minister and plenipotentiary for Napoleon. The architect Giuseppe Nadi designed the villa. Work was interrupted in 1816 with the fall of Napoleon. The broad tympanum facing towards the town center was decorated by the sculptor Giacomo De Maria with pedimental sculptures depicting Olympus. The interiors were frescoed by Felice Giani.\nThe house was auctioned off in 1832, and demolition was contemplated. Bought subsequently by local citizens, in 1842 the architect Antonio Serra converted some of the rooms into a consecrated church. In 2022, the commune of Bologna refurbished the interior of the complex.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Samuel Martin Stephenson (1742 – 13 January 1833) was an Irish presbyterian minister and physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nStephenson was the youngest son of James Stephenson, by his wife Margaret (Martin), was born in 1742 at Straidballymorris, parish of Templepatrick, co. Antrim. From the school of John Rankin, presbyterian minister at Antrim, he went to Glasgow University, where he was a pupil of William Leechman. After being licensed in 1767 by Templepatrick presbytery he became master in the diocesan school at Monaghan, where for two years he lodged with Braddock, an apothecary. This gave him a taste for medicine, which he studied in Dublin and in Edinburgh (1773–6). Meanwhile, he received a call in August 1773 from the congregation of Greyabbey, co. Down. His trial sermon, preached on 19 April 1774, was of doubtful orthodoxy, and he declined to subscribe the Westminster confession of faith. By a majority of one he was admitted on 31 May to ordination, and ordained by Bangor presbytery on 21 June (the date, 20 June, in report to synod, is wrong) 1774, reading a written declaration of his faith. On 12 June 1776 he graduated M.D. at Edinburgh, and practised gratuitously at Greyabbey, where his salary was 50l. besides regium donum. On 1 Aug. 1785 he resigned his charge, and was succeeded by James Porter. Settling as a physician in Belfast, he obtained great distinction in his profession, revolutionising the treatment of fever cases. He founded, in conjunction with James McDonnell, M.D., the dispensary in 1792 and the fever hospital in 1797. He was also a zealous promoter of the (now Royal) Academical Institution which was opened 1 Feb. 1814. In recognition of his high character for public spirit and private charity, the general synod of Ulster in 1818 replaced his name on the ministerial roll, though he had exercised no clerical duties for over thirty years. In 1821 he resigned his public appointments in favour of his son, Robert Stephenson, M.D. (died 1869). Latterly he amused himself with farming. He died on 13 January 1833. He married Mary, daughter of James Armstrong, presbyterian minister of Portaferry, co. Down, and had a numerous family.#\nHe published: \n\n‘The Declaration of Faith,’ Belfast, 1774, 8vo; 2 edits. same year; reprinted, with title ‘Of Articles of Faith,’ [1822?], 8vo.\n‘A Review of the Reasons … and … Remarks upon a late Declaration of Faith,’ Belfast, 1775, 8vo.\n‘De Typho,’ Edinburgh, 1776, 8vo (graduation thesis).\n‘On the Linen and Hempen Manufactures of … Ulster,’ Belfast, 1808, 4to.\n‘An Historical Essay on the Parish … of Templepatrick,’ Belfast, 1825, 8vo.\n‘An Historical Essay on the Parish … of Greyabbey,’ Belfast, 1828, 8vo. The last two works are somewhat miscellaneous in character, but deserve credit as early examples of attention to Irish local antiquities.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Gordon, Alexander (1898). \"Stephenson, Samuel Martin\".

Your goal is to invade all countries of the map, and make sure you do not fall into another country's hands. It involves tactics to progress through the world, especially since you have less troops than them. After your first move in the early levels, the maximum troops you can get is 100, but later you can unlock 120. There are also two upgrades: that amount of troops you gain, and how many units you have at the start. After you finish beating the world, you start over but they have more troops. Your troop number stays the same. The game entirely relies on how many troops you have to invade another. You do not have to conquer everything.\n\n\n== Modes ==\n\n\n=== Player Versus Player ===\n\nThe Player Versus Player mode is when you play with real players around the world in different maps. It involves the same strategy as the original mode, but sometimes more equal troops. You can emote in the game, with a grin, happy, angry, shocked/scared, and sad emotes. Also there are rankings, like Bronze 1, 2, 3, Silver 1, 2, 3, Gold 1, 2, 3, Ruby, etc.",

        "content": "William Clowes the younger (1582–1648) was an English surgeon.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nClowes was the son of William Clowes the elder, surgeon to Queen Elizabeth, studied his art under his father. He was admitted a member of the Barber-Surgeons' Company 22 January 1605. In 1616 he was surgeon to the Prince of Wales (Devon, Issues of Exchequer), and became surgeon to Charles I on his accession. In 1625 he was chosen renter warden of his company, but protested against a king's surgeon being appointed to so low an office, and declined to serve. On 21 August 1626, being then sergeant surgeon to the king, he was elected master of the Barber-Surgeons, and on 16 August 1638 he was a second time elected master. It was the duty of the king's sergeant surgeon to examine all persons brought to be cured by the royal touch (Douglas, The Criterion, ed. 1820, p. 479), and in this capacity Clowes complained of one Leverett, a gardener, who took on himself to cure the king's evil. Leverett was brought before the lords at the Star-chamber 20 October 1637, and Clowes was by them directed to lay the matter before the College of Physicians. Leverett accordingly appeared at the college 3 November 1637, and stated that he cured, by touch alone, king's evil, dropsy, fevers, agues, internal diseases, and external sores, and that, though he did not lay much stress on it, he was a seventh son. A patient with a strumous knee-joint and other cases were given him to experiment on, and on his failure Clowes presented, 28 November 1637, a memorial recounting that Leverett slighted his majesty's sacred gift of healing, enticed great lords and ladies to buy the sheets he had slept in, and deluded the sick with false hopes. He produced certificates from Thomas Clowes and two other surgeons in the city as to Leverett's impostures, and finally, by an extract from the register of St. Clement, Eastcheap, proved that James Leverett was a fourth and not a seventh son, and that his father had but six sons in all. The college thereupon reported to the lords that Leverett was an impostor and deceiver. The last appearance of Clowes in the Barber-Surgeons' Company was on 14 September 1648, and he died a few months later.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1886). \"Clowes, William (1582-1648)\".

        "content": "On June 4, 2005, militants from the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC) attacked a Mauritanian army barracks in Lemgheity, Mauritania. \nThe attack marked the first incursion into Mauritanian territory by the GSPC, and the group's first attack outside of Algerian borders.      \n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC) was a more hardline remnant of the Armed Islamic Group that terrorized Algerian civilians during the later part of the Algerian Civil War, before being pushed to the Sahara Desert. In the Mauritanian barracks at Lemgheity, a small oasis along the Mauritanian-Algerian border, fifty-two men and ten pick-ups were stationed at the barracks prior to the attack. \nThree days before the battle, the GSPC sent out two scouts; a Malian and a Nigerien, to plan the attack. The GSPC referred to the scouting as \"Operation Badr\", in reference to the Battle of Badr. The jihadists had over 150 men according to post-battle estimates from the Mauritanian Army, and were commanded by Mokhtar Belmokhtar, Abderrahman al-Nigiri, and Abdellahi Ould Hmeida. Other prominent jihadists such as Djamel Okacha, Jouleibib, and Khaled al-Barnaoui all participated in the Lemgheity attack as well. \nJust before the attack, an argument broke out within the GSPC. The mufti of the group, a Mauritanian, asked Belmokhtar to send a summons to the Mauritanian soldiers at the barracks urging them to surrender. Algerian militants in the group reacted harshly to the mufti's proposal, demanding all the soldiers be slaughtered. After some hesitation, Belmokhtar rejected the mufti's proposal, but forbade his men to execute any prisoners. \n\n\n== Attack ==\nThe attack began at dawn on June 4, and lasted only fifteen minutes. The jihadists first took control of the barracks' communications post to prevent the soldiers for calling for reinforcements, and then surrounded the weapons depot. The jihadists then launched the attack on the barracks. The Mauritanian forces were caught off guard by the attack; two soldiers tried to flee by foot but were chased and caught by the jihadists. One of the runners, a lieutenant, was shot dead by the jihadists and the other was run over by a pick-up. \nThe jihadists seized six vehicles and heavy weapons. They loaded all of their loot onto vehicles, and fled towards one of their bases in Hassi Touila, Mali. Along the way, the jihadists buried some of the loot and recorded the GPS locations of the stashes. Mauritanian soldiers who were taken prisoner were later released. \n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nMauritanian officials recorded fifteen Mauritanian soldiers killed, seventeen injured, and two missing. The captain of the unit, El Kory Ould Ahmed, was killed during the battle as well. \nMauritanian officials also reported the deaths of nine jihadists. The injured soldiers were evacuated to Nouakchott by three planes. The Mauritanian government accused the GSPC of the attack, which the latter claimed in a statement on June 7. The GSPC claimed to have carried out the attack in retaliation for a series of arrests by Mauritanian officials of senior Islamist leaders and GSPC sympathizers, along with the participation of the Mauritanian Army in exercises with the US Army in the Sahara. Lemine Ould Mohamed Salem, a Mauritanian author, reported the death toll as seventeen Mauritanian soldiers killed, seventeen injured, and thirty-five prisoners, compared to five jihadists killed. \nAbu Musab al-Zarqawi, leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq, congratulated the \"Maghrebi mujahideen\" for their victory on behalf of al-Qaeda. The Lemgheity attack allowed the GSPC to reestablish itself as an international militant group and connect Abdelmalek Droukdel to senior al-Qaeda members, creating a pathway to the formation of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) from the GSPC, which occurred in 2006. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Andrew Douglas (1736 – 10 June 1806) was a Scottish physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nDouglas was born in Teviotdale, Roxburghshire, in 1736, and educated at the university of Edinburgh. He began professional work as a surgeon in the navy in 1756, but returned to Edinburgh in 1775 and graduated M.D. He settled in London with the intention of practising midwifery, and was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians on 30 September 1776. He published ‘De Variolæ Insitione,’ Edinburgh, 1775; ‘Observations on an Extraordinary Case of Ruptured Uterus,’ London, 1785, and in 1789 ‘Observations on the Rupture of the Gravid Uterus.’ He grew rich by marriage, gave up practice, and travelled abroad. From 1792 to 1796 he had the misfortune to be detained a prisoner in France. In 1800 he left London for his native country, and settled in a country house which he had bought near Kelso. He died at Buxton 10 June 1806.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1888). \"Douglas, Andrew (1736-1806)\".

        "content": "Nasir Iqbal (15 June 1982 – 12 January 2018) was a Pakistani footballer who played as a midfielder. He was part of the squad which won the 2004 South Asian Games with Pakistan. He also represented the Pakistan Army departmental team in Pakistan's domestic football.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nIqbal hailed from Samundri in the district of Faisalabad.\n\n\n== Club career ==\nIqbal started playing football at a young age when he was at primary school, and carried his passion into college, from where he was picked up by the Pakistan Army departmental team. In the 2003 National Championship, Iqbal scored a goal in the quarterfinals against Sindh Red in a 1–0 victory, which led to Army until the finals until eventually falling against WAPDA in the penalties. After an injury at his left knee at the Pakistan national team cap, a while after he had won the 2004 South Asian Games on international level, he was dropped from the team.\n\n\n== International career ==\n\n\n=== 2001 England Tour ===\nIn 2001, Iqbal was called by the Pakistan national team during their tour to England, where they played against Bury and Coventry. On a mysterious note, Iqbal went missing from the squad and failed to turn up for the match a day before at Bury's Gigg Lane on 21 March. He disappeared from outside the ground as his teammates gathered for a press conference. The local police and Bury chairman Terry Robinson confirmed they were made aware of the player's disappearance and that representatives of the Pakistani national team were trying to trace him. It was understood that he went to see his relatives in Bolton after sustaining an injury during the training.\n\n\n=== 2004 South Asian Games ===\nIn 2004, Iqbal was called by the Pakistan under-23 national team for the 2004 South Asian Games, where he helped Pakistan win the gold medal. He was praised by his whole village after the achievement.\n\n\n=== Injury ===\nHe also toured Thailand with the national team. Iqbal eventually injured his left knee during a national team camp, which caused him to get dropped from the team.\n\n\n== Post-retirement ==\nDuring more than a decade since Iqbal played a competitive match, he continued to train youngsters at his village and making appearances at local matches as a guest.\n\n\n== Death ==\nIqbal died on the morning of 12 January 2018, after a road accident while transporting sugarcane to Gojra Sugar Mills at his hometown in Samundri near Faisalabad. He left behind a five-year-old daughter and twin boys.\n\n\n=== Aftermath ===\nThe Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) was criticised as it did not show any interest, nor contacted Iqbal's family or put a statement out announcing the death. Iqbal's family equally did not feel the need to appeal anything. The media also showed lack on coverage on Iqbal's demise.\nIqbal's teammate and former national team captain Jaffar Khan expressed deep sorrow and condolence over the demise of Iqbal.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nPakistan Army\n\nNational Championship runner-up: 2003\nPakistan U23\n\nSouth Asian Games: 2004\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2008 Leadership election of Synaspismos took place on 10 February 2008, during its 5th Congress. The two candidates were: Alexis Tsipras and Fotis Kouvelis. Tsipras won with 840 votes, while Kouvelis earned 342 votes, while 14 members voted blank or invalid.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn October 2005, SYN President, Alekos Alavanos, endorsed Alexis Tsipras, known for taking part on the 1990–1991 student protests in Greece, in which he was part of the student group that held talks with the Mitsotakis government, to the party as a candidate for the Athens mayorship.\nSYN members who backed Mihalis Papagiannakis for the mayor race protested against Alavanos' endorsement, who had previously supported Papagiannakis. A majority of the Political Secretariat decided to support Tsipras' candidacy, while the prefectural committee of Athens A' backed Papagiannakis on a knife-edge vote. On Alavanos' advice, the Central Committee rejected the prefectural Committee's decision with a two-thirds majority and Tsipras ended up as the Candidate for the Athens mayorship for SYN on the 2006 Greek local elections. He reached the 3rd place with a percentage of 10,51%, getting 4 seats on the city council.\n\n\n== Candidates ==\n\nFotis Kouvelis' candidancy was backed by members of the \"Renewal Wing\", Thanasis Leventis, Mihalis Papagiannakis, Nikos Tsoukalis και Anna Filini, SYN MEP, Dimitris Papadimoulis and the historical figure of the party, Leonidas Kyrkos\nOn the other camp, Alexis Tsipras' candidancy was backed by members of the \"Left Shift\", Nikos Voutsis, Giannis Dragasakis, Panagiotis Lafazanis, Dimitris Stratoulis and Nikos Hountis, and members of the \"Red-Green Network\" Christoforos Papadopoulos and Euclid Tsakalotos.\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== Subsequent events ==\n\nAfter the Congress, since Tsipras was not a MP, Alekos Alavanos remained as the President of the Parliamentary group of Syriza.\nIn the 2009 European Parliament election in Greece, Synaspismos, being part of Syriza, succeeded in electing Nikolaos Chountis to the European Parliament. The result was considered a failure, due to the stagnation of the percentage, and was criticized by the \"Renewal Wing\" of Synaspismos, with Leonidas Kyrkos calling for the dissolution of Syriza An internal party crisis followed, in which Alavanos announced his intention to resign as president of the parliamentary group of syriza and as an MP, which was not accepted and he recalled, a few days later.\nIn the coming months, and with the coming legislative elections of the same year, Alavanos decided to not take part in them. Syriza, led by Alexis Tsipras, received 4,60% of the vote and elected 13 MPs.\nIn June 2010, the 6th Congress of Synaspismos took place. The \"Renewal Wing\", led by Fotis Kouvelis, disagreeing with Synaspismos taking part in Syriza, left the party, founding the Democratic Left. Kouvelis was followed by 3 more MPs, that left the parliamentary group of SYN.\nIn the May 2012 Greek legislative elections and in the June 2012 Greek legislative elections, Syriza reached the second spot, and elected 52 και 71 MPs according.\nIn July 2013, with Syriza's first congress in sight, an emergency Synaspismos congress took place, in which a large majority decided to abolish and combine itself within Syriza\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Parliamentary elections were held in Serbia on 1 June [O.S. 19 May] 1903. However, the elected members never convened due to the May Coup that occurred on 10–11 June [O.S. 28–29 May] 1903.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe elections were called after a self-coup by King Alexander I on 25 March. Alexander first issued a royal proclamation suspending the 1901 constitution and disbanding the parliament elected in 1901. He then appointed new members to the Senate. Through a second proclamation 45 minutes later, he reinstated the constitution and called for fresh elections in May.\nThe government prepared an agreed list of candidates, which included members of all existing parties, although only who were considered \"moderate\". The Radical Party boycotted the elections amidst a police crackdown on the opposition, though some independent Liberals, Radicals and Progressives presented their own lists in some constituencies.\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nDue to the May Coup, during which both King Alexander I and Prime Minister Dimitrije Cincar-Marković were assassinated, a government was formed under Jovan Avakumović. The government reconvened the previous parliament with the intention of amending the constitution and to elect a new king. Fresh elections were held in September 1903 under a new constitution.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "A rickshaw van (Bengali: রিকশা ভ্যান) or van-gari (Bengali: ভ্যান গাড়ি) is a three-wheeled bicycle with a large wooden platform on the back part, used primarily to transport people and goods. It is a common mode of transportation in Bangladesh and India, popular because of its cheap price. Furthermore, it does not require fossil fuels or cause air pollution. \nThe wooden platform is approximately four foot square. Sometimes, steel is used in the platform for durability. It can carry up to approximately 330 kg loads or seven people. Sometimes, it is used as an ambulance. It can be also used as a mobile cart to sell goods particularly among those of lower income groups. \nOne or more chains are used to connect the pedal with the back two wheels. The work can be very strenuous. However, some of the vehicles are battery-operated. This enables physically challenged individuals to be van-gari drivers.\n\n\n== References ==",

He became a physician in London, and besides attaining some eminence in his profession was an active liberal politician, and an intimate friend of Sir William Molesworth, Admiral Sir Charles Napier, and other representatives of Southwark. He was one of the first medical officers of health for Bermondsey, in which capacity he published various reports in 1856 and subsequent years. He also wrote 'Should the Cholera come, what ought to be done?' (1848); a cheap tract 'How to avoid the Cholera,' of which many thousands were sold; 'Medical Advice to Mothers' (1851); 'Letter to Lord Palmerston on Sanitary Reform' (1854); and 'How do People hasten Death?' (1851). He was M.D. and F.R.C.P. Edin. He died suddenly on 11 May 1863.\nHis wife was the author Annie Emma Challice.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Stephen, Leslie, ed.

        "content": "The New Belarus passport project was initiated by the United Transitional Cabinet of Belarus (a government-in-exile) to provide legal identification for the citizens of Belarus emigrated for political reasons, in response to the decree of President Alexander Lukashenko forbidding the issuance and renewal of Belarusian passports abroad. For the oppositionists to return to Belarus for passport renewal means an imminent prosecution.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe exiled Belarusian opposition started discussing this idea in 2020. The Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya thought of it as a rather symbolic gesture. However, with the outbreak of the Russia–Ukraine war, in which Belarus was indirectly, but considerably involved, the treatment of the idea became more serious. Tikhanouskaya first put forth this idea  before the European Union and European countries in March 2023 and seeks support from them in this endeavor.\n\n\n== Issues ==\nWhile there are a variety travel documents issued by some states, such as laissez-passer, they cannot resolve a number of legal services. Therefore, the full-fledged passport is a rather pressing issue for the Belarusian opposition in exile.\nThe two fundamental issues to be resolved are the legal recognition and international security standards for the document, of which the legal recognition is the most complex issue. A related issue is that passports have to have a unique three-letter country code. There is a preliminary agreement with an undisclosed country that it would share its code.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNansen passport\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttps://www.belarus-passport.com/",

        "content": "Under keel clearance (UKC) is the term and calculations used in seafaring to ensure sufficient navigable water is available for ships at sea. It is most commonly described as the height and width of available water below the keel (hull of a ship). More simply, it can be described as how much water is left between the bottom of the ship and the seabed.\nMaster mariners should ensure there is sufficient minimum UKC for their ships and ports should ensure sufficient minimum UKC for the type and draft of ships due to arrive in the port. Ships typically calculate their UKC to meet criteria for ports to minimise the risk of maritime incidents. A minimum UKC value is determined, which includes a safety margin.\n\n\n== Methods of calculation ==\nAt a basic level, it is typically calculated in metres using the formula: Charted Depth − Draft -/+ Height of Tide = UKC. Ship masters and deck officers can obtain the depth of water from Electronic navigational charts. More dynamic or advanced calculations include safety margins for manoeuvring effects and squat.\nComputer systems and software can be used to manage and calculate UKC for ships and ports. These include systems that dynamically manage UKC using models, forecasting and calculations.\nThe International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) sets a Standard for UKC Management for software and systems: S-129 Under Keel Clearance Management. \n\n\n== Uses and requirements ==\nFor US waters, the US Code of Federal Regulations require ships and their masters to calculate UKC based on the ship's deepest navigational draft.33 CFR 157.450 The regulations require the master to discuss the UKC calculation with the maritime pilot as the ship approaches US ports/waters.33 CFR 157.450 \nThe Australian Maritime Safety Authority state that maintaining adequate UKC is important for safe navigation in the Torres Strait.\nInadequate UKC, caused by shallow water and squat may lead to ship groundings. In 2019, the UK Marine Accident Investigation Branch found that indequate UKC contributed towards the grounding of the ro/ro freight ferry MS Stena Performer.\nChanges in water level may cause issues with adequate UKC for ships. For example, recent water level reductions in the Panama Canal have reduced UKC for ships meaning some ships are not able to transit the canal.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Burn of Columbia Valley is an American Viticultural Area (AVA) located within Klickitat County in south-central Washington on the north banks of the Columbia River along the Oregon state border.  The Burn of Columbia Valley was established by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau {TTB), Treasury  on July 17, 2021, after reviewing a petition received from Kevin Corliss, Vice President of Vineyards for Ste. Michelle Wine Estates, Joan R. Davenport, Professor of Soil Sciences at Washington State University, and John Derrick, Vice President of Operations for Mercer Ranches, Inc., proposing “The Burn of Columbia Valley” viticultural area.  The appellation, known colloquially as “The Burn,” encompasses about 16,870 acres (26 sq mi) where 3 commercial vineyards cultivate approximately 1,261 acres (510 ha) as many Washington wineries source grapes from here. The state's 18th AVA lies entirely within the vast Columbia Valley appellation and stands alone between the Columbia Gorge and the Horse Heaven Hills viticultural areas. The distinguishing features of The Burn of Columbia Valley are its soils, climate, and topography.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThere is no exact consensus on where the name \"The Burn\" originated, although it has been used in reference to the area for generations. \"The Burn\" may refer to a local legend where early settlers set clearing fires to the benchland every Fall and rejuvenate the native springtime grasses for their horses.\n“The name \"The Burn\" not only has a bit of legend behind it, but also historical name evidence,” said petitioner Kevin Corliss. “For example, in the early 1900s, mail was delivered from the SP&S Railway station in Sundale, WA, to this area with the designation \"The Burn.\" Additionally, the USGS online map continues to call this area \"The Burn.\" It may also be based on the Gaelic, German, and English-inspired use of the term \"burn\", as in \"Bannockburn\" or \"born,\" as in \"Padderborn\" or \"bourne,\" as in \"Melbourne\" to refer to a stream or a river, respectively.\n\n\n== Terroir ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nThe topography of The Burn of Columbia Valley AVA consists of gently sloping bench lands above the Columbia River. Elevations in the appellation range from 270 to 1,780 feet (82–543 m) above sea level. The average slope angle within the AVA is 7.27 percent, which is suitable for mechanical cultivation of vineyards, yet is steep enough to avoid the pooling of cold air that could damage grapes. The AVA also has a large, contiguous expanse of land with easterly and southern aspects, as well as a southeasterly aspect, which allows excellent sunlight exposure for vineyards.\n\n\n=== Soil ===\nThe soils of The Burn are primarily silty loams in the taxonomic order Mollisols. Soils are described as having good plant-available water holding capacity that are capable of delivering sufficient water to the vines during the growing season. The soils are also relatively high in organic material and provide adequate nutrients, particularly nitrogen, to the vines. The most common soil series and complexes in the AVA are Walla Walla silt loam (without cemented substratum), Rock outcrop–Haploxeroll complex, Haploxeroll–Fluvaquent complex, Fluventic Haploxeroll–Riverwash complex, Rock outcrop Rubble and Complex, Wato silt loam, Walla Walla silt loam (with cemented substratum), Endicott silt loam, and Endicott–Moxee complex.  In the region to the south of The Burn,  the soils contain series and complexes also not present within the AVA, including Ritzville silt loam, Willis silt loam, and Roloff–Rock outcrop complex.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate within The Burn AVA is characterized by an average annual growing degree day 1 (GDD) accumulation of 2,763 GDDs, with a minimum of 2,405 GDDs and a maximum of 3,249 GDDs. Average annual GDD accumulations to the east-northeast and northwest of the AVA are lower, and average annual rainfall amounts are higher than within the area.  The average annual GDD accumulations favor the production of grape varietals with higher heat unit requirements, such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, which are the two most commonly grown grape varietals in the AVA. The Burn receives an average of 8.76 inches of precipitation annually, with a minimum of 6.65 inches and a maximum of 10.44 inches. Low annual rainfall amounts mean that vineyards will require supplemental irrigation.\n\n\n=== Wind ===\nIn neighboring Horse Heaven Hills viticultural area, its petition specified as a significant distinguishing feature the persistent strong winds the area receives. Based on the proximity to the Columbia River, with the Columbia Gorge acting as a funnel, both Horse Heaven Hills and The Burn AVAs receive significantly more wind than surrounding areas. In the article titled \"The Columbia Gorge Wind Funnel\" from the August 1953 issue (pp. 104–107) of Weatherwise magazine, Howard E. Graham of the National Weather Service’s Portland, Oregon, office, explains the Columbia Gorge wind patterns are a function of the pressure differences between the west and east ends of the 120 miles (193 km) long river canyon. The Gorge surrounds the Columbia River between Bridal Veil, Oregon, in the west, and Arlington, Washington, in the east. The article emphasizes that the persistent winds, rarely calm, always flow along the axis of the Gorge. The Pacific winds from the west bring moderating, mild maritime air into the Gorge. Conversely, the continental high winds from the east bring in dry air that is seasonably hot or cold. The heat of the Columbia Basin draws these intense winds north over The Burn and Horse Heaven Hills after they exit the Columbia Gorge. Wind through the Columbia Gorge is determined by Wind Run Miles (WRMs), a unit of measure for the force and speed of wind in one hour. The Horse Heaven Hills viticultural area records an average of 30 percent more WRMs than the Walla Walla Valley AVA to the east and the Yakima Valley AVA to the north, and 20 percent more than the Red Mountain AVA to the immediate north. These three surrounding viticultural areas, unlike the Horse Heaven Hills region, are not in the direct wind funnel path of the Columbia Gorge.\n\nThe wind's effect on viticulture is especially noted during the grapevine bud-break to fruit-set period, according to a 1982 article, \"Influence of Windbreaks and Climatic Region on Diurnal Fluctuation of Leaf Water Potential, Stomatal Conductance, and Leaf Temperature of Grapevines\" by Freeman, Kliewer, and Stern in the American Journal of Enological Viticulture (vol. 33, pp.233–236). The most-often observed consequences of the higher winds within the affected AVAs include a reduction in canopy size and density of grapes on the vines. Also, vines are less prone to disease, based on the wind's drying of wet plant surfaces on where fungal spores or bacteria can land. The volume of wind is also a key factor in determining the amount of irrigation needed for optimum vine growth.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTTB AVA Map",

In 168 BC, after the victorious Battle of Pydna, Lentulus was sent with other ambassadors to capture Perseus, King of Macedonia. In 162 BC, he was made suffect consul together with Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, because the ordinary consuls, Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Corculum and Gaius Marcius Figulus, had abdicated from the consulship due to issues with the auspices. In 156 BC, Lentulus was sent as the head of an embassy to the Roman territories in the eastern Mediterranean. In 125 BC, he served as princeps senatus. In 122 BC, the already elderly man took part in the violence against Gaius Gracchus and was wounded.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "MAIF, in its full form Mutuelle assurance des instituteurs de France, is a French mutual insurance company founded in 1934 and headquartered in Niort, in the Deux-Sèvres region of France. It is governed by the French Insurance Code. It has traditionally offered its services to teachers, since 2000 to employees in the social economy and local authorities, and since 2021 to all employees and companies.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe mutual was founded on May 17, 1934, under the acronym MAAIF for mutual automobile insurance company for teachers in France, in Fontenay-le-Comte, Vendée, by 156 teachers representing 301 members, including 13 female teachers, meeting at the Café des Marronniers. At the beginning of June, Edmond Proust was appointed president of the Young Mutual Society. In 1935, the mutual moved to Niort.\nIn 1938, bodily injury was covered. In 1942, 10,000 members (out of 35,000) continued to pay their car insurance premiums, despite the total loss, thus saving the mutual. In the same year, bicycle insurance was created to compensate for the consequences of the war, during which cars were immobilized or requisitioned. At the same time, Edmond Proust joined the Resistance, first as a prisoner of war and then after his release. After his release in August 1941, he regained his position as president.\nIn 1947, a purchasing group was created: the Coopérative des adhérents de la MAAIF (Camif), offering a list of products at advantageous prices. In 1950, MAAIF took off, and membership grew rapidly.\nMAAIF helped craftsmen and tradesmen by providing financial support for the creation of Macif (1960) and Matmut (1961), and by sharing its experience and staff with MAAF (1950). Together with GMF, these four mutual insurers created a joint trade association in 1964: Groupement des sociétés d'assurance à caractère mutuel, which became Groupement des entreprises mutuelles d'assurance (GEMA) in 1989.\nIn 1952, auto cover was grouped into a single contract (previously there were four: Motor Third Party Liability, Vehicle Theft and Fire, Defense and Recourse, Bodily Injury Compensation). Three years later, a multi-coverage home policy called RAQVAM (Risques Autres Que Véhicules à Moteur) was offered. Previously, several contracts covered home, third-party liability...\nIn 1965, MAAIF began to organize its activities around associations and local authorities. The following year, MAAIF created a tourist assistance service, MAAIF Assistance. It is included in car and household insurance policies at no extra cost. Outside France, MAAIF Assistance relies on the network of member-policyholders teaching abroad. In 1981, it was professionalized and brought together under the name of Inter Mutuelles Assistance, in partnership with the other two Niort-based mutuals (MAAF and Macif).\nIn 1969, MAAIF became MAIF. The disappearance of the \"A\" (the word \"automobile\") confirmed the widening of the mutual's field of activity. From then on, the two policies Vam (\"Véhicule à moteur\") and Raqvam (\"Risque autres que véhicules à moteur\") accompanied the rise of the consumer society. The mutual opened up to new members, in particular youth and cultural centers and other popular education organizations. In 1980, the MAIF Prevention Association was created to educate schools about road and home risks.\nIn 1984, MAIF created Pacs (\"Protection du conducteur assuré et des siens\"), a contract to protect both driver and passenger. The following year, the life insurance company Parnasse-VIE (now MAIF Vie) was created.\nBy 1995, MAIF had 1.5 million members and sales of 6.7 billion francs.\nIn 2000, MAIF began advertising on television under the slogan \"MAIF Assureur militant\", which was unveiled at the June general meeting in Paris. In 2009, MAIF took part in the creation of SGAM Sferen with Macif and Matmut, in order to pool their resources. Finally, other social economy structures (mutuals, cooperatives) and local authorities can also become members of the Mutuelle from this date. In 2011, the MAIF Associations & Collectivités brand was created. It brings together the network and the offer aimed at this public11.\nIn 2014, after announcing its intention to leave SFEREN in April, Maif's Extraordinary General Meeting officially voted on the withdrawal process on May 29, 2014; this vote is subject to the approval of the Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution, which has three months to give its opinion.\n\nIn September 2015, MAIF acquired a stake in NUMA, becoming one of its main shareholders.In 2017, the insurer's sales totaled 3.5 billion euros. In 2020, it will have 2.8 million automobile policyholders.\nOn July 11, 2020, an Extraordinary General Meeting validated the Board of Directors' proposal to turn MAIF into a company with a mission, as permitted by the 2019 Loi Pacte. On this occasion, the mutual removes socio-professional criteria from its conditions of access: it opens up to employees in all sectors, as well as to small and medium-sized business-to-business companies and merges, on January 1, 2021, with its subsidiary Filia-MAIF and its 900,000 member-policyholders.\nIn 2020, hit by the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, MAIF quadrupled its net profit compared with 2019 (36 million euros versus 127 million euros).\nApproaching the statutory age limit, Dominique Mahé steps down as chairman in 2022 with the election of his successor Yves Pellicier.\n\n\n== Principle ==\nThe founders' main principles are:\n\nindependence from major financial companies\ngroups, direct distribution of contracts without commissioned intermediaries,\nsolidarity between members,\nmember responsibility,\nand values such as republicanism and secularism, as expressed in the mutual's charter and actions.\nThe company operates on the principle of collective profit, where individual profits are eliminated, and profits are redistributed through member dividends. The organization does not compensate any shareholders. Instead, it belongs to all member-policyholders. Any surpluses generated are distributed among member-policyholders in the form of rebates or allocated to strengthen the mutual's financial base, as decided by the General Meeting. MAIF was initially reserved for schoolteachers only, but later opened its doors to other members of the French education system, as well as those in research, culture, associations, and local authorities.\n\n\n== Organization and governance ==\nAs a mutual, MAIF has neither share capital nor shareholders. Its customers, known as member-policyholders, acquire a say in the company's policies and strategies by joining the mutual. Every 3 years, they take part in the election of member-policyholder delegates at the General Meeting, on the principle of \"1 member = 1 vote\". This system of member representation brings together some 760 elected representatives, divided into 3 divisions and 30 territorial groupings. They represent member-policyholders at General Meetings, vote on MAIF's activities and financial statements, elect the directors, and attend regional group meetings twice a year.\nThe \"mandataires du Conseil d'Administration\" (MCA), who are appointed by the Board of Directors, form a permanent link between the mutual, its members and its socio-economic environment. They are also responsible for coordinating mutualist life and the preventive actions implemented by MAIF.\nMutualist representatives are those who combine the titles of elected delegates of member-policyholders and representatives on the board of directors. There are around 600 of them, making up the militant team.

After graduating M.D. at Rheims he became a licentiate of the London College of Physicians in 1744. He practised for many years at St. Kitts in the West Indies, and afterwards settled at Bath. Later he retired to the continent, dying at Brussels in 1786. Canvane was a fellow of the Royal Society, and shares with Fraser, an army surgeon, the credit of introducing castor oil into this country, having had large experience of its beneficial employment in medicine in the West Indies. He published a pamphlet on the subject in 1766.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Bettany, George Thomas (1887). \"Canvane, Peter\".

In comparison to the original announcement by Huchon, the project underwent some changes. The plans for the Garges-lès-Gonesse - Villepinte and Saclay - Massy routes were abandoned in exchange for a new route running from the 13th arrondissement of Paris at Bibliothèque nationale de France to Les Ardoines and Choisy-le-Roi. Other branches and sections were also studied to enhance the T Zen network, including branches recommended in an Île-de-France report known as the Plan de Mobilisation.\nT Zen 1 : Lieusant - Moissy (Sénart) – Corbeil-Essonnes\nT Zen 2 : Carré Sénart – Melun\nT Zen 3 : Porte de Pantin ou Jules Ladoumègue – Livry-Gargan (via RN 3)\nT Zen 4 : Corbeil-Essonnes – Évry-Courcouronnes – Grigny\nT Zen 5 : Bibliothèque François-Mitterrand – Les Ardoines (Vitry-sur-Seine)\n4 July 2011: Line 1 opens\n6 July 2011: Confirmation that Line 5 will run to Choisy-le-Roi.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nT Zen is a bus rapid transit network running on segregated rights-of-way, inspired by the Nantes Busway and the Cristalis bus routes in Lyon. It is similar to the RATP's Trans-Val-de-Marne. The line operators were chosen directly by Île-de-France Mobilités and sent offers.\n\n\n== References ==",

According to the band members, the song was written a few years ago and was to be included in a new album, which was to be released in April 2022.\n\n\n== Video ==\nAccording to the idea of director Oleg Tomin, the video clip \"Flowers of Mine Zones\" depicts as it were two different dimensions - a relatively calm life in the rear and active combat operations on the fronts of the war for the Freedom and Independence of Ukraine. However, the most important thing is the intersection of these worlds, from which the common reality of all Ukrainians is formed. When there is an awareness of actual needs and requirements. When war is at arm's length, the rear is at arm's length.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024 Ukrainian Cup Final is the 31st final match of the annual Ukrainian football cup competition. It scheduled to be played on 15 May 2024 at the Avanhard Stadium in Rivne. This is the first time the cup final would be held in Rivne.\nWith still ongoing full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation, the final is expected to be the first one since the start of the invasion in February of 2022 and the 9th since the start of the war in 2014.\n\n\n== Road to the final ==\n\nNote: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away).\n\n\n=== Vorskla Poltava ===\nAs a Premier League team, Vorskla Poltava started in the Round of 16, notionally away at Ukrainian Premier League side Metalist 1925 Kharkiv. At the Livyi Bereh Arena near Kyiv, Vorskla Poltava won 3–0 with a series of goals from Ibrahim Kane, Ruslan Stepanyuk, and Ivan Nesterenko. In the quarter-finals, they were drawn away at Ukrainian Premier League team Obolon Kyiv and won 3–0 at the Obolon Arena in Kyiv due to goals from Stepanyuk, Kane, and Andriy Batsula. In the semi-finals at away Zhytomyr Tsentralnyi Stadion, they played fellow Ukrainian Premier League Polissia Zhytomyr and reached their third final with a 1–0 win with a Serhiy Myakushko goal.\n\n\n=== Shakhtar Donetsk ===\nAs a Premier League team, Shakhtar Donetsk started in the Round of 16, they were drawn away to Veres Rivne and won 3-0 at the Avanhard Stadium in Rivne thanks to goals from Kashchuk, Bondarenko and Ocheretko. In the Quarter-finals, they were drawn against Viktoriya Sumy and won 3-0 at the Livyi Bereh in Hnidyn with goals from Nazaryna, Zubkov and Rakitskyi. In the Semi-Finals, they were drawn to Chornomorets Odesa and won 4-1 at Arena Lviv thanks to goals from Sikan, Bondarenko (penalty) and a brace from Sudakov.\n\n\n== Previous encounters ==\nBoth clubs exist since the Soviet times, but they never played each other in official games (domestic league, national cup) with Shakhtar playing at the top tier and Vorskla (earlier as Kolos) at the third tier of the All-Union football competitions.\nFollowing dissolution of the Soviet Union, a matchup of these teams became more regular. While Vorskla is recognized as an obvious underdog, it is considered as not an easy opponent for the miners. Within the Ukrainian Cup, both teams met 9 times with 6 matches played at quarterfinals stage. Vorskla was victorious twice, while Shakhtar has 5 wins. However, this is their second final and in the last one between them, in 2009, Vorskla gained its only national trophy thus far.\nThis is also the second final for the Vorskla's manager Serhiy Dolhanskyi who in 2009 as a captain and goalkeeper of Vorskla won the cup already in the role of a player in the Vorskla–Shakhtar final.\n\n\n=== Teams at the competition's finals ===\n\n\n== Match ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n2023–24 Ukrainian Premier League\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nUkrainian Cup.

The channel is owned by Al-Murad Group, who also owns the Ajman Independent Studios and Channel 4 FM.\n\n\n== History ==\nAjman TV began broadcasting on 1 February 1996, long after the founding of the Ajman Independent Studios, which as of the time of the TV station's launch had produced over 7,000 hours of content. The station was inaugurated by Sheikh Humaid bin Rashid Al Nuaimi III of Ajman and broadcast a terrestrial signal on UHF channel 26. The station was known as \"Channel 4\" because it was the fourth television station in the United Arab Emirates, after Sharjah TV, Emirates Dubai Television (the current Dubai TV which also included Dubai 33, the current Dubai One) and Abu Dhabi Television. On 1 February 1998, two years after the terrestrial launch, Ajman TV expanded its reach by starting its satellite broadcasts on the Arabsat satellite. By 2002, Ajman TV had cemented its position thanks to its broadcast of quiz and game shows, as well as drama and family entertainment. In its early years, Ajman TV had the only English-language special program during Ramadan – a quiz show.\nIn August 2003, it started broadcasting Channel 7 to 9, carrying Hindi programming. Drama series were supplied by Star Plus.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Lucas Rey (born 27 April 1997) is a France rugby union player who plays as a hooker for Section Paloise in the Top 14 competition. He made his Top 14 debut with his club on 21 May 2016.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nLucas Rey was born on April 27, 1997, in Pau. The son of Joël Rey, a legend of Section Paloise, he initially leaned towards football before taking up rugby union in 2004. He then joined the academy at Section Paloise with his friend Antoine Hastoy.\nHe earned international selections with the France national under-18 rugby union team, with whom he won the Rugby Europe Under-18 Championship in 2015, alongside players like Arthur Retière, Alexandre Roumat, Florian Verhaeghe, or Peato Mauvaka.\n\n\n=== Section Paloise ===\nLucas Rey began his professional career with his home club Section Paloise on May 21, 2016, during the 24th round of the 2015–16 Top 14 season against ASM Clermont Auvergne under the guidance of Simon Mannix. At the end of that season, he signed a two-season espoir contract with Section Paloise.\nIn the 2016–17 Top 14 season, he played 3 Top 14 matches and 5 matches in the European Challenge.\nIn December 2017, he signed his first professional contract and continued his development alongside his friend Antoine Hastoy. During the 2017–18 Top 14 season, he participated in 13 Top 14 matches with 2 starts and 8 matches in the European Challenge.\nThe following season, in 2018–2019, he established himself as a starter and played 20 Top 14 matches and 4 matches in the European Challenge, scoring 2 tries in the championship. In 2019–2020, he played in 17 Top 14 matches, with 7 starts, and 4 matches in the European Challenge. He scored 1 try in the championship and 1 in the European Cup. In January 2021, he extended his contract for two additional seasons. On May 9 of the same year, he played his hundredth match for Section Paloise in a 47–7 victory against SU Agen. During the 2020–21 Top 14 season, he played 26 matches, with 15 starts and 4 tries in Top 14, as well as one match in the European Challenge, serving as captain on several occasions.\nStarting from the 2021–22 Top 14 season, Rey became the full-time captain of the team. A fixture in the locker room, he participated in 24 Top 14 matches, including 16 as a starter, and scored 1 try. He also played one match in the European Challenge.\nIn January 2023, he extended his contract until June 2027. On May 28, during the final day of the season against Montpellier HR, he played his hundred and fiftieth match for Section Paloise. During the 2022–23 Top 14 season, he played 20 Top 14 matches, including 16 as a starter, and scored 1 try. He also played two matches in the EPCR Challenge Cup.\nAt the beginning of the 2023–2024 season, Rey admitted to being impacted by losing the captain's armband to Beka Gorgadze and then Luke Whitelock, in addition to the departure of his close friends Antoine Hastoy and Quentin Lespiaucq, forcing him to gain more perspective and maturity.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Lucas Rey (rugby union) at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Rosehaugh House was an estate located near the village of Avoch in the Highland council area of Scotland. It consisted of a manor house, gardens, parkland, agricultural land, and several outlying buildings. The property has been documented since the 14th century and was one of the estates of the regionally dominant Mackenzies. In the 17th century, the lawyer and later Lord Advocate George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh resided there, known for his role in witch trials. He built the earliest documented manor house there. The Mackenzie family inherited Rosehaugh as their seat. James Fletcher, a merchant, acquired Rosehaugh in the 1860s after the insolvency of James Mackenzie, 6th Baronet. Fletcher modernised and expanded agricultural and livestock activities at Rosehaugh. In 1953, following the death of his son's widow, an insurance company purchased the estate for commercial purposes.\nAfter the Fletchers' extensive additions and remodelling, Rosehaugh House was considered the epitome of opulent late Victorian architecture. In the 1950s, the cost of maintaining the manor house was deemed economically unviable by the owner, leading to its demolition in 1959. Only several exterior buildings remain, which are currently being restored and rented out as living spaces or holiday homes. Fifteen of the surviving outbuildings are classified as category \"B\" or \"C\" monuments in the Scottish heritage lists. The former dairy is of particular note, as it is protected as a category \"A\" listed building. The estate, along with its former park and gardens, is considered particularly significant by Historic Environment Scotland, which has awarded it the highest rating of \"outstanding\" in two of six categories.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe estate dates back to the 14th century and has had several names over time, including Petconachy (1456), Petquhonochty (1458), Pettenochy (1527), Pittanicty (1745–1750; Roy's Map of Scotland), and finally Pittanochtie. Its name may have originated from the Gaelic Pit Dhonnachaidh, meaning \"Duncan's place\" or \"Duncan's court\". Rosehaugh, on the other hand, indicated the land adjacent to Pittanochtie. The name Rosehaugh is derived from the words \"rose\" and \"haugh\". \"Rose\" may refer to the vine rose or Gaelic \"ros(s)\" meaning \"(rock) ledge\". \"Haugh\" is an obsolete term for river meadow. Therefore, Rosehaugh means either \"rose meadow\" or \"meadow at the (rock) ledge\". The stream Rosehaugh Burn originates on the estate and flows into Avoch Bay on the Moray Firth as Avoch Burn.\n\n\n=== Mackenzie era ===\nThe estates of Pittanochtie and Rosehaugh in the historical county of Ross-shire belonged to the Mackenzies, the dominant clan in the Easter Ross region. A house with an L-shaped floor plan and modest dimensions is documented there from 1662. In the late 1660s, George Mackenzie, a native of Dundee, acquired the property. He was the son of Simon Mackenzie of Lochslin Castle and cousin of Kenneth Mackenzie, 3rd Earl of Seaforth. The Earls of Seaforth were one of the four most influential noble lines in the Highlands at that time, alongside the Dukes of Argyll, Atholl, and Gordon. George Mackenzie was a prominent Scottish lawyer who served as Lord Advocate in 1677 and was a member of the Privy Council of Scotland, which advised the Scottish king. Mackenzie is known for his involvement in witch trials and the persecution of the Covenanters, a reformed movement that opposed the re-Catholicisation of Scotland under Charles II. This earned him the nickname \"Bloody Mackenzie\". His book, Laws and Customs of Scotland in Matters Criminal, is considered the first book on Scottish criminal law. Upon being knighted in 1674, George Mackenzie chose the name Sir George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh. In 1688, just three years before his death, George Mackenzie sold the Pittanochtie estate to Kenneth Mackenzie, a politician who was later made a baronet in 1702/3. Despite this sale, Rosehaugh continued to employ George Mackenzie for his heirs.\nRosehaugh was inherited by the Mackenzie baronets. The estate was eventually sold to George Ross of Pitkerrie. The first steps in the development of the estate's landscape appear to date from around this time. Roderick Mackenzie, the 4th Baronet, reunited Rosehaugh and Pittanochtie. He had the first documented manor house built there in 1798, which he called Rosehaugh House. The newer house was constructed above the older one, providing an additional panoramic view of the grounds. According to an estimate, it cost between £3000 and £4000 to build. In 1811, Roderick Mackenzie's second son, James Wemyss Mackenzie, 5th Baronet, inherited the estate. Through his marriage to Henrietta of Suddie, who was set to inherit the neighbouring Suddie estate to the west, Rosehaugh was expanded. James Mackenzie developed the estate by constructing a farmhouse and other agricultural buildings in the 1810s. In 1820, construction of the state road section between Munlochy and Avoch (now the A832) progressed. The road cut through the estate, prompting a complete redesign of the main driveway, which was then oriented southwest towards the new road.\nFar-reaching developments began under James John Randoll Mackenzie, 6th Baronet, who inherited Rosehaugh on the death of his father in 1843. He significantly extended the manor house and the estate and commissioned Edinburgh-based landscape architect C.H.J. Smith to develop the gardens. Various outbuildings and quarters for the estate servants were also constructed, and Smith designed terraced gardens that extend down the slope to the south of the manor house. The 2.4 hectare gardens to the southeast of Rosehaugh House were created between 1844 and 1850, although Smith's design was not realised. During this phase, other areas of the estate were also formalised, and paths were laid out. By 1850, the estate had seven gates for access. In the 1850s, Mackenzie was able to service his ongoing loans through the sale of land. However, he became insolvent in 1862 and left Scotland for France, where he died in 1884. During the era of the Mackenzie lairds, Donald Cameron, a bagpiper, composed the Rosehaugh House march.\n\n\n=== Fletcher era ===\nFollowing Mackenzie's bankruptcy, James Fletcher purchased the 25.9 square kilometres of Rosehaugh for £145,000. Despite being born and raised in Elgin, Moray, Fletcher's family hailed from Avoch. Fletcher amassed his wealth as a merchant in Liverpool, where he established the import firm Jack Bros. with his brother. The company was among the largest British organisations in maritime trade with Peru. Fletcher personally managed the branch in Arequipa, Peru, until 1845. The trade goods that were most important to the region included wool from llamas, alpacas, and vicuñas, which was necessary for the textile industry. Fletcher rapidly expanded Rosehaugh's area to 42.9 km2 through acquisitions. In addition to his duties as a company director, Fletcher managed two agricultural estates in Forfarshire and invested in mines and railway companies. However, he devoted a significant amount of energy to further developing Rosehaugh. The focus of Fletcher's efforts was on restructuring the estate's agriculture and reclaiming previously unused land. To achieve this, he had 1335 hectares of fallow land ploughed and further areas developed by draining moors. Further on, he drained Loch Scadden near Avoch, covering 24 hectares, by creating a system of 4.5 metre-deep canals. To structure the activities in the growing areas, the farms were bundled into organizational units, each farming 400 to 600 hectares. The central estate managed an area of around 2000 hectares. Alexander Ross, a prominent Highland architect, was entrusted by Fletcher with the structural development of Rosehaugh, which included the extension and remodelling of Rosehaugh House, as well as the construction and revision of numerous external buildings. The terraces on the south side and the adjoining greenhouses to the east were constructed during this period. The precise extent of Ross's contribution is uncertain.\n\nIn 1885, James Fletcher passed away, leaving his possessions and a large sum of money to James Douglas Fletcher. The latter was involved in the tea and rubber trade in Ceylon, where he managed plantations covering 11.8 km2 and 4.1 km2 respectively. Fletcher's Rosehaugh Tea & Rubber Company was acquired in 1978 and operated as a property developer, Rosehaugh, in London before being wound up in 1992. It was during his tenure that the estate underwent its most significant developments. By 1903, Fletcher had spent approximately £250,000 on Rosehaugh House, making it the most expensive private building project in the UK at the time. The architect William Flockhart from Glasgow, who operated his office in London, was commissioned for the planning. The project involved constructing an artificial lake with an island, damming the Killen Burn (which required relocating several families), and redirecting the water to flow over a cascading waterfall (known as Horseshoe Falls) to generate electricity. Additionally, extensive greenhouses were installed, and terraced gardens were created to the south of the manor house. By 1893, the interior of Rosehaugh House had been modernised. After Flockhart completed his work, Fletcher commissioned the architect to carry out another substantial extension to the manor house. This extension was carried out between 1898 and 1903. Stylistically, Rosehaugh House, which was largely designed by Ross, did not correspond in any way to Flockhart's work. During the extension, it was decided to carry out a comprehensive overhaul in the French Neo-Renaissance style. Since 1885, citizens have had the right to access the estate and hold events there. Additionally, Avoch benefited from the developments at Rosehaugh House, including the installation of water pipes and sewers, which greatly improved the village's hygienic conditions. Fletcher also had buildings erected for the residents and was involved in local sports and church decision-making bodies.\n\n\n=== Fletcher's heirs ===\nJames Douglas Fletcher died in 1927 without any descendants. His widow, Lilian Maud Stephen, inherited the estate. She commissioned the renowned architect Edwin Lutyens to create a monumental tomb and memorial for her late husband. In 1943, she put Rosehaugh up for sale but then took it off the market again. After Stephen died in 1953, the estate passed to her niece, Shaw-Mackenzie of Newhall, who sold it the following year. Previously, she donated various items from the interior and exterior to museums. The acquiring Eagle Star Insurance Co.'s main interest was Rosehaugh's farmland, which they wanted to continue to operate commercially or sell as parcelled land. At the time, considerable sums would have had to be invested to maintain the manor house. The clay tile roofing, which was not sufficiently resistant to the Scottish winters, instead of the usual slate roofing, would have been a significant and costly element of restoration. The manor house was demolished in 1959 as no buyer was found and the owners had no interest in preserving it. Before the demolition, an on-site auction was held to sell the inventory and items from the exterior of the property. The auction, organised by Thomas Love and Sons from Perth, was the largest ever held on the Black Isle. The items for sale included \"valuable English, Continental, Eastern and other furniture and furnishings\". Interior details, such as stucco ornaments and library shelves, were transferred to Novar House. Today, a modern villa stands on the site.\nBroadland Properties Ltd currently owns Rosehaugh with the aim of converting the preserved buildings into living, office, and retail space, as well as a kindergarten. The local population has been using the parkland for recreational purposes for years. Several outbuildings have been restored and are now rented out as private or holiday houses. In 2022, the local council approved the separation of 39 plots of land near Avoch for residential development.\n\n\n== Manor house ==\nThe manor house is situated 2.5 kilometres northwest of Avoch and 5 kilometres west of the harbour town of Fortrose. Inverness, known as the capital of the Highlands, is located 10 kilometres to the south. To the east, Rosehaugh once bordered the Avoch House estate, which was destroyed by a fire in 1833. The neo-Renaissance building exemplifies the magnificent architecture of the late Victorian era, with opulent and high-quality interior design that has been highly praised.\n\nThe literature only provides fragmentary descriptions of the architectural details of Flockart's Rosehaugh House. Flockart presented his designs to the Royal Academy of Arts after finalising the plans. The mansion was later featured in the trade journal The British Architect, despite being only an extension and reworking of an existing building. Despite this, the scale of Flockhart's commission was equivalent to that of a new building. The construction costs for the manor house itself amounted to around £60,000. S. D. Adshead was initially in charge of the work on site. However, he was replaced in 1901 by Flockhart's son-in-law, Leonard Rome Guthrie, who later achieved some prominence as an architect. Foster and Dicksee from Rugby, England, carried out the building work. Rosehaugh House is considered Flockhart's most extensive work.\n\nThe masonry consists of red sandstone blocks from a nearby quarry, while the grey granite used for accentuation was quarried on the estate. The building features numerous towers and balconies, including a striking main tower on the south façade topped with a leaden weather vane depicting a 1.8 metre long galleon with billowing sails.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nDuring Flockhart's extensive work, only high-quality building materials were used. The ground floor was renovated to include a new vestibule, smoking room, and billiard parlour. In the basement, a bathing area was created under a blue dome, lined with blue Persian tiles, and featuring a heated swimming pool, a Turkish bath, and an Italian drinking fountain. The interior of Rosehaugh House is characterized by mahogany and teak woodwork. The door frames and open fireplaces were ornate. An early central heating system was installed to control the temperature. It had a coal burner that heated the air, which was then blown into the various rooms through grilled outlets. The system consumed up to one tonne of coal per day. The manor house employed 28 servants to maintain operations, with additional labourers working in the estate's outdoor areas. The only remaining structure that was directly connected to Rosehaugh House is the former wine cellar (located at 57°34′21″N 4°12′42.2″W) which is now marked by the retaining wall on the slope of the terrace. This Tudor-Gothic building, dating from the late 19th century, is constructed into the hillside north of the manor house in the style of an ice cellar. Its masonry is made of polished ashlars, which also form the diamond-ornamented parapet of the flat roof. The five oak exterior doors are ornamented with St Andrew's crosses in the style of the Arts and Crafts Movement.\n\n\n== Gardens and parks ==\nThe gardens and parks at Rosehaugh suggest that George Mackenzie had driveways and service roads constructed around the manor house. However, there are few records of Rosehaugh's 17th and 18th century parks. James Fletcher was responsible for their extensive formalisation and further development. Ultimately, Rosehaugh House was surrounded by an elaborate landscape of formalised gardens and essentially wooded parkland. The regional natural environment is significantly enhanced by these features, which are a striking aspect of it. Historic Scotland has categorised Rosehaugh as an estate of outstanding landscape interest, reflecting this. The property is enclosed by a wall on three sides, with only the north side excluded, which is closed off topographically and by the moorland landscape of Shannon Wood. The formalised areas mainly extend to the south and north-west of the former manor house site. The downslope areas to the south are partly structured by stepping and terracing. The parks consist of various species, some natural and some afforested. The increasing diversity of species near Rosehaugh House is striking.\n\nThe ornamental centrepiece of the complex is an artificial lake of 2.4 hectares in the southern part, the surface of which is now reduced by the growth of reeds (position: 57°34′14.1″N 4°12′32.9″W). Its boathouse, built around 1900 (location: 57°34′15.3″N 4°12′32.2″W), has since been restored. Wood panelling covers much of the fieldstone masonry.The former pantiled roof is now covered with flat tiles. The fireplace and interior panelling survive. It is not known who designed the boathouse. However, it dates from Flockart's time. Another boathouse (West Lake Boathouse or Duck Lake Boathouse), also built around 1900, stands on the reservoir south-west of Rosehaugh House (location: 57°34′14″N 4°13′10.8″W). Its fieldstone walls are also largely timber-framed. The lounge on the upper floor has a wooden balcony on supporting beams extending along three sides. In the early 21st century the building, which had fallen into disrepair, was restored, extended and converted for residential use. The cross-gable added during this process is in keeping with the original style. The lake created by damming the Killen Burn was mainly used for hydroelectric power generation. The former generator house, which supplied electricity to the estate, is located below (at 57°34′10.1″N 4°12′58.2″W). After a dam burst in 1945 or 1946, the height of the dam and the area of the lake were reduced, which is reflected in the elevated position of the boathouse, which once stood directly on the lakeshore. Stylistic details suggest that Flockhart did not design the generator house, which was built around 1900. It has a roughly L-shaped floor plan. Polished and rusticated details contrast with the bossaged natural stone masonry. Various openings are closed by Tudor arches. Ventilation openings have been incorporated into the pyramidal roof of the southern arm. Water from the reservoir was channelled underground beneath the generator house, which has been converted into a holiday home as part of the restoration.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn the 1840s, James John Randoll Mackenzie had gardens laid out to the south-east of Rosehaugh House. Later, they were redesigned by Ross and Flockhart. The 2.4-hectare gardens are divided into two terraces. Ornamental gates are set into the surrounding quarry stone wall with concrete coping. The southern retaining wall seems to have been built in two phases. Flockhart provided supporting pillars and walled it up to a total height of three metres. The pilastered gates may have been decorated with old fragments from the manor house's remodelling. Photographs have preserved the layout of the gardens. A larger garden was situated to the east of the manor house, with heated greenhouses stretching along its entire northern wall (around 200 metres in length). A fernery, built during the end of the Pteridomania, was also included. The glasshouses' wooden framework was made of teak with bronze fittings, and the floors were decorated with mosaics. Mackenzie & Moncur, the manufacturer, used photographs of the greenhouses as representative models in its sales brochures. A row of cypress trees that once served as a hedge has been preserved at the southern end. The garden is now overgrown and provides little information about its former layout. A path separates the southern third, north of the dairy. The gardener's house, built around 1845 (location: 57°34′23.3″N 4°12′15.1″W), is situated to the east of the garden. The single-storey building is asymmetrically constructed with red stone blocks. The main entrance, located at an internal angle, has a simple bargeboard, just as the dormers, and a bevelled bay window protruding from the façade. An extension was later added on the southeast side, which has a slate roof.\n\n\n== Pathways and infrastructure ==\nA network of paths has been established over the centuries, connecting Rosehaugh House with various gates and outbuildings. The completion of the new state road (now the A832) in 1820 created a new main access route to the southwest. West Lodge, located off the road beyond the southwest gate, is approximately 1.3 kilometres south of Rosehaugh House (location: 57°33′41.8″N 4°13′5″W). The building was constructed in 1870 based on a design by Alexander Ross in the Italianate style. On the east side, there is a round-arched portal with an ornamental keystone on a projecting section. To the left of the portal, there are pilasters that flank a twin window with a baluster apron. The frieze below the corbels of the eaves cornice is decorated with triglyphs. The gable roof of the building is covered in slate. The gateway features four ornamented, urn-shaped pillars that border the central main path and the flanking pedestrian gates. Only the single-leaf flanking cast iron gates have survived. Fences on both sides are continued on low walls, corresponding to the design of the gates. To the west of the manor house, the path crosses the Killen Burn via a single-arch bridge (at 57°34′7.9″N 4°12′37.9″W). The fieldstone parapet of the building features polished natural stone details that curve on both sides. Additionally, the spandrels are rusticated.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe estate's infrastructure relies heavily on two main paths that run east–west. One path runs between the lake and the manor house, while the other passes the southern flank of the former manor house via the burnt-down Avoch House. Both paths end at Avoch. Due to acquisitions on the eastern flank, the east gate with East Lodge had to be relocated in 1871 to mark the new outer boundary of the estate. The new location was along the more southerly of the two paths (current location: 57°34′20.9″N 4°11′22.4″W). Alexander Ross planned the East Lodge, which was built in 1873 and remodelled by him three years later. On the more northerly path, Burnthouse (location: 57°34′23.2″N 4°10′59.4″W) stands out as a special feature. It was originally a wing of Avoch House, specifically the early 19th century farm wing that survived the devastating fire. The two-storey, three-axis wide building with corner risalits has harling plastered facades. To the right, a segmental arched gateway leads to the somewhat younger house behind it. The path crosses a water-bearing ditch near the gardener's house. The bridge (location: 57°34′22.1″N 4°12′9.9″W), which has a single arch, was constructed in the late 19th century and was later reworked by Alexander Ross in 1876 as part of the relocation of East Lodge. A decorative band surrounds the bridge's segmental brick arch, and its parapets curve outwards on both sides.\nJames Douglas Fletcher was the director of the Highland Railway for several years. During this period, a private halt was built along the branch line between Muir of Ord and Fortrose, located on the north side of the line to the south-west of Rosehaugh House. Passenger services on this line ceased in 1951, and freight services stopped in 1960.\n\n\n== Agriculture and livestock ==\nDuring the Mackenzie era, Rosehaugh had agricultural and livestock facilities that were typical for the region. In 1871, under James Fletcher's management, but before the significant expansion of agricultural activities, Rosehaugh House farmed 356 acres, generating £105 in revenue. James Douglas Fletcher reorganised and significantly expanded the economic activities, pursuing a subsistence farming approach to make the estate self-sufficient in all the food it needed. He furthered the development of farming methods and introduced non-native crops and livestock breeds. He also secured Rosehaugh's electricity supply by using water power. King George V's favourite horse, the highland pony Jock from Fletcher's stud, accompanied the royal coffin during his funeral procession. Rosehaugh's agriculture was recently valued highly. Eagle Star Insurance Co. purchased it, mainly for the agricultural facilities.\n\n\n=== Farmstead ===\nThe former farmstead is located near the bridge over the Killen Burn and the artificial lake, off the southern main road (coordinates: 57°34′9.4″N 4°12′24″W). around 1811. It was extended in the 1830s and 1840s, but unfortunately, a devastating fire in the 1960s destroyed most of the neoclassical complex, leaving only the eastern part preserved. Although it is not a listed building, it is included in the Buildings at Risk register. The former farmhouse was classified as being in poor condition and at moderate risk in 2013. In addition to living quarters, it had separate stable areas for horses, pigs, and dairy cows, as well as lamb rearing facilities. The complex also included general storage areas, feed barns, an engine house, and a heavy-duty weighbridge. The estate's gable roofs are covered with corrugated iron.\n\n\n=== Stables ===\nThe first stables on the estate, located a short distance to the west of Rosehaugh House, were probably built around 1810 by James Wemyss Mackenzie (location: 57°34′20.2″N 4°12′48.9″W). Over the following decades, they were extended and remodelled several times. In the mid-19th century, James John Randoll Mackenzie commissioned a significant extension to the complex. Another extension was carried out in 1874 according to plans by Alexander Ross. A modernisation was also carried out, last revised by Flockhart around 1900. Under Mackenzie, a U-shaped complex was created, with elongated buildings enclosing an inner courtyard on three sides, while the north-west facing front remained open. Today, only the eastern wing dates from this construction phase, while the western and northern parts of the building and the external western extension were either completed in 1874 or massively reworked. The complex now houses a series of workshops.\n\nThe buildings' brickwork is made up of uneven reddish stone blocks with polished surrounds and cornerstones. The newer side walls have various domed windows with stone mullions, while some of the older window openings on the eastern side have been closed with quarry stone masonry. On the south side, a risalit with a cross gable emerges from the seven-axis wide, but asymmetrically constructed structure, which ends on the right with a round tower with a conical roof. The northern flank of the building features a slate roof with dormers and a large chimney. The ornamentation includes motifs from the Arts and Crafts movement, which originated from Flockhart's reworking. The inner courtyard is covered by a modern roof.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe farmstead features a single-storey cottage from the mid-19th century, located south of the complex (position: 57°34′19.2″N 4°12′48.9″W). The south-facing main façade has three axes, with quatrefoils on either side of the central recessed entrance door. An unadorned cornice tops the entrance, resembling the architrave of an entablature. There were originally twelve-lite windows, but only partial remnants remain. The hip roof is covered with slate.\n\n\n=== The Dairy ===\nThe dairy is the most recent addition to Rosehaugh's buildings (located at 57°34′18.8″N 4°12′18.8″W). It was designed by Flockhart and constructed in 1907. The complex was solely dedicated to supplying the estate with dairy products and operated independently from the farmstead. The dairy had its own herd of Jersey cattle for milk production and carried out all steps involved in producing milk, butter, and cheese within the complex. During wartime, milk products were distributed to the population, although they were only intended to cover the needs of the estate. The dairy is the only building in Rosehaugh classified as a category A monument.\n\nThe complex is situated approximately 150 metres northeast of the lake, off the main road. The elongated building complex is designed in the spirit of the Arts and Crafts movement, featuring traditional architecture that is deliberately asymmetrical. It consists of one and two-story buildings that are subdivided into commercial and residential areas. Some of the building facades are harling plastered. The two cottages are connected by a colonnade of roughly hewn oak pillars, which is interrupted by a naïve portico. The plinths are designed with bossage work and the roofs are covered with red flat tiles.\n\n\n== Further external structures ==\n\n\n=== Gray's Cottage ===\nGray's Cottage (location: 57°34′25.5″N 4°12′52.4″W) is located approximately 200 metres north-west of the site of Rosehaugh House, north of the stables. It was built by Fletcher around 1900 as his servant's residence. The cottage is designed in the traditional English architectural style and decorated with Arts and Crafts motifs, by William Flockhart. The building has a striking flat tile and slate-covered gambrel roof with a wrought iron weather vane and a massive ridge chimney at the end of a flat cross gable. The eastern gable of the two-storey asymmetrically constructed building is adorned with a simple post-and-beam framework. The entrance door features a Tudor arch. The newer extensions at the rear of the building have been stylistically adapted to the existing architecture.\n\n\n=== Kennels Cottage ===\nKennels Cottage is the residential building of the huntsman (located at 57°34′29.7″N 4°12′43.2″W). It was built in the mid-19th century during the time of James John Randoll Mackenzie and is situated approximately 250 metres north of Rosehaugh House, in the wooded northern half of the estate. The Tudor-Gothic cottage was rebuilt around 1900 and has a single-storey L-shaped floor plan with a mansard roof. The cottage's fieldstone masonry features offset natural stone surrounds. The main section of the cottage has a higher elevation and is topped with a curved, slate-covered hipped roof with large hipped dormers. A veranda spans the rear inner corner diagonally, which may have been added later.  Additionally, there is an octagonal outer building that was used to mature the game.\n\n\n=== The Laundry ===\nThe former laundry, designed in the Arts and Crafts style with a bossaged plinth, is located approximately 500 metres west of the site of Rosehaugh House (coordinates: 57°34′22.8″N 4°13′14.4″W). The Ordnance Survey map from 1905 confirms its earlier date. Built around 1900 according to a design by Flockhart, the single-storey building with a mansard floor is asymmetrically constructed. The building is distinguished by its projecting gablet roof with truss gables and segmental-arched barrel dormers, extending like a catslide roof over the front door, serving as a canopy. A weather vane rises between the blind miniature cross gables. There is a small extension with a hipped roof attached to the north side. The building has been restored and, like the former boathouse, is now rented out as a holiday home.\n\n\n=== Fletcher Burial Enclosure ===\nFollowing his death in 1927, Fletcher's widow commissioned the construction of a tomb for both of them. The British architect Edwin Lutyens was entrusted with the design. The site, located approximately 350 metres northeast of Rosehaugh House on the edge of the former gardens (position: 57°34′29.4″N 4°12′28.8″W), is considered to be the northernmost of Lutyens' surviving buildings in the British Isles. The monument comprises a circular area enclosed by an ornamented wall. The interior is surrounded by a large stone balustrade that supports a stone bench running the length of the ring. The gateway, which breaks through the ring, features simple stone pillars, a double-leaf gate, and a wrought-iron arch decorated with rose ornaments and the initials JD and LF. On the opposite side, the tomb monument consists of a simple stone block with laurel bands. The centre of the plaque features a large circle with the inscription \"James Douglas Fletcher August 30, 1927 and Lilian Maud Augusta Stephen October 30, 1955\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nJohn Mills: Rosehaugh – A House of its Time.

        "content": "Riverside is a suburb of Mbombela in Mpumalanga, South Africa and is situated 4 km north of the Mbombela CBD. The suburb which is categorised as a City Improvement District (CID) is situated on the western banks of the Crocodile and Nels rivers.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe concept of Riverside was brought about in the early 1990s when Halls Properties realised the potential of the land. It also donated land to the Mpumalanga Provincial Government for the development of the new Provincial Government complex when Mbombela (then Nelspruit) obtained provincial capital status. The development of Riverside was also largely as a result of the need for additional land for light industrial development in Mbombela.\nThe development of two planned townships, Riverside Park and Riverside Industrial was approved in 1995. In November 2004, following a successful application, Riverside Park Phase 1 was established as a legalised City Improvement District. Later in 2009, Phase 1 became operational, and shortly after in March 2010, the municipal council of the City of Mbombela approved an amended business plan which expanded the previously legislated boundaries of its je Riverside Park CID to include both Phase 1 and 2. In 2015, Riverside Industrial City Improvement District (CID) was established as a separate CID after the application was approved by the city.\n\n\n== Riverside Industrial ==\nRiverside Industrial CID, situated south of the R37 and east of the R40, is a predominantly light-industrial suburb mainly comprising commercial land use.\n\n\n== Riverside Park ==\nRiverside Park CID is a mixed-use development mainly comprising a mixture of commercial, residential and retail land use. It is bordered by the Lowveld National Botanical Gardens to the east. The main thoroughfare through Riverside Park is the R40, also known as Madiba Drive, in which Phase 1 is situated east of Madiba Drive and Phase 2 is situated west thereof.\nThe area is anchored by four main developments:\n\nMpumalanga Provincial Government complex (includes Office of the Premier and provincial departments)\nRiverside Mall (one of the largest shopping centres in Mpumalanga)\nTsogo Sun's Emnotweni Casino\nSouthern Sun Mbombela\nOther significant developments or components of Riverside Park include The Grove Riverside Shopping Centre, Makro (The only Makro store in Mpumalanga) and the Lowveld National Botanical Garden (situated on the banks of the Crocodile River and east of Riverside Park).\n\n\n== Transport ==\nRiverside straddles along the R40 (Madiba Drive) connecting White River to the north with Barberton to the south. The R37 from Mashishing in the north-west terminates at the intersection with the R40 in Riverside.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Darlaston Town Hall is a municipal building in Victoria Road in Darlaston, a town in the West Midlands of England. The building, which is currently leased to a charity which manages local community activities, is a locally listed building.\n\n\n== History ==\nFollowing significant population growth, largely associated with the status of Darlaston as a market town, a local board of health was established the area in 1869. In 1881, the local board of health decided to commission a town hall to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. The site they selected, on Pardoes Lane, was occupied by a disused workhouse.\nThe foundation stone for the new building was laid by the chairman of the local board, James Slater of Bescot Hall, on 21 June 1887. It was designed by Jethro Cossins in the Queen Anne style, built in brick with stone dressings at a cost of £5,500 and was officially opened on 31 October 1888. However, further money had to be raised to complete the work.  The final stage of the complex, a public library, opened in September 1891.\nThe design involved a symmetrical main frontage of 13 bays facing onto Victoria Road, with the end sections of three bays each projected forward as pavilions. The central section of seven bays featured an elliptically headed doorway with voussoirs and a keystone flanked by pilasters supporting a parapet. The other bays on the ground floor were fenestrated by elliptically headed windows with voussoirs and keystones, while all the bays on the first floor were fenestrated by mullioned and transomed windows. At roof level, there was a central lantern with louvres and a finial. The end sections were fenestrated by mullioned and transomed windows with oculi in the gables above.\nIn 1895, the Local Board was succeeded by Darlaston Urban District Council, which used the town hall for its meetings.  In 1966, the district became part of the County Borough of Walsall, which used the building to house its social services department, while also making the main hall available for community events.  In 2012, a £500,000 restoration of the hall was proposed, but did not go ahead.  In 2017, the council leased the building to a local charity, Darlaston All Active.\n\n\n== The pipe organ ==\nBy 1903 the public hall was adorned with a fine new pipe organ, a gift to the town from the widow of James Slater, an ex-chairman of the local board, in his memory. The instrument was built by the West Yorkshire firm of J. J. Binns and was fully reported in the Musical Times. The organ is still in use. In June 2018 the Darlaston Town Hall pipe organ was recognised of outstanding national importance by the British Institute of Organ Studies (BIOS) – the UK's amenity society for pipe organs – and is listed as Grade 1 in the UK Historic Organs Scheme for being: an unaltered example of a town hall organ of 1903 by J. J. Binns and from the firm’s finest period.\n\n\n== References ==",

During the party's 2nd Extraordinary Congress on 16 May 1992, the party rebranded as the Christian-Peasant Party. In 1992, Artur Balazs, who was a representative of Rural Solidarity at the Round Table Agreement came to power in the party. In the Autumn of 1992, a \"rightwing\" splinter of SLCh defected to the National Party \"Fatherland\". On many issues, it closely aligned with the Conservative Party, which it later united with in 1997 to form the Conservative People's Party.\n\n\n== Ideology ==\nSLCh described itself as a center-right post-Solidarity party pledged to Christian and family values. It supported traditional multi-generational household farming, privatization involving a large amount of farmers, which would take control of the agriculture industry. It advocated for agrarian policies and government intervention in the matters of agriculture.\n\n\n== Electoral results ==\n\n\n=== Sejm ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "5 World Trade Center was a low-rise building in Lower Manhattan in New York City. Part of the World Trade Center complex, it boasted nine stories and was opened in March of 1972. The building was damaged during the September 11 attacks and later demolished. Its former site is now the location of the World Trade Center transportation hub and the proposed 2 World Trade Center.\n\n\n== History ==\n5 World Trade Center (5 WTC) was originally a steel-framed nine-story low-rise office building built in 1970–72 at New York City's World Trade Center. The building was designed by Minoru Yamasaki and Emery Roth & Sons. The structure was 118 ft (36 m) tall and had a black exterior. The building was L-shaped and occupied the northeast corner of the World Trade Center site. Overall dimensions were 330 by 420 feet (100 by 130 m), with an average area of 120,000 square feet (11,000 m2) per floor. It hosted a police desk.\nThe Chambers Street and World Trade Center (A, ​C, and ​E trains) subway stations were located directly east of the building, and one exit to the station was available through the lobby. The building's remaining underground concourse space housed The Mall at the World Trade Center. The largest Borders bookstore in New York City spread across three floors of 5 World Trade Center, on the corner of the building adjacent to the intersection of Church and Vesey Street.\nIn 1984, artist Joanna Gilman Hyde painted the 10,000-square-foot (930 m2) canvas titled \"Self Organizing Galaxy\" on the roof of 5 World Trade Center, a temporary art exhibit. It took eight days to paint and was signed on October 10, 1984.\n\n\n=== September 11 attacks ===\n5 WTC was the least damaged building of the entire complex. Floors 4–9 suffered partial collapse and/or fire damage as a result of the September 11 attacks, while Floors 1–3 were not damaged. The building's structural integrity on its upper floors were partially compromised due to the impact of steel and other debris from the North Tower. Other collapsed sections were due to fire damage. Portions of internal collapse and burnout were found on upper floors, mainly floors 6–8. The black exterior facade suffered severe fire damage. Floors 5–9 were on fire after the collapse of the South Tower. A section of the fuselage from United Airlines Flight 175 landed on the roof and a plane engine was found in the ninth floor cafeteria. The Borders bookstore was undamaged after both towers collapsed.\nThe building was demolished by weakening its internal structure and using cables to pull down the rest of the structure, the same way 4 and 6 World Trade Center were demolished. The last standing section of 5 WTC was removed by December 2001.\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)/ASCE Building Performance Study Team found that some connections between the structural steel beams failed in the fire. This was most apparent in the collapse of 5 World Trade Center, where the fireproofing did not protect the connections, causing the structure to fail. The structural failure didn't cause the entire building to collapse, as seen after the attacks that the structural skeleton remained intact.\nThe building was the location of the Survivors' Staircase, which was moved 200 feet along Vesey Street in 2008 to prevent further damage. In 2010, the staircase was placed inside the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, where it resides today.\n2 World Trade Center will stand at the exact location where the original 5 World Trade Center once stood.\n\n\n== Tenants ==\nThe following is a list of tenants of 5 World Trade Center prior to its destruction:\n\nThe Satellite Airlines Counter, in the Plaza Level, was a retail space where airlines would lease out \"booths\" to house airline services. Tenants included Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Inc., US Airways, and many others. Courier tenants included FedEx Corporation and DHL. The space was located adjacent to the lower floor of the three-floor Borders Bookstore.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Lilla Torg (\"Little Square\") is a square in Gamla Staden (the Old Town) in central Malmö, Sweden. It is located right next to Stortorget. There are a number of restaurants around the square and in the summer it is full of people on the outdoor terraces. The municipality used to build a skating rink on the square, but this has now been moved to Stortorget.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nDuring the latter half of the 16th century, \"a large wasteland\" is mentioned southwest of Stortorget. At this time the area was low-lying and does not seem to have been attractive for building. Only after filling it in was Lilla torg, an extension of Stortorget, created in the 1590s. This is where burghers' wives and maids went to buy their daily household goods. On the west side of the square, people crowded around the meat counters, while the bakers on the south side of the square offered freshly baked bread. Along the eastern side of the square were the fishmongers and in the north the hawkers, the grocers. The small stalls of the hawkers and fishmongers disappeared in the 18th century and were replaced by real houses. Lilla torg was being swallowed up by permanent buildings. Around the turn of the century 1900 there used to be older small so-called square-houses placed on the square itself. They were replaced by a market hall built in 1902–1903 after drawings by Salomon Sörensen. The market hall was built in a Gothic Revival style in red brick and covered the entire square. In the 1960s, a so-called cultural environment project was carried out. The market hall was demolished in 1968 and the entire area of Lilla Torg was now opened up to its original extent.\nSouth of the square is Hedmanska gården (The Hedman Farm), an old half-timbered farm dating back to the 1590s. Inside the farm is the Form/Design Center, with a gallery and exhibitions. Next to Hedmanska gården, on the other side of Hjulhamnsgatan, is the Faxeska huset (The Faxe House) from the 1760s.\nToday there are two half-timbered houses on the western side of the square. The corner house, Ekströmska huset, was built in the 1720s, while the adjacent house, Aspegrenska huset, despite its old appearance, is newly built. Sculpted parts, however, date back to the 17th century. The brick building in the northwest corner of the square was built in the 19th century as a factory and served for a while as a market hall, but is now a 5-star hotel. The street that used to run along the western side of the square was called Torggatan (the eastern one was called Östra Torggatan) - these street names disappeared in 1969. At the same time, Landbygatan and Larochegatan, which previously ran along the north and south sides of the square, were shortened and the whole area is now called Lilla Torg.\nThe square fountain by artist Thure Thörn was added in 1973. The reliefs on the fountain show symbols of the square's four old traders' professions. Lilla Torg's football team is called Lilla Torg FF and plays at Mariedals IP.\n\n\n=== Sweden's most beautiful square ===\nIn 2021 the association Arkitekturupproret (Architectural Rebellion) organized an online vote for Sweden's most beautiful square. They nominated 101 squares, aiming for a geographical spread and distribution across different sizes of town. The vote was then held on Facebook with a participation of 25,000. Lilla Torg in Malmö won (1611 votes). Karlskrona's Stortorget came in second (1191 votes).\n\n\n== References ==",

He is also a translator, involved in the reception of French Phenomenology into English, and a novelist.\nHis novel, Outside the Gates, retells the true story of Jewish existentialist philosopher Jean Wahl's escape from Drancy Internment Camp and underground flight to the Free zone during the German Occupation of France in 1941. Hackett is the translator of Wahl's Human Existence and Transcendence, published in 1944 after his escape, that is partially retold by the novel.\nHackett is a professor of philosophy at Saint Meinrad Seminary and School of Theology in St. Meinrad, Indiana.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n=== Fiction ===\nOutside the Gates, Angelico Press, 2021.

        "content": "Doreen Chadwick (7 August 1918 – 26 June 2014) was a British pianist and theatre organist. She was known for being the organist at the Odeon and Gaumont cinemas in Manchester, broadcasting organ recitals on BBC Radio, including on the The Organist Entertains, and for her performances in the US, Holland, and Britain.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nDoreen Chadwick was born on 7 August 1918 in Maesycoed, Pontypridd, Wales to father Wyndham Chadwick (20 June 1890 – 4 November 1955), an engine driver on the GWR, and mother Alice Maud (née Dagg, 6 June 1895 – 23 September 1970), a harmonium player. Chadwick, the eldest of her siblings, lived with her family in Rosser Street, Maesycoed, and attended Pontypridd Intermediate Girls' School.\nChadwick started playing the piano at the age of seven and, in January 1929, at the age of ten, she passed her primary grade in piano. However, her love of Reginald Dixon made her give up the piano and focus on the church organ, playing at the Parish Church in Pontypridd. She played the \"straight\" organ and carried on with lessons, taking her ALCM diploma at the age of 16. She practiced on a concert-type organ at the Palladium, Pontypridd.\nAfter leaving school, Chadwick worked as a short-hand typist while continuing to train to be an organist. By 1930, the family had moved to Tel-el-Kebir Road, Hopkinstown, before settling in South Street, Abercynon, four years later, where her mother lived until her death in 1970.\nIn June 1935, at the age of 16, Chadwick won first prize for pipe organ solos at the Urdd Eisteddfod (the Annual Welsh-language youth festival) at Carmarthen. The following year, in 1936, she was awarded the gold medal, then the silver in 1937, and then gold medal again in 1938 and 1939 at the Railwaymen's Eisteddfod held in Reading, judged by Sir Walford Davies.\nOn 8 June 1937, at the age of 18, Chadwick commenced a series of organ recitals which were broadcast on BBC Radio from St Catherine's Church, Pontypridd, becoming the youngest female organist to broadcast straight recitals. Chadwick gave her second recital on 21 May 1938 from St Catherine's Church.\nChadwick learned to play the cinema organ at the Castle Cinema, Merthyr Tydfil, under the tuition of Gene Lynn.\n\n\n== Career ==\nChadwick's first job was as resident organist at the Rex Cinema, Aberdare, between July 1940 and September 1941. She made three appearances per day, at 3 pm, 6pm and 9 pm, on the Compton Theatrone, each segment 20 minutes long. She then moved to the Granada circuit in London, starting at their premier theatre in Tooting as an assistant organist. Chadwick toured with Granada around London and the provinces for four years. She continued to play in London throughout the Second World War, often to the sound of bombs dropping.\nAfter the war Chadwick joined the Associated British Cinemas circuit and toured the country. She made her debut at the Savoy Cinema, Leicester, where she remained for two years. In August 1947, Chadwick broadcast on the Home service from the Ritz Cinema in Richmond and in December of the same year, she broadcast on the BBC Theatre Organ on the Light Programme, by which time she had been a cinema organist for eight years. She then turned to electronic organs, and started playing a Hammond organ at the Lyons' Corner House in Tottenham Court Road, London, replacing organist Ena Baga. On Chadwick's days off, Baga would deputise for her. Chadwick continued in this role for 14 months, before leaving London.\nDuring the 1950s, while courting her future husband, Leonard Wiles, Chadwick went to view a pipe organ in a Shepherd's Bush pub, in west London. She started playing the two manual organ, with pipes going into the beer cellar, occasionally deputising for the regular organist. It was here that Chadwick was spotted and offered a job in Oldham, Lancashire.\nChadwick, with her husband, moved to Oldham and spent three years at the Market Hotel, before taking on the Magnet Hotel. Chadwick installed a Hammond RT3 organ, drawing in customers from as far as Blackpool and Halifax. During her time at the Magnet Hotel, Chadwick broadcast from the Odeon and Gaumont in Manchester, where she deputised for Stanley Tudor at the latter. After eight years at the Magnet, the couple took over the Gardner's Arms in Middleton for 12 months, before returning to the Magnet for a further three years. Chadwick then played the organ at the British Legion Club in Higher Blackley for 11 years, before she began to wind down her performing.\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s Chadwick appeared as an early guest on the BBC radio programme The Organist Entertains. In 1977, Chadwick, along with Baga, represented women organists at the Odeon, Leicester Square, London, in celebration of the Queen's Silver Jubilee. The following year, Chadwick became the first woman to perform in concert for The North Wales Organ Society at the Metropole Hotel in Colwyn Bay. In July 1981, she accompanied Cerys Hughes-Taylor at the Gaumont State Theatre in Hammersmith, to an audience of 3,500 including Prince Charles and Lady Diana.\nShe recorded a number of LPs, and made recordings on the Gaumont, Manchester, the Christie organ at the Regal, Edmonton, and the Wurlitzer in the Free Trade Hall, Manchester. Chadwick played at the Hulme Hippodrome, where her recitals were recorded and broadcast by the BBC. Chadwick played many organs for meetings of theatre organ societies around the country as cinemas were disposing of their organs and redundant theatre organs were being installed by societies in village halls, church halls and private residences.\nDuring the 1990s Chadwick continued to give concerts for societies at regional theatre organs such as the American Theatre Organ Society's Christie Theatre Organ at the Barry Memorial Hall, for the Mid Glamorgan Organ Society at the Lindsay Constitutional Club, for the Cinema Organ Society at the New Ritz ballroom Brighouse, and at the Clydebank Town Hall.\nIn April 2007 Chadwick, along with Len Rawle and Kevin Morgan, gave the reopening concert of the Granada Tooting Wurlitzer to an audience of over one thousand. Chadwick announced her retirement while seated at the console of the Compton/Christie organ in the Town Hall, Ossett, on 1 June 2008.\nChadwick's signature tune was called \"Doreen\", and composed by Tony Lowrey. She had over 200 broadcasters to her name and was nicknamed the \"Princess of the Theatre Organ\". She was the vice-president of the Lancastrian Theatre Organ Trust and President of the Cinema Organ Society.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nChadwick married Leonard Wiles (26 January 1908 – 5 November 2006) in 1951 in Ealing, west London, before the couple settled in the north of England in 1952. Wiles was a bandsman in the 4th Hussars, playing clarinet and saxophone. The couple settled in Alkrington, near Middleton in Lancashire.\nWiles died on 5 November 2006, aged 98. Chadwick died on 26 June 2014, aged 95. Nigel Ogden presented a tribute edition of The Organist Entertains devoted to her, which was broadcast on BBC Radio 2 in July 2014.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nChadwick's signature tune, \"Doreen\", by Tony Lowrey",

        "content": "The Tri City Speedway was a 1/2 mile dirt track located in High Point, North Carolina; built by brother Bill Blair and Bob Blair. According to an article from Speed Age (Aug 1947 vol. 1 no. 4) the surface had been scarified and \"many tons of used motor oil had been sprayed into the dirt\" to make the track dustless. The inaugural race, the Piedmont Championship, took place June 29, 1947 with Fonty Flock on the pole with Jimmie Lewallen coming in for a controversial win following a yellow flag condition.\nThe track also hosted two NASCAR Grand National races. A 200 lap race held on June 26, 1953 (race 1953-17) with Herb Thomas winning, and another 200 lap race on November 7, 1955 (race 1955-01) with Lee Petty taking the win.\nA historical marker was placed near the site of the original track on July 18, 2016 at the intersection of Skeet Club Road and Lumsden Lane.\n\n\n== References ==",

Well-versed in languages and study of ancient monuments, Francesco joined his father  in selling off Giuseppe's estates and collections to cure the family's dire financial issues. All its ancient statues were sold to an English physician for 1,100 ducats, as well as 45 Etruscan vases and the library to the Oratorians in Naples for 14,000 ducats.\nHe studied law from 1698 to 1702, graduating in 1711. He became a great friend of Matteo Egizio and kept up a long correspondence with Ludovico Antonio Muratori. He wrote many poems in Latin, ancient Greek and Italian which were published in several collections during his lifetime. In 1755 he and fourteen others were chosen to found the Accademia Ercolanese. He was initially also going to be its permanent secretary, but his age and failing health meant he could not keep up that role, ceding it to  Pasquale Carcani.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n(in Italian) Giuseppe Niccolò F.

        "content": "Rape by proxy is a type of rape where in an attacker makes use of another individual to physically assault the victim.\n\n\n== Types ==\n\n\n=== Coercing someone to have sex with a third party ===\n\nIn September 2007 a Utah woman raised in the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints brought to court a rape by proxy case against the church leader Warren Jeffs whom she claims coerced her to marry her 19-year-old cousin and have sex with him when she was 14 years old. Jeffs was convicted on the charge.\n\n\n=== Rapist hired ===\n\n\n=== Rapist under duress ===\nPersons being forced to rape is a phenomenon researched in the Democratic Republic of the Congo where cases of forced incestuous assaults have been attested to by victims of rape during war times, these events mainly happen after a gang rape and entail fathers being forced to assault their daughters and sons forced to assault their mothers. Among acts of sexual violence in the Tigray War in Ethiopia and Eritrea has been reported cases of men and boys being forced to rape their family members under threats of violence or death.\n\n\n=== Rapist mislead ===\nIn 2014 in Prince George's County, Maryland, a woman and her daughters were the victim of several attempted assaults by men who were contacted by fake social media contacts posing to be the woman asking them to come to her home to engage in rape fantasies. An investigation revealed that it was the woman's ex-husband who had orchestrated the events. Brian Frosh and Kathleen Dumais of The Baltimore Sun noted that \"though her ex-husband was eventually brought to justice, prosecutors were forced to cobble together a lengthy list of charges to accumulate a sentence that would fit this novel crime\" and that the phenomenon is not unique and needs new legislation to handle. They also state that rape by proxy by misleading solicitations online is a unique type of conspiracy as \"the recruiters and recruits never meet, never exchange anything of value and may never even communicate directly at all\". As a result of this case the state senate passed a bill outlawing \"posting information about another person advertising that they would welcome being sexually assaulted\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nOutline of sexual ethics\nForced prostitution\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMardorossian, Carine M.

        "content": "Abdool Cader Kalla, also known by his pen name A.C. Kalla, is an Indo-Mauritian educator, geographer, and historian known for his contributions to academia and involvement in educational and cultural initiatives in Mauritius. With studies in geography and education, Kalla has made strides in promoting intercultural understanding, environmental awareness, and historical scholarship.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAbdool Cader Kalla was born in Rose Hill, Mauritius on January 17, 1941. He comes from an Indo-Mauritian Muslim heritage. His ancestors migrated from Gujarat, India in the 19th century to Mauritius during British rule.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAbdool Cader Kalla served as an Associate Professor of Didactics and Geography at the Mauritius Institute of Education (MIE), where he also held the position of deputy director. His expertise extended to the Geography of Health, an area of study in which he demonstrated a keen interest. During his tenure at the MIE, Kalla authored the environmental chapter of educational materials and co-directed the Teachers and Intercultural Education initiative, emphasizing the importance of multiculturalism and sensitization in educational practices.\nIn addition to being a professor, in the 1980s, Kalla served as vice-president of the National Remuneration Board (NRB), which set salary guidelines for the private sector. Ivan Collendaveloo led the body and was followed by the late Ewam Juggernauth.\nBeyond his academic endeavors, Kalla was actively involved in shaping broadcasting policies in Mauritius. He assumed the role of President of the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), succeeding Ashok Radhakissoon in 2004.\nIn addition to his academic and administrative roles, Kalla has also been recognized for his contributions to cultural heritage. He has served as the Chairman of the Mauritius Museums Council.\n\n\n== Contributions ==\nAs a historian, Kalla has delved into the complexities of Mauritius' colonial past, particularly focusing on the evolution of the Muslim community during both French and British colonial rule. His analyses are intended to provide insights into the socio-cultural dynamics that have shaped Mauritius over the centuries and contribute to a better understanding.\n\n\n== Publications ==\n\nPapers published on Academia:\n\nKalla, Abdool Cader (1993). \"The inequalities of morbidity and mortality in Mauritius—its ethic and geographic dimension\".

        "content": "Carlo Celano (22 February 1625 – 3 December 1693) was an Italian lawyer and man of letters, who led the restoration of the church of Santa Restituta in his birthplace of Naples and left an accurate census of the city's monuments, updated up to the end of the 17th century.\n\n\n== Life ==\nBorn to Antonia Picaccia and her doctor husband Salvatore, he inherited a taste for architecture, history and art from his father, expanding it by  long journeys through Naples and excursions to its catacombs. He studied under his father and the Jesuits before graduating from university in law. He immediately began both to work as a lawyer and to write poetry and prose. He was forced to give up his legal job due to an incident in court and suspicions that he had taken part in the Masaniello revolt - the latter led him to be imprisoned in Naples' gaol, the Vicaria, until an influential friend secured his release.\nAround 1660 he decided to take religious vows and to enter the congregation of the apostolic missions in Naples. He immediately took on positions of responsibility and soon archbishop Ascanio Filomarino made him a canon of Naples Cathedral. He continued writing and publishing under the pseudonym 'Ettore Calcolona', especially stage comedies inspired by Lope de Vega, Calderòn de la Barca and other Spanish writers, which he published to some acclaim. His satire Degli avanzi delle Poste, in which he imagined publishing letters that were never delivered and mounted up at post offices, was a sharp critique of fashions and social behaviour at the time. He also moved in cultural circles, visiting Luca Giordano's studio and hosting lawyer Francesco Valletta's intellectual salons, at which he met the historian Jean Mabillon, for whom he acted as cicerone during Mabillon's grand tour and by whom he his mentioned as an expert on ancient Naples. Celano became involved in fundraising to repair Santa Restituta after the 5 June 1688 earthquake and in mid 1689 he was chosen to join its repair committee and put in charge of the works - the reopening occurred on 24 May 1692. Celano died in Naples in 1693.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n=== Notizie ===\nAt the same time as the restoration work he published his most important work,Le Notizie del bello, dell'antico e del curioso della città di Napoli (Notices on what is beautiful, ancient and curious in the city of Naples), dedicated to Pope Innocent XII. The work's main aim was to describe ten itineraries for foreign visitors to the city. It was a true guidebook, based on immense research and minutely describing culture, art and architecture in the city, with especial attention to non-religious buildings.\nIt went through three editions in the 17th century alone, with one more in the 18th century, edited by Giovanbattista Chiarini. That last edition was last reprinted in 2000 and moved the work's authorship more towards Chiarini himself, using Celano's work as a basic structure for his own. A critical edition of the most substantial 18th century reprint, that of 1792, has recently been edited by Gianpasquale Greco, also containing all the additions (i.e. the updates) of the other two 18th century reprints and also including the Notizie sulle reali ville (an 18th-century text supplementing the 1792 edition, dedicated to the royal foundations in the Bourbon era).\n\n\n=== Other works ===\nNon è padre essendo Re\nGli effetti della cortesia\nDell'amare l'ardire\nLa pietà trionfante\nLa forza della fedeltà\nDegli avanzi delle Poste\nCorso Politico nei Ginnasi Delphici del Gran Alfonso Primo Re di questo nome in Napoli\nLettere Spirituale e Morale in diversi soggetti\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The  Municipal Association Group  (known as MAG, and as the Hull Municipal Association) was a municipal political party in Kingston upon Hull, England, which existed from 1934 to 1963.\nThe Labour Party won control of Hull Corporation in 1934. In the same year the Municipal Association was established 'to combat socialist domination', advertising against 'socialist (mis)rule'. The Association grew out of the former \"Independent Group\", and included both Liberals and Conservatives. In the early years there was a tendency to refer to the association as the \"Hull Municipal Association (1934)\".\nIn 1938, together with Independents, the Municipal Association won control, retaining it until 1945. Towards the end of its existence, the Municipal Association was largely Conservative-dominated and from 1960 Liberal candidates stood separately from the MAG. In 1963 the rupture between Liberals and Conservatives became permanent, and the Association merged into the Hull Conservative Federation. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Einzeln sein. Eine philosophische Herausforderung (lit. 'Being Separate: A Philosophical Challenge') is a 2021 book by the German philosopher Rüdiger Safranski. It is about individuality, which it covers by portraying historical thinkers from the Renaissance to the 20th century.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nSafranski presents an intellectual history of being alone and the tension between being an individual and belonging to a society. The book contains 16 chapters or essays that portray people from the Renaissance until the middle of the 20th century, focusing their attempts to discover and cultivate their individuality. Among the people portrayed are Martin Luther, Michel de Montaigne, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Denis Diderot, Søren Kierkegaard, Stefan George, Jean-Paul Sartre, Karl Jaspers, Hannah Arendt, Ernst Jünger and Ricarda Huch.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nJens Balzer of Deutschlandfunk Kultur wrote that the book is entertaining and clever, and manages to give a sense of intellectual evolution without trying to force its subjects into a conceived progress. Balzer wrote that the book showcases Safranski's skill at combining biography with philosophical considerations. He criticised the book's historical scope, as its chronology ends with Jünger's The Forest Passage from 1951, thus omitting important later developments even in the thinkers it portrays. Thomas Ribi of the Neue Zürcher Zeitung wrote that the chapters about Stendhal, Kierkegaard and Huch are masterpieces. Ribi wrote that although Safranski avoids generalisation, there is a theme about the individual's need to belong to a society while at the same time life cannot be too limited by belonging.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHanser",

It was placed on a \"yellow list\" due to the damage and the building was fully repaired.The building was again heavily damaged on 3 April 2024 during the 2024 Hualien earthquake, which left the building tilted over at a 25 degree angle.

        "content": "Dennis O'Bryen (1755 – 13 August 1832) was an Irish dramatist and political pamphleteer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nO'Bryen was born in Ireland in 1755, became a surgeon, but relinquished the practice of his profession and settled in London, where he distinguished himself as a zealous political partisan of Fox, with whom he was on terms of great intimacy. The work which first brought him into notice was an ironical ‘Defence of the Earl of Shelburne from the Reproaches of his numerous Enemies, in a Letter to Sir George Saville, bart., to which is added a Postscript addressed to the Earl of Stair’ relative to his pamphlet on the state of the public debt, London, 1782, 8vo; 2nd ed. 1783. He next wrote ‘A Friend in Need is a Friend indeed,’ a three-act comedy performed at the Haymarket Theatre on 5 July 1783, but not printed. The cast included Palmer, Edwin, Parsons, Baddeley, and Mrs. Inchbald. This play, which in some respects resembled Oliver Goldsmith's ‘The Good-Natur'd Man,’ was acted eight times, but did not meet with a very cordial reception, and it gave rise to a newspaper controversy between the author and George Colman, the manager of the theatre (Baker, Biogr. Dramatica, 1812, i. 545, ii. 252; Genest, vi. 281).\nIn 1784 he published another ironical work, entitled ‘A Gleam of Comfort to this distracted Empire, demonstrating the Fairness and Reasonableness of National Confidence in the present Ministry’—meaning the ministry of Pitt. About the same time he published two papers, called ‘The Reasoner,’ which subsequently appeared in several compilations, the first being attributed by the compiler to Lord Erskine, and the second to Sheridan. In 1786 he printed ‘A View of the Commercial Treaty with France,’ negotiated by William Eden, afterwards Lord Auckland. This was followed by ‘Lines written at Twickenham,’ 1788, in which year, immediately upon the king's illness, he published anonymously ‘The Prospect before us, being a Series of Papers upon the great Question [i.e. of the regency] which now agitates the Public Mind.’ This was reproduced under the title of ‘The Regency Question,’ with a new preface, in consequence of the discussions caused by the return of his majesty's malady in 1810. In 1796 he published ‘Utrum Horum? The Government or the Country?’ which rapidly passed through three editions.\nUpon the change of ministry in 1806 he succeeded to the lucrative sinecure of deputy paymaster-general, and in the same year he was appointed by Fox to the patent office of marshal of the admiralty at the Cape of Good Hope, worth, it was said, 4,000l. per annum. He died at Margate on 13 August 1832. He had resided in London in Craven Street, Strand. His political correspondence was sold by auction a year or two after his death.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Cooper, Thompson (1895). \"O'Bryen, Dennis\".

Yard number 291 was launched on 6 July as Victorian, and completed on 31 August. Yard number 292 was launched on 25 July as Armenian, and completed on 19 September. Yard number 296 was launched on 21 September as Cestrian, and completed on 5 March 1896.\nCestrian's registered length was 512.5 ft (156.2 m), her beam was 59.2 ft (18.0 m), and her depth was 35.0 ft (10.7 m). She had capacity for at least 900 head of cattle and 50 passengers. Her tonnages were 8,761 GRT and 5,711 NRT.  When new, Victorian, Armenian, and Cestrian were noted for being of \"exceptionally large tonnage\" among newly built ships, second only to White Star Line's Georgic. Cestrian had a single screw, driven by a three-cylinder triple-expansion engine that was rated at 718 NHP and gave her a speed of about 13 knots (24 km/h). She also had four masts, and could be rigged as a schooner.\nLeyland registered Cestrian at Liverpool. Her United Kingdom official number was 105372 and her code letters were PGDH.\n\n\n== 1890s ==\n\nOn 11 March 1896 Cestrian left Liverpool on her maiden voyage, which was to Boston. Her Master was Captain Trant, who was Commodore of the Leyland fleet. Liverpool – Boston was her regular scheduled route. Her cargoes to Boston included wool and Egyptian cotton.\nOn 22 May 1898 Cestrian left Liverpool for Boston with 28 passengers. On 27 May she was steaming at reduced speed through fog when she struck an iceberg at position 43°40′N 48°15′W. The collision crushed and twisted her bow on her port side for a distance of 20 feet (6 m). Captain Trant ordered her lifeboats swung out on their davits, but she remained afloat, and she reached Boston on 31 May.\n\n\n== Second Boer War ==\nOn 23 November 1899 the Admiralty chartered Cestrian as Transport Number 71 for the Second Boer War. E Thmas had succeeded Captain Trant as her Master. She was engaged on 1 December, and on the afternoon of 21 December she left Southampton carrying 28 officers, two warrant officers, 764 men, and 479 horses. They included 165 men and 161 horses of the 14th King's Hussars; 179 men, 196 horses six field guns and an ammunition train of 11 vehicles of the Royal Horse Artillery; 210 men of the 2nd Battalion, the Royal Scots Fusiliers; 50 men of the Royal Welch Fusiliers; 25 men of the Post Office Corps; and a party of the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC). On 28 December she called at Las Palmas; on 6 January she called at Durban in Natal; and on 10 January she reached Cape Town in Cape Colony.\nOn 23 January the Admiralty returned Cestrian to her owners. She had been chartered for 53 days, of which 21 were at sea. Her charter was the shortest of all of the transport ships in that war. For this, the Admiralty paid Leyland £49,845 for the charter, fittings, bunkering, and port dues.\nBy May 1900 Cestrian was back on her merchant route between Liverpool and Boston. On 7 July she left New York on a new service, carrying passengers and 200 head of cattle. However, by 5 September she was back on her route between Liverpool and Boston.\n\nOn 15 April 1902 Cestrian arrived in Boston, where the Admiralty chartered her again. On 8 May she left Halifax, Nova Scotia, carrying the 3rd Regiment, Canadian Mounted Rifles and two squadrons of the 4th Regiment, Canadian Mounted Rifles. As she left port, the Austro-Hungarian Navy cruiser SMS Szigetvár dipped her flag in salute. Cestrian called at Cape Town on 30–31 May, and reached Durban on 4 June. None of them saw active service. On 1 July she re-embarked 40 officers and 1,599 men of the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th Battalions, Canadian Mounted Rifles; on 2 July she left Point Natal; and on 29 July she reached Halifax.\nOn 12 September 1902 Cestrian left South Africa carrying 1,880 officers and men. They included 17 officers and 519 men of the 3rd Battalion, the Lincolnshire Regiment; 17 officers and 532 men of the 3rd Battalion, the Essex Regiment; 17 officers and 524 men of the 4th Battalion, the Royal Dublin Fusiliers; three officers and 85 men of U Battery, Royal Horse Artillery; two officers and 66 men of the Royal Field Artillery; one RAMC surgeon, and two civilian surgeons. She called at Queenstown (now Cobh) in Ireland on 2 October, and reached Southampton on 5 October. By 30 October Cestrian was in Boston, back on her regular route.\n\n\n== 1900s ==\nBy November 1903 the cargo holds of Cestrian and several other Leyland ships had been fitted with an electric fan ventilation system. This could keep them cool enough to carry cargoes such as apples. It could also be used to keep the holds at a temperature comfortable for cattle. In August 1904 Cestrian carried a record cargo of 1,157 head of cattle.\nBy 1907 Cestrian seems also to have had some refrigerated capacity, as at Liverpool that November she landed 1,420 boxes of pork; 1,739 boxes of beef; and 1,651 quarters of beef, as well as 899 head of live cattle. On 18 December that year she left New York for London carrying 750 head of cattle and 1,400 quarters of beef. On 3 January 1908 she left London, and on 16 January she arrived in New York again. By August 1908 she was back on her usual route between Liverpool and Boston.\n\n\n== 1910s ==\nBy 1910 Cestrian was equipped with wireless telegraphy, supplied and operated by the Marconi Company. In the 1910s Cestrian's work became more varied. In late September or early October 1912 she left Galveston, Texas carrying 24,500 bales of cotton for Liverpool. On 10 October 1913 she left Pensacola, Florida for New Orleans.\nOn 13 December 1913 Cestrian passed Sand Key heading west into the Gulf of Mexico. On her return west on 24 December she rescued the Master and all eight crew of the British barquentine Malwa, which was foundering in a heavy sea. USRC Miami took the survivors off Cestrian, and on 26 December landed them at Key West, Florida. On 26 December Cestrian passed Sand Key again returning east.\nBy 1914 Cestrian's wireless call sign was MHL. On 28 March 1914 Cestrian left Liverpool for New York, where she was due on 11 April. On 9 April she radioed to that she was 500 nautical miles (930 km) east of Sandy Hook, New Jersey.\n\n\n== First World War ==\nBy 8 August 1914 the Admiralty had either requisitioned or chartered Cestrian for war service. On 2 February 1915 she left New Orleans for Avonmouth carrying about 1,000 jacks to breed mules for war service. Between October 1914 and February 1915, an estimated 7,000 to 8,000 mules had been exported through New Orleans to Britain.\n\nIn June 1917 Cestrian left Salonica (now Thessaloniki) in Greece with horses and 800 troops for Alexandria in Egypt. Two warships escorted her. At 09:30 hrs on 24 June UB-42 torpedoed her in the Aegean 4 nautical miles (7 km) southeast of Skyros, killing her Fourth Engineer and two stokers. \"Splendid discipline\" ensured that all her troops and the remainder of her crew abandoned ship without further loss of life. She sank at 14:00 hrs.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nCorbett, Julian; Newbolt, Henry (1928). The Naval History of the Great War: Based on Official Documents. Vol. IV.

        "content": "Whitehills Lifeboat Station is a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboat station located in Whitehills, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. \nThe lifeboat station in this part of Aberdeenshire has been located in various locations in Banff & Macduff, and between 1923 and 1969, the lifeboat was located at Whitehills, three miles to the west of Macduff. \nSupporters and volunteers treat the station as 'one', regardless of the location. The current Macduff Lifeboat Station became operational in March 1974. \n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1859, Capt. MacDonald, Commander of H.M. Coastguard, Banff, responded to the RNLI, who at the time were keen to place more lifeboats on the coast of Scotland.\nWith the support of the Banff Harbour Trustees, he gained considerable support locally, and the RNLI placed a lifeboat at Banff in 1860.\nFor earlier history, please see\n\nBanff and Macduff Lifeboat Station\n\nIn 1923, the Banff and Macduff lifeboat was relocated to Whitehills Harbour, with the station name changed to Whitehills Lifeboat Station in 1924. \nPreviously located at the east end of Banff Bridge, the move to Whitehills was made primarily for crew reasons. The fishermen of Banff & Macduff, with their steam-powered vessels, were usually fishing further away from home, and were not always available to crew the lifeboat if required. The fishermen in Whitehills however, fished a lot closer to home, making them more available to crew the lifeboat. A stone built boathouse was constructed in Whitehills in 1833.\nAfter 45 years, with lifeboat cover to the West and East provided by Buckie and Fraserburgh, it was decided to withdraw the All-weather lifeboat, and the Whitehills station was closed in 1969.\nThe building is listed, and now a private residence.\nThe 1969 decision to withdraw the All-weather lifeboat was reversed in 1974, and the station was re-established, but located at Macduff.\nFor later history, please see\n\nMacduff Lifeboat Station\n\n\n== Whitehills lifeboats ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of RNLI stations\nList of former RNLI stations\nRoyal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboats\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMacduff Lifeboat Station\nMacduff Lifeboat Facebook Page.",

        "content": "Very few 19th Century glassmaking innovations in the United States happened at the beginning of the century. Only ten glass manufacturers are thought to have been operating in 1800. High-quality glassware was imported from England, and glassmaking knowledge was kept secret. England controlled a key ingredient for producing high–quality glassware and kept its price high—making it difficult for American glass manufacturers to compete price-wise. European glassmakers with the knowledge to produce high–quality glassware were, in some cases, smuggled to the United States. Eventually the American glass industry grew, and the second half of the century saw numerous innovations.\nThe two most significant innovations of the 19th century were mechanical pressing and a new formula for high quality glass. Mechanical pressing increased productivity and allowed more of the public to afford glassware. It was developed simultaneously at several locations during the 1820s. Among those that received pressing-related patents were John P. Bakewell of Bakewell and Company; Henry Whitney and Enoch Robinson of New England Glass Company; and Phineas C. Dummer, George Dummer, and James Maxwell of the Jersey City Glass Works. A new formula for glass, developed by William Leighton Sr. at J. H. Hobbs, Brockunier and Company, lowered costs and allowed even more people to afford glassware.\nMany mechanical innovations in the last half of the century involved the procedure for melting ingredients, cooling (annealing) newly made glass, and automation. By the end of the century a new machine designed by John H. Lubbers began to make many glassblowers obsolete, and work was being conducted on a bottle-making machine by Michael J. Owens that eventually revolutionized the bottle industry. Preliminary work by Irving Wightman Colburn had started that would change the way window glass was made. Owens and Colburn worked together to finish this new window glass process during the 20th century. A new formula for ruby glass, which did not need gold as an additive, was developed by Nicholas Kopp Jr. in the 1890s around the time of the start of the American auto industry.\n\n\n== Two fathers ==\n\nGlass is made by starting with a batch of ingredients, melting it, forming the glass product, and gradually cooling it. In 1800, the United States is thought to have had no more than a ten operating glass factories. Most of the nation's glass products came from Europe. Lead ore, known as red lead, was a key ingredient necessary to make high-quality glassware, but England controlled the world's known supply. The United States Embargo Act of 1807, and the War of 1812, made red lead extremely difficult to acquire. After the war England kept the price of red lead high, and dumped low-priced glass products in the United States. This drove some American glass companies into bankruptcy.\nOne of the few successful American glass companies was the New England Glass Company, which was incorporated in 1818 and led by Deming Jarves—who has been called the \"father of the American glass industry.\" Using assistance from the Harvard University library and a British engineer named James B. Barnes, Jarves developed a way to produce red lead from domestic sources of lead oxide. Jarves' red lead was good enough that his New England Glass Company was exporting cut crystal glassware to Europe by 1825. Jarves smuggled European glassmaking talent to America at a time when it was forbidden by European countries. However, the glassmakers themselves kept their techniques and recipes secret. If a company lost a skilled glassworker, it was possible that certain types of glass could no longer be made at the glassworks. Jarves began to keep records of glass recipes and procedures. This gave him more control over the intellectual rights of his company. New England Glass Company was a \"great innovator under the leadership of Deming Jarves\" and Jarves \"revolutionized the American glass industry\".\nBenjamin Bakewell founded a glass manufacturing company in Pittsburgh in 1808. This company, which began as Bakewell & Ensell, became Pittsburgh's best known glass manufacturer. It changed its name many times, but always had Bakewell as part of the name. Among the names used were Bakewell, Page & Bakewell; and Bakewell, Pears & Company. The Bakewell and Pears families were involved with the company for most of its existence, and Benjamin Page was an important member of the company in its early years. Bakewell needed skilled glassworkers early in the company's existence, so English glass men were smuggled to Pittsburgh. The company received its supply of red lead from Deming Jarves. Bakewell became well known for its lead crystal glass, and also made engraved and cut glassware. Other products, such as window glass and bottles, were also made. Jarves considered Benjamin Bakewell the \"father of the flint-glass [crystal] business in this country\". In the 1820s and 1830s, Bakewell glassware was purchased for the White House by presidents James Monroe and Andrew Jackson.\n\n\n== 19th century innovations ==\nThe mechanical innovations, and other innovations, listed below are from an essay published in the December 1920 edition of Scientific American. The essay was titled Modern Glass-Making, and it was written by E. Ward Tillotson, assistant director of the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research. The essay contains a list titled Some Notable Developments in the Glass Industry. Some of these innovations were first developed in the United States, while others were already in operation in foreign countries. During the 19th century and earlier, European countries (and their skilled glassworkers) tried to keep glassmaking methods secret—causing some processes to need to be rediscovered in the United States. The leading manufacturers (and exporters) of European glass, based on statistics from near 1880, were England, France, Belgium, Germany, and Austria–Hungry. William Leighton Jr., chemist at J. H. Hobbs, Brockunier and Company, wrote a newspaper article in 1880 that called pressing and the new soda-lime glass formula the two great steps in American glassmaking. Professor Warren C. Scoville of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in an essay titled Growth of the American Glass Industry to 1880, considered the five outstanding glassmaking innovations up to that time to be 1) mechanical pressing; 2) the new soda-lime (a.k.a. lime) glass formula; 3) the shift from wood to coal for fuel; 4) the beginning of plate glass manufacturing; and 5) the gas furnace.\n\n\n=== Mechanical Innovations ===\n\nPressed glass: The most important innovation for the 1820s was the development of machine pressed glass—pressing glass into a mold. Although pressing glass by hand had long existed, mechanical pressing of glass did not exist until the 1820s—and it was an American invention. John P. Bakewell of Bakewell, Page & Bakewell patented a pressing method for making glass furniture knobs in 1825. Henry Whitney and Enoch Robinson of New England Glass Company received a pressing–related patent in 1826; and Phineas C. Dummer, George Dummer, and James Maxwell of the Jersey City Glass Works received pressing and mold–related patents in 1828. The use of a machine to press glass enabled two workers to produce four times as much glassware as a team of three or four glassblowers. Mechanical pressing of glass reduced the time and labor necessary to make glass products, which lowered costs and made glass products available to more of the public. An 1884 U.S. government report considered mechanical pressing and a new formula for glass to be the two great advances in American glassmaking during the 19th century. One author called mechanical pressing \"the greatest contribution of America to glassmaking, and the most important development since the Romans discovered glassblowing....\"\nRegenerative pot furnace: In 1865 Pittsburgh's O'Hara Glass Works of James B. Lyons and Company installed the first regenerative pot furnace for use with producer gas. These furnaces save on fuel expense by using waste heat to separately heat the air and gas prior to burning. A more intense heat is produced, which reduces the time for melting the batch. First used in Europe, makers of these types of furnaces were Siemens, Nicholson, and Gill. The O'Hara Glass Works in Pittsburgh was the first to use a Siemens regenerative pot furnace, but experienced difficulty utilizing the new technology.\nContinuous tank: In March 1880 the first successful continuous tank used for the production of glass in the United States began operations. The success was realized by the Anglo–American Glass Company, which was organized in July 1879 in Poughkeepsie, New York. The company was reorganized as a corporation in November 1880 as the Poughkeepsie Glass Works. The plant's major product was bottles. Raw materials for the glass were continuously fed into the furnace, and the melting was continuous. The glass made using this methodology could be only one color.\nNatural gas for melting glass: Natural gas began being used in the United States to melt glass batch during the early 1880s. The Bradford Window Glass Company of Bradford, Pennsylvania, was the first user—beginning in 1883. The first try using this fuel was not successful, and it was not until 1885 the furnace was configured to use natural gas effectively. In 1884 the Riverside Glass Works of Wellsburg, West Virginia, was the first flint glass manufacturer to achieve success with natural gas. This led to a gas boom in Northwest Ohio and another gas boom in East Central Indiana, where glass manufacturers were attracted by the discovery low–cost natural gas in those regions. Waste and mismanagement caused the natural gas to be depleted in less than 20 years.\nPrepressed blank: In 1882 Philip Arbogast received a patent for \"Manufacture of Glassware\" that involved using a machine to press the neck of a bottle. This was an important step in automating the production of glass bottles. Arbogast sold his patent and did not build the machine specified in his patent, but others used his idea.\nWindow glass: Two advances were made in window glassmaking during the 1880s. In 1882 Cleon Tondeur received a patent for what he called a \"Glass–Annealing Furnace\". This was the first continuous lehr (also spelled \"leer\") for window glass. The sheets of glass were \"received by the furnace\" (the start of the lehr), and \"discharged by their exit ends\" (the finished end of the lehr) \"out of the tunnel without opening the furnace or tunnel....\" A 1915 report noted that continuous lehrs had replaced intermittent kilns \"to a large extent\", and the \"Tondeur rod lehr is the type which is commonly used today [1915]\". The second innovation for window glassmaking in the 1880s was the use of a continuous tank for window glass. This was introduced in 1884 by the United Glass Works in Streator, Illinois, according to Tillotson. Another source cites the Chambers and McKee Window Glass Company of Jeanette, Pennsylvania, as the first user of a continuous melting tank furnace in the United States. The start year for this factory's innovation was 1889, and the continuous tank helped mechanize window glass production.\nFlint glass melted in tank: In 1898 Charles H. Runyon of the Keystone Glass Company in Rochester, Pennsylvania, was the first in the United States to melt the batch for flint glass in a tank. A second source calls the Rochester company operating at that time (1897–1905) by the name of Keystone Tumbler Company.\nContinuous lehr for plate glass: The Marsh Plate Glass Works of Walton, Pennsylvania, has been listed as the innovator for a continuous lehr for plate glass. George A. Marsh of the Marsh Plate Glass Company applied for multiple glass–related patents during 1898 that were granted in 1899: \"Table for Holding Plate–glass\", \"Apparatus for Grinding, Smoothing, and Polishing Glass\", \"Apparatus for Holding Glass\", and \"Glass–holding Table\". The Marsh Plate Glass Company built a plant to use the new technology, which was purchased by Pittsburg Plate Glass Company before 1901. In addition to the two just–mentioned companies, the Edward Ford Plate Glass Company became involved with continuous lehrs for plate glass in 1900. In 1909 W. L. Clause, president of Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company, testified before Congress that \"...it is a matter of common knowledge that the Marsh Plate Glass Works were a failure and that the works have never operated successfully. The lehr referred to was a prophecy rather than a realization.\" He also added his company's development of a successful lehr took years of time.\nFire polishing cut glass blanks: In 1899 Michael J. Owens introduced a machine for fire polishing glass. Owens and Amos R. Wilson applied for a patent on a \"Machine for Fire–Finishing Glass Articles\" on June 24, 1899, and received the patent on September 10, 1901.\nAutomatic bottle machine: In 1895 Edward Libbey formed the Toledo Glass Company, where Michael Owens would work on creating an automatic bottle machine. His first success occurred in 1899 when he developed a machine that could produce a four-ounce (29.57 ml) petroleum jelly jar. Producing the long neck of a bottle required more research. His first commercial bottle making machine was produced from 1904 to 1908. Although the machine replaced glassblowers, it created more jobs because it increased demand for bottles. The uniformity in bottle size led to new types of bottles: beer bottles, milk bottles, and baby bottles.\nMachine drawn window glass: John H. Lubbers created a glass blowing machine. Experiments began in 1896. The machine withdrew the molten glass and blew a cylinder as the first step in Cylinder method for making window glass—replacing the task of highly skilled and highly-paid glassblowers. An application for a patent on the Lubbers machine was filed during 1900, and a patent for \"Apparatus for Drawing Glass\" was issued in 1902. American Window Glass Company, a trust with many factories, used the machine at various locations while Lubbers continued to improve his invention over the next decade. A decade later, human glassblowers that made approximately $2,000 (equivalent to $61,657 in 2023) for nine months of work were replaced by machine operators that made about $600 (equivalent to $18,497 in 2023) over the same time. Glass produced by machine could total 50 boxes over an eight-hour shift, while human glassblowers could produce only 60 boxes in six days.\n\n\n=== Other Innovations ===\n\nPlate glass: In his list of notable developments in the glass industry, Tillotson lists an unnamed glass works in Williamsburg, New York (a neighborhood in Brooklyn), as the site of the first plate glass factory in America—with a date of 1857. The works was put out of business by competition from Belgium and France. In August 1857 the U.S. Manufacturing and Polishing Plate Glass Company was formed in New York for the purpose of plate glass manufacturing. It had not opened a glass works, although it had been conducting experiments. In 1882 Captain John B. Ford, after several failures, started the first commercially successful plate glass company in the United States. Production began in 1884, and the company name was changed to Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company after an investor bought a significant number of shares of company stock.\nLime–flint glass: In 1864 William Leighton Sr., a former employee of New England Glass company now working for J. H. Hobbs, Brockunier and Company, conducted experiments making high quality glass without lead. In December he used  a formula consisting of bicarbonate of soda instead of soda ash. His formula was similar to the long-lost soda-lime formula used many years earlier in Europe. The glass made using this formula had good enough quality that the company could compete in the high-end of the glassware market. The ingredients used to make the glass were lower-cost than those used to make lead glass. In addition, the glass hardened faster, meaning the workforce was forced to shape or press it quicker—lowering costs for labor in addition to lower costs for ingredients. This new formula for glass quickly replaced the recipe consisting of lead at most American factories specializing in glassware.\nWire glass: Frank Shuman developed a process for embedding wire in glass, which functioned as reinforcement and made the glass safer. This type of glass, safety glass, was used in overhead lighting and where it was wise to protect people from the possible impacts of shattering glass. Shuman received two patents in 1892, and they were the only United States patents for embedding wire netting in glass at the time.\nFavrile glass: Louis Comfort Tiffany developed Favrile glass around 1892. It has an iridescent surface created by spraying hot glass with metallic salts that were absorbed into the glass. Tiffany trademarked the name \"Favrile\" in 1894, and it is derived from the word \"fabrile\"—which is the old English word for hand–wrought. Favrile glass is displayed in museums such as the Corning Museum of Glass, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Rhode Island School of Design Museum.\nSelenium ruby glass: During 1894, Nicholas Kopp discovered a formula for making ruby (deep red) glass using selenium instead of gold. The new formula replaced the older gold–based formula, and it came as the growing automobile industry increased demand for ruby glass. The older formula, which was based on gold as an essential ingredient, had been lost (to Americans) until Thomas Leighton of New England Glass re–discovered it in 1848. Ruby glass, also known as cranberry glass, was originally developed in Prussia during the 1600s.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== References ===",

        "content": "John Legate (died 1620?) was an English printer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLegate was admitted and sworn a freeman of the Stationers' Company on 11 April 1586 (Arber, ii. 696). He was appointed printer to the university of Cambridge by grace, on 2 Nov. 1588, as ‘he is reported to be skilful in the art of printing books.’ On 26 April 1589 he received as an apprentice Cantrell Legge, afterwards also university printer and his immediate successor in the conduct of the press at Cambridge. From 1590 to 1609 he appeared in the parish books of St. Mary the Great, Cambridge, as paying 5s. a year for the rent of a shop. In 1609 he was elected churchwarden, and paid a fine of 10s. for his ‘dismission.’ The respective rights of the Company of Stationers and of the university were at this time not well defined, and there were frequent differences between them. By the help of their chancellor the rights of the university and of their printer were successfully defended, and in 1597 an entry in the ‘Stationers' Registers’ (ib. iii. 88) shows that the stationers acknowledged Legate's right to copyright protection for a book printed by the authority of the vice-chancellor, ‘so that none of this company shall prynt yt from hym.’ Legate had the exclusive right to print the Latin dictionary of Thomas Thomas, his predecessor as university printer, a right renewed to his children after his death, and he also printed most of the books of William Perkins.\nLegate left Cambridge about 1609. In 1612 he was described on the title page of one of his books as living at Trinity Lane (between Old Fish Street and Bow Lane), London. On 21 August 1620 an entry appears in the ‘Stationers' Registers’ (ib. iv. 45) of forty-two books transferred to John Legate the younger, ‘the copies of John Legate, his father, lately deceased,’ and of these no less than twenty-six are by Perkins. This entry is the only evidence we have of the year of his death. On 4 February 1588–9 he married, at St. Mary the Great, Cambridge, Alice Sheirs, and between 17 January 1589–90 and 9 July 1609 the baptism of nine daughters and three sons, and the death of one infant daughter, appear in the registers of that parish. He is said by Ames (Typ. Ant. p. 462) to have married Agatha, daughter of Christopher Barker, queen's printer; and according to Nichols (Lit. Illustr. iv. 164) Agatha, daughter of Robert Barker. If these statements apply to the elder Legate, he must have married a second wife after he left Cambridge.\nJohn Legate the younger (1600–1658), his eldest son, was baptised in the parish of St. Mary the Great, Cambridge, on 8 June 1600, was admitted freeman of the Stationers' Company on 6 Sept. 1619, and on the death of his father in the following year succeeded to his business. He was included in the list of authorised London printers in the Star-chamber decrees in 1637, and again in 1648. He was appointed one of the Cambridge University printers by grace on 5 July 1650, probably in succession to Roger Daniel, but his patent was cancelled for neglect on 10 October 1655. He died, ‘distempered in his senses,’ at Little Wood Street, London, 4 Nov. 1658 (R. Smyth, Obituary, Camd. Soc.). In the parish registers of St. Botolph at Cambridge, 25 June 1642, is a marriage of John Legate to Elizabeth Grime. This in all probability concerns the younger Legate.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Bowes, Robert (1892). \"Legate, John\".

The walking, biking and bus tours help raise awareness of the historical and enduring presence of Indigenous peoples in the Great Toronto Area (GTA).\nFirst Story Toronto Tours initially started in 1994 as the \"Great Indian Bus Tour.\" It was led by Indigenous activists Rodney Bobiwash and Heather Howard as part of the Native Community History Project at the Native Canadian Centre of Toronto. The \"Great Indian Bus Tour\" included information on Indigenous histories from archaeological research, archival records, and oral history recording by Toronto's First Nations elders and community members. It was a three to five-hour bus tour that highlighted Indigenous place-names across the city as a way to raise awareness of Indigenous histories.\nFollowing Rodney Bobiwash’ passing in 2002, First Story Toronto members expanded the original “Great Indian Bus Tour” to include additional stories and circuits. This includes walking tours of the three University of Toronto campuses, as well as Toronto Metropolitan University and York University. In 2012, the tours were adapted into the First Story Toronto mobile app that puts Indigenous histories and research on an interactive online map. In 2017, First Story Toronto led a Truth and Reconciliation on the Streets of Toronto tour.\n\n\n== References ==",

After managing to get a candidate for state deputy elected in Ceará, the party ceased its activities in 1991 and was refounded in December as the Brazilian Workers' Nationalist Party. The party contested the 1992 municipal elections and merged in 1993 with the Labour Party of Brazil (PTdoB).\nAffiliated with the PTdoB, João de Deus ran for president in the 1998 presidential election. In his electoral campaign, he proposed to fight unemployment; to transfer the Amazon River to Northeast Brazil, a region affected by droughts; to create an exit for Brazil to the Pacific Ocean; and to implement projects from Getúlio Vargas' government, which included investments in public healthcare, the opening of state-funded restaurants for the poor and the increase in the minimum wage. His candidacy was challenged in the Superior Electoral Court by the national leadership of his party, which had predetermined not to launch its own candidate. João de Deus received 0.29% of the votes, coming 8th of 12 candidates.\nIn 2000, he ran for councillor in the city of Rio de Janeiro, but was not elected.\n\n\n== References ==",

A smaller autograph copy without the accompanying figure on the right is now in the Galleria Sabauda in Turin.\nIn 1622 tailor and art collector left it and the rest of his collection to the Girolamini, Naples, where it still hangs. It is next mentioned in 1692 by Carlo Celano as being in the church's sacristy - he also gave it its erroneous title of Ecce Homo.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Revolt of the Fishermen (Russian Восстание рыбаков, Wosstanije rybakow) is a feature film and early sound film based on the novel Revolt of the Fishermen of Santa Barbara by Anna Seghers, which was made between 1931 and 1934 on behalf of the German-Russian Mezhrabpomfilm company in the Soviet Union. The original intention was to produce a German and a Russian version directed against the growing Nazi movement. Due to considerable organizational deficits and differences between the film company and the director, only the Russian version could be completed. This was the feature film debut of German director Erwin Piscator.\nThe film deals with a strike among the workers of the Bredel shipping company. The strike is triggered by an accident during fish processing, which the workers attribute to the excessive pace of work on the shipping company's fishing fleet. After the death of a strike leader, the strike escalates and spreads from the deep-sea fishermen to the independent coastal fishermen in the region. The film was shot in the Ukraine, the Russian peninsula of Kola and Moscow.\nIn its editing effects, long tracking shots and lighting direction, the Revolt of the Fishermen is stylistically similar to the works of Soviet film directors Sergei Eisenstein and Vsevolod Pudovkin from the transition period from silent to sound film. However, due to the technique of the moving camera and its independent sound direction, the feature film also contrasts with the Russian film tradition.\nThe Revolt of the Fishermen premiered in the Soviet Union in October 1934. An export version with subtitles was distributed in other European countries the following year. The film was presented for the first time in West Germany during the 6th West German Short Film Festival in March 1960. It has since been presented in film societies, arthouse cinemas and film festivals such as the Berlinale 2012, but the \"precarious condition of copies slowed down a wider reception\".\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe Revolt of the Fishermen deals with a strike among the impoverished deep-sea fishermen and sailors of the coastal town of Port Sebastian (also: San Sebastian), which is triggered by deteriorating working conditions on the ships of the shipowner Bredel. The fishermen on one of Bredel's ships bring in the catch. A shark has come on board as by-catch and tries to eat a small fish while it is still dying. The sailors gutting the fish are repeatedly told to work faster. The pace of work on the ships in Bredel's fishing fleet has increased considerably, as the shipowner now only employs three men per shift instead of four. When a worker cuts off his thumb with a shark knife, the fishermen spontaneously stop working in protest.\nIn view of the accident, the deep-sea fishermen call on the captain to reduce the work intensity. Four men per shift are to be employed again. When the captain rejects this demand, the deep-sea fishermen decide to go on strike. The fishing fleet had to return to the port of the main town of Port Sebastian. At the shipping company office in Port Sebastian, the sailors are deprived of their wages. The garrison commander and the shipowner Bredel witness the orderly departure of the striking sailors. The commander deploys soldiers.\nStrike leader Hull calls for a joint strike between the deep-sea fishermen from Port Sebastian and the coastal fishermen from the surrounding area, whose economic situation is slightly better than that of the deep-sea fishermen. However, joint industrial action does not materialize as the shipowner Bredel offers the small-scale fishermen in the area the prospect of one hundred percent more pay for their catch. The small-scale fishermen then set sail for Bredel, but lose half of their catch in stormy seas. The deep-sea fishermen, on the other hand, win their case against the shipping company and initially resume work. Bredel breaks his promise to pay the coastal fishermen a wage supplement. When the coastal fishermen realize that Bredel does not intend to keep his promise, they finally join forces with the deep-sea fishermen from Port Sebastian. In Desak's inn in the small coastal town of St. Barbara, the deep-sea and coastal fishermen discuss a joint labor dispute. However, the meeting is blown up by an act of arson.\nA group led by the moderate fisherman Kerdhuys decides against going on strike and wants to go fishing for Bredel the day after the unsuccessful meeting in St. Barbara. In the morning, Martin Kedennek, an individualist from St. Barbara, and his people, who want to go on strike against the shipping company, ambush Kerdhuys and his comrades-in-arms. Kedennek tries to stop Kerdhuys from breaking the strike with a knife. When Kedennek attacks Kerdhuys, he is struck down by a bullet from one of the soldiers mobilized by the garrison commander. The next morning, there is another direct confrontation in the dunes between strikers and a group of coastal fishermen led by the well-off boat owner Bruyk, who - like Kerdhuys the day before - want to set sail for Bredel. Andreas, a young fisherman who lives with the Kedennek family, also joins the strikebreakers for the sake of appearances. Secretly, however, Andreas is planning an explosive attack on Bruyk's fishing boat.\nThe mood in the coastal fishing communities is tense. The mourning fishermen from the entire coastal region flock to Martin Kedenek's funeral. The shipowner Bredel arranges for more soldiers to be sent to St. Barbara as he fears an escalation of the conflict. Bredel asked the clergyman to hold back the mourners at the grave. The situation at the gravesite threatens to get out of hand. The fishermen's displeasure at a sermon by the priest, who strongly condemns Kedennek's actions, erupts in a cry from the widow, Marie Kedennek. Marie Kedennek knocks the Bible out of the clergyman's hand and tears it up. Meanwhile, the soldiers in St. Barbara are looking for the revolutionary sailor Hull from Port Sebastian, whom Bredel has identified as the real ringleader of the strike movement. The soldiers trash Desak's pub and rape Marie, a prostitute who works for Desak as a temporary help and who is having an affair with Andreas. The funeral is interrupted by explosions on Bruyk's ship, which Andreas has caused. The explosions are the signal for a revolt by the coastal fishermen against the shipowner and the summoned military, who approach the cemetery in firing lines.\nFierce fighting breaks out between the insurgent fishermen and their wives and the military, during which the saboteur Andreas is shot dead as he flees. After conquering strategically important military positions, the numerically superior insurgents led by strike leader Hull win the unequal battle. In the turmoil of the uprising, Bredel manages to escape.\n\n\n== Relationship to the original literary work ==\nThe feature film is based on the novel Revolt of the Fishermen of St. Barbara by Anna Seghers, for which the author was awarded the Kleist Prize in 1928. Piscator made significant changes to the story. He turned the pessimistic ending of the original, in which the fishermen's misery is described in detail, into a militant appeal for the popular front against Nazi Germany. The director pointed out that he had initially moved the plot of the film \"from northern Spain to northern Germany\", thus enabling the main characters \"to come into contact with those who had a similar social position at the time[.] It corresponded to the small fisherman, the small farmer.\" Piscator's geographical considerations initially relate to the unfinished German version of the film. Film scholar Günther Agde also interprets the completed Russian film version from 1934 as a \" virtually placeless, but clearly non-Russian film.\" Piscator originally wanted to reach a German film audience and the unionized and politically unorganized classes in Germany, who seemed to him to be particularly susceptible to National Socialism. Anna Seghers had already shown that these classes were \"dependent to the point of being drained\". He, on the other hand, wanted to illustrate how it was possible to remain independent by organizing oneself into a trade union.\nAccording to theater scholar Peter Diezel, Piscator's film adaptation was in line with the strategic guideline of Thälmann's KPD leadership of the \"anti-fascist united front and the inclusion of the petit-bourgeois classes\". However, this manifested itself as a \"rather brutal approach\" towards Anna Seghers, as it meant nothing less than a \"deconstruction of her narrative text\". To this end, as he later summarized, Piscator had introduced a seamen's union in his film adaptation, who worked on the \"trawlers sent out by large fisheries and had started a strike over the removal of the fourth man in a work group.\" Meanwhile, the small-scale fishermen continued to work and had thus essentially become strikebreakers; a series of won and lost strikes followed. According to Piscator, however, \"since the organized helped the unorganized, even when it was no longer about their own cause, these strikes turned from purely economic to political actions and - at least I hoped so - into a call against a system like the one the Nazis intended.\"\n\nSeghers expert Helen Fehervary also concludes that Piscator deconstructs an essential element of his literary model: the subject of Seghers' model is the \"failed strike of the fishermen against the shipping company that controls their wages and their entire lives. In the end, the boats leave under the same conditions that gave rise to the uprising. The everyday life of class relations is thus restored.\" This element of failure in Seghers' original bears witness to the revolutionary history in Central Europe after the First World War. At the beginning of Seghers' story, the failure of the insurgents is visualized with an allegorization of the uprising: Long after the uprising of the fishermen, the insurrection had \"still sat on the empty, white summer-bare marketplace\" and \"calmly thought of its own, whom it had born, raised, cared for and sheltered for what was best for them\",. This allegorical moment is missing in Piscator's film, as it is aimed at a successful uprising.\nWhile the geographical setting of Seghers' story is indeterminable, Piscator imagined \"a story explicitly set on the German North Sea coast\", which evokes the naval and Spartacus uprisings of 1918 and 1919: \"In Kedenek's martyrdom, there are echoes of Karl Liebknecht's assassination in January 1919; the funeral procession and burial scenes echo the resonance of the mourning masses that accompanied Liebknecht's coffin through the streets of Berlin. \" According to Fehervary, Grebner's script largely adhered to Seghers' original in terms of the plot and characterization of the figures. However, the decisive difference between the story and the film lies at the end, namely the revolt of armed sailors, which does not occur in Seghers. While Seghers retrospectively depicts a failed uprising, in Piscator's film armed sailors come to the aid of the poorly prepared and organized fishermen. After the final battle, the film ends \"with a victory song, beaming faces and a happy ending for everyone except the Bredel shipping company and its hired soldiers.\" Here, behind the camera, one senses the film director's \"deeply felt, one might almost say desperate, call for activism in times of crisis.\"\nCultural scientist Simone Schofer distinguishes the psychological characterization style of the original book from the \"politicized\" portrayal of characters in the film. Seghers places more emphasis on individuals and extensively depicts individual reactions and feelings in order to make the development of the uprising comprehensible to the reader. The feature film, on the other hand, aims to describe the uprising itself, so that individual actions are not always fully revealed to the viewer. However, in the film, the female characters, who in Seghers' work were mainly absorbed in stereotypical roles in the household and at the hearth, are more strongly exposed and actively involved in the economic and political struggle. While Seghers' narrative is characterized by an emphatically unsentimental, sober form of representation, Piscator is primarily concerned with awakening the revolutionary consciousness of a working-class community in the masses and calling for a united struggle.This can be clearly seen in the \"somewhat unrealistic victory of the fishermen over the soldiers\" at the end of the film, after an unequal battle with bare hands and sticks against machine guns. Although Seghers' original was \"attuned to the inevitable tragedy of defeat\" from the outset, her work is nevertheless not at odds with Piscator's intentions. Also in her case, the men did not give up hope for the uprising and by the following year the uprising was still \"squatting in the town squares\".\n\n\n== Film analysis ==\nSoon after Piscator's death, the State Film Archive of the GDR published an undated information sheet on the Revolt of the Fishermen in its \"Film Sheets\" series, according to which Piscator, a man of the theater, had mastered the wide range of cinematic expression in his only film. The constant alternation between close-ups, long shots and long tracking shots, the atmospheric lighting direction and the symbolic visual language are emphasized as striking film-aesthetic design elements: \"The close-up and detail shots repeatedly bring order to the crowd scenes and constantly force the viewer to make a personal statement. It is both symbolic and at the same time of expressive atmospheric power.\" The author of the information sheet refers, for example, to the opening symbol of the dying shark devouring a fish with its last convulsions, to a knife flashing in the sand as the workers' fronts face each other, and to the soldiers' boots that freeze Marie shortly before the rape sequence.\nIncidentally, the film's highlights are due to a montage technique based on Eisenstein's silent films, through which the dramaturgical contrasts are heightened to \"incredible speed\". In addition to the camera work, the crowd scenes and the cross-cutting, the still young sound direction is also cited: \"The sound becomes particularly effective in the functional incorporation of songs and battle songs, which are heard again and again at the climax of the action.\" The choir of deep-sea fishermen forms a counterpoint to the action surrounding the small-scale fishermen as a static, reflective element.\nThe German scholar Klaus Gleber describes the preferred use of \"editing effects and montage\" as characteristic of Piscator's film: \"The latter is used both contrastively (while the priest invokes the divine right of power, the soldiers rage) and symbolically reinforcing (surf as an illustration of the uprising). Close-ups and long tracking shots are just as much a part of the inventory as the image, which is geared towards the viewer's power of association.\" The communication scientist Hermann Haarmann also emphasizes the rapid camera movements and tracking shots - unusual for the time -, oblique camera work and rapid editing sequences. However, Piscator's film always maintained a \"balance between aesthetic innovation and outdated schematization\", especially with regard to the rather conventional character acting including physiognomy, posture and clothing on the one hand and an avant-garde formal language borrowed from epic theater on the other. The avant-garde formal language includes the brief introduction of the protagonists through their faces at the beginning of the film, the spoken and superimposed commentaries - the intertitles are reminiscences of silent films - as well as the choral element of the music. The fact that a chorus intervenes in the action after each \"film chapter\" is due to Bertolt Brecht's Lehrstück-Theater, from which Piscator borrows.\nJasmin Arnold recognizes a film aesthetic innovation in the fact that Piscator interspersed the \"sounds of the ships with words, chants and choirs.\" With regard to the montage principles, she points out that Piscator did not use them everywhere, but only where they seemed appropriate. He left long discussions uncut and approached the speakers. For cultural scientist Bianca Schemel, the cinematic use of the chorus, which is often \"too static and wooden\", shows Piscator's origins in theater directing. Schemel also refers to the special effect of rear projection that Piscator uses in the assassin Andreas' escape from the military: \"Andreas' escape and his pursuit by the soldiers are filmed with a special effect, the rear projection. In this, part of the scene is filmed first and the actor is then shot again in front of the film that has already been shot.\"\nHermann Haarmann also points to the film's \"meaningful lighting direction\", which is handled with virtuosity in connection with nature motifs and landscape images, among other things: \"Pipe and cigarette smoke rises everywhere and at all times, enveloping heads or silhouettes in backlighting - silhouettes also confirm the use of strongly symbolizing light.\"  At the same time, the intense \"emphasis on the elements (sea with ebb and flow, rising and subsiding storm, moonlit night and bright day)\" intensifies the \"impressive play of light. These motifs from nature converge in the demonstrative intensification of the social conflict as a quasi-naturally developing conflict between the strikers, the strikebreakers and the soldiers bought by the state, the church and the bourgeoisie to do the dirty work.\"\n\n\n== Topics ==\nOn the occasion of the film's re-screening at the Berlinale 2012, film scholar Günter Agde emphasizes the close look at the \"work in the details of its execution\", which the Revolt of the Fishermen shares with other productions by Mezhrabpomfilm. For example, the \"furious beginning\" of the film shows \"a wealth of details of fishing at sea, salvaging and landing in the harbor.\" At the same time, however, this presentation of different forms of work revealed \"an almost naïve trust on the part of the filmmakers in the physical strength of the workers, which pointed beyond the films.\" Apart from the technological side of the topic of \"work\", these film sequences would have given the cinema audience of the time interesting insights into the everyday life of Soviet working environments. In this respect, these images had their own documentary value beyond the film itself. The treatment of the topic of work quickly shifts from the initial focus on concrete work processes to aspects such as the intensification of work, organized labour disputes and their violent suppression.\nThe film is characterized by the desire to counter the growing Nazi movement at the end of the Weimar Republic with an anti-fascist united front, in line with the KPD policy of the time, for which the petty bourgeois classes were to be won over. Based on the labour dispute between the deep-sea fishermen and the petty-bourgeois coastal fishermen, who, unlike the deep-sea fishermen, owned their means of production, with the shipping company, Piscator wanted to demonstrate the necessity of a joint, organized struggle. In 1975, a West German study on Piscator's work in Soviet emigration had already pointed out that the petty bourgeoisie, constantly threatened with proletarianization by big capital and increasingly so during the crisis, was becoming a potential accomplice of fascism, which promised a solution to the crisis but concealed its means of solving it. Here, \"the avant-garde of the proletariat had to create clarity and point out the revolutionary alternative.\" The necessity and success of such a policy were the subject of Piscator's film.\nExile research in the GDR in the 1970s also picked up on this thematic focus of the film. The united front theme becomes particularly clear at the end of the film, where a chanting choir formulates a call to all exploited people to join the united front. But even the beginning of the film reflects this concept. Since, according to GDR exile researcher Renate Waack-Ullrich, the film aims to enlighten the middle classes, who are afflicted by petty-bourgeois ideology, about their own social situation, Piscator begins it \"not with the story of the [coastal] fishermen, but with the increasingly intensifying main contradiction between capitalists and the working class: Bredel's fishing vessel.\"\nAccording to Renate Waack-Ullrich, the fishermen, as representatives of the petty bourgeoisie, are only \"introduced into the action when the main contradiction between the capitalists and the working class is exposed. The outcome of the strike depends on whether the fishermen side with the capitalists or the sailors - this is shown primarily visually.\" Their actions are then depicted in the following decisive stages: how they allow themselves to be misled into breaking the strike by Bredel's false promises, how most of them do not want to understand that they have long been proletarianized despite their material plight, and how only several deaths in their own ranks bring them to desperate joint action. At the end of the film, even the moderate fisherman and unsuccessful strikebreaker Kerdhuys finally realizes that only a joint industrial action can lead to success.\nAccording to communication scientist Hermann Haarmann, Piscator positioned his film project \"exactly where there is a need for argumentation: in the agitation of the middle classes, who are objectively threatened with proletarianization, but at the same time believe every promise of social advancement.\" The seductiveness of ideology and propaganda does the rest. Since the middle classes were the basis for the success of fascism, Piscator placed particular emphasis on small-scale fishermen in line with the classical theory of fascism, which \"holds the social status between the classes, between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, responsible for the National Socialist conflagration\". However, Haarmann interprets the underlying political intention of the film project as deceptive. Given a divided workers' movement, whose factions had accused each other of breaking their word and left the field to fascism at the end of the Weimar Republic, the desire of intellectual KPD sympathizers, who at the beginning of the 1930s \"still hoped for a turnaround and wanted to work towards it\", was illusory.\n\n\n== Adverse production circumstances ==\n\nIn the summer of 1930, Piscator had initially planned to film Theodor Plievier's successful debut novel Des Kaisers Kulis, which dealt with the precarious working conditions on the ships of the imperial navy. According to the German scholar Klaus Gleber, however, the realization of an elaborate film with revolutionary content in Germany would have faced \"considerable difficulties, especially as the 'Münzenberg Group' did not have the necessary means of production.\" The left-wing media entrepreneur Willi Münzenberg therefore put Piscator in touch with the Soviet joint-stock company Mezhrabpomfilm. During negotiations in Moscow, Piscator reached an agreement with Mezhrabpomfilm in September 1930 on a film version of the Plievier novel. In April 1931, he traveled to Moscow with an initial synopsis for the screenplay. Piscator had asked to use ships from the Soviet Black Sea Fleet for the filming. He wanted to use these ships to recreate the 1916 Battle of Jutland, which is the subject of Plievier's novel. It was only weeks after his arrival in Moscow that Mezhrabpomfilm informed him that his application to use the Black Sea Fleet had been rejected. The Soviet Foreign Minister, People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Maxim Litvinov, feared diplomatic entanglements with the German Reich in this case and refused.\nAnna Seghers' novel Revolt of the fishermen of St. Barbara was quickly selected as a substitute. Peter Diezel assumes that the intensive study of the 1918 sailors' mutiny and thematic analogies between Plievier's and Seghers' works contributed to Piscator's decision to choose Anna Seghers' story as a suitable replacement.\n\nAs subsequent dubbing was not yet possible at the time for technical reasons, both a German and a Russian version of the film were to be shot. The screenplay for the planned German version of the Revolt of the Fishermen was to be written by the Austrian-British writer Anna Wiesner, who had also worked on Piscator's screenplay for Des Kaisers Kulis. The Russian version of the screenplay was written by the scenarist Georgi Grebner. Although Piscator had virtually no experience in the film industry, Meschrabpom-Film had set aside just five or at most six months to work on the script and shoot the film, which meant that considerable problems were inevitable.\nIn July 1931, Piscator began filming the first shots of nature in the port city of Murmansk on the Arctic Ocean. The Arctic film motifs and the long summer twilight phases made a lasting impression on him: \"These magnificent white nights there in the north, which last for three months, or the nets frozen in the ice.\" Later that month, during a stay in Berlin, he hired fourteen German and Austrian actors for the film project, including Lotte Lenya as the prostitute Marie and Paul Wegener as the shipowner Bredel. At the beginning of August 1931, indoor filming was to begin in the Meshrabpom studio in Moscow, but a fire broke out. A fire destroyed two of a total of three studios, including the decorations that had been set up in them, and required weeks of renovation work.\n\nPiscator decided without much hesitation to prepare the exterior shots on the Ukrainian Black Sea coast near Odesa instead, but material shortages and transportation difficulties for the decoration led to delays. The director spent a considerable amount of his time waiting \"for the provision of financial resources, film crews and material\". Disputes arose over the scope of the buildings for the St. Barbara film village. Piscator threatened to cancel the work and renegotiated his contract with Mezhrabpomfilm in August 1931. When filming could finally have started in Odessa in mid-September 1931, stormy weather hindered the work. Mezhrabpomfilm then ordered the Soviet film director Lev Kuleshov to Odesa to provide Piscator with administrative support. Kuleshov was to work out a detailed shooting schedule for the film. At the same time, Piscator was given director Mikhail Doller as his first assistant. When they fell behind schedule again, the only option was to stop work temporarily, as the contracts with the German actors had already expired in November 1931.\nPiscator repeatedly complained to political authorities such as the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union about the desperate production conditions and the poor supervision of the ambitious film project by Mezhrabpomfilm. At the beginning of 1932, the Mezhrabpomfilm directors informed Piscator that the plan for a German version of the film would be dropped and that only a Russian version could be shot. Once again, a new contract was negotiated. After months of interruption, Piscator was able to resume filming in Odessa in late spring and summer 1932 with Soviet actors. Cooperation with the Soviet actors, who came from different acting traditions (Stanislavski, Meyerhold, Mayakovsky), proved difficult. In the fall of 1932, the film was shot in the rebuilt Mezhrabpomfilm studios in Moscow. In the spring of 1933, the National Socialists' rise to power finally shattered Piscator's intention of reaching a wider German audience with a political film. It was not until the fall of 1933 that he was able to take on the film music, but had to replace the composer Yuri Shaporin with younger colleagues due to insufficient cooperation. At the same time, it became apparent that film editing would take another few months. In the spring of 1934, Piscator completed the film project, which had taken almost three years with interruptions. The film cleared the final hurdle and was released by the main cinema administration. The official film premiere was set for October 1934.\n\n\n== Film poster ==\nThe film poster for the original Russian version from 1934 was designed by commercial artist Michail Weksler. The poster for the black-and-white film is designed in color. The film title is set off from the actual illustration at the top edge of the poster in white letters on a red background. The poster shows three characters from the film, the strike leader Kedennek, the boatman Bruyk with his characteristic tobacco pipe and the prostitute Marie in the background, on a sea background in strong yellow and green tones. Kedennek and Bruyk are identified as sailors and coastal fishermen by features such as striped clothing, slouch hats, pipes and spade beards. The poster thus focuses on the two contrasting positions within the communities of coastal fishermen, some of whom, following Kedennek, join the sailors' strike or, like the relatively well-off boat owner Bruyk, set out as \"strikebreakers\" to fish for Bredel. The upper image segment contains details of other film artists involved. (Western) European distribution companies advertised the subtitled export version for the (Western) European market, in some cases with their own film poster.\n\n\n== Reception at the time ==\n\nA few months before the official premiere in Moscow cinemas, a differentiated appraisal of the film was published in May 1934 in the Moscow-based Deutsche Zentral-Zeitung by the Soviet critic Sergei Dinamov, who was captivated by the artistic quality of the film and \"completely spellbound\". Nevertheless, Dinamov complained that the plot was so complicated that \"in the middle of the film, all the threads get tangled up and it becomes difficult to follow the story.\" A few weeks after Dinamov's review, the trade magazine \"Kino\", published by the Association of Filmmakers (ARRK), published a drastic review. The prominent author of this review, the avant-garde writer Osip Brik, criticized the film for its \"consistent pathos\", the \"diverging styles\" and the \"lack of dramatically growing tension.\" Brik blamed the management of Mezhrabpomfilm for the supposed failure of the project - a common approach for attacks on unpopular film projects at the time. The film company had not supported Piscator sufficiently in his foray into film directing and had not familiarized him with the actual needs of the Soviet cinema audience. Jasmin Arnold assumes that Brik carried out his attack on Meschrabpom \"with the approval of state authorities.\" The communication scientist Hermann Haarmann also interpreted the criticism as part of a \"staged press campaign\", which Brik had started under official pressure.\nThe following month, Piscator seconded a group of renowned directors of the Mezhrabpomfilm around Vsevolod Pudovkin in Izvestia, who praised Revolt of the Fishermen as a \"realistic work\", praised the \"closeness to life and authenticity of the individual portrayal of its heroes\", defended the film as \" clever tendency art\" and sharply attacked Brik.\nPiscator's feature film premiered in Moscow cinemas on October 5, 1934. Whether it was also shown in other parts of the country besides Moscow and presumably Leningrad is by no means certain, given the considerable lack of films in Soviet cinemas at the time. After the premiere in the Deutsche Zentral-Zeitung, the Austrian critic Hugo Huppert attributed the film a high topical value in view of the \"events in Spain\" - that is, an uprising by the Spanish socialists and the bourgeois Catalan government prior to the Spanish Civil War. The Hungarian film critic Béla Balázs, who reviewed the film for the Rote Zeitung, did not yet recognize \"a perfect masterpiece\" in the Revolt of the Fishermen, but nevertheless described Piscator as a great film director in view of the \"special nuances of the characters\". The Revolt of the Fishermen was the first sound film that fulfilled the expectation of a \"differentiated, so to speak psychologically deeper, so to speak three-dimensional characterization\". This can be seen in the impressive performance of the female characters as well as in the many nuances of the political characters.\nThe writer Ernst Ottwalt criticized in the German edition of the magazine Internationale Literatur, published in Moscow, that Revolt of the Fishermen lacked \"clarity and was difficult to understand\", but also decisively rejected Brik's argument. Piscator had \"dared [...] to portray the cause instead of the occasion, instead of the external, superficial tension of the plot its inner lawfulness with all consistency in artistic and political terms.\" The following year, Mezhrabpomfilm  distributed an export version of Revolt of the Fishermen, for which subtitles were produced in several languages. The export version could not be shown in Nazi Germany, but - even after the dissolution of Meschrabpom-Film in July 1936 - it was shown in several major Western European cities such as Zurich, Brussels and Paris. A Spanish film poster from 1936 points to screenings in Spain. There may also have been screenings in Copenhagen and Warsaw, as copies of the film were later found there.\nThe communist writer Arthur Koestler, who had attended a closed screening in Zurich, criticized the film in the Parisian exile press in view of its \"profound dishonesty\", as Piscator unrealistically assumed that the long road from the mass misery of the fishermen to the victorious revolution would be without complications. The investigative journalist Leo Lania, who reviewed the film for the exile organ Pariser Tageszeitung, took the opposite view. In Lania's view, Piscator had broken new aesthetic ground as a film director, similar to his theater work, as the Revolt of the Fishermen combined various stylistic elements into a work of art that could claim to convey \"important approaches for the further development of a great political mass drama\".\n\n\n== Rediscovery in Germany ==\n\nAt the 6th West German Short Film Festival, which was held in Oberhausen in February and March 1960, the film was officially screened for the first time in West Germany on March 4, 1960, in a trimmed, 65-minute print. The founder of the West German Short Film Festival, Hilmar Hoffmann, had learned of the existence of two 16-mm copies of the film in the Cinémathèque royale de Belgique and the Cinémathèque française the previous year. The director of the Belgian Cinémathèque, Jacques Ledoux, had agreed to a screening of The Fishermen's Revolt as part of a retrospective in Oberhausen. The Film-Telegramm was impressed by the dynamic crowd scenes: \"Ant-like, nervous and feverish, the back and forth swaying of fear and anger in the shooting scenes - the counter-movements of the masses culminate in the spirited counter-cutting of the images to create oppressive drama. \" The magazine Filmforum praised the masterful direction of the images: \"When a clenched fist stretches towards the ceiling and is captured by the camera together with a lamp, when the Bible of the unctuous clergyman is torn apart at the funeral and the sharp sea wind drives the leaves across the cemetery [...] - the image content is always skillfully assigned to the sequence of events.\" Subsequently, the film was increasingly shown in West German film clubs. Piscator was pleased with the positive media response in West Germany, but found the Belgian copy of his film \"dreadful and completely wrongly edited.\"\nThe film became known to a wider West German audience when it was shown on West German television (NDR) on February 20, 1965, with an introduction by Hilmar Hoffmann. The film critic Dietrich Kuhlbrodt described the film on the occasion of the television premiere as an \"irreplaceable document of German film history\" and praised Piscator's \"further development of Eisenstein's and Pudowkin's montage principles.\" The official premiere in the GDR followed on May 1, 1965, in the \"Archivfilmtheater\" Camera, the cinema of the State Film Archive of the GDR, in East Berlin. An information sheet from the GDR State Film Archive characterized the Revolt of the Fishermen as one of the \"top works of the sound film era in the Soviet Union\" and placed the film in a row with other masterpieces: \"With its thrillingly topical message, the magnificently adequate form that compels passionate partisanship, it [i.e. the work] has earned an honorable place in film history alongside such masterpieces as 'Chapayev' or 'The Road to Life'. \" In November 1975, the film was also shown in a \"new adaptation\" on GDR television (DFF 2) on the occasion of Anna Seghers' 75th birthday.\nA restored version, which had been reconstituted from several film prints, was presented by Neue Visionen Filmverleih in Berlin on March 1, 2001. Hermann Haarmann commented the following year in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung: \"Piscator's film is a work of art of special quality, which not only borrows from the greats of 'Russian film' (Alfred Kerr) such as Eisenstein and Pudovkin, but also independently develops the young medium in terms of visual and sound dramaturgy. Against Eisenstein's advice, Piscator insists on moving the camera. He attaches it to the bow of a ship or lets it go on a roundabout. Cross-fades are another creative device. However, this was by no means acceptable to Joseph Stalin, who expressed his disapproval of the foreigner Piscator in a private preview in the Kremlin.\"\nPiscator's feature film was the object of an installation by Frankfurt artist Jeronimo Voss, which was shown at the Frankfurter Kunstverein (2010), in a Berlin gallery (solo exhibition, 2011), at the Vienna Secession (2013) and at the Württembergischer Kunstverein Stuttgart (2013/14). Voss based his work on the experience of the failure of Piscator's intention - at the time of the film's premiere, the NSDAP, against which the film was supposed to be directed, was already in power. Voss worked with a video and overhead projector and ink drawings on film. According to the journalist Hili Perlson, Voss' phantasmagorical reconstruction of Piscator's film project of the 1930s was not lost to history, \"but rather sets its failure as a starting point for the present.\" In its \"Retrospective 2012: The Red Dream Factory\", the 2012 Berlinale featured the German premiere of a 60-minute silent version of the film. The silent film version was accompanied by fragments of a film score by Hanns Eisler. Eisler had composed two polyphonic choruses with piano accompaniment for the original German version of the film in the early summer of 1931, which premiered in Berlin on February 12, 2012. The choral fragments were found in the Hanns Eisler Archive of the Berlin Academy of Arts. Seven decades after its premiere, the film remained dramaturgically effective, as documented by the impressions of one critic: \"When the lights go on in the hall, you feel a little disheveled. With the ears still in a time when something was about to happen, with the eyes already back in festival mode [...].\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nArnold, Jasmin (2003).

        "content": "Christopher Stanger (1759 – 21 September 1834) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nStanger was the son of a merchant of Whitehaven. He was born in 1759. His family had for several centuries owned estates near Keswick, and a township to the west of Derwentwater once bore their name (Nicolson and Burn, History of Westmoreland and Cumberland, ii. 68). Stanger, after having been apprenticed to a surgeon at Newcastle-on-Tyne, graduated M.D. at Edinburgh on 24 June 1783. His dissertation bore the title ‘De iis quæ ad Sanitatem conservandam plurimum conferre videntur.’ He next studied for four years at the chief medical schools of the continent, including Paris, Vienna, Montpellier, Göttingen, and Leyden. On his return he established a practice in London, and was admitted L.R.C.P. on 30 September 1789. Next year he was appointed Gresham professor of medicine, and in 1792 became physician to the Foundling Hospital.\nIn June 1793 Stanger was chosen to act with John Cooke and William Charles Wells on a committee formed by the licentiates of the Royal College of Physicians to present an address to the college claiming to be admitted fellows. Among the signatories was John Aikin, the biographer, who was in consequence refused the use of the college library (Memoir, ed. Lucy Aikin, p. 178). The petitioners were excluded under a by-law which declared that fellows should be graduates of Oxford or Cambridge, despite the eminence of the medical school of Edinburgh. The college refused to receive the address, and Stanger applied to the law-courts. On 27 January 1796 the court of king's bench granted a rule to compel the president and fellows to show cause why they should not admit Stanger. On 23 April, when Erskine appeared for the defendants, the rule was discharged by Lord Chief-justice Kenyon on the ground of an informality in Stanger's application. The case was reopened in the autumn, and was argued by Adair, Law, Chambre, and Christian for the plaintiffs, with Erskine, Warren, and Gibbs for the defendants, 13–16 May 1797; but the court unanimously refused the mandamus. In 1798 Stanger appealed to the public in ‘A Justification of the Right of every well-educated Physician of fair character and mature age, residing within the Jurisdiction of the College of Physicians of London, to be admitted a fellow if competent.’ In this able pamphlet it was shown that Lord Mansfield had decided in 1767 that the college were bound under their charter to admit as fellows all duly qualified licentiates of whatever university. But Stanger's efforts produced little effect. Isaac Schomberg had unavailingly put forth a somewhat similar claim in 1753. Stanger, who possessed extensive attainments and great energy, also published ‘Remarks on the Necessity and Means of suppressing Contagious Fevers in the Metropolis,’ 1802, 12mo, and contributed a paper on ‘Coughs’ to the ‘Transactions of the Medical and Chirurgical Society.’ He died in London on 21 September 1834.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Norgate, Gerald le Grys (1898). \"Stanger, Christopher\".

        "content": "Regencycore or, sometimes, royalcore, is a fashion style and internet aesthetic inspired by clothing worn in early 19th-century Europe. The rise of regencycore is widely attributed to the popularity of the Netflix television series Bridgerton, which takes place in a fictionalized version of Regency era Britain and premiered at the end of 2020.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe enduring popularity of the English author Jane Austen led to a long tradition of fiction inspired by works like Pride and Prejudice or Emma, including movie and television adaptations as well as the romance novel sub-genre of Regency romance, established by the historical novelist Georgette Heyer. Among these include the series Bridgerton, which was adapted for television by Netflix in 2020. The series' lead costume designer is Ellen Mirojnick, who chose to create an anachronistic and exaggerated version of Regency fashion that would feel \"scandalous and modern.\" Mirojnick found inspiration in the 1950s and 1960s, particularly Dior's New Look. Although the empire waist silhouette was maintained, elements that were common during the Regency era such as bonnets and muslin fabric were eliminated, and detail and color were added with embellishments such as glitter and fabrics like organza or tulle.\nAfter the debut of Bridgerton in December 2020, the term \"regencycore\" first began to appear in the beginning of 2021. Some writers connected the trend to the distress and isolation caused by the COVID-19 lockdowns, which caused audiences to crave nostalgic, escapist fantasy.\nRegencycore elements appeared in the 2022 Met Gala, which was themed \"Gilded Glamour\" after the Gilded Age.\nAfter the debut of the second season of Bridgerton in March 2022, internet searches for terms like \"regency dress,\" \"silk gloves,\" and \"cropped jackets\" increased significantly.\n\n\n== Aesthetic elements ==\nThe regencycore aesthetic is associated with a number of specific fashion elements including low, square necklines, pearl and feather accessories, empire and babydoll silhouettes, puffed or cap sleeves, opera gloves, and elaborate headgear.\n\nHowever, regencycore also encompasses a general feeling of opulence and hyper-femininity, as well as styles more associated with the Victorian era or Marie Antoinette, such as full-length corsets (short stays were more common during the Regency period) and powdered wigs. Regencycore may be extended to interior design, makeup, and hairdressing. The trend is also associated with Selkie, a clothing brand known for its viral chiffon puff-sleeved dresses.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nCoquette aesthetic\nCottagecore\nJaneite\nLight academia\nLiving history\nNeo-Victorian\nRococo, 18th-century aesthetic movement characterized by opulence and drama\nLolita fashion, Japanese street style inspired by Rococo and Victorian clothing\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sheikh Alparslan Kuytul is a Salafi cleric from Turkey who leads the Furkan Education and Service Foundation.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAlparslan Kuytul was born in 1965 in Karataş. He graduated from Çukurova University, Faculty of Architecture-Engineering, Department of Civil Engineering in 1991. Between 1993 and 1997, he studied in the Islamic Law of the Faculty of Sharia at Al-Azhar University. During his years at Al-Azhar University, he founded the Furkan Education and Service Foundation. Kuytul has a channel called Furkan TV. He has also been the editor-in-chief of Furkan Nesli magazine since 2011. Alparslan Kuytul said in a program that he belonged to the Hanafi school. He is married to Semra Kuytul and has 5 children.\n\n\n== Views ==\nKuytul advocates for Sharia law in Turkey, and is also a critic of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. He became even more critical of Erdoğan following his handling of the 2016 coup attempt and the state of emergency. Kuytul was baselessly accused by Erdoğanists of supporting the Islamic State, PKK, and FETÖ. He denied these claims, saying \"is there such person in the world? FETÖ, PKK, ISIS, and Al-Qaeda all at once, is there such person in the world?\" Kuytul was described as being the fiercest critic of Erdoğan among Islamists in Turkey. Kuytul once stated that if the AKP ever \"declares war\", him and his supporters would not back away. He refers to the AKP as ZKP (Zülüm Kalkınma Partisi) meaning \"Oppressive Development Party\".\nHe is a Pan-Islamist and stated that \"the infidel has already divided us into 50–60 pieces. We shouldn't want to be divided again. If the Turks want a Turkish state, the Kurds will want a Kurdish state as a result. Arabs will also want an Arab state. But if they all want the Islamic state, then they can unite. Every race must abandon the understanding of the nation-state. We are already very divided, will we be divided again? Therefore, everyone should understand the Quran in order not to be divided again. We must return to Islamic civilization. Whatever rights the Quran gives to every race, everyone will consent to those rights, with its Turks, Kurds, Arabs. We will all lose when we are divided. Turks, Kurds, and Arabs. Muslims should not be supporters of a nation-state, they should not be supporters of a racial state. All of them should have an understanding of a religion-state. We cannot change our race, but we are all Muslims. We unite on this. We can live in brotherhood in an Islamic civilization, as we did in the past.\"\nKuytul was involved in a feud with Devlet Bahçeli and Süleyman Soylu. In April 2022, following a raid on Kuytul's Furkan Foundation in Adana, Kuytul claimed that \"the MHP completely claimed responsibility for the incident. There is no one who does not know that the police are already completely under the control of the MHP, it was obvious from the mustache of all the policemen who attacked us. They set up a special team, they all agreed and filled the young riot police. They brought those young policemen there and attacked us and abused our rights.\"\nKuytul is a long-time critic of the Turkish government's policies towards Kurds, and views the oppressive policies towards Kurds as un-Islamic. He supports the recognition of the Kurdish language in Turkey, as well as Kurdish education in schools. He claimed that Kurdish nationalism is reactionary and the only way it would disappear is if Turkish nationalism also disappears and both groups agree on Islam.\nHe criticised the Republic of Turkey and claimed that it is against Islam due to it being a nation state based on Turks. He also stated that Turkish soldiers who died for the sake of nationalism, racism, or opportunism, do not deserve to be called \"şehit\". He criticised the Victory Party and accused it of being \"the most racist party\".\nKuytul was involved in a feud with Cübbeli Ahmet as well. Ahmet, known for his nationalist sentiments and support for Erdoğan, accused Kuytul and the Furkan Foundation of being allied with the PKK and CHP to divide Turkey.\nHe claimed that any Muslim who works with the United States or Russia will only receive betrayal in the end.\nKuytul criticised the Turkish involvement in the Syrian civil war, and was arrested in February 2018 for criticising the Afrin offensive. He claimed that Turkey's operation in Afrin was motivated only by Anti-Kurdism, and stated \"why does Turkey agree with the Arab state in Iraq and Syria at its borders, but does not consent to a Kurdish state? As a Muslim, I am not satisfied with a Kurdish, Turkish or Arab state. I am satisfied with the Islamic state and its civilization. I'm not saying that Turkey should be satisfied with the Kurdish state. I say they are all wrong. If we are Muslims, we will have the understanding of the ummah, not the understanding of race.\"\n\n\n== Cases ==\nKuytul, who was detained on 30 January 2018, was arrested on 8 February 2018. In addition to the case in which he was tried for \"establishing a criminal organization and qualified fraud\", another case was filed against him in July 2018 for \"supporting terrorist organizations\". Released on 5 December 2019. Three years later, the decision was made in the case where he was tried and he was acquitted on 3 November 2020.\nKuytul, who was arrested again by the Adana High Criminal Court on 9 May 2022, and put in the cell in Ağrı Prison, was demanded for 38 years and 6 months in prison for the charges of \"establishing an organization for the purpose of committing a crime\", \"being a member of the organization established for the purpose of committing a crime\", \"qualified looting\", \"depriving the person of his freedom by using algebra, violence and cheating\", \"deliberate injury\". He was released from prison on 16 June 2023.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Musée Pierre-Noël is an art and history museum located in Saint-Dié-des-Vosges. Designated as a Museum of France, it is named after Pierre Noël, the mayor of the city from 1965 to 1977. An inscription engraved on the modern part of the building recalls its original purpose, \"museum of life in the High Vosges,\" but the collections now also feature a significant focus on contemporary art.\n\n\n== History ==\nSince the construction of the museum in 1977, the colonnade of the former episcopal palace built on the north side of the cathedral by architect Jean-Michel Carbonnar in 1782 provides access to this new space.\nThe medieval part is located on the side of Rue Saint-Charles, to the right of the main entrance. There, visitors can discover a covered staircase, the last vestige of the walls once built to consolidate the terrain of the church district created on the Mont, which notably provided access to an arm of the Meurthe, diverted since then. A breach in this wall was made in 1781 during the construction of the episcopal palace.\nThe vast modern building opened to the public in 1977 incorporates this old staircase, classified as a historical monument like the colonnade.\nThis new building, completed between 1973 and 1976, is the work of Aldo Travaglini, an architect who arrived in Saint-Dié in 1947. Outside, the three faux-relief panels (Promenade in a park, The Banquet, and The movement towards knowledge) were designed by Françoise Malaprade.\nAlbert Ronsin directed the Museum and the Library from 1960 to 1990, while also writing a series of books devoted to the history of the city.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of museums in France\n\n\n== References ==",

He served the office of censor in 1831, and he was declared an elect on 20 March 1844. He was elected assistant-physician to St. Thomas's Hospital on 11 December 1816, and on 1 October 1817 he was elected physician to the charity in the room of William Lister, an office he retained until his death.\nWilliams died at his house in Lower Bedford Place on 24 November 1845. He occupied himself for many years in an attempt to ascertain the virtues and properties of the drugs then in common use, for he was engaged throughout his life in seeking for specific remedies to cure disease. In the course of these inquiries he discovered the curative power of iodide of potassium in the later stages of syphilis. He also introduced bromide of potassium into English practice, though he did not employ it in the treatment of epilepsy. He was the author of ‘Elements of Medicine,’ London, 1836–41, 2 vols. 8vo.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Power, D'Arcy (1900). \"Williams, Robert (1787?-1845)\".

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "William Ward, or Warde, (1534–1604?) was an English physician and translator.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWard was born at Landbeach, Cambridgeshire, in 1534, was educated at Eton, whence he was elected scholar of King's College, Cambridge, 13 August 1550. On 14 August 1553 he became fellow. He proceeded B.A. in 1553–4, and M.A. in 1558. On 27 Feb. 1551–2 the provost of his college requested him to take up the study of medicine, and he became M.D. in 1567. In 1568 he vacated his fellowship. His name is attached to the petition signed in 1572 against the new statutes of the university. Letters patent dated from Westminster, 8 November 1596 (Rymer, xvi. 303), appoint ‘Willielmus Warde’ and William Burton ‘readers in medicine or the medical art’ in the university of Cambridge, with a stipend of 40l. The document speaks of the position as hitherto held, under letters patent, by Ward alone. Ward is mentioned again in 1601 in a list of Cambridge officials as queen's professor of physic. The list occurs at the end of a ‘Project for the Government of the University of Cambridge’ (Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1601–3, p. 116). It is probably in virtue of his official post at Cambridge that Ward is spoken of as physician to Queen Elizabeth and King James. He probably died soon after James's accession. In 1590 he gave to the parish of Great St. Mary, Cambridge, seven and a half acres of arable land in ‘Howsfield,’ and two acres of meadow land in Chesterton.\nWard was author of: \n\n‘The Secretes of the Reverende Maister Alexis Piemont. Containyng excellent remedies against divers diseases and other accidents, with the manner to make distillations, parfumes, confitures, diynges, colours, fusions, and meltynges. … Translated out of French into English by William Warde. Imprinted at London by John Kingstone for Nicolas Inglande, dwellinge in Poules Churchyarde, Anno 1558. Mens. Novemb.,’ b.l., 4to. This apparently is the first edition of this work, containing only the first part, and consisting of six books. There is another edition (Ames, Typogr. Antiq. ed. Herbert, ii. 844) ‘Londini, Anno 1559, 12 die Mens. Novemb.,’ printed ‘by H. Sutton, dwelling in Paternoster rowe at the signe of the blacke Moryan, Anno 1559;’ and yet another (Brit. Mus. Libr. Cat.), also in 1559, ‘imprinted for J. Wight, Londini.’ These contain a dedicatory letter by Ward to the Earl of Bedford, notable for its protest against the folly of ‘some curious Christians among us nowadays … which most impudently despise all manner of medicines,’ and for its defence of the ‘heavenly science’ of physic. Ward mentions Christopher Plantin's edition of a French translation (Antwerp, 1557) as his original. The work itself has not much claim to scientific method or accuracy, but became very popular as a treasury of medical and other knowledge in all the countries of Europe. Of this first part numerous editions were published in England. In 1580 it is ‘newlie corrected and amended and also somewhat enlarged in certain places.’ W. Stansby printed an edition in 1615. This first part of the ‘Secrets’ occurs usually bound up with ‘The Seconde Parte of the Secrets of Maister Alexis of Piemont, by him collected out of divers excellent authors and newly translated out of French into English. With a general table of all the matters contayned in the sayde Booke. By Will. Warde,’ b.l., n.d., 4to, and 1560, and 1563. This is usually followed by ‘The thyrde and last parte of the Secretes of the Reverende Maister Alexis of Piemont … Englished by Wyllyam Warde,’ 1562, 4to, 1566, 1588, and 1615. This contains six books, like the first part. Here Ward's work seems to have ended; but in many copies of the book a fourth and fifth part are added, translated by R. Androse.\n‘Thre notable sermones made by the godly and famous Clerke, Maister John Calvyn, on thre severall Sondayes in Maye, the yere 1561, upon the Psalm 46. … Englished by William Warde. Printed at London by Rouland Hill, dwellynge in Gutter Lane, at the sygne of the halfe Egle and the Keye,’ 1562, 16mo, b.l.\n‘The most excellent, profitable, and pleasaunt Booke of the famous doctor and expert astrologian Arcandam or Aleandrin, to finde the fatall destiny, constellation, complexion, and naturall inclination of every man and childe by his birth. With an addition of Phisiognomy, very pleasant to read. Now newly tourned out of French into our vulgar tongue by William Warde,’ London, 1578, 8vo, 1592, 1626, 1630, 1670. This is a work translated into Latin from ‘a confused and indistinct’ original by Richard Roussat, ‘Canonicus Lingoniensis,’ and published at Paris in 1542.\nThere is a copy of Latin verses by Ward before James Robothum's ‘Pleausaunt and wittie Playe of the Cheastes [i.e. chess] … Lately translated out of Italian into French: and now set furth in Englishe,’ London, 1562. Possibly Ward translated the French (Ames, Typogr. Antiq. ed. Herbert, ii. 803–4). ‘Gods Arrowes, or two Sermons concerning the Visitation of God by the Pestilence,’ London, 1607, 8vo, attributed in the ‘British Museum Catalogue’ to William Warde, are by a London minister of that name who can hardly have been identical with the Cambridge professor.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Bayne, Ronald (1899). \"Ward, William (1534-1604?)\".

        "content": "Kate Barnes (born 1953 in Burlington, Vermont) is an American musician, composer, and publisher who specializes in English country dance. She has compiled three collections of dance music that are considered the standard source for Playford and ‘barn’ style’ of English country dance. Including over 1,200 traditional and modern pieces, The Barnes Book of English Country Dance Tunes Volumes I, II, and III were published under Barnes’ name given at birth, Peter. She was given a lifetime achievement award in 2020 for her contributions to traditional music by the Country Dance and Song Society (CDSS) in 2020. In addition to her foundational work creating a shared source of sheet music, this wark also reflects her membership in the band Bare Necessities in Boston.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nKate Barnes was born in 1953 in Burlington, Vermont, and grew up in Waltham, Massachusetts. She graduated from high school  in 1971 before receiving a degree in English from Moravian University in 1975.\n\n\n== Musical career ==\nKate Barnes plays piano, flute, whistles and guitar, and a variety of other instruments, according to the CDSS. She dates her musical career to 1977. Since that time she has played with two dozen named bands and any number of pickup bands. She worked extensively with Irish traditional singer Cathie Ryan as a keyboard and wind player from 2001 to 2007. She is best known for her work with the band Bare Necessities but has also appeared with The Latter-Day Lizards, Yankee Ingenuity, Les Z Boys, Kestral, Big Bandemonium, among others.  She has recorded 15 CDs in the Boston Country Dance Center Series under her birth name of Peter Barnes, and is credited on 80 recordings in all. As Kate Barnes, she recorded At Rainbow's End, 14 tunes that accompany the late English choreographer Fried de Metz Herman's Choice Morsels collection. The CDSS said in 2021 that Barnes averaged \"over 250 events per year since 1980\" and is \"arguably one of New England's busiest and most sought after musicians.\" She is also and active ceramics artist.\n\n\n== Awards and publications ==\nKate Barnes received the Country Dance and Song Society's 2020 Lifetime Contribution award \"in recognition of many years of performance and teaching at CDSS programs, the international importance of her publications, her generosity of spirit when running music workshops, and her contributions to current and future communities.\"\nIn addition to her recordings, Barnes's first English country dance tune collection (as Peter Barnes) was released by Canis Publishing in 1986 and revised in 1995. Volume II followed in 2005, and Volume III in 2019. Each book indexes the previous ones. Volume I includes \"A Quick and Dirty Guide to English Dance Accompaniment Styles\"; Volume II responded to a growing demand for more tunes, she said in a preface (quipping that it should have been named \"The Barnes Edition of ‘Not In Barnes’ Tunes\"); and Volume III responded to a \"ferment of creativity\" in English dance, she wrote in the preface. While copyrighted by Peter, the preface to Volume III is signed by Kate. She also published \"Interview With a Vamper,\" advice on accompanying American contra and square dancing on a piano. A book of tunes for couples dances, \"A Little Couple-Dancemusik\" was published in print in 1992 but as of 2023 was sold out. It is still available as a digital version.\n\n\n== Additional material ==\nBarnes, Peter. \"A Little Couple Dancemusik.\" Greenfield, MA, Canis Publishing, 1992.\nBarnes. \"Interview with a Vamper,\" Greenfield, MA, Canis Publishing, 1993.\nBarnes. \"The Barnes Book of English Country Dance Tunes\" Vol. I, Greenfield, MA, Canis Publishing, 1995–2009.\n\"The Barnes Book of English Country Dance Tunes\" Vol. II, 2005–2015.\n\"The Barnes Book of English Country Dance Tunes\" Vol. III, 2019.\nExample: Barnes, Anna Patton and Karen Axelrod at Northern Roots 2012 festival, Brattleboro Kate Barnes, Anna Patton, and Karen Axelrod at Northern Roots 2012\nThe Round Cambridge - Dance and Music Resources | The Round\nBare Necessities: Facebook\nLatter-Day Lizards: Schedule - The Latter Day Lizards\nCountry Dance and Song Society (Easthampton, MA) <Homepage>\nCDSS camp: Kate Barnes\nJeff Kaufmann, Contra: Looking back 25 years\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sala Neoplastyczna (Neoplastic Room) is a permanent exhibition space at Muzeum Sztuki in Łódź originally designed by the Polish avant-garde artist Władysław Strzemiński in collaboration with the director of the museum Marian Minich in 1948. It was intended to showcase the works by European avant-garde artists of the interwar period, including Katarzyna Kobro, Theo van Doesburg and Henryk Berlewi, among others.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Design and installation (1948) ===\nThe idea for the Neoplastic Room emerged in the aftermath of World War II when the director Marian Minich, who had been leading the institution since 1935, expressed a desire to create a dedicated space for displaying works by European interwar avant-garde artists from the museum's collection. It was intended for the museum's new location at the Poznański family palace on Więckowskiego Street.The Neoplastic Room was designed in 1948 by Władysław Strzemiński, one of the pivotal artists associated with Polish Constructivism and a co-founder of the a.r. group, which formed the core of the museum's pre-war collection. Strzemiński's project for the room was based on a 1931 manifesto he wrote together with his wife Katarzyna Kobro, titled Composition of Space: Calculations of Space-Time Rhythm.Intended to achieve a \"balance of harmony of space\", the Neoplastic Room and its name were inspired by the ideas and visual vocabulary of the Dutch Neoplasticism movement originally established by Piet Mondrian and Theo van Doesburg. The space, \"divided into planes based on strict mathematical calculations and painted with basic colours (red, blue, and yellow)\", was augmented by vertical and horizontal arrangement in white, gray, and black.: 221 The Neoplastic Room originally featured works by Berlewi, van Doesburg, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, Vilmos Huszár, Jean Hélion, Henryk Stażewski, and Georges Vantongerloo.: 221 In addition to displaying paintings, the room showcased abstract sculptures by Kobro called Spatial Compositions (Kompozycje Przestrzenne), which were placed on custom-designed glass pedestals.: 70 \n\n\n=== Later history (1960-now) ===\nThe Neoplastic Room survived only until October 1, 1950, when it was shut down due to the imposition of the Socialist Realist doctrine in Stalinist Poland. This followed the firing of Strzemiński from the Łódź Academy of Fine Arts earlier that year by the deputy minister of culture and arts Włodzimierz Sokorski. The space was painted over and the works were moved to warehouses, as modernism and avant-garde ran counter to Stalinist cultural policies. The room was reconstructed in 1960 by Bolesław Utkin, a student of Strzemiński, based on preserved photos. Since then, the room has been renovated multiple times and has become the most prominent permanent exhibition space at the museum.\n\n\n== References ==",

The game disk came with questions for math or spelling, with expansion disks for Trivia 1 and 2, Science, History, Geography, Spelling 1 and 2, Math 1 and 2, Math Concepts, Language, and Social Studies.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nLeah Wesolowski reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \"As early as the original Discovery, reviewers thought the concept was good, but the implementation was poor. Nothing has really changed. With a new digitized voice, the ability to correct mathematical errors and a movement system in which characters didn't continually fall down hatches (easier than characters fall down ladders in Shadow of the Beast), the game might be worthwhile. As it is, Discovery 2.0 is only likely to make one scream.\"\nAmazing Computer Magazine wrote that \"Discovery, the award-winning educational program, has now become even better.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The majority of the Chinese diaspora in the Philippines is made up of Fujianese descent, with a small percentage of Cantonese from Guangdong and Hong Kong. During the Spanish period, many Chinese from Fujian were enticed by the Galleon Trade, which was one of the main reasons for the influx of Chinese in the Philippines. Those who converted to Catholicism were placed in Binondo, and those who did not were in Parian. Having a Hispanized Filipino-Chinese surname signifies that a Chinese person has become Catholic. Some adopted the surnames of their Spanish godparents, while others combined modified Chinese names and added honorifics such as -co, -son, and -zon at the end. Many of them intermarried with Filipinos and were integrated into Philippine society. Filipinos who possess those surnames have Chinese lineage.\n\n\n== Hispanized surnames ==\nA\n\nAhkiong\nAndicoy\nAngangco\nAngpauco\nAngtuaco\nAusan\nAyzon\nB\n\nBanzon\nBengco\nBengzon\nBiazon\nBonzon\nBuncio\nBuyco\nBuzon\nC\n\nCangco\nCayco\nChanchinco\nChanco\nChengcuenca\nChichioco\nChincuanco\nChiongbian\nChionglo\nChipeco\nChoa\nChoochan\nChuachiaco\nChuakay\nChuapoco\nChuaquico\nChuateco\nChuatoco\nChuidian\nCiciongco\nCiocon\nCojuangco\nCojunco\nColayco\nConcon\nCongco\nCongson\nConsunji\nCopiaco\nCoquia\nCoseteng\nCosico\nCucueco\nCuizon\nCutiongco\nCuyegkeng\nD\n\nDe Pan\nDeonzon\nDimson\nDinglasan\nDiokno\nDiyakson\nDizon\nDoratan\nDy-Buncio\nDycaico\nDyliaco\nDypiangco\nDyquiangco\nDysangco\nG\n\nGandionco\nGanzon\nGochoco\nGoduco\nGoking\nGokongwei\nGolamco\nGolangco\nGoquingco\nGoquiolay\nGosiengfiao\nGosiengpao\nGosioco\nGosoc\nGosuico\nGosum\nGotauco\nGotiangco\nGotianse\nGouchico\nGoyanco\nGozon\nGuanlao\nGuanzon\nGuiao\nGuysayko\nH\n\nHenson\nHizon\nI\n\nIson\nJ\n\nJante\nJapson\nJoco\nJocson\nJoson\nJunco\nK\n\nKiamco\nKilayko\nKimpo\nKison\nL\n\nLacson\nLandicho\nLantin\nLaoinco\nLauchengco\nLaudico\nLauzon\nLawsin\nLeyson\nLiamzon\nLibongco\nLicauco\nLichauco\nLicuanan\nLam-co\nLimcaco\nLimcangco\nLimcaoco\nLimchangco\nLimdico\nLimjap\nLimjoco\nLimson\nLiongson\nLitonjua\nLittaua\nLoangco\nLocsin\nLopa\nLuansing\nM\n\nMapua\nMonton\nMonzon\nN\n\nNacu\nNangpi\nNgSinco\nNibungco\nO\n\nOchoa\nOlimpo\nOngchangco\nOngkeko\nOngkingco\nOnglatco\nOngpauco\nOngpin\nOngsiaco\nOngsiapco\nOngsingco\nOngtengco\nP\n\nPaulin\nPe-Benito\nPecaoco\nPecson\nPefianco\nPesayco\nQ\n\nQuengua\nQuetua\nQueveco\nQuiambao\nQuiason\nQuibuyen\nQuicho\nQuimbo\nQuimpo\nQuimque\nQuimson\nQuindipan\nQuingco\nQuiocho\nQuiocson\nQuiogue\nQuison / Quizon\nQuisumbing\nS\n\nSamson\nSandico\nSangco\nSanqui\nSason\nSayson\nSendico\nSia\nSiapuatco\nSiazon\nSibayanSy\nSicangco\nSideco\nSimsuangco\nSindico\nSingco\nSingson\nSiongco\nSioson\nSipin\nSison\nSongco\nSongcuya\nSuaco\nSuico\nSunico\nSuntay\nSycip\nSy-Cotio\nSyjuco\nSyquia\nSytangco\nSytengco\nT\n\nTablante\nTambunting\nTanangco\nTanchanco\nTanchoco\nTancinco\nTancongco\nTangco\nTangkiang\nTanhehco\nTanhueco\nTanjosoy\nTanjuatco\nTanlimco\nTanquingcen\nTanseco\nTansiongco\nTantoco\nTantuico\nTecson\nTeehankee\nTengco\nTengonciang\nTetangco\nTiamson\nTiangco\nTiaoqui\nTichepco\nTinoco\nTintiangco\nTioleco\nTiongco\nTiongson\nTioseco\nTiotuyco\nTizon\nTongson\nTuason\nTuico\nU\n\nUichico\nUson\nUylamco\nUytangco\nUytengsu\nUytingco\nUysiuseng\nV\n\nVianzon\nVinzon\nW\n\nWilwayco\nWycoco\nY\n\nYalung\nYambao\nYamson\nYance\nYapchulay\nYapjoco\nYaptangco\nYaptenco\nYaptinchay\nYatco\nYengko\nYongque\nYuchengco\nYujico\nYulo\nYunsay\nYupangco\nYusingco\nYuson / Yuzon\nYuviengco\nYuyitung\n\n\n== References ==",

As of April 2024, it serves students from kindergarten to eighth grade.\n\n\n== History ==\nVoice Charter School was founded in 2008.\nFollowing the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, some students declined their spots at the school. Because of this, the school decided to offer spots to 70 children from asylum-seeking families. By 2023, the school's population included 267 migrant students, the most of any charter school in the state.\n\n\n== Education ==\nAll students are required to take music classes; in elementary school, these music classes are held daily. For students for whom English was not their first language, the music classes also help them with language acquisition.\nThe school also offers a soccer and track program, open to students regardless of gender.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "John Sherwen (1749 – 2 September 1826) was an English physician and archaeologist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSherwen is said to have been born in Cumberland in 1749, and to have been related to the family of Curwen. He was a pupil at St Thomas' Hospital, London, and passed as a surgeon. In 1769 he was at Acheen in Sumatra, the voyage thither from Falmouth having taken five months, and he was afterwards at Calcutta and in the Bay of Bengal. At this time he was in the service of the East India Company. In 1771 he returned to England and practised as a surgeon at Enfield in Middlesex, where he was friendly with Richard Gough, and frequently contributed to the medical journals. The titles of several of his papers are inserted in Robert Watt's ‘Bibliotheca Britannica,’ and a silver medal for his contributions was given him by the Medical Society in March 1788.\nSherwen was admitted M.D. of Aberdeen University on 14 February 1798 (Anderson, Aberdeen Graduates, 1893, p. 143), and on 4 May 1802 he became an extra-licentiate of the College of Physicians in London. In 1802 he paid a visit to Paris. His first wife was Douglas, posthumous daughter of Duncan Campbell of Salt Spring, Jamaica. She visited Bath for her health, and died there on 16 June 1804, when a monument to her memory was erected in Bath Abbey. A year or two later Sherwen settled permanently in Bath, occupying 18 Great Stanhope Street, and obtaining some medical practice.  He married, on 12 November 1807, Lydia Ann (1773–1851), daughter of the Rev. Mr. Dannett, of Liverpool.  He had made a patient study of the early English writers, and his library contained some rare volumes of Elizabethan literature. From 1808 to 1813 he was a frequent contributor to the ‘Gentleman's Magazine,’ mainly on the authenticity of the ‘Rowley’ poems, of the genuineness of which he was a keen advocate. He assisted John Britton in his work on Bath Abbey (Preface, p. xii), and Britton dedicated to him the view of the abbey church from the south side (p. 60). Though he retained his house at Bath he made frequent trips to Enfield, and died there on 2 September 1826. \nSherwen published in 1809 his ‘Introduction to an Examination of some part of the Internal Evidence respecting the Antiquity and Authenticity of certain Publications,’ by Rowley or Chatterton. The copy at the British Museum was corrected by him for a further issue, but it did not reach a new edition; and the promised second part of his ‘Examination’ was never published. One fair copy of his full observations on this controversy is in the British Museum Additional MSS. 6388 and 6389; another is in the Bath Institution. Two quarto volumes of his annotations on Shakespeare are in that institution, and at the British Museum there are several books on the Chatterton controversy, with many manuscript notes by him.\nSherwen was also author of ‘Cursory Remarks on the Marine Scurvy’ (anon.), 1782, and ‘Observations on the Diseased and Contracted Urinary Bladder,’ 1799. The ‘Medical Spectator’ (vols. i. ii. and small part of iii. dated 1794) is attributed to him. \nAdditional publications, digitized by the National Library of Medicine, include:\n\nDr. Sherwen, on Digitalis (1800)\nObservations on Bilious Disorders (1801)\nObservations on the Advantages of Artificially Scorbuticizing the System in Some Circumstances (1814).\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Henderson, Thomas Finlayson (1886). \"Sherwen, John\".

        "content": "Banff and Macduff Lifeboat Station is a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboat station, located in Banff, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. \nThe lifeboat station in this part of Aberdeenshire has been located in various locations in Banff & Macduff, and between 1923 and 1969, the lifeboat was located at Whitehills, three miles to the west of Macduff. Supporters and volunteers treat the station as 'one', regardless of the location. The current Macduff Lifeboat Station became operational in March 1974. \n\n\n== History ==\nIn June 1859, the RNLI put out the message that it was desirous to extend its work of usefulness to the Coasts of Scotland\"...by the superintendence of an Honorary Committee of residents in each locality, who on their part undertake to collect locally what amount they are able of Donations towards the first Cost, and of Annual Contributions towards the permanent expenses of their several Establishments.\nIn response, Capt. MacDonald, Commander of H.M. Coastguard, Banff, had written to the RNLI, and his letter and response was discussed at a meeting of the Banff Harbour Trustees in Dec 1859. By January 1860, generous funds and donations were already forthcoming, amounting to £100, and the RNLI agreed to provide a lifeboat, which arrived at the end of August 1860.\nThe first lifeboat station was built at Banff Harbour, and according to the Banffshire Journal and General Advertiser of 4 September 1860, is noted as being a substantial granite building, about 40 feet long, and 18 feet wide within the walls, and which cost about £140.\nAt a meeting of the local committee of the Institution in July 1866, it was unanimously agreed that the lifeboat station be moved from Banff Harbour to Palmer Cove on the East side of Banff Bay. Invitations to tender for the work were placed in the local newspaper on 31 July 1866. However, it would be 11 years later, in 1877, prompted by storm damage to the foundations of the 1860 boathouse, that a new boathouse would be constructed at Palmers Cove, next to Banff Bridge. The 1860 boathouse was demolished, with as much material as possible being used for the construction of the new one. During this period, the boat was stored in the grounds of Duff House.\nIn 1902, the station was officially renamed \"Banff & Macduff\", although it appears to have been known by that name in most publications since 1860. But in 1923, the lifeboat was relocated to Whitehills Harbour, with the name changed to Whitehills Lifeboat Station in 1924. \nThe 1877 boathouse was placed for up for sale in December 1924, and was purchased by Banff Town Council for £135. The boathouse still stands, and on the front gable, there are three stones, marked 1877, RN and LBI (Royal National Life Boat Institution). For a while it was used as the Craigmyle tearoom, but is currently a private residence.\nFor later history, please see\n\nWhitehills Lifeboat Station\nMacduff Lifeboat Station\n\n\n== Station locations and names ==\n\n\n== Banff and Macduff lifeboats ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of RNLI stations\nList of former RNLI stations\nRoyal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboats\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMacduff Lifeboat Station\nMacduff Lifeboat Facebook Page.",

He is a recipient of a National Film Award along with multiple international awards. \nHe started with minor role in Hindi television daily soap Astitva...Ek Prem Kahani in 2002, Gomber steadily carved his path, making notable appearances in projects such as the acclaimed legal drama Court (2014) and the romantic drama Sir (2018), where he demonstrated his ability to portray complex characters with depth and nuance. \nNot limited to acting, Gomber ventured into production and founded his production company, Zoo Entertainment Pvt Ltd, in 2014. He brought compelling narratives to life through films like Balekempa (2018) and The Disciple (2020) which garnered recognition and accolades on the global stage. \n\n\n== Career ==\nGomber began his acting journey with a minor role in Zee TV's Hindi soap opera Astitva...Ek Prem Kahani (2002). He continued to make appearances in various projects, including the bilingual short film The Morning Fog in 2006, where he portrayed a weather guide, and the international film Exitz in the following year, albeit receiving negative reviews from both audiences and critics.\nIn 2008, he joined the cast of the British-Indian comedy series Mumbai Calling, helmed by Sanjeev Bhaskar, which was set in the fictional Teknobable call center located in Mumbai. Following this, Gomber played the role of a call center accent trainer in Kunaal Roy Kapur's English language satirical mockumentary film The President Is Coming in 2009. This film delved into the behind-the-scenes chaos surrounding President Bush's visit to India, receiving acclaim from critics. During this period, he also contributed to Vinod Mitra's drama film Meridian Lines, although the film is yet to be released.\nHis breakthrough came in 2014 with his portrayal of a Gujarati defense lawyer in Chaitanya Tamhane multi-lingual legal drama film, Court, alongside Vira Sathidar and Geetanjali Kulkarni.  The film, which explores the intricacies of the Indian legal system through the trial of an aging protest singer accused of encouraging a manhole worker to commit suicide, earned him widespread recognition. Gomber also served as a producer for the film, a role offered to him by Tamhane. Court had its premier at the 71st Venice International Film Festival and was screened at numerous other prestigious international film festivals, including Auteur Film Festival Serbia, the Washington DC South Asian Film Festival, Minsk International Film Festival, Singapore International Film Festival, International Antalya Film Festival, BFI London Film Festival, Vienna International Film Festival and Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema.

Gomber's performance as Vinay was lauded, Suhani Singh of India Today noted, \"Gomber demonstrates the frustrations and challenges of a helpless lawyer struggling to help his client and let truth win. His Vinay comes closest to voicing the audience's viewpoint of the case.\" The film received several awards, including Best Feature Film at the 62nd National Film Awards. In the same year, Gomber appeared in the American biographical drama The Letters, based on the life of Albanian-Indian Catholic nun Mother Teresa.\nIn 2018, Gomber took on a leading role opposite Tillotama Shome in romantic drama film, Sir.

Alongside his acting endeavors, Gomber produced the Kannada drama film Balekempa, a poignant tale exploring the intricacies of a bangle seller's relationship with his wife. Garnering numerous nominations worldwide, the film earned the FIPRESCI Prize at the Rotterdam International Film Festival. \nNext in 2020, he appeared in Mira Nair's British television drama A Suitable Boy, set against the backdrop of independent India. Critic Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV praised his portrayal, noting, \"Gomber is delightfully on the ball as Arun Mehra\" Also in 2020, he teamed up with Tamhane once again, this time as a producer for the Marathi drama film The Disciple. This film made history by entering the main competition section at the 77th Venice International Film Festival, marking the first Indian film since Monsoon Wedding (2001) to compete at the prestigious event. It went on to win the FIPRESCI International Critics Prize and received accolades at the Toronto International Film Festival, Independent Spirit Awards and Asian Film Awards.

Gomber portrayed an illicit businessman of Indian origin, stationed at the Mogadishu port. Selected after six months of rigorous auditioning and look tests, Gomber's performance was highly acclaimed. Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express praised his portrayal as entertaining, stating, \"Gomber goes full-tilt camp at his Gandhi, yelling-shouting-chain-smoking,\" Ronak Kotecha of The Times of India hailed his character as the undisputed don of Somalia, adding, \"Gomber stands out as Vikrant Gandhi - a recklessly confident character that is created with finesse and indulgence. This bad boy demands your attention and whether you like him or hate him, you cannot ignore him. That’s mainly because Gomber makes it his own.\"\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Films ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n=== Web series ===\n\n\n=== Producer ===\n\n\n=== Play ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVivek Gomber at IMDb\nVivek Gomber at Bollywood Hungama",

        "content": "The Third Republic Movement (Polish: Ruch Trzeciej Rzeczypospolitej, RTR, self-styled as R III R) was a minor conservative political party in Poland functioning between 1992 and 1995, when it united with the Movement for the Republic to form the Movement for the Reconstruction of Poland.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Country Defence Committees ===\nThe Movement was founded by Minister of Defence Jan Parys in April 1992, based on \"Country Defence Committees\" (Polish: Komitety Obrony Państwa), following a meeting with the Polish General Staff, during an ongoing conflict between Parys and President Lech Wałęsa, whom Parys accused of attempting to manipulate the Polish military. During a meeting of the Congress of National Solidarity on April 30 1992, it referred to the Macierewicz List, a product of lustration in Poland, as a \"list of disgraced nationals\". On May 2 1992, the Movement petitioned Prime Minister Jan Olszewski to oppose Wałęsa's plans of strengthening the role of the presidency in Poland.\n\n\n=== Third Republic Movement ===\nThe Movement was formally registered on August 7 1992, during the organization's 2nd Congress. Therein, it drafted the party's political manifesto, and adapted six resolutions.: \n\nrecognizing the removal of Olszewski's cabinet as bordering on being a coup d'etat\ncalling for the immediate resignation or removal of Lech Wałęsa from the presidency\ncalling for the Senate to condemn the functioning of the Sejm, and to investigate whether its actions are constitutional\ndemanding for the decommunisation of the means of mass communication, especially Polish national television and the Polish Press Agency\ncalling for the revealing of the list of all Security Office and Security Service agents since 1944\ndemanding early parliamentary and presidential elections\n\nOn August 10 1992, it adopted a \"Declaration of Cooperation\" with FChD, ChD-SP, PPN and ChD FL. The parties organized press conferences and street demonstrations. A 3rd Congress of the Movement was held on June 12 1993. For the 1993 Polish parliamentary election, it started under Lech and Jarosław Kaczyński's Centre Agreement – Polish Union coalition, which got 4.42% of valid votes failed to cross the electoral threshold. Parys briefly considered running for president in 1995, but endorsed Jan Olszewski instead.\nOn November 11, 1995, RTR united with Olszewski's Movement for the Republic to form the Movement for the Reconstruction of Poland.\n\n\n== Ideology ==\nThe Movement was radically anti-communist, supporting lustration, decommunisation, disenfranchising all Polish citizens involved with the communist Security Service or communist-era nomenklatura.\nEconomically, it supported free market economics, private ownership, privatization and integration with the European Union. It praised the economic reforms of Margaret Thatcher. In terms of foreign policy, it supported the creation of a strong army and joining NATO, encouraging caution against Russia, denying the notion of a third way or compromise between the \"western\" and \"eastern\" spheres. It called for closer cooperation with Poland's neighbours – especially Slovakia, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Ukraine.\nTo achieve its goals, the Movement sought to create a united front of rightwing political parties, consisting of the Movement itself, Real Politics Union, Centre Agreement, Movement for the Republic, National Christian Movement \"Polish Action\", National Party, Christian National Union, Peasants' Agreement and Labour Party.\nIt based itself on \"rightwing-conservative\" ideals, which it described as:\n\nPolish indepdendence\nChristian morality\nPrivate ownership\nFree market economy\nEquality under the law\nIndividual personal freedoms\nDemocratic electoral rules\nAcknowledging the role of the family and the need for a country with strong, but not absolute, powers\n\n\n== Leadership ==\nThe Movement was divided into several bodies: the Presidium of Management, Supreme Committee, Revisional Commission and Disciplinary Court.\nThe Presidium of Management consisted of chairman Jan Parys, vice-chairmen Tadeusz Stański and Waldemar Pernach, secretary Marian Bąkowski and treasurer Jan Laskowski.\n\n\n== Electoral results ==\n\n\n=== Sejm ===\n\n\n=== Presidential ===\n\n\n== References ==",

Professor at the McGill Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences department in Montreal, Québec, he specialized in radar meteorology, a field where he has made important contributions.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nZawadzki was born in Warsaw , Poland on February 9, 1939, just before the outbreak of World War II. Fleeing anti-Semitism and war, his mother took refuge with him in the USSR, then in Argentina. It was in this country that he received a degree in physics from the University of Buenos Aires in 1963. He then specialized in radar meteorology by completing a master's degree (M.Sc. 1968) and a doctorate (PhD. 1972) at McGill University in Montreal.\nAfter his studies, he was first a professor at the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQÀM) during the 1970s where he became director of studies in atmospheric sciences from 1971 to 1982, then director of the physics department. from 1988 to 1992. He then became a professor at McGill University until the end of the 2000s. At this university, he served as the director of the J. S. Marshall Radar Observatory, where he supervised several students who published important papers.\nZawadzki retired in 2010 but continued to serve as professor emeritus. He specializes in weather radar, cloud physics and nowcasting. He died at age 84 on February 11, 2023, after suffering a second cerebrovascular accident (CVA).\n\n\n== Notoriety and awards ==\nIsztar Zawadzki is the author or co-author of more than 117 articles covering a wide range of applications of weather radar data and cloud physics, including improving understanding of the formation processes and distribution of precipitation during winter and summer such as the growth of drops, icing of snowflakes, etc...\nAt the national and international level, Zawadzki was director of the Cooperative Research Center in Mesometeorology (McGill-UQAM-MSC) and senior scientist of the Canadian Meteorological Research Program (Environment and Climate Change Canada). Doctor Zawadzki received:\n\n1991, Patterson Medal for outstanding contribution to meteorology in Canada,\n1998 Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society President's Award,\n2001, Fellow of the Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society,\n2004, Fellow of the American Meteorological Society (AMS),\n2007, Remote Sensing Prize of the AMS,\n2007, member of the Royal Society of Canada.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\"Isztar Zawadzki- Licenciado en Cs.Fisicas UBA.Instalacion de un Radar en Bernardo de Irigoyen\" (in Spanish).

        "content": "Community First New Westminster (CFNW) is a municipal political party in the Canadian city of New Westminster, British Columbia. They were founded in 2022 in preparation for the 2022 British Columbia municipal elections. They are led by Patrick Johnstone, the current mayor of New Westminster. They are affiliated with the New Democratic Party, a Canadian centre-left political party.\n\n\n== History ==\nFor most of New Westminster's history, there were no municipal political parties. However, this changed in 2018 when members of the community created the New West Progressives party, who opposed the incumbent mayor, Jonathan X. Côte, and his allies in city council and the school board. In light of this new opposition, an informal political alliance was formed by Côte with other like-minded candidates, including Patrick Johnstone, Chuck Puchmayr, and Jaimie McEvoy, which came to be known as Team Cote.\nIn December 2021, most members of Team Cote decided to formalize their alliance and became a registered political party with Elections BC, and were founded as the Together New West Electors Society. Later that month, they renamed themselves as Forward New West, before being renamed once again in 2022 to its current name. Côte decided against running for re-election for the 2022 election, and endorsed Patrick Johnstone, who went on to win the party's mayoral nomination prior to the election. Despite being a member of the New Democratic Party, Chuck Puchmayr did not join Community First with many of his colleagues, and decided to run for mayor as an independent, citing a preference for non-partisan politics in New Westminster.\nIn their first election, Community First would win the mayoral election, and achieved majorities in both city council and the school board.\nIn 2023, the party was involved in a controversy surrounding Dee Beattie, a Community First member of the school board. In the summer of 2023, Beattie was caught using a fake twitter account to inappropriately reply to users who were critical of the her work on the school board. Following the allegations, and an eventual apology from Beattie, the party cut ties with her. Beattie resigned from the school board on 26 September 2023.\n\n\n== Election results ==\n\n\n=== General elections ===\n\n\n=== By-elections ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "The New West Progressives (NWP) are a municipal political party in New Westminster, a city in British Columbia, Canada. Despite the 'progressive' name, they maintain a more conservative platform, and were formed to oppose the social democratic municipal government of the late 2010s. The party does not have any formal affiliations with other political parties at the municipal, provincial, or federal level. They were the first municipal political party to be formed in New Westminster. \n\n\n== History ==\nThe New West Progressives were founded in 2017 as the New Westminster Progressive Electors Coalition, in preparation for the 2018 British Columbia municipal elections. The party was formed in response to a perceived lack of ideological diversity in city council, as the mayor and every councillor elected for the 2014–2018 term shared similar beliefs, and were all endorsed by the New Westminster and District Labour Council, an affiliate of the Canadian Labour Congress.\nDuring their campaign, the party was criticized for using terminology and an orange colour scheme more commonly associated with left-wing politics in Canada, and were accused by members of the community for trying to trick voters into voting for a more conservative platform. In the party's first election, they did not nominate a candidate for the mayoral election, and instead focused on the city council and school board elections. In their first election, their top candidate for city council, Daniel Fontaine, received 5,297 votes, but ultimately finished seventh and was not elected. Danielle Connelly, a NWP candidate for the school board, placed sixth in the election after receiving 5,626 votes, and became the first member of the party to hold an elected position in New Westminster.\nPrior to the 2022 general election, the party began a stronger campaign and nominated a mayoral candidate, Ken Armstrong, for the first time. They also switched their campaign colours from orange to green and purple. Unlike 2018, the NWP were no longer the only political party in New Westminster, following the establishment of the Community First New West political party by several of the social democratic candidates, many of which were incumbent councillors and school board trustees. The New West Progressives were ultimately unsuccessful in the mayoral election, with Armstrong losing to Patrick Johnstone by 1,449 votes. However, they were able to elect two candidates as city councillors, with Paul Minhas and Daniel Fontaine placing fifth and sixth respectively. Fontaine's electoral victory made him the first known Métis and Indigenous member of the New Westminster City Council. Connelly retained her seat as the sole NWP party member on the school board.\n\n\n== Election results ==\n\n\n=== General elections ===\n\n\n=== By-elections ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Coordinated Lunar Time or LTC is a proposed primary lunar time standard for the Moon. In early April 2024, NASA was asked by the White House to work alongside domestic and international agencies for the purpose of establishing a unified standard time for the Moon and other celestial bodies by 2026. The White House's request, led by the Office of Science and Technology Policy, called for a \"Coordinated Lunar Time\", which was first proposed by the European Space Agency in early 2023.Currently, the time on the Moon is different for each country involved. As a result, activities on the Moon are coordinated using the time zone of where a mission's headquarters is based. For example, the Apollo missions utilized the Central Time Zone (CDT) as the missions were controlled from Houston, Texas.\n\n\n== History ==\nAs part of an ongoing global billionaire space race and a wider international space race between the United States and China, a need exists for a universal time-keeping benchmark so that lunar spacecraft and satellites are able to fulfill their respective missions with precision and accuracy. Due to differences in gravitational force and other factors, time passes fractionally faster on the Moon when observed from Earth.Under the Artemis program, and supported by the Commercial Lunar Payload Services missions, astronauts and a proposed scientific \"Moonbase\" are envisioned to take place on and around the lunar surface from the 2020s onwards. The proposed standard would therefore solve a current timekeeping issue. According to OSTP Chief Arati Prabhakar, currently, time would \"appear to lose on average 58.7 microseconds per Earth-day and come with other periodic variations that would further drift moon time from Earth time\".The development of the standard is set to be a collaborative effort, initially amongst members of the Artemis Accords, but will be meant to apply globally. The initial proposal of the standard calls for four key features:\ntraceability back to Coordinated Universal Time,\naccuracy sufficient for navigation and science,\nresilience to disruptions, and\nscalability to potential environments beyond cislunar space.LunaNet, an upcoming lunar communications and navigation service under development with the European Space Agency, calls for a Lunar Time System Standard which the LTC is meant to address.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTimekeeping on Mars\nCoordinated Universal Time\nLunaNet\nExploration of the Moon\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCelestial Time Standardization Memo",

In 1971 she was convicted of second-degree conspiracy for attempting to firebomb a bank in New York City as part of a Weather Underground plot.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nIn 1964, Sharon travelled to Cuba with her husband Allen Krebs and their son Thorsten, despite a government travel ban. This resulted in their passports (including that of their five-year-old son) being withdrawn upon their return to JFK Airport. It also caused Allen to lose his teaching position at Adelphi University. Consequently, Sharon and her husband established the Free University of New York in 1965 where she taught Russian literature.\nAfter her divorce from Allen Krebs, Sharon was in a long-term relationship with Robin Palmer, though they never married. Palmer was a member of the Weather Underground and a prolific political activist.\nIn September 1966, Sharon Krebs was arrested for obstructing the sidewalk on Second Avenue in New York City, where she had set up a table without a peddler's licence in order to sell literature and pins expressing support for the Viet Cong. In September 1967 the charges were dismissed.\nSharon Krebs was fined $50 for engaging in disorderly conduct during the 1968 Columbia University protests. In July 1968, Krebs and 35 others were arrested and charged for incitement to rioting at an Anti-Vietnam War rally, which targeted a fundraising dinner for Vice President Hubert Humphrey. In November 1968, Krebs and her partner Robin Palmer disrupted a Humphrey-Muskie campaign rally by stripping nude and holding up a severed pig's head; a signature move of the radical group known as \"the Crazies\", whose members were often associated with the Youth International Party or \"Yippies\".\nKrebs joined the staff of the underground newspaper RAT in 1969. Around the same time, she helped to establish the feminist guerrilla theater group known as the Women's International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell (W.I.T.C.H) with Nancy Kurshan, Robin Morgan and Roz Payne.\n\n\n=== Arson trial ===\n\nOn December 4, 1970, Sharon Krebs was arrested along with five others (Robin Palmer, Joyce Plecha, Claudia Conine, Martin Lewis and Christopher Trenkle) while attempting to carry out the first in a series of planned arson attacks on buildings in New York City. The date of the intended firebombing was chosen as it was the one year anniversary of the killing of Fred Hampton by police in Chicago. The planned targets included 20 Broad Street, which housed the law firm Mudge Rose Guthrie & Alexander (of which Richard Nixon was previously a partner); East Fifth Street police station; a new police station under construction off West Tenth Street; the Bolivian Consulate; the mathematics and science building at New York University; and the First National City Bank at Madison Avenue and 91st Street, where Krebs and the others were caught placing four 1-gallon containers of gasoline and benzene, and were subsequently arrested.\nPolice were able to foil the attacks as the conspirators had been under surveillance for months, and were trailed by undercover police informant Steve Weiner.  Krebs's apartment at 90 Bedford Street in Greenwich Village was raided by police, who recovered multiple items including Viet Cong flags; this building would later become famous for its use in establishing shots in the sitcom Friends.\nKrebs was described by her lawyer as a 33‐year‐old divorcee with a 12‐year‐old child, working as a freelance copy editor who had recently completed work for Random House. All of the conspirators pleaded not guilty at their arraignment and denied being members of the Weather Underground, but were nonetheless identified as such by police. On March 8, 1971 - the day before their trial was due to start - all of the defendants pleaded guilty to second-degree conspiracy and Krebs was sentenced to a maximum of 4 years in prison. She was incarcerated at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility until her release on November 10, 1972.\n\n\n=== Later life ===\nAfter serving her prison sentence, Sharon's relationship with Robin Palmer broke down and they separated. She mothered three more children in the years after her release from prison.\nIn mid-1988 she was interviewed by Joshua Melville, son of Sam Melville, after whom she had named her daughter Samantha. By this point she had remarried and adopted a new surname, and was living in Brooklyn Heights working part-time in a civil litigation firm.\nSharon Krebs died from cancer in 2008.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\nSharon Krebs was cast as Jane in the 1975 drama film Milestones.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPhotograph of Sharon Krebs, Claudia Conine and Joyce Plecha after their arrest in New York (1970)\nSDS publication \"A History of the Cuban Revolution: 1868-1959\" by Sharon Krebs",

He also treated the subject in a 1621-1625 work now in the Gallerie nazionali d'arte antica in palazzo Barberini, Rome.\nIts treatment of colour is influenced by Jusepe de Ribera and its pyramidal composition is heavily influenced by the Pietà by Annibale Carracci. Some accounts state that Ribera, who was producing a work on the same subject for the Certosa's sacristy, became so afraid that Stanzione's work would overshadow his that he suggested adding a compound of his own making to it to make its colours brighter. This compound in fact damaged Stanzione's pigments but Stanzione refused the monks' request to restore the work. \n\n\n== References ==",

This holotype is now at the British Museum.\nIt was initially described by Colin Harrison and Cyril A. Walker in 1976, and placed in the family phalacrocoracidae. It was placed in class Aves incertae sedis by Jiří Mlíkovský in 2002.\nA similar sample was found in the Late Eocene-early Oligocene Jebel Qatrani Formation in Faiyum, Egypt, but whether this sample represents P. tenuirostris, another Piscator species, or a different phalacrocoracid is unknown.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nP. tenuirostris is the oldest discovered cormorant-like bird in the fossil record. It is the type specimen of its genus, and the only species of Piscator currently described. Other samples, including some in private collections, represent prehistoric phalacrocoracids, but have not been described to more specific classifications.\n\n\n== See also ==\nValenticarbo\nList of fossil bird genera\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Richard Anthony Stafford (1801 – 15 January 1854) was an English surgeon.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nStafford was third son of Egerton Stafford, rector of Chalcombe and of Thenford in Northamptonshire, was born at Cropredy, Oxfordshire, in 1801. Through his mother he was one of the next of kin to William of Wykeham. Stafford was educated privately, and was then apprenticed to two noted practitioners of Cirencester, Lawrence and Warner, the former being father of the great surgeon, Sir William Lawrence. He came to London in 1820, and entered St. Bartholomew's Hospital. Here he soon attracted the notice of John Abernethy, who appointed him his house-surgeon for 1823–4. He was admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1824. He then went abroad and spent a year in Paris. He returned to London in 1826, and commenced to practise as a surgeon. The Jacksonian prize was awarded to him in this year for his essay ‘On Spina Bifida, and Injuries and Diseases of the Spine and the Medulla Spinalis.’ He was elected senior surgeon to the St. Marylebone infirmary in 1831, and was subsequently appointed surgeon-extraordinary to H.R.H. the duke of Cambridge. At the Royal College of Surgeons of England he was elected one of the first fellows in 1843, and he was made a member of its council in 1848, though he was soon obliged to retire on account of ill-health. He was elected Hunterian orator for 1851, and prepared an oration which was printed in the same year. He was too ill to deliver it, and he died unmarried on 15 January 1854, at 28 Old Burlington Street.\nThere is a half-length portrait of Stafford, painted by William Salter and engraved by John Cochran. A copy of the engraving is prefixed to Pettigrew's memoir.\nStafford was a skilful surgeon, whose work was always conducted upon the legitimate basis of an accurate anatomical knowledge. He was a voluminous writer upon subjects of professional interest. He published \n\n‘A Series of Observations on Strictures of the Urethra,’ London, 8vo, 1828.\n‘Further Observations on Lancetted Stylettes,’ London, 8vo, 1829; 3rd edit. 1836.\n‘A Treatise on Injuries … of the Spine, founded on the Jacksonian Prize Essay for 1826,’ London, 8vo, 1832.\n‘On Perforation of Strictures of the Urethra,’ London, 8vo, 1834.\n‘An Essay on the Treatment of some Affections of the Prostate Gland,’ London, 8vo, 1840; 2nd edit. 1845.\n‘On Treatment of Hæmorrhoids,’ 8vo, 1853.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Henderson, Thomas Finlayson (1886). \"Stafford, Richard Anthony\".

She leads the organisation that gathers the data necessary to check whether there has been a test of a nuclear explosive as part of nuclear non-proliferation oversight for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization in Vienna.\n\n\n== Life ==\nSouley was born in 1964 and she gained her first degree at the University of Setif in Algeria. She studied for a post-graduate degree in optical and microwave communications at Limoges University and she was awarded her applied physics doctorate from the University of Paris13.\nIn 2011 she began a decade of lecturing at Abdou Moumouni University in Niamey. In 2014 she became the chairperson of the High Authority for Atomic Energy of Niger. Her organisation operated stations that detected nuclear explosive testing in Niger. Niger established its own Nuclear regulatory authority and passed an all encompassing nuclear law.\nIn 2018 she was involved in a Women and Science events in Niger where prizes were awarded. Present were the first lady Hadjia Aïssata Issoufou Mahamadou, Kadi Alzouma and Djamila Ferdjani.\nIn 2018 it was recognised that Niger was in the early stages of starting a nuclear energy programme, but at the government's invitation, the International Atomic Energy Agency delivered a report evaluating Niger's progress against 19 issues to the Minister of Energy Amina Moumouni. Souley was present as President of the High Authority for Atomic Energy of Niger.\nShe left the High Authority for Atomic Energy of Niger in 2021 and in March 2021 she became the Director of the International Data Centre at the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test Ban Treaty Organization in Vienna.\nIn 2022 she visited American expert organisations. She went to Germantown in Maryland to see the company that supplies the data network before visiting a company in Chantilly, Virginia who operate eleven monitoring stations that use a number of complementary detectors including seismic and the sensing of radionuclides.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "J.P. Bimeni (né Jean Patrick Bimenyimana Serukamba; born December, 1976) is an English-Burundian singer, songwriter, and musician.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJ.P. Bimeni was born on December, 1976, in Burundian capital Bujumbura. His father was a Tutsi military and his mother was a descendant of the royal family. His parents got divorced and his mother raised alone Bimeni and his three borthers. Bimeni was sent in a covent's school in the countryside. I played basketball with Hutus, I shared a dormitory with them [...]. I had no real idea of the difference between me and them until 1993.\nIn October 1993, he was 15 at the start of the Burundian Civil War. He survived a massacre at his school; he was shot in the chest and at the hospital he was given medication that caused a dangerous reaction in his body and he lost half his body weight. He airlifted in Nairobi's hospital. \n\nI was lying in a hospital bed in Kenya, watching maggots and pus coming out of my chest drain. [...]. I'd been told I wouldn't survive the gunshot wound I'd sustained in Burundi; a priest even came to read me my last rights.\nHe registered as a refugee and applied for a scholarship program run by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. In 1996, he earned a scholarship at Atlantic College in Wales and spoke little English. He earned an International Baccalaureate in Oxford and a degree in politics from the University of Central Lancashire in Preston. \nIn 2001, Bimeni moved to London. When he was a child, he wanted to be a performer. \"I'd choreograph Michael Jackson dances with my friends.\" While in Wales for the first time. he bought some records from the singers Ray Charles, Otis Redding, Bob Marley and Marvin Gaye. He learned to play guitar alone and begun to sing his songs and played jam sessions with Roots Manuva's band and Shingai Shoniwa.\n\n\n== Career ==\nDuring several years, he performed with different bands: Mantilla covered Sam & Dave, Jezebel Sextet covered Otis Redding.\nIn 2017, he sang with a funk group, Speedometer in Spain. The Tucxone Records label spotted Bimeni and offered him a chance to tour with the Spanish band the Black Belts. In 2018, the album Free Me was released. To Craig Charles from BBC Radio 6 Music, \"very few people have a soul story to compare and from all the trauma has emerged one of the very best soul voices we’ve heard for a very long time.\" To Radio France Bimeni's voice recalling tones of Otis Redding and Marvin Gay and surnamed him the Burundian Otis Redding. This album with classic 60s-sounding, Motown and Stax inspired grooves, the album was written by musical director Eduardo Martínez and songwriter Marc Ibarz and Bimeni imbued these tales with his tragic experiences making ‘Free Me’ a deep soul soundtrack to his life: \"When I sing I feel like I’m cleansing myself: music is a way for me to forget.\"\nIn 2022, the second Give Me Hope was released and he paid tribute to James Stern and Martin Luther King.\nIn 2021, Bimeni returned to Burundi for the first time in 10 years. He performed for the first time in Rwanda in 2023 under his child alias Mudibu. \nIn 2024, Bimeni shared a duet with Moby on his new album Always Centered at Night with the title Should Sleep. He declared :\n\nIt is surreal for me, as I think about the journey I am on, have been on and am now working with Moby (internal scream, over the moon). I feel that through this work, there’s simple wisdom, warmth, healing, uplift, breath and steadfastness.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nFree Me (2018)\nGive Me Hope (2022)\n\n\n=== Collaboration ===\n\"Should Sleep\" with Moby (2023)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Yuri Dzitssuty (Russian: Юрий Дзиццойты, also spelled Yury Dziztssoi), also known by his patronymic, Yuri Albertovich, is an Ossetian politician from the partially recognized Caucasian Republic of South Ossetia, which most of the UN recognizes as part of Georgia, occupied by Russia.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPrior to entering politics, in the 1970s Dzitssuty worked as a professor of Philology at the South Ossetian State Pedagogical Institute recounting how in 1979 he, and Ossetian linguist Zamira Tshovrebova, attempted to publish a book on Ossetian grammar, which he claimed Georgian officials attempted to block the publication and distribution of.\n\n\n=== Political career ===\nDzitssuty's political career started when he was elected in the 1990 South Ossetian Supreme Soviet election, the event which triggered the beginning of the South Ossetia war, stating he ran as an Ossetian nationalist due to efforts by Georgia to erase the Ossetian language. In 1991, during the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, Dzitssuty headed the \"Central Commission for the Referendum on the preservation of the USSR\" and also organized the 1992 South Ossetian independence referendum.\nDzitssuty has been elected to the Parliament of South Ossetia three times, which, of the 221 people who have served as MPs, only six others have also been elected thrice. In 2005, as vice-speaker of Parliament, Dzitssuty criticized the European Union's allocation of relief funds, stating that over 70% of the funds set aside for Transcaucasia have been spent in Georgia, and that the only project the EU worked on in South Ossetia was the reconstruction of a school in Java In 2008 Dzitssuty was part of a state visit to Chechnya, alongside Minister of Health, Nugzar Gabaraev, and Commissioner for Human rights, David Sanakoev, where he stated that he hoped South Ossetia would be integrated into Russia, like Chechnya had been, sometime in the near future.\nIn 2012, as vice-speaker of Parliament, Dzitssuty attended the inaugural congress of the new political party Ossetia - Liberty Square, congratulating the party and its founder, Alla Dzhioeva. Since 2012 Dzitssuty has led a concerted effort to replace the use of the Russian language in South Ossetia with the Ossetian language, an effort which was promoted by then President Leonid Tibilov. Dzitssuty led the Parliamentary Commission for the Preservation and Development of the Ossetian Language which mandated the translation of newspapers, radio, television, and magazines into Ossetian. The commission also sought to create new Ossetian words to end the use of predominately Russian and English loanwords, mostly on technological matters.\nDzitssuty attempted to register for the 2012 South Ossetian presidential election, being the first candidate to pass the Ossetian language proficiency test, and to collect 500 signatures. However, his candidacy would be rejected by the Central Election Commission (CEC) due to \"irregularities\" in the signatures he collected.\nIn 2014 Dzitssuty served as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Policy and Interparliamentary Relations, where he worked on formalizing a legal framework to assess Georgian \"aggression\" from 2004 to 2008.\nIn 2024 Dzitssuty became the spokesmen for the new political party Iron, founded by Georgiy Kabisov.\n\n\n=== Philologic advocacy ===\nIn 2014, Dzitssuty gave an interview to Radio Free Europe outlining the progress that the government has taken to codifying and promoting the use of the Ossetian language, comparing it to the Czech National Revival. In 2017 Dzitssuty was congratulated by then President Anatoly Bibilov for his contributions to Ossetian philology, namely his 1979 book.\nIn 2021 Dzitssuty called for more government involvement in the revival of Ossetian, stating that his project does not have the necessary scientists and resources to effectively implement the changes from a Slavic to Iranian language in the country, namely, that the people who can speak Ossetian are mostly from rural regions, and are illiterate let alone devoid of a technical and scientific background. He also called on the South Ossetian government to make the revival of the Ossetian language its \"scientific priority.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Harry Sharples (c. 1862 – ?) was an association footballer who played for Blackburn Rovers in the 1882 FA Cup final.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSharples was born in Blackburn in Lancashire in 1861 or 1862, and started playing for Rovers in the 1880–81 season; in common with a lot of players for the Rovers, he had an easy job through which he was paid a disguised wage - Sharples was the son of a cotton manufacturer, and he had been made a cotton mill manager while still a teenager.\nHe made his FA Cup debut for Rovers in the club's 6–2 first round win over Bolton Wanderers in 1881–82, as a half-back, and he scored the Rovers' final goal.  He was not however a regular player - he did not make another appearance in the Cup until the semi-final replay win against Sheffield Wednesday, as a late replacement for \"Dock\" Greenwood, who had been injured playing for England.  Greenwood had hoped to be fit for the final, but he failed a last-minute test, and Sharples deputed again.\nSharples' last appearance in the competition was in the 11–1 win over Blackpool in the first round of the 1882–83 FA Cup.  Almost straight after the match Sharples emigrated to New Zealand, which put an end to a promising career; although he returned after 12 months he does not seem to have taken the game up again.\n\n\n== References and notes ==",

        "content": "Nono Monzuluku (born Honoré Monzuluku Mombele; January 1, 1960 – January 10, 2024) was a Congolese composer and musician. He made significant contributions to Congolese music, particularly through his role as an animateur (atalaku) in the influential band Zaïko Langa Langa.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\n\n\n=== Early life and musical beginnings ===\nMombele was born on January 1, 1960, in Léopoldville (now Kinshasa), in what was then the Belgian Congo (and was later the Republic of the Congo, then Zaire, and is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo). His musical journey began as a member of the folk group Bana Odéon, which included members such as Ditutala Mbuesa, Bébé Atalaku and Djerba Mandjeku (congas).\nHowever, he gained widespread recognition after joining Zaïko Langa Langa, one of the most influential bands in African music history, in August 1982, alongside his colleagues Bébé Atalaku and Djerba Mandjeku. Alongside his colleagues Bébé Atalaku and Djerba Mandjeku, Mombele played a pivotal role in shaping the sound of Zaïko.\n\n\n=== Innovation ===\nNono Monzuluku Mombele made history as the first animateur (atalaku) in modern Congolese music, pioneering the role alongside Bébé Atalaku. Atalakus sing during the sebene section of a Congolese rumba song, providing energetic chants often imbued with significations or morals, while playing percussions such as shakers (before 1982, small animations were performed by the vocalists of a band). Mombele and his contemporaries introduced innovative chants and percussive elements during this section, adding depth and energy to Zaïko Langa Langa's performances.\n\n\n=== Later career ===\nMombele's tenure with Zaïko Langa Langa spanned over three decades, during which he participated in numerous albums and toured all around the world. Notable albums featuring Mombele include \"Zekete Zekete 2e Episode,\" \"Nippon Banzai,\" \"Jetez l'éponge,\" and \"Avis de Recherche.\" He left the band in 2008 and then settled in Paris.\nNono Monzuluku embarked on a solo venture in October 2021 with the release of his first and only single, \"Mosisa\", a 25-minute medley containing a big part of his animations. It is the longest \"générique\" recorded by a Congolese artist.\n\n\n== Death ==\nNono Monzuluku passed away on January 10, 2024, in Le Blanc-Mesnil, France, due to previous health complications that caused hypertension. Three months later, his body was repatriated and buried in Kinshasa.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nHis contributions helped boost the popularity of the Atalakus within Congolese bands (leading to the apparition of other atalakus such as Djuna Mumbafu, Roberto Ekokota, Bill Clinton Kalonji...) and also throughout Africa. A notable example is DJ Arafat in Ivory Coast, who gained wide recognition as an atalaku.\n\n\n== References ==",

Remains were found in the Bracklesham Group in Hordle, England, which dates to the Priabonian, the last age of the Eocene epoch.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe genus was introduced by Cyril A. Walker and Colin Harrison in 1976. It was placed in class Aves incertae sedis by Jiří Mlíkovský in 2002. The word piscator is Latin for \"fisherman.\"\nThe type species, Piscator tenuirostris, is the oldest cormorant-like bird found in the fossil record. Other fossils may also represent species in this genus, but they have not been described as such, with some residing in private collections.\n\n\n== See also ==\nValenticarbo\nList of fossil bird genera\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "John Stevenson (1778–1846?) was an English surgeon.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nStevenson was the son of Joseph and Deborah Stevenson. He was baptised at Kegworth on the borders of Leicestershire and Derbyshire, on 13 March 1778. He was educated privately, and was apprenticed to his father, a surgeon, at the age of sixteen. Three years later he was sent to the united hospitals (St. Thomas's and Guy's) in the Borough, where he stayed until 1800. It is probable that his medical studies were much interrupted by ill-health, for he was not admitted a member of the College of Surgeons of England until 20 November 1807. On account of his ill-health he determined to devote himself to the ophthalmic side of surgery. After studying for some time under John Cunningham Saunders, the oculist, he settled in or near Nottingham. The death of Saunders in 1810 led Stevenson to return to London, where he commenced to practise.\nIn 1813 he was oculist and aurist to the Princess of Wales, and to Leopold, duke of Saxe-Coburg; he was then living in Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury. He delivered the anniversary oration at the Medical Society of London in March 1817, taking as his subject the treatment of gutta serena. He founded in 1830, at 13 Little Portland Street, Cavendish Square, ‘The Royal Infirmary for Cataract,’ and he was soon afterwards appointed oculist and aurist to William IV. In 1841 he became oculist and aurist to Leopold I, king of the Belgians, and in 1844 he was living in Conduit Street and at Norwood Park, Middlesex. All trace of him is lost after this year.\nStevenson undertook to operate upon cases of cataract at an earlier period than was thought advisable by other surgeons, and his infirmary was founded with the express design of carrying out his mode of treatment.\nHis works are:\n\n‘On the Morbid Sensibility of the Eye, commonly called Weakness of Sight,’ London, 1810, 8vo; reprinted at Hartford, America, 1815; 3rd edit., London, 1819; 4th edit. 1841.\n‘A Practical Treatise on Cataract,’ London 1813, 8vo; 2nd edit. 1814; a new edit. 1824, and again in 1834; 5th edit. 1839, 12mo; 7th edit. 1843.\n‘On the Nature of … Gutta Serena,’ London, 1821, 8vo; an expansion of his anniversary address delivered at the Medical Society in 1817.\n‘Deafness, its Causes, Prevention, and Cure,’ London 1828, 8vo; 7th edit. 1842.\n‘On Throat Deafness,’ London, 12mo; 4th edit. 1843.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Power, D'Arcy (1898). \"Stevenson, John (1778-1846?)\".

        "content": "Robert Taylor FRS (April 1710 – 15 May 1762) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nTaylor was the son of John Taylor of Newark, twice mayor of that town. He was born there in April 1710. He was educated at the Newark grammar school on Dr. Magnus's foundation and under Dr. Warburton; he was entered at St. John's College, Cambridge, but migrated to Trinity College on 27 Oct. 1727. He proceeded M.B. in 1732 and M.D. on 7 July 1737. Returning to Newark in 1732, he won the esteem of his fellow-townsmen by his polished manners, professional assiduity, and general erudition. While practising at Newark he was called in to attend Richard Boyle, third earl of Burlington, who was on a visit to Belvoir Castle, and who was there taken dangerously ill. Taylor cured the patient by (it is said) the bold administration of opium. Thereupon Lord and Lady Burlington prevailed upon him to remove to London, where their efforts soon established him in extensive practice, and obtained for him the patronage of Sir Edward Hulse (1682–1759), who was withdrawing from public life. Taylor was admitted a candidate of the Royal College of Physicians on 4 April 1748, and was elected a fellow on 20 March 1749. He was Gulstonian lecturer in 1750, censor in 1751, and Harveian orator in 1755. His oration, which was published in 1756, summarised the opinion of the College of Physicians with respect to inoculation, and was especially valued in foreign countries. It ranks among the most polished in style and the most elaborate in matter of any of the Harveian orations that are in print.\nTaylor was admitted a fellow of the Royal Society on 7 Dec. 1752. He held the appointment of physician to the king. A fine mansion at Winthorpe, near Newark, which he was erecting, was unfinished at the time of his death. He died on 15 May 1762, and was buried in South Audley Street chapel, whence his remains were removed in 1778 to Winthorpe. He was twice married: first to Anne, youngest daughter of John Heron (she died in 1757, and was buried at Newark); secondly, on 9 November 1759, to Elizabeth Mainwaring of Lincoln, a lady who had a fortune of 10,000l. His only surviving child, Elizabeth, became the wife of Henry Chaplin of Blankney Hall, Lincolnshire. He and his second wife are commemorated by a monument in Winthorpe church. There was a portrait of Taylor at Blankney in the possession of his descendant, the Right Hon. Henry Chaplin, M.P.\nTaylor was the author of:\n‘Epistola Critica ad O.V.D. Edoardum Wilmot, Baronettum; in qua quatuor Quæstionibus ad Variolas Insitivas spectantibus orbi medico denuo propositis ab Antonio de Haen in Univ. Vindobonensi Professore primario, directe responsum est.’\n‘Sex Historiæ Medicæ sive Morborum aliquot funestorum et rariorum Commentarius.’ These, with his Harveian oration of 1755, were published together under the title of ‘Miscellanea Medica,’ 4to, London, 1761.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Webb, William Wilfrid (1898). \"Taylor, Robert (1710-1762)\".

It was preceded by the single \"Creatures in Heaven\", released on 3 April 2024.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe album was partly inspired by the success of \"Heat Waves\" in 2020, with frontman Dave Bayley saying that \"sometimes you aren't able to change as quickly on a personal level\". He explained that success can leave one feeling like a \"spectator\" with accompanying expectations to act a certain way, which \"confused [him] to the point of not knowing who [he] was or if anything was real\". The title is about the power and mystery of human connection in a universe that \"may make us feel overwhelmingly small\". Bayley also explained that the lead single \"Creatures in Heaven\" is about \"a moment in time [...] having the capacity to be enormously formative and life-changing\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

He was the eldest son of John Walsh, a merchant, of Ballymountain House, co. Waterford. Robert Walsh was his younger brother. After early education at Waterford, he studied medicine at Edinburgh and at Glasgow, where he graduated M.D. in 1791. Before leaving Waterford he founded a literary society there, an account of which by him appeared anonymously in the ‘British Magazine,’ 1830 (ii. 99–105). A poem by him gained a prize of a silver medal offered by this society, and on being appropriated some years after by one of the competitors for the Dublin College Historical Society medal was also successful (Brit. Mag. ii. 100). In 1792 Walsh published a poem, ‘The Progress of Despotism: a Poem on the French Revolution,’ which was dedicated to Charles James Fox. In the ‘Anthologia Hibernica’ he published about the same time a proposal for a universal alphabet. While a student in Edinburgh he published several sketches of some merit, one of which (a view of the side of Calton Hill on which a facial resemblance to Nelson could at that time be traced) appeared in ‘Ackerman's Repository.’\nWalsh began his professional career as medical officer on a West Indian packet. He was afterwards physician to the forces in Ireland, being present at the battles in Wexford in 1798, and at the surrender of Humbert at Ballinamuck. He also served in Holland in 1799, and at the attack on Copenhagen (2 April 1801), where his hand was shattered. He was afterwards sent with the 49th regiment to Canada, where he spent some years studying Indian life. He collected a vast amount of information for a statistical history of Canada, but never published the work. He was present during most of the battles in the Peninsular war, and at Waterloo, and also served in the Walcheren expedition. He held for some time the post of president of the medical board at Ostend. He died on 7 February 1832 at Summerhill, Dublin.\nHe published a ‘Narrative of the Expedition to Holland’ (London, 1800, 4to), and a collection of poems entitled ‘Bagatelles’ (1793); and wrote for the ‘Edinburgh Medical Journal,’ the ‘Amulet,’ &c. A portrait of him was painted by John Comerford, and an engraving of it appeared in the ‘Dublin University Magazine’ (1834, vol. iii.).\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: O'Donoghue, David James (1899). \"Walsh, Edward (1756-1832)\".

        "content": "Soledad Real López (1917–2007) was a Catalan communist and anti-fascist activist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSoledad Real López was born in 1917 in Barceloneta; her father had moved to the city to work in La Maquinista Terrestre i Marítima and her mother was an embroiderer. Real was expelled from school at the age of 7, due to her father's involvement in a strike at La Maquinista. By the age of 9, she was already earning a wage as a seamstress, working several jobs at various garment factories into her adulthood.\nFollowing the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic, in 1933, she joined the Communist Youth. The following year, she organised aid for refugees that had fled the repression of the Revolution of 1934. In 1936, she joined the Unified Socialist Youth of Catalonia (Catalan: Joventut Socialista Unificada de Catalunya; JSUC).\nAt the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, she participated in the antifascist mobilisation to resist the July 1936 military uprising in Barcelona, before continuing her political education at the cadre school of Lina Òdena. She was a co-founder of the National Young Women's Alliance (Catalan: Aliança Nacional de la Dona Jove; ANDJ), the women's branch of the JSUC, and was elected to the JSUC's national committee in August 1937. With the advance of the Nationalists' Catalonia Offensive, she helped organise the evacuation of Republicans from Catalonia into France. \nShe was separated from her family and spent some time in French internment camps. In November 1939, a decree by the government of Édouard Daladier forced her, along with fellow JSUC activists Isabel Vicente García and Maria Salvo Iborra, back over the border at Hendaia. In 1940, she returned to Barceloneta and reconstituted local branches of the PSUC, JSUC and International Red Aid (SRI). In August 1941, she was arrested in her house, together with Clara Pueyo Jornet and Isabel Imbert, and imprisoned in the Les Corts Women's Prison. In 1943, she was transferred to the Ventas Women's Prison in Madrid, where she was tried by a military tribunal and sentenced to thirty years in prison.\nAfter 16 years passing through various prisons throughout the country, she was granted conditional release, under prohibition of returning to the province of Barcelona. In Madrid, she returned to activism, first with the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) and later joining the Communist Party of the Peoples of Spain (PCPE).\nIn 1970, she joined the Castilian Association of Housewives and Consumers (Spanish: Associació castellana d'Ames de casa y consumidoras). She was also a member of the Women's Democratic Movement and of the Barcelona Friends of UNESCO. Soledad Real eventually returned to Barcelona, where she died on 6 February 2007.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLes finestres de Soledad Real: Testimoni i homenatge a la \"Sole\" - Communists of Catalonia",

        "content": "Laura Jou i Bonet (born 14 March 1969 in Barcelona) is a Catalan professor of theater and director. She was trained as an actress at the Theater Institute of Barcelona. In the early 2000s, she began working as an advisor for child actors. This role led her to participate in 24 films and 18 series, including The Orphanage, Black Bread, Eva and The Impossible.\nJou is the mother of singer and YouTuber Rojuu.\n\n\n== Life Without Sara Amat ==\nAfter presenting the short film No me quites at the 2016 Gaudí Awards, producer Isona Passola commissioned Jou's first film, Life Without Sara Amat. It was an adaptation of a novel of the same name by Pep Puig, which won the 2015 Premio Sant Jordi, a prize for novels written in the Catalan language. Jou directed the film alongside director of photography Gris Jordana and composer Pau Vallvé.\nTo find her main cast, Jou recruited former acting students of hers that starred in The Red Band Society and Merlí to recruit young actors via Instagram, and \"20,000 children signed up.\" To prepare for their roles, the cast did two months of rehearsal, and became \"a real gang, with real ties.\" They underwent exercises to understand the motivations of their characters and rehearsed scenes that were not in the script.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n2015: No me quites\n2019: Life Without Sara Amat\n\n\n== References ==",

He was capped by the Czechoslovak national speedway team.\n\n\n== Career ==\nLucák was born on 20 July 1912 in Strýčkovice. He began a career connected with racing when he took on an apprenticeship at the Prague company of the Šulc brothers, who imported British motorcycles of the BSA brand. He participated in his first race at the age of 20 at a competition in Tábor. He also raced road racing and speedway. In the 1930s, he was a factory driver for the Ogar company and in 1935 he competed in the Swedish Grand Prix on a Velocette motorcycle. In 1935, he was the first winner of the 300-turn race in Hořice on an Ogar motorcycle in the 250 class.

        "content": "Sahyadriophis uttaraghati is a species of keelback endemic to the northern Western Ghats region of India. It is commonly known as the northern sahyadri keelback.\n\n\n== Description ==\nSahyadriophis uttaraghati has a predominantly brown to dark grey coloration with random black and white markings that become less distinct towards the rear of the body. The underside transitions from white in the front area to cream and yellow towards the rear. Some individuals may feature a light-colored bar on the back of the head and a downwardly directed post-ocular stripe, typically white or lighter in color with black edges.\n\n\n== Range ==\nSahyadriophis uttaraghati appears to be common and widespread in the western ghats region of Maharashtra.\n\n\n== Habitat and ecology ==\nSpecimens were observed actively moving during the day in a dried streambed. The species appears to be largely diurnal and has been observed feeding on Indirana and eggs of Nyctibatrachus.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe specific epithet is a combination of two Sanskrit words: 'uttara' for north and 'ghati' meaning dweller of the mountains/Ghats. The combination refers to the northern distribution of Sahyadriophis uttaraghati.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Stern Hunting Lodge in Potsdam was built between 1730 and 1732 under the reign of the Soldier King Frederick William I in the style of a simple Dutch town house. The contract for the construction was probably awarded to Cornelius van den Bosch, a grenadier and master carpenter from Holland, and the building was supervised by Pierre de Gayette, Captain of the Corps of Engineers and Court Architect.\nAt the time of its construction, the building, which was only designed for hunting trips, stood at the center of an extensive area that had been developed for par force hunts since 1726 with the construction of a star-shaped system of tracks. The area converted for this hunt was given the name Parforceheide. Today, it stands between the 115 highway to the east and a new district built into the Parforceheide from 1970 to 1980 to the west, on the edge of the Potsdam district of Stern. Following the destruction of the city palace, the Stern hunting lodge is now the oldest surviving palace building in Potsdam. It is managed and maintained by the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation Berlin-Brandenburg with the voluntary support of the Stern-Parforceheide Hunting Lodge Association.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== The emergence of hunting lodges in the Mark Brandenburg ===\n\nIn the 16th century, Elector Joachim II Hector began building the first hunting lodges in Grimnitz, Bötzow (now Oranienburg), Grunewald and Köpenick around his residences in Berlin and Cölln in the Margraviate of Brandenburg. During the reign of the Great Elector Frederick William, further hunting lodges were built in the densely wooded and game-rich area around Berlin and Potsdam, including Groß Schönebeck and Glienicke.\nLike his predecessors, the Soldier King Frederick William I was also a passionate hunter who pursued this passion in Königs Wusterhausen, located south-east of Berlin. The manor and castle of Wusterhausen, which he received as a gift from his father Elector Frederick III (King Frederick I of Prussia from 1701) at the age of ten in 1698, was converted into a hunting lodge after his accession to the throne.\nAfter his accession to the throne in February 1713, he made Potsdam his residence. Between 1725 and 1729, he had a \"peasant heath\" south-east of the city gates opened up for his extensive hunts - the so-called par force heath. The extensive, flat terrain with sparse woodland and little undergrowth was ideal for these hunts on horseback, which had become a popular form of hunting at German courts at the end of the 17th century. In addition to fast dogs and horses, this type of hunting required clear terrain in order to be able to pursue the game over long distances until it collapsed exhausted. To make it easier for the widely dispersed hunting party to find their way around, the area was divided into segments by sixteen star-shaped aisles (racks). From the respective sections of the approximately one hundred square kilometer hunting ground, the hunters found their way back to their meeting point via the straight aisles that led to the center of the star.\n\n\n=== Construction of a building ensemble and use ===\n\nSlightly offset from the center of the star, between two rays, the Soldier King had a hunting lodge built between 1730 and 1732 in the style of a simple Dutch town house, which he named after the location. From the following year onwards, he had the Dutch Quarter in Potsdam built from a large number of similar houses. In addition to the extension to his hunting lodge in Königs Wusterhausen, the small hunting lodge Stern was the only new building that the soldier king, who was very frugal, had built for himself. The half-timbered house a few meters to the southwest was probably built at the same time as the hunting lodge and housed the castellan, who was also granted bar rights. The castellan's house was used for catering until 1992. The farm buildings included a stable building in the north-east, completed in 1733, in which at least 18 horses could be stabled. It has been used for residential purposes since a conversion around 1930. A barn with a small stable, a wash house with a privy and a well in the center of the star are no longer preserved. The structural remains of a brick oven were uncovered between 2006 and 2009 and rebuilt in 2011/2012 in accordance with the preservation order.\nWhen Frederick the Great came to power in 1740, par force hunts no longer took place around Potsdam. In his treatise \"Antimachiavell\", in which Frederick wrote down his thoughts on the tasks and aims of the exercise of princely power, he rejected hunting as a princely pastime and described hunting as one of those sensual pleasures that are hard on the body but do nothing for the spirit. His successors, Frederick William II and Frederick William III, had no interest either. In 1791, there were only a few driven hunts at Stern and during the Napoleonic occupation of Prussia, the hunting lodge served as accommodation for French soldiers. It was only under Frederick William IV, who in 1847 had the Hubertusstock hunting lodge built on the edge of the Schorfheide north of Berlin, the last Hohenzollern hunting lodge in the Mark Brandenburg, that hunting events took place again. As early as 1828, Prince Carl, a younger brother of the king, revived par force hunting, which was practiced until the 1890s.\n\n\n=== Changes of use after the end of the monarchy ===\nAfter the First World War and the end of the monarchy, the building was temporarily rented out to artists. Like most Hohenzollern palaces, the Stern hunting lodge came into the care of the Prussian \"Administration of State Palaces and Gardens\", founded on April 1 of the same year and since 1995 the \"Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation Berlin-Brandenburg\", in 1927. After the Second World War, it served as accommodation for the military protection unit for the British delegation during the Potsdam Conference and the entire complex was used as a vacation camp for schoolchildren from 1949 until the 1970s. After extensive renovation work in the 1980s, the hunting lodge was furnished with items from Königs Wusterhausen Castle for museum use, but these are no longer part of the collection today. Due to excessive pollution from wood preservatives, the building was closed for years from 1996 and could only be visited by appointment. Following the subsequent renovation work, it has been open to the public again since 2007.\nThe Parforceheide lost its area over time. Today, only eight paths of the sixteen-path snow system remain. In the north, the construction of the first Prussian Berlin-Potsdam railroad line and the Teltow Canal led to major losses of territory. In the west, the construction of the Wetzlarer Bahn and the AVUS with its later extension to the Autobahn 115, which passes close to the hunting lodge, and in the south, the Nuthe expressway. In addition, the residential areas of Stern, Drewitz and Kirchsteigfeld in Potsdam were built on former woodland.\n\n\n== Hunting lodge Stern ==\n\n\n=== Aversion to the splendor of the Baroque ===\nIn terms of cultural history, the 17th and 18th centuries are regarded as the most magnificent period in the history of hunting at European courts. In courtly society, it was a pleasure and pastime, but also a symbol of status and self-expression. It also served to cultivate dynastic and diplomatic relations and, with the spread of absolutism, became a matter of prestige for the pomp-loving sovereigns. Even for the lower nobility, the right to hunt - in a society divided into classes - was a visible enhancement that enabled them to distinguish themselves more clearly from the wealthy, non-noble classes. In addition to hunting events, glittering celebrations often took place, so that hunting lodges were built especially for the accommodation of guests, beginning as early as the 16th century, or existing, conveniently located buildings were furnished solely for this purpose.\nFrederick William I had a strong aversion to the luxurious lifestyle of the princely houses. He also rejected the exuberant decorative forms of Baroque architecture and preferred the clarity, clarity and cleanliness of the façades. Under his rule, the architectural style of Brandenburg-Prussia was dominated by practicality. The simplicity of the Stern hunting lodge reflects the frugal and spartan lifestyle of the soldier king. Particularly when compared with Moritzburg Castle near Dresden, which was converted into a Baroque hunting lodge at the same time, from 1723 to 1733, by the Elector of Saxony and King of Poland Frederick Augustus I/II, it becomes clear that the Prussian monarch did not use architecture for representation, as was generally the case at European courts.\n\n\n=== Choice of Dutch architecture ===\nIn the Mark, there had already been a strong connection to Holland since the beginning of the expansion of the country by Albrecht the Bear in the 12th century, which flourished again in the 17th and 18th centuries. The marriage of the Great Elector Frederick William to Luise Henriette of Orange-Nassau in 1646 encouraged the settlement of Dutch or Dutch-trained specialists for agriculture, landscaping, canal and dyke construction. In his Wanderungen durch die Mark Brandenburg, Theodor Fontane notes: \"Colonists were moved into the country, houses were built, outbuildings were laid out and all the details associated with agriculture were immediately carried out with diligence\" and the Dutch were \"[...] the real agricultural instructors for the Mark, especially for the Havelland\". Frederick William I also vigorously pursued the economic development of the country that had already been pursued under his grandfather, the Great Elector, with the settlement of foreign craftsmen and the simultaneous establishment of a strong army. Both resulted from the consequences and experiences of the Thirty Years' War, from which the Margraviate of Brandenburg had suffered particularly badly.\nAfter the first expansion of the Potsdam residence into a garrison town under the Soldier King, the so-called \"first baroque expansion of the town\" from 1722 to 1725, the \"second baroque expansion of the town\" took place between 1732 and 1742 due to the increase in civilian and military personnel. This period, between 1734 and 1742, also saw the construction of a Dutch Quarter. These houses were built for craftsmen whom the Soldier King had recruited for the expansion of Potsdam on his last trip to Holland in 1732. Through his family ties to the Dutch royal house and his study trips in 1700, 1704 and 1732, Frederick William I became acquainted with the engineering skills of the Dutch, who knew how to drain swampy terrain. The same soil conditions, which were difficult for building on, also existed in Potsdam. He was also impressed by the inexpensive, quick construction of Dutch brick houses.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Overview ===\n\nThe 17th century brick houses in Amsterdam's Noortse Bosch weaving district and the simple bell gables of Zaandam, as well as the simpler town houses in Leiden and Haarlem, probably served as models for the Dutch houses in Potsdam. As the Stern hunting lodge with the same architecture was completed shortly before construction of the first houses in the Dutch Quarter began, it is reasonable to assume that it served as a model house for the always economically minded Soldier King in order to better estimate the construction time and costs for the larger project. The name of the architect is not certain; it is possible that the house was built according to a plan obtained directly from Holland. The contract for the construction was probably awarded to the grenadier and master carpenter Cornelius van den Bosch (1679–1741) from Schipluiden near Delft, other sources mention Schipley near Grafenhaag (The Hague), who came to Potsdam around 1720. The first mention of the Dutchman can be found in a rank roll (list of names) dated 1726 as a \"long fellow\" in the Royal Regiment of Foot. Like the soldiers of the time, he also pursued a civilian profession after his daily military service and is mentioned in the construction files for the hunting lodge in connection with the ordering of timber. The French-born captain of the Corps of Engineers and court architect Pierre de Gayette supervised the construction, as evidenced by his signature under brick deliveries \"for the new house in the royal par force garden\" in August/September 1730.\n\n\n=== Exterior design ===\nThe Stern hunting lodge, modeled on the style of simple Dutch town houses, is a single-storey building with a bell gable and gabled roof. The outer walls, which rest on a rectangular ground plan, are made of red, unplastered brickwork. On the orders of Frederick William I, bricks with a uniform size of around 27 × 13 × 8 centimetres were used. The square quarter bricks at the corners of the gables and the brickwork in a special plait shape on the courtyard façade are reminiscent of Dutch brickwork. The five high sash windows in the three-axis front façade, the entrance door and two sash windows in each of the side walls are designed with glazing bars and plain frames, as had become fashionable in the better houses from 1690, first in England and then in Holland.\nThe three windows in the upper section, whose upper edge forms a line to the attic, simulate a two-storey structure. The smaller sliding windows with shutters, two on each side wall and five at the rear, illuminate the adjoining rooms. A wooden door in the south-west wall and at the rear of the house are side entrances that lead into the hallway and the adjutant's room. The only architectural decoration is a blind window with a star ornament in the bell gable and a relief above the central French window showing the head of the Roman goddess Diana with hunting equipment. The decorative elements made of light-colored sandstone were added later in the 19th century.\n\n\n=== Interior design ===\n\nLike the simple exterior architecture, the design of the interior building is deliberately purist in the spirit of Frederick William I, in keeping with the simple, bourgeois living culture of the Dutch, which corresponded to his idea of clarity and cleanliness. The modest room program includes a hall adjoined by a corridor and the kitchen, followed by an adjutant's room and a bedroom.\nThe hall takes up the entire width of the front façade and almost half of the house. It is the largest room in the building and was used for socializing after the hunt. The dome-shaped ceiling, divided into panels, extends into the attic area. The walls are clad with yellowish-brown wood paneling and the floor is covered with floorboards. The room was heated by an open fireplace made of dark red marble on the east wall, opposite the entrance door. The few room decorations include a mirror framed with golden ornamentation and five paintings set into the wall showing Frederick William I in various hunting scenes. The paintings were probably created by the painter Georg Lisiewski. Hunting trophies hang from the window pillars, indicating the use of the building. The five gilded stag heads carved out of wood with real antlers are the antlers of Frederick William I's favorite stag, known as the Great Hans, from the years 1732 to 1736. Little is known of the original furnishings, which are no longer preserved. An inventory list from 1826 lists a few items that may have been part of the hall's first furnishings: \"A long pine table painted with oil paint; four small green-painted square tables; three similar triangular corner tables; an old, completely unusable bench.\"\nNext to the fireplace, a door leads into the corridor that connects the hall with the rooms in the rear half of the house. The walls are whitewashed and the floor, as in the kitchen and the adjutant's room, is covered with reddish-brown, marble-like limestone slabs, which were also known as cutting stones or Gothland stones in the 18th century and were often used as ships' ballast. The manganese-coloured tiles of the skirting board in the rooms are ornamentally decorated with cornflowers and chequerboard flowers as well as stylized foliage and come from the Rotterdam manufactory of the former guild of tile burners. In addition to the entrances to the kitchen and the adjutant's room, another door in the south-west wall leads out of the building.\nThe kitchen on the north-east side was mainly used for warming and serving food, which was probably prepared in the castellan's house. The walls are tiled in white from floor to ceiling, as is the chimney above the brick-built stove. The original furnishings include a low built-in cupboard with a marble top under the windows, on which food could be served, and a marble sink next to it with a drain. The water pump with brass bladder is no longer preserved. The inventory list from 1826 lists further items for the kitchen: \"A blue-painted Schab [crockery cupboard]; [...] six bowls, three candlesticks, two faience salt cellars, dating from the Elector's time, all damaged; a jug; two jugs of Chinese porcelain with silver and gilded lids; a damaged glass goblet with gilding\".\nThe adjutant was accommodated in the room on the south-east side of the house. It was also the anteroom and the only way to get into the adjoining bedroom of the king. The building could also be entered and exited from here through a door. The whitewashed bedroom is dominated by a green-painted fitted wall with white framed panels. An alcove is set into the middle. Behind the concealed doors on either side of the bed recess, a staircase leads to the attic on the right and to the cellar on the left. The room was heated by a simple red-brick fireplace. As in the hall, the floor is covered with floorboards.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nLiterature by and about Stern Hunting Lodge in the German National Library catalogue\nTheo M.

        "content": "Millennials, also known as Generation Y, are the demographic cohort following Generation X and preceding Generation Z. The generation is typically defined as people born between 1981 and 1996. Millennials are reshaping political discourse, showing evolving attitudes towards governance, social issues, and economic policies. Their increasing political participation and distinct generational identity signify a transformative phase in contemporary politics, with potential long-term implications for national and global political trends.\nAmerican millennials exhibit a complex spectrum of political views, paralleling broader generational shifts in attitudes towards social, economic, and political issues. Surveys indicate a significant portion of millennials' political views align with their parents, though a notable fraction express more liberal tendencies. Key issues for US millennials include support for same-sex marriage, varying attitudes towards the LGBT community, and a more moderate stance on political ideologies compared to older generations. Millennials in the United States demonstrate increasing skepticism towards capitalism, with a preference for socialism seen in younger segments of the demographic. Canadian millennials played a crucial role in the election of Justin Trudeau, driven by social and economic liberal values. Despite historically low political participation, the 2015 federal election saw a surge in youth voter turnout, influenced by Trudeau's progressive campaign promises.\nBritish millennials, characterized by a relative political disengagement in their early years, have shown liberal tendencies on social and economic matters, favoring individual liberty and limited government intervention. Significant political moments like the Brexit referendum mobilized young voters, displaying a strong preference for remaining in the European Union, highlighting generational divides in political priorities and attitudes.\nAcross Europe, millennials are part of a larger shift towards post-materialist values, emphasizing environmentalism, social liberalism, and global citizenship. This generational shift is contributing to changing political landscapes, challenging traditional party alignments and contributing to the rise of new political movements.French millennials, while exempt from mandatory military service, still engage in a Defense and Citizenship Day, reflecting continued engagement with national civic duties. A significant majority support the reintroduction of some form of national service, reflecting broader desires for national cohesion and integration.\n\n\n== American millennials ==\n\n\n=== Views ===\n\nA 2004 Gallup poll of Americans aged 13 to 17 found that 71% said their social and political views were more or less the same as those of their parents. 21% thought they were more liberal and 7% more conservative. According to demographer and public policy analyst Philip Longman, \"even among baby boomers, those who wound up having children have turned out to be remarkably similar to their parents in their attitudes about \"family\" values.\" In the postwar era, most returning servicemen looked forward to \"making a home and raising a family\" with their wives and lovers, and for many men, family life was a source of fulfillment and a refuge from the stress of their careers. Life in the late 1940s and 1950s was centered about the family and the family was centered around children. Researchers found that while only 9% of teenagers who identified with the Republican Party considered themselves more conservative than their parents, compared to 77% who shared their parents' views, 25% of adolescents who identified with the Democratic Party and 28% of politically independent teens said they were more liberal than their parents. Another 2004 Gallup poll of the same age group found that a clear majority of teenagers considered themselves to be politically moderate, 56%. Only 7% and 18% deemed themselves very conservative or conservative, respectively, and 10% and 6% believed they were liberal or very liberal, respectively. (The bar plot roughly resembles a Gaussian distribution or an isosceles triangle centered around moderates. See right.) By comparing with a 2004 poll of Americans aged 18 and over, Gallup discovered that teens were substantially more moderate than adults (56% to 38%), less conservative (25% to 40%), and just about as liberal (16% to 19%). However, political scientist Elias Dinas discovered, by studying the results from the Political Socialisation Panel Study and further data from the United Kingdom and the United States, that while children born to politically engaged parents tended to be politically engaged themselves, those who absorbed their parents' views the earliest were also the most likely to abandon them later in life.\nThe Economist observed in 2013 that, like their British counterparts, millennials in the United States held more positive attitudes towards recognizing same-sex marriage than older demographic cohorts. However, a 2018 poll conducted by Harris on behalf of the LGBT advocacy group GLAAD found that despite being frequently described as the most tolerant segment of society, people aged 18 to 34—most millennials and the oldest members of Generation Z—have become less accepting LGBT individuals compared to previous years. In 2016, 63% of Americans in that age group said they felt comfortable interacting with members of the LGBT community; that number dropped to 53% in 2017 and then to 45% in 2018. On top of that, more people reported discomfort learning that a family member was LGBT (from 29% in 2017 to 36% in 2018), having a child learning LGBT history (30% to 39%), or having an LGBT doctor (27% to 34%). Harris found that young women were driving this development; their overall comfort levels dived from 64% in 2017 to 52% in 2018. In general, the fall of comfort levels was the steepest among people aged 18 to 34 between 2016 and 2018. (Seniors aged 72 or above became more tolerant of LGBT doctors or having their (grand) children taking LGBT history lessons during the same period, albeit with a bump in discomfort levels in 2017.) Results from this Harris poll were released on the 50th anniversary of the riots that broke out in Stonewall Inn, New York City, in June 1969, thought to be the start of the LGBT rights movement. At that time, homosexuality was considered a mental illness or a crime in many U.S. states.\n\nIn 2018, Gallup conducted a survey of almost 14,000 Americans from all 50 states and the District of Columbia aged 18 and over on their political sympathies. They found that overall, younger adults tended to lean liberal while older adults tilted conservative. More specifically, groups with strong conservative leanings included the elderly, residents of the Midwest and the South, and people with some or no college education. Groups with strong liberal leanings were adults with advanced degrees, whereas those with moderate liberal leanings included younger adults (18 to 29 and 30 to 49), women, and residents of the East. Gallup found little variations by income groups compared to the national average. Among adults between the ages of 18 and 29—older Generation Z and younger millennials—Gallup found that 30% identified as liberals, 40% as moderates, and 26% as conservatives. Among adults aged 30 to 49—older millennials and younger Generation X—they found that 30% considered themselves liberals, 37% moderates, and 29% conservatives.(See above.) Between 1992 and 2018, the number of people identifying as liberals steadily increased, 17% to 26%, mainly at the expense of the group identifying as moderates. Meanwhile, the proportion of conservatives remained largely unchanged, albeit with fluctuations. Between 1994 and 2018, the number of members of the Democratic Party identifying as liberal rose from 25% to 51%, as the number of both moderates and conservatives gradually fell. Liberals became a majority in this political party for the first time in 2018. During the same period, in the Republican Party, the proportion of people calling themselves conservatives climbed from 58% to 73% while the numbers of moderates and liberals both dropped. In other words, this political party saw its conservative majority expanding. Meanwhile, among political independents, the percentage of moderates, the dominant group, remained largely unchanged.2018 surveys of American teenagers 13 to 17 and adults aged 18 or over conducted by the Pew Research Center found that millennials and Generation Z held similar views on various political and social issues. More specifically, 56% of millennials believed that climate change is real and is due to human activities while only 8% reject the scientific consensus on climate change. 64% wanted the government to play a more active role in solving their problems. 65% were indifferent towards pre-nuptial cohabitation. 48% considered single motherhood to be neither a positive or a negative for society. 61% saw increased ethnic or racial diversity as good for society. 47% did the same for same-sex marriage, and 53% interracial marriage. (See chart.) In most cases, millennials tended hold quite different views from the Silent Generation, with the Baby Boomers and Generation X in between. In the case of financial responsibility in a two-parent household, though, majorities from across the generations answered that it should be shared, with 58% for the Silent Generation, 73% for the Baby Boomers, 78% for Generation X, and 79% for both the millennials and Generation Z. Across all the generations surveyed, at least 84% thought that both parents ought to be responsible for rearing children. Very few thought that fathers should be the ones mainly responsible for taking care of children.\nIn 2015, a Pew Research study found 40% of millennials in the United States supported government restriction of public speech offensive to minority groups. Support for restricting offensive speech was lower among older generations, with 27% of Gen Xers, 24% of Baby Boomers, and only 12% of the Silent Generation supporting such restrictions. Pew Research noted similar age related trends in the United Kingdom, but not in Germany and Spain, where millennials were less supportive of restricting offensive speech than older generations. In France, Italy, and Poland no significant age differences were observed. In the U.S. and UK during the mid-2010s, younger millennials brought changes to higher education via drawing attention to microaggressions and advocating for implementation of safe spaces and trigger warnings in the university setting. Critics of such changes have raised concerns regarding their impact on free speech, asserting these changes can promote censorship, while proponents have described these changes as promoting inclusiveness.\nA 2018 Gallup poll found that people aged 18 to 29 have a more favorable view of socialism than capitalism, 51% to 45%. Nationally, 56% of Americans prefer capitalism compared to 37% who favor socialism. Older Americans consistently prefer capitalism to socialism. Whether the current attitudes of millennials and Generation Z on capitalism and socialism will persist or dissipate as they grow older remains to be seen.\n\nGallup polls conducted in 2019 revealed that 62% of people aged 18 to 29—older members of Generation Z and younger millennials—support giving women access to abortion while 33% opposed. In general, the older someone was, the less likely that they supported abortion. 56% of people aged 65 or over did not approve of abortion compared to 37% who did. (See chart to the right.) Gallup found in 2018 that nationwide, Americans are split on the issue of abortion, with equal numbers of people considering themselves \"pro-life\" or \"pro-choice\", 48%.\nIn his doctoral dissertation submitted in 2003, social psychologist Jason Weeden conducted statistical analyses on general-public and undergraduate datasets and reached conclusions supporting the hypothesis that attitudes towards abortion are more strongly predicted by mating-relevant variables than by variables related to views on the sanctity of life. Some evolutionary psychologists and sociologists believe that the various mating strategies are in direct strategic conflict—a zero-sum game—and as such can influence political persuasion. For instance, the stability of long-term partnerships may be threatened by the availability of short-term sexual opportunities. Therefore, public policy measures that impose costs on casual sexual intercourse may benefit people pursuing long-term mating strategies by reducing the availability of short-term mating opportunities outside of committed relationships. Such policies include the prohibition of abortion and of recreational drug use. This relationship remained strong even when controlling for personality traits, political orientation, and moral values. By contrast, nonsexual variables typically associated with attitudes towards drug legalization were strongly attenuated or eliminated when controlling for sexuality-related measures. These findings were replicated in Belgium, Japan, and the Netherlands.\nPolls conducted by Gallup and the Pew Research Center found that support for stricter gun laws among people aged 18 to 29 and 18 to 36, respectively, is statistically no different from that of the general population. According to Gallup, 57% of Americans are in favor of stronger gun control legislation. In a 2017 poll, Pew found that among the age group 18 to 29, 27% personally owned a gun and 16% lived with a gun owner, for a total of 43% living in a household with at least one gun. Nationwide, a similar percentage of American adults lived in a household with a gun (41%).\nIn 2019, the Pew Research Center interviewed over 2,000 Americans aged 18 and over on their views of various components of the federal government. They found that 54% of the people between the ages of 18 and 29 wanted larger government and larger compared to 43% who preferred smaller government and fewer services. Meanwhile, 46% of those between the ages of 30 and 49 favored larger government compared to 49% who picked the other option. Older people were more likely to dislike larger government. Overall, the American people remain divided over the size and scope of government, with 48% preferring smaller government with fewer services and 46% larger government and more services. They found that the most popular federal agencies were the U.S. Postal Service (90% favorable), the National Park Service (86%), NASA (81%), the CDC (80%), the FBI (70%), the Census Bureau (69%), the SSA (66%), the CIA, and the Federal Reserve (both 65%). There is very little to no partisan divide on the Postal Service, the National Park Service, NASA, the CIA, the Census Bureau.\n\nAccording to a 2019 CBS News poll on 2,143 U.S. residents, 72% of Americans 18 to 44 years of age—Generations X, Y (millennials), and Z—believed that it is a matter of personal responsibility to tackle climate change while 61% of older Americans did the same. In addition, 42% of American adults under 45 years old thought that the U.S. could realistically transition to 100% renewable energy by 2050 while 29% deemed it unrealistic and 29% were unsure. Those numbers for older Americans are 34%, 40%, and 25%, respectively. Differences in opinion might be due to education as younger Americans are more likely to have been taught about climate change in schools than their elders. As of 2019, only 17% of electricity in the U.S. is generated from renewable energy, of which, 7% is from hydroelectric dams, 6% from wind turbines, and 1% solar panels. There are no rivers for new dams. Meanwhile, nuclear power plants generate about 20%, but their number is declining as they are being deactivated but not replaced.\n\nIn early 2019, Harvard University's Institute of Politics Youth Poll asked voters aged 18 to 29—younger millennials and the first wave of Generation Z—what they would like to be priorities for U.S. foreign policy. They found that the top issues for these voters were countering terrorism and protecting human rights (both 39%), and protecting the environment (34%). Preventing nuclear proliferation and defending U.S. allies were not as important to young American voters. The Poll found that support for single-payer universal healthcare and free college dropped, down 8% to 47% and down 5% to 51%, respectively, if cost estimates were provided.\nMillennials actively participated in the 2020-2021 George Floyd protests which were the largest series of protests against police brutality in the United States since the Civil Rights Movement.\n\n\n=== Votes ===\n\nMillennials are more willing to vote than previous generations when they were at the same age. With voter rates being just below 50% for the four presidential cycles before 2017, they have already surpassed members of Generation X of the same age who were at just 36%.\nPew Research described millennials as playing a significant role in the election of Barack Obama as President of the United States. Millennials were between 12 and 27 during the 2008 U.S. presidential election. That year, the number of voters aged 18 to 29 who chose the Democratic candidate was 66%, a record since 1980. The total share of voters who backed the President's party was 53%, another record. For comparison, only 31% of voters in that age group backed John McCain, who got only 46% of the votes. Among millennials, Obama received votes from 54% of whites, 95% of blacks, and 72% of Hispanics. There was no significant difference between those with college degrees and those without, but millennial women were more likely to vote for Obama than men (69% vs. 62%). Among voters between the ages of 18 and 29, 45% identified with the Democratic Party while only 26% sided with the Republican Party, a gap of 19%. Back in 2000, the two main American political parties split the vote of this age group. This was a significant shift in the American political landscape. Millennials not only provided their votes but also the enthusiasm that marked the 2008 election. They volunteered in political campaigns and donated money. But that millennial enthusiasm all but vanished by the next election cycle while older voters showed more interest. In 2012, when Americans reelected Barack Obama, the voter participation gap between people above the age of 65 and those aged 18 to 24 was 31%. Pew polls conducted a year prior showed that while millennials preferred Barack Obama to Mitt Romney (61% to 37%), members of the Silent Generation leaned towards Romney rather than Obama (54% to 41%). But when looking at white millennials only, Pew found that Obama's advantage which he enjoyed in 2008 ceased to be, as they were split between the two candidates.\nAlthough millennials are one of the largest voting blocs in the United States, their voting turnout rates have been subpar. Between the mid-2000s and the mid-2010s, millennial voting participation was consistently below those of their elders, fluctuating between 46% and 51%. For comparison, turnout rates for Generation X and the Baby Boomers rose during the same period, 60% to 69% and 41% to 63%, respectively, while those of the oldest of voters remained consistently at 69% or more. Millennials may still be a potent force at the ballot box, but it may be years before their participation rates reach their numerical potential as young people are consistently less likely to vote than their elders. In addition, despite the hype surrounding the political engagement and possible record turnout among young voters, millennials' voting power is even weaker than first appeared due to the comparatively higher number of them who are non-citizens (12%, as of 2019), according to William Frey of the Brookings Institution.\nIn general, the phenomenon of growing political distrust and de-alignment in the United States is similar to what has been happening in Europe since the last few decades of the twentieth century, even though events like the Watergate scandal or the threatened impeachment of President Bill Clinton are unique to the United States. Such an atmosphere depresses turnouts among younger voters. Among voters in the 18-to-24 age group, turnout dropped from 51% in 1964 to 38% in 2012. Although people between the ages of 25 and 44 were more likely to vote, their turnout rate followed a similarly declining trend during the same period. Political scientists Roger Eatwell and Matthew Goodwin argued that it was therefore unrealistic for Hillary Clinton to expect high turnout rates among millennials in 2016. This political environment also makes voters more likely to consider political outsiders such as Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump. The Brookings Institution predicted that after 2016, millennials could affect how politics is conducted in the two-party system of the United States, given that they were more likely to identify as liberals or conservatives than Democrats or Republicans, respectively. In particular, while Trump supporters were markedly enthusiastic about their chosen candidate, the number of young voters identifying with the GOP has not increased.\n\nBernie Sanders, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist and Democratic candidate in the 2016 United States presidential election, was the most popular candidate among millennial voters in the primary phase, having garnered more votes from people under 30 in 21 states than the major parties' candidates, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, did combined. According to the Brookings Institution, turnout among voters aged 18 to 29 in the 2016 election was 50%. Hillary Clinton won 55% of the votes from this age group while Donald Trump secured 37%. Polls conducted right before the election showed that millennial blacks and Hispanics were concerned about a potential Trump presidency. By contrast, Trump commanded support among young whites, especially men. There was also an enthusiasm gap for the two main candidates. While 32% of young Trump supporters felt excited about the possibility of him being President, only 18% of Clinton supporters said the same about her. The Bookings Institution found that among Trump voters in the 18-to-29 age group, 15% were white women with college degrees, 18% were the same without, 14% were white men with college degrees, and 32% were the same without, for a grand total of 79%. These groups were only 48% of Clinton voters of the same age range in total. On the other hand, a total of 52% of Clinton voters aged 18 to 29 were non-whites with college degrees (17%) and non-whites without them (35%). Clinton's chances of success were hampered by low turnouts among minorities and millennials with university degrees and students. Meanwhile, Trump voters included 41% of white millennials. These people tended to be non-degree holders with full-time jobs and were markedly less likely to be financially insecure than those who did not support Trump. Contrary to the claim that young Americans felt comfortable with the ongoing transformation of the ethnic composition of their country due to immigration, not all of them approve of this change despite the fact that they are an ethnically diverse cohort. In the end, Trump won more votes from whites between the ages of 18 and 29 than early polls suggested.\nAs is the case with many European countries, empirical evidence poses real challenges to the popular argument that the surge of nationalism and populism is an ephemeral phenomenon due to \"angry white old men\" who would inevitably be replaced by younger and more liberal voters. Especially since the 1970s, working-class voters, who had previously formed the backbone of support for the New Deal introduced by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, have been turning away from the left-leaning Democratic Party in favor of the right-leaning Republican Party. As the Democratic Party attempted to make itself friendlier towards the university-educated and women during the 1990s, more blue-collar workers and non-degree holders left. Political scientist Larry Bartels argued because about one quarter of Democrat supporters held social views more in-tune with Republican voters and because there was no guarantee millennials would maintain their current political attitudes due to life-cycle effects, this process of political re-alignment would likely continue. As is the case with Europe, there are potential pockets of support for national populism among younger generations.\nA Reuters-Ipsos survey of 16,000 registered voters aged 18 to 34 conducted in the first three months of 2018 (and before the 2018 midterm election) showed that overall support for Democratic Party among such voters fell by nine percent between 2016 and 2018 and that an increasing number favored the Republican Party's approach to the economy. Pollsters found that white millennials, especially men, were driving this change. In 2016, 47% of young whites said they would vote for the Democratic Party, compared to 33% for the Republican Party, a gap of 14% in favor of the Democrats. But in 2018, that gap vanished, and the corresponding numbers were 39% for each party. For young white men the shift was even more dramatic. In 2016, 48% said they would vote for the Democratic Party and 36% for the Republican Party. But by 2018, those numbers were 37% and 46%, respectively. This is despite the fact that almost two thirds of young voters disapproved of the performance of Republican President Donald J. Trump. According to the Pew Research Center, only 27% of millennials approved of the Trump presidency while 65% disapproved that year.\n\n\n== Canadian millennials ==\nHistorically, political participation among young Canadian voters has been low, no higher than 40%. However, the 2015 federal election was an exception, when 57% of the people aged 18 to 34 voted. Canadian millennials played a key role in the election of Justin Trudeau as Prime Minister of Canada. While Stephen Harper and the Conservative Party received approximately the same number of votes as they did in 2011, the surge in the youth vote was enough to push Trudeau to the top. His core campaign message centered around gender equality, tolerance, legalizing marijuana, addressing climate change, and governmental transparency while Harper focused on tax cuts. Nevertheless, political scientist Melanee Thomas at the University of Calgary warned that the electoral power of this demographic group should not be overestimated, since millennials do not vote as a single bloc. Even though millennials tend to vote for left-leaning candidates, certain items from right-leaning platforms can resonate with them, such as high but affordable standards of living.\nA 2018 survey of 4,000 Canadian millennials by Abacus Data found that 54% of the people asked favored socialism and 46% capitalism. Most want to address climate change, alleviate poverty, and adopt a more open immigration policy, but most important were micro-economic concerns, such as housing affordability, the cost of living, healthcare, and job-market uncertainties. Housing affordability is a key political issue for young Canadians, regardless of where they live, urban, suburban, or rural Canada. Because clear majorities are in favor of government interventionism, they generally tolerate deficit spending.\nAccording to Sean Simpsons of Ipsos, people are more likely to vote when they have more at stake, such as children to raise, homes to maintain, and income taxes to pay.\n\n\n== British millennials ==\n\nIn their youth during the early 21st century, British millennials were generally considered a relatively politically disengaged generation. Turnout at United Kingdom general elections fell sharply after the millennium with involvement lowest among the young. A majority of 18 to 24 year olds failed to vote in the 2001, 2005 and 2010 general elections with participation reaching a record low among this age group of 38.2% in 2005. The British Social Attitudes Survey suggested that the proportion of people in their 20s and early 30s who identified with a particular political party fell from 85% in 1983 to 66% in 2012. Later, various political events such as the 2014 Scottish Independence referendum, 2016 European Union membership referendum and 2017 general election were seen as sparking the interest of the millennial cohort though turnout at elections has remained below mid-to-late 20th century levels.\n\nThe Economist reported in 2013 that surveys of political attitudes among millennials in the United Kingdom revealed that they held more liberal views on social and economic matters than older demographic groups. They favored individual liberty, small government, low taxes, limited welfare programs, and personal responsibility. While support for increased welfare programs for the poor at the cost of potentially higher taxes has declined steadily since the 1980s among all living demographic cohorts in the U.K., Generation Y disapproved of such spending schemes the most, according to data from Ipsos MORI and the British Social Attitudes Survey. On the other hand, they had a more relaxed attitude towards alcohol consumption, euthanasia, same-sex marriage and the legalization of drugs. They disliked immigration, though less than their elders. They were more likely than their elders to support public debt reduction. They cared about the environment, but not at the expense of economic prosperity, and they supported privatizing utilities. In other words, they were classical liberals or libertarians. Ipsos pollster Ben Page told The Economist, \"Every successive generation is less collectivist than the last.\" \nA 2013 YouGov poll of almost a thousand people aged 18 to 24 in the United Kingdom found that 73% in total supported the legalization of same-sex marriage and only 15% opposed. 41% either strongly or somewhat supported legalizing \"soft\" drugs, such as cannabis while 46% strongly or somewhat opposed. The five most popular political parties for young Britons were the Labour Party (23%), the Conservative Party (12%), the Liberal Democratic Party (7%), the Green Party (7%), and the United Kingdom Independence Party (6%). 19% of British youths identified with no party whatsoever. When asked which politician they admired, 77% picked the \"none\" option, followed by Boris Johnson (4%). 59% had signed a petition. 47% had voted in a local or national election, and 19% had contacted a politician representing them. Overall, 60% had an unfavorable view of the British political system. 12% thought British immigration laws were too tough, 54% said they were too lax, and 16% deemed them appropriate. About one third opined that taxes and public spending were too high. 22% said they were insufficient and one fifth thought they were about right. 34% believed welfare benefits were too generous and should be cut. 22% argued they were not enough and should be increased and 24% thought they struck the right balance. Almost three quarters agreed that the welfare system was frequently abused and 63% thought those who genuinely needed it were branded as \"scroungers\". A total of 40% were proud and 46% not proud of Britain's current welfare system. Some 39% thought that the current welfare system is financially untenable and needs to be slashed while 49% thought the status quo is fine. A total of 65% were either very or fairly proud of the United Kingdom Armed Forces, 62% the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), 77% the National Health Service (NHS). 57% thought that it would be possible to keep the NHS free at the point of service and 26% thought the NHS would eventually need to charge people in order to stay afloat.\nAccording to a YouGov poll conducted right before the referendum on the possible departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Brexit) in 2016, almost three quarters of voters aged 18 to 24 opposed leaving the E.U. while just under one fifth supported leaving. 64% of Britons aged 25 to 29 and 61% between the ages of 30 and 35 supported remaining in the E.U. Meanwhile, 34% of pensioners wanted to remain and 59% wanted to leave. Older people were more likely to vote, and vote to leave. One of the reasons behind this generational gap is the fundamentally different environment that millennial voters grew up in. Many older voters came of age when Britain was a less ethnically diverse country, when collective memory of the British Empire and its victory in World War II was strong, when most people did not attend university, and spent a large part of their formative years in a society where abortion and homosexuality were illegal and the death penalty was in use. By contrast, millennials, many of whom supported the left-wing politician Jeremy Corbyn, grew up at a time when the United Kingdom was a member of the EU, when graduation from university was common, and when the political consensus favoured immigration and EU membership. But age is not the only reason, as voter data shows.\nBy analyzing polling data, the Wall Street Journal found that 19% of voters aged 18 to 24 either did not vote or were unsure, as did 17% of voters aged 25 to 49. Meanwhile, 10% of voters aged 50 to 64 and 6% of voters aged 65 and over abstained or were undecided. Overall, 52% (or 17.4 million) of British voters chose to leave and 48% (or 16.1 million) to remain in the E.U. Voter turnout was 72%, a sizeable figure, though not the largest on record after World War II, which was 84% in 1950. However, only 28.8 million people voted in 1950, compared to about 33.6 million in 2016. Still, it is the highest since 1992, as of 2019. That turnouts in millennial-majority constituencies were subpar while those in working-class neighborhoods were above average contributed to the outcome of the Brexit Referendum. Public opinion polls often underestimated the political power of working-class voters because these people are typically underrepresented in samples. Commonly made predictions of a victory for the Remain side created a sense of complacency among those who wanted the U.K. to remain in the European Union and a sense of urgency among those who wanted to leave.\nWhile young people tend to view the European Union more favorably, it is erroneous to believe that they all oppose Brexit for all the same reasons. For example, someone from Northern Ireland is probably more concerned about the prospects of a physical border between that part of the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland than, say, losing the ability to study abroad in continental Europe under the E.U.-sponsored Erasmus Program. Nor is it accurate to say that the proponents of Brexit form a homogeneous group. Besides many wealthy retirees, immigrants, and children of immigrants, one third of university graduates voted to leave. As of 2017, about half of young British adults under 30 years of age have attended or are attending an institution of higher education, a number higher than previous generations.\nA YouGov poll conducted in the spring of 2018 revealed that 58% of Britons between the ages of 25 and 49 thought that immigration to their country was \"too high\", compared to 41% of those aged 18 to 24.\nDespite reports of a surge in turnouts among young voters in the 2015 and 2017 United Kingdom general elections, statistical scrutiny by the British Elections Study revealed that the margin of error was too large to determine whether or not there was a significant increase or decrease in the number of young participants. In both cases, turnouts among those aged 18 to 24 was between 40% and 50%. Winning the support of young people does not necessarily translate to increasing young voters' turnouts, and positive reactions on social media may not lead to success at the ballot box. Initial reports of a youth surge came from constituency-level survey data, which has a strong chance of over-representing voters rather than the Kingdom as a whole. In addition, higher turnouts generally came from constituencies where there were already large proportions of young people, both toddlers and young adults, and such surges did not necessarily come from young voters. In 2017, there was indeed an increase in overall voter turnout, but only by 2.5%. A consistent trend in the U.K. and many other countries is that older people are more likely to vote than their younger countrymen, and they tend to vote for more right-leaning (or conservative) candidates.\nA 2021 report noted that the popular conception of British Millennials relationship with politics changed around the late 2010s from indifference to left-wing, socially liberal attitudes or \"millennial socialism\". The report which examined polling of millennials and adult Generation Z members political attitudes found clear negativity towards the idea of capitalism and positivity towards the idea of socialism in the abstract. There was also strong support for various socialist arguments though capitalist counter-arguments often also received plurality support. Commentators sometimes suggest that these attitudes are a natural aspect of youth which will pass as these people age though their some evidence against this. A analysis a British Election Study results for the 1964 to 2019 general elections found that whilst earlier age groups became more likely to vote Conservative as they got older millennials did not appear to be progressing in the same direction and an article on the analysis described them as \"by far the least conservative 35-year-olds in recorded history.\" The 2021 report also commented on this argument that:\n\nThis [1981 to 1996 birth years] means that in 2021, there is no such thing as a '20-year-old Millennial' anymore. The oldest Millennials have already turned 40, and in that age group... support for socialist ideas remains alive and well. We therefore cannot dismiss these people's opinions with phrases like 'They are just going through a phase' or 'They will grow out of it', as if we were talking about a teenager in a Che Guevara-shirt. It is true that socialist ideas are most popular among the young, but that is 'the young' in the very broadest sense – 'the young' in the sense of 'people up to their early 40s', not 'the young' in the sense of 'recent school leavers'\n\n\n== French millennials ==\n\nIn France, while year-long mandatory military service for men was abolished in 1996 by President Jacques Chirac, who wanted to build a professional all-volunteer military, all citizens between 17 and 25 years of age must still participate in the Defense and Citizenship Day (JAPD: Journée d'Appel de Préparation à la Défense, now Journée Défense et Citoyenneté), when they are introduced to the French Armed Forces, and take language tests. A 2015 IFOP poll revealed that 80% of the French people supported some kind of mandatory service, military, or civilian. The rationale for the reintroduction of national service was that \"France needs powerful tools to help promote integration, mix young people of different social backgrounds and levels, and to instill Republican values and national cohesion\". At the same time, returning to conscription was also popular; supporters included 90% of the UMP party, 89% of the National Front (now the National Rally), 71% of the Socialist Party, and 67% of people aged 18 to 24, even though they would be affected the most. This poll was conducted after the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks. In previous years, it averaged 60%.\n\n\n== Other European millennials ==\nThe period between the middle to the late twentieth century could be described as an era of \"mass politics\", meaning people were generally loyal to a chosen political party. Political debates were mostly about economic questions, such as wealth redistribution, taxation, jobs, and the role of government. But as countries transitioned from having industrial economies to a post-industrial and globalized world, and as the twentieth century became the twenty-first, topics of political discourse changed to other questions and polarization due to competing values intensified. While this new period of political evolution was taking place, a new cohort of voters—millennials—entered the scene and these people tend to think differently about the old issues than their elders. Moreover, they are less inclined than previous generations to identify (strongly) with a particular political party.\nBut scholars such as Ronald Inglehart traced the roots of this new \"culture conflict\" all the way back to the 1960s, which witnessed the emergence of the Baby Boomers, who were generally university-educated middle-class voters. Whereas their predecessors in the twentieth century—the Lost Generation, the Greatest Generation, and the Silent Generation—had to endure severe poverty and world wars, focused on economic stability or simple survival, the Baby Boomers benefited from an economically secure, if not affluent, upbringing and as such tended to be drawn to \"post-materialist\" values. Major topics for political discussion at that time were things like the sexual revolution, civil rights, nuclear weaponry, ethnocultural diversity, environmental protection, European integration, and the concept of \"global citizenship\". Some mainstream parties, especially the social democrats, moved to the left in order to accommodate these voters. In the twenty-first century, supporters of post-materialism lined up behind causes such as LGBT rights, climate change, multiculturalism, and various political campaigns on social media. Inglehart called this the \"Silent Revolution\". But not everyone approved, giving rise to what Piero Ignazi called the \"Silent Counter-Revolution\".\n\nThe university-educated and non-degree holders have very different upbringing, live very different lives, and as such hold very different values. Education plays a role in this \"culture conflict\" as national populism appeals most strongly to those who finished high school but did not graduate from university while the experience of higher education has been shown to be linked to having a socially liberal mindset. Degree holders tend to favor tolerance, individual rights, and group identities whereas non-degree holders lean towards conformity, and maintaining order, customs, and traditions. While the number of university-educated Western voters continues to grow, in many democracies non-degree holders still form a large share of the electorate. According to the OECD, in 2016, the average share of voters between the ages of 25 and 64 without tertiary education in the European Union was 66% of the population. In Italy, it exceeded 80%. In many major democracies, such as France, although the representation of women and ethnic minorities in the corridors of power has increased, the same cannot be said for the working-class and non-degree holders.\nBy analyzing voter data, political scientists Roger Eatwell and Matthew Goodwin came to the conclusion that the popular narrative that the rise of national-populist movements seen across much of the Western world is due largely to angry old white men who would soon be replaced by younger and more liberal voters is flawed. In many European democracies, national-populist politicians and political parties tend to be the most popular among voters below the age of 40. In France, Marine Le Pen and her National Rally (formerly the National Front) won more votes from people between the ages of 18 and 35 during the first round of the 2017 presidential election than any other candidates. In Italy, Matteo Salvini and his League have a base of support with virtually no generational gap. In Austria, more than one in two men between the ages of 18 and 29 voted for the Freedom Party in 2016. The Alternative for Germany's strongest support came not from senior citizens but voters between 25 and 50 years of age. The Sweden Democrats were the second most popular political party for voters aged 18 to 24 and the most popular for those between 35 and 54 before the 2018 Swedish general election. According to SVT, 13% of those aged 18–21 voted for the Sweden Democrats in 2018 and 14% of those aged 22–30, making them the third largest party in both cases. That figure rose to 21% of 31-64 year-olds, making them second biggest in that age group.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Parforceheide between the south of Berlin and the east of Potsdam is one of the last large contiguous forest areas in the Berlin-Brandenburg metropolitan region. Although located in Brandenburg, part of the forest is owned by the state of Berlin. The basis for this was created by the permanent forest contract or century contract of 1915. An area covering around 2350 hectares has been designated as the Parforceheide landscape conservation area since 1997. One of the aims of the conservation order is to preserve \"the area's function as a climatic compensation area in the south of the Berlin conurbation\". The name goes back to the par force hunts for which King Friedrich Wilhelm I had the Stern hunting lodge built in the forest in 1730.\n\n\n== Geography and geology ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nUntil the beginning of the 20th century, the northern boundary of the Parforceheide was formed by the Bäkefließ, which was largely absorbed into the Teltow Canal. The historical map from 1903 next to the table of contents still shows the Bäkefließ (with its old name Teltefließ) at the top of the picture. Since its construction between 1900 and 1906, the Teltow Canal has closed off the forest to the north, followed even further north on the other side of the canal by the forests of Dreilinden. Between the Teltow Canal and the forest to the east is the narrow Berlin strip of Albrecht's Teerofen, which extends into Brandenburg here, so that a narrow strip of forest along the canal lies on Berlin territory.\n\nTo the east, the woodland is bordered by the extensive parkland of the Südwestkirchhof Stahnsdorf (Stahnsdorf South-Western Cemetery) and the Wilmersdorfer Waldfriedhof Stahnsdorf, whose area was part of the Parforceheide until the cemeteries were established in 1909 and 1920 respectively. On the other hand, the only village in the immediate vicinity of the forest, Güterfelde, the former Gütergotz, borders the Parforceheide to the east. The Güterfelder Heide marked on some maps is assigned to the par force heath by the responsible forestry office in Nudow.\nThe western boundary is formed by the road that connects Berlin with the former exclave of Steinstücken, which still belongs to Berlin today.\nTo the west of Steinstücken are the Potsdam development areas of Drewitz, Am Stern and Kirchsteigfeld; from Stern, the western boundary runs parallel to the A 115 highway. The highway cuts through the forest, which is connected by two pedestrian bridges over the roadway; a new rest area built in 2004 on the A 115 is called Parforceheide. The southern end of the forest area is at the intersection of the Güterfelde-Philippsthal and Drewitz-Ludwigsfelde roads. Other smaller forest parcels lie outside the outlined boundary and are not specified here in more detail for the sake of clarity.\nWorth mentioning is the almost 22-hectare Wüste Mark farmland, which lies in the middle of the Parforceheide and was farmed as an exclave by a Berlin farmer from Zehlendorf until 1988.\n\n\n=== Ice age, sand and pine ===\nThe Parforceheide is geologically part of the Berlin-Brandenburg landscape of Teltow, whose name goes back to the original term \"Telte\" for the Bäke river. The Teltow is a typical plate north of the Brandenburg ice edge. It was formed just over 20,000 years ago during the Weichselian Ice Age. For the most part, it is occupied by flat undulating ground moraines. The special feature of the Parforceheide is that the boulder clay typical of ground moraines is largely absent and therefore older deposits, meltwater sands from the advance phase of the inland ice, are present on the surface. They are on average 15 to 20 meters thick. Brown soils developed on the sands in the post-glacial period, but these only have a low yield potential. The dry sandy soils typical of the Teltow shape the character of the Parforceheide forest, which has been given the name \"Heide\" (heath), which is only used in eastern Germany for forest locations far from groundwater. With its sparse stand of pine trees, the forest offered ideal conditions for King Frederick William I's need to cut the wide tracks through the wood required for par force hunting.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Par force hunting and star ===\n\nPar force hunts, which have been practiced with passion at European courts since the 16th and 17th centuries, gave the par force hunt its name. This form of hunting requires paths that are as flat and clear as possible in a forest with as little undergrowth as possible, as the riders have to follow the packs of hounds that chase the game to exhaustion. This form of hunting is now prohibited in Germany and was even banned in England, a country with a particularly cherished hunting tradition and an influential hunting lobby, in 2005. Hunting in the Parforceheide was mainly for wild boar and, to a lesser extent, fallow deer. Red deer are said to have only existed in small numbers in the forests near Berlin even then.\nThe existing hunting grounds in Brandenburg were not suitable for this form of hunting. At the beginning of the 18th century, the \"Soldier King\" Frederick William I found an ideal area for par force hunting in the Parforceheide, as it has been known since that year, and had an area of around one hundred square kilometers prepared for par force hunting between 1725 and 1729. A central square was created around seven kilometers from the royal city palace, from which 16 dead-straight double tracks (racks) were cut into the forest in a star shape - with names such as Priestergestell, Breite Gestell, Turmgestell or Weg nach Kohlhasenbrück. This star still exists, but only eight radial paths or roads have been preserved. Today it belongs to the Potsdam district of Stern, which is named after it. In the past, it was also known as the Great Star - not to be confused with the Great Star of the same name on the Victory Column in Berlin.\n\n\n=== Stern Hunting lodge ===\n\nThe writer Theodor Fontane hiked through the Parforceheide via the Stern to Güterfelde in 1869:\n\nFrom Kohlhasenbrück we take a southerly direction, meandering along footpaths through a well-kept copse and then enter a clearing from which we can see the racks radiating through the forest. This clearing is called the 'star'; in the middle of it, surrounded by a few acacias, is a hunting lodge of the same name.\nHowever, the Stern hunting lodge, which the Prussian monarch had built in the forest in 1730, is more of a small country house than a castle. According to Fontane, the house was\n\na Dutch building, square in red brick, with a gable in the front, a hunting horn above the door and an etched star in the center window. It consists only of a dining room, a kitchen and a bedroom, three rooms that have retained their character to this day.\n\nA character that Fontane was anything but pleased with, as the sight of the panels with their hunting trophies in the dining room made the poet of the Mark lament a \"deep and sudden decay of art\", \"beyond lay art, on this side barbarism\". The royal bedroom reminded Fontane \"of the storage facilities of an old ship's cabin\" and seemed to him like an eerie cave.\nWe learn from Adelheid Schendel in the brochure Jagdschloss Stern published by the palace administration in 1987 that the little palace is a representative example of the \"spartan, simple lifestyle\" of the soldier king in contrast to his ostentatious predecessors. According to this, it is a simple Dutch house on Brandenburg soil. Whilst the hall is still of sophisticated design, \"an important of the already rare examples of interior design from the period between Schlüter and Knobelsdorff\", \"the other rooms of the castle display the simple practicality of Dutch town houses\". Adelheid Schendel also describes the bed more realistically than Fontane: \"The bed in the bedroom, inserted into a wooden wall between staircase doors, is reminiscent of ship berths or bed stores in Frisian fishermen's and sailors' houses.\"\nIn the 1980s, the hunting lodge underwent a thorough renovation, but was closed again in 2005 for further renovation work. In addition to the main building, on which the Dutch Quarter in Potsdam was based, the old castellan's house, which was probably built in 1714, has been preserved. After par force hunting was discontinued under Frederick the Great and revived under Frederick Charles of Prussia, this form of hunting finally came to an end at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\n\n=== Berlin property in Brandenburg ===\n\n\n==== Berliner Luft - The permanent forest contract ====\n\nToday, Stern and Jagdschloss are located directly next to the 115 freeway and are shielded from the high volume of the six-lane arterial road by visual and noise barriers. A former aisle leads through a tunnel under the highway to the east into the Parforceheide, and to the west are the new housing developments in the \"Stern\" district, which were built in the middle of the Parforceheide. The fact that large parts of the forest landscape have been preserved despite the immediate peripheral location to the Berlin and Potsdam metropolitan areas and despite massive, irreparable encroachments on the landscape conservation area with buildings such as the highway-like Nuthe expressway and the Potsdam freeway junction is due not least to a decision made by the Berlin city fathers in 1915 and 1920 when the Berlin metropolitan area was founded.\nThe permanent forest contract, also known as the contract of the century, which the Greater Berlin municipal association concluded with the Royal Prussian State in 1915, stipulated that the Parforceheide must remain as a source of air for Berlin. For 50 million gold marks, the special-purpose association purchased large sections of forest, around 10,000 hectares in total, from the Prussian state in the Grunewald, Tegel, Grünau, Köpenick and Potsdam foresters and undertook not to build on or sell on the acquired forest areas, but to preserve them in the long term for the citizens as a local recreation area.\nIn addition to the ecological and recreational aspects, which were already important at the time, the background to the purchases was to secure the water supply for the rapidly growing population in the greater Berlin area and to curb rampant land speculation.\n\n\n==== Restitution by the Treuhand in 1995 ====\nParts of the Parforceheide belonged to the purchased area, which also formally became Berlin property in 1920 when the special-purpose association was transferred to the legal successor, the municipality of Greater Berlin. Legally, this part of the forest has the status of \"private property of the Berlin Forests in the State of Brandenburg\". After the final division of Germany and the founding of the GDR in 1949, West Berlin was cut off from the Parforceheide outside. East Berlin also lost ownership of the Parforceheide when, in 1952, all the forests outside Berlin were declared public property and came under the administration of the state of Brandenburg or the district of Potsdam.\n\nFollowing the reunification of the separate districts and the restitution of the surrounding forest areas by the Treuhandanstalt in 1995, part of the forest once again belongs to the city of Berlin and is managed by the Dreilinden forestry district. Of Berlin's total forest area of around 29,000 hectares, 16,000 hectares are now in Berlin and 13,000 hectares outside in Brandenburg. The Berlin part of the Parforceheide is mainly located in the area between Albrechts Teerofen, Kohlhasenbrück, Steinstücken and the Südwestkirchhof Stahnsdorf, which is also Berlin territory in Brandenburg (owned by the Evangelical Church). There are also scattered smaller Berlin areas, such as Güterfelder Haussee.\nIn addition to the Berlin part of the Parforceheide and the Brandenburg part, for which the Nudow forestry district (formerly Forsthaus Ahrensdorf) is responsible, the third owner is the Federal Republic of Germany, which holds former GDR military areas in the forest region near Güterfelde as a federal forest.\n\n\n== Ecology I: Flora and fauna ==\nAs the \"division of the Berlin forests into an eastern and a western part [...] lasted less than a generation of trees\", the differences in forest development are \"not so serious\" according to Reiner Cornelius, despite different positions, and can be compensated for relatively easily on the path taken today towards more natural stand forms. In addition, the GDR guidelines for forest management were still comparatively moderate until 1975, and during the subsequent intensification of economic forest use in East Germany, Berlin's forests, including those outside, were treated with special care. The forest suffered considerably greater damage before the division of Germany.\n\n\n=== The Parforceheide forest ===\n\nThere are no longer any natural forest communities in Berlin and the surrounding Brandenburg region, and the par force heath is also an artificially created forest community. The first reclamations and draining after the founding of the Mark Brandenburg in the middle of the 12th century already changed the natural forest structure. The pressure of the growing towns led to the establishment of pitch distilleries such as Albrecht's tar kiln, and the wood from the forest was used extensively for building houses and fires. The later electoral and royal hunting activities also had an impact on the condition of the forest. Around 45% of the forests fell victim to the most sustained overexploitation during the Second World War and in the times of need in the first post-war years. Around 1950, the clear-cut areas were largely reforested with fast-growing pine. As a result, a relatively high proportion of the Parforceheide today consists of pure pine stands that are around 50 years old. In addition, there are older, still preserved pine remnants, as the pine was already promoted by forestry in the centuries before, as it thrives well on the nutrient-poor but loose sandy soil of the Teltow and the profitability-oriented plantations gave preference to fast-growing main tree layers (the coniferous forest grows quickly into money).\nThe natural forest communities before the year 1200 consisted of pine-oak forests on the plateau sands of the Berlin oak valley. The proportion of pine was well below 50% - today it accounts for around 70% in the greater Berlin-Brandenburg area, 80 to 85% in the Brandenburg part of the Parforceheide and around 90% in the Berlin part, according to the respective forester's offices. With their equally low demands on nutrient and water supply, oaks, beeches and birches in particular complement the pine forest.\n\n\n=== Alluvial forest remnants and water bodies ===\n\nIn addition to these stands, the Parforceheide on the Hirtengraben, especially in the meadow and pond area of the Große Rohrlake, has small remnants of valuable quarry and floodplain forests, which, according to the forester's office, are dying off. The main reason for this is the drying up of the Hirtengraben in its upper course, which in turn is caused by the lowering of the water level at Güterfelder Haussee.\n\n\n==== Haussee and Hirtengraben ====\n\nThe shallow ice age lake is located to the east on the edge of the forest directly in front of the village of Güterfelde and covers an area of just under 5 hectares. Known as the \"Pearl of Parforceheide\" due to its location in the forest and its bathing beach, the Haussee was threatened with silting up after the nearby extensive sewage fields were abandoned at the end of the 1980s. Although a 1.2 million euro restoration of the lake in 2003 halted this process, it did not prevent the water level from still being more than one meter too low today. The Hirtengraben, the natural outlet of the lake, no longer receives any water. As the Hirtengraben is the only major watercourse in the Parforceheide and crosses the entire forest from east to west, the consequences for its water balance are dramatic and are leading to the death of the last of the swamp forests that depend on high moisture levels.\nThe last few meters of the ditch in the Parforceheide are fed by rain. It runs under the highway to Drewitz (rarely marked footpath on the right and left) into the individually designed Kirchsteigfeld district, which was built by an international ensemble of architects after reunification. Here, the Hirtengraben still has a flowing character today - much to the advantage of this showpiece of architectural postmodernism, which incorporated the Hirtengraben as a central component of the landscape-defining elements in the project. The Hirtengraben continues through a park on both sides to the recently dammed and protected biotope \"Der Teich\". The further, currently underground course through the old town of Drewitz is to be uncovered. The last section of Hirtengraben flows open again and flows into the Nuthe, which flows parallel to the Havel in a south–north direction just under two kilometers west of the forest.\n\n\n==== Forest at the Teltow Canal ====\nIn addition to the Haussee lake, there are various small pools and ponds. The only larger body of water in the Parforceheide catchment area, the Teltow Canal, only has an ecological impact on a limited strip of forest running parallel to the canal due to its northern location. Here there are still swamp strips of the former Bäketal valley with old oak stands and riparian forests. At the end of the Teltow Canal near Kohlhasenbrück (see there), just a few meters behind the edge of the forest, the Bäkewiese nature reserve has been designated since 1988, which is home to an impressive cormorant colony between the canal and Griebnitzsee lake.\n\n\n=== Other flora ===\n\nA naturally developed herb layer and a richly structured woody layer with the corresponding fauna is no longer present in the Berlin-Brandenburg forests or in the Parforceheide. According to district forester Bernd Krause, however, extensive areas of heather have developed in recent years and there has also been a marked return of blueberry. Among the taller shrubs, the late weeping cherry and the buckthorn can be found to a significant extent. The deciduous tree, which can grow up to six meters high, likes the acidic loam-clay soils of the Teltow, whose dry and nutrient-poor sandy areas are also suitable for undemanding grasses such as sheep's fescue and lichens.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nThere were hardly any red deer even at the time of the electoral par force hunts. Today, it no longer occurs at all; between 1980 and 1990, there was briefly some fallow deer. In the 21st century, the par force heath has a high population of roe deer and wild boar. According to Bernd Krause, there are around eight roe deer per 100 hectares and around six wild boar per 100 hectares. Based on the total area of the Parforceheide nature reserve of 2,350 hectares, the total number of roe deer and wild boar is around 190 and 140 respectively. Despite intensive hunting, the populations are increasing. Occasionally there are also Berlin imports from the Grunewald: in February 2005, a pack of black leopards swam through the nearby Griebnitzsee and devastated 1,300 m2 of meadow next to the forest, much to the annoyance of the Brandenburgers.\nThe already high number of foxes continues to rise, badgers and stone martens remain stable with a slight upward trend and the number of polecats is falling. Birds include the goshawk, sparrowhawk and especially the black woodpecker, reptiles are represented by the slow worm, amphibians in large numbers by the common toad, whose population is developing well in the many small ponds. In the group of insects, the number of nests of the largest European wasp, the hornet, is increasing significantly, while the populations of the red wood ant continue to decline in the Parforce Heath. In older oak stands near the Teltow Canal, the endangered large oak longhorn beetle or giant longhorn beetle, which forestry had long classified as a pest, can be found. The imposing longhorn beetle, whose backward-curved antennae can reach a length of ten centimetres in males, is now strictly protected under the EU Habitats Directive.\n\n\n== Ecology II: Landscape conservation area ordinance ==\nSince the 1990s, the forestry offices have been working on slowing down harmful developments and creating near-natural areas. To this end, they are focusing on measures such as the careful suppression of non-native tree species, avoiding clear-cutting, increasing the proportion of dead wood and avoiding the use of fertilizers and pesticides.\nIn 1994, Berlin and Brandenburg introduced a new cross-state forestry framework plan (FRP) with the aim of coordinating and sustainably securing the utilization, protection and recreational functions of the forest. In 1997, this planning was partly reflected in the ordinance on the approximately 2,350-hectare landscape conservation area, in which the function of the area as a climatic compensation area in the south of the Berlin metropolitan area is expressly emphasized as a protective purpose - entirely in the spirit of the 1915 special-purpose association. The ordinance on the Parforceheide landscape conservation area of the state of Brandenburg dated November 12, 1997, which also applies to the Berlin and federal parts of the Parforceheide, highlights the following additional conservation purposes as well as maintenance and development measures for \"this Pleistocene landscape\":\n\n\n=== Protection purposes ===\nExcerpts from § 3 of the ordinance:\n\nConservation and restoration of the ecosystem in terms of\nthe functionality of the soil,\nthe functionality of the water balance and the near-natural development of watercourses,\nan extensive, structurally rich and partially undisturbed landscape as a habitat for a species-rich flora and fauna,\nthe preservation of the largely culture-independent, diverse biotopes,\nthe preservation of near-natural, contiguous forests,\n[...]\nthe importance as a buffer zone for the nature reserves enclosed by the area,\nthe preservation, restoration and development of the beauty, diversity and uniqueness of a typical section of the young moraine landscape of the North German Plain,\nthe sustainable safeguarding of the recreational function.\n\n\n=== Maintenance and development measures ===\nSection 6 lists measures such as the conservation of wet meadows through scrub clearance, mowing or grazing and the conversion of meadows on fenland sites to extensive forms of cultivation. Small bodies of water, pools and ponds as well as ditches, where they have replaced former streams, are to be renaturalized. The existing pine forest communities are to be \"converted into stands that are oriented towards the potential natural vegetation\". To develop a nature-friendly recreational area, the ordinance provides for \"a network of cycle paths, hiking trails and bridle paths\" and the old cobbled streets are to be preserved as far as possible.\n\n\n=== Aspiration and reality ===\nThe ordinance on the landscape conservation area did not prevent the destruction of woodland areas at the beginning of the 21st century by the new development districts in Potsdam described above, the Nuthe expressway and the six-lane expansion of the A 115. The current state of the flora and fauna also shows that the LSG has not had the desired effect in all areas.\n\nThe required near-natural development of the watercourses is offset by the drying out of the Hirtengraben,\nThe death of the last alluvial forests and the loss of the last riparian forests contradict the required preservation of natural vegetation.\nThe required preservation of contiguous forests took a back seat to any major road construction.\nOnly eight years later, the requirements of this 1997 regulation have been overtaken by reality in important respects. In May 2004, against great resistance, the Brandenburg Nature Conservation Act was amended, with the result that the Potsdam-Mittelmark District Nature Conservation Advisory Council lost its previous right of objection, for example in planning procedures. The seven-member voluntary advisory board, which included two very committed citizens from Kleinmachnow and Güterfelde who were concerned about the Parforceheide and the Bäketal, resigned as a result.\nThe successful measures include increasing the proportion of dead wood, which remains in its natural state on the one hand and on the other hand serves to create a very high number of Benjes hedges to promote near-natural vegetation. The development of cycle paths, bridleways and hiking trails is progressing, and a new pedestrian bridge over the Nuthe expressway has linked the Große Rohrlake better to the network of paths from the direction of Stern since 2005.\nIn 2014, the application for a special helicopter landing pad by a Schönefeld furniture company in the Parforceheide on the former military training area near Güterfelde on the Haussee was announced and publicly criticized.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nMartin Klees: Der Berliner Waldbesitz im Wandel der Zeiten.

        "content": "Marambionectes (meaning \"Marambio Island swimmer\") is an extinct genus of weddellonectian elasmosaurid plesiosaur from the Late Cretaceous López de Bertodano Formation of Antarctica. The genus contains a single species, M. molinai, known from a partial skeleton.\n\n\n== Discovery and naming ==\nThe Marambionectes holotype specimen, IAA-Pv 752, was discovered in 2018 in sediments of the López de Bertodano Formation (unit 9) near on Marambio (Seymour) Island of James Ross Archipelago, Antarctica. The specimen is partially articulated and incomplete, consisting of the basioccipital, mandible, some teeth, cervical, pectoral, dorsal, and caudal vertebrae, ribs, an ilium, the right humerus and ulna, and a femur. The specimen belonged to an adult animal.\nIn 2024, O'Gorman et al. described Marambionectes molinai as a new genus and species of elasmosaurid plesiosaur based on these fossil remains. The generic name, Marambionectes, combines a reference to Marambio Island, where the fossil material was found, with  the Greek word \"nectes\", meaning \"swimmer\". The specific name, molinai, honors the Argentinian fossil preparator Omar J. Molina and his Antarctic field work.\n\n\n== Classification ==\nIn their phylogenetic analyses, O'Gorman et al. (2024) recovered Marambionectes as a derived member of the elasmosaurid clade Weddellonectia, as the sister taxon to the Aristonectinae. Their results are shown in the cladogram below:\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Carew Reynell (1636–1690) was an English economic writer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nReynell born in 1636, and descended of the family of Reynell of East Ogwell, Devonshire, was grandson of Sir George Reynell, marshal of the king's bench, and son of Carew Reynell (died 1657), also marshal of the king's bench, who resided at Rivershill in the parish of Binstead, Hampshire. His mother was Mary, daughter of Marcellus Rivers of St. Saviour's, Southwark, and Rivershill. His only brother, George, was fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and canon of Lincoln from 1682 till his death in 1687, when he was buried in the chapel of his college.\nCarew entered at Wadham College, Oxford, on 16 July 1652 as a gentleman commoner. He left Oxford without a degree, and in 1654 was entered a student of the Middle Temple (Gardiner, Wadham College, p. 198). In 1655 he was sent to Exeter gaol on a charge of complicity in the rising against the government at Salisbury of John Penruddock (see State Papers, Dom. Interreg. cxxviii. 8). His father petitioned the council to pardon him on account of his youth, and General Desborough was ordered, after taking security from the elder Reynell for his good conduct, to send him home. It is probable that he then went abroad. In 1657 he succeeded to his patrimony of Rivershill, and in 1661 greeted the Restoration with an extravagant ode, ‘The Fortunate Change, being a Panegyrick to his sacred Majesty King Charles II,’ London, 1661, fol. It was reprinted in ‘Fugitive Poetical Tracts’ (2nd ser. No. xxiv). Thenceforth Reynell devoted himself to economic studies. He died, at his house in Shoreditch, in 1690.\nHe married, first, Anna, widow of one Metcalfe; his second wife was named Elizabeth, widow of Ralph Took of Took's Court (cf. Chester, Marriage Licences, ed. Foster, col. 1125). By the first wife he had a son, Carew, and by the second wife a daughter, Anne.\nReynell's economic study resulted in ‘The True English Interest, or an Account of the Chief Natural Improvements and some Political Observations demonstrating an Infallible Advance of this Nation to infinite Wealth and Greatness, Trade and Populacy, with Employment and Preferment for all Persons,’ London, 1674, 8vo (licensed 5 Sept. 1673). It is a noticeable book, though it accepts the mercantile theory without question. It was noticed in ‘Philosophical Transactions,’ No. 102, 27 April 1674, vol. ix. In the twenty-seventh chapter (p. 79), ‘of learning’ (and libraries), Reynell says: ‘Much more would be said of this subject, but I refer that to my “Discourse of the Advancement of Learning,”’ of which nothing is known.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Shaw, William Arthur (1896). \"Reynell, Carew (1636-1690)\".

        "content": "Harriet Gunn (née Turner, 1806 – 1869) was an English illustrator and lithographer who specialised in illustrations of ecclesiastical art. Beginning as an illustrator of antiquarian books and travel writing, she produced portraits for publications and is noted for her personal project of reproducing medieval rood screens. She was also a writer, anonymously publishing a book on church polity and having her letters printed as a travel account.\n\n\n== Early life and family ==\nShe was born Harriet Turner in 1806, the fourth daughter of polymath Dawson Turner and his wife Mary, née Palgrave, an artist and draughtswoman. Along with her sisters, Maria, Elizabeth, Mary Anne, Harriet, Hannah, and Eleanor, she received artistic training from engraver John Sell Cotman from 1812. Hannah Sarah Turner continued her artistic career after her marriage to banker Thomas Brightwen, producing lithographs as Hannah Sarah Brightwen.\n\n\n== Artistic career ==\n\n\n=== Topographical History of Norfolk ===\n\nAround 1810, Dawson Turner began a project supplying extra illustrations for Francis Blomefield’s An Essay Towards A Topographical History of the County of Norfolk. Harriet and her mother and sisters contributed the bulk of the illustrations, supplying over 4000 drawings between them.\n\n\n=== Account of a Tour in Normandy ===\nIn 1820 the family produced a collaborative two-volume Account of a Tour in Normandy, drawing on letters and journals from their family tour in Normandy of 1818. Mary, Cotman, and Harriet and her sisters provided the illustrations.\n\n\n=== Reproductions of ecclesiastical art ===\nOn 27 April 1830, Harriet married John Gunn, rector of Irstead, Great Yarmouth, and amateur geologist and archaeologist. The paired toured Norfolk in pursuit of their interests, Harriet producing illustrations of architecture and ecclesiastical art. Her particular area of interest was rood screens, which preserved rare samples of medieval painting. With the help of her sisters Hannah and Mary Anne, she produced about 250 drawings of this underrepresented antiquarian feature. She exhibited her drawings at the annual congress of the Royal Archaeological Institute in 1847 and at a temporary museum at the Swan Hotel, Norwich.\n\n\n== Writing ==\nThe anonymous 1833 book Conversations on Church Polity, by A Lady is attributed to Harriet Gunn.\nIn 1834, Dawson Turner edited and printed Letters Written During a Four Days’ Tour in Holland from Harriet's letters without her prior knowledge.\n\n\n== Death ==\nShe died in September 1869.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWorks by Harriet Gunn held by the National Portrait Gallery",

It contains five convex whorls, sloping on the sides and obliquely truncated above. The body whorl is sub-compressed, most convex above, its width about equal to the length of the aperture. The aperture is narrowed above, wide below and rounded anteriorly. There are two folds on the columella: the upper one heavy and rounded, the lower or anterior one, obsolete. The columellar edge of the body whorl in one of the casts is marked by acute-angular striae, one branch extending directly upwards on the outside of the whorls (inside of the shell), and soon becoming obsolete. The other branch runs into the columellar cavity. \n\n\n== Distribution ==\nFossils of this marine species have been found in Cretaceous strata in New Jersey, USA.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWhitfield R.P.

        "content": "Allen Chamberlain (1867 – 1945) was an American journalist, conservationist, and author. For many years, he lived in Winchester, Massachusetts.\nIn 1897, he co-founded the Massachusetts Forestry Association (MFA), later renamed to the Massachusetts Forestry and Parks Association (MFPA). Starting in 1901, Chamberlain was a leader in the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC). He held multiple offices in the club, and was president in 1906. In 1916, he was instrumental in forming the New England Trail Conference (NETC), a confederation of several hiking and trail clubs across New England.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nIn 1897, Allen Chamberlain was commuting home from Boston to Winchester with his friend Joseph Nowell, when both men discussed the health of the forest lining the railroad. Together, Chamberlain and Nowell formed the Massachusetts Forestry Association (MFA), the purpose of which was \"to introduce judicious methods in dealing with forest and woodlands; to arouse and educate a public interest in this subject; to promote the afforestation of unproductive lands; to encourage the planting and care of shade trees.\"\nChamberlain served as the executive secretary of the MFA from its inception until 1911. During that period, the MFA embarked on several initiatives to protect local forests. Much of the work involved lobbying Massachusetts state government. For example, MFA lobbying is credited with convincing legislators to pass a law, \"establishing the office of the state forester and a state forest nursery.\"\nChamberlain gradually broadened his impact from the state level to the regional and then national level. Starting in 1901, he was a leader in the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC). Although the AMC was not exclusively concerned with conservation, it had influence across New England and beyond. As head of the AMC Exploration and Forestry committee, Chamberlain struck a balance between conservation and legitimate timber harvesting. In 1902, he vowed to oppose, \"the ruthless waste of material, and ... the stripping of the timber from those lands which are of little value for anything but forest growth\".\nChamberlain held multiple offices in the AMC. In 1901, he was elected head of the Exploration and Forestry committee. In 1904, he served as Vice President of the club. In 1906, he was elected club President, an office he occupied for just one year. In 1907, he was again elected head of the Exploration and Forestry committee.\nDuring his tenure at the AMC, Chamberlain was responsible for promoting responsible forest management, maintaining and expanding the club reservations, and lobbying for government protection of New England forests. Perhaps the high point came in 1911, when Congress passed the Weeks Act enabling the subsequent formation of the White Mountain National Forest in 1918. Chamberlain is widely cited as one of the most vocal advocates for the Weeks Act.\n\n\n== Hiking trails ==\nIn 1916, Chamberlain was a leading organizer of the New England Trail Conference (NETC), a confederation of hiking clubs across New England. The stated purpose of the NETC was to, \"promote cooperation in the creation and maintenance of a system of connecting trails in New England,\" but for Chamberlain the NETC was a means to an end. His goal was to form, \"a political base for support of wise, long-range forestry practices.\"\nThe NETC was most active from 1917 through the 1920s. During this period, several long-distance hiking trails were proposed and at least partially blazed. Most famously, Benton MacKaye proposed the Appalachian Trail in 1921. Chamberlain himself had a role in creating two smaller trails: the Wapack Trail and the Monadnock-Sunapee Greenway.\nChamberlain was also a promoter of hiking trails across New England. He wrote two books to guide fellow hikers, or as he called them, \"trampers\". In Vacation Tramps in New England Highlands (1919), he described several long-distance hiking trails crossing the higher peaks of New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine. In The Annals of the Grand Monadnock (1936), Chamberlain delved deeply into the history of trail building on Mount Monadnock.\n\n\n== Books ==\nVacation Tramps in New England Highlands (1919)\nBeacon Hill: Its Ancient Pastures and Early Mansions (1925)\nThe Annals of the Grand Monadnock (1936)\nPigeon Cove: Its Early Settlers and Their Farms (1940)\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nThe Chamberlain-Reynolds Memorial Forest, in Center Harbor, New Hampshire, is named for Chamberlain and his colleague Harris Reynolds.\nIn 1949, the Friends of Monadnock dedicated a memorial to  Chamberlain and his colleague Philip W. Ayres. The memorial is located at the start of the White Dot trail on Mount Monadnock. A plaque on the memorial remembers both men for laboring, \"with many others to place Monadnock under protective ownership\".\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nFoster, Charles H.W. (1998).

        "content": "The Missing Partner, or the Swagman is a 1904 Australian play by Edward Irham Cole. The play was set in the world of mining.\nThe play was part of the Australian \"bushranging play\" boom of the 1900s.\nIt debuted in 1904 and was revived several times by Cole including seasons in 1906 and 1907. Cole usually played the lead character, called \"The Unknown\".\nThe Sydney Morning Herald said \"The piece is interesting and exciting, with a strong vein of humour running through it.\"\nOne review said \"it gives a vivid insight into mining life in Australia. The principal characters were well interpreted by Misses Linden and Cole, and Messrs. Cole, Ayr, and Phillips. The\nmounting was adequate, and Mr. Gray's orchestra supplied some spirited music.\"\n\n\n== Premise ==\n\"The overseer of the Carleton homestead is a picturesque figure, called among the station hands \"The Unknown.\" He saves Alma Carleton from accident when her horse is bolting for the river. Barry Graham allows the mother to believe he saved Alma. Graham robs Mrs. Carleton of some jewels, and circumstances point to 'The Unknown\" as the culprit. Graham \"bails up\" a coach, disguised as \"The Unknown\" who is blamed for it until the mystery is cleared up by \"Old Mat,\" a swagman, who wanders through the early portion of the drama in a demented state, but finally recovers his reason and solves the problem of \"The Unknown\".\"\n\n\n== References ==",

The bridge has four traffic lanes, two in each direction, and a four metre wide shared pedestrian and cycle path.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe bridge was proposed to reduce congestion on the existing Nijmegen road bridge, the Waalbrug, 2 km (1.2 mi) east of the new bridge. However concerns were raised on the planned location, as it might attract wider regional traffic, thereby increasing congestion levels. After a review, building commenced in early 2011 and took 30 months to complete, the project jointly undertaken by the Dutch BAM Civie and the German Max Bögl.\nIt is the longest single arch bridge in Europe and cost an estimated €260 million. It was officially opened on 23 November 2013.\n\n\n=== Commemorating 1944 ===\nThe bridge is on the site of the Waal crossing of 20 September 1944, an assault across the river by soldiers of the US 504th Parachute Infantry during Operation Market Garden. The bridge was named after this event, which in Dutch is known as De Oversteek.\nThe 1944 crossing has remained a theme of the bridge. During the opening ceremony, veterans of the assault and their relatives were present, and tributes were paid to those who died.\nSince 19 October 2014, a daily Sunset March has taken place across the bridge. Led by a military veteran, the bridge's 48 street lights light up one by one at the pace of the march, in tribute to the 48 soldiers who died in the crossing.\nSince 2016, the road over the bridge has been called the Generaal James Gavinsingel, and the viaduct on the north side the 82e Airborne Divisieviaduct, named after the commander and formation of the 1944 assault troops.\n\n\n== See also ==\nWaalbrug\nList of bridges in the Netherlands\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External link ==",

Cole wrote several works about bushrangers such as Ned Kelly and Ben Hall. This was about a fictional bushranger and his brother. The play appears to have been less popular than Cole's work based on real bushrangers although it was performed by Cole's company over a number of years.\nThe Sydney Morning Herald said \"The drama abounds in realism, sensationalism, pathos, and humour, and is well mounted.\"\nThe play's debut production followed that of another Cole work The Missing Partner.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Kate Mantilini was a restaurant in Beverly Hills, California, at 9101 Wilshire Boulevard at the corner of Doheny Drive, two blocks from the headquarters of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences. Harry and Marilyn Lewis opened the restaurant in March 1987 after selling the Hamburger Hamlet restaurant chain for $33 million. (Harry was an ex-actor who had appeared in the film Key Largo. It was described as a \"late night hot spot\" and as the \"most consistently cool restaurant in Beverly Hills\". Starting in 2010, sons David and Adam Lewis took over the management, with Adam serving as executive chef.\n\n\n== Patronage by people in the entertainment industry ==\nRegular patrons included, reportedly, Mel Brooks, Ronald Reagan, Tony Curtis, and Sammy Davis, Jr. According to Pete Hammond of Deadline Hollywood:\"It was almost impossible to go in there and not run into someone you know. It was really a hopping place, both at lunch, dinner and late night. And it not only has been host to numerous premiere parties (including several for Matt Weiner and Mad Men, a Marilyn Lewis obsession) it was also prominently featured in the movie Heat with a key scene between stars Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, now memorialized on the walls of Kate's. I was even in there after the Oscars and a winner with his brand new shiny statuette came in passing up the Vanity Fair party in favor of a late night snack at Kate's.\nAccording to Los Angeles magazine, a \"representative\" of Harry Lewis said that Marilyn Lewis had an uncle named Rob who was a \"philanderer\", and had a mistress named Kate Mantilini, after whom the Lewises named the restaurant.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nThe menue stated \"We thank Musso and Frank, Ollie Hammonds and Armstrong Schroeder for the inspiration for this menu\". According to the \"Reluctant Gourmet\", an anonymous restaurant critic at the Los Angeles Times, the menue was \"straightforward, huge and very American\". American classic dishes served included shrimp cocktail, clams casino, meat loaf, crab cakes, Greek salad, fish, steak, broiled pork chops, rotisserie chicken, macaroni and cheese, and chili. Desserts included apple pie, cake, and shortcake. The restaurant also served breakfast and were open until 3 am.\n\n\n== Filming location ==\nKate Mantilini served as a set for the 1995 movie Heat starring Robert DeNiro.\n\n\n== Epilogue ==\nThe landlord raised the rent on the location, which Adam Lewis stated they couldn't afford, and so the restaurant closed after 27 years on June 14, 2014, though another location remained open in Woodland Hills (5921 Owensmouth Avenue) in the San Fernando Valley.\nHarry Lewis died in 2013.\nMarilyn Lewis wrote about the Lewis family's history in the restaurant business in a book titled Marilyn, Are You Sure You Can Cook?\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMenu from Kate Mantilini",

In the previous election, Labour won 17 seats (up 1) with 64.4% of the vote, the Liberal Democrats won 1 with 9.9%, and the Conservatives lost the seat they were defending with 16.0%.\nThe 2021 election took place on new boundaries, with all seats being elected. Because of this, the seats up for election in 2024 are those held by the candidates who won first place in each ward in that election. Labour are defending 16 seats, and the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives are defending 1 seat each.\n\n\n== Previous council composition ==\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== Ward Results ==\nAn asterisk denotes an incumbent councillor.\n\n\n=== Appleton ===\n\n\n=== Bankfield ===\n\n\n=== Beechwood & Heath ===\n\n\n=== Birchfield ===\n\n\n=== Bridgewater ===\n\n\n=== Central & West Bank ===\n\n\n=== Daresbury, Moore & Sandymoor ===\n\n\n=== Ditton, Hale Village & Halebank ===\n\n\n=== Farnworth ===\n\n\n=== Grange ===\n\n\n=== Halton Castle ===\n\n\n=== Halton Lea ===\n\n\n=== Halton View ===\n\n\n=== Highfield ===\n\n\n=== Hough Green ===\n\n\n=== Mersey & Weston ===\n\n\n=== Norton North ===\n\n\n=== Norton South & Preston Brook ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Homemade is an album by the American musical duo Cephas & Wiggins, released in 1999. It was their second album for Alligator Records. The duo supported the album with a North American tour. Homemade was nominated for a W. C. Handy Award for best \"Traditional Blues Album\".\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe album was produced by Joe Wilson, who also cowrote a couple of the songs. Cephas helped write eight of the songs; Wiggins worked on one. Wiggins considered the selections to be enlivening rather than sad or depressing. The album opens and closes with covers of Blind Boy Fuller tunes. \"Slow Blues\" is a version of the instrumental Reverend Gary Davis song. Two originals, \"Jelly Roll\" and \"Meeting the Mule\", explore the differences between life, and women, in the metropolitan North and country South. \"I Was Determined\" is an autobiographical song about wanting to play the blues after hearing neighbors singing blues standards.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that \"Cephas plays in ragtime-like guitar rhythms, with Wiggins's airy harp a perfect complement... Cephas's vocals are fittingly light, even though the blues are still the blues.\" The Sunday Age said that Cephas \"succeeds where few have dared, mimicking Skip James's keening vocals and unusual tuning on 'Illinois'.\" The Toronto Star deemed the album \"accessible rural dance music with low-key engaging grooves.\" The Washington Post determined that Wiggins and Cephas weave \"voice and guitar together so seamlessly that one mind seems to govern both mouths and all four arms.\" The Star Democrat considered the album forgettable and an example of \"generic\" blues.\nAllMusic noted the \"rustic, laid-back charm.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mandy Marie James-Morgan (born 9 December 1978) is a retired American rhythmic gymnast and stuntwoman. She was part of the national senior group.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nShe was on the US national rhythmic gymnastics team from 1995 to 1996, being part of the national senior group along Kate Nelson, Lori Fredreickson, Aliane Baquerot, Ginny Ledgerwood, Becky Turner, Brandi Siegel and Challen Sievers. They all lived together in suburban Chicago largely due to Sievers’ father, Ron, whose construction firm renovated the house where the gymnasts lived and converted a former racquetball complex into the gym where they trained. They won silver at the 1995 Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, and placed second in the group at the 1995 Four Continents Championships.\nIn the summer of 1996 Mandy, Aliane Baquerot, Kate Nelson, Becky Turner, Brandi Siegel and Challen Sievers were selected to compete at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, the first edition to feature the group competition. They finished in 9th place and so did not advance to the final.\nAfter her retirement James entered the film and television industry, where she worked as a stuntperson, appearing in multiple movies.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Stratford Quaker Store is a historic home and business that is the oldest standing residence in Stratford, New Jersey, United States, and the only surviving structure of what was once the village of White Horse.\n\n\n== Background ==\nA general store has been present at this intersection as early as the 1740s. The original structure was eventually demolished and its wood repurposed to construct an addition to the neighboring White Horse Tavern, for which the village of White Horse was named (as well as the road, White Horse Pike).\nBy 1845, the present building is believed to have been erected on the same foundation as the 1743 store. Oral history suggests the establishment was known as \"Scroggey's Little Red Store\" in the late 19th century, before operating as a restaurant called \"George's Place\" from 1910 to 1925.\nIn 1937, Elizabeth Strippoli purchased the building and began operating a general store again, living on the second floor until her death in 1997. Throughout the late 20th century, it was called the \"General Store\" or \"Strippoli's.\" The present name arose after the Strippolis joined a grocery cooperative, which required the placement of a \"Quaker\" sign for the sale of Quaker Oats.\nIn the 1960s, the lot was split and a gas station installed behind the store.\n\n\n== Preservation ==\nIn 1996, the building was identified as potentially eligible for the National Register of Historic Place (NRHP) and the New Jersey Register of Historic Places (NJR). Following Mrs. Strippoli's death in 1997, Exxon attempted to demolish the building but was blocked by the town. In 2000, Stratford Borough obtained a grant to renovate and restore the old store, which continued for several years. \nIn 2004, a county-level historic architectural survey determined the building was not eligible under Criteria A-C of the NRHP; however, its archaeological significance (Criteria D) was not assessed. The same architectural survey listed the Ephraim and Sarah Tomlinson House (also in Stratford) as ineligible, but it was reassessed in 2019 and listed on the NRHP/NJR. Additionally, the survey was conducted before the building was fully restored. Following the restoration, and with so few historic buildings left in Stratford, the Quaker Store has since become a rallying point for the community. The NJHPO database continues to list the property as \"not assessed.\" \nSince restoration, however, the building has remained vacant and seen little further development. In 2023, the Strippoli family put it up for sale, and both lots were sold to a developer.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== Related ==\nList of the oldest buildings in New Jersey\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Camden County, New Jersey\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "St. Paul Lutheran Church and Cemetery is a historic Lutheran church and adjoining cemetery located in Brule Township, rural Union County, South Dakota. It is located near Richland and about 5 miles (8.0 km) northwest of Elk Point. First built in 1867, it was the first Norwegian Lutheran church in Dakota Territory.: 16  The cemetery dates to 1869 and the current church building was finished in 1922. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 20, 2018, for its historic, religious, and architectural significance.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe establishment of St. Paul Lutheran Church grew out of the first Lutheran movement in Dakota Territory. The first Lutheran minister, Abraham Jacobson, arrived from Iowa in 1861, and the first official district was established in 1863 as the Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Church of Dakota Territory. On August 12 of that year, 15 Norwegian settlers founded the Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Church by Brule Creek. The district was divided into three parishes in 1866; Brule Creek parish was renamed first to Evangelical Lutheran Church by Brule Creek, and then finally to St. Paul Evangelical Lutheran Congregation in Dakota: 14  on November 15, 1867.\nThe church site was chosen during an expedition led by Kjel P. Ronne. Ronne and two other men set out from Vermillion and travelled north as far as Sioux Falls before turning back south. The site near the convergence of Brule Creek with the Missouri River was chosen due to its landmark location and proximity to a natural wood for timber.\nThe first church building sat on the east side of 475th Avenue. Construction on the log structure began in 1867 and concluded in 1868. In 1869, the cemetery was established around the building. Several former pastors of the church are buried there, and a monument to the first church site was erected in 1938.: 14, 16  John N. Nesse, St. Paul's first pastor, built the first parsonage on his personal property between 1869 and 1870, about 0.75 miles (1.21 km) south of the church site. By 1877, a new church building was being constructed where the current church now sits. The Lutheran parish was incorporated in 1878. The second church building was dedicated in 1881.: 14  The church itself built a new parsonage in 1891, which was replaced in 1947. All services were first conducted in Norwegian, with English being introduced later; Norwegian language services were discontinued in 1923.: 16 \nThe area's Lutheran congregation grew rapidly, and a second church building, the North St. Paul Church, had to be constructed to accommodate the parishioners.: 14–15  It was built in 1893 about 6 miles (9.7 km) northeast of the main church, North St. Paul Church operated until 1932. St. Paul counted 450 parishioners in 1919, and by that time, it had again outgrown its two sites.: 14–15 \nPeter Oliver Moe, a Norwegian-American architect from Minneapolis, was hired to design a new church building. Minneapolis-based contractor R. S. Billingsley was hired to oversee construction. Construction officially commenced on September 26, 1920, with the installment of the cornerstone, and was complete by July 1922. The total construction cost was $85,000; its pipe organ alone cost $5,000. August Klagstad, a Norwegian-born artist, painted the altar piece for the church; it is one of about 1,000 such pieces painted by Klagstad in Norwegian American churches.: 15, 17 \nThe church purchased 158 acres (64 ha) of farmland to the south of the property in 1960, which is used to fundraise for the church.: 16  The church hosts an annual lutefisk dinner.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Church ===\nMoe incorporated elements of Late Gothic Revival, particularly Collegiate Gothic, architecture into his church design. It is two stories tall and constructed of brick. A raised basement sits underneath the church. Its front facade faces east, towards 475th Avenue, and contains two large towers on either corner, which both have entrance doors. Its roof is a steep-pitched gable constructed from sheet metal, topped with a parapet. The church contains several stained-glass windows original to the 1922 construction.\n\n\n=== Cemetery ===\nSt. Paul Cemetery was established in 1869. Its wrought-iron and brick gate was built in 1930, and it is surrounded by a chain link and wire fence. There are about 25 rows of graves running from north to south, with a single east–west pathway bisecting the cemetery. A stone boulder near the gate contains a two plaques: one commemorating the site of the first church, and another listing the 1863 founding members.\n\n\n== Pastors ==\nAn incomplete list of former pastors of St. Paul Lutheran Church is as follows:: 16 \n\n1868–1881: John Nesse, first resident pastor\n1896–1918: R. J. Reinertsen, longest-serving pastor\n1958–1959: Thomas A. Knudson (interim)\n1973–1986: Arthur Erickson\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of cemeteries in South Dakota\nNorwegian Americans\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nSaint Paul Cemetery at Find a Grave",

An asphalt road leads to the place from road 899 (the northern road), about 100 meters east of the settlement of Gornot HaGalil.\n\n\n== Archeology ==\nIn the years 2000–2001, excavation were conducted as the Israel Antiquities Authority started a project to preserve and restore the some of the finding in the site. Five oil presses for the production of olive oil on were found in the ruins implying that the settlement's economy was based on oil production. After the excavation walls, thresholds and the oil presses were restored, alleys were opened and a circular route was prepared for touring of the ruins.\nFrom the place there is a marked walking path in Nahal Sarach that reaches the Sarach Cave and Nahal Betzet. There is a memorial site for the Ma'ale Yosef Regional Council soldiers and civilians who fell in the wars of Israel.",

It was the 4th edition of Paris–Roubaix Femmes and the 11th event of the 2024 UCI Women's World Tour. \nHeld in unseasonably warm weather, the race was won by Belgian rider Lotte Kopecky of Team SD Worx–Protime in a sprint finish. The overall average speed for the race was 39.12 kilometres per hour (24.31 mph).\n\n\n== Route ==\nStarting in Denain, the race finished on the velodrome in Roubaix after covering 148.5 kilometres (92.3 mi), with 29.2 kilometres (18.1 mi) of cobblestones, spread out over 17 sectors. The women covered the same final 17 sectors as the men's race.\n\nOrganisers maintained that they consider it \"too dangerous\" to include the five-star cobbled sector Trouée d'Arenberg due to its proximity to the start in Denain, having previously noted that they \"do not rule out that we will pass through ... in the future\".\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Teams ==\n24 teams took part in the race.

        "content": "Wilmer Worthington MacElree (December 17, 1859 – January 16, 1960) was an American lawyer and author of Along the Western Brandywine and other books on the history and natural environment of Chester County, Pennsylvania. He served as Chester County district attorney for six years.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nMacElree was born on December 17, 1859, in West Chester, Pennsylvania. His parents were Mariah (née Buffington) and James MacElree. His Irish-born father had immigrated to Pennsylvania in 1827 and settled in West Chester in 1852; his mother belonged to an old local family. MacElree attended public schools in West Chester, read law with John J. Pinkerton, and gained admittance to the county bar in 1880.\nMacElree founded the law firm of MacElree Harvey, Ltd., which is still extant, and practiced law in West Chester until his retirement in 1956. He served as Chester County district attorney from 1897 to 1900 and again from 1906 to 1909. He defended six of the men who allegedly lynched Zachariah Walker in 1911. In his reminiscences, MacElree called the victim a \"worthless negro from Virginia.\" As \"the legal sage of Chester County,\" MacElree's defense role was instrumental in obtaining the acquittals from the jury.\nA member of the Republican Party, MacElree ran for judge of the Pennsylvania Courts of Common Pleas but lost the election in a landslide to two-term incumbent Joseph Hemphill in 1909. Hemphill had received the endorsement of the Democratic Party and the backing of many Republicans in the election.\nAn enthusiastic amateur historian, MacElree lectured widely and published privately at least four books and many \"sentimental\" sketches and essays about the events, people, landmarks, and natural environment of Chester County. Active in the Westminster Presbyterian Church and serving ten years as a deacon in the First Presbyterian Church of West Chester, he helped to establish Sunday schools across the county.\nOn January 18, 1884, MacElree married Ella Eyre of West Chester. They had three children, two of whom survived to adulthood. Their son, James Paul MacElree, attended the University of Pennsylvania, joined his father's law firm in 1908, and served as presiding judge of the Chester County Orphan's Court.\nThe elder MacElree died of heart disease in East Bradford Township, Pennsylvania, on January 16, 1960, at the age of 100. He was interred at Oaklands Cemetery just outside West Chester.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nAs an author, MacElree was well known in Chester County. Berenice Ball enjoyed MacElree's walks Along the Western Brandywine and travels Around the Boundaries of Chester County (1934), which constituted \"fascinating-to-read forays into Chester County's past along Indian Trails, streams and early thoroughfares.\" Side Lights on the Bench and Bar of Chester County (1918) received praise from historian Charles William Heathcote, who declared that MacElree had \"contributed materially to legal history\" and observed that the book showed evidence of \"a careful study of court records and an intimate knowledge of the characters of leading lawyers and judges from the organization of the court to the early years of the present century.\"\n\nMacElree, Wilmer W.

        "content": "Aliane Mata-Baquerot (born 23 November 1978), known as Aliane Baquerot, is a retired American rhythmic gymnast. She was part of the national senior group.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nShe was on the US national rhythmic gymnastics team from 1995 to 1996, being part of the national senior group along Kate Nelson, Lori Fredreickson, Mandy James, Ginny Ledgerwood, Becky Turner, Brandi Siegel and Challen Sievers. They all lived together in suburban Chicago largely due to Sievers’ father, Ron, whose construction firm renovated the house where the gymnasts lived and converted a former racquetball complex into the gym where they trained. They won silver at the 1995 Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, and placed second in the group at the 1995 Four Continents Championships.\nIn the summer of 1996 Aliane, Mandy James, Kate Nelson, Becky Turner, Brandi Siegel and Challen Sievers were selected to compete at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, the first edition to feature the group competition. They finished in 9th place and so did not advance to the final.\nAfter her retirement Baquerot worked in Las Vegas with Cirque du Soleil, among her other performing credits. She married Olympic medalist Blaine Wilson, the couple were both performing on The Tour of Gymnastics Superstars, and after their stop in Sacramento, traveled to Reno, Nevada, and married there. Blaine and Aliane have two sons, Jackson and Bodhi. Alaine currently resides in Columbus where she works in her husband's gymnastics, cheerleading, and volleyball training facility, Integrity Athletics, in Plain City, Ohio.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Richard Davies (1635 – April 1708) was a Welsh quaker.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nDavies was born in 1635 at Welshpool, where his family had a fair estate, and received his education in that town. Although brought up to the episcopal church, when only thirteen years old he began to go to dissenters' meetings, and used to follow one independent minister when he preached at considerable distances. When fourteen he was sent, preliminary to being apprenticed, on trial to a tradesman, but a single conversation proving that his destined master's religious views were not ‘right,’ he returned home, and waited until he met with a felt-maker of whose opinions he approved, to whom he apprenticed himself. In 1657 he met with a person who professed quaker principles, and, without joining that body, Davies broke off his connection with the independents, and adopted the quaker forms of speech and customs, for using which his mistress once broke his head and, as he alleged, tried to murder him. Shortly before the termination of his apprenticeship he visited Welshpool, and, going with his parents to church, interrupted the preacher, for which he was arrested, but discharged by the magistrates, as his offence was not sufficient to constitute legal brawling. Finding three other men of like mind, he commenced to worship with them on a hillside in quaker fashion, for which he was avoided, and underwent some petty persecution. \nOn the termination of his apprenticeship in 1658–9 he went to live in London, joining the Friends, among whom he soon became a minister, and working at his trade of felt-maker or hatter. About the same time he married. Towards the end of 1660, while on a visit to Welshpool, he was arrested in the middle of the night, on a charge of being inimical to the government, by some soldiers. The magistrates, to whom he was known, interfered in his behalf, and as the soldiers refused to liberate him, a crowd collected, and abetted by the magistrates made preparations for a riot. On Davies promising to surrender himself at Montgomery prison the next morning, the soldiers let him go. This promise he kept, on his way avoiding, he relates, going near the house of an uncle, a magistrate, who he feared might prevent him. He was only imprisoned, though with great severity, for a fortnight, when he went to a meeting at which, with twenty-five others, he was arrested and sent to the gaol at Shrewsbury. On condition of promising that these prisoners should all appear at the next assizes, he, after a few days, obtained their release, for which, as it was harvest time, he was particularly anxious. At the assizes they were discharged on condition of returning home at once. As a minister Davies was so successful that in the course of a few years the greater part of the inhabitants for miles round Welshpool professed quakerism. His converts were severely persecuted, and Davies, whose influence was considerable, was instrumental in relieving the wants of those who were confined in overcrowded prisons, as well as in obtaining the release of a large number. Among other magistrates he visited the third Lord Herbert of Cherbury, who asked the clergyman introducing him who he was. The other replied, ‘A quaker and a haberdasher of hats.’ ‘Oh,’ said Lord Herbert, ‘I thought he was such an one, for he keeps his hat so fast on the block.’ Lord Herbert refused to use his influence to liberate the Friends altogether, but obtained for them so much liberty that they were allowed to leave the prison and go where they liked so long as they did not return to their homes, and Davies seems to have been instrumental in providing a house for their use. \nIn 1662 he was again arrested at Welshpool, but was offered his liberty if he would consent to go to church the following Sunday, which he accepted, and insisted on speaking both during the morning and evening service. He, however, always spoke with so much courtesy that he generally parted on friendly terms with the preachers he interrupted, and many of his closest friends were ministers whom he opposed. In his ‘Account of the Convincement,’ &c., he states that he was for the next ten years nominally a prisoner under a writ of præmunire, but he was put under no restraint of any kind, and, although during these years, which he occupied as a travelling minister, he was frequently arrested, he was never detained more than a few hours. On one of his journeys he made the acquaintance of Thomas Corbet, a barrister, of whose legal knowledge he made such use as to obtain the liberation of numbers of imprisoned Friends. From this time the relief and liberation of the suffering quakers seems to have been his real business, and he never hesitated to urge them to take any advantage a faulty writ or technical error might afford. In 1680, while he was in London, a writ of excommunication was issued against him. He immediately returned to Wales, and called on Dr. Lloyd, the bishop of St. Asaph, who offered to annul the writ, an offer Davies declined until the bishop agreed to include all the other Friends who were in like condition. In his ‘Account’ he gives a very amusing narrative of an interview he had on behalf of imprisoned Friends with Lord Hyde at Whitehall, and of another with Earl Powys, who, he records, never allowed the quakers to be fined for not serving on juries, or otherwise offending for conscience sake, in any places where he had influence. He seems to have been on most friendly terms with several of the bishops and the more important clergy, and to have been almost always successful in persuading them to exercise their influence on behalf of the Friends. In 1702 he was one of the twelve quakers sent by the yearly meeting to present an address to the queen and to have acted as spokesman, after which he returned to Wales, going round by Worcester in order to stop with his firm friend Dr. Lloyd, who had been translated to that see from St. Asaph. Davies visited London again in 1704 and 1706 to be present at the yearly meetings. \nHe died after a very brief illness in April 1708, and was interred in the Friends' burying-place near his house at Cloddiechion, near Welshpool. He was a recognised minister for forty-five years. He was a man of amiable disposition, of considerable gift in preaching, kind-hearted, charitable, and unpretending, with considerable tact and foresight. His only work is ‘An Account of the Convincement, Exercises, and Services of that Ancient Servant of the Lord, R. D.,’ &c., 1710, which has been frequently republished in England and America.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Henderson, Thomas Finlayson (1886). \"Davies, Richard (1635-1708)\".

His father claimed kinship with the ducal family of Norfolk; in 1750 he sold Overacres, the seigniories of Redesdale and Harbottle, and the advowson of Elsdon, Northumberland, to the Earl of Northumberland, and thenceforward appears to have been supported by Edward Howard, 9th Duke of Norfolk. Walter was sent by the duke to the college at St. Omer, but, being a Protestant, he was soon withdrawn. In 1773 he was placed with a wine merchant at Oporto. In 1777 his father and the duke died. He returned to England, and found that Duke Edward had bequeathed him an annuity of 45l. The new duke, Charles Howard, 10th Duke of Norfolk, became his friend, and continued the allowance previously made to his father. In 1793 he was much embarrassed by debts. The eleventh duke, Charles, seems to have satisfied himself from a pedigree in the College of Arms that Howard's claims to kinship with him were fictitious. On 21 December 1795 Howard was released from a debtors' prison, and by the duke's steward established at Ewood, Surrey, on a small property. The duke ordered him to be called ‘Mr. Smith.’ When he went to London to complain of this grievance, the duke refused to see him, and would not allow him to resume occupation of Ewood. Howard now devoted himself to correct the College of Arms pedigree of the ducal family, and to regain the Ewood property. He wrote to the lord chancellor, and tried to address the court of chancery in July 1809, and even attempted to address the House of Lords. Thomas Christopher Banks wrote a foolish pamphlet in his support, and drew up for him a petition to the king. Howard presented a petition to the prince regent on 25 April 1812, and waylaid the prince in Pall Mall on 12 May, for which he apologised in another letter. He was taken into custody on presenting himself at Norfolk House, and, after examination before a magistrate, was committed to prison. He obtained some allowance from the twelfth duke, Bernard Edward, and is believed to have died in 1830 or 1831. By his wife, Miss Jane Martin of Gateside, Westmoreland, he left no issue.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Goodwin, Gordon (1891). \"Howard, Walter\".

He was appointed chaplain to the Earl of Hillsborough, and in August 1769 he obtained the rectory of Igtham, Kent, which he vacated in 1773, probably from pecuniary embarrassments, for he figures among the bankrupts of that year.

        "content": "Seta Kabranian-Melkonian (Armenian: Սեդա Գպրանյան-Մելքոնյան; b. 1963) is an Armenian-American writer and refugee rights activist. Born in Lebanon, Kabranian moved to Yerevan to study Armenian literature. She met and married Monte Melkonian, who died fighting in the First Nagorno-Karabakh War. She established a non-governmental organization in his name, to provide aid to families of Armenian soldiers and refugees. She later moved to Alaska, where she studied creative nonfiction, contributed to research on refugees and worked as a faculty member of the University of Alaska Anchorage.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSeta Kabranian was born in the Lebanese Armenian town of Anjar, in 1963. One of six daughters, Kabranian was born into a family that had survived the Armenian genocide.\nWhen she was fifteen, Kabranian met Monte Melkonian, who at the time was fighting in the Lebanese Civil War as a member of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA). In 1981, Kabranian moved to Yerevan, in the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR), where she studied Armenian literature at Yerevan State University. After spending 1983–1985 in hiding with Melkonian in Europe, and staying in Lebanon and the United States for a short period, Kabranian returned to Armenia to stay. She graduated as a Master of Arts during the time of the ASSR, and later graduated as a Doctor of Philosophy after the restoration of the Armenian Republic.\nFollowing the Armenian declaration of independence, in 1991, Kabranian and Melkonian married at the monastery of Geghard. Melkonian died two years later, while fighting in the First Nagorno-Karabakh War. After the war's conclusion, Kabranian established the Monte Melkonian Fund, to aid the families of soldiers that were wounded or killed in action. Kabranian began to express distaste with the social stratification that had taken place in Armenia after the war, noting the stark divide between the Armenians living in poverty and the rich members of the diaspora, the latter of whom had brought with them a culture of luxury cars and casinos. American journalist Thomas Goltz noted that Kabranian sympathised more with Azeri victims of the First Nagorno-Karabakh War than those that had come to dominate the economy of Armenia.\nAfter her work for a refugee aid NGO, Kabranian moved to the United States. There she began studying creative nonfiction at the University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA), graduating as a Master of Fine Arts. She continues to work at UAA as a teacher, and is an affiliate editor for The Alaska Quarterly Review. She has also continued her activism in refugee aid, as president of the Society for Orphaned Armenian Relief in Anchorage.\n\n\n== Academic work ==\nIn her academic research, Kabranian has pursued her interest in refugee rights and social justice. Together with Monte's brother Markar Melkonian, Kabranian co-authored My Brother's Road, a book about Monte Melkonian which was published in 2005 by I. B. Tauris. In 2017, Kabranian herself published The Consecrated Ones, a book about the life of Garlen Ananian written in the Armenian language. She has also published works in the magazine Hetq and the literary magazines Iknagir and Atticus Review.\nIn 2015, Kabranian published an article on \"Ethical Concerns with Refugee Research\". Defining a \"refugee\" as a person that has been forcibly displaced from their country of origin due to natural disasters, persecution or war, Kabranian found that the total number of refugees experienced an exponential growth during the first two decades of the 21st century. In her research, Kabranian employed a methodological pluralism, which combined quantitative and qualitative research on the subject. She demonstrated that obtaining refugee status provides many opportunities, including the improvement of living conditions and the recognition of their fundamental rights, irrespective of different laws on refugee status in different countries of destination.\nIn the wake of the displacement of Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh in 2023, Kabranian was among dozens of Armenian academics that called for the international community to aid the displaced refugees and take action against what they described as an act of ethnic cleansing by Azerbaijan.\n\n\n== Selected work ==\nBooks\n\nJournal articles\n\nWeb articles\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==",

He was born in 1696, matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford, 16 August 1712, proceeded B.A. 1716, M.A. 1719, and became fellow of his college 1722. Abandoning an intention of taking holy orders, he was, on 27 October 1721, appointed wardrobe-keeper and keeper of the private lodgings at Hampton Court. He subsequently resided at Headly Park, Hampshire. He died 2 July 1761.\nHuggins published: \n\n'Judith, an Oratorio or Sacred Drama; the Music composed by Mr. William Fesche, late Chapel Master of the Cathedral Church at Antwerp,' London, 1733, 8vo.\nTranslation of sonnets from the Italian of Giovanni Battista Felice Zappa, 1755, 4to.\n'The Observer Observ'd; or Remarks on a certain curious Tract intitled \"Observations on the Faiere [sic] Queene of Spencer,\" by Thomas Warton,' London, 1756, 8vo.\n'Orlando Furioso . . . translated from the Italian,' 2 vols., London, 1757, 4to. This has an elaborate preface and annotations.This translation has been erroneously attributed to Huggins; it is the work of Temple Henry Croker. Huggins only supplied the annotations. At his death he left in manuscript a tragedy, a farce, and a translation of Dante, of which the 'British Magazine,' 1760, published a specimen. His portrait was both painted and engraved by William Hogarth, and was to have been prefixed to the translation of Dante.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Bayne, Ronald (1891). \"Huggins, William (1696-1761)\".

        "content": "Tony Heard, full name Anthony Hazlitt Heard, (20 November 1937 – 27 March 2024) was a South African journalist, author and government advisor. He is best known for his journalism covering apartheid, most notably interviewing African National Congress (ANC) leader Oliver Tambo in 1985 at a time when it was banned by the South African government. After the country's transition to a new democratic South Africa, Heard became an adviser in the presidency, serving until 2010.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHe was born on 20 November 1937 in Johannesburg, South Africa, to George and Vida Heard, both journalists. His brother, Raymond Heard, is a noted Canadian journalist. His father was a noted anti-fascist political journalist at a time when fascism was on the rise globally in the run-up to World War II. South Africa's entry into the war on the side of the Allies was controversial in country where significant pro-fascist feelings were present among Afrikaner nationalists. His father mysteriously disappeared in 1945; the Heard family believes he was murdered for his political beliefs.\nHeard matriculated from Durban Boys High in 1954, after which he spent a year in London learning shorthand and typing. In 1955 he returned to South Africa and started work as a journalist while studying journalism part-time at the University of Cape Town, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts.\n\n\n== Career ==\nFollowing his return to South Africa in 1955, Heard was employed as a journalist at the Cape Times in Cape Town. He became a parliamentary reporter for the Cape Times in 1958 and then a political correspondent.\nHeard covered the anti-pass march in Langa, Cape Town, led by Pan Africanist Congress leader Philip Kgosana on 30 March 1960. He was appointed editor of the Cape Times in 1971.\n\n\n=== Tambo interview ===\nIn 1985 Heard took leave and traveled to the United Kingdom where he interviewed the then banned leader of the ANC, Oliver Tambo.\nHis interview with Tambo was published in the Cape Times under the heading \"A Conversation with Oliver Tambo of the ANC,” was an important event in South African history. It allowed the ANC to articulate its vision of a non-racial South Africa to the public, thereby alleviate fears held by White South Africans for a post-apartheid South Africa, and ultimately helped created the political conditions for the negotiated settlement that ended apartheid and established a non-racial democratic government.\nFollowing the interview Heard was arrested and released on bail for contravening the Internal Security Act with the case against him eventually being dropped by the government. He won the Golden Pen Award of Freedom from the World Association of Newspapers for the interview.\n\n\n=== Later career ===\nIn March 1986 Heard investigated and exposed the killing of seven anti-apartheid activists in Gugulethu known as the Gugulethu Seven. Heard was sacked from the Cape Times in 1987 after refusing a R1 million (equivalent to R14,653,000 in 2024) offer to resign that contained a clause that, Heard argued, would have effectively muzzled him following the Tambo interview.\nFollowing his departure from the Cape Times, Heard temporarily moved to the United States where he became a Nieman Fellow and was a Visiting Fulbright Fellow at University of Arkansas. After the transition to democracy, he served in the administration of Nelson Mandela as a senior official, first advising the Minister for Water Affairs, Kader Asmal and then later working in the presidency of the Thabo Mbeki administration.\n\n\n== Death ==\nHeard died in Cape Town following a brief illness on 24 March 2024.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n1985: Pringle Award from the South African Society of Journalists\n2022: Allan Kirkland Soga Lifetime Achievement Award at the Standard Bank Sikuvile Awards, organised by the South African National Editors' Forum (SANEF)\n\n\n== List of books ==\nThe Cape of Storms : a personal history of the crisis in South Africa.

In the church, that he had been a priest in for 8 years by the time of the interview, he wanted to get rid of hierarchies and only keep the one where people can be ranked by their age.

        "content": "OnlyKey is a multi-function hardware security key combining features of a password manager, two-factor authentication (2FA) token, file encryption token, and secure storage device. The device incorporates hardware storage for password and username combinations, also acting as a portable password manager.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nOnlyKey is notable for its physical keypad, which allows users to enter a PIN code directly on the device. After 10 failed attempts to unlock, all data is erased. The device also features a data-destruction code that the user can key in. The device can store passwords, usernames/URLs, and one-time password (OTP) accounts, that can be used for online/offline access.\n\n\n== Features ==\nPassword management: OnlyKey can store and manage up to 24 passwords, usernames/URLs, and one-time password (OTP) accounts on the device itself.\nTwo-factor authentication (2FA):  OnlyKey supports various 2FA protocols including FIDO2 WebAuthn, FIDO U2F, TOTP, Yubico OTP, and Challenge-response. When logging in to a configured website or service, besides entering the username and password, the user also physically confirms the login attempt  by pressing a button.\nSecurity and Durability: OnlyKey is open source and has upgradable firmware. \nSet up Apps: The device can be used via Chrome browser app, as well as desktop apps on macOS, Windows, and Linux (.deb)\n\n\n== Disadvantages ==\nCost:  Compared to software-based password managers, OnlyKey requires an upfront purchase for the hardware device itself.\nLearning Curve: Setting up and using OnlyKey may require familiarization with its features and functionalities compared to typical password management solutions. Complex setup process compared to security keys like YubiKey.\nPhysical Loss: Losing the OnlyKey device can potentially lock the user out of their accounts if no backup options are implemented.\nLimited Lockout Effectiveness: The PIN lockout feature can be bypassed by repeatedly removing and re-inserting the OnlyKey from the USB port, resetting the attempt counter. This is a potential weakness due to the lack of non-volatile memory on the device itself.\nLimited OTP Functionality: The absence of both an on-board clock and non-volatile memory necessitates the OnlyKey Chrome App to be running for Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) generation. There are some exceptions when the hardware key is continuously powered.\nPotential for accidental total data-destruction due to user's keying error.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Youth Symphony Orchestra of Ukraine (Молодіжний симфонічний оркестр України) is a Ukrainian national youth orchestra founded by conductor Oksana Lyniv in 2016. She has conducted the orchestra in major concerts halls and festivals in Europe.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Youth Symphony Orchestra of Ukraine (YSOU) was founded in 2016 by conductor Oksana Lyniv. A conductor with an international career, Lyniv was music director of the Oper Graz (appointed 2017) prior to becoming the first woman appointed music director of the Teatro Comunale di Bologna in 2022. She was trained at opera houses in Ukraine and at the Bavarian State Opera. The New York Times described her \"as something of a pioneer in a field still heavily dominated by men.\"Lyniv modeled the YSOU  after the Bundesjugendorchester, a German national youth orchestra. She founded the orchestra with the support of this orchestra, and the support of both the Beethovenfest in Bonn and the broadcaster Deutsche Welle. The first concerts were held in August 2017 together with the Bundesjugendorchester. This joint group played four concerts, in Lviv and Kyiv in Ukraine, and Bonn and Berlin in Germany. The performance in Lviv was part of the Mozart Festival LvivMozArt that Lyniv had founded, After the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the YSOU began an evacuation project for its musicians, called \"Music for the Future\". It was carried out in collaboration with the Slovenian Youth Orchestra in Ljubljana.  A concert tour that summer, name \"United for the future\", included around 30 concerts at ten music festivals in Austria, Germany and Switzerland, including Herbstgold in Eisenstadt, Bachfest Leipzig, Munich Opera Festival, Young Euro Classic in Berlin, and Lucerne Festival.The YSOU was accepted into the European Federation of National Youth Orchestras (EFNYO) in June 2022. The ensemble was awarded the 2022 Musikpreis der Stadt Duisburg from the Köhler-Osbahr Foundation, recognizing \"outstanding achievement in the field of music\". The Berlin Philharmonic became patron of the YSOU as well as of the Kyiv Symphony Orchestra in 2023.In 2023, Lyniv conducted the YSOU playing the German premiere of Odessa Rhapsody by Evgeni Orkin. This tone poem in four movements related to the city Odessa, was dedicated to Lyniv by the composer. It was first performed in Paris the previous year and had earned the composer the European Composer's Prize. The conductor contrasted the work with Beethoven's Fifth Symphony in a concert of Young Euro Classic at the Konzerthaus Berlin. Reviewer Eleonore Büning wrote for Der Tagesspiegel that the players were in \"professional top form\".As part of their Spring 2024 tour, the YSOU gave a concert at the Casals Forum of the Kronberg Academy. Lyniv and the YSOU began that concert with Maria's City by Ukrainian composer Zoltan Almashi; a work named for the city of Mariupol. It was followed by Ravel's Pavane pour une infante défunte, Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto, and Schumann's First Symphony. The solo violinist was Dmytro Udovychenko, a student of the Kronberg Academy. A reviewer from the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung noted \"lament, aggression and hope\" in the concise opening piece and a refreshing view on Mendelssohn's concerto.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"Building Musical Bridges: Founding Concert of the Youth Symphony Orchestra of Ukraine – Documentation\".

        "content": "A Living Commodity is the debut studio album by British post-punk band Egyptian Blue (band), released by independent label Yala Records on 27 October 2023.\n\n\n== Background and recording ==\nRecording of the debut album was contracted and planned to occur prior to 2020, but delayed following the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, with lead Andy Buss describing the album as evolving into a \"more fully shaped and finessed\" product over the course of the pandemic. In contrast to the band's previous EPs, Collateral Damage and Body of Itch, where songs were written and immediately recorded, Egyptian Blue wrote over thirty songs for the record, although included re-recordings of previous songs including Nylon Wire. Buss described the album as taking a split form of having a \"more agressive, more punky start\" then \"transposing into a more emotional and sadder, softer body of work\", which developed organically from the direction taken from the track Apparent Cause. The album was recorded with English Teacher producer Theo Verney in Brighton over the course of one month.\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nThe debut single, Skin, was released with the announcement of the album on 17 July 2023. A Living Commodity was released on 27 October 2023, being published by Yala Records, the label of The Maccabees frontman Felix White. Egyptian Blue toured the United Kingdom over November in promotion of the album, including a headline show at 100 Club in London. A music video was released in October for Salt, starring actor and comedian Tim Key.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nCharlotte Grimwade of Clash considered the album to be a \"refreshing blend and reinvention of classic \npunk and indie rock\", assessing the release as a more assured and mature release from the band. Describing the album as a \"restless and rewarding experience\", Jack Terry of DIY commended the album for its \"infectious\" and \"irresistible hooks\", although found the album to be frontloaded and have a more \"languishing\" pace in its second half. Comparing the album to the \"guitar-driven vigour and angular riffs\" of Gang of Four, Irina Shtreis of NME found the \"directness\" of the album to compromise its subtlety.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nAndy Buss, Isaac Ide, Leith Ambrose, Luke Phelps - performer\nJack Devonshire - saxophone\nTheo Verney - recording, mixing\nChristoph Skirl - engineer\n\n\n== References ==\n\nCategory:2023 debut albums\nCategory:Post-punk albums by British artists",

        "content": "Deir Aziz (Arabic: دير عزيز; 'Monastery of Aziz') is an ancient Jewish settlement on which a now-abandoned Syrian village was founded in the southern Golan Heights.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Syrian village was built on the ruins of a Jewish settlement that lived there during the Mishna and Talmudic periods, and included a synagogue, an oil press, a cemetery and probably also a pottery maker's house.\nRemains of two public buildings were found in the settlement. The one at the top of the hill is very large but has not been excavated to this day, and its use is still unclear. The second one, on the slopes to the south, was excavated in archaeological excavations and served as a synagogue.\nThe Khirbat Deir ʻAzziz Ancient synagogue is a rectangular hall measuring 11 meters by 18 meters, with a pile of ashlar stones, which according to information originated in the synagogue that was destroyed in the 749 CE earthquake. Under the floor of the hall, hundreds of coins were found, the latest of which are from the time of Justinian I, emperor of the Byzantine Empire (second quarter of the 6th century CE), and in the southern wall there is a prominent alcove for the Torah Ark.\nOn one of the windows of the ancient synagogue is the inscription in the Greek language: AZIZO, indicating that there is a possibility that the name \"Aziz\" is related to the original name of the Talmudic settlement there.\nThe village and the ancient settlement are located about two kilometers southeast of Moshav Kanaf, and near the ruins is a Kanaf spring, which was used by the settlement throughout history.\nThe village was under the control of Syria, as part of the Quneitra Governorate of the Pik branch, until the Six Day War, in which it was occupied by Israel and abandoned by its residents. Under Israeli rule, its territory was included in the Golan subdistrict of the Northern District.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n Media related to Deir Aziz at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Dewas Tekri (also known as Maa Chamunda Tekri, Dewas Mata Tekri, and Devi Vaishini Hill) is a sacred mountain located in the city of Dewas, Madhya Pradesh, India. Tekri is known for its religious significance as it houses two important shrines: the Devi Chamunda Mata Temple and the Devi Tulja Bhavani Mata Temple. There are several other temples, including the Kalika Mata Temple, Hanuman Temple, Bhairav Baba Temple, Kho Kho Mata Temple, and Annapurna Mata Temple. The word 'Tekri' means 'hill' in the local language. The main festival celebrated at Tekri is Navaratri, during which people from all over the country come to seek the blessings of Mata.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nDewas Tekri is situated in the middle of the city. It's just a 5-minute walk from Dewas Bus Stand and Dewas Railway Station. The nearest airport Devi Ahilya Bai Holkar Airport is 53 kilometers away. The temples on the hilltop can be accessed via stairs, a sliding path, or a ropeway. The height of Tekri is above 300 feet.\n\n\n== Origin ==\nLegend has it that Dewas Tekri is a Rakt Peeth (Shakti Peetha), where a few drops of Mata Sati's blood fell. At this place, amidst the hills, goddess Raktvahini Chamunda Mata and self-manifested Tulja Bhavani appeared.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThere is a disagreement about the age of Tekri. Some sources claim it dates back to the 9th century, while others suggest it to be 1100–1200 years old. Additionally, some believe that it originates from ancient times, known as \"anaadi kaal.\"\nE. M. Forster in his book The Hill of Devi, has also mentioned that Devi (or Devivasini, the Goddess’ Residence) probably gave Dewas its name. It rose about three hundred feet above the level. Stone steps led up to the dark cave of Chamunda on the top. She was a barbaric vermilion object, not often approached by us. Sometimes there were pilgrimages, and at certain festivals she played a part in the ritual. Who was Chamunda, and how long had she resided up there ? I never found out, but it was agreed that she had been around longer than anyone else.\n\n\n=== Story of Two Sister ===\nAccording to beliefs, both forms of the Mother Goddess are present in an awakened state on this hill. Tulja Bhavani and Maa Chamunda are believed to be sisters, with Tulja Bhavani being the elder sister and Chamunda Devi the younger. They used to reside together on this hill but had a disagreement, causing them to turn away from each other. Angered, they began to leave their place. Tulja Bhavani started disappearing into the Paatal Lok (underworld), while Chamunda Devi started descending the hill.\nLord Hanuman and Bhairav Baba intervened, requesting the goddesses to calm down and stay. However, by this time, part of Tulja Bhavani's body had already sunk into the underworld. She remained in the same position on the hill, while Chamunda Devi, who was descending, stopped at her current position. This is why Tulja Bhavani faces south and Chamunda faces north. Pilgrims visiting the Tekri perform Parikrama, starting with Tulja Bhavani and concluding with a darshan of Goddess Chamunda.\nThis is also the reason why Goddess Tulja Bhavani is referred to as Badi Mata (the elder mother) and Goddess Chamunda as Chhoti Mata (the younger mother).\n\n\n=== Cave to Ujjain ===\nIt is said that there has been a tunnel built connecting Mata Tekri of Dewas to Ujjain. This tunnel is 45 kilometers long and was used as a secret passage by King Bharthari. It leads from Dewas to Bharthari Cave in Ujjain, through which the king would travel to seek blessings from Mata.\n\n\n== Festivals ==\nThe main festivals celebrated here are Navaratri. During both Chaitra/Vasantik and Ashvin/Shardiya Navaratri, lakhs of pilgrims visit Tekri to seek the blessings of Mata. People visit Dewas Tekri from far away to make wishes. Some people pray that if their wishes are granted, they visit Tekri by climbing to the Mata temple on their knees or by performing full bowing (dandwat pranam) all the way up to the temple.\n\n\n== See also ==\nShree Siddhi Vinayak Ganesh Temple, Nagda\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Kerbelayi Abdulla Mosque is a mosque and historical architectural monument dating back to the 19th century, located at 155 Dilara Aliyeva Street in Baku, the capital city of Azerbaijan. The mosque was built in 1894 by philanthropist Abdulla Zerbaliyev.\nThe mosque was included in the list of local significant immovable historical and cultural monuments by the decision No. 132 of the Cabinet of Azerbaijan on August 2, 2001.\n\n\n== About ==\nAccording to the stone inscription on the Kerbelayi Abdulla mosque, the mosque was built in the Islamic calendar year 1336 (1918). However, the inscription on the entrance gate indicates the construction date as the Islamic calendar year 1311 (1894). The mosque was constructed by philanthropist Abdulla Zerbaliyev, a member of the Baku City Duma.After the Soviet occupation in Azerbaijan, the official campaign against religion began in 1928. In December of the same year, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan transferred many mosques, churches, and synagogues to the balance of clubs for educational purposes. If there were 3,000 mosques in Azerbaijan in 1917, by 1927, this number decreased to 1,700, and by 1933, it was only 17. Kerbelayi Abdulla mosque was also affected during this period, with one of its minarets being used for hanging nearby wet laundry. Another minaret was dismantled. Although the mosque was initially used as a residential building, it later served as a cardboard factory, warehouse, and painting studio for the Russian Drama Theater.After Azerbaijan regained its independence, the mosque's activities were restored in 1992 through the initiative of the local population. With the decision numbered 132 issued by the Cabinet of Azerbaijan on August 2, 2001, the mosque was included in the list of locally significant immovable historical and cultural monuments.The \"Kerbelayi Abdulla Mosque\" registered with the State Committee for Work with Religious Organizations of Azerbaijan, operates as a religious institution.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe mosque, built of salt stones, lacks both a dome and a minaret. The entrance to the prayer hall and the women's prayer area is separate and covered with curtains. The area of the prayer hall is 170 square meters.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Maida Jessie Clark  (5 November 1902 – 31 May 1991) was a New Zealand educator, politician, and community leader. She served as principal of Wellington Girls' College between 1950 and 1958, and was a Wellington city councillor from 1959 to 1968.\n\n\n== Early life and family ==\nClark was born in Wellington on 5 November 1902, the daughter of Jessie and Donald George Clark. She was educated at Wellington Girls' College, and went on to study history at Victoria University College, graduating with a Master of Arts degree with second-class honours in 1925.\n\n\n== Teaching career ==\nClark became a schoolteacher, and worked at New Plymouth Girls' High School, Auckland Girls' Grammar School, and Napier Girls' High School, as well as gaining experience teaching in England. She became headmistress of Wellington Girls' College, serving in that role from 1950 to 1958. \n\n\n== Political and other activities ==\nAt the 1959 local-body elections, Clark was elected under the banner of the Wellington Citizens' Association as a member of the Wellington City Council, polling fifth out of 46 candidates. She was re-elected at the next two elections, serving as a city councillor until 1968. She was a member of the city council's housing allocation committee, and represented the council on the state housing allocation committee.\nIn August 1960, Clark was selected as the National Party's candidate for the Onslow electorate at that year's general election. Standing against the Labour incumbent, Henry May, Clark gained 7880 votes, losing to May by 790 votes.\nClark was appointed to the Cinematograph Films Censorship Board of Appeal by Leon Götz, Minister of Internal Affairs, in 1962, serving until 1974. During her tenure, significant rulings in which Clark was involved include overturning the chief censor's ban on The Knack ...and How to Get It in 1966, and upholding the censor's decisions not to allow My Lover, My Son (1970), What Do You Say to a Naked Lady? (1972), and Last Tango in Paris (1973) to be screened in New Zealand. In the case of Last Tango in Paris, the review body's decision was not unanimous, but Clark agreed with the majority decision to ban the film.\nFrom 1962 to 1963, Clark served as president of the New Zealand Library Association. Between 1962 and 1974, she was a member of the Golden Kiwi distribution committee for youth and recreation matters. She was also active in sports administration, serving as patron of the Wellington Women's Cricket Association in 1961, vice president of the New Zealand Women's Hockey Association, and patron of the Wellington Women's Hockey Association. From 1950 to 1960, Clark was president of the Wellington YWCA board of directors, and she was president of Ohariu Golf Club in 1963.\n\n\n== Later life and death ==\nIn the 1975 Queen's Birthday Honours, Clark was appointed a Companion of the Queen's Service Order, for services to education and the community. She died in Lower Hutt on 31 May 1991, at the age of 88.\n\n\n== References ==",

He later moved to Pisa where he pursued an academic career, becoming a student of Ermanno Pinzani in specialized studies in obstetrics from 1895 to 1905. He then became a professor at the Universities of Perugia, Cagliari, Messina, and Parma. In 1918, he returned as a full professor to Bologna where he founded the journal Monitore Ostetrico, concurrently becoming the director of the Obstetrics Clinic until 1936. From 1923 to 1927, he served as the Rector of the University of Bologna. He was also a member of the Italian Society for the Progress of Sciences and from 1947 to 1949, of the Academy of Sciences of Bologna. In 1940, together with his wife, he donated all his writings and much of his real estate to the University of Bologna, which used them to establish the Pasquale Sfameni Foundation. The foundation awards an international quinquennial prize and several annual scholarships. He returned to his hometown of Torregrotta in 1948, where he died in 1955.\nA Freemason, he was a member of the Bologna lodge \"VIII Agosto\" of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite belonging to the Grand Orient of Italy, from which he resigned in 1925.\n\n\n== Major contributions ==\nPasquale Sfameni is internationally known for his research on pregnancy and childbirth, which led him, in 1922, to the publication of the theory on the Utero-Ovarian Revolution and the active dilation of the uterus. His studies focused on the female egg cell and the origin and development of the placenta, demonstrating the endocrine nature of the decidua basalis. His studies on vesicovaginal fistulae, which he successfully treated for the first time through surgical intervention, are also noteworthy. The body of his major works is known in medical literature as the Humoral Hormonal Doctrine of Sfameni.\n\n\n== Works ==\nCommemorazione del Prof. Giovanni Calderini (1922)\n\n\n== Honours ==\nCommander of the Order of the Crown of Italy – December 20, 1924\nOfficer of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus\nOrder of San Marino\nCommander of the Civil Order of Alfonso X, the Wise\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nLuigi Bacialli. \"Brief biography of Pasquale Sfameni\" (PDF). archiviostorico.unibo.it.

It features eight domes and was built using a mixture of egg yolk and ordinary wood ash. The bathhouse's water is heated using only one furnace.\nAfter the Soviet occupation, the bathhouse was handed over to the Kolkhoz. It underwent renovation for the last time in 1980 and remained in use by the local population until the end of that year.\nFollowing the restoration of Azerbaijan's independence, the bathhouse was included in the list of local significant immovable historical and cultural monuments by decision No. 132 of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Azerbaijan on August 2, 2001.\nDue to years of disuse, several of its domes have collapsed, and the building has fallen into a state of disrepair. It is in urgent need of substantial restoration.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n216-year-old bathhouse in Astara district / APA TV\nThe historic bathhouse has fallen into disrepair/ ATV News\nThe Historic Sheypurlu Bath of Erchivan",

The hospital no longer exists and was converted into a block of High Court to house fire engines. The hospital has been shifted to a new location and today this building is called H-block of the High Court. The building was previously categorised as a Heritage Building as per HUDA regulations and in 2010 was delisted from the list of Heritage building so as to be demolished and to be converted into a multi level car park for the employees of High Court and visitors. The government order to demolish was issued in April 2019 and the High Court had proposed that work be taken up in May during the summer vacations. The hospital premises also contains a fountain know as Dog Fountain from Qutub Shahi era which is also set to be demolished. On 16 May 2019, based on an appeal by heritage activists the order to demolish the Zenana building was stayed by High Court.\n\n\n== History ==\nThis was the first hospital built in Hyderabad to exclusively treat women. The foundation of the hospital was laid by Princess of Wales in 1905. The building was built during the reign of the sixth Nizam of Hyderabad. The hospital was earlier known as Zenana Hospital and later renamed as Victoria Maternity Hospital. The world's first qualified women anesthetist Dr Rupa Bai Fardonji had worked in this hospital during the 1900s.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Abbey of La Chaise-Dieu, in Auvergne (La Chasa-Dieu in Occitan), is a former Benedictine abbey, headquarters of the Casadean order, located in the commune of La Chaise-Dieu in the department of Haute-Loire.\nThe origin of the name is the Latin phrase Casa Dei (The House of God), hence the adjective \"Casadean.\" The Benedictine abbey is renowned for its Gothic architecture, its rich library, its workshop for liturgical books, its Danse Macabre, its curious Hall of Echoes, its choir tapestry composed of twelve Flemish tapestries, and its music festival founded in 1966 by György Cziffra.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Benedictine abbey, which gave its name (derived by analogical assonance from medieval Latin Casadei) to a portion of the Auvergne plateau, was founded in 1043 by Robert de Turlande, a hermit, Étienne de Chaliers, and a certain Delmas along with his disciples who arrived promptly. Robert de Turlande obtained both the protection of the Holy See and a diploma from the King of the Franks, Henry I, dated September 20, 1052, confirming its elevation to an abbey.\nOn August 18, 1095, Pope Urban II visited the abbey and proceeded with the dedication of the abbey church in honor of Saint Vital of Bologna and his master Saint Agricola, as confirmed by a papal bull dated September 7 at Saint-Gilles.\nA real growth began in the 14th century. In May 1342, Pierre Rogier, one of the monks of La Chaise-Dieu, became pope in Avignon under the name Clement VI. It was he who financed the demolition of the old Romanesque church and the construction of the new abbey church in which he would be buried. He enlisted the three greatest architects of the time: Hugues Morel, Pierre de Cébazat, and Pierre Falciat. The abbey church was completed in 1378, during the pontificate of Pope Gregory XI, who was Clement VI's own nephew.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe abbey church of Saint-Robert was built from 1344 to 1352 in the Gothic style, at the behest of Pope Clement VI to house his tomb.\nThe abbey church replaces the old Romanesque building at the foot of which Saint Robert de Turlande, founder of the abbey, had been buried.\nLarger and more spacious, the new abbey church belongs to the period of Rayonnant Gothic, embodying a version marked by great austerity. It is often considered a work of Southern Gothic, although its significance extends well beyond this regional context. The building has been classified as a historical monument since 1840.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Benedictine monasteries in France\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

Prior to this venture, Soenke and Becker had successfully co-founded the calendar app Meeter, which was eventually acquired through an equity hire in 2020.\nIn its early stages, Throne successfully raised an initial and sole fundraising round in 2022, attracting investments from angel investors, including Product Hunt founder Ryan Hoover, and entrepreneurs Cory Levy and Vibhu Norby. Following this fundraising achievement and reaching profitability early on, the company decided to forego further rounds of venture capital funding.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Dhanapāla was an author and convert to Jainism, born at Ujjain in 973 (saṃvat 1029). His death date is not recorded but was likely in the 1050s. Born a Hindu and brāhmaṇa in the Kāśyapa gotra, he was first opposed to Jainism, but was eventually won over by his brother Śobhana in about 977. Śobhaṇa was a pupil of the Jain preceptor Mahendra (Candragaccha).\nFor the greater part of his life, Dhānapāla lived in Dhar (ancient Dhārā) where he had much influence on the court of the Paramāra rulers. According to Merutunga, Dhānapāla was the leading paṇḍit in the kingdom.\nDhanapāla is best know for his literary works on account of which he bore the epithet siddhasārasvatakavi (the 'poet whose accomplishment is derived from Sarasvatī'). Among his famous works are Ṛṣabhapañcāśikā, a poetic hymn to the first Jina Adinātha, and the Prakrit lexicon Pāiyalacchīnāmamālā, in the closing verses of which the author states that the work was completed in saṃvat 1029 (972–73).\nThe Tilakamañjarī, a prose romance, is exceptionally well known and studied. On account of this work, composed just after his conversion to Jainsim, Dhanapāla was given the title ‘Sarasvatī’ by Vākpati Muñja (c. 973–995). The name involves a play on words given Sarasvatī is also known as Vāgdevī, 'the Goddess of Speech' and Muñja's epithet Vākpati means 'Lord of Speech', i.e. Brahmā, the male consort of Sarasvatī.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Millennials, also known as Generation Y, are the demographic cohort following Generation X and preceding Generation Z. The generation is typically defined as people born between 1981 and 1996.\nIn 2018, as the number of robots at work continued to increase, the global unemployment rate fell to 5%, the lowest in 38 years. Trends suggest that developments in artificial intelligence and robotics will not result in mass unemployment but can actually create high-skilled jobs. However, in order to take advantage of this situation, one needs to hone skills that machines have not yet mastered, such as teamwork and effective communication.\nBy analyzing data from the United Nations and the Global Talent Competitive Index, KDM Engineering found that as of 2019, the top five countries for international high-skilled workers are Switzerland, Singapore, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Sweden. Factors taken into account included the ability to attract high-skilled foreign workers, business-friendliness, regulatory environment, the quality of education, and the standard of living. Switzerland is best at retaining talents due to its excellent quality of life. Singapore is home to a world-class environment for entrepreneurs. And the United States offers the most opportunity for growth due to the sheer size of its economy and the quality of higher education and training. As of 2019, these are also some of the world's most competitive economies, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF). In order to determine a country or territory's economic competitiveness, the WEF considers factors such as the trustworthiness of public institutions, the quality of infrastructure, macro-economic stability, the quality of healthcare, business dynamism, labor market efficiency, and innovation capacity.\nDuring the first two decades of the twenty-first century, right before the COVID-19 pandemic, economic activities tended to concentrate in the large metropolitan areas, such as San Francisco, New York, London, Tokyo and Sydney. Productivity increased enormously as knowledge workers agglomerated. The COVID-19 pandemic led to an increase in remote work, more so in developed countries, aided by technology.\nUsing a variety of measures, economists have reached the conclusion that the rate of innovation and entrepreneurship has been declining across the Western world between the early 1990s and early 2010s, when it leveled off. In the case of the U.S., one of the most complex economies in existence, economist Nicholas Kozeniauskas explained that \"the decline in entrepreneurship is concentrated among the smart\" as the share of entrepreneurs with university degrees in that country more than halved between the mid-1980s and the mid-2010s. There are many possible reasons for this: population aging, market concentration, and zombie firms (those with low productivity but are kept alive by subsidies). While employment has become more stable and more suitable, modern economies are so complex they are essentially ossified, making them vulnerable to disruptions.\n\n\n== In Asia ==\nStatistics from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reveal that between 2014 and 2019, Japan's unemployment rate went from about 4% to 2.4% and China's from almost 4.5% to 3.8%. These are some of the lowest rates among the largest economies of the world. However, due to long-running sub-replacement fertility, Japan had just over two workers per retiree in the 2010s, compared to four in North America. As a result, the country faces economic stagnation and serious financial burden to support the elderly. China's economy was growing at a feverish pace between the late 1970s till the early 2010s, when demographic constraints made themselves felt. Key to China's \"economic miracle\" was its one-child policy, which curbed population growth and enabled the economy to industrialize rapidly. Yet the policy has also led to population aging. Political economist and demographer Nicholas Eberstadt argued that China's working population peaked in 2014. Even so, economist Brad Setser suggested that China can still increase its GDP per capita by raising the age of retirement and making it easier for people to migrate from rural to urban areas. But social scientist Wang Feng warned that as the population ages, social welfare spending as a share of GDP will also grow, intensifying sociopolitical problems. During the mid-2010s, China had five workers for every retiree. But if current trends continue, by the 2040s, that ratio will fall to just 1.6.\nAt the start of the twenty-first century, export-oriented South Korea and Taiwan were young and dynamic compared to Japan, but they, too, were aging quickly. Their millennial cohorts are too small compared to the baby boomers. The fact that large numbers of South Koreans and Taiwanese were entering retirement will restrict the ability of their countries to save and invest.\nAccording to IMF, \"Vietnam is at risk of growing old before it grows rich.\" The share of working-age Vietnamese peaked in 2011, when the country's annual GDP per capita at purchasing power parity was $5,024, compared to $32,585 for South Korea, $31,718 for Japan, and $9,526 for China. Many Vietnamese youths suffer from unstable job markets, low wages, and high costs of living in the cities. As a result, large numbers live with their parents till the age of 30. These are some of the reasons contributing to Vietnam's falling fertility rate and population aging.\n\n\n== In Europe ==\n\nEconomic prospects for some millennials have declined largely due to the Great Recession in the late 2000s. Several governments have instituted major youth employment schemes out of fear of social unrest due to the dramatically increased rates of youth unemployment. In Europe, youth unemployment levels were very high (56% in Spain, 44% in Italy, 35% in the Baltic states, 19% in Britain and more than 20% in many more countries). In 2009, leading commentators began to worry about the long-term social and economic effects of the unemployment.\nA variety of names have emerged in various European countries hard hit following the financial crisis of 2007–2008 to designate young people with limited employment and career prospects. These groups can be considered to be more or less synonymous with millennials, or at least major sub-groups in those countries. The Generation of €700 is a term popularized by the Greek mass media and refers to educated Greek twixters of urban centers who generally fail to establish a career. In Greece, young adults are being \"excluded from the labor market\" and some \"leave their country of origin to look for better options\". They are being \"marginalized and face uncertain working conditions\" in jobs that are unrelated to their educational background, and receive the minimum allowable base salary of €700 per month. This generation evolved in circumstances leading to the Greek debt crisis and some participated in the 2010–2011 Greek protests. In Spain, they are referred to as the mileurista (for €1,000 per month), in France \"The Precarious Generation,\" and as in Spain, Italy also has the \"milleurista\"; generation of €1,000 (per month).\nBetween 2009 and 2018, about half a million Greek youths left their country in search of opportunities elsewhere, and this phenomenon has exacerbated the nation's demographic problem. Such brain drains are rare among countries with good education systems. Greek millennials benefit from tuition-free universities but suffer from their government's mishandling of taxes and excessive borrowing. Greek youths typically look for a career in finance in the United Kingdom, medicine in Germany, engineering in the Middle East, and information technology in the United States. Many also seek advanced degrees abroad in order to ease the visa application process.\nIn 2016, research from the Resolution Foundation found millennials in the United Kingdom earned £8,000 less in their 20s than Generation X, describing millennials as \"on course to become the first generation to earn less than the one before\". According to a report from the same organization in 2017, the rate of home ownership of British baby boomers was 75% and \"the real value of estates passing on death has more than doubled over the past 20 years.\" For this reason, the transfer of wealth between the baby boomers and their children, the millennials, will prove highly beneficial to the latter compared to previous cohorts, especially those who came from high-income families.\n\nSpanish think-tank Fedea noted that there were way too few young Europeans enrolled in vocational programs that teach them skills favored by the job market. Many new entrants to the workforce lacked the necessary skills demanded by employers.\nSince joining the European Union during the 2007 enlargement of the European Union, Bulgaria has seen a significant portion of its population, many of whom young and educated, leave for better opportunities elsewhere, notably Germany. While the government has failed to keep reliable statistics, economists have estimated that at least 60,000 Bulgarians leave their homeland each year. 30,000 moved to Germany in 2017. As of 2019, an estimated 1.1 million Bulgarians lived abroad. Bulgaria had a population of about seven million in 2018, and this number is projected to continue to decline not just due to low birth rates but also to emigration.\nDue to the strong correlation between economic growth and youth employment, recessions come with dire consequences for young people in the workforce. In the struggling Southern European economies, such as Greece and Spain, youth unemployment lingered on in the aftermath of the Great Recession, remaining stuck at around a third. With another recession induced by the COVID-19 global pandemic, it could rise to about half. Even the Czech Republic, which previously boasted the lowest youth unemployment rate in Europe, at about 5%, could see that number triple in 2020. Overall, European job markets are hostile towards new entrants, who, unlike their older counterparts, do not have permanent contracts and are often the first to be laid off during hard times.\n\n\n== In Canada ==\nIn Canada, the youth unemployment rate in July 2009 was 16%, the highest in 11 years. Between 2014 and 2019, Canada's overall unemployment rate fell from about 7% to below 6%. However, a 2018 survey by accounting and advisory firm BDO Canada found that 34% of millennials felt \"overwhelmed\" by their non-mortgage debt. For comparison, this number was 26% for Generation X and 13% for the Baby Boomers. Canada's average non-mortgage debt was CAN$20,000 in 2018. About one in five millennials were delaying having children because of financial worries. Many Canadian millennial couples are also struggling with their student loan debts.\n\nDespite expensive housing costs, Canada's largest cities, Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal, continue to attract millennials thanks to their economic opportunities and cultural amenities. Research by the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) revealed that for every person in the 20-34 age group who leaves the nation's top cities, Toronto gains seven while Vancouver and Montreal gain up to a dozen each. In fact, there has been a surge in the millennial populations of Canada's top three cities between 2015 and 2018. However, millennials' rate of home ownership will likely drop as increasing numbers choose to rent instead. By 2019, however, Ottawa emerged as a magnet for millennials with its strong labor market and comparatively low cost of living, according to a study by Ryerson University. Many of the millennials relocating to the nation's capital were above the age of 25, meaning they were more likely to be job seekers and home buyers rather than students.\nAn average Canadian home was worth C$484,500 in 2018. Despite government legislation (mortgage stress test rules), such a price was quite high compared to some decades before. Adjusted for inflation, it was C$210,000 in 1976. Paul Kershaw of the University of British Columbia calculated that the average amount of extra money needed for a down payment in the late 2010s compared to one generation before was equivalent to eating 17 avocado toasts each day for ten years. Meanwhile, the option of renting in a large city is increasingly out of reach for many young Canadians. In 2019, the average rent in Canada cost C$1,040 a month, according to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC). But, as is always the case in real-estate, location matters. An average two-bedroom apartment cost C$1,748 per month in Vancouver and C$1,547 per month in Toronto, with vacancy rates at about 1.1% and 1.5%, respectively. Canada's national vacancy rate was 2.4% in 2018, the lowest since 2009. New supply—rental apartment complexes that are newly completed or under construction—has not been able to keep up with rising demand. Besides higher prices, higher interest rates and stricter mortgage rules have made home ownership more difficult. International migration contributes to rising demand for housing, especially rental apartments, according to the CMHC, as new arrivals tend to rent rather than purchase. Moreover, a slight decline in youth unemployment in 2018 also drove up demand. While the Canadian housing market is growing, this growth is detrimental to the financial well-being of young Canadians.\nIn 2019, Canada's net public debt was C$768 billion. Meanwhile, U.S. public debt amounted to US$22 trillion. The Canadian federal government's official figure for the debt-to-GDP ratio was 31%. However, this figure left out debts from lower levels of government. Once these were taken into account, the figure jumped to 88%, according to the International Monetary Fund. For comparison, that number was 238% for Japan, 107% for the United States, and 99% for France. Canada's public debt per person was over CAN$18,000. For Americans, it was US$69,000. Since the Great Recession, Canadian households have accumulated significantly more debt. According to Statistics Canada, the national debt-to-disposable income ratio was 175% in 2019. It was 105% in the U.S. Meanwhile, the national median mortgage debt rose from C$95,400 in 1999 to C$190,000 in 2016 (in 2016 dollars). Numbers are much higher in the Greater Toronto Area, Vancouver, and Victoria, B.C.\nA 2018 survey by Abacus Data of 4,000 Canadian millennials found that 80% identified as members of the middle class, 55% had pharmaceutical insurance, 53% dental insurance, 36% a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP), and 29% an employer-sponsored pension plan. A number of millennials have opted to save their money and retire early while traveling rather than settling in an expensive North American city. According to them, such a lifestyle costs less than living in a large city.\nBetween the late-2000s and mid-2010s, Canada's tourism deficit—the difference in the amount Canadian travelers spent inside versus outside the nation—grew considerably, exceeding CAN$10 billion in 2008. According to Destination Canada, a Crown agency responsible for promoting tourism in Canada, younger Canadians were eight times more likely to travel outside Canada than inside the nation. This is due to a number of factors. The cost of transportation within Canada was often higher than that of traveling to other countries. For example, flight tickets to Europe were often cheaper than to Toronto or Montreal. Many Canadian millennials view foreign destinations as exotic and more desirable than in Canada. Social media influenced this tendency, as posts showcasing non-Canadian sites were better received than those about Canadian destinations.\n\n\n== In the United States ==\n\n\n=== Employment and finances ===\n\nQuantitative historian Peter Turchin observed that demand for labor in the United States had been stagnant since 2000 and would likely continue to 2020 as the nation approached the trough of the Kondratiev wave. (See graphic.) Moreover, the share of people in their 20s continued to grow till the end of the 2010s according projections by the U.S. Census Bureau, meaning the youth bulge would likely not fade away before the 2020s. As such the gap between the supply and demand in the labor market would likely not fall before then, and falling or stagnant wages generate sociopolitical stress. For example, between the mid-1970s and 2011, the number of law-school graduates tripled, from around 400,000 to 1.2 million while the population grew by only 45%. During the 2010s, U.S. law schools produced 25,000 surplus graduates each year, and many of them were in debt. The number of people with a Master's of Business Administration (MBA) degree grew even faster. Having more highly educated people than the market can absorb—elite overproduction—can destabilize society.\nThe youth unemployment rate in the U.S. reached a record 19% in July 2010 since the statistic started being gathered in 1948. Underemployment is also a major factor. In the U.S. the economic difficulties have led to dramatic increases in youth poverty, unemployment, and the numbers of young people living with their parents. In April 2012, it was reported that half of all new college graduates in the US were still either unemployed or underemployed.\nIn fact, millennials have benefited the least from the economic recovery following the Great Recession, as average incomes for this generation have fallen at twice the general adult population's total drop and are likely to be on a path toward lower incomes for at least another decade. According to a Bloomberg L.P., \"Three and a half years after the worst recession since the Great Depression, the earnings and employment gap between those in the under-35 population and their parents and grandparents threatens to unravel the American dream of each generation doing better than the last. The nation's younger workers have benefited least from an economic recovery that has been the most uneven in recent history.\" Despite higher college attendance rates than Generation X, many were stuck in low-paid jobs, with the percentage of degree-educated young adults working in low-wage industries rising from 23% to 33% between 2000 and 2014. Not only did they receive lower wages, they also had to work longer hours for fewer benefits. By the mid-2010s, it had already become clear that the U.S. economy was evolving into a highly dynamic and increasingly service-oriented system, with careers getting replaced by short-term full-time jobs, full-time jobs by part-time positions, and part-time positions by income-generating hobbies. In one important way the economic prospects of millennials are similar to those of their parents the baby boomers: their huge number means that the competition for jobs was always going to be intense.\nA 2013 joint study by sociologists at the University of Virginia and Harvard University found that the decline and disappearance of stable full-time jobs with health insurance and pensions for people who lack a college degree has had profound effects on working-class Americans, who now are less likely to marry and have children within marriage than those with college degrees. Data from a 2014 study of U.S. millennials revealed over 56% of this cohort considers themselves as part of the working class, with only approximately 35% considering themselves as part of the middle class; this class identity is the lowest polling of any generation. A 2020 paper by economists William G. Gale, Hilary Gelfond, Jason J. Fichtner, and Benjamin H. Harris examines the wealth accumulated by different demographic cohorts using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances. They find that while the Great Recession has diminished the wealth of all age groups in the short run, a longitudinal analysis reveals that older generations have been able to acquire more wealth whereas millennials have gotten poorer overall. In particular, the wealth of millennials in 2016 was less than that of older generations when they were their age in 1989 and 2007. Millennials enjoy a number of important advantages compared to their elders, such as higher levels of education, and longer working lives, but they suffer some disadvantages including limited prospects of economic growth, leading to delayed home ownership and marriage.\nMillennials are the most highly educated and culturally diverse group of all generations, and have been regarded as hard to please when it comes to employers. To address these new challenges, many large firms are currently studying the social and behavioral patterns of millennials and are trying to devise programs that decrease intergenerational estrangement, and increase relationships of reciprocal understanding between older employees and millennials. The UK's Institute of Leadership & Management researched the gap in understanding between millennial recruits and their managers in collaboration with Ashridge Business School. The findings included high expectations for advancement, salary and for a coaching relationship with their manager, and suggested that organizations will need to adapt to accommodate and make the best use of millennials. In an example of a company trying to do just this, Goldman Sachs conducted training programs that used actors to portray millennials who assertively sought more feedback, responsibility, and involvement in decision making. After the performance, employees discussed and debated the generational differences which they saw played out. In 2014, millennials were entering an increasingly multi-generational workplace. Even though research has shown that millennials are joining the workforce during a tough economic time, they still have remained optimistic, as shown when about nine out of ten millennials surveyed by the Pew Research Center said that they currently have enough money or that they will eventually reach their long-term financial goals.\n\nAccording to a 2019 TD Ameritrade survey of 1,015 U.S. adults aged 23 and older with at least US$10,000 in investable assets, two thirds of people aged 23 to 38 (millennials) felt they were not saving enough for retirement, and the top reason why was expensive housing (37%). This was especially true for millennials with families. 21% said student debt prevented them from saving for the future. For comparison, this number was 12% for Generation X and 5% for the Baby Boomers. While millennials are well known for taking out large amounts of student loans, these are actually not their main source of non-mortgage personal debt, but rather credit card debt. According to a 2019 Harris poll, the average non-mortgage personal debt of millennials was US$27,900, with credit card debt representing the top source at 25%. For comparison, mortgages were the top source of debt for the Baby Boomers and Generation X (28% and 30%, respectively) and student loans for Generation Z (20%).\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Labor, the unemployment rate in September 2019 was 3.5%, a number not seen since December 1969. For comparison, unemployment attained a maximum of 10% after the Great Recession in October 2009. At the same time, labor participation remained steady and most job growth tended to be full-time positions. Economists generally consider a population with an unemployment rate lower than 4% to be fully employed. In fact, even people with disabilities or prison records are getting hired. Between June 2018 and June 2019, the U.S. economy added a minimum of 56,000 jobs (February 2019) and a maximum of 312,000 jobs (January 2019). The average monthly job gain between the same period was about 213,600. Tony Bedikian, managing director and head of global markets at Citizens Bank, said this is the longest period of economic expansion on record. At the same time, wages continue to grow, especially for low-income earners. On average, they grew by 2.7% in 2016 and 3.3% in 2018. However, the Pew Research Center found that the average wage in the U.S. in 2018 remained more or less the same as it was in 1978, when the seasons and inflation are taken into consideration. Real wages grew only for the top 90th percentile of earners and to a lesser extent the 75th percentile (in 2018 dollars). Nevertheless, these developments ease fears of an upcoming recession. Moreover, economists believe that job growth could slow to an average of just 100,000 per month and still be sufficient to keep up with population growth and keep economic recovery going. As long as firms keep hiring and wages keep growing, consumer spending should prevent another recession. Millennials are expected to make up approximately half of the U.S. workforce by 2020.\nAs they saw their economic prospects improved in the aftermath of the Great Recession, the COVID-19 global pandemic hit, forcing lock-down measures that resulted in an enormous number of people losing their jobs. For millennials, this is the second major economic downturn in their adult lives so far. However, by early 2022, as the pandemic waned, workers aged 25 to 64 were returning to the work force at a steady pace. According to the Economist, if the trend continued, then their work-force participation would return to the pre-pandemic level of 83% by the end of 2022. Even so, the U.S. economy would continue to face labor shortages, which puts workers at an advantage while contributing to inflation.\n\nHuman capital is the engine of economic growth. With this in mind, urban researcher Richard Florida and his collaborators analyzed data from the U.S. Census from between 2012 and 2017 and found that the ten cities with the largest shares of adults with a bachelor's degree or higher are Seattle (63%), San Francisco, the District of Columbia, Raleigh, Austin, Minneapolis, Portland, Denver, Atlanta, and Boston (48%). More specifically, the ten cities with the largest shares of people with graduate degrees are the District of Columbia (33%), Seattle, San Francisco, Boston, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Portland, Denver, Austin, and San Diego (19%). These are the leading information technology hubs of the United States. Cities with the lowest shares of college graduates tend to be from the Rust Belt, such as Detroit, Memphis, and Milwaukee, and the Sun Belt, such as Las Vegas, Fresno, and El Paso. Meanwhile, the ten cities with the fastest growth in the shares of college-educated adults are Miami (46%), Austin, Fort Worth, Las Vegas, Denver, Charlotte, Boston, Mesa, Nashville, and Seattle (25%). More specifically, those with the fastest growing shares of adults with graduate degrees are Miami (47%), Austin, Raleigh, Charlotte, San Jose, Omaha, Seattle, Fresno, Indianapolis, and Sacramento (32%).\nFlorida and his team also found, using U.S. Census data between 2005 and 2017, an increase in employment across the board for members of the \"creative class\"—people in education, healthcare, law, the arts, technology, science, and business, not all of whom have a university degree—in virtually all U.S. metropolitan areas with a population of a million or more. Indeed, the total number of the creative class grew from 44 million in 2005 to over 56 million in 2017. Florida suggested that this could be a \"tipping point\" in which talents head to places with a high quality of life yet lower costs of living than well-established creative centers, such as New York City and Los Angeles, what he called the \"superstar cities\".\nAccording to the Department of Education, people with technical or vocational training are slightly more likely to be employed than those with a bachelor's degree and significantly more likely to be employed in their fields of specialty. The United States currently suffers from a shortage of skilled tradespeople. As of 2019, the most recent data from the U.S. government reveals that there are over half a million vacant manufacturing jobs in the country, a record high, thanks to an increasing number of Baby Boomers entering retirement. But in order to attract new workers to overcome this \"Silver Tsunami\", manufacturers need to debunk a number of misconceptions about their industries. For example, the American public tends to underestimate the salaries of manufacturing workers. Nevertheless, the number of people doubting the viability of American manufacturing has declined to 54% in 2019 from 70% in 2018, the L2L Manufacturing Index measured. After the Great Recession, the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs reached a minimum of 11.5 million in February 2010. It rose to 12.8 million in September 2019. It was 14 million in March 2007. As of 2019, manufacturing industries made up 12% of the U.S. economy, which is increasingly reliant on service industries, as is the case for other advanced economies around the world. Nevertheless, twenty-first-century manufacturing is increasingly sophisticated, using advanced robotics, 3D printing, cloud computing, among other modern technologies, and technologically savvy employees are precisely what employers need. Four-year university degrees are unnecessary; technical or vocational training, or perhaps apprenticeships would do.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the occupations with the highest median annual pay in the United States in 2018 included medical doctors (especially psychiatrists, anesthesiologists, obstetricians and gynecologists, surgeons, and orthodontists), chief executives, dentists, information system managers, chief architects and engineers, pilots and flight engineers, petroleum engineers, and marketing managers. Their median annual pay ranged from about US$134,000 (marketing managers) to over US$208,000 (aforementioned medical specialties). Meanwhile, the occupations with the fastest projected growth rate between 2018 and 2028 are solar cell and wind turbine technicians, healthcare and medical aides, cyber security experts, statisticians, speech–language pathologists, genetic counselors, mathematicians, operations research analysts, software engineers, forest fire inspectors and prevention specialists, post-secondary health instructors, and phlebotomists. Their projected growth rates are between 23% (medical assistants) and 63% (solar cell installers); their annual median pays range from roughly US$24,000 (personal care aides) to over US$108,000 (physician assistants). Occupations with the highest projected numbers of jobs added between 2018 and 2028 are healthcare and personal aides, nurses, restaurant workers (including cooks and waiters), software developers, janitors and cleaners, medical assistants, construction workers, freight laborers, marketing researchers and analysts, management analysts, landscapers and groundskeepers, financial managers, tractor and truck drivers, and medical secretaries. The total numbers of jobs added ranges from 881,000 (personal care aides) to 96,400 (medical secretaries). Annual median pays range from over US$24,000 (fast-food workers) to about US$128,000 (financial managers).\nDespite economic recovery and despite being more likely to have a bachelor's degree or higher, millennials are at a financial disadvantage compared to the Baby Boomers and Generation X because of the Great Recession and expensive higher education. Income has become less predictable due to the rise of short-term and freelance positions. According to a 2019 report from the non-partisan non-profit think tank New America, a household headed by a person under 35 in 2016 had an average net worth of almost US$11,000, compared to US$20,000 in 1995. According to the St. Louis Federal Reserve, an average millennial (20 to 35 in 2016) owned US$162,000 of assets, compared to US$198,000 for Generation X at the same age (20 to 35 in 2001). Risk management specialist and business economist Olivia S. Mitchell of the University of Pennsylvania calculated that in order to retire at 50% of their last salary before retirement, millennials will have to save 40% of their incomes for 30 years. She told CNBC, \"Benefits from Social Security are 76% higher if you claim at age 70 versus 62, which can substitute for a lot of extra savings.\" Maintaining a healthy lifestyle—avoiding smoking, over-drinking, and sleep deprivation—should prove beneficial.\n\n\n=== Housing ===\n\nDespite the availability of affordable housing, and broadband Internet, the possibility of telecommuting, the reality of high student loan debts and the stereotype of living in their parents' basement, millennials were steadily leaving rural counties for urban areas for lifestyle and economic reasons in the early 2010s. At that time, millennials were responsible for the so-called \"back-to-the-city\" trend. Between 2000 and 2010, the number of Americans living in urban areas grew from 79% to 81% while that in rural areas dropped from 21% to 19%. At the same time, many new cities were born, especially in the Midwest, and others, such as Charlotte, North Carolina, and Austin, Texas, were growing enormously. According to demographer William Frey of the Brookings Institution, the population of young adults (18–34 years of age) in U.S. urban cores increased 5% between 2010 and 2015, the bulk of which can be attributed to ethnic-minority millennials. In fact, this demographic trend was making American cities and their established suburbs more ethnically diverse. On the other hand, white millennials were the majority in emerging suburbs and exurbs. Mini-apartments, initially found mainly in Manhattan, became more and more common in other major urban areas as a strategy for dealing with high population density and high demand for housing, especially among people living alone. The size of a typical mini-apartment is 300 square feet (28 square meters), or roughly the size of a standard garage and one eighth the size of an average single-family home in the U.S. as of 2013. Many young city residents were willing to give up space in exchange for living in a location they liked. Such apartments are also common in Tokyo and some European capitals. Data from the Census Bureau reveals that in 2018, 34% of American adults below the age of 35 owned a home, compared to the national average of almost 64%.\nYet by the late 2010s, things changed. Like older generations, millennials reevaluate their life choices as they age. Millennials no longer felt attracted by cosmopolitan metropolitan areas the way they once did. A 2018 Gallup poll found that despite living in a highly urbanized country, most Americans would rather live in rural counties than the cities. While rural America lacked the occupational diversity offered by urban America, multiple rural counties can still match one major city in terms of economic opportunities. In addition, rural towns suffered from shortages of certain kinds of professionals, such as medical doctors, and young people moving in, or back, could make a difference for both themselves and their communities. The slower pace of life and lower costs of living were both important.\n\nBy analyzing U.S. Census data, demographer William H. Frey at the Brookings Institution found that, following the Great Recession, American suburbs grew faster than dense urban cores. For example, for every one person who moved to New York City, five moved out to one of its suburbs. Data released by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2017 revealed that Americans aged 25–29 were 25% more likely to move from a city to a suburb than the other way around; for older millennials, that number was 50%. Economic recovery and easily obtained mortgages help explain this phenomenon. Millennial homeowners are more likely to be in the suburbs than the cities. This trend will likely continue as more and more millennials purchase a home. 2019 was the fourth year in a row where the number of millennials living in the major American cities declined measurably. Exurbs are increasingly popular among millennials, too. According to Karen Harris, managing director at Bain Macro Trends, at the current rate of growth, exurbs will have more people than cities for the first time in 2025. In 2018, 80,000 millennials left the nation's largest cities. Among the Baby Boomers who have retired, a significant portion opts to live in the suburbs, where the Millennials are also moving to in large numbers as they have children of their own. These confluent trends increase the level of economic activities in the American suburbs.\nWhile 14% of the U.S. population relocate at least once each year, Americans in their 20s and 30s are more likely to move than retirees, according to Frey. People leaving the big cities generally look for places with low cost of living, including housing costs, warmer climates, lower taxes, better economic opportunities, and better school districts for their children. Economics of space is also important, now that it has become much easier to transmit information and that e-commerce and delivery services have contracted perceived distances. Places in the South and Southwestern United States are especially popular. In some communities, millennials and their children are moving in so quickly that schools and roads are becoming overcrowded. This rising demand pushes prices upwards, making affordable housing options less plentiful. Historically, between the 1950s and 1980s, Americans left the cities for the suburbs because of crime. Suburban growth slowed because of the Great Recession but picked up pace afterwards. According to the Brookings Institution, overall, American cities with the largest net losses in their millennial populations were New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago, while those with the top net gains were Houston, Denver, and Dallas. According to Census data, Los Angeles County in particular lost 98,608 people in 2018, the single biggest loss in the nation. Moving trucks (U-Haul) are in extremely high demand in the area.\nHigh taxes and high cost of living are also reasons why people are leaving entire states behind. As is the case with cities, young people are the most likely to relocate. For example, a 2019 poll by Edelman Intelligence of 1,900 residents of California found that 63% of millennials said they were thinking about leaving the Golden State and 55% said they wanted to do so within five years. 60% of millennials said the reason why they wanted to move as the cost and availability of housing. In 2018, the median home price in California was US$547,400, about twice the national median. California also has the highest marginal income tax rate of all U.S. states, 12%, plus a subcharge of 1% for those earning a million dollars a year or more. Popular destinations include Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, and Texas, according to California's Legislative Analyst's Office. By analyzing data provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), finance company SmartAsset found that for wealthy millennials, defined as those no older than 35 years of age earning at least US$100,000 per annum, the top states of departure were New York, Illinois, Virginia, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania, while the top states of destination were California, Washington State, Texas, Colorado, and Florida. SmartAsset also found that the cities with the largest percentages of millennial homeowners in 2018 were Anchorage, AK; Gilbert and Peoria, AZ; Palmdale, Moreno Valley, Hayward, and Garden Grove, CA; Cape Floral, FL; Sioux Falls, SD; and Midland, TX. Among these cities, millennial home-owning rates were between 57% (Gilbert, AZ) and 34% (Hayward, CA). The median price of a home purchased by millennials in 2019 was $256,500, compared to $160,600 for Generation Z. Broadly speaking, the two demographic cohorts are migrating in opposite directions, with the millennials moving North and Generation Z going South.\nAverage home sizes was declining between the early- and late-2010s. Nevertheless, entry-level homes, which almost ceased to exist due to the housing bubble, started to return in numbers as builders respond to rising demand from millennials. In order to cut construction costs, builders offer few to no options for floor plans. Previously, the Great Recession forced millennials delay home ownership. But by the late 2010s, older millennials had accumulated sufficient savings and were ready to buy a home, get married, and have children. Prices have risen in the late 2010s due to high demand, but this could attract more companies to enter the business of building affordable homes.\nAs a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, interest in suburban properties skyrocketed, with millennials being the largest block of buyers. In May 2020, when the real-estate market was recovering, searches for suburban properties rose 13%, or twice the rate for urban areas. This trend was observed in more than 50 of the largest 100 American metropolitan areas. In New York City, for example, demand for apartment units in Manhattan nosedived at an annualized rate of 80% in May. As more and more people reconsider whether they would like to live in a densely populated urban environment with high-rise apartments, cultural amenities, and shared spaces rather than a suburban single-family home with their own backyard, the homebuilding industry was seeing better recovery than expected. As millennials and senior citizens increasingly demand affordable housing outside the major cities, to prevent another housing bubble, banks and regulators have restricted lending to filter out speculators and those with bad credit.\nBy the time they neared midlife in the early 2020s, the bulk of older American millennials had entered the housing market. Polling commissioned by CNBC suggested that by February 2021 59% of those born from 1981 to 1988 owned their own home. Most of this group had owned a home for more than five years whilst the vast majority had used a mortgage to help fund their purchase. However, the research also indicated that 28% of individuals in this age range were renting whilst 12% still lived with their parents or other family. Members of this cohort were less likely to be homeowners than their elders had at the same age. Individuals with tertiary education were substantially more likely to own a home than those without it. Those of black and Hispanic ethnicity were slightly less likely to be homeowners than their white counterparts. The most common reason responders gave for not having bought a home was lack of sufficient savings.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ofer Zwikael is an Australian management scientist, academic, and author. He is a professor in the Australian National University's Research School of Management.Zwikael is most known for his work in the domain of project management, in particular for his contribution to the field of project benefits management, where he developed theories, models, and practices on how managers create project value that makes a positive impact on organizations and society. Among his authored works are his publications in academic journals, including International Journal of Project Management and Journal of Operations Management as well as books such as Project Management for the Creation of Organisational Value and Project Management: A Benefit Realisation Approach. Moreover, he is the recipient of 2016 International Project Management Association (IPMA) Research Award and the 2020 Project Management Institute's David I. Cleland Project Management Literature Award.\n\n\n== Education ==\nZwikael earned his B.Sc., in Industrial Engineering from Ben Gurion University in 1993, followed by an MBA from Tel Aviv University in 1998 and a Ph.D. in 2003 from the same institution.\n\n\n== Career ==\nFrom 2006 to 2008, Zwikael was a senior lecturer at Victoria University of Wellington's Victoria Management School. He then joined the Australian National University's Research School of Management as an Associate Professor, serving from 2008 to 2019 before being promoted to Professor, a position he has held since then.Zwikael served as Associate Dean for the ANU College of Business and Economics at Australian National University from 2014 to 2016. Additionally, he held the position of Director of the Research School of Management at the same institution from 2019 to 2022.\n\n\n== Books ==\nIn 2011, Zwikael co-authored the book Project Management for the Creation of Organisational Value, in which he analyzed the shortcomings of existing project management methods and proposed enhanced processes for greater project success. Joan Dobbie, in her review commended the author for his efforts in providing a comprehensive overview of the challenges encountered in the realm of project management, accompanied by a model for effectively addressing these concerns. In 2014, he co-authored the book Challenges and Best Practices of Managing Government Projects and Programs: Theory and Practices, analyzing why government projects in sectors such as infrastructure, information systems, and defense often fail and offering strategies for improving their management and success rates. The book was reviewed by Javed Azam, who said \"The analysis and recommendations presented in the book reinforces the importance of utilizing project/program management principles and systems that would lead to successful implementation of projects and thereby, reduce and/or prevent waste of taxpayers' money in the process.\"Zwikael's 2019 award-winning book Project Management: A Benefit Realisation Approach is key resource on project benefits management. The book provides a guide for the project owner (the individual held accountable for realizing the project business case) in leading the change, the project steering committee, and the project benefits management process. His 2022 book Effective Implementation of Transformation Strategies: How to Navigate the Strategy and Change Interface Successfully explored the processes and cognitions involved in implementing strategies amidst organizational change. The book conceptualized corporate strategy through four fundamental strategies, emphasizing the importance of integrating them to achieve successful strategic change and navigating various market and non-market influences. The book was reviewed by Zhou Jiang, who said \"This is a must-read collection of papers from leading experts in strategy and change management, which bridges the worlds of academia and industry. The book is full of critical, cutting-edge and research-driven insights, enabling it to serve as a guide for leaders keen to formulate and implement strategies in dynamic business environments.\" Additionally, his work has attracted media attention, with interviews appearing in academic and practitioner magazines.\n\n\n== Research ==\nZwikael has engaged in interdisciplinary management research. His early research on project management evaluated five forecasting models for project cost estimation using real project data, identified the most accurate model, and determined the point at which its forecasts became stable and accurate. His 2006 collaborative study with S Globerson analyzed the impact of specific planning processes on project success, identified Critical Success Processes (CSP), and suggested that traditional Critical Success Factors (CSF) may have been too general to effectively support project managers' decision-making. In 2009, he collaborated with W Lipke and others, proposing a method combining earned value management, earned schedule, and statistical prediction methods to improve forecasting accuracy for final project costs and durations. Furthermore, his joint 2011 study with M Ahn revealed that even moderate levels of risk management planning can significantly reduce the negative impact of risk on project success. Zwikael explored the effectiveness of formal planning in project management, comparing traditional strategic planning with newer tactical planning approaches. His study found that while strategic planning generally holds more value, tactical planning may be counterproductive in low-risk projects, thereby highlighting the importance of adapting planning approaches based on project context.His most significant contribution to research is in the area of project benefits management. In his 2012 research, he challenged conventional project performance evaluation methods by introducing a novel framework across three distinct success dimensions, positing that this approach could enhance investment decision-making and project benefits realization. His 2015 work explored the formulation and appraisal of project target benefits, proposing a conceptual framework based on interviews with senior managers in Australia. The study also highlighted the importance of criteria such as strategic fit and measurability, as well as constructs such as formal benefit formulation processes and executive leadership, in improving organizational performance. Investigating the relationship between effective project governance, benefit management, and project success, his 2017 study proposed a model based on empirical evidence that demonstrated how effective project governance enhances project success and facilitates the achievement of strategic objectives through project benefits management. Later, together with Jack R. Meredith, he published a series of papers on the role of the project owner and their accountability for benefits realization and the delivery of the business case. First, in 2018, in their paper entitled \"Who's who in the project zoo?\", they defined the ten core project roles, including the key role of the project owner. Then, in 2019, his paper set the responsibilities of the project owner in benefits management throughout all project phases. In 2021, they developed models that evaluate the performance of the project leaders (project owner and project manager) and distinguished these performance evaluation models from measuring the success of a project. In 2023 he co-wrote an Editorial that summarized the research to date on project benefits management, identified enablers and inhibitors of project benefits management implementation, and proposed a framework for future research. Moreover, in 2024 he identified the 10 groups of project benefits to support their setting, management, and realization.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2008 – Outstanding Research Contribution, International Project Management Association\n2015 – Emerald Citations of Excellence Award, Emerald\n2016 – IPMA Research Award, International Project Management Association\n2016 – Project Management Research Award, Australian Institute of Project Management\n2020 – David I Cleland Project Management Literature Award, Project Management Institute\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Selected books ===\nProject Management for the Creation of Organisational Value (2011) ISBN 9781849965156\nChallenges and Best Practices of Managing Government Projects and Programs (2014) ISBN 9781628250657\nProject Management A Benefit Realisation Approach (2019) ISBN 9783030031732\nEffective Implementation of Transformation Strategies: How to Navigate the Strategy and Change Interface Successfully (2022) ISBN 9789811923357\n\n\n=== Selected articles ===\nZwikael, O., & Globerson, S.

        "content": "The 2024 Southend-on-Sea City Council election is scheduled to be held on Thursday 2 May 2024, alongside the other local elections in the United Kingdom being held on the same day. One-third of the 51 members of Southend-on-Sea City Council in Essex will be elected.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Conservative Party took control of Southend-on-Sea from no overall control in 2000, and governed as a majority until 2014 when they were replaced by a coalition of Labour, Liberal Democrats and independents. The Conservatives took control alongside UKIP in 2016, before regaining a majority in 2018. The Labour-Liberal Democrats-independent coalition took over in 2019, and governed until 2023. In that election, the Conservatives won 5 seats with 33.2%, Labour won 7 with 28.7%, independents won 3 with 12.3%, the Liberal Democrats won 1 with 13.2%, and the Green Party won 1 with 9.1%. The Conservatives formed a minority administration with support of some independents following this election.\nThe seats up for election in 2024 were last contested in 2021; because of the delay of all local elections due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the seats are up for election after 3 years rather than the usual 4. In that election, the Conservatives won 11 seats with 40.5%, Labour won 6 with 26.1%, independents won 1 with 13.0% and the Liberal Democrats won 1 with 11.4%.\n\n\n== Summary ==\n\n\n=== Council composition ===\n\nChanges:\n\nMay 2023: Kathy Murphy leaves Labour to sit as an independent\n\n\n=== Councillors standing down ===\n\n\n=== Candidates by party ===\n\n\n=== Election result ===\n\n\n== Candidates ==\nThe Statement of Persons Nominated, which details the candidates standing in each ward, was released by Southend-on-Sea City Council following the close of nominations on 5 April 2024.\n\n\n=== Belfairs ===\n\n\n=== Bleheim Park ===\n\n\n=== Chalkwell ===\n\n\n=== Eastwood Park ===\n\n\n=== Kursaal ===\n\n\n=== Leigh ===\n\n\n=== Milton ===\n\n\n=== Prittlewell ===\n\n\n=== Shoeburyness ===\n\n\n=== Southchurch ===\n\n\n=== St Laurence ===\n\n\n=== St Luke's ===\n\n\n=== Thorpe ===\n\n\n=== Victoria ===\n\n\n=== West Leigh ===\n\n\n=== West Shoebury ===\n\n\n=== Westborough ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Kung Kasalanan Man (English: If It's A Sin) is a 1989 Philippine thriller melodrama film directed by Eddie Garcia from a screenplay by Amado Lacuesta Jr. and Raquel Villavicencio that is based on a komiks serial of the same name written by Gilda Olvidado. It revolves around two Irmas: one is the real Irma who has owned properties and the other is Jo, the fake Irma, who is the former's high school friend who stole the former's identity by having plastic surgery after her former lover beat her and destroyed her face. The film stars Dina Bonnevie, Timmy Cruz, Tonton Gutierrez, and Julio Diaz. The film's theme song \"Kung Kasalanan Man\" is performed by Rey Valera.\nProduced and released by Viva Films, the film was theatrically released on 21 June 1989, to a critical and box office success.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIrma lives in a house with her husband Raullo Ferrer and daughter Yvette. However, after experiencing a near-death experience with the unidentified men who fired gunshots at the front of their house, she decides that she and Yvette will go to the United States. While Irma and her daughter go to America and Raullo is on a business trip in Australia, she assigns Jo, her longtime friend since high school, as a house sitter. While doing so, Jo began stealing things owned by Irma inside the house, including jewelry, fancy clothes, and her safebox. One night, when Jo reunites with her former lover Alvaro, she tries to seduce him but she ends up being severely mauled by Alvaro. Because of this, she vows to take revenge against him and his current lover.\nWith the jewelry and safebox, which contained her photos and bank accounts, that Jo stole, she succeeded in stealing Irma's identity through plastic surgery. When Jo, now the fake Irma, returns to the mansion, many people including Aling Miding thought that their employer would stay for a long time in America. By the time she received a call from the true Irma, Jo changed the house's telephone number (to which Irma's aunt, Tiya Bining, complained), transferred Irma's bank accounts from a bank she is a loyal client of to a new one, and replaced Aling Miding and her fellow house helpers with different people. One night, the fake Irma succeeds in killing Alvaro at the hotel and his girlfriend at their house. The following day, Raullo returned home from his business trip, only to be refused to let him in by the new house helpers and met his demise when unknown assailants shot him to death. At the hospital, it was revealed that Alvaro survived and he found the identity of a woman who stabbed him in a newspaper and unknown to him, she is Jo.\nOn the day of Raullo's funeral, Dan Ramirez, Irma's former lover, shows up and begins a new relationship with the fake Irma. When the true Irma and her daughter Yvette returned to the Philippines, Tiya Bining and Aling Miding realized that they were in America and informed Irma about a string of events that occurred during their absence including Raullo's death. When Tiya Bining shows Irma and Yvette their house, Irma sadly realizes that their house was sold to a different person. At her lawyer's office, Irma was informed by Atty. Rafael Castro about her forthcoming wedding which confuses her. At the church, the true Irma found out that Jo stole her identity and married Dan.\nBecause of the return of the true Irma, the fake Irma anonymously calls Alvaro, who has visible facial scars, and gives him the address of the true Irma, who temporarily stays at her aunt's house. One morning, the two Irmas face each other, to which the true Irma angrily calls Jo an \"impostor\". Later, Irma returns home, only to be kidnapped by Alvaro, who takes her to a dilapidated house. When Irma regained consciousness, Alvaro attempts to rape her violently as an act of revenge but the latter escaped successfully. On the following day, Irma visits Dan at the office, only for Dan to realize that she is the true Irma while the Irma whom he marries is Jo.\nWith Dan realizing that he is married to the fake Irma, he makes a plan to leave the country with the true Irma and Yvette. While the three stay at the hotel, the fake Irma shows up. On the same night, Alvaro notices the van, which Tiya Bining is inside, and starts following them to the hotel. While intruding on their hotel room, the fake Irma shoots the true Irma and exits. Unfortunately for the fake Irma, Alvaro starts shooting at her.\nThe gunfight continues when the fake Irma tries to escape at the emergency stairwell and Alvaro follows her, followed by Dan. When she accidentally slipped on the stairs, Alvaro shot the fake Irma to death and left the scene after he finished the job.\nFortunately, the true Irma survived the attempted fatal shooting by Jo, much to Dan's relief. On the next day, Irma, Dan, and Yvette leave the hotel and give farewell to Tiya Bining before they go to Paris. Alvaro, who is in his car, notices Irma in a taxi, whom he sees is alive, and wants to finish her. However, it never materialized as he realized that they had gone to the airport and moved on. The film ends with the plane bound for France taking off.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\nOther cast includes Suzanne Gonzales as Alvaro's girlfriend, Ernie Zarate as the plastic surgeon, Koko Trinidad as Atty. Rafael P. Castro, Irma's lawyer, and Merla Verdeflor as Mrs. Domingo.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKung Kasalanan Man at IMDb",

It was one of their most popular works.\nThe Brisbane Courier said \"The performance...  went very well through-out, and was freely applauded, the various thrilling events of the drama being graphically portrayed by the various members of the company, who seemed thoroughly at home in their delineations of the rougher parts of bush life.\"The Melbourne Herald noted that \"a departure from the usual rule observed in dealing with the bushrangers is made, in that the police are not held up to ridicule, but are treated with a respect not always accorded the \"force.\"... The author has striven to portray the history of the outlaws, as far as the stage allows, rather than to present overdrawn, sensational pictures.\"There were performances in 1903, 1904, 1907 (In Melbourne and Sydney) and 1909.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nACT I – Scene 1: Kelly’s Home at Greta – The Warrant.

        "content": "Vanessa Toulmin (born 1967) is an English academic specialising in popular culture. She is Professor and Director of City Culture and Public Engagement at the University of Sheffield, and founded the National Fairground and Circus Archive (NFCA) at the University of Sheffield. She is chair of the Morecambe Winter Gardens Preservation Trust.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nToulmin was born in 1967 in Morecambe, Lancashire, where her mother's family ran the fairground behind Morecambe Winter Gardens. Her mother was from a  show family, the O'Connors. The family left Morecambe when she was eight years old, after her grandparents died, and Toulmin took part in travelling fairground life, selling candyfloss and working on children's rides around Lancashire and Wales with her uncles' and aunts' fairs.\nToulmin studied archaeology at the University of Sheffield. She has a PhD (1997) from Sheffield; her 1997 doctoral thesis was \"Fun without vulgarity : community, women and language in Showland Society\", and her research was carried out in the Centre for English Cultural Tradition and Language. She was awarded the university's Chancellor's Medal, which \"is awarded for outstanding attainment in academic, sporting and other personal achievements\".\n\n\n== Career ==\nWhile working on her PhD, Toulmin set up the National Fairground Archive in the University Library, working with the Showmen's Guild of Great Britain and the Fairground Association of Great Britain, and was its first director. The archive received a grant from the National Heritage Lottery Fund to digitise its photographic collection. In 2000, she submitted a memorandum to the House of Commons Select Committee on Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs, on the topic of the value of travelling fairs and the needs of travelling showpeople. She led a project team looking at \"COVID-19 and Sheffield's cultural sector: planning for recovery\", and together with Sarah Price submitted evidence from this work to Parliament.\nIn 2007, Toulmin was appointed Professor of Early Film and Popular Entertainment at the University of Sheffield, the first chair in this subject in a British university.\nShe is a director of the university's Festival of the Mind, established in 2011.\nIn 2020 she became chair of the Morecambe Winter Gardens Preservation Trust, which is restoring this celebrated theatre. The University of Sheffield supports her work in this voluntary role. She has said that she hopes the restored building will become \"the biggest venue between Preston and Cumbria\".  The volunteers of the trust were collectively awarded the King's Award for Voluntary Service in November 2023.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nToulmin, Vanessa (1998).

        "content": "The 1996 Milwaukee mayoral election was held on March 19, 1996, to elect the mayor of Milwaukee. Incumbent mayor John Norquist was re-elected to a third term in office.\n\n\n== Candidates ==\nRichard Artison, former sheriff of Milwaukee County (1984–1995) and former U.S. Secret Service agent\nJohn Norquist, incumbent mayor since 1988\n\n\n== Campaign ==\nIncumbent mayor John Norquist had first been elected in 1988. His 1988 candidacy was boosted by support from a coalition of liberal-leaning white voters and black voters. Norquist was generally described to be a political progressive on maters such as transit, employment policies, and environmentalism; as well as a believer in new urbanism. However, he also held certain positions that departed from the city's prior liberal orthodoxy, including his stances in support of ending welfare and cutting the city's budget. While generally popular, Norquist had political opposition, including from police, teachers, and other municipal unions, particularly due to the implementation of a requirement that city and school district employees be residents of the city.\nNorquist's sole challenger was Artison, the former sheriff of Milwaukee County. Artison, the first black person to serve as a sheriff in the state of Wisconsin, was seeking to make history again by being elected Milwaukee's first black mayor. Artson had served as sheriff from 1984 until retiring form that office in 1995, having been elected as a Democrat to six consecutive two-year terms. An October 1995 opinion poll showed Norquist and Artison to be the city's two most popularly-liked elected officials.  Norquist and Artison both advanced from the primary to the two-candidate general election.\nThe campaign did not take a racial or overly negative tone. This was in contrast to the negative and racial tone of the coinciding circuit court election between incumbent Russell Stamper (who was black) and white opponent Robert Crawford (who was white).\nNorquist's candidacy likely benefited from his incumbency, as incumbents rarely had been unseated in Milwaukee mayoral elections. A scientific exit poll indicated that Norquist voters' decision had been most motivated by a belie that he was the candidate who was \"most competent for the job [of mayor]\".\n\n\n== Opinion polls ==\nAn October 1995 poll of a head-to-head matchup between Norquist and Artison showed Norquist receiving 48% of support and Artison receiving 40% of support among likely voters.\n\n\n== Result ==\n\n\n== References ==",

His Histoire des papes was sometimes printed anonymously. Imperial librarian A. A. Barbier wrote of it: \"this wretched book, the fruit of a young man's enthusiasm and anger, is an indigestible collection of all the most satirical things ever written against the leaders of the Roman Church. The incorrect, disjointed and grovelling style is only enhanced by coarse language that could only have pleased the Protestant rabble.\"\nAfter converting, François Bruys moved to the Netherlands and developed a literary career. He published critiques of Jacques Saurin, another convert who had been a priest and then became a pastor of the Reformed Church of France. He died in Dijon.\nIn his book on The Art of Knowing Women, \"Francois Bruys triumphantly skewers the glaring failure of makeup to mask age and ugliness in women.\"\n\n\n== Works ==\nHistoire des papes, La Haye 1732–1734.

        "content": "Zhou Ming (Chinese: 周明; pinyin: Zhōu Míng) is a Chinese computer scientist, linguist, and technology executive.\n\n\n== Background ==\nZhou received his doctorate in computer science from Harbin Institute of Technology in 1991. During his studies, he played a role by developing CEMT-I, one of the earliest Chinese-English machine translation systems in China. Following his PhD, he joined Tsinghua University, where he led the development of J-Beijing, a Sino-Japanese machine translation system that achieved recognition in Japan.\nHis research focuses on machine translation, language learning, text generation, chatbots, and pre-trained models. He has published over 200 research papers cited more than 30,000 times and holds over 60 international patents. Notably, his group's demonstration of a speech-to-speech English-Chinese translation system at the Microsoft Research Asia's 21st Century Computing Conference in 2012 significantly spurred research on speech-to-speech translation using deep learning techniques.\nZhou has served the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) community. He held positions on the executive committee and served as the president of ACL. He also played a key role in establishing the ACL Asia-Pacific Chapter (AACL), which has significantly promoted both ACL and NLP research in the Asia-Pacific region. Additionally, he has held leadership positions in program and general committees for numerous NLP and AI conferences such as ACL, EMNLP, COLING, and IJCNLP. Zhou has also served as program-committee chair, general chair, or area chair of NLP and AI conferences like ACL, EMNLP, COLING, IJCNLP, MT SUMMIT, AAAI, IJCAI, AIRS, and NLPCC. He was the associate editor of the TALLIP journal, and an editorial board member of the Computational Linguistics and Machine Translation journals.\n\n\n== Academic activities & awards ==\nVP, China Computer Federation (CCF), 2020–2024\nFellow, Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2023\nFellow, Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence (CAAI), 2021\nFellow, China Computer Federation, 2020\nPresident, Association for Computational Linguistics, 2019\nWuzhen Internet Leading Technology Award, 2019 - UniLM\nAsian Innovation Readers’ Choice Award, Wall Street Journal, 2010 - Engkoo\nMakoto Nagao Award, Japan Machine Translation Association, 2008 - J-Beijing/J-Server\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMing Zhou’s Publications \nDr. Ming Zhou Archived December 14, 2020, at the Wayback Machine",

        "content": "NGC 7682 is a barred spiral galaxy in the constellation Pisces. It is located at a distance of circa 180 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 7682 is about 65,000 light years across. It was discovered by Heinrich d'Arrest on September 23, 1864.\nThe galaxy has a bar and two weak spiral arms which form a ring. The nucleus of NGC 7682 has been found to be active and has been categorised as a type 2 Seyfert galaxy. The most accepted theory for the energy source of Seyfert galaxies is the presence of an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole. The supermassive hole in the nucleus of NGC 7682 is estimated to be 17–62 million (107.56±0.33) M☉. Ionised H-alpha, [N II] and [O III] gas has been detected along with [Ne V], [Si VI] and [Si VIII]. Ionization cones are observed north and south of the nucleus. A jet was reported to be present in H-alpha and NII imaging by W. C. Keel in 1985 but further observations didn't confirm its presence.\nNGC 7682 forms a pair with NGC 7679. NGC 7682 lies at a distance of 269.7 arcseconds, which corresponds to a projected distance of 97 kpc. The two galaxies are connected by a hydrogen bridge, a sign of a closer encounter in the past 500 million years. It is possible that the interaction of the two galaxies caused star formation in NGC 7679.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to NGC 7682 at Wikimedia Commons\nNGC 7682 on WikiSky: DSS2, SDSS, GALEX, IRAS, Hydrogen α, X-Ray, Astrophoto, Sky Map, Articles and images",

        "content": "Richard Morton is a British comedian, musician, songwriter, and composer from North East England who became known as a founder member of the London Comedy Store’s \"Cutting Edge\" show. He is best known as a 1992 winner of the Time Out Comedy Award, one half of musical act The Panic Brothers and for The Jack Dee Show (ITV) and The Comedy Store TV series on Channel 5.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMorton was born in Singapore moving to Newcastle, in North East England and then Hexham, Northumberland. He attended the Queen Elizabeth High School, Hexham\nAfter gigging with several rock bands in his native North East, Morton moved to London in the late 1970s to pursue his music, and later, comedy career.\n\n\n== Music career / The Panic Brothers ==\nMorton initially worked as a musician, touring pubs and small venues, but became a comedian “by default”: “I'd lark around on stage, not finishing the songs properly. It's difficult to stand in such an intimate venue and pretend to be David Bowie. So I started chatting to the audience and making them laugh.”\nIn 1985, having been signed by a management company, Morton formed the close harmony singing duo The Panic Brothers with singer/songwriter Reg Meuross. Beginning on the London pub rock circuit, they established themselves as a live act, supporting musicians and comedians and appearing at the GLC Farewell Festival.\nJohn Conquest wrote in Time Out magazine in June 1987: “Their combination of sharp, witty songs, tight harmonies and powerful acoustic guitars have gained them an enormous following.”  Mark Kermode said: \"I [fell] in love with The Panic Brothers, a duo who looked and sounded like The Everly Brothers but with a post-punk twist. I would sit there studying their act, marvelling at their musical brilliance, mesmerised by their comic timing.\"\nIn 1987 The Panic Brothers released a vinyl mini LP, In The Red (Topic Records), produced by Clive Gregson and featuring guest musicians including Geraint Watkins and BJ Cole. It was used as the soundtrack for the TV play Biting The Hand, part of BBC One drama series The Play On One. Andy White wrote in Music Week in November 1987: “Excellent snappy songs, booming acoustic guitars and perfect harmonies are the Panic’s trademarks.”\nMorton and Meuross’ act featured at the 1987 Edinburgh Festival Fringe with Norman Lovett, and they later performed a three-week run with Mark Steel at The Assembly Rooms, followed by a UK tour. In 1989, they performed their own show, The Panic Brothers Hold Their Own.\nThe duo appeared on a host of TV shows, most famously Friday Night Live hosted by Ben Elton. They were special guests in At Home With The Hardys, at The Lyric, Hammersmith starring Jeremy Hardy, Kit Hollerbach, Paul B Davies and Caroline Eddy.\nThe act disbanded in 1990, but reformed for a series of reunion gigs in 2014 coinciding with the release of their digitally re-mastered album.\n\n\n== Musical comedy career ==\nWorking solo, Morton came to prominence as a musical comedian in the British alternative comedy scene of the late eighties and early nineties and was a founder member of The Comedy Store's Cutting Edge show along with Mark Thomas, Kevin Day, Dave Cohen, Bob Boyton, and Linda Smith. He performed regularly at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe between 1990 and 2001, both with his own show and with fellow comedians including Jenny Lecoat, Fred MacAulay, Lynn Ferguson and Jo Brand. He featured in numerous Best Of The Fest shows at the Playhouse Theatre. A Sunday Times review by Mark Edwards at the time said, \"The audience laughed longer and louder at Morton than at any other comedian I've seen at the Fringe.\"\nMorton was a winner of the Time Out Comedy Award in 1992. The Awards ran from 1991 to 2006 and were bestowed by the London listings magazine Time Out. The judges awarded Morton Time Out Comedy Awards “For his comic songs and all-round talent as a comedian, together with his ability to achieve striking collaborations with other performers.”\nIn Autumn 1994 Morton headlined his own UK tour.\nMorton supported comedians including Lee Evans and Jack Dee where he was described as \"the most adept support act on the circuit\". His regular spot in the show saw him described as \"the perfect foil for Dee, who owes him a significant debt for Morton's effervescent, life-affirming act complements Dee's caustic observations like a refreshing aperatif before a hearty meal.\"  He was also warm-up act for Peter Kay’s Comedy Store Channel 5 TV Special.\nIn her book Can't Stand Up for Sitting Down, Jo Brand said: \"I toured for a while with Richard Morton, who was always great to be with. Richard is such a lovable guy so helpful, friendly and sweet natured. He almost makes me feel guilty for existing. He’s a Geordie, but an atypical one given that he is small and slim and unmacho. He was unerringly cheerful when we toured and believe you me unerringly cheerful isn’t the default position of most comedians.\"\nOn TV and radio Morton was a guest on Nothing Like A Royal Show (ITV) performing the comedy song My Daddy Was A Sperm Bank and The Jack Dee Show (ITV) performing \"The Bobbit Song\". He was a regular contributor to Loose Ends (Radio 4) hosted by Ned Sherrin, and guested on popular comedy panel game show Just A Minute.\nIn 1995 Morton took a role in the Bafta Award-winning series Our Friends in the North (BBC 2), and later acted in several episodes of mockumentary series Jack & Jeremy's Real Lives (Channel 4), as well as composing a title song for their earlier show, Jack and Jeremy's Police 4.\nMorton appeared in his own Channel 5 Comedy Store Special in 1997, going on to feature in three series of the show. He had regular guest spots on a range of Channel 5 panel shows including Bring Me the Head of Light Entertainment, Tibs & Fibs, Live & Dangerous, Night Fever, The Jack Docherty Show and was a regular panellist on two series of WowFabGroovy!.\nAlso for Channel 5, Morton presented the quiz series Move On Up, and co-presented Win Beadle's Money.\nMorton hosted a six-part series Stand Up 2 (Radio 2) featuring Barry Cryer and Ross Noble and was a weekly panellist on the series Cross-Questioned (Radio 4) hosted by Caroline Quentin. In the early 2000s, he was a regular guest on the musically themed show, Jammin’.\nMorton returned to music in 2010, forming The Rich Morton Sound with musician/producer Dave O’Brien. They released a concept album, The Theme That Never Was, featuring newly composed instrumental themes for imaginary films and TV shows of the 60s and 70s.\nThe record was released on their own label, Homage To Fromage, and distributed worldwide by Proper Records. The track Storm the Embassy featured on The Word magazine CD Now Hear This in March 2010. In 2013, they released the follow-up album, The Sequel That Never Was.\nMorton composed the theme for the Vic Reeves’ Radio 2 series Does the Team Think… and his track Colour Me Groovy was used both as the theme for two series of Bennett Arron Worries About... on BBC Radio Wales and the You Heard It Here First podcast for BBC Comedy of the Week. He co-wrote the song, Lard with Jo Brand for her Channel 4 special All the Way To Worcester and Can't Help Crying At Christmas, with Rich Hall and Andy Davies for Jack Dee's Sunday Service.\nMorton wrote and presented documentaries for BBC Radio 4: In The Lounge With Rich Morton which remains available on BBC iPlayer, I Can’t Stand Up For Falling Down, The Lost Art of the TV Theme as well as appearing in Fred At The Stand.  He presented Ho’way The Laughs, a two part series about Geordie comedy.\n\n\n== References ==",

The remains of the synagogue that is one of two public buildings discovered on the site, were first discovered by Lawrence Oliphant at the end of the 19th century. After 1967 the site was part of a survey conductaed on the Golan Heights. In the 21st century the synagogue was excavated and then restored.\n\n\n== Archeology ==\nIn 1998 an excavation expedition was organized on behalf of the Department of Land of Israel Studies and Archeology at Bar-Ilan University and Kinneret College led by Haim Ben David, Zvi Uri Maoz and Oren Zingboim. Excavations were carried out at the site until 2004. The excavations revealed a rectangular hall (basilica) measuring 11 meters by 18 meters, with a pile of ashlar stones, which according to information originate from the synagogue that was destroyed in the 749 CE earthquake. Under the floor of the hall, hundreds of coins were found, the latest of which date from the time of Justinian I, emperor of the Byzantine Empire (second quarter of the 6th century AD). In the southern wall of the hall there is a prominent niche for the Torah ark. Further more a Menorah and an Atarah (Hebrew word meaning \"crown\") were found engraved on a stoneOn one of the windows of the synagogue is the inscription in Greek: ΑΖΙΖΟ, indicating that there is a possibility that the name \"Aziz\" is related to the original name of the Talmudic settlement in the place.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Conscription in Myanmar has a long history.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Tatmadaw — the name traditionally given to the military of Myanmar which has ruled the country intermittently since independence - has long used \"forced recruitment\" of citizens without formal conscription laws. A 1955 \"National Service Bill\" was taken to parliament, but due to legal complexities, it is unclear whether it actually entered into force. The main bulk of the military continued to be recruited \"almost entirely from volunteers\", with the bill's provisions used only for recruitment of \"technical specialists, such as doctors and engineers\".However, after the 8888 Uprising in 1988, the Burmese military began utilizing \"forced recruitment and deceptive tactics\" to quietly enlist young men, including minors, into its forces. This did not occur in accordance with the 1955 bill, and \"did not occur pursuant to any compulsory military service laws but was essentially arbitrary\", according to a 1988 report by the International Labor Organization of the United Nations. Despite continued manpower shortages, the military did not enact formal mandatory conscription for decades.On November 4, 2010, the State Peace and Development Council military regime enacted a formalized conscription law, which elicited extremely negative reactions from the public. The military regime soon lost power after the subsequent elections, and the \"quasi-civilian governments\" that replaced it opted to leave the law unenforced.In 2021, the Tatmadaw staged a coup d'etat, and established a new military junta known as the State Administration Council, leading to an escalation of Myanmar's long-running internal conflicts into a civil war. Over the following few years, the Tatmadaw suffered numerous military setbacks at the hands of anti-junta insurgent forces, losing control over vast areas of the country. On 10 February 2024, the junta announced that two years of military service would be mandatory for all men between the ages of 18 and 35 and all women between the ages of 18 and 27. Tatmadaw spokesman Zaw Min Tun said that around a fourth of Myanmar's population would be eligible under the law, which was planned to come into effect after the Burmese New Year in mid-April 2024.The announcement has led to a wave of young people fleeing the country to evade conscription.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Presidential elections were held in the disputed Russian republic of Chechnya on 5 October 2003, amidst the Second Chechen War. Held six months after a three-part constitutional referendum, the election was reported as a success for Russian-backed candidate Akhmad Kadyrov, who reportedly won with 84% of the vote and 88% turnout.\nEarly candidates in the election besides Kadyrov included Aslambek Aslakhanov, Malik Saidullaev, and Umar Dzhabrailov. However, by the time of the election any significant candidates besides Kadyrov had dropped out. The election was marked by a lack of violent incidents, though among the incidents that did occur was a skirmish in Grozny and a mine clearing operation in Samashki. The election was boycotted by international monitors such as the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, who argued that a free and fair election was impossible under Chechnya's conditions. Representatives of the Moscow Helsinki Group, Arab League, Organisation of the Islamic Conference, and the Commonwealth of Independent States assessed the vote, and Moscow Helsinki Group head Lyudmila Alexeyeva described the vote as free and fair, though she criticised the conditions of the vote as causing voters to fear retaliation for their votes. Despite claims by the Russian government to the contrary, several polling stations were reported as being empty by independent media.\nIn addition to residents of Chechnya, Russian soldiers and Chechen refugees in the neighbouring republic of Ingushetia were permitted to vote.\nFew commentators within Chechen or Russian media spheres expected any significant change to emerge from the election, according to Reuters. The government of the breakaway Chechen Republic of Ichkeria rejected the results, with representative Akhmed Zakayev saying that \"Mr Kadyrov is, and will continue to be, an appointed head of the regime.\"\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Geçki is the usage of a different makam during the performance of another makam, which may or may not lead to a modulation. It is a form of modal interchange, used specifically within Turkish makam music.\n\n\n== Music theory ==\nAs with modal interchange, it is easier to do a geçki between two similar makams. There are two forms of geçki, the ones that create a change in function and the ones that create a change in identity. These two forms of geçki can be used simultaneously.\n\n\n=== Change in function ===\nA geçki can happen without changing any notes by changing the roles of the notes within a makam. Neva and Hüseynî share many of their features, including their notes. However, Neva has its Güçlü in its fourth note, while Hüseynî has its Güçlü in its fifth note. So performing the fifth note as a Güçlü while performing the Neva makam is an example of a Hüseynî geçki within a Neva makam.\nA geçki can also happen through the change in the Durak (the tonic note). The Rast makam can be reached by making the Yeden (the leading tone) of the Uşşak makam into the current Durak. This is because the lower pentachord of Rast functions as a mode of the lower tetrachord (including the Yeden) of Uşşak.\nA visualisation of how the geçki between Hicaz and Nikriz would work can be seen below. Changing the Durak note from the 1st to the 2nd note (or vice-versa) would be a geçki between these makams.\n\n\n=== Change in identity ===\nGeçki can also happen through changing a note in a makam and thereby modulating it into a different makam. This change is usually done through the use of accidentals.\nAn example of this is a geçki between Rast and Basit Suzinak. While performing, if one were to flat the 6th note of Rast, they would get Basit Suzinak.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Piliers de Tutelle (meaning Pillars of Guardianship in French) was an important Gallo-Roman monument erected in the third century on the approximate location of the southwest corner of the Grand Théâtre of Bordeaux, a city in southwestern France. It was built around the late second century or early third century BC during the Roman period in France, and shares many features with similar pillared porticos and colonnades of the same period in other lands of the Roman Empire.\nThe tall, rectangular monument was composed of twenty-four tall columns topped by an architrave, and enhanced by an arcaded crowning decorated with bas reliefs on forty-four bilateral pillars placed above. The reliefs dpicted young women standing upright (caryatids).\nIt was demolished in early 1677 during the transformation of Trompette Castle into a bastioned citadel by orders of the king of France, Louis XIV, known as the Sun King. Today the Piliers is only known through old engravings and contemporary testimonies of the time. \n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Pillars of Guardianship were a Gallo-Roman monument in the Severian style made up of twent-four Corinthian-style columns arranged in a rectangle. The plan and overall appearance of the structure, which is no longer preserved, has been handed down thanks to a drawing by architect Claude Perrault (1613-1688). It was a rectangular building, 30 meters long and 20 meters wide, supported by a double stylobate. It was made up of twenty-four columns, arranged eight lengthwise by six widthwise. The columns were twelve meters high, with a diameter of 1,35 meters and an intercolumn of 2.10 meters.\nOn top of the capitals of the columns laid an architrave, and on top of it were 44 pillars with bas reliefs of caryatids (female figures supporting a construction), one above each column and three meters in height in total. Above each female figure was a vase-shaped relief, and even higher than those were the transoms of large arches. Above those arches ran a second architrave, similar to the first one. The pillars with the reliefs were bilateral, meaning that the interior of the Piliers de Tutelle sported the same caryatids, vases and arches.\nThe building had a total height of twenty-six meters. The absence of a frame and roof is ground-breaking, because then buttresses would have been necessary given the height and width of the building. \nOn the side facing the city, twenty-one steps created a 3.30-meter tall staircase, whose height was even greater on the side towards the Garonne river, due to the natural slope of the terrain.\nUnder the double stylobate was a long, vaulted room, the ancient work of which still existed at the time of Élie Vinet (1509-1587).\nThe study of the lapidary collection kept at the Aquitaine Museum in Bordeaux made it possible to highlight a set of blocks that could belong to an elevation of the monument as described by Claude Perrault. These blocks are pieces of columns leaning against a wall, which could belong to a cella, which would attest to a religious function of the building.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Piliers de Tutelle were built around the late second or early third century under the Severan dynasty which brought the region a period of prosperity from which Bordeaux greatly benefited. \nThe Pillars have long been considered to have been a temple dedicated to the tutelary goddess of the city of Bordeaux, hence the name given to them, though the notable absence of framework and roof is more reminiscent of part of the forum of the Roman city, especially since it was located on the highest point of the city, overlooking the river and its port. However, recent excavations in 2003 made it possible to discover a peribolos, which confirms that it indeed functioned as a temple.\n\nIn the middle of the 9th century, the Arab geographer Al-Himyarī described this monument for the first time, writing that \"north of Bordeaux is a building that can be seen from afar and which rests on tall, thick columns: this was the palace of Titus\".\nThe building, already in a very poor condition, was finally razed to the ground in February 1677 by Vauban on the orders of Louis XIV who wished, after the troubles of the Fronde and the bloody revolt of the populace, to clear the glacis of the Trompette Castle in order to facilitate the firing of cannons at the rebellious city.\nIn 1930, long after the demolishing of the ancient monument, French archaeologist Paul Perdrizet noted its architectural connection to the similar (but much smaller) remains of a pillared Roman portico from Thessalonica known as Las Incantadas, which was also made up of tall columns, an architrave above them and pillars with reliefs on top (though no arcade was preserved, or even known to have existed at all). Las Incantadas was too demolished in 1864, when Frenchman Emmanuel Miller brought it down in order to transfer its pillars with the sculptures to France. They still remain in the Louvre to this day. The Piliers de Tutelle was also compared to the so-called \"Portico of the Giants\" from the Odeon of Agrippa in the Ancient Agora of Athens.\nThe Place de la Comédie sits now on the spot the Pillars once stood. They were located at the western end of the Grand Théâtre terrace, facing rue Mautrec. All that remains now are old engravings and a street that bears their name.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nBarraud, Dany; Caillabet-Duloum, Geneviève (2007). Burdigala.

        "content": "The King of the Road is a 1900 Australian play performed by Edward Irham Cole performed by Cole's Bohemian Drama Company about the bushranger Ben Hall.\nThe play appears to have debuted in 1900. According to one description the play was \"founded on episodes in the careers of the old time bushrangers Ben Hall, Frank Gardiner and the gangs that, in the days before telegraphs and railway extension, kept parts of this colony and Victoria in a state of terrorism.\" The play featured the death of Hall.\nThe play was part of Cole's repertoire of plays for the next decade. There were seasons in Sydney in 1904, 1906, 1907, and 1908.\nThe play was also performed in Melbourne. There were performances of the play as late as 1916.\nLead roles were usually played by Cole and his wife Vene Linden. Sometimes the lead was played by Cole's son-in-law Bill Ayr.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nReviewing a 1908 production the Bulletin said the play \"makes the blood-guilty Benjamin a sympathetic character–in a word, a Hero. The Hippodrome Ben is no common malefactor. He smokes not, neither does he swear or spit... Ben’s strong points are Manliness (on Manliness Benjamin is a veritable whale) and a certain maudlin and a illogical sentimentality which keeps him in a  simmering fever-heat of trouble.\"\nLooking at the same production the Sydney Morning Herald said \"The piece is full of sensational incidents and was well interpreted by the company.\"\nCole and his company performed another play about Hall, Ransom which they later filmed as Bushranger's Ransom, or A Ride for Life.\nJohn Gavin later made a 1911 film about Hall's associate Frank Gardiner, Frank Gardiner, the King of the Road.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mama's Sleeping Scarf is a 2023 children picture book written by Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie under the pseudonym Nwa Grace-James and illustrated by Congolese-Angolan illustrator Joelle Avelino.\nIt tells the story of a child who gets pacified using the scarf of mother. Receiving mixed reviews, the book was written to document the memories of Adichie's daughter.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe story follows Chino, a young child who longs for the warmth of her mother who had left early in the morning. Chino finds her mother's scarf which pacifies her. She then spends the day wit her grandparents and father until her mother returns in the evening.\n\n\n== Writing and publication ==\nChimamanda Ngozi Adichie writing as Nwa Grace-James wanted to write a children book but was hesitant and was worried that \"she would have somebody die\" as she thought that her creativity was \"too dark\". Adichie finally conceived the idea to write a children book in order to document the memories of her child but started writing when her child was four years old; Adichie then left the book for two more years and resumed writing after the death of her father. The first two draft of the book was canceled by Adichie because it bored her daughter who the main character—Chino—was based on.\nAccording to Adichie, several illustration samples was sent to her but that of Avelino was what she thought captured African life.\nThe book was published on 5 September 2023 as the first publication in a three-book deal with HarperCollins Children's Books in the UK and Knopf in the US. The Spanish edition, El pañuelo de mamá was published in February 2024. Mama's Sleeping Scarf was published in hardcover and eBook formats and as audio-book by Penguin Random House.\nFollowing the publication, Adichie held a book launch with the theme \"Christmas Magic with Chimamanda\" which was held in Lagos to celebrate her first children's book.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nKirkus Reviews praised the \"bright, fantastical backgrounds with repeating circular patterns\" while noting that the book \"is a cozy read-aloud to help little ones wind down before a nap or bed.\" While Publishers Weekly called a \"straightforward yet lively telling\". In a mixed review, Chinelo Eze of The Guardian reviewed \"[i]t would have been nice to see more adventure and substance in some of the scenes\" before concluding it is \"a treasure for mothers looking for the perfect bonding moments with their daughters, and it is a tale that is not so unfamiliar for a child.\"\nIt was listed on Publishers Weekly's \"New and Noteworthy Children's and YA Books\" of September 2023, The Guardian’s \"Best New Picture Books and Novels\", and The Independent’s \"5 New Books To Read This Week\" where it received a 7/10 rating.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The Chiswick House Gardens form the grounds of Chiswick House, now in West London, England. Lord Burlington first arranged the gardens in the 1720s to match his ideas of the gardens of classical times and the Palladianism of the house. In the 1730s, William Kent created England's first landscape garden in part of the area. The gardens have influenced garden design across Britain.\nWith changes in ownership, the gardens fell into decay; a restoration effort was made in the 1950s, and another began in 1988, continuing since then.\n\n\n== A garden of ancient Rome ==\n\nThe gardens at Chiswick were an attempt to symbolically recreate a garden of ancient Rome; these were believed to have followed the form of the gardens of Greece. The gardens, like the villa, were inspired by the architecture and gardens of ancient Rome, such as the Emperor Hadrian's Villa Adriana at Tivoli, from which the three statues at the end of the exedra (according to Daniel Defoe) were alleged to have come.\nThe gardens at Chiswick were originally of a standard Jacobean design, but from the 1720s they were in a constant state of transition. Burlington and Kent experimented with new designs, incorporating such diverse elements as mock fortifications, a Ha-ha, classical fabriques, statues, groves, faux Egyptian objects, bowling greens, winding walks, cascades and water features.\n\nAuthors of antiquity, such as Horace and Pliny, were major influences on 18th century thinkers through their descriptions of their own gardens, with alleys shaded by trees, parterres, topiary, and fountains. The first architect of the gardens at Chiswick appears to have been the king's gardener, Charles Bridgeman, who was believed to have worked on the gardens with Lord Burlington around 1720, and subsequently with William Kent, whom Lord Burlington had brought back with him on his return from his second Grand Tour in 1719. William Kent was inspired by the landscape paintings of the French artists Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain. The poet Alexander Pope (who had his own villa with gardens in nearby Twickenham), was involved, and was responsible for confirming Lord Burlington's belief that Roman and Greek gardens were largely \"informal\" affairs, with nature ruled by God.\nEvidence for this belief was provided through his translation into English of Homer's cornerstones of European literature The Iliad and The Odyssey which provided brief glimpses of Greek gardens which gave validation to Burlington's belief in the naturalistic appearance of Roman gardens. Theatrical aspects were added to the gardens by William Kent, who studied the theatre and masque designs of Inigo Jones for the Stuart Court, which were owned by Lord Burlington and housed within his villa. Burlington, Kent and Pope were informed by the writings of Anthony Ashley Cooper who advocated \"variety\" in a garden, but not complete deformalisation.\n\n\n== Garden buildings ==\n\nThe gardens at Chiswick were filled with fabriques (decorative garden buildings) which illustrated Lord Burlington's knowledge of Roman, Greek, Egyptian and Renaissance architecture, and statues and architecture which expressed his Whig (and very possibly Jacobite) ideals.\nLord Burlington's garden at Chiswick was one of the first to include garden buildings and ancient statues to evoke the mood and appearance of ancient Rome. Soon, other English gardens such as Stourhead, Stowe, West Wycombe, Holkham, and Rousham followed suit, creating a type of garden which became known internationally as the English Landscape Garden. Lord Burlington's gardens at Chiswick had a number of these fabriques including the Ionic Temple, Bagnio, Pagan Temple, Rustic House, and two Deer Houses.\nBeyond the exedra in the gardens lies an area known as the 'Orange Tree Garden' in which was situated a small garden building known as the Ionic Temple. The Ionic Temple is circular in form and is derived from either the Pantheon in Rome or possibly the Temple of Romulus. The portico is derived from the Temple of Portunus which Kent illustrates in the ceiling of the Red Velvet Room within the Villa. Immediately in front of the Temple lies a circular pool of water with a small obelisk positioned in its centre. Around the base of the pool are three concentric rings of raised grass, conforming originally to a 3:4:5 ratio, echoing the dimensions of the Red and Green Velvet Rooms within the Villa. A second obelisk was erected at the centre of another patte d'oie ('Goose Foot', a set of paths converging at a point) beyond the cascade to the west of the Villa.\n\nA theatre of hedges known as an exedra was designed by Kent and originally displayed ancient statues of three unknown Roman gentlemen. These three statues were later speculatively 'identified' by the writer Daniel Defoe (1659–1731) as Caesar (100–44 BC) and Pompey (106–48 BC) responsible for the decline of the Roman republic, facing a statue of Cicero (106–43 BC), the defender of the Republic. In 1733,  Burlington resigned his positions within the government and went into active opposition against Robert Walpole, Britain's first Prime Minister who Burlington regarded as corrupting British politics and Whig values. However, it was the figures of the poets Horace, Homer and Virgil, the philosopher Socrates, and the leaders Lucius Verus and Lycurgus which once graced the exedra whose political message was one of democracy and anti-tyranny. (William Kent made a similar statement against Walpole for Lord Cobham. The original design by Kent for the end of the exedra was a stone 'Temple of Worthies' which was rejected by  Burlington, but subsequently used by Cobham at Stowe).\n\nKent added a cascade (a symbolic grotto), inspired by the upper cascade of the gardens of the Villa Aldobrandini. Kent added a flower garden, an orchard, an aviary (which included an owl) and a symmetrical planned arrangement of trees known as the \"Grove\". To the side of the Grove was a patte d'oie, or 'Goosefoot', three avenues which terminated by buildings including the 'Bagnio' (or Casino, designed by Lord Burlington and Colen Campbell) in 1716, the 'Pagan Temple' (designed by the Catholic Baroque architect James Gibbs) and the Rustic House (designed by Lord Burlington).\nTerminating one end of the ha-ha stands a Deer House designed by Burlington. A second Deer House once stood at the opposite end of the ha-ha until replaced by Inigo Jones' gateway in 1738. Both Deer Houses had pyramidal roofs and characteristic 'Vitruvian' doors; a feature that comes directly from Palladio's woodcuts from his I quattro libri dell'architettura of 1570. Immediately behind the ha-ha and between the two Deer Houses was the Orangery, which, as its name suggests, originally housed Burlington's orange trees over the cold winter period (some of these trees were once positioned around the perimeter of the Ionic Temple). Part of the floor of this building was laid out in imitation of a Roman mosaic which English Heritage archaeologists in 2009 dated to the mid 18th century. Next to the remaining Deer Houses stands the Doric column on which was placed a statue of the Venus di' Medici.\n\n\n== Layout ==\n\nIn the eighteenth century statues of Venus were the most common statue in a garden as it was known that the goddess Venus was the protector of gardens and gardeners. The statue that can be seen on the Doric column today is a copy in Portland stone and was commissioned by the Chiswick House Friends in 2009. Other statues that Lord Burlington had made for the gardens included a wolf, a boar, a goat, a lion and lioness, a statue of the Roman god Mercury, a gladiator, Hercules, and Cain and Abel.\nThe lawn at the rear of the house was created by 1745 and planted with young Cedar of Lebanon trees which alternate with stone funerary urns designed by William Kent. Placed between the urns and the Cedar of Lebanon are three more sphinxes orientated to face the rising sun.\nA lake was created around 1727 by widening the Bollo Brook. The excess soil was then heaped up behind William Kent's cascade to produce an elevated walkway for people to admire the gardens and a view of the nearby River Thames. A gateway designed by Inigo Jones in 1621 at Beaufort House in Chelsea (home of Sir Hans Sloane) was bought and removed by Lord Burlington and rebuilt in the gardens at Chiswick in 1738.\n\nLord Burlington is sometimes said to have been influenced by largely informal Chinese gardens, but the flavour of the Orient was not evoked in Burlington's classically inspired gardens, which were universally Roman in outlook. Unlike Stowe, with its Temple of Worthies and busts such as the Black Prince, Queen Elizabeth I and Shakespeare, Burlington's gardens at Chiswick did not romance or mythologise England's illustrious past. This was possibly due to Burlington's intense dislike of the Gothic style which he regarded as barbaric and backward.\nLord Burlington's gardens at Chiswick were one of the most painted of English gardens in the 18th century. The Flemish painter Pieter Andreas Rijsbrack (brother of John Michael Rysbrack) was commissioned to paint a series of eight paintings to record the transformation of the garden from formal Jacobean to informal picturesque at the end of the 1750s. Together with copies of a second set these paintings today hang in the Green Velvet Room. Other artists who were commissioned to record the appearance of the gardens were England's first landscape painter George Lambert (1700–1765), the French painter Jacques Rigaud (1681–1754) and the cartographer John Rocque (1709–1762) who produced an engraved survey of Chiswick in 1736 showing the Villa and many of its garden buildings.\nThe walled gardens were originally part of a house owned by Sir Stephen Fox in the 17th century. In the early 19th century the house and gardens became part of the Chiswick House estate. Fox's house was demolished, though the gardens were kept.\n\n\n== Kitchen Garden ==\nThe kitchen garden was founded in 1682. Its ownership changed several times, and the garden fell into disrepair. In 2005 it was restored by local volunteers of the Chiswick House Kitchen Garden Community project. In 2009 the kitchen garden was taken over by Chiswick House and Gardens Trust; the National Lottery Heritage Fund provided a grant for restoration work and the conversion of the surrounding buildings.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Later developments ==\n\nThe Classic Bridge located beyond the Orange Tree Garden was built for Georgiana Spencer. It was constructed in 1774 to the designs of James Wyatt. Alterations were made to the gardens in 1778 by the fifth Duke of Devonshire and included the demolition of the Casina in 1778 and the pulling down of the Gibbs Pagan Temple by 1784. Richard Hewlings states that the reason for such actions was not neglect but rather: \"it was a change of taste, away from artificial temples located within a geometrically ordered plan\". In 1784 the Duke engaged Samuel Lapidge, a landscape designer who had previously worked under Lancelot 'Capability' Brown, to make further changes to the garden, including the filling in of the northern rectangular pond. The Sixth Duke of Devonshire (the 'Bachelor' Duke) obtained permission in 1813 to relocate Burlington Road beyond the two piers at the front of the forecourt to its present position.\nThe gardens of Little Moreton Hall, an adjoining property to the east, were added in 1812, the hall itself being demolished. In that same year the Italian Garden was laid out on the newly acquired grounds to a design by Lewis Kennedy. The conservatory adjoining the Italian Garden was completed in 1813, and at 96m was the longest at that time. A collection of camellias is housed in the conservatory, some of which have survived from 1828 to this day.\nThe garden designer Joseph Paxton, creator of the Crystal Palace, started his career in the gardens at Chiswick for the Royal Horticultural Society before his talents were recognised by William Cavendish, the sixth Duke of Devonshire and he relocated as head gardener to Chatsworth House, Derbyshire.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nHewlings, Richard (1989).

        "content": "Vlasta is a weekly women's magazine which has been in circulation since 1947. The magazine is headquartered in Prague, the Czech Republic. Its title is a reference to a female warrior from an Old Czech legend. It was the most popular publication of the Communist era in the country.\n\n\n== History and profile ==\nVlasta was established by Milada Horáková in 1947. Its establishment was supported by the Council of Czech Women which was a commission of experts. The cover of its first issue featured Edvard Beneš and his wife Hana Beneš. The magazine was started as a biweekly publication. It is published on a weekly basis.\nDuring the Communist period Vlasta was under the state control via the Czechoslovak Women's Union (CSWU). The CSWU was also its publisher. From the late 1960s it became relatively less dependent on the CSWU. During this period it covered articles on feminism, but this phase ended in 1969 when the magazine was subject to strict censorship. Vlasta reinforced the goals of the state in regard to the increase of the birth rate and diminishing the women's burden of formal labor and domestic work. In line with the former the magazine published anti-abortion articles in the 1950s and 1960s. It published the memos of the CSWU functioning as its spokesman.\nVlasta sold 630,000 copies in 1967. The magazine had the second highest circulation in 1968 after the Rudé právo newspaper. As a result, its page number was increased from 16 to 32 in February 1968. The magazine enjoyed higher levels of circulation until 1989. Then it began to be published by a private company.\nAs of 2006 Vlasta was described as a conservative women's magazine focusing on topics related to the roles of women's as a mother and a spouse.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Selago corymbosa is a species of plant in the family Scrophulariaceae. It is endemic to South Africa.\n\n\n== Description ==\nA perennial, woody, loosely-branching shrublet. One of a group of southern African Selago species (including Selago dolosa, Selago punctata, and Selago variicalyx) that have fascicled leaves, pubescent stems, and an inflorescence that is a corymbose panicle.\nSelago corymbosa is frequently confused with the related species Selago dolosa, but can be distinguished by the following characters: \n\nThe leaves of S. corymbosa are narrower (length:width ratio 10-24 : 1 rather than 2.5-7 : 1), longer (5-12mm rather than 2-7mm), and more glandular-hairy. The S. corymbosa leaves also have a raised midrib blow and margins that recurve when dry.\nThe bracts of S. corymbosa are also narrower (0.4-0.7mm rather than 0.7-1.25mm).\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nSelago corymbosa is mainly confined to the southern Cape regions of South Africa, where it favours grassy scrub vegetation mainly around the coastal lowlands, but also spreads in disturbed areas. \nIn the west it is common around the Cape Peninsula, Somerset West, Stellenbosch and Paarl, northwards to the area around Ceres. Its eastern populations occur approximately between Knysna and Humansdorp. \nIn the area between these two populations, i.e., between Somerset West in the west, and George/Knysna in the east, an intermediate form of Selago dolosa occurs, that shows some morphological influence of Selago corymbosa.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Stimpy's Big Day is the first episode of the first season of The Ren & Stimpy Show that  originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on 11 August 1991.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the first of a two-part story, Ren and Stimpy are living together in a trailer park. Ren berates Stimpy for spending too much time watching cartoons on television and in particular The Muddy Mudskipper Show. Stimpy enters a poetry contest for the Gritty Kitty Litter where he declares his love of kitty litter. Stimpy's inane poem wins the first prize. As a result, Stimpy wins $47 million and an appearance on  The Muddy Mudskipper Show. Stimpy leaves for Hollywood while Ren becomes lonely in his trailer park. The story concludes with the next episode The Big Shot!.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of John Kricfalusi\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nMuddy Mudskipper-voice of Harris Peet\nPool babe-voice of Cheryl Chase\nTV announcer-voice of Darrin Sargent\nTV Announcer-voice of Jim Smith\nPillow-voice of Vincent Waller.\n\n\n== Production ==\nProduction started in October 1990 in order to meet the schedule premiere in August 1991. Much of the episode was drawn by the couple John Kricfalusi and Lynne Naylor. The production was greatly hindered when Naylor broke up with Kricfalusi in March 1991, which marked the end of her involvement with The Ren & Stimpy Show. Working on Stimpy's Big Day imposed serious strains as their relationships as Naylor was far more committed to reaching the deadlines imposed by the studio than was Kricfalusi. David Koenigsberg of the Spümcø studio recalled: \"She was building up with all this tension because she felt the deadlines much more oppressively than John did.\" Koingsberg recalled that the other animators would laugh and joke while working, but Naylor \"was like the uptight librarian reminding everyone 'we have to go back to work now'. She was serious, it was not a joke. I remember talking to her one day about how we should laugh at this, and she really couldn't\". Naylor had completed the lay-outs for Stimpy's Big Day when she broke up with Kricfalusi. However, despite the break-up, Naylor played a major role in Stimpy's Big Day as she drew the opening scene where Ren criticizes Stimpy for watching cartoons too much, which established a dynamic that continued for the rest of the show. Both Kricfalusi and Naylor had born in the 1950s, and as result the couple set Stimpy's Big Day sometime in the 1950s as a tribute to the world of their youth.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe American journalist Thad Komorowski rated Stimpy's Big Day favorably, giving the episode three stars.\n\n\n== Books ==\nDobbs, G.

        "content": "Motswasele I (died c. 1785) was kgosi of the Kwena tribe from c. 1770 until his death c. 1790. He was preceded by his grandfather Motshodi and succeeded by his son Seitlhamo.\n\n\n== Life ==\nMotswasele was born in the early 18th century, between 1715 and 1745. He the son of Legojane and the grandson of Motshodi, kgosi of the Bakwena. Bakwena oral tradition tells that Motswasele was a prolific traveler when he was young and was the first of the Bakwena to see Europeans. Legojane died before Motshodi, making Motswasele the next in line to be kgosi. Motswasele took on responsibilities to manage the tribe as Motshodi grew older, and he became kgosi upon Motshodi's death c. 1770. He led the tribe to Shokwane and then to Dithejane. Here the Bakwena defeated the Bangwaketse in battle at Gookodisa.\nOne story tells that Mathiba was the younger brother of Motswasele, and that Motswasele sentenced Mathiba to death for castrating bulls without permission. It is said that when they encountered Lesele, they agreed that he could take Mathiba away. Mathiba's followers went with him, separating the Bangwato from the Bakwena. This story is contradicted by other accounts that Mathiba was the heir to the Bangwato who lived with the Bakwena until he came of age.\n\n\n== Death and succession ==\nMotswasele died c. 1785. By this time, the Bakwena had returned to Shokwane. He was succeeded by his son Seitlhamo. Motswasele had another son, Monametse, who did not become kgosi.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nMpotokwane, James (1974). \"A Short History of the Bahurutshe of King Motebele, Senior Son of King Mohurutshe\".

        "content": "Stephen Donald Wilton , also known as Steve Wilton, is an Australian molecular biologist and academic, serving as the Foundation Professor of Molecular Therapy at Murdoch University and adjunct professor at the University of Western Australia (UWA). He also fulfills dual roles as a Director at the Perron Institute for Neurological and Translational Science and deputy director at Murdoch's Centre for Molecular Medicine and Innovative Therapeutics (CMMIT).Wilton and his colleague Sue Fletcher were among the first to explore the application of antisense oligomers for treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Their research led to the development of three exon-skipping compounds that have received approval from the US FDA for restoring functional dystrophin expression in the most common mutations associated with DMD. His research in molecular therapy and translational medicine, emphasizing neuromuscular diseases like DMD, has earned him awards such as the Western Australian Innovator of the Year Award, the Australian Museum Eureka Award for Translational Medicine, and the LabGear Discovery Award. He was honored as an Officer of the Order of Australia for his contributions to medical research, neurological science, and muscular dystrophy.Wilton holds the title of Paul Harris Fellow at Rotary International and is an Honorary Life Member of Muscular Dystrophy Western Australia and the Australasian Gene and Cell Therapy Society.\n\n\n== Education ==\nWilton obtained his Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Adelaide (AU) in 1978, followed by a Bachelor of Science with Honours in 1979. He served as Chief Production Biochemist at Geneworks in Adelaide, from 1983 to 1987 after completing his Doctor of Philosophy degree, which was conferred in 1984 from AU.\n\n\n== Career ==\nWilton served as the Head of the DNA Sequencing Unit at the Australian Neuromuscular Research Institute from 1991 to 2004. He then directed the High Throughput Genotyping Facility at the Neurodegenerative Diseases Centre from 1999 to 2010 and occupied various roles at UWA until 2013, including Research Professor and Head of the Molecular Genetic Therapies Group. In 2013, he assumed the position of Director at the Perron Institute and concurrently took on an appointment as Foundation Chair in Molecular Therapy at the Centre for Comparative Genomics at Murdoch University. He was also involved in establishing Centre for Molecular Medicine and Innovative Therapeutics (CMMIT) as part of Murdoch's Health Futures initiative as a research joint venture with the Perron Institute in 2019. He served as the Director of CMMIT until early 2023 and holds the position of Deputy Director while serving on its Community Advisory Group and focusing on research on precision medicine and therapeutics for inherited and acquired disorders. Additionally, he holds positions as Foundation Chair and Co-Head of the Molecular Therapy Laboratory at Murdoch University, and is an adjunct professor at UWA. He continues to be the Director at the Perron Institute for Neurological and Translational Science, a position he has held since 2013.Wilton has worked with various organizations, including Neuromuscular WA, MSWA, Rotary Club (Australia and International), FSHD Global, SMA Australia, and multiple Duchenne-focused groups. He held the position of vice-president at the Australian Gene Therapy Society from 2007 to 2009 and served as President of the Australasian Gene and Cell Therapy Society (AGCTS), while also holding a seat on the executive board of the World Muscle Society from 2010 to 2012. In addition, he co-founded RAGE Biotech and has remained an Ex Officio Committee member at AGCTS since 2013.\n\n\n== Research ==\nWilton's research spans molecular medicine, antisense nucleic acids, RNA splicing, and precision medicine, with applications for conditions including neurodegenerative diseases, cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophies, multiple sclerosis, and respiratory conditions. His research group has also developed pre-clinical candidates for adult-onset Pompe's disease, inflammation, and motor neuron disease. In collaboration with Monash University researchers, his group has focused on anti-inflammatory oligomers targeting Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE) for conditions such as sepsis, asthma, and emphysema.Wilton's work has been featured in media outlets including The West Australian, Boston Business Journal, Business News, and ABC News.\n\n\n=== Molecular therapy and translational medicine ===\nWilton's group was the first to report specific exon skipping in an animal model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which led ultimately to the development of a complete panel of splice-switching oligonucleotides. Their work demonstrated the efficacy of phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) as splice-switching agents. Their efforts culminated in the development of three drugs: Eteplirsen (Exondys 51), targeting exon 51 and approved in 2016; Golodirsen (Vyondys 53), targeting exon 53 and approved in 2019; and Casimersen (Amondys 45), approved in 2021.Wilton has demonstrated the broad applicability of splice-switching antisense oligomers in addressing various diseases such as Marfan syndrome and juvenile-onset Parkinson's disease. His earlier research identified rare dystrophin-positive fibers, termed revertant fibers, as a potential genetic therapy for DMD, and proposed that inducing exon skipping in dystrophin pre-mRNA with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) could alleviate disease severity. Additionally, he documented the first successful excision of dystrophin exon 23 in vitro using steric-blocking antisense oligomers and demonstrated that weekly intravenous injections of morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) induce functional dystrophin expression in mdx mice, suggesting potential for DMD treatment.In 2006, Wilton developed antisense oligomers to induce exon skipping in the human dystrophin gene, showing varying efficiency across exons. His research in 2009 showed the safe increase of dystrophin expression with intramuscular AVI-4658 administration, advancing DMD clinical trials, while his 2011 work highlighted AVI-4658's well-tolerance, exon 51 skipping induction, and new dystrophin protein expression, indicating its potential as a disease-modifying drug for DMD. Collaborating with R.N. Veedu and Fletcher, he stressed the importance of evaluating reported dystrophin expression and addressing drug safety, efficacy, and study parameters to promote targeted dystrophin exon removal. Furthermore, he explored the potential of PMO in restoring functional expression of the SMN2 gene transcript in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2009 – Paul Harris Fellow, Rotary International\n2012 – Western Australian Innovator of the Year, Western Australian Department of Commerce\n2013 – NSW Health Jamie Callachor Eureka Prize for Medical Research Translation, Australia Museum\n2021 – Officer Order of Australia, Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet\n2022 – Industry Leadership Award, AusBiotech and Johnson & Johnson\n\n\n== Selected articles ==\nAlter, J., Lou, F., Rabinowitz, A., Yin, H., Rosenfeld, J., Wilton, S.

It maintains the Purdis Heath course.\nThe club was founded in 1895 with its original course on common land, part of Rushmere Common. However it was not until 1928 that the Purdis Heath course was opened. The course was designed by James Braid.\nThe course is 6,431 yards long with a par of 71.\nThe club hosted the Ladies' British Open Amateur Stroke Play Championship twice, in 1973 when Anne Stant won with Mary Everard as runner up and in 1987 when it was won by Linda Bayman with Jill Thornhill and Nicola Way as runners-up.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The National Independence Party (Russian: Партия национальной независимости, romanized: Partiya natsionalnoy nezavisimosti; abbreviated PNN) was a political party in the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria led by human rights activist and businessman Ruslan Kutayev. Initially opposed to the government of Dzhokhar Dudayev, the party later shifted in support of him following the beginning of the First Chechen War, and later achieved landslide victories during the 1997 Chechen presidential election.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe National Independence Party was founded on 27 May 1993, on the initiative of the Congress of Entrepreneurs of Chechnya. At the time of his election as the party's leader, Kutayev was head of the Kavkaz concern. Said-Magomed Satuyev was selected as the party's second leader in a 1993–1994 congress. The party's programme listed its main positions as support for Chechen traditions, streamlining of government, and a \"rational\" mixed economy. It criticised Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev, accusing him of corruption, and led an October 1993 assembly of teips and ethnic minorities demanding an end to government pressure on the press and calling for new parliamentary elections.\nIn response to the congress, Chechen authorities launched an effort to crack down on the party; the Prosecutor General's office ordered a raid on the party's headquarters, alleging corruption in its ranks. The party was supported by Chechen volunteers of the Confederation of Mountain Peoples of the Caucasus who had fought in the War in Abkhazia. The latter group demanded economic reforms, the removal of allegedly corrupt officials, and the appointment of petroleum executive Adam Albakov as Prime Minister of Ichkeria.\nFollowing the beginning of the First Chechen War, the party was initially disbanded before being re-established in the summer of 1995. Following its re-establishment, the party grew to be among the strongest supporters of Dudayev and Chechen independence, and alongside the pro-Dudayev Assembly Party and the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, formed a concordat to jointly support Chechnya and Chechen citizens for the duration of the war.\nThe PNN's support for Dudayev during the war led to a significant upswing in its support following the 1996 Khasavyurt Accord that brought the conflict to an end. The party's ticket in the 1997 Chechen presidential election was headed by incumbent Prime Minister Aslan Maskhadov and field commander Vakha Arsanov. The ticket was described by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty as being \"widely regarded as the most moderate\", and backed by both supporters of Chechen independence and its opponents. In the presidential election, it won an overwhelming victory with between 59.3% and 64.8% of the vote. The parliamentary election, held the same day, was equally bountiful for the PNN, with either 20 deputies (as claimed by political scientist Timur Muzayev) or 65% (as claimed by Kutayev) of all deputies elected being members of the party. The Speaker of the Chechen Parliament, Ruslan Alikhadzhiyev, was also a member of the party.\nFollowing the election, however, the coalition between Maskhadov and Arsanov began to collapse, owing to, among other things, Maskhadov's signing of the Russia–Chechnya Peace Treaty and perceived lack of authority on the one hand, and Arsanov's de facto control over the country and perceived erratic anti-Russian behaviours on the other hand. In opposition to both Maskhadov and Arsanov were several other field commanders who were supportive of sharia. By February 1999, the situation had reached a boiling point, as Islamist field commanders established their own government in opposition to that of Maskhadov and Arsanov.\nThe PNN was at its strongest in the Achkhoy-Martanovsky and Urus-Martanovsky districts, where it allegedly organised a paramilitary composed of the party's supporters. It was primarily supported by members of the minor teips who had made profits in Russia during the First Chechen War. During the Second Chechen War, its leadership, including Maskhadov, Arsanov, and Alikhadzhiyev were killed. Kutayev was later arrested by the government of Ramzan Kadyrov before being released in 2017.\n\n\n== Electoral results ==\n\n\n=== Parliamentary ===\n\n\n=== Presidential ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Astvatsankal Monastery is an Armenian Monastery complex in Aragatsotn Province, between the villages of Yernjatap and Hartavan. It was built in the 4th-13th centuries.\nThe original chapel of the church was built in the 5th or 6th century.The main church was added to the chapel in 1244 under the commission of Prince K'urd of the Vachutian dynasty and his wife Xorisali, as known from an inscription:\nBy the grace and mercy of God, I Kurd, Prince of Princes, son of the great Vache, and my wife Khorishah, daughter of Marzpan, built the Holy Katoghike for the memory of our souls. We have decorated it with every kind of precious ornament and offered the garden bought by us in Parpi, virgin land in Oshakan, a garden in Karbi, a villager (?), and three hostels, in the year 693/AD 1244.\nA large gavit or narthex was built right after, circa 1250.This is one of the famous examples of Armenian architecture in the 13th century adopting the use of muqarnas designs, spurred by the influence of contemporary Islamic architecture. Examples of this can be found in the Geghard Monastery, the Gandzasar Monastery as well (all in present-day Armenia), and at the Church of St Gregory of the Illuminator in Ani. In many of these examples, muqarnas vaults are recurring features in the gavits (narthexes) of the churches, which were the locus of much innovation and experimentation in medieval Armenian architecture. These borrowings of Islamic architectural motifs may have been due to either Ilkhanid or Seljuk influences in the region, although the wide geographic spread of muqarnas usage in this period makes it difficult to pinpoint any specific influence with certainty.The gavit collapsed in the 1988 Armenian earthquake, but has since been reconstructed.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Phylloneura rupestris is a species of damselfly endemic to the Western Ghats region of India.Its common name is cliffside bambootail.\n\n\n== Description ==\nMale Phylloneura rupestris can be distinguished from P. westermanni by extensive blue markings on the seventh abdominal segments, while females have a distinct apical blue ring on seventh abdominal segments. Male specimens also differ in thicker cerci and rounded tips of paraprocts. Range overlap is absent between the two species.\n\n\n== Range ==\nPhylloneura rupestris is currently only from the type locality (Ponmudi Hills, southern Western Ghats), but it could be present in similar habitats (seasonal streams flowing over rocky cliffs at mid-altitudes) in the Agasthyamalai Hills, as these form a continuous chain of forested hills in the southern Western Ghats.\n\n\n== Habitat and ecology ==\nIn the type locality, a population of 30 individuals of Phylloneura rupestris was seen perched on vegetation around a steep rocky cliff over which rills of a seasonal stream flowed. The sky was overcast and there was light drizzle. Most of the observed individuals were males, and females were seen only while mating. They occasionally made short, slow flights, probably chasing flying insect prey, before returning to their perches.\n\n\n== Reproduction ==\nIn observed instances of reproductive behavior, oviposition was witnessed in six pairs of Phylloneura rupestris. The sequence of events unfolded as follows: the male descended slowly from its perch, dipped its abdomen in the water, then returned to catch a female in tandem. Intra-male sperm translocation followed, then the pair flew around before descending for oviposition. The female laid eggs on submerged moss mats twice, with the male in tandem. Following these oviposition events, the pair perched on streamside vegetation before separating. The entire reproductive activity spanned approximately 15.51 minutes.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe species epithet \"rupestris\" is derived from Latin and signifies \"that lives on cliffs or rocks\", in reference to the habitat predilection of Phylloneura rupestris.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jerry The Bellybutton Elf is the 12th episode of the third season of The Ren & Stimpy Show that  originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on April 9 1994.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nStimpy is spending too much time playing with bellybutton, and hears a voice from inside his bellybutton, telling him to go inside his bellybutton where he will have \"fun\". Stimpy embarks on a psychedelic journey into his bellybutton to the tune of Climb Inside My World where he meets Jerry the bellybutton elf who enslaves him.. Ren finds a nub, which is all that is left of Stimpy.. Without Stimpy around, Ren throws a party which is attended by all of the recurring characters including Muddy Mudskipper and his obese wife, Mimby. When Stimpy brings Jerry a meal made of lint, he becomes angry. Jerry turns into a monster, Adonis the Lord of Chaos, who tries to eat Stimpy. Stimpy tries to escape, but only drags Ren inside of his bellybutton. Jerry eats both Ren and Stimpy while Mimby eats what remains of Stimpy.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of Billy West\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nJerry the Bellybutton Elf-voice of Gilbert Gottfried\nThe Salesman-voice of Billy West\nMuddy Mudskipper-voice of Harris Peet.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe task of directing Jerry the Bellybutton Elf was assigned to Ron Hughart who was known as \"the reliable director\". The story was intended as a parody of Alice in Wonderland. Hughart said of his work on Jerry: \"The [Climb Inside My World] was added to the episode at some point after the initial storyboard was given to me. A couple of the guys didn't want to board the sequence or at least didn't know what to do with it. I boarded it and timed it\".. \n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe American journalist Thad Komorowski rated Jerry as a bomb as wrote the episode was a \"pitifully unfunny cartoon\".. By contrast, the critic Witney Seibold praised the climax and Gottfried's voice acting, writing: \"Jerry has one of the most vocal and unusual freakouts in a show full of them. Gottfried didn't just employ his well-known voice, but pushed it to 11, shrieking at the top of his lungs and mutating into a giant murderous porkchop. What a class act.\"\n\n\n== Books ==\nDobbs, G.

He received the Professional Achievement Award in the 41st Hong Kong Film Awards for his contributions in the film industry.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nIn the 1960s, Sek began submitting film reviews to The Chinese Student Weekly at the age of seventeen. Although his articles were initially rejected, he received a reply letter from the chief editor, Law Kar, who encouraged him to continue writing film reviews.

        "content": "The 2024 Japan Football League (Japanese: 第26回日本フットボールリーグ[第26回 JFL 2024], Hepburn: Dai Nijūrokkai Nihon Futtobōru Rīgu [Dai Nijūrokkai JFL 2024]) is the eleventh season having a fourth-tier status in Japanese football and the 26th season since the establishment of the Japan Football League.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\n\n=== Promoted from the JFL to the J3 League ===\nNo team was promoted from the JFL to the J3, since none of the top four clubs last season met the needed requirements for promotion, which includes (but not limited to) having a J3 license.\n\n\n=== Promoted from the Regional Leagues ===\nTochigi City, 2023 Kanto Soccer League runner-up, was the sole promoted team to the JFL as they won the 2023 Regional Champions League.Vonds Ichihara could join Briobecca Urayasu as Chiba's representatives in the JFL, had they won the 2023 JFL play-off against Okinawa SV.\n\n\n=== Promotion and relegation between J3 and JFL ===\nThis season is the second to feature promotion/relegation between the J3 League and the Japan Football League, enabling the possibility for teams to be relegated from the J3. The system of promotion/relegation between the leagues can be determined by the eligibility (Promotion to J3 requires a J.League license) of the JFL's champions and runners-up for the season.\nNo changes were made from the previous season:\n\nIf only the JFL champion holds a license, there will be automatic promotion/relegation with the J3's 20th-placed team.\nIf only the JFL runner-up holds a license, there will be promotion/relegation play-offs with the J3's 20th-placed team.\nIf both the JFL champion and runner-up hold a license, there will be automatic promotion/relegation between the JFL champions and the J3's 20th-placed team, and promotion/relegation play-offs with the J3's 19th-placed team.\nIf neither the JFL champion nor the runner-up holds a license, no promotion/relegation between J3 and JFL will take place.\nIn addition, the J.League stated extra requisites for promotions, with teams needing to have an average attendance of at least 2,000 in home matches, and an annual admission revenue of at least 10 million yen.The dates and the host teams of the promotion/relegation play-off were pre-determined by the J.League. In case it happens: It will be played in two legs on 1 and 7 December, with the J3 team hosting the second leg; away-goals rule will not be applied; should the match be tied, it will require extra-time, and if the draw persists, penalty shoot-outs.\n\n\n=== Promotion and relegation between JFL and Regional Leagues ===\nThe winner of the 2024 Regional Champions League (JFL promotion series) will be automatically promoted for the 2024 JFL.\nThe 15th-placed team from the JFL will play a play-off match against the runners-up of the promotion series, with the winner earning a spot at the 2025 JFL. It will be held on 30 November or 1 December, at a stadium picked by the host team from the JFL.\nThe 16th-placed team will be automatically relegated to their respective Regional League.\n\n\n=== Club name changes ===\nTokyo Musashino United FC returned to its former name Yokogawa Musashino FC, and Suzuka Point Getters became Atletico Suzuka Club.\n\n\n== Participating clubs ==\nThe teams which possess promotion-enabler licenses are highlighted in green in the following table.\n\n\n=== Personnel and kits ===\n\n\n=== Managerial changes ===\nNo mid-season change was made so far.\n\n\n== Foreign players ==\n\n\n== League table ==\n\n\n== JFL/Regional Leagues promotion/relegation playoff ==\n\n\n== Top scorers ==\nAs of 14 April 2024.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational associationJapan Football Association (JFA)LeagueJapanese association football league system\nJ.League\n2024 J1 League\n2024 J2 League\n2024 J3 LeagueCup2024 FUJIFILM Super Cup (Super Cup)\n2024 Emperor's Cup (national open cup)\n2024 J.League YBC Levain Cup (League Cup)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in Japanese)",

        "content": "Iwamoto Chizuna (Japanese: 岩本 千綱, 1858–1920) was a Japanese soldier and adventurer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nIwamoto Chizuna was born into a samurai family in 1858.\nIn 1879, Iwamoto graduated from the Imperial Japanese Army Academy and eventually achieved the rank of first lieutenant (中尉, chūi). In 1887, he was discharged from the Army on account of his association with members of the Freedom and People's Rights Movement including Inukai Tsuyoshi.\nIn 1892, he moved to Siam and devoted himself to encouraging economic and cultural ties between Japan and Siam. He also visited Luang Phrabang.\nIwamoto and Ishibashi Usaburō founded the Siam Colonization Society (暹羅植民協会, Shamu Shokumin Kyōkai) with financial support from Chaophraya Surasakmontri. The society was later reorganized as the Siam Colonization Company (暹羅植民会社, Shamu Shokumin Kaisha). According to Ishibashi, the long-term goals of the company included, among other things, \"establish[ing] a latent Japanese influence [in Siam]\" and \"install[ing] Japanese in the Siamese government\".\nBefore Iwamoto returned home to recruit Japanese peasants for the colonization project, Surasakmontri gave him a golden sword to be sharpened in Japan. The Siam Colonization Company ended in disaster with many of the Japanese immigrants winding up dead or enslaved as coolies.\nIn 1897, Iwamoto published a book about his travels — A True Account of an Expedition to the Three Countries of Siam, Laos, and Annam (暹羅老檛安南三国探検実記, Shamu-Raosu-An'nan Sangoku Tanken Jikki). He died in 1920.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n岩本 Iwamoto, 千綱 Chizuna. \"岩本千綱氏暹羅国旅行目的報告書 Mr. Iwamoto Chizuna's Report on the Purpose of his Travels to Siam\" (PDF). 早稲田大学図書館 Waseda University Library.

        "content": "The Watch Tower (1966) is a novel by Australian author Elizabeth Harrower.\n\n\n== Plot outline ==\nLaura and Clare Vaizey are sisters living in Sydney in the period around World War II. When their father dies and their class-conscious mother decides to return to live in England the sisters are left to fend for themselves. Laura abandons her medical studies, goes to work in a factory and accepts a marriage proposal from Felix Shaw on the understanding that he will also look after her sister.  But Felix is an attention-hungry tyrant with a lack of empathy who sets out to belittle, gaslight and demean the two sisters at every opportunity.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nReviewing the novel in The Washington Post on its reissue in 2012 Michael Dirda was unequivocal: \"This is a harrowing novel, relentless in its depiction of marital enslavement, spiritual self-destruction and the exploited condition of women in a masculinist society. It reminded me of Zola in its unflinching depiction of two sisters entangled with a moody, violent man, one of them being gradually crushed into subservience, the other struggling desperately to save her own soul. It is a brilliant achievement.\" Praised by Patrick White in his letters edited by David Marr.\n\n\n== See also ==\n1966 in Australian literature\n\n\n== Notes ==\nText Publishing re-issued the novel in 2012 as part of their Text Classics series.\nAfter the novel was re-issued the author was interviewed by Ramona Koval for The Monthly.\n\n\n== References ==",

While Hackett was an undergraduate student in September 1968, she went to artist Andy Warhol's Factory at 33 Union Square West to see if he needed a typist. Warhol was impressed that she could type and brought her on as a part-time volunteer to transcribe his tapes. Art critic Blake Gopnik noted in the biography Warhol (2020) that \"over the next two decades she moved up to being his trusted confidante, collaborator and, especially, ghostwriter. Many famous Warholisms may in fact be Hackettian.\"\nHackett became close friends with Warhol's longtime partner Jed Johnson during her time at The Factory. Between studying and spending time at The Factory, she didn't have time for a job. By the spring of 1969, Hackett's finances were running low so she intended to quit volunteering at The Factory in order to find a part-time job, but Johnson notified Warhol and helped get her on the payroll which allowed her to continue working with Warhol.\nAfter the Internal Revenue Service started auditing Warhol in 1972, he started dictating a daily diary to Hackett, who was his secretary, to keep better account of his deductible expenses. At first he would do this when he came into work every day, and later over the phone. This eventually grew into The Andy Warhol Diaries (1989), which spanned from 1976 to 1987.\nIn 1973, Hackett assisted director Paul Morrissey with the scripts for Flesh for Frankenstein (1973) and Blood for Dracula (1974), but she was not credited.\nHackett's interviews with Warhol are the basis for the book The Philosophy of Andy Warhol (From A to B & Back Again) (1975). After Warhol's death in 1987, Hackett co-authored Andy Warhol's Party Book. In 1989, The Andy Warhol Diaries was published, a transcribed, edited and condensed version of a diary dictated by Warhol to Hackett in daily phone conversations.\nHackett appeared as a commentator in the documentary film Beautiful Darling: The Life and Times of Candy Darling, Andy Warhol Superstar (2010). In 2022, she appeared in the Netflix docuseries The Andy Warhol Diaries.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPat Hackett at IMDb",

        "content": "The Longjing Manse Movement (Korean: 용정 만세운동; Hanja: 龍井萬歲運動) occurred on March 13, 1919 in what is now Longjing, Jilin, Republic of China. During this event, unarmed Korean peaceful protestors were fired on by Chinese soldiers under warlord Zhang Zuolin, which caused 17 or 19 deaths and around 30 injuries. This incident was one among various March 1st Movement protests by the Korean diaspora.\nEstimates from eyewitnesses place the number of protestors to be around 20,000 to 30,000. This would represent around 10% of the total population of Jiandao (\"Gando\" in Korean) at the time. The protest was the first of its kind for Koreans in Jiandao, and is remembered for its role in bolstering the independence movement and inspiring similar subsequent protests there.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nIn 1910, Japan annexed Korea. On March 1, 1919, a nationwide protest against Japanese rule was held in Korea, in what has been dubbed the March 1st Movement. The protests were violently suppressed by Japan. Protests were also held by the Korean diaspora, such as those in Ussuriysk and in Shinhanchon, Vladivostok.\nThe Korean community in the north Jiandao region learned of the protests on March 7. The organization Korean Liberation Celebration Society (조선독립축하회; 朝鮮獨立祝賀會) was founded, and organized a protest. Local schools played a significant role in the organization. On March 13, the protest was held. Some people reportedly traveled from dozens of li away to join the protest, with some leaving the day before for the journey. Estimates vary on how many people were present, but it is estimated that 20,000 to 30,000 Koreans were present. The total population of Jiandao was around 250,000 to 300,000.: 1:34  At noon, the protest formally began with a reading of the Korean Declaration of Independence. A contemporary person wrote of this in their diary:\n\nThis is the day that the Korean people of [Jiandao] gather in Longjing and shout for independence. Around 10 people from my village were there. I couldn't go because my father was in mourning, so I sent my son along with a taegeukgi. This day, this day, this day [sic], could this be the day of our liberation? How is it that every person is glowing? [After the protest] in the evening, I heard that a large crowd of people gathered from all over to hear the news. After the noon bell finished ringing, a large flag celebrating Korea's independence was unfurled. Everyone raised their own flags and shouted \"long live Korean independence\". The flag blocked the sun, and the shouting echoed like thunder. When the Japanese authorities saw this, their faces turned ashen.\nAfter the ceremony, the crowd began marching and distributing flyers and waving Korean flags. The protest walked to the Japanese consulate building in Longjing.\nThe Japanese consulate pressured Chinese warlord Zhang Zuolin to send soldiers to suppress the protest. Soldiers were deployed under the command of Meng Fude (Chinese: 孟富德), who ended up giving the command to open fire on the protestors. After the volley of shots, 13 protestors were immediately killed, and over 30 were injuried. They were rushed over to a local hospital, and but four died there. By the end of the day, 17 or 19 total were dead.\nOn the 17th, a funeral was held for the dead, whom were hailed as martyrs, on a hill 10 li south of Longjing. Reportedly around 5,000 people were in attendance. From the 13th until the beginning of April, 47 protests were held in north Jiandao, with tens of thousands in attendance total. By mid-May, the number reached 54.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nReportedly, the Japanese consulate would later send people to monitor who would visit the graves, which caused fear of backlash and slowed visits to them. Knowledge of the location of the grave significantly dwindled over time. In 1989, the location was rediscovered and documented based on interviews of contemporaries. It was determined to be a part of a collective graveyard on a hill 10 li southeast of Longjing. In April 1990, an organization was launched to maintain the restoration and memorialization of the graves. Since 1991, a memorial ceremony for the dead has been held each year on March 13th. In the 2000s, a larger plot of land was purchased elsewhere for the graves, which were relocated. A hundred trees were planted around them. The graves have nearby space to host an audience of 200.\nThe place the protest was first planned is now part of a kindergarten. A stone memorial now stands there.: 1:09 \n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n김, 춘선 (2016). 북간도 한인사회의 형성과 민족운동. 고려대학교 민족문화연구원.

        "content": "Wang Chih-hsiung (Chinese: 王志雄; born 24 June 1952) is a Taiwanese banker and politician. Wang is a member of the Kuomintang who served on the Legislative Yuan from 1990 to 1993 and 1996 to 1999, and the Kaohsiung City Council between 1999 and 2002.\n\n\n== Personal life and political career ==\nWang Chih-hsiung's father Wang Yu-yun and younger brother Wang Shih-hsiung were also Kuomintang-affiliated politicians. The Wang brothers were elected to the Legislative Yuan together in 1989, with Wang Chih-hsiung representing Kaohsiung City's second district, and Wang Shih-hsiung representing the occupational constituency of fishing and aquaculture. Wang Chih-hsiung was elected to a non-consecutive term in the Legislative Yuan in 1995 for Kaohsiung City's first district. Wang Chih-hsiung subsequently ran in the December 1998 Taiwanese local elections, and was elected to the Kaohsiung City Council, serving from 1999 to 2002.\n\n\n== Banking career and legal judgements ==\nWang Chih-hsiung was vice chairman and member of the board for the Chung Shing Bank led by his father. Wang Chih-hsiung continued serving in financial leadership positions throughout his tenure as a city councilor. In 2004, Wang Chih-hsiung was subpoenaed repeatedly as part of legal proceedings and investigations into a credit loan case, but did not report to court. The case continued to trial in 2005, and Wang was placed on a wanted list. Wang fled Taiwan in 2007, and was arrested in China in 2012. The Taiwanese Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau repatriated him in October 2012. Wang was formally indicted by Taipei-based prosecutors in December 2012. The Taipei District Court ruled that Wang Chih-hsiung was not guilty in September 2013.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Anti-Erdoğanism is a political movement in opposition to Erdoğanism, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and Erdoğanists. Anti-Erdoğanism has a presence in every Turkish political faction, ranging from the far-left to the far-right, as well as from liberals, communists, and socialists, to conservatives, nationalists, and Islamists.\n\n\n== History ==\nSome Anti-Erdoganists accused Erdoğan and his AKP of being Neo-Ottomanists.\nDespite many criticising Erdoğan due to the perception of him being an Islamist, most Islamists criticise Erdoğan and his rule, as well as Erdoğanists due to them being an extreme cult of personality. The Felicity Party is among the fiercest Anti-Erdoganist parties in Turkey, which claims that Erdoğan is only an opportunist who uses religious rhetoric to maintain popular support.\nErdoğanism had been likened to Putinism.\nCritics of Erdoğanism accuse it of being a fascist ideology, especially after 2015. The accusations of fascism increased throughout the years. \nAlthough Erdoğan had initially helped the Kurds in Turkey, he began to lose more and more Kurdish support starting in 2015 because of his alliance with the MHP. Erdoğan often baselessly accuses Kurds who criticise his policies of being PKK supporters, which further disillusions the ones who do not support the PKK. Even conservative Kurds, of whom many were once staunch Erdoğan supporters, had ceased their support due to his increasing nationalism. During the 2023 elections, when Erdoğan pushed a very strong nationalist rhetoric, the majority of Kurds did not vote for him, and many conservative Kurds were repulsed by his nationalism to the point they viewed the opposition as a better alternative. Many Kurds denied that Erdoğan was an Islamist, and claimed that he was a mere \"Green Kemalist\".\nAbdullah Gül and Ahmet Davutoğlu became Anti-Erdoğanists due to the increasing nationalism of Erdoğan.\nThe National Path Party was founded in 2021 by BBP politicians and Alperen Hearths who were repulsed by Erdoğan. The party has no major ideological difference with the BBP except for the dispute about Erdoğan. Remzi Çayır had also claimed that Muhsin Yazıcıoğlu and Alparslan Türkeş would have been very disappointed seeing Idealists who support Erdoğan.\nThe Islamic State rebuffs Erdoğan as a \"taghut\", and his supporters as \"kuffar\". In the 4th edition of Rumiyah, the Islamic State called on people to \"ask Allah for help and attack Turkey\" and to \"stab those who support the AKP\".\nAlparslan Kuytul, a Salafi cleric, is a staunch critic of Erdoğan. Kuytul advocated for a Sharia system and also believed that Erdoğan is a taghut. Kuytul refers to the AKP as ZKP (Oppressive Development Party).\n\n\n== References ==",

The complex was opened in January 1982. The complex was built on the tomb of the Azerbaijani poet near the Jidir Plain in Shusha. About 80 exhibits reflecting the life of Vagif in Shusha were also exhibited here. National leader Heydar Aliyev, well-known literary and cultural figures attended the opening of the complex. As a result of the occupation of Shusha by the Armenian Armed Forces in May 1992, the building of the complex and dozens of exhibits on display were destroyed, and possible exhibits were transported to Armenia. \nAfter the liberation of Shusha by the Azerbaijani army on November 8, 2020, Vagif's museum-mausoleum complex was completely restored. On August 30, 2021, Vagif Poetry Days were reorganized by the Heydar Aliyev Foundation in the poet's hometown. \nOn August 30, official opening of the Vagif's Poetry Days took place. Exhibitions “Karabakh is a pearl of the Azerbaijani culture”, “Again in the native land. Karabakh’s pearls of art” and “Memory. Photographic History” took place within the Vagif's Poetry Days held in Shusha, August 30. \nExamples of painting and sculpture being showcased at the exhibition “Karabakh is a pearl of the Azerbaijani culture”, arranged at the Shusha Art Gallery, takes visitors to joyful and grievous, real and fantastic, open and hidden, colourful and monochrome world. The main origin of inspiration in the artworks being exhibited here is Karabakh. \nIn 1992, Armenian usurpers destroyed our national-spiritual, religious and historical-architectural monuments in Shusha, as well as the mausoleum of Molla Panah Vagif.\n Shusha had to wait for many years under military and political slavery to return to his busy days. But despite being under the occupation of Armenia for nearly 30 years, it did not lose its national identity and Azerbaijani spirit. Attempts by Armenians to change the cultural and political aura of Shusha, to present it as an Armenian city, did not yield any results. Shusha was able to retain its grandeur, magnificence, historical image. After liberation from the occupation, the Master Plan of Shusha was prepared shortly, the bust of the mighty poet Molla Panah Vagif and the museum-tomb complex were restored to their original appearance, the house-museum of Bulbul and the statue of Uzeyir Hajibeyov were inaugurated. As well as our territorial integrity, national pride, national dignity and spirituality, the \"Kharibulbul\" festival was also reorganized. The cultural capital of Azerbaijan again welcomed its natives and guests. On May 12, 2021, \"Karabakh\" shikeshte was heard in his native Shusha, as it was many years ago. With that, years later, the \"Kharibulbul\" festival was started. On August 29, 2021, Vagif Poetry Days were restored.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nKhari Bulbul Music Festival\nUzeyir Hajibeyov International Music Festival\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPresident and First Lady attended opening of Vagif Poetry Days in Shusha\nPoetry Days\nVagif Poetry Days end in Azerbaijan's liberated Shusha\nFirst Vice-President Mehriban Aliyeva shared posts on Vagif Poetry Days",

        "content": "Royal Academy of Medicine of Belgium (French: Académie royale de médecine de Belgique), founded on September 19, 1841, by royal decree of King Leopold I, is an academy that brings together Belgian scientists. It is headquartered in Brussels at the Palace of Academies.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Royal Academy of Medicine is a public institution founded on September 19, 1841, by royal decree of King Leopold I, upon the proposal of Jean-Baptiste Nothomb. Among the founders were Victor-Joseph François, a professor at the Faculty of Medicine of the Catholic University of Louvain, and Louis Seutin (1793–1862), a professor at the Faculty of Medicine of the Free University of Brussels. The academy depended on the Ministry of the Interior, which was under the charge of J.B Nothomb. The academy became an advisory body to the Ministry of Health upon its creation in 1936. In the years 1989–1990, it was administratively attached to the services of the Government of the French Community of Belgium. The statutes of the institution depend on a decree of the Government of the French Community dated December 19, 2013, and it was placed under the protection of the King.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nThe usual activities of the Royal Academy of Medicine include:\n\nthe organization of monthly plenary meetings, award ceremonies for the winners of academic prizes, symposia and other working sessions;\nthe work of numerous advisory committees;\nthe new statutes and organic regulations of 2008 introduced a number of important reforms, including the election of its members. It now chooses its members by election, following a selection procedure organized and coordinated by a twelve-member Selection Committee comprising the Board and the chairmen of the six sections;\nit publishes the Bulletin et Mémoires de l'Académie royale de Médecine de Belgique (Bulletin and Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Medicine of Belgium), containing mainly proceedings and minutes of meetings, as well as dissertations awarded prizes in various competitions;\neminent personalities from the world of medical science, chosen by the Board of Directors, frequently take to the podium to present their work at public meetings. Young researchers and outside personalities are also welcome to present their work;\nthe Académie contributes to the progress of the various branches of medicine, notably by awarding prizes to researchers whose work has been distinguished;\nthe academy awards prizes to future clinician-researchers and supports applied scientific research, in collaboration with the National Fund for Scientific Research (FNRS).\n\n\n== Operation ==\n\nThe Royal Academy of Medicine is under the authority of a \"Bureau\" consisting of a President, a Perpetual Secretary (who administers the academy), two vice-presidents, and two assessors. Two representatives of ordinary members also sit on the Bureau with advisory votes. The President and the two vice-presidents are elected, for one year, from among and by the full members. The perpetual secretary is appointed by the government of the French Community, on the proposal of the full members, for a term of five years. The Perpetual Secretary has the right to serve a second five-year term. If the perpetual secretary reaches the age of 75, his term ends on his birthday.\nThe academy is divided into six sections covering various fields of medicine (human and animal). It has six categories of members for which various age limits have been set:\n\nFull members (40)\nOrdinary members (60)\nHonorary members\nHonorary members (honoris causa)\nForeign members (90)\nHonorary foreign members.\n\n\n== Notable members ==\nJacques Brotchi – professor of neurosurgery\nMiriam Cnop – researcher and physician specializing in diabetology\nChristian de Duve – Nobel Prize-winning Belgian cytologist and biochemist\nMichel A. J. Georges – biologist and professor at the University of Liège\nJoseph Guislain –  physician and a psychiatrist\nBenoît Lengelé –  physician, surgeon, and anatomist\nFrançoise Meunier – medical doctor and former director general of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)\nMarc Parmentier – scientist and researcher of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), and of transgenic models of human pathologies\nEtienne Pays – molecular biologist and professor at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles\nMartine Piccart –  medical oncologist\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "2017 was the tenth competitive season for the Cairns based Sea Swift Northern Pride Rugby League Football Club. They were one of 14 clubs that played in the twenty-first season of Queensland's top rugby league competition, QRL's Intrust Super Cup, with each team playing 11 home games and 12 away games over 25 weeks between March and August.\nThe sacked CEO Rod Jensen was replaced by Greg Dowling. Dowling had a long playing career, having being a Kangaroo (1984–1987), played for the Maroons in Origin (1984–1987), Wynnum Manly (1981–1985) in the Brisbane Rugby League, Northern Suburbs (1987) in the Winfield State League, the Broncos (1988–1991) in the Winfield Cup, and Wigan Warriors in England RL's Championship and Challenge Cup.  \nInterim chairman, Terry Mackenroth stood down and was replaced by board member and Cairns real estate agent Tony Williamson.\nFeedback from fans convinced the club to return home games to Saturday evenings, as last year's move to 3:00pm on Sunday afternoons was not popular and crowd numbers fell. Home games this year were on Saturday evenings at 5:30pm, except for Round 17, 'Rivalry Round' against Mackay Cutters which was held at 1:40pm on Sunday afternoon and shown live on Channel 9.\nCoach Joe O'Callaghan (2015-2016) resigned at the end of last season, and was replaced by Ty Williams, who had played for the Cairns Cyclones in QCup (1999), played for the NRL's North Queensland Cowboys (2002–2010), represented Queensland in State of Origin (2005), and played for the Indigenous All Stars (2008 and 2010). Williams had played 78 games for the Pride (2009-2013), 52 of them as captain (2011-2013). After leaving the Pride, he was captain-coach of CDRL Innisfail Leprechauns, and more recently had been the Lep's coach.\nThe Pride struggled this year, winning only six games, and losing seventeen, including eight losses in a row from Round 11 to Round 19. The Pride, who previously had an unenviable record of wins at home, managed only two victories at Barlow Park. They finished in twelfth place, their worst season to date.\n\n\n== 2017 Season -  Sea Swift Northern Pride ==\n\nCompetition: Intrust Super Cup\nSponsor: Sea Swift\n\n\n=== Staff ===\n\n\n==== Coaches/Trainers ====\nCoach: Ty Williams\nAssistant coach: Sam Obst\nAssistant coach: Shane O'Flanagan\nMal Meninga Cup U-18s coaches: Dave Scott\nCyril Connell Cup U-16s coach:\nStrength and conditioning coach: Jonnie Walker\n\n\n==== Captain ====\nRyan Ghietti\nJared Allen (Vice-captain)\n\n\n=== Managers ===\nAdministration Manager: Kerri Neil then Lauren Dowling\nMarketing Officer: Rachael Tierney\nTeam manager: Alan Marsh\nAssistant manager (Home): Kev Anderson\nAssistant manager (Away): Murray Stalley\nChief executive: Greg Dowling\nChairman: Tony Williamson\nBoard of Directors: Colin Moore (CDRL), Ian Lydiard (CDJRL), Troy McGuane, (Cairns Post), Gail Andrejic (finance), Stephen Tillett, Rob White (football), Eleanor Scott (government).

        "content": "The Lake Success Shopping Center (also known as the Lake Success Mall) is a major shopping center in North New Hyde Park in the Town of North Hempstead, in Nassau County, New York, United States. It is located on Union Turnpike, just east of Nassau County's border with the New York City borough of Queens. It is managed by Lake Success Shopping Center LLC.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe 20-acre (8.1 ha) Lake Success Shopping Center was planned in the early 1950s. Designed by architect A.H. Salkowitz in 1953, the center opened in 1956. It was built and owned by Milton Peck and Arthur Shactman.Upon opening, the shopping center's major anchor tenants included Namm-Loeser – its largest – and J.C. Penney. Other major, early tenants at the Lake Success Shopping Center included Walgreens, Lanes, S.S. Kresge, and Thom McAn.On May 25, 1990, Sears opened a new location at the Lake Success Shopping Center, in the former Namm-Loeser space. It was one of two opened that day – the other being in Holbrook, New York – and was the first time Sears opened a new store on Long Island in 7 years.In the fall of 2015, a Macy's Backstage store opened at the shopping center. It was one of the first Backstage-branded stores the company opened. Also taking place in 2015 was the opening of the shopping center's Shake Shack location, located in the space formerly occupied by Deli King – a Kosher delicatessen – and was the burger chain's second location to open on Long Island.In 2018, the Sears at the shopping center closed – a result of the company's bankruptcy and subsequent restructuring; the company deemed the location as being unprofitable. It was soon thereafter announced that Target would open a store in the three-story space formerly occupied by the center's Sears. After several delays, it was announced in February 2024 that the Target store will open at some point within the year – and it will also contain a CVS Pharmacy and a Starbucks.In 2021, the center's Bed Bath & Beyond closed, resulting from its parent company's bankruptcy. Its Modell's also closed around this time, leaving Macy's Backstage, Barnes & Noble and Victoria's Secret/Pink as the largest anchors.In 2023, it was announced that Burlington Coat Factory, Claire's, Foot Locker, and The Paper Store would all become additional anchor tenants – in addition to a healthcare facility operated by Northwell Health.In early 2024 it was announced that the center's Target would open that April – and it will also contain a CVS Pharmacy and a Starbucks. It was also announced that, while the Target was originally to occupy the lower two floors of the former Sears, it will instead occupy all three.\n\n\n== Anchor tenants ==\nAs of 2024, the Lake Success Shopping Center's current anchor tenants include Barnes & Noble, Burlington Coat Factory, Foot Locker, Macy's Backstage, Sephora, The Paper Store, Target, and Victoria's Secret/Pink – as well as a branch of the USPS New Hyde Park, NY 11040 Post Office.Previous anchor tenants include Bed Bath & Beyond, Express, Loehmann's, Modell's Sporting Goods, Pier 1 Imports, and Sears.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nNassau Inter-County Express (NICE) bus service is available at the Lake Success Shopping Center, with the n25 bus route (Lynbrook LIRR – Great Neck LIRR) making multiple stops in front of the shopping center's western and eastern entrances, along Union Turnpike.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAmericana Manhasset – Another large, outdoor shopping mall in the Town of North Hempstead.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Lake Success Shopping Center at Wikimedia Commons",

Its purpose is to reduce the cost of the manufacturing process through a one-time molding, greatly reduces the parts required for car assembly and improve efficiency.\nThis new process has many different advantages and there are also many areas that need to be improved. It was first proposed and used as a solution by Elon musk in the manufacture of Tesla, the famous Giga Press program.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ijichi Ryū'emon Masaharu (Japanese: 伊地知 龍右衛門 正治, August 7, 1828 – May 23, 1886) was a Japanese samurai retainer of the Shimazu clan, military strategist, and aristocrat. His imina was Sueyasu (季靖).\n\n\n== Biography ==\nIjichi Masaharu was born near the walls of Kagoshima Castle. He was the second son, and his father was Ijichi Suehira (伊地知 季平). As a boy, he was given the apotropaic name Tatsugoma (竜駒). His family was a branch of the Ijichi clan, an old family allegedly descended from the ancient Taira.\nAt the age of 3, Ijichi was regarded as a child prodigy, but a childhood disease blinded his left eye and crippled his left leg. He suffered from the lameness caused by his disabled leg for the rest of his life.\nIjichi studied Yakumaru Jigen-ryū under the instruction of Yakumaru Kaneyoshi. He also studied the Satsuma Domain's traditional Gōden school (合伝流, Gōden-ryū) of military strategy under Ishizawa Rokurō (石沢六郎) and later Hōga Uzaemon (法亢宇左衛門).\n\n\n== Boshin War service ==\nDuring the Boshin War of 1868, Ijichi was appointed Spearhead Governor of the Tōsandō (東山道先鋒総督参謀).\nIjichi Masaharu has been described as an \"exceptional military tactician\" (類いまれな軍略家, tagui-mare na gun'ryaku-ka). At the Battle of Shirakawaguchi, Ijichi defeated an army of more than 2,500 men with only 700 soldiers under his command. He also provided tactical guidance at the Battle of Bonari Pass.\nIjichi's unique style of maneuver warfare revolved around small units of highly trained and heavily armed light infantry advancing rapidly. In accordance with the teachings of the aggressive Gōden school, he made extensive use of walking fire.\n\n\n== After the war ==\nDuring the Seikanron debate of 1873, Ijichi was a strong advocate of the conquest of Korea. In 1884, he was created a count (伯爵, hakushaku). He died on May 23, 1886. He is described as having had an intense personality and brilliant mind, but there exist many anecdotes of his eccentricities.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nCortazzi, Hugh (1985).

He belonged to the family of Turnbull of Bedrule in Roxburghshire. He was educated at the Hawick town school and at the university of Edinburgh, and, afterwards studied at Glasgow. About 1757 he settled at Wooler in Northumberland, and while there was chosen physician of the Bamborough infirmary. By the advice of Sir John Pringle he went to London in 1777, and shortly after was appointed physician to the eastern dispensary. He died in London on 2 May 1796. He was the author of several medical treatises of little importance. A collective edition of his ‘Works,’ with a memoir by his son, William Turnbull, was published in 1805, 12mo. Turnbull contributed the ‘medicinal, chemical, and anatomical’ articles to the ‘New and Complete Dictionary of Arts and Sciences’ (London, 1778, fol.).\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Carlyle, Edward Irving (1899). \"Turnbull, William (1729?-1796)\".

        "content": "Doug Mathews is an American jazz electric bassist, double bassist, and bass clarinetist best known for being a former member of multi-instrumentalist Sam Rivers' trio.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMathews became a member of Rivers' trio in 1993, two years after Rivers moved from New York to Florida, along with drummer Anthony Cole. The trio recorded three albums together: Firestorm (1998), Concept (1997), Caldera (2022). On the albums Concept and Caldera, Mathews played his second instrument, the bass clarinet, in order to form a woodwind trio with Cole on saxophone. Free jazz critic John Sharpe praised the group's collaboration, noting that Mathews' \"bowing segues into a spirited conversation between Rivers' soprano wail and Cole's intertwining tenor\". The trio with Mathews and Cole was described by Orlando Weekly writer Matt Gorney as \"an almost vaudevillian, recombinant band offering free bop, out funk, ballads, ruminant impressionism and, of course, the fire.\" Mathews was known to attend concerts by Rivers' original trio (with Dave Holland on bass and Barry Altschul on drums) when they performed.\nMathews joined the quintet of trombonist David Manson for the album Fluid Motion (2002), which included the trio from the Caldera recording plus Manson and trumpeter Jonathan Powell.\nIn 2010, Mathews was part of a tribute performance to Jack Kerouac; other performers and contributors included poet Frank Messina, arranger David Amram, and drummer Michael Welsh. Three years later, Mathews joined resident guitarist Mary Halvorson at the Atlantic Center for the Arts along with saxophonist Dan Jordan, trombonist Keith Oshiro, saxophonist David Pate, trumpeter Tom Parmerter and drummer Tomas Fujiwara. In 2023, Mathews was a member of the New York All-Star RivBea Orchestra, a group paying tribute to Rivers.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "William Johnson Walsham (27 June 1847 – 5 October 1903) was an English surgeon.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWalsham was born in London on 27 June 1847, was elder son of William Walker Walsham by his wife Louisa Johnson. Educated privately at Highbury, he early showed a mechanical bent, and was apprenticed to the engineering firm of Messrs. Maudslay. Soon turning to chemistry and then to medicine, he entered St. Bartholomew's Hospital in May 1867, and obtained the chief school prizes in his first and second years of studentship. In 1869 he gained the gold medal given by the Society of Apothecaries for proficiency in materia medica and pharmaceutical chemistry, and in 1870 was admitted a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries. He then proceeded to Aberdeen, where he graduated M.B. and C.M. in 1871 with the highest honours. Returning to London, he was admitted M.R.C.S. England on 17 November 1871. He served the offices of house physician and of house surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital; in 1872-3 was assistant demonstrator of anatomy in the medical school; full demonstrator 1873–80; demonstrator of practical surgery 1880–9; lecturer on anatomy 1889–97, and lecturer on surgery from 1897. Walsham was appointed assistant surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital on 10 March 1881, and took charge of the orthopaedic department. He became full surgeon in 1897.\nAt the Metropolitan Hospital he was elected surgeon in 1876, taking charge of the department for diseases of the nose and throat. He became consulting surgeon in 1896. He also served as surgeon to the Hospital for Diseases of the Chest from 1876 to 1884. At the Royal College of Surgeons Walsham was elected a fellow on 10 June 1875, was an examiner in anatomy on the conjoint board in 1892, and in surgery from 1897 to 1902.\nWalsham was a first-rate teacher of medical students. As a pupil of Sir John Struthers at Aberdeen, he early turned his attention to dissection, and many of his preparations were preserved at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. As surgical dresser to Sir James Paget he soon learned that pathology is the foundation of modern surgery, and of this fact he never lost sight. Physically delicate, he was unequal to the largest operations in surgery, but he excelled in those which required delicacy of touch, perfect anatomical knowledge, and perseverance, like the plastic operations of harelip and cleft palate and the tedious manipulations of orthopaedic surgery.\nHe died at 77 Harley Street, London, on 5 October 1903, and was buried at the Highgate cemetery. He married in 1876 Edith, the elder daughter of Joseph Huntley Spencer, but left no issue.\nWalsham published: \n\n'Surgery: its Theory and Practice,' 1887; 8th edit. 1903; a widely circulated textbook for students.\n'A Manual of Operative Surgery on the Dead Body,' conjointly with Sir Thomas Smith; 2nd edit. 1876.\n'A Handbook of Surgical Pathology for the use of Students in the Museum of St. Bartholomew's Hospital,' 1878; 2nd edit., with Mr. D'Arcy Power, 1890.\n'The Deformities of the Human Foot with their Treatment,' 1895.\n'Nasal Obstruction: the diagnosis of the various conditions causing it and their treatment,' 1898.\nWalsham edited the 'St. Bartholomew's Hospital Reports,' 1887–97, and contributed various articles to Christopher Heath's 'Dictionary of Surgery,' Frederick Treves's 'System of Surgery,' and to Henry Morris's 'Treatise on Anatomy.'\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Power, D'Arcy (1912). \"Walsham, William Johnson\".

        "content": "One Continuous Line: Art, Architecture and Urbanism of Aditya Prakash is a book by Indian architectural historian, author and academic Vikramaditya Prakash. Prakash explores the life and work of his father Aditya Prakash, a prominent figure in the first generation of Indian modernists. The book delves into Aditya Prakash's multifaceted career, from his early modernist works to his advocacy for academic inquiry in architecture. Through illustrated narratives and visual essays, the book presents insights into Prakash's philosophy, influences, and contributions to Indian architecture and urbanism.\n\n\n== Background ==\nVikramaditya Prakash is the son of Indian modernist architect Aditya Prakash. In an interview with the University of Washington, Prakash said that in trying to organize his father's extensive archive he and three volunteers started organizing his father's papers.\"It turned out there were over 1,000 architectural drawings, about 200 paintings, 600 art drawings, archival photographs, all kinds of things. I even found a regional, local museum drawing in his papers. It’s just an incredible treasure trove\" said Prakash who admittedly never intended to write a book. While trying to select the best out of his father's archive to publish them in a dedicated collection, he started working on an introduction \"initially thinking it would be a short text of around 5,000 to 10,000 words\".\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe work consists of an introduction, six core chapters, and a foreword by architect and curator Maristella Casciato. The book provides a comprehensive exploration of the life and work of Aditya Prakash (1924–2008), a prominent figure in Indian architecture. Through a blend of documentary evidence and personal recollections, Prakash offers insights into his father's career, focusing on his contributions to architecture, art, and urbanism, particularly in the context of postcolonial India. The book delves into Aditya Prakash's adherence to a minimalist aesthetic and disciplined approach to design, influenced by his association with mentors like Pierre Jeanneret and Le Corbusier. It highlights notable projects such as the Tagore Theatre, showcasing Prakash's ability to balance asceticism with monumentality and his dedication to simplicity and economy in architectural expression. The book also explores Prakash's multifaceted interests, including community theater and painting, as well as his role as an educator at the Chandigarh College of Architecture, where he challenged established norms and encouraged critical analysis. Extensively illustrated with black-and-white photographs and emphasizing Prakash's artistic legacy beyond architecture, the book offers insights into the broader scope of his work within the context of Indian modernism and the Global South.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nIn his review, landscape historian Manu P. Sobti praised the book for its innovative approach to biography within architectural historiography, highlighting Prakash's multifaceted persona and contributions to Indian modernism. Sobti commended Prakash's son, Vikramaditya Prakash, for skillfully weaving together personal observations and historical context, presenting a nuanced portrait of Aditya Prakash's life and work. The reviewer lauded the book's comprehensive structure, insightful narrative, and visually stunning presentation, anticipating its significant impact on architectural research, particularly in exploring the archives of the global South.\nIn their review, Peter Scriver and Amit Srivastava commended the book as a valuable addition to the discourse on modern Indian architecture. They particularly highlighted Prakash's methodological self-awareness, as he encourages a dispassionate analysis of his father's archive while blending it with personal recollections. The book is seen as a documentary contribution within a wave of publications focusing on post-independence Indian modernists, particularly as families compile and publish their archives. Scriver and Srivastava praised Prakash's counterpoint approach, which combines objective evidence with intimate insights into Aditya Prakash's career, thus enriching the understanding of his architectural legacy.\n\nElizabeth Grant wrote:One Continuous Line is more than a biography, it is a critical assessment of a designer, painter and philosopher and other actors positioned in the complex webbing of modernity, post-colonialism, and nation building. Embellished with valuable photographs, the book delivers a riveting, compelling and intimate account of the formative Nehruvian era from the perspective of one of its most important actors.\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 1909 Peruvian coup d'état attempt was an attempted coup d'état carried out on May 29, 1909 by relatives of former president Nicolás de Piérola and supporters of the Democratic Party, known as \"Pierolistas\" for their support of the former president. The brief episode was motivated by political tensions between the party and Congress and dissatisfaction with the unemployment caused by the Panic of 1907.\n\n\n== Coup ==\n\nOn May 29, 1909, a group of reportedly 36 people (out of 200 conspirators) affiliated with the Democratic Party met at the La Colmena Building in the Plazoleta de la Merced. Of these, 25 people, headed by Carlos, Amadeo and Isaías de Piérola—the brother and two sons of Nicolás de Piérola, former president of Peru—left towards the Calle Palacio soon after 2 p.m., guided by the clock of the Cathedral, arriving at a door of Government Palace.\nThe sentinel at the gate, Alejandro Champa y Quispe, was fatally shot, while another guard, Pedro Potenciano Choquehuanca, was wounded by four gunshots at the corridor that led to a waiting room. Once the group reached the presidential area, aide-de-camp Eulogio Eléspurucan attempted to stop them but was instead fatally shot, with the group reaching the room where President Augusto B. Leguía was located. Once Leguía was cornered, he was ordered to sign his resignation, but he immediately refused.\nWhile the Palace was being breached, a second—and much smaller—group headed by Orestes Ferro left for the Calle Pescadería, ambushing the guard of the Police Intendancy and disarming the soldiers there, talking over the Prefecture and the Ministry of Government. A third group of a little over 10 men unsuccessfully attempted to move through the Plaza Mayor, being stopped by the guards there.\nWith Leguía refusing to resign, he was taken with the group out of the building while being shot at from troops in its rooftop led by Major Augusto Paz. Miguel Abraham Rojas, who had accompanied Leguía up to that point, separated from the group, while Manuel Vicente Villarán joined them shortly before leaving the Palace. The small group paraded Leguía along the Jirón de la Unión until they reached Pando street, where the residences of Leguía and Augusto Durand Maldonado were located, and then changed course towards Inquisition Square, with an hour passing by until police intervened.\n\nOnce at the square, the group positioned themselves between the base of the equestrian statue of Simón Bolívar and the main door of the building that then housed the Senate. Again ordered to quit, Leguía calmly refused again. His response (Spanish: No firmo.) became famous after the event. Jorge Corbacho, a witness at the scene, denounced the events to the Army's general staff and demanded their action, which was initially ignored until a cavalry unit under the command of Alférez Enrique V. Gómez finally left towards the square.\nGómez initially returned without having taken action, but later returned and the group fired at the crowd, leaving several dead and wounded. Leguía and Villarán lay on the floor (the former pushed by civilian Roberto Lama, which was later credited with saving his life) while the conspirators escaped to nearby locations, including the Senate. Soon after, Gómez—armed with a revolver—and his men approached the two men. Leguía lay without his hat, his hair uncombed and covered with blood.\nCarlos de Piérola was injured by the gunfire, initially staying at the Senate building until 6 p.m. and then being taken to the nearby Swedish Consulate, then serviced by Consul-General Luis Lembcke, to be treated for his injuries. He had been injured three times, and his injuries included a gunshot in the hand.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\nHaving triumphed, Leguía, now on a horse and accompanied by high-ranking members of government and the Army, paraded through the city at around 6 p.m., with crowds cheering for him despite having previously shown indifference. Leguía recalled that, among the crowd, was one young man who had been very vocal in his protests against him hours before. Gómez was immediately promoted to lieutenant and soon after to captain by Congress.\nA group of curious onlookers, to which some of the fugitives had joined, was executed at random on the same afternoon by the Army in premises of the Senate. Meanwhile, some rebels at the Palace were instead spared by loyalist troops. Writers for the pro-Democrat newspaper La Prensa, as well as its director, Alberto Ulloa Cisneros, were taken to the Intendancy. On that same night, the newspaper's premises were attacked and looted by troops, who destroyed its machinery. Other enemies of the regime, such as Durand, were also persecuted and subjected to trial under the new premiership of Rafael Villanueva Cortez.\nNicolás de Piérola, who was having lunch at the residence of acquaintance Aurelio Sousa Matute Filipinas street (today the 5th block of Jr. Carabaya) during the events, denied having advanced knowledge of the events.\nAmadeo and Carlos de Piérola were both jailed at the Lima Penitentiary, while Isaías left for Bolivia. In February of the following year, Amadeo—accompanied by Orestes Ferro and Enrique Llosa—escaped from captivity. Pedro Portillo, then director of the penitentiary, was dismissed from his position.\nEléspuru and Choquehuanca, the guards killed when Government Palace was breached, where honoured with effigies inside the building. Avelino Céspedes, who was wounded during the events and died two days later, was also honoured, with his widow and children financially rewarded.\n\n\n== See also ==\n1872 Peruvian coup d'état, also short-lived\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Edward Strother (died 14 April 1737) was an English medical writer and physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nStrother born in Northumberland. He was perhaps son of Edward Strother, who was admitted an extra-licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians on 1 October 1700, and afterwards practised at Alnwick. On 8 May 1720 he graduated M.D. at the university of Utrecht, and on 3 April 1721 he was admitted a licentiate of the College of Physicians. He died on 14 April 1737 at his house near Soho Square.\nHe was the author of: \n\n‘A Critical Essay on Fevers,’ London, 1716, 8vo.\n‘Evodia, or a Discourse of Causes and Cures,’ London, 1718, 8vo.\n‘Pharmacopœia Practica,’ London, 1719, 12mo.\n‘D.

        "content": "Holding Hands (Chinese: 牽手; pinyin: Qiānshǒu) is the fourth studio album by Taiwanese singer A-Mei. It was released on October 12, 1998, by Forward Music. The album was produced by Forward Music's then-music director Chen Chih-yuan and was A-Mei's first original studio album since the death of her mentor Chang Yu-sheng eleven months prior. On the record, A-Mei sang Chang's posthumous works \"Are You Ready\" and \"After Knowing,\" and for the first time, she collaborated with David Tao on the songs \"Don't Lie To Me\" and \"High High High,\" which allowed A-Mei to try out different kinds of music creations. The music on Holding Hands fuses pop music with other genres including R&B, dance pop, adult contemporary and rock music.\nCommercially, Holding Hands was a success. The album was certified by Taiwan's IFPI as the top selling album of the year, selling over 790,000 copies in the span of one month. The album has since sold over 1.1 million copies in Taiwan, as well as over 5 million copies in Asia. To promote the album, A-Mei held a New Year's Eve concert titled \"Sisters Acting, Singing and Partying Through 1999\" at Nangang, Taipei.\n\n\n== Background and development ==\nOn December 29, 1997, A-Mei released the innovative album You Make Me Free Make Me Fly!, which served as an in advance listen for her very first concert tour that was to be held the following year in 1998. The album was a commercial success, selling 800,000 units in Taiwan, while also selling an additional 4 million copies throughout Asia.\nOn January 10, 1998, A-Mei held her first large-scale ticketed concert titled \"A-Mei In Concert Live In Concert 1998.\" It became the fastest-selling concert in Taiwan in the past 10 years and had a very fanatic audience, with both shows at the Taipei Municipal Stadium and Kaohsiung Central Park being full houses. On March 21, 1998, and March 22, 1998, she held two ticketed concerts at Hong Kong Coliseum. The two Hong Kong concerts were sold out within 8 hours after tickets going on sale, breaking the fastest ticket selling record in Hong Kong at the time. The 2 shows at the Singapore Indoor Stadium also set a number of records, including the record for the fastest sold-out concert: the first show was sold out within 10 hours while the second was sold out within 8 hours. In all, the tour drew in about 100,000 spectators. Work on her follow-up album began after the tour wrapped up.\n\n\n== Writing and recording ==\n\n\"Are You Ready\" and \"After Knowing\" were the two posthumous songs on the album written by Chang Yu-sheng. The latter was originally sung by Chang on his 1994 album Karaoke Live - Taipei - Me. \"Dreaming of Titanic\" is a synthesizer heavy ballad written by Wu Yukang and Chen Chih-yuan. \"Lonely Bowling\" is a reggae-style number written and composed entirely by Cheng Hua Jiuan. \"Surrender to Love\" is a melodic pop ballad written by Wu Yukang and composed by Guo Tzu. Two songs on the album, \"Don't Lie To Me\" and \"High High High,\" were written by David Tao. Both of the songs carried strong Americanized R&B influences.\nThe power ballad \"Blue Sky\" was written by Yu Guangyan and composed by Ian Chen and Chen Zhengqing. The album's title track is an upbeat pop rock song written by Chen Zhihan, also wrote the album's ninth track \"Open Your Eyes.\"\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nThe album's standard edition contains the 10 new songs. The second edition of the album comes in a cardboard slipcase with two independent VCDs in separate jewel cases. The first disc is a collection of music videos of the album Holding Hands, with lyrics to sing along to on karaoke. The second disc is a full live performance on Chinese television. No broadcast date is indicated, but it should be recent from the album's release date, since most of the songs off Holding Hands are played. Around the holiday season of 1998, Forward Music released a Christmas Special Edition of Holding Hands, which came in a slipcase and was packaged with a CD and a VCD. In 1999, Forward Music released a cassette edition of Holding Hands.\n\n\n=== Singles and music videos ===\nThe music videos for the songs \"Holding Hands\" and \"Dreaming of Titanic\" were both directed by renowned Taiwanese video director Kuang Sheng (鄺盛). The music videos for \"Don't Lie To Me,\" \"High High High,\" \"Open Your Eyes,\" \"Blue Sky\" and \"Lonely Bowling\" were directed by Jinhe Lin (林錦和). The music video for \"High High High\" features Taiwanese magician Lu Chen. The tracks \"After Knowing,\" \"Are You Ready\" and \"Surrender to Love\" use edited concert footage for their accompanying music videos, with the video for \"Surrender to Love\" featuring a cameo from Isaac Chen.\nIn January 1999, the tracks \"Holding Hands\" and \"Blue Sky\" were listed at number 2 and number 13 respectively on the 1998 Hit FM Top 100 Singles of the Year chart.\n\n\n== Accolades ==\nThe album Holding Hands earned A-Mei a nomination for Best Female Mandarin Singer at the 10th Golden Melody Awards. The album's title track was one of the winning songs of the 5th Chinese Top 20 Song Awards at the 5th China Music Awards, which was held by Channel V. The title track also won the silver Outstanding Mandarin song award at the 1998 RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards. In 1999, she won the award for \"The most powerful female singer in the music industry\" at the 1998 Top Music Chart Awards Ceremony hosted by TVB Jade and TVB.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Sales and certifications ==\n\n\n== References ==",

It is endemic to the Galápagos Islands.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nFirst described by the German lichenologist Gerhard Follmann in 1968, Roccella galapagoensis was discovered in abundance on the Galapagos Islands' South Plaza Island, particularly on the island's highest points. The official type specimen is held at the University of Colorado Museum, Boulder. Over the years, the species has been linked with several other names, including Roccella obscurissima, Roccella geniculata, Roccella glebaria, and Roccella colonii, based on specimens found in various locales across the Galapagos.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThis lichen species has a cylindrical thallus structure, with main branches usually measuring between 5 and 20 cm (2 and 8 in) in length. Its secondary branches are typically partially compressed but not markedly flattened. The thallus colour ranges from brownish-grey to grey. Ascomata, the fruiting bodies of the lichen, are present and have circular outlines with occasional undulating margins. Roccella lirellina, previously thought to form a species pair with Roccella galapagoensis, has been shown to have a distinct monophyletic genotype.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "William Stevenson (1719? – 13 April 1783) was an Irish physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nStevenson was Irish by birth. He was born about 1719, was first cousin to Andrew Thomas Stewart, sixth baron Stewart of Stewart Castle, co. Tyrone. The Stewarts removed to Scotland in consequence of the troublous times in Ireland at the beginning of the eighteenth century, and it was probably for this reason that Stevenson received his medical education at the university of Edinburgh. Here he studied under Alexander Monro I and Alexander Monro II, John Rutherford, Robert Whytt, and William Cullen. He graduated M.D. with the inaugural thesis ‘De Diabete,’ and remained in the city two years longer, partly to study medicine further and partly for instruction in divinity. He was one of the earliest members of the Edinburgh Medical Society, founded in 1737, and he appears to have served for a time in the army, for he says that he ‘was formerly commander of one of his majesty's forts.’ He practised for some time at Coleraine in Ireland, and then moved to Wells in Somerset, where he was practising as a physician in 1779. He lived for a short time at Bath, but moved to Newark at the end of May 1781. Here he died suddenly on 13 April 1783.\nA presbyterian in religion and a Jacobite in politics, Stevenson in his later years was constantly at variance with his surroundings. He hated the apothecaries, he despised the Royal College of Physicians, and he abhorred the therapeutic measures adopted by his contemporaries. His pen was venomous, and he spent his life lampooning and being lampooned. He appears to have been a shrewd physician, magnifying his calling, disbelieving in the efficacy of drugs or of bleeding, but with an abiding faith in the curative value of blisters and issues. His contemporaries regarded him as a malignant quack, who endeavoured to destroy their lucrative practice by explaining away the remedial action of the Bath waters in gout.\nHis works were:\n\n‘A Successful Method of treating the Gout by Blistering, with an Introduction consisting of Miscellaneous Matter,’ Bath, 1779, 8vo.\n‘Cases of Medicine interspersed with Strictures occasioned by some late Medical Transactions in the town of Newark,’ London, 1782, 8vo.\n‘Dr. Stevenson's Reply to a Letter addressed to Dr. Stevenson of Newark by Ed. Harrison,’ Newark, 1782, 8vo.\n‘Candid Animadversions on … a Singular Gouty Case, to which are prefixed Strictures on Royal Medical Colleges, likewise a summary Opinion of the late Disorder called the Influenza,’ Newark, 1782, 8vo.\n‘Considerations on the Dangerous Effects of Promiscuous Blood-letting and the common Preposterous Administration of Drugs, with other Coincident Subjects, Medical and Moral,’ Newark, 1783, 8vo. This work is incomplete, and was published after Stevenson's death.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Power, D'Arcy (1898). \"Stevenson, William (1719?-1783)\".

San Antonio Speedway would win this initial battle in 1978 when Pan American Speedway was forced to shut down.\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "The Woman's Club of Mesa was a women's club in Mesa, Arizona. Their former clubhouse building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is now the Guild of the Vale.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe General Federation of Women's Clubs of Arizona was established in 1901 and the Woman's Club of Mesa was founded in 1917 by 53 women. The group focused on social events, educational speakers, funding city parks, giving scholarships to students, and feeding hungry school children.\nIn 1923 after cotton prices crashed, the club and the city paid off the balance due on the property for Mesa's first hospital, preventing it from closure. Going forward, the club set aside time for \"hospital sew days\" where members would bring their sewing machines to the clubhouse and sew and create medical supplies.\nA number of improvements were made to the clubhouse over the years. In 1931, the junior members raised money for hardwood flooring. In 1937, a swamp cooler was added which was replaced with central air conditioning in 1989. The year before, in 1988, a wheelchair ramp was installed. \nIn 1990 when the club became inactive, they donated their building to the General Federation of Women's Clubs of Arizona to serve as a headquarters. The building was subsequently sold to the Guild of the Vale, a for profit business running the facility as an event venue.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe 1931, Phoenix architect Henry C. Grote designed the clubhouse in a Spanish Colonial Revival style. Joseph Nesbitt, whose wife was a member of the club, was selected as the builder after submitting a very low quote of only $10,580. The one-story building  is rectangular except for the kitchen in the rear.\nThe exterior of the building is painted white brick with a simple cornice detail running along the top of all the facades. Above each window is a Roman arch with articulated impost blocks and plain tympanum panels.\nThe most prominent architectural feature is a stucco turret with inlaid tiles in a diamond pattern. Under the turret, the main entrance which is surrounded by a corbel arch with brick columns topped with a bracket-like medallions. Above the door is a sign shaped like a banner and a semi-circular fanlight window. The roof of the turret has mission tiles made of terra cotta. \nThe interior is dominated by a large open hall with a stage but also includes a kitchen, restrooms, storage room, and a backstage area. The walls are lathe and plaster with coved ceilings. Arabesque plaster detailing flank the fireplace, stage, and entry room.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of women's clubs\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Maricopa County, Arizona\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGuild of the Vale website\nGeneral Federation of Women's Clubs of Arizona",

The monastery is affiliated with the monastery of San Giovanni Evangelista, Parma.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe construction of the initial abbey was commissioned circa 1471 by Count Pier Maria II De’ Rossi at the site of a medieval oratory or small church to house a Benedictine congregation derived from the Abbey of Santa Giustina. The Romanesque-style church with a single nave and attached bell-tower was dedicated to Sancta Maria ad Nives, a common Marian devotion. The facade faces east. The sacristy and church still retain frescoes. \nThe abbey was shuttered during the Napoleonic occupation, and requisitioned as a barracks. In 1899, it was returned to the Benedictines. The abbey staffed by nuns and oblates offers housing for retreats and a guesthouse for single visitors. Reservations can be made for lunch at the refectory. The abbey has a store that sells honey and products of the orchard.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Gangneung Kim clan (Korean: 강릉 김씨; Hanja: 江陵 李氏)  is a Korean clan, with the bon-gwan (ancestral seat) based in Gangneung, Gangwon Province, South Korea.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe progenitor of the clan is considered to be Kim Chu-wŏn. Kim Chu-wŏn was the relative of Hyegong of Silla and the rightful heir to the throne. However, as Kim did not reside in the capital of Gyeongju, he needed to cross the Alcheon River (modern-day Bukcheon stream) to be proclaimed king after death of King Seondeok of Silla. Due to heavy rainfall, the river was flooded and Kim Chu-wŏn could not cross and make it to the capital. The nobles of Gyeongju instead picked Kim Kyŏng-sin to be the new king. Kim Chu-wŏn was compensated by being enfeoffed as the Prince of Myŏngju (modern-day Gangneung).\nAs a part of the Silla royalty, they were true bone caste in Silla's bone-rank system. In 822, Kim Chu-wŏn's son, Kim Hŏn-ch'ang, rebelled against the Silla government and attempted to create his own kingdom of Jangan, based in Ungju. Kim Hŏn-ch'ang was defeated and he committed suicide to avoid capture. 239 of his relatives were killed. His son, Kim Pŏm-mun, also attempted a rebellion against Silla 3 years later at Hansan near Seoul, but he too failed.\nA majority of the clan is descended from Kim Chu-wŏn's third son, Kim Sin (김신; 金身) who chose to stay in Gangneung. The Gangneung Kims still residing in Gangneung would become the regional lords or hojoks of Gangneung, taking advantage of their true bonk status. They were key supporters of Wang Kŏn, with individuals such as Kim Ye and Kim Sun-sik contributing to the founding of Goryeo. The grateful Wang Kŏn granted a branch of the Gangneung Kim clan with his own surname of Wang, who were known as the Gangneung Wang clan. During the early Goryeo period from 981 to 1146, they produced nine government officials, five of whom were high officials, making them the clan with the fifth most officials produced in this timeframe.\nIn the 2015 South Korean census, 179,593 individuals who were members of the Gangneung Kim clan.\n\n\n== Members ==\nKim Chu-wŏn, founder\nKim Hŏn-ch'ang\nKim Yang, Silla government official\nKim Ye, Gangneung regional lord\nKim Si-seup, Joseon scholar-official\nKim Hae-gyeong, pen name Yi Sang, Korean poet and author\nKim Moon-ki, South Korean politician\nKim Jin-sun, South Korean politician\nAnatoli Kim, Russian-Korean writer\nKim Nam-il, South Korean footballer\nKim Rae-won, South Korean actor\nKim Nam-joon, stage name RM, South Korean musician, member of BTS\n\n\n== See also ==\nKim (Korean surname)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Cladonia flavocrispata is a species of fruticose lichen in the family Cladoniaceae. Found in Venezuela and described as a new species in 2013, it is closely related to Cladonia hians, but is distinguished by its unique chemical composition and morphology.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nDescribed by the lichenologists Teuvo Ahti and Harrie Sipman in 2013, Cladonia flavocrispata was first collected in Venezuela in 1990, within a rocky sandstone area featuring scrub on an exposed ridge at the Cerro Guaiquinima. This species is characterised by its pale green, evanescent primary thallus, and podetia that are pale greenish grey, forming dense, erect cushions.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe primary thallus of Cladonia flavocrispata is evanescent and pale green, appearing as scattered, small squamules in the lower part of the podetia, measuring roughly 0.2–0.5 by 1 mm. These squamules are simple or slightly split into irregularly crenulate laciniae, without soredia. Podetia can reach 5–12 cm in height, displaying indeterminate growth and a pale greenish-grey colouration. The lower parts are strongly variegated with pale greenish grey and brown to black patches. The podetia typically form dense, erect cushions with main stems about 1.0–1.5 mm wide. The surface of the podetia is matt and discontinuously very thinly corticate, revealing most of the stereome with age. Chemical analysis reveals the presence of thamnolic and usnic acids, occasionally accompanied by barbatic acid, with colour reactions of P+ (yellow), K+ (yellow), and KC+ (yellow).\n\n\n== Distribution and ecology ==\nCladonia flavocrispata is endemic to the Guiana Highlands, primarily found in Venezuela. It occupies humid sandstone tablelands, growing on sandstone flats with open bog vegetation at elevations ranging from 400 to 2,500 m (1,300 to 8,200 ft). While there are three uncertain collections from the Guianas, specifically from the sandstone plateau of the Kaieteur Falls, these may differ slightly in morphological characteristics.\n\n\n== Similar species ==\nWhile Cladonia flavocrispata shares similarities with Cladonia hians, it can be distinguished by its larger size and the presence of usnic acid. It may also resemble C. vareschii, which has a more intense yellow colour and somewhat thicker cortex. However, the presence of squamules, although often scarce, differentiates C. flavocrispata from these species.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Cladonia species\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Haemulon melanurum, the cottonwick grunt, is a species of ray-finned fish within the family Haemulidae. The species is found inhabiting tropical waters in the western Atlantic near parts of North and South America. The species can grow to a maximum length of 43.5 centimeters, however individuals are most commonly found at lengths of 25 centimeters. The maximum published weight of the species was 550 grams. Adults are silver in coloration with narrow yellow stripes running along the body, with a bronze line in front of the eye. Adults also possess a black line running from the beginning of the dorsal fins to the caudal fins. It is an oviparous schooling fish that feeds on crustaceans.\n\n\n== Distribution & habitat ==\nThe cottonwick grunt is found distributed in much of the Caribbean and other nearby areas, spanning from northern Brazil to southeastern Florida and Veracruz, as well as southeastern Texas and Bermuda. Habitats include clear waters up to 50 meters deep, often alongside reefs and adjacent seagrass beds. It may also be found alongside shipwrecks that act as artificial reefs.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nThe cottonwick grunt is currently assessed as 'Least concern' by the IUCN Red List. Adults are often abundant in some areas. The species currently has minor commercial importance to fisheries and the aquarium trade. It can potentially be impacted by localised overfishing and invasive lionfish that may eat small growing individuals. However, there is little evidence to suggest global scale declines from these threats.\n\n\n== References ==",

He is a member of the Liberal Party.\n\n\n== Political career ==\n\n\n=== Government staffer ===\nBefore running for office, Blomeley was chief of staff to Tasmanian Liberal senator David Bushby, the Chief Government Whip in the Senate.\nIn 2017, he was convicted and fined $2000 for using a carriage service to harass his inlaws, Julia Edwards and Ted Edwards. The conviction was set aside in 2018, but Blomeley was required to enter into an 18-month good behaviour bond on each of the two counts.\n\n\n=== Clarence City Council ===\nBlomeley contested the 2018 Tasmanian local govermment elections as an Independent Liberal. He had 3.10% of the vote and was the last candidate elected after preference distribution.\nIn 2022, he announced his candidacy for mayor of Clarence, leading the \"Better Clarence\" ticket. He was successful in a close race, elected with 50.81% of the vote against Tony Mulder after preference distribution.\nBlomeley was passed over for Liberal Party Senate preselection in 2023 because he did not disclose he had been charged with breaching an apprehended violence order (AVO) in 2017.\nAt the 2024 Tasmanian state election, he considered contesting the division of Franklin as an independent candidate, although ultimately chose not to.\nBlomeley was at the Westfield shopping centre in Bondi Junction, Sydney, on 13 April 2024 when a man stabbed and killed multiple people.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Lankford v. Idaho, 500 U.S. 110 (1991), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the petitioner, Bryan Lankford, had been unconstitutionally sentenced to death in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court held 5–4 that Lankford had not received adequate notice that he could be sentenced to death before the trial judge imposed such a sentence on him, and therefore reversed the prior ruling to the contrary by the Idaho Supreme Court.\n\n\n== Background ==\nBryan Lankford, along with his brother Mark Lankford, was convicted of the double murder of Robert and Cheryl Bravence, a couple from Texas vacationing in Idaho. The murder took place in 1983, and the Lankford brothers were convicted of it the following year. At Bryan Lankford's trial, the prosecutor had explicitly told the judge that he would not seek the death penalty, and it was not discussed during the subsequent sentencing hearing. Nevertheless, the following week, the judge sentenced both Bryan and Mark Lankford to death, and the Idaho Supreme Court upheld both brothers' death sentences. Both brothers then appealed their sentences to the United States Supreme Court, which granted certiorari in Bryan's case while denying it in Mark's case.\n\n\n== Opinion of the Court ==\nThe majority opinion was written by Justice John Paul Stevens and joined by Thurgood Marshall, Harry Blackmun, Sandra Day O'Connor, and Anthony Kennedy. The dissenting opinion was written by Justice Antonin Scalia and joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, as well as by Byron White and David Souter. Because Justice O'Connor was in the majority, this case marked the first one of the 1990–1991 term in which Souter and O'Connor were on opposite sides. \n\n\n== Impact ==\nAfter the Supreme Court's decision in Lankford v. Idaho, Bryan Lankford's sentence was commuted from death to life in prison. As of 2018, he remains incarcerated at Idaho State Correctional Center in Boise. The case also created what has become known as the \"Lankford notice exception\", which states that if, after an arraignment of a criminal defendant, a prosecutor indicates to the judge that they will not seek the death penalty, it is an unconstitutional violation of due process to impose the death penalty on that defendant.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nText of Lankford v.

        "content": "Carlos de Aniceto \"Liceu\" Vieira Dias (1 May 1919 – 19 August 1994) was an Angolan musician and anti-colonial activist, considered to be the father of Angolan popular music. A member of the Angolan musical group Ngola Ritmos, he was considered was considered an exemplary guitarist and singer. Active in the struggle for an independent Angola, he was one of the founding members of the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA).\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLiceu's parents, José Vieira Dias and Jaquenita do Aniceto de Carvalho, were originally from northern Angola and were of Kongo origin. They migrated to Luanda, where Liceu was born on 1 May 1919. Liceu was one of the couples ten children, the others being Fernando Torres Vieira Dias, Domingas Torres Vieira Dias, José Vieira Dias Filho, Antónia Diniz de Aniceto Vieira Dias, Joaquim Militão Vieira Dias, Zita Vieira Dias, Manuel Helder Vieira Dias, Novato Vieira Dias, and Bernardo Vieira Dias.\nDuring his youth he was a sportsman, being both in athletics and in football as a player for Clube Atlético de Luanda. His nickname \"Liceu\" came from the Liceu Salvador Correia in Luanda, which had been inaugurated a little before his birth. The nickname was part of a larger trend at that time to name children in relation to some relevant fact or event that had occurred around the time of their birth.\nHe began his musical career while a government employee at the National Bank of Angola in the 1930s, a position he held until he was imprisoned in 1959. He was forced out of the institution in 1962, after a disciplinary process claimed that he frequently did not show up for work despite having been imprisoned during that time period.\nLiceu was one of the founders of Ngola Ritmos in 1947. The musical group was founded at the house of Manuel dos Passos in the Bairro Operário neighborhood of Luanda. It was founded by Liceu, Nino Mário Araújo “Ndongo“, and Domingos Van-Dúnen. Soon after forming the group, they were joined by Francisco Machado, Lourdes Van-Dúnem, and Belita Palma. With melodies played on acoustic guitars, they also played the dicanza and ngoma drums in their songs. Their style of music became popular from the 1940s to the 1960s, largely in urban areas that were sympathetic to their political and nationalist messages. Liceu and the group have since become known as pioneers in Angolan popular music, having also sung in Kimbundu versus the colonially imposed Portuguese.\nLiceu was also one of the co-founders of the Movement for the Independence of Angola (MIA) and MPLA. He was later imprisoned for more than a decade at Tarrafal concentration camp in  Cape Verde, being implicated in the Trial of Fifty. By the time he had left prison in the 1970s, Liceu attempted to reunite the members of N'Gola Ritmos again, but encountered major difficulties due to political persecution. They were effectively blocked out of public performances or political activities. After the war for Angola's independence ended in 1975, the subsequent civil war brought a rapid decline to musical productions in Angola. In 1978, N'gola Ritmos made their last public appearance with all of their members. Liceu began performing solo afterwards.\nLiceu died on 19 August 1994 in Lisbon, Portugal.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nLiceu married Maria Natércia de Almeida Vieira Dias in 1949, having 4 children with her: Carlitos Vieira Dias, Luzia Zizi, Ferdinando \"Xinito\" Vieira Dias, and Felipe de Nery \"Pino\" Vieira Dias.\nHis nephew, Ruy Mingas, recorded the song \"Homenagem a Liceu Vieira Dias\" as a tribute to Liceu. Mingas also wrote the national anthem of Angola, Angola Avante. Liceu's family members also include Ruy's brother André Mingas, who is also a singer and composer; Saíde Mingas, an economist who became a major leader in the MPLA during the Civil War; and linguist and investigator Amélia Mingas. His other nephews include Hélder Vieira Dias, a top military general in Angola, and Filomeno do Nascimento Vieira Dias, the current Archbishop of Luanda. He was also related to fellow anticolonial leader and nationalist Mário Pinto de Andrade.\n\n\n== Honors ==\n\nIn 2009, the documentary \"Estórias para a História da Música Angolana\", by Mário Rui Silva, was released, which classifies Liceu as a legendary figure in Angolan popular music and as one of the most important artists in the country's history.\nThe film \"O Lendário Tio Liceu e os N'gola Ritmos\", by Jorge António, received the Best Documentary Award at the International Film Festival of Luanda in 2010.\n\n\n== References ==",

The livestreams also include third-party titles. The Developer Direct usually takes place at the beginning of each year in January.\n\n\n== History ==\nXbox Developer Direct was founded as part of Microsoft's ongoing efforts to enhance communication and engagement with gamers worldwide. Prior to Devolder Direct, some critics argued that Xbox needed to have a showcase to establish \"brand identity\" and differentiate themselves from other competitors. Additionally, there were suggestions that Xbox should be more transparent regarding the development of their video games. The first showcase was announced on January 11, 2023, and took place on January 25, 2024.  Developer Direct has evolved and expanded. Initially focusing on presentations from Xbox Game Studios and Bethesda Softworks, in 2024 the event series has grown to encompass a broader range of developers and publishers, including third-party titles.\n\n\n== Format ==\nEach Xbox Developer Direct event typically features a combination of announcements, trailers, gameplay reveals, and developer interviews. These presentations offer audiences a look into upcoming games, downloadable content (DLC), expansion packs, updates, and other relevant developments. The format allows developers to showcase their games directly to fans and consumers and announce brand-new video game content.\n\n\n== List of events ==\n\n\n=== Xbox Developer Directs ===\n\n\n=== Other Xbox showcases after 2023 ===\n\n\n==== Summer Showcases ====\n\n\n==== Xbox Partner Previews ====\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On 3 April 2024, at 07:58:11 NST (23:58:11 UTC on 2 April), a Mw 7.4 earthquake struck 18 km (11 mi) south-southwest of Hualien City, Hualien County, Taiwan. At least 17 people were killed  and over 1,100 were injured in the earthquake. It is the strongest earthquake in Taiwan since the 1999 Jiji earthquake, with several aftershocks above Mw 5.0.\n\n\n== Tectonic setting ==\n\nTaiwan has a history of strong earthquakes. The island is located within a complex zone of convergence between the Philippine Sea Plate and Eurasian Plate. At the location of the earthquake, these plates converge at a rate of 75 millimetres (3.0 in) per year. To the south of Taiwan, oceanic crust of the Eurasian Plate is subducting beneath the Philippine Sea Plate creating an island arc, the Luzon Arc. At Taiwan, the oceanic crust has all been subducted and the arc is colliding with continental crust of the Eurasian Plate. To the north of Taiwan, the Philippine Sea Plate is in contrast subducting beneath the Eurasian Plate, forming the Ryukyu Arc.\n\n\n== Earthquake ==\n\nTaiwan's Central Weather Administration (CWA) measured the earthquake's local magnitude at 7.2, while the United States Geological Survey (USGS) placed the earthquake at Mw 7.4. At least 681 aftershocks were recorded following the earthquake. A Mw 6.4 aftershock struck at 00:11 UTC, followed by a Mw 5.7 event at 00:35, a Mw 5.5 at 00:43 and a Mw 5.7 at 00:46. The mainshock was the strongest earthquake to hit Taiwan since the 1999 Jiji earthquake, which measured Mw 7.7.\nThe earthquake had a maximum CWA seismic intensity of 6+ in Hualien City and 5- in Taipei. Intensity 4 or higher was felt across much of the island except its southern extent, which felt intensities 2 to 3. In China, shaking was felt in Shanghai, Suzhou, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Shantou, and parts of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu provinces. It was also felt in Hong Kong and on the island of Yonaguni, Japan, where it measured Shindo 4 on the Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale.\nThe earthquake had a focal mechanism corresponding to reverse-faulting at a 34.8 km (21.6 mi) depth. According to the USGS, the rupture occurred on a northeast–southwest-striking, moderately dipping, reverse fault within the Eurasian Plate. The estimated rupture dimensions for a similarly sized reverse-faulting earthquake is 60 km (37 mi) by 35 km (22 mi). Its finite fault model indicated rupture on an east-southeast dipping plane. The slip occurred within an elliptical rupture area 60 km (37 mi) by 60 km (37 mi) on the plane. The maximum displacement was estimated at 1.2471 m (4 ft 1.10 in). The shock's magnitude was identical to a 1986 earthquake that killed 15 people in Hualien.\nThe China Earthquake Administration (PRC) estimated the earthquake rupture process did not exceed 35 seconds in duration. The slip was distributed across a fault 50 km (31 mi) across. According to their finite fault model, slip was mainly concentrated around the epicenter, reaching 3 m (9.8 ft) of maximum displacement. The model's geometry consists of a northeast striking fault dipping at a shallow angle to the northwest. About 1 m (3 ft 3 in) of slip occurred at the shallow part of the fault that reaches the seafloor off the island's coast.\n\n\n== Tsunami ==\n\nA 0.5 m (1 ft 8 in) tsunami was observed in Chenggong, Taitung, while an 82 cm (32 in) wave was recorded in Wushi Harbor. The CWA issued an alert advising residents to evacuate to higher ground. The Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China issued a second-highest level orange tsunami alert, warning of potential localized waves that could cause significant damage in affected coastal areas.\nIn the Philippines, evacuations were ordered by the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council in the provinces of Batanes, Cagayan, Isabela and Ilocos Norte following a warning by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS). An advisory was issued to 23 provinces for \"high tsunami waves\" measuring 3 m (9.8 ft), which was later reduced to 30 cm (12 in). At 10:03 (PST), the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said \"the tsunami threat has now largely passed,\" prompting PHIVOLCS to cancel the tsunami warning.\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency issued a tsunami warning for Okinawa Prefecture and as waves of 3 m (9.8 ft) were expected, which was later downgraded to a \"tsunami advisory\". A 30 cm (12 in) wave was observed at Yonaguni about 15 minutes after the earthquake. Waves were also expected along the Miyako and Yaeyama Islands, with 20 cm (7.9 in)-waves reaching the islands of Miyako-jima and Ishigaki. The tsunami warning was the first to be issued in Okinawa Prefecture since the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, while the tsunami was the first to strike the area since 1998. These warnings prompted flight suspensions in Okinawa and Kagoshima Prefectures; evacuations to the third floors were held at Naha Airport and Miyako Airport. The Japan Self-Defense Forces ordered its air assets at Naha Air Base to fly out or be moved to secure hangars or higher ground to prevent its possible destruction. China's Tsunami Warning Centre, which is under the Ministry of Natural Resources, issued its highest alert level at level 1, or red.\n\n\n== Impact ==\nSeventeen fatalities have been reported, along with a total of 1,145 people injured and 442 others declared stranded. Two people were listed as missing, namely a couple carrying dual Australian and Singaporean nationality. The National Fire Agency recorded at least 1,151 earthquake-related incidents.\nAll fatalities occurred in Hualien County. Among the dead were four killed in Taroko National Park, including three hikers who were caught in a rockfall. Another person died when rockfalls occurred at the Daqingshui Tunnel along the Suhua Highway and crushed his truck. One person also died after their car was hit by a falling boulder at the parking lot of the Huide Tunnel along the Suhua Highway, while another fatality occurred inside a mine in Hejen after a rock fall. Five members of the same family were killed following a rockfall in Taroko National Park. along with a total of 1,145 people injured and 442 others declared stranded. A woman in Hualien died after she returned to her building to retrieve her cat, during which she was pinned down by a column following an aftershock. The cat was later found trapped between metal bars on a window of the building and was rescued on 9 April along with another cat that was also trapped on a window, during which demolition works were temporarily suspended.\nTaiwan's earthquake alert system did not send an advance alert of the mainshock, unlike in previous instances. Authorities later said that they had initially estimated the earthquake to be of a smaller magnitude ranging between 6.2 and 6.8. The CWA Seismology Center later clarified that it had sent out two alerts that covered the immediate area of the epicenter as well as parts of southern and central Taiwan but not the Taipei area, adding that conditions for issuing a national-level warning depended on the earthquake measuring a magnitude above five and its intensity reaching four on the CWA's seven-level scale.\nSix hundred people were stranded in Taroko National Park. Twelve park visitors, including two Canadian nationals, were stranded along a trail, while 40 others were injured. Injuries were also reported across Hualien City, Yilan, Taipei, New Taipei City, Keelung, Taichung and Taoyuan due to falls or toppled objects. Sixty people were trapped inside the 400 m (1,300 ft) Jinwen Tunnel along the Suhua Highway, while 50 employees of the Silk's Place Hotel Taroko who were traveling in four minibuses were also declared trapped after none of them could be contacted by authorities over the phone. The hotel management later said that the employees were safe, citing three staff who had reached the hotel on foot. A rescued employee later said that their convoy had been trapped in a tunnel following a rockfall and that the vehicle she was in was severely damaged by a rock. The road immediately outside the Qingshui Tunnel caved in, trapping several people inside. Seventy people were also trapped in two rock quarries, while nine people were trapped inside a cave.\nThe Central Emergency Operation Center reported at least 2,498 cases of damage nationwide following the earthquake, with 1,140 instances in Taipei, 497 in New Taipei and 366 in Hualien County. At least 870 buildings and 75 roads and tunnels were damaged by the earthquake. Of the 28 reported building collapses, 17 of them occurred in Hualien, while the other 11 occurred in Yilan, New Taipei and Keelung. Collapses trapped at least 20 people in the immediate aftermath. Twelve buildings deemed unsafe were ordered demolished by authorities. In Hualien City, two houses, the nine-story Uranus building and a restaurant collapsed, trapping many people inside. One person was found dead while 22 others were later rescued from the Uranus building, which was built in 1986 prior to the introduction of more stringent building codes in the wake of the 1999 Jiji earthquake and was found to be lacking supporting ground-floor front pillars. Forty-eight residential buildings in the city were damaged, and the National Hualien Girls' Senior High School also sustained heavy damage. At least 200 residents living near the epicenter were displaced. A total of 1,400 households in Hualien Country were damaged.\nIn Taipei, 249 people were injured, six of them seriously, and 10 houses were severely damaged. A warehouse collapsed in New Taipei City, causing three minor injuries. Fifty people were subsequently rescued from the building. Tiles were dislodged and fell off older buildings and some newer structures in the capital. The Legislative Yuan building also sustained damage to its walls and ceilings, while debris fell from the Liberty Square archway of Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall. Subsidence in Xindian District caused seven houses to collapse, forcing 12 people to evacuate. A viaduct of the New Taipei Circular Line between Banxin and Zhongyuan stations was disaligned, while a train was derailed at Jingan station, damaging the station platform and track bed. All service on the Taipei Metro was briefly suspended for safety checks. Nevertheless, train service through the epicenter region was restored within 24 hours. A portion of the ceiling in Taoyuan International Airport collapsed. Another 68 people were injured in Yilan City, where walls collapsed and water pipes ruptured. In Nantou County, 66 schools and nine houses sustained damage.\nPower outages affected 371,869 homes in Taiwan according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, of which, 14,833 were in Taichung; 5,306 were restored within approximately 25 minutes of the earthquake. Electricity was restored in 70 percent of households within two hours of the earthquake by Taipower, leaving around 91,000 homes without power. By the morning of 4 April, the number was reduced to 337. Water shortages affected 125,675 households, while outages of natural gas affecting 394 households and internet disruptions were also reported. Eighty cell phone base stations were damaged. There were reports of damaged walls, debris and toppled bricks across much of the island. High-speed railway services across Taiwan were partially suspended and major expressways in the eastern part of the island were closed. No anomalies were recorded in any of Taiwan's three nuclear plants.\nA total of 779 landslides were recorded following the earthquake, affecting 433.93 hectares. A massive landslide occurred near Xiulin. The Suhua Highway was closed after sections of it were struck by at least nine rockfalls. Rockfalls occurred on another highway which hit at least 12 cars and injured nine people. A landslide along Provincial Highway 9 between Su'ao and Hualien blocked traffic at Chongde railway station, while a rockfall also occurred in the Heren-Chongde section of the Eastern Trunk line in Hualien. A section of the Central Cross-Island Highway between Dayuling and Taroko was also closed. Two German nationals were reported to have been trapped in a tunnel in Hualien. In Taichung, rockfalls blocked a road, damaging three cars and injuring a driver. A large portion of Guishan Island collapsed into the sea.\nSix F-16 fighter jets of the Republic of China Air Force were slightly damaged at a base in Hualien. At the distillery of the Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corporation in Hualien, around 192,000 alcohol bottles were shattered, causing financial losses of at least NT$14 million (US$435,845). The earthquake also destroyed 1,000 vats of Shaoxing wine in the distillery. The Education Ministry said that 434 schools suffered damage from the earthquake totaling NT$470 million (US$14.66 million), mostly in Hualien and Pingtung Counties and Hsinchu City. The Hualien County Tourism Association estimated damage to tourism from the earthquake to reach NT$5.3 billion (US$166 million), with hotel booking rates expected to drop to less than 10%. The Interior Ministry said damage to the Taroko National Park reached NT$1 billion (US$30.92 million). \nThe Ministry of Agriculture estimated agricultural damage from the earthquake at NT$80.8 million (US$2.53 million), with Hualien County accounting for NT$79.15 million. Most of the damage in the county came from losses to the fishing industry at NT$40.95 million, while the remaining NT$1.05 million coming from damages to livestock facilities and loss of animal feed in the county. Crop losses reached up to NT$10,000 and affected 0.3 hectares of farmland, primarily those cultivated with wood ear mushrooms. The ministry also said Hualien incurred NT$25.98 million in damage to agricultural infrastructure, with NT$13.98 million coming from fisheries infrastructure, as well as NT$50,000 in livestock losses, mainly to pigs. Damage to public agricultural infrastructure in Hualien was estimated at NT$33.98 million, with NT$20 million coming from soil and water conservation infrastructure.\nRailway services were temporarily suspended in parts of eastern China due to the earthquake.\n\n\n== Response ==\nIncumbent Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen expressed concern about the damage and ordered the ROC Armed Forces to support the local government in Hualien and others parts of the island in rescue missions. Vice-president and president-elect Lai Ching-te called on the public to be careful and stay calm and announced the formation of an emergency centre to deal with the disaster. In the afternoon of 3 April, Lai visited Hualien County to inspect rescue and relief efforts, while Premier Chen Chien-jen visited temporary shelters for displaced residents in Hualien on 4 April. Chen also announced that the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics would allocate NT$300 million (US$9,366,144) in disaster relief to the Hualien County government and would exempt from taxation income received by affected residents taking up temporary employment because of the earthquake. Tsai, Lai, Chen and Vice Premier Cheng Wen-tsan also pledged to donate a month's worth of their salaries for disaster relief. Tsai also warned citizens against non-essential travel to mountains for the long weekend brought about by the Qingming Festival, which began a day after the earthquake. On 10 April, Tsai visited affected areas of Hualien County and Taroko National Park, where she met with rescue workers. The Executive Yuan subsequently allotted more than NT$20 billion (US$614.9 million) in disaster relief to Hualien County.\nHualien County magistrate Hsu Chen-wei said all residents and businesses in buildings that were in a dangerous state had been evacuated. Low-orbit satellites were used to facilitate communications in their first deployment for a disaster in Taiwan. Helicopters were deployed by the National Airborne Service Corps to rescue at least 82 stranded individuals, including trapped miners and drop food to stranded individuals pending rescue. Emergency workers propped up the Uranus building with gravel and rocks to prevent it from completely falling over in an aftershock. Demolition works on the building began on 5 April and finished on 17 April. The Health Ministry placed medical staff in Yilan and Taitung on stand-by to help victims in Hualien. The mayor of Kaohsiung, Chen Chi-mai, also ordered the deployment of a rescue team and dogs to Taroko National Park.\nThe Ministry of Transportation and Communications initiated maritime ferry services between Su'ao Port in Yilan County and the Port of Hualien beginning on 4 April, while Mandarin Airlines and UNI Air added seven extra flights between Hualien Airport and the rest of Taiwan. Railway services between Hualien and Yilan Counties reopened on 4 April following repairs and clearing operations by the Taiwan Railway Corporation. The New Taipei City Government opened 15 shelters for 269 displaced residents and offered free bus rides to alleviate complications on transportation brought by the earthquake, particularly on the railway system. Partial operations at the New Taipei Circular Line resumed on the afternoon of 3 April, with other sections reopening on 7 April, leaving only a portion of the line between Banqiao and Zhonghe stations still under repair.\nSeveral semiconductor firms, including Powerchip, InnoLux, UMC, King Yuan Electronics Company, Taimide Tech, and TSMC temporarily suspended operations and evacuated their facilities in Hsinchu. TSMC said it expected losses of about $60 million from the earthquake and reported minimal damage to some of its facilities and equipment, adding that more than 70 percent of its chip manufacturing equipment had resumed production later on 3 April. Other manufacturers resumed operations on 4 April. The Taiwan Stock Exchange continued regular operations on 3 April despite the earthquake.\nThe Health Ministry and the Hualien County government set up dedicated bank accounts and online platforms for receiving earthquake-related donations. The Finance Ministry also said that 12 government-owned businesses would donate a total of NT$21 million. The Health Ministry said it had received at least NT$720 million (US$22.35 million) in donations by 11 April. and released NT$490 million in aid. The Taiwan Foundation for Disaster Relief announced that it had received more than NT$900 million in donations by 15 April. The Ministry of Economic Affairs said that it was planning to provide loans totaling NT$20 billion to support affected businesses, and introduced vouchers and subsidies to support the tourism industry in Hualien.\nSeveral prominent Taiwanese firms announced donations towards disaster relief. Foxconn pledged NT$80 million while its founder, Terry Gou personally pledged NT$60 million. Taishin Financial Holdings pledged NT$10 million while Acer Inc. pledged NT$6 million. Quanta Computer and Fubon Financial Holding Co. respectively pledged donations of NT$50 million for earthquake relief, while Wanin International Co., Tung Ho Steel Enterprise Corp., and Yageo pledged a combined total of NT$36 million. The Red Cross Society of the Republic of China and the Tzu Chi foundation provided meals and shelters to displaced residents.\nTaipei 101 was lit up on the night of 3 April in memory of the victims of the earthquake.\nFollowing criticism over alleged lapses in issuing warnings over the earthquake, the CWA said that it would issue a national-level warning for future incidents and adjust conditions for issuing alerts to accommodate a flexible margin of error, rather than just taking a single value into account to ensure enough time for preparations by the public.\n\n\n== International reactions ==\n\n\n=== Countries ===\nThe Taiwan Affairs Office of the People's Republic of China (PRC) said it was highly concerned with the earthquake and was willing to provide disaster relief assistance. In response, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council expressed thanks for its concern but said that there would be no request for assistance from Taiwan. Lai Ching-te, however, wrote to Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida on X, \"Let us continue to help each other and join hands to overcome these difficult times\". This is the second instance of Taipei rebuffing China's aid; after the 2018 Hualien earthquake, it turned down a $3 million donation from the PRC as well as its offer of search and rescue workers, but later accepted assistance from other countries. On 4 April, the Taiwanese foreign ministry condemned the PRC for its \"shameless use of the Taiwan earthquake to conduct cognitive operations internationally\" after Geng Shuang, China's deputy ambassador to the United Nations, said China is \"ready to provide disaster relief\" and thanked \"the international community for their care and good wishes\" at a UN meeting. The ministry also criticized Bolivia for expressing solidarity with China over the earthquake.\nJapan deployed military aircraft to observe possible damage in Okinawa Prefecture following the tsunami alert. The Japanese government later announced that no damage had occurred. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida expressed condolences and sympathy with Taiwan and offered the government's support, with Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa announcing a donation of $1 million that was turned over on 10 April.

        "content": "Shimon Farkas  is a cantor, singer, and performer born in Hungary, and living in Australia. He was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in 2008. He has served as Chief Cantor at The Central Synagogue of Sydney for over five decades, from 1971 to the present (with a ten-year hiatus).\n\n\n== Early life ==\nFarkas was born in Fehergyarmat, Hungary in 1949 to Holocaust survivors, Chaim Meir Farkas and Faigu Weiss. During the war, his parents survived the camps and married in Fehergyarmat after their liberation. Three of his grandparents were murdered in Auschwitz in 1944, and the fourth died prior to the war. His father was one of 5 of 8 siblings who survived the Holocaust. On his mother's side, both parents, and their three children perished in Auschwitz. Farkas moved to Israel in 1951, and led a service on Friday evening at the Rama Synagogue in Tel Aviv at age 9.\nFarkas and his mother immigrated to the United States in the fall of 1961, after his father's death. They lived in the Borough Park neighbourhood of Brooklyn, New York. For his musical training, he studied privately under world-renowned Cantor Moshe Kusevitsky and was appointed lead soloist in Kusevitsky's choir. Kusevitsky was cantor at Temple Beth El of Borough Park which later merged into Young Israel Beth El of Borough Park.\n\n\n== Cantorial career ==\nFarkas was first posted as cantor at the Orthodox Shaarei Shomayim synagogue in 1967 for the High Holidays in Windsor, Ontario.\nFarkas led High Holiday services for an Orthodox congregation in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1969 and 1970. During that time, while attending Yeshiva University in New York, he enrolled as an exchange student at Bar Iian University in Israel where he studied under Cantor David Bagley. In Israel, he met Veronica Weisz, who was studying at Machon Gold in Jerusalem. The two were married and relocated to her hometown in Sydney, Australia.\nThe following year at age 22, he was appointed and served as cantor at The Central Synagogue of Sydney for 15 years. In 1987, he was engaged by the Concord Resort Hotel in the Catskills (NY), to conduct Passover and High Holyday services, where it was noted that he filled the venue to capacity.\nAfter the success of his performances at the Concord during each Passover and High Holidays, Farkas recorded an album called \"Voices of the Concord\" accompanied by the Concord Symphonic Chorale, making his debut as a composer. Writing for The Australian Jewish News, David Brown reviewed the album and wrote \"In a world where the art of the cantor is hardly flourishing, Farkas keeps the cantorial flag flying proudly. He also makes his debut here as a composer of some distinction in a beautifully sculptured Hin’ni, always one of his best pieces; his intimate communing with the Almighty here is a tour de force, and no less so is Hashkivenu, also a Farkas composition. The touch of baritonal and moving parts of the Yamim Noraim has always been the Un’saneh Tokef. Here in a difficult but totally cohesive arrangement by Naftali Herstik and Raymond Goldstein Farkas shows off, as he does throughout, his impeccable chazanut and mellow timbre. The touch of baritonal core makes his voice especially attractive.\" A record of the songs from \"Voices of the Concord\" are kept at the Dartmouth Jewish Sound Archive.\nIn 1994, the synagogue in Sydney was damaged by fire. Farkas played a role in fundraising for the rebuilding of the synagogue and returned to his current position as Chief Cantor, when the Central Synagogue was rededicated in 1998.\nFarkas continues to perform and has built up a notable repertoire over the course of his career, singing in seven languages, and including Broadway favorites. He performs primarily between the United States, Israel, Europe and Australia. He has appeared with Marvin Hamlisch, conducting the Calgary Symphony Orchestra and the Sydney International Orchestra when Farkas produced a concert in 2008, titled \"From Broadway to Jerusalem\" at the same synagogue where he served as cantor for decades, The Central Synagogue of Sydney. In the following years, Farkas and his son, Dov produced a series of gala concerts in Melbourne and Sydney called \"Symphony for the Soul: A Salute to Israel,\" with Dr. Mordechai Sobol as conductor.\n\n\n== Music In The Family ==\nShimon and Veronica have three children, Chaim, Mimi, and Dov. both sons have followed in their father's footsteps with notable performances and recordings with their father and on their own.\nDov Farkas has an extensive experience in serving as a Cantor for various Synagogues in Australia. He started his journey as a Cantor at the South Head Synagogue in Sydney and served there for eight years. Later, he moved to the Chabad House of Caulfield - 770 in Melbourne and served as a Cantor for five years. In 2008, he was appointed as the Chief Cantor of the Caulfield Hebrew Congregation, one of the largest Synagogues in Australia based in Melbourne.\nChaim Farkas is President of the congregation Ichud Shivat Tzion, in Tel Aviv, Israel, where he also leads services. The congregation has a significant history as the primary center for German Jewish survivors in the city. In recent years, the synagogue faced a decline in membership and attendance. However, Chaim Farkas's efforts have helped revitalize the synagogue. The synagogue follows modern orthodox practices and aims to foster a unique relationship between the religious and secular worlds in Tel Aviv.\nFarkas's granddaughter, Eden Shifroni, a soprano, has completed her Bachelor of Music (Classical Performance) and Master of Music Studies (Opera Performance) from the Sydney Conservatorium of Music. Noted as an emerging talent, Eden spoke about growing up, \"watching her grandfather Shimon Farkas sing as the chazzan at Sydney’s Central Synagogue,\" she told The AJN. “I definitely think my passion for music was ignited at a very young age.” Like her grandfather, Shifroni performs in multiple languages, and mentions that she connects to her heritage everywhere she performs.\n\n\n== Participation In The March of the Living ==\n\nFarkas has participated numerous times in the March of the Living in Auschwitz-Birkenau on Holocaust Remembrance Day. At the March of the Living, he chanted the El Malei Rachamim, the traditional Jewish memorial prayer, for the six million Jews who perished in the Holocaust. With his two sons, Dov & Chaim, they performed Szól a Kakas Már, a Hungarian Jewish folk song composed by the Rabbi of Kalev (1751– 1821), expressing a deep yearning for the redemption of the Jewish people and their return to the land of Israel.  Farkas has contributed significantly to the International March of the Living by raising funds to support more student participation. One member of the Australian delegation commented that \"Shimon is perhaps the only human being who has the capability to convey and transmit the suffering of our people in the middle of the 20th century in an all-but-experiential manner.\"\nAttending with the Australian delegation, was Frank Lowy, Holocaust survivor and philanthropist, and friend of Shimon Farkas, who witnessed the Farkas family performance in 2013. At the ceremony, Lowy spoke about the circumstances of his father, Hugo Lowy's murder in Auschwitz. Shimon Farkas also sang at the 2014 March of the Living bringing with him Leonardo Farkas who has since become a major benefactor of the March of the Living.\n\nBefore attending the 2024 March of the Living in Poland, Cantor Farkas and his family will attend a special March in Budapest, Hungary, commemorating 80 years since the destruction of Hungarian Jewry in the spring of 1944 during the Holocaust.\nCantor Farkas and his two sons will be leading the program in Budapest. \"We will sing Jewish melodies in the very places where so many of our beloved ancestors – including three of my grandparents – were sent to their deaths 80 years ago\", said Farkas. \"And our message will be loud and clear: Hitler, you did not win, and you will never win! Am Yisrael Chai (The People of Israel Live!)\"'\n\n\n== See also ==\n2008 Australia Day Honours\nMarch of the Living\n\n\n== References ==",
