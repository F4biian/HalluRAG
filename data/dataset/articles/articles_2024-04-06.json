        "content": "The consumption of tea in France dates back to the seventeenth century, and has been growing slowly ever since. The market is highly fragmented, with upmarket tea brands building up an image of \"French tea\" that is easily exported.\nTea arrived in France during the reign of Louis XIII, at the same time as other luxury colonial products, chocolate, and coffee, and gained in popularity with the arrival of Jules Mazarin at court, who attributed medicinal virtues to tea. The price was high, however, and tea was reserved for the aristocracy, who were not content just to drink it: it was also used as a smoking plant, salad herb, or ointment ingredient. The use of milk in tea developed at the French court, as the hot liquid could damage porcelain cups. During the French Revolution, tea was seen as a luxury product and its consumption was discouraged. Under the Second Empire, Anglomania gave a new lease of life to tea consumption, and Empress Eugenie opened a private tea room inspired by the literary salons of the previous century. Other French tea rooms, open to the public, appeared at the same time, including Ladurée. Tea began to be consumed throughout France but was still reserved for the notables. In the 19th century, the working classes took up the habit of boiling water to protect themselves against cholera epidemics and became accustomed to tea competing with coffee. The end of the 19th century was marked by the Japanese movement and the fascination of Parisian cultural elites with the Far East, which gave tea a new lease of life. Black tea dominated French consumption until the 1970s before fragrant teas took over until the beginning of the 21st century, when the trend was to return to green tea, seen as natural and healthy.\nTea production in the 19th century was colonial, mainly in Indochina. An attempt at acclimatization in French Guiana was unsuccessful. Attempts were made to produce tea in France during the century, but specimens remained confined to botanical gardens. An attempt to produce tea on Reunion Island was abandoned in 1972 and not resumed until the beginning of the 21st century, while local experiments were organized in Brittany and Nantes. While French production remains anecdotal, French tea houses enjoy a good reputation. Several major brands, such as Kusmi Tea, Mariage Frères and Dammann Frères, process tea in France, before shipping it to Europe or Japan.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Aristocratic period: from the 17th century to the French Revolution ===\n\nTea has been consumed in France since the reign of Louis XIII, on par with other colonial luxury products such as chocolate and coffee. Sources differ as to its precise introduction: either via the Dutch, who received their first shipment of tea in Amsterdam in 1610 and then redistributed it in Europe, or directly by the Jesuits, notably Alexandre de Rhodes, a missionary sent to China from 1618 to 1653. Jules Mazarin's arrival at court increased tea's popularity among the aristocracy: tea was thought to have cured his gout, and French medical treatises of the seventeenth century constantly extolled the merits of tea. However, due to its high price, doctors looked for alternatives among European plants, such as sage or veronica officinalis. In the 17th century, the use of tea in France was not limited to drinking. It was also consumed as a smoking plant, salad herb, or used in onguent.\nIt was at the French court that the custom of adding milk to tea was first established: pouring a few cold drops into the porcelain cup beforehand protects the object from the thermal shock of pouring hot tea.\n\nTea was imported from China via Holland until 1700, which marked the return of the ship L'Amphitrite from China and the start of direct imports. In Lettres édifiantes et curieuses, the Jesuits report that they sought to directly develop the tea trade between China and France, notably through the establishment of trading posts in Canton, but that this operation collapsed in the 18th century due to the hostility of the Chinese towards them. Meanwhile, French imports of Chinese tea, via the port of Lorient, reached 1,000 tons in 1766 and increased 400-fold between 1693 and 1785. During the Regency and the reign of Louis XV, the consumption of chocolate (claimed to be an aphrodisiac) and coffee (due to the literary cafés) increased in France more than that of tea. Queen Marie Leszczynska received a Japanese porcelain and French gold set containing tea, chocolate and coffee for the birth of the Dauphin, now kept in the Louvre. Tea was more popular at the court of the Duchy of Lorraine, where Stanislas Leszczynski's physician recommended tea to him and where Turkish and Chinese exoticism was in fashion. Stanislas's confectioner, Joseph Gilliers, recommended choosing leaves that had \"a violet taste and smell\", boiling them for 15 minutes in water, possibly enriched with two slices of lemon, and drinking the mixture with a sugar loaf.\nDuring the French Revolution, tea, synonymous with luxury and the gulf separating the upper classes from the rest of society, was decried and its consumption discouraged.\n\n\n=== Rediscovery: Anglomania, Japonism, colonial and popular consumption ===\n\nIn the 19th century, and more particularly during the Second Empire, Anglomania gave a new lease of life to the consumption of Tea. The Empress Eugénie de Montijo's private tea room provided an opportunity to bring together the intellectuals of the day (Gustave Flaubert, Alexandre Dumas, Théophile Gautier, Auguste Delacroix, Gustave Doré, Louis Pasteur... ), in the manner of the literary salons of the previous century; it thus served to anchor a filiation between the Second Empire and the French monarchy, this filiation being reaffirmed in the revival of the aesthetic of Marie-Antoinette of Austria and enriched by an assumed celebration of colonial riches.\nOther French-style tearooms, open to the public, appeared in Paris. These included Ladurée, where tea, other non-alcoholic beverages, and pastries were served to a predominantly female clientele. These tea rooms enabled well-to-do women to get out of the house without having to frequent the socially disreputable cafés and bistros of the time. This service was later extended to the grand palaces of Paris but remained confined to provincial notables and the capital's bourgeois arrondissements: 7th, 8th, and 16th. Tea was also consumed by the wealthy in Biarritz and on the Mediterranean Riviera, and was reserved for medical use in other social classes. The spread of tea to the less affluent classes was very slow, driven in part by the need to boil water before consumption to protect against the cholera epidemic that raged throughout the 19th century but slowed by competition from coffee, which was abundantly produced in the French colonies.\nFrance wanted to develop tea production in its colonies, particularly in Indochina, to meet the needs of three categories of consumers: those in Indochina, who imported their tea from China; those in North Africa, who imported English green tea; and finally, those in mainland France, who imported British black tea. For the French, local production was of very poor quality, and it seemed necessary to establish new plantations run by colonists.\nAn attempt to grow tea in French Guiana, an underdeveloped colony where colonists saw their enrichment diminish with the banning of the slave trade in 1815, failed miserably: around 30 Chinese and Malays, drawn from the Manila community, were hired and settled in 1820 in a dwelling on the Kaw marshes. However, the project had not been properly planned, as the question of whether the site was suitable for growing tea had not been asked, while the workers were installed in poor conditions and subjected to ill treatment. The majority died of disease in this unhealthy environment, with four survivors being brought back to Asia in 1835.\nIn the 19th century, tea imports to France fluctuated sharply: 150 tons in 1829, 46 tons in 1830, 87 tons in 1831, and 231 tons in 1842. The method of preparing tea evolved: first, the crockery, teapot, and cup were heated with boiling water, then 4 grams of tea per guest were poured into the teapot, which was covered entirely with boiling water and left to infuse for 6 to 8 minutes; water was then added to make enough for all guests, and sugar, tea and two spoonfuls of cream were poured into each cup. Metal teapots, especially silver ones, were considered better than porcelain ones due to their thermal conductivity, and it was recommended to store tea in tin or lead tins. Attempts were made to produce tea in France during the 19th century, but specimens remained confined to botanical gardens, in part those of the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle and the Orangerie du Luxembourg.m 5.\nThe end of the 19th century was marked by the Japanese movement and the fascination of Parisian cultural elites with the Far East, as exemplified by their frequentation of the Porte chinoise, a tea and furniture store frequented by Zola, Baudelaire, Champfleury, Cernushi, Manet, Degas, Monet and Fantin-Latour.\n\nThe 1900 Universal Exhibition was an opportunity for France to discover Ceylon tea, which took on an image of exoticism and quality. At the beginning of the 20th century, tea was above all a pretext for social and social gatherings, and tea-dancing parties became increasingly popular. \nIn 1925, four-fifths of tea consumption in the French colonial empire was in North Africa, in the form of green tea; these 5,000 tonnes came mainly from imports, with French Indochina producing barely 500 tonnes of tea. At the end of the 1930s, numbers were relatively similar, with Indochina producing around 550 tonnes, France 1,350 tonnes, Tunisia 2,093 tonnes and Algeria 1,569 tonnes. Tea not produced in Indochina was imported from China and India.  Consumption changed little until the mid-1950s (1,614 tons in France, 2,482 in Tunisia), except in Algeria, where it more than doubled to 3,846 tons in 1956.\nWhen France was occupied by Germany during the Second World War, the population was hit by numerous shortages, particularly of tea. The Vichy regime claimed that these shortages were due to the blockade, but the fact that metropolitan agricultural products, such as pigs, were also in short supply led the French population to believe that it was the German occupiers who were appropriating resources. The tea shortage eases with the Churchill-Weygand agreements, under which it is decided that England will resupply North Africa with tea. An attempt to produce tea on Reunion Island was abandoned in 1972, only to be resumed at the beginning of the 21st century.  \n\n\n=== Third wind: \"French tea\", gastronomic approach, diversification ===\nBlack tea dominated French consumption until the 1970s, then flavored teas became the most popular until the beginning of the 21st century when the trend was to return to green tea, seen as natural and healthy.\nThe 1980s marked a turning point for French tea, with Mariage Frères implementing a marketing strategy based on the image of French luxury, and the founding of Palais des thés, a company more focused on travel and cultural discovery. These initiatives were reinforced by a major investment in advertising by the major tea brands in the 1990s.\nTea consumption rose sharply at the turn of the 21st century, doubling from 1995 to 2005 and tripling from 1995 to 2015.Consumption is shifting more and more towards the major tea houses, as opposed to private labels, which are growing by 10% a year and remain in the majority. This growth is accompanied by a democratization of tea-shop attendance. \n\n\n== Consumption ==\n\nIn 2022, average tea consumption in France was 250g per person per year, compared with three kilos in Ireland or England. In 2015, France ranked 30th in the world in terms of consumption, with an average of 230 grams per person per year. In 2005, the market was worth 500 million euros with a wealthy clientele willing to pay more for a quality product. Compared with other European countries, such as Germany, the market's weakness can be explained by the fact that, in 2005, barely two out of three French people consumed tea (compared with one out of two at the end of the 1990s). The market, though highly fragmented, is strongly dominated by brands sold in supermarkets: Lipton accounts for half of sales by volume, followed by Twinings. Tea houses, taken together, account for just 20% of the market. Organic tea is on the rise, accounting for 7% of green tea sales in 2017.\nDespite the country's general interest in fair trade, there is little evidence of this in the tea market. When Unilever wanted to communicate the Rainforest Alliance certification of its tea, it realized that tea tins bearing this visible certification sold less than conventional tins. However, in the iced tea market, the May Tea brand has chosen to emphasize this certification. François-Xavier Delmas, founder of Palais des thés, confirms this lack of interest by not selling fair trade certified tea, and is also critical, explaining that certification can be a way for tea producers to increase their prices without the taste quality of their products following suit. \n\n\n=== Modes of consumption ===\n\nThe French generally drink hot tea at breakfast or in the afternoon. During the Restoration period, upper-class Frenchmen had lunch around 11 a.m. and dinner at 6 p.m., and tea was then taken around 11 p.m. with light pastries, usually after the theater. With the shift of dinner later in the evening, tea was consumed around 5 p.m., in the English fashion, with more substantial snacks.\nMost people add sugar to their tea (65%), lemon (30%), milk (25%), or nothing (32%). Half the tea consumed in France in 2011 was black tea. A classic evolutionary profile for French tea consumers is to start with flavored teas and then move on to plain teas. \nIn French gastronomy, tea is increasingly a means of offering a refined, alcohol-free alternative to wine at lunchtime. In bars and restaurants, Lipton is the brand almost systematically served, due to its very affordable price and low customer demand; only bars and cafés specifically seeking to serve good tea offer alternatives: Palais des thés, Kusmi Tea or Mariage Frères.p 7. In addition to the price and quality of the tea, restaurateurs prefer suppliers who offer teas in bags, to avoid theft of infusers, and those who can provide crockery, such as teapots.\nUnlike Russian or Chinese consumers, French consumers generally don't infuse the same tea leaf several times, no doubt because of a cultural attachment to constant taste, and also so that the harmony with foodstuffs doesn't change.\nSince the 1980s, the French have consumed Christmas tea, which is generally flavored with spices, dried fruit, and candied fruit, and available in many variations depending on the brand. These teas are notably sold hot and prepared at Christmas markets, as an alternative to mulled wine.\n\nConsumption of iced tea rose sharply in France in the late 2010s, as customers turned away from soft drinks, which were perceived as too sweet. These iced teas are either prepared from loose tea and designed to be drunk hot, or from loose blends designed specifically to be drunk iced, or bought ready-made in bottles; the latter generally have low sugar content to escape the tax on sugary drinks. For ready-to-drink beverages, Lipton largely dominated the market in 2019, with nearly half of sales for ice tea, followed by private labels (23%), May Tea (Suntory group, 12%) and Fuze Tea (Coca-Cola group, 7%). In 2016, the market penetration rate for iced tea bottles reached 42% in France, up 4.6 points on the previous year. Since the late 2010s, more recently than other Western (1990-2000s) and Asian (1970-1980s) countries, France has consumed bubble tea. This late arrival stems from the fact that bubble tea is commonly sold as a street food, to be consumed quickly while walking, while French consumers remain on average more attached to long, sit-down meals than the rest of the Western world.\n\n\n=== Tea and cooking ===\nThe first documented use of tea in cooking is a recipe for tea cream by La Chapelle, published in Le Cuisinier moderne in 1742; this recipe remained the only use of tea in French cuisine until the 19th century, before the development, as in other countries, of sweet recipes based on tea: financier, cakes, crème brûlée or madeleines. In France, savory haute cuisine incorporating tea was also developing, as was a whole culture of the best pairings between tea and food, particularly tea and cheese. Mariage Frères offers a wide range of tea-based dishes in its salons, both savory and sweet: marinades, vinaigrettes and sauces accompany fish and meat dishes.\n\n\n== Commerce ==\n\n\n=== Brands ===\n\nThe main French tea brands fall into three categories. Historically French importers of colonial products, founded in the 19th century and generally importing products other than tea, such as Compagnie Coloniale, Mariage Frères, Olivier-Langlois, and Thé Éléphant. The importers were founded by foreigners (British with George Cannon, Dutch-British with Betjeman & Barton, Dutch with Dammann Frères, Russian with Kusmi Tea) then set up in France, and dating from the same period. Last but not least, there are the new players who appeared at the end of the 20th century, bringing their vision to the table, such as Palais des thés, with its \"globe-trotting approach\", the SCOP-TI cooperative created from the takeover of the Elephant tea factory, or Les Jardins de Gaïa, specializing in bio tea. Many other companies exist, but most are mainly available in Paris.\n\n\n=== Imports ===\nWhile several tea houses, such as Palais des thés and Jardins de Gaïa, import tea directly from producing countries, the majority of tea imported into France comes from Germany, with the leaves transiting via Hamburg, where companies flavor them for resale. In 2010, France imported over 19,000 tonnes of tea. These imports are facilitated by European Union trade rules, which impose no customs duties on tea. In 2016, France was the world's 10th largest importer of tea, accounting for 2.6% of tonnages traded, worth US$161 million.\n\n\n=== Export ===\nSeveral major brands, such as Kusmi Tea, Mariage Frères, or Dammann Frères, process tea in France, before shipping it to Europe or Japan; these exports account for between 30% and 40% of their sales.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Plantations ===\nIn the seventeenth century, Jesuit Jean-Baptiste Labat tried to introduce tea to Martinique using seeds from China; when the trees grew, he realized that they were in fact Camellia sasanqua, not Camellia sinensis.\nSeveral other attempts to produce tea took place on Reunion Island, more precisely at Grand Coude, on a volcanic plateau at an altitude of 1,100 m; production covered almost 350 hectares in the 1960s, only to be abandoned in 1972. The plantation was revived at the beginning of the 21st century: the old tea bushes, now several meters high and therefore unsuitable for picking, were transformed into a tourist attraction. Other gardens were opened, in a mixed plantation with tobacco to protect the tea bushes from the sun and combat insects, and pumpkins to cover the soil. Their production, of green tea, white tea, flavored tea (cinnamon, lemongrass, and home-grown geranium), and tea-derived products, reached 53 tons for 587 hectares cultivated in 2017.\nIn Nantes, a small-scale tea production has existed since 2002, with a club of amateurs cultivating around a hundred tea bushes received as a gift from Suncheon, a city twinned with Nantes. It produced 900g of fresh leaves in 2011, which were then converted into 300g of green tea. The tea harvest is the occasion for a festival open to the public. Several attempts at tea production are also taking place in Brittany, a region that is sufficiently humid, sunny, and protected from frost to consider growing tea plants. First sales are scheduled for 2020. In Alès, Gard, the Parc Floral de la Prairie produced 2,000 tea bushes in 2006. Other gardens also exist in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n=== Tea transformation ===\n\nThe operations carried out in France include the manufacture of loose tea packaging (metal tins or bags), the blending of teas from different origins, and the flavoring of the leaves. While the latter is generally done by spraying with essential oil, Compagnie Coloniale's flavoring is done by steam. French tea houses were particularly inventive when it came to flavors and fragrances, and their creations were often subsequently adopted by British brands.\nIn 2010, Unilever decided to relocate its Éléphant brand tea bag factory from Gémenos to Poland. Production was indeed transferred, but the emblematic social conflict dragged on, and the employees succeeded in taking over the factory, founding the cooperative Scop-TI and the brand 1336, named after the 1,336 days of social conflict, as a means of distributing their production. All in all, tea employs few people in France: Pagès, the leading private-label tea brand, employs around 100 people, while Kusmi Tea employs around 500, divided between boutiques and the production plant in Le Havre. Unlike Unilever, Kusmi Tea has chosen to relocate its production (tea and tins) to France, after having previously done so in Morocco: the chairman explains this change of heart by the rising cost of labor worldwide, which is catching up with that of France, the rising cost of oil, greater logistical flexibility induced by the presence of production plants directly in the sales territory, and lastly investments in automation made possible by the CICE.\n\n\n=== Utensils ===\nIn the 18th century, the growing consumption of tea by the aristocracy led the Vincennes and then Sèvres porcelain factories to produce high-quality porcelain for this purpose, after an initial period during which Chinese products were used. This tableware was not specific to tea, as it was also used for the other exotic beverages gaining in popularity during this period, coffee and chocolate, including teapots that could be used to prepare and serve coffee. This production continued into the 18th and 20th centuries. However, the invention of fine earthenware in England in the mid-seventeenth century and Anglomania meant that the French market was dominated by British imports. In the 19th century, the continental blockade and technological innovations making it possible to produce rococo-style earthenware from Terre de Lorraine boosted French production, leading to the establishment of new factories in Apt, Bordeaux, Calais, Chantilly, Choisy-le-Roi, Creil, Douai, Forges-les-Eaux, Gien, Le Havre, Longwy, Orléans, Sarreguemines and Val-sous-Meudon.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe twentieth century saw the creation of a style known as \"métissage anglais\", based on English silver-plated teapots but produced in tinted bisque porcelain. Also in the 20th century, Mariage Frères collaborated with prominent artists: Wilhelm Wagenfeld designed a tea service in the 1930s, heralding the era of industrial design in teaware; later, Le Corbusier designed a teapot in the functionalist style.\n\n\n== Tea in French culture ==\n\nIn Marcel Proust's novel Du côté de chez Swann, the narrator relives his childhood over a madeleine dipped in tea:\"...all the flowers in our garden and those in Mr. Swann's park, and the water lilies in the Vivonne, and the good people of the village and their little dwellings and the church and all Combray and its surroundings, all that which takes shape and solidity, has come out, town and gardens, from my cup of tea.\"So famous is this passage that it coined Proust's expression madeleine to refer to the phenomenon of reminiscence induced by a scent. It also contributed to the lasting association in the French mind of tea and the bourgeois and aristocratic strata of society. \nAnother interpretation of tea in À la recherche du temps perdu is offered by the academic Jarrod Hayes: pointing out that the vocabulary of tea was widely used in Proust's time as a euphemism for homosexual relations between men (\"tasse\" and \"tasse à thé\" could refer to pissotières, \"théière\" and \"tearoom\" specifically to those where homosexuals meet to have sex, which are referred to as \"prendre le thé\"), he proposes a symbolic reading of many passages in the novel as evocative of Baron de Charlus's homosexuality.\n\nIn French pictorial culture, tea fulfills three functions. Firstly, it can serve as an accessory to orientalism, first in the 17th century as turquerie, and then from the 19th century onwards, inspired by North Africa; in this case, French fantasies are represented rather than a real vision of these regions.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIt can also be used to depict the gentleness of life, in the shade of gardens or indoors. Finally, tea and its accessories can enrich and renew the subjects depicted in still lifes.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, mint tea was used by artists to talk about the descendants of immigrants in France. This is the case, for example, in French cinema, with Abdelkrim Bahloul's Le Thé à la menthe (1984) and Mehdi Charef's Le Thé au harem d'Archimède (1985), both about the second generation of immigrants who want to stay in France. This is also the case, almost thirty years later, with hip-hop artists, as in Josman's Un zder un thé or La Caution's Thé à la menthe: \"Première époque bidonville, ambiance clandestine. In a bar in Barbès, mint tea, couscous and tajine on the menu. With a bad accent, no salamalecs,\" says Hassan the athlete from Algeria, from Hollywood to Tamanrasset. No more mint tea, just bitter palaver\".\n\n\n=== French relationship with tea ===\n\nOne explanation put forward for the low popularity of tea in France in the 1990s is a problem of representation: the French mistakenly believed that tea is limited to the low-quality teabags served in cafés and hotels at a modest cost and that it is necessarily full-bodied, whereas these are only the teas consumed in England, and therefore do not correspond to the French market. The growing interest in Chinese and Japanese civilizations in France at the turn of the 21st century, which accompanied the increase in tea sales, proved him right. This interest also stemmed from the falling cost of long-haul flights at the beginning of the 21st century, which enabled more French people to travel and discover cultures where tea is central. This French interest can be seen in the exhibitions Le Thé - Histoires d'une boisson millénaire at the Musée national des Arts asiatiques - Guimet in 2013 and Thé, café ou chocolat? L'essor des boissons exotiques au xviiie siècle in 2015 at the Musée Cognacq-Jay or by the foundation of tea schools, one oriented towards popularization and founded in 1999 by the Palais des thés, the other towards gastronomy and created 10 years later by the Institut Paul Bocuse.\nDespite this renewed interest, the French still lag behind other cultures where tea is ubiquitous in their ability to distinguish between different teas, with a 2013 study showing that they are on average less able than Koreans to distinguish between two green teas.\nThe French vocabulary of tea tasting borrows heavily from enology: terroir, techniques, geography, chemistry, but also the subjectivity of tasting, the description of the tea liquor, whose color is described in the same way as a wine's dress, fragrances, astringency and harvesting method; the impatience surrounding the first spring harvests in Darjeeling is reminiscent of the celebration of the grape harvest and Beaujolais nouveau. But it's also a terrain for escapism and poetic evocation, in keeping with French table culture, where we eat, talk, and talk about what we eat. \nFor Kitti Cha Sangmanee of Mariage Frères, what characterizes French tea is a quest for flavor diversity, a blend of respect for taste standards, and a taste for novelty. He also likens the French relationship with tea to that of Paris about cuisine: products may not be grown locally, but it is a nerve center to which foodstuffs converge to be magnified and appreciated. Tastes for aromas evolve: red fruits and vanilla give way to citrus, spices, and turmeric, while rose and jasmine remain classics.\n\n\n=== Image of French tea in foreign cultures ===\n\nThe overall image of France is that of a country of gastronomy, coffee and wine, but this vision is rapidly changing with the export of French teas and tourist visits to France.\nFrench tea houses work hard to create the image of \"French tea\", associated with luxury and sophistication, in the image of French perfumery or haute couture. This enables them to export their products to tea-loving nations such as England and Japan.\nFor the British, the French taste for tea is more refined, more delicate than that of the English, and therefore closer to the expectations of Japanese tourists visiting Paris. For them, the French approach to tea is similar to that of French wine, where the product is linked to a history, a culture, and a terroir; this connoisseur-gourmet attitude can veer into snobbery. On the other hand, this is a model for Argentinian tea producers, who are developing tea schools in their countries to increase the market for high-quality tea on their own.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTea\nBlack tea\nHerbal tea\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nPettigrew, Jane (2018).

        "content": "Bakti (English: Faithfullness) is 1950 Singaporean Malay-language black-and-white drama film directed and written by L. Krishnan and produced by Run Run Shaw. It was adapted by S. Ramanathan from Les Misérables. Music and songs were composed by Osman Ahmad. It starred P. Ramlee in his first leading role, Kasma Booty, S. Roomai Noor, and Siput Sarawak. The film launched Ramlee's career and imposed him as a leading figure in the Malay film industry for the following 20 years.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nA wealthy man, Ibrahim, adopts an impoverished orphan, Nasir. Ibrahim’s spoilt biological son Hassan objects, while the latter's daughter Sa’adiyah allies herself with the newcomer. After marrying a wife consumed by greed, Hassan turns to thieving to support their lifestyle. He is caught and imprisoned; upon his release, he steals from his adopted brother Nasir. However, Nasir saves him from the arm of the law by informing the police that the stolen items are actually gifts he planned to give Hassan. Hassan is thus released and comes to realise Nasir’s noble heart and kind intentions.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nBakti was directed and written by L. Krishnan in his directorial debut, and was produced by Run Run Shaw for Shaw Brothers Studio and Malay Film Productions. It was adapted from Les Misérables with an original script by S. Ramanathan. The film starred P. Ramlee, Kasma Booty, S. Roomai Noor, and Siput Sarawak in a leading role. It featured Yusof Banjar and Siti Zainab in a supporting role. The music and songs in the films, such as \"Hidup Berdua\", \"Merpati Dua Sejoli\", \"Hidup Melarat\", \"Taman Puspawarna\", \"Sate\", and \"Sedang Bergaya\" were composed and written by Osman Ahmad, who then released it into an album.\nRamlee was cast by Krishnan in a leading role as Nasir after the latter saw the first's performance as a singing voice and bit parts in previous films. In the films, he sung five songs along with Nona Asiah and Momo Latiff. Kasma Booty was initially reluctant to act alongside Ramlee who was then an unknown. However, after Krishnan convinced her, she agreed and appreciated how successful the film was because of Ramlee.\n\n\n== Release and reception ==\nBakti was released on 1 April 1950 and remained at one of Shaw’s \"Rex\" cinemas until 14 April. The film later was screened in other cinemas in Malaysia, such as Lido in Penang, in May 1950, and the Atlantic in Johor Bahru between June and July in the same year. It received a positive response, and was described as “skilfully directed and beautifully photographed”. It  was also praised for its clear storyline, to the point that some commentators indicated that even those who could not understand Malay did not have trouble following the plot. The performance of the experinced and new comer child actors were also highly praised.\nAfter this film, P. Ramlee became a prominent figure in Malay film industry, while Shaw Brothers Studio hired more Indian directors with B. S. Rajhans being the most influential figure in the early development of Malay films.\n\n\n== Legacy and status ==\nP. Ramlee gave his character's name to his son, Nasir P. Ramlee. \nWith no known surviving copy, Bakti is now considered a lost film.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Works cited ===\nFu, Poshek (2008). China Forever: The Shaw Brothers and Diasporic Cinema.

        "content": "The Prague slave trade refers to the slave trade conducted between the Duchy of Bohemia and the Caliphate of Córdoba in Moorish al-Andalus in the early Middle Ages. The Duchy's capital of Prague was the center of this slave trade, and internationally known as one of the biggest centers of slave trade in Europe at the time. \nThe Prague slave trade is known as one of the main routes of saqaliba-slaves to the Muslim world, alongside the Balkan slave trade by the Republic of Venice in the South, and Volga route of the Vikings via Rus, Volga Bulgaria and the Samanid Bukhara slave trade in the East. \nThe Duchy of Bohemia was a new state in Christian Europe at this time, bordering to lands of Pagan Slavs to the North and East. Pagans were considered as legitimate targets of enslavement both by Christian and Islamic law. Bohemia was thereby able to traffick Pagan captives to the the slave market of the Muslim Caliphate of Cordoba through Christian France without trouble. The Prague slave trade was a mutual trade of benefit between the Caliphate of Córdoba, who were dependent on slaves to managed their state bureaucracy and military, and the Duchy of Bohemia, whose new state rose to economic prominence due to the trade. \nThe Prague slave trade was dependent upon supply of Pagan captives to maintain the slave trade with Muslim al-Andalus via Christian Europe, and therefore lost its supply source when Eastern Europe started to adopt Christianity. In parallel, in the early 11th-century both the Caliphate of Cordoba as well as the Duchy of Bohemia went through a period of political instability. \n\n\n== Background ==\nIn Western Europe, a major slave trade route went from Prague in Central Europe via France to Moorish Al-Andalus, which was both a destination for the slaves as well as center of slave trade to the rest of the Muslim world in the Middle East.\nPrague in the Duchy of Bohemia, which was a recently Christianized state in the early 10th-century, became a major center of the European slave trade in between the 9th- and the 11th-century.\nThe revenue from the Prague slave trade has been named as one of the economic foundations of the Bohemian state, financing the armies necessary to form a centralized state, which was not uncommon for the new Christian state in Eastern Europe.  \nThe Duchy of Bohemia was a state in a religious border zone, bordering to Pagan Slavic lands to the North, East and South East. In the Middle ages, religion was the determining factor on who was considered a legitimate target for enslavement. Christians prohibited Christians from enslaving other Christians, and Muslims prohibited Muslims from enslaving other Muslims; however both aproved of the enslavement of Pagans, who thereby became a lucrative target for slave traders.\nIn the 9th and 10th-century, the Slavs in Eastern Europe were still adherents of the Slavic religion, making them Pagans to the Christians and infidels to the Muslims, and thereby considered as legitimate targets for enslavement by both. \nBohemia, being a religious border state close to Pagan lands, were thus in an ideal position to engage in slave trade with both Christians and Muslims, having access to a close supply of Pagan captives. The slaves were aquired through slave raids toward the Pagan Slavic lands North of Prague.\nThe Pagan Slavic tribes of Central and Eastern Europe were targeted for slavery by several actors in the frequent military expeditions and raids alongside their lands.  \nDuring the military campaigns of Charlemagne and his successor in the 9th-century, Pagan Slavs were captured and sold by the Christian Franks along the Danube-Elbe rivers, and by the mid 10th-century, Prague had become a big center of the slave trade in Slavic Pagans to al-Andalus via France.\n\n\n== Supply ==\n\nPrague was known in all Europe as a major slave trade center.  Captives sold as slaves via Prague were supplied by several routes. \n\n\n=== Dukes of Bohemia ===\nThe armies of the Dukes of Bohemia captured Pagan Slavs from the East in expeditions to the lands later known as Poland to supply the slave market, which brought considerable profit to the Dukes.\nSeveral sources from the 10th-century mentioned how the Dukes were involved in supplying the Prague slave market and that the slaves normally came from lands corresponding to what later corresponded to Southern Poland and Western Ukraine. \nThe Dukes of Bohemia, particularly Boleslaus I (r. 935-972) and Boleslaus II (r. 972-999), regularly provided the Prague slave market with new Pagan captives from expeditions to the Northeast.\n\n\n=== Vikings ===\nAnother supply came from the vikings. The vikings were known to be supplyers of slaves to the Islamic market via other routes. People taken captive during the viking raids in Western Europe could be sold to Moorish Spain via the Dublin slave trade or transported via the Volga trade route to Russia, where slaves were sold to Muslim merchants in the Khazar Kaghanate, and the Volga Bulgaria and from there by caravan to Khwarazm and finnally to the Abbasid Caliphate via the Samanid slave market in Central Asia. \nWhile the slaves sold by the vikings via the Eastern route could be Christian Western Europeans, the slaves provided by the vikings to the slave route of Prague-Magdeburg-Verdun were Pagan Slavs, who in contrast to Christians were legitimate for other Christians to enslave and sell as slaves to Muslims; according to Liutprand of Cremona, these slaves were trafficked to slavery in al-Andalus via Verdun, were some of them were selected to undergo castration to become eunuchs for the Muslim slave market in al-Andalus.\n\n\n=== Poles ===\nSlaves were also provided by the Slavs themselwes as war captives during the unification of Poland under Mieszko I. To sustain this military machine and meet other state expenses, large amounts of revenue were necessary. Greater Poland had some natural resources used for trade, such as fur, hide, honey and wax, but those surely did not provide enough income. According to Ibrahim ibn Yaqub, Prague in Bohemia, a city built of stone, was the main center for the exchange of trading commodities in this part of Europe. \nFrom Kraków, the Slavic traders brought tin, salt, amber and whatever other products they had, most importantly slaves; Muslim, Jewish, Hungarian and other traders were the buyers of the Prague slave market. The Life of St. Adalbert, written at the end of the 10th century by John Canaparius, records the fate of many Christian slaves sold in Prague as the main curse of the time. Dragging of shackled slaves is shown as a scene in the bronze 12th-century Gniezno Doors. It may well be that the territorial expansion financed itself by being the source of loot, of which the captured local people were the most valuable part. The scale of the human trade practice is arguable, however, because much of the population from the defeated tribes was resettled for agricultural work or in the near-gord settlements, where they could serve the victors in various capacities and thus contribute to the economic and demographic potential of the state. Considerable increase of population density was characteristic of the newly established states in eastern and Central Europe. The slave trade not insufficient to meet all revenue needs, the Piast state had to look for other options.\nMieszko thus strove to subdue Pomerania at the Baltic coast. The area was the site of wealthy trade emporia, frequently visited by traders, especially from the east, west and north. Mieszko had every reason to believe that great profits would have resulted from his ability to control the rich seaports situated on long distance trade routes such as Wolin, Szczecin and Kołobrzeg.\n\n\n== Trade ==\n\nTraditionally, the slave traders aquiring the slaves in Prague and transporting them to the slave market of al-Andalus are said to have been dominated by the Jewish Radhanite merchants. \nPope Gelasius (492) permitted Jews to transport slaves from Gaul to Italy on the condition that they were Pagans, and by the time of Pope Gregory the Great (590-604), Jews were a dominating actor in the slave trade. \nWhile Christians were not allowed to enslave Christians and Muslims not allowed to enslave Muslims, Jewish slave traders had the advantage to move freely across religious borders, and supply Muslim slaves to the Christian world and Christian slaves to the Muslim world. as well as Pagan slaves to both.  \nThe Moorish Jewish merchant Ibrahim Ibn Jakub of Cordoba has described the trade in Slavic slaves as one of the goods exported from Prague to al-Andalus by Jewish and Muslim merchants. \nIbrahim Ibn Jakub, who likely visited Prague in 961, described how slave traders visited the Prague slave market from Krakow and Hungary to buy slaves. \nAccording to Abraham ibn Ya'ḳub, Byzantine Jews regularly bought Pagan Slavs at the Prague slave market.\nIn contrast to the viking slave trade with saqaliba slaves to the Middle East via the Khazar slave trade and the Volga Bulgarian slave trade to slavery in the Abbasid Caliphate via the Samanid slave trade in Central Asia, there are no Arab silver dirham hoards from the saqaliba slave trade in Prague, and the slave traders in Prague would have been payed by Frankish or Jewish middlemen with luxury goods. \nMarek Jankowiak argues that one payment used by Jewish merchants who bought slaves at the market in Prague in the 9th and 10th-century for the  Moorish slave market was small pieces of cloth, which were used as an exchange rate for silver. \nThe slaves were transported from Prague to Al-Andalus via France. While the church discouraged the sale of Christian slaves to Muslims, the sale of Pagans to Muslims was not met with such opposition. Louis the Fair granted his permission to Jewish merchants to traffick slaves through his Kingdom provided they were non-baptized Pagans. \nThe Prague slave trade was connected to merchants from Mainz and Verdun and other Western Frankish cities, through which the slaves were trafficked toward al-Andalus; these merchants were often but not always Jewish. \nThe Jews of Verdun are noted to have bought slaves and sold them off to al-Andalus, and many Moorish Jews profited of the slave trade.\nBoth Christians and Muslims were prohibited from performing castrations, but there was no such ban for Jews, which made it possible for them to meet the great demand for eunuchs in the Muslim world.\n\n\n== Slave market ==\n\nThe most lucrative slave market was the Islamic slavery in Al-Andalus. The Arabic Caliphate of Córdoba referred to the forrests of Central and Eastern Europe, which came to function as a slave source supply, as the Bilad as-Saqaliba (\"land of the slaves\").\nThe Prague slave market was a part of a big net of slave trade in European saqaliba slaves to the Muslim world. Ibn Hawqal wrote in the 10th-century: \n\n‘The country [of the Saqaliba] is long and wide....Half of their country...is raided by the Khurasanis [Khorezm] who take prisoners from it, while its northern half is raided by the Andalusians who buy them in Galicia, in France, in Lombardy and in Calabria so as to make them eunuchs, and thereafter they ferry them over to Egypt and Africa. All the Saqaliba eunuchs in the world come from Andalusia....They are castrated near this country. The operation is performed by Jewish merchants.'\nIn Islamic lands, the slave market had specific requirements. Female slaves were used for either domestic or sexual slavery as concubines. \nMale slaves were used for one of two categories: either for military slavery or as eunuchs. \nThe latter category of male slaves were subjected to castration for the market. Many male slaves selected to be sold as eunuchs were subjected to castration in Verdun. \nMost saqaliba slaves would have been prebubescent children when castrated. \nIn Moorish al-Andalus, European saqaliba-slaves were considered as exotic display objects with their light hair, skin and eye colors.  \nFemale saqaliba slaves were sought after as either enslaved maidservants or for sexual slavery as harem concubines.  \nMale saqaliba slaves were either castrated and sold as eunuchs, or kept intact and sold for use for military slavery as slaves soldiers; male saqaliba slaves were also used for a number of domestic and bureucratic positions. \nThe nature of the market for saqaliba slaves meant that most saqaliba slaves would have been prebubescent children when enslaved.  \nWhite European slaves were viewed as luxury goods in Al-Andalus, where they could be sold for as much as 1,000 dinars, a substantial price. \nSaqaliba slaves were viewed as luxury goods and often used as urban domestic staff and in the Royal Palace; during the reign of the Umayyad Caliphs Abd al-Rahman III (912-961) and al-Hakam II (961-976), between 3750 and 6087 saqaliba slaves were listed to have lived in the Royal Palace of Madinat al-Zahra as slave concubines or eunuchs, and hundreds of slaves are estimated to have been imported every year. \nThe slaves were not always destined for the al-Andalus market; similar to Bohemia in Europe, al-Andalus was a religious border state for the Muslim world, and saqaliba slaves were exported from there further to the Muslim world in the Middle East.\nThe Duchy of Bohemia and the Caliphate of Córdoba were both dependent on each other because of the from the slave trade; the Caliphate of Córdoba was dependent on enslaved bureaucrats and slave soldiers to build and manage their centralised state, while the new state of the Duchy of Bohemia built their economic prosperity in the profit earned by the slave trade with the Caliphate.\n\n\n== End of the slave trade ==\n\nThe saqaliba slave trade from Prague to al-Andalus via France lost its religious legitimacy when the Pagan Slavs of the North started to gradually adopt Christianity from the late 10th-century, which made them of bounds for Christian Bohemia to enslave and sell to Muslim al-Andalus.\nThe Prague slave trade were not able to legitimately supply their slave pool after the Slavs gradually adopted Christianity from the late 10th-century onward. \nChristian Europe did not aprove of Christian slaves, and as Europe adopted Christianity almost entirely by the 11th-century slavery died out in Western Europe North of the Alps in the 12th- and 13th-centuries.\nThe disintegration of the Caliphate of Córdoba in the early 11th-century, which was completed by 1031, corresponded to a period of instability in the Duchy of Bohemia in parallell with the end of the slave trade between Bohemia and the Caliphate.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSlavery in Al-Andalus\nRussian conquest of Bukhara\nSlavery in Central Asia\nCrimean slave trade\nKhivan slave trade\nTurkish slaves in the Delhi Sultanate\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Graefenberg Medical Institute, Alabama's first medical school, was built in Dadeville, Tallapoosa, Alabama. Doctor Philip Maddison Shepard opened and operated the institute starting in 1852. The naming of the school was after  Graefenberg, a Hydropathic Establishment of Vincent Priessnitz, an Austrian medical institute. [[1]]    Dr. Philip Madison Shepard advertised the future school opening in the newspapers. \nThe institute offered two sessions per year, each lasting approximately four to five months. The admission requirements were flexible, and completing just one session was sufficient for graduation. The cost of attending a session, which covered board, washing, housing, and the 'Diploma and Honor' fee, ranged from $135 to $145. The regular tuition fee was $60, but discounted rates were often available, particularly during the summer session when the cost dropped to $30 or $40. If a student failed to graduate at the end of a session, they could repeat the process by paying a library fee of $10.\nThe location of the institute was significant, as it was the first functioning medical school chartered by the Alabama legislature, impacting medical education in the region. It was located on the public road to Dudleyville, starting from HWY 280 you turn onto Lafayette Street and keep straight; the road turns to Dudleyville Road. Near the intersection of Booger Hollow Road and Dudleyville Road, the Graefenberg Medical Institute was located on both sides of the road, there was a three-story building and more for instruction, housing and storage of cadavers.  \nsuch as a library, pharmacy, anatomical laboratory, classrooms, and an auditorium.   \nThe proximity to Shepard's home, where instruction took place, facilitated a holistic educational environment.The last sesson was in 1880. \nThe school had about 50 graduates; we know at least 13 of the names of these graduates, five of whom were Dr. Shepard's children. \n\n\n== References ==\n\nBook: Elizabeth D.

He was a student of Ibn Baṣṣāl and Ibn al-Lūnquh.\nThe two works attributed to Abu ʾl-Khayr are:\n\nKitāb al-filāḥa (\"Book of Husbandry\"), a treatise on agriculture. It is found in at least three manuscripts in Paris, Rabat and Tetuan. In addition, the Arabic text has been published, as have partial French and complete Spanish translations.\nUmdat al-ṭabīb fī ma‘rifat al-nabāt li-kull labīb (\"The Physician's Reliance in the Knowledge of Plants for Every Man of Understanding\"), an encyclopedia of botanical knowledge.

In 1870, the family moved to Williamson County to begin ranching. In 1879, he joined in a buffalo hunt in the Llano Estacado. Afterwards, he worked as a cowboy.In 1886, John and Dudley Snyder hired Norfleet to drive 5,000 cattle from Central Texas to the High Plains. He worked for the Snyder brothers until 1889, when Isaac L. Ellwood hired him as a foreman for Spade Ranch. On June 23, 1894, he married Mattie Eliza Hudgins, and they had 4 children together: Mary, Robert Lee, Frank Ellwood, and Ruth Elise. His family moved to Spade, Texas, and by 1905, he owned 20,000 acres of land.\n\n\n=== Manhunting and later years ===\nIn 1919, Norfleet went to Dallas to try and sell his property to buy land from Christopher Columbus Slaughter. He lost around US$75,000 (~ $1.3 million in 2024) to six conmen: Joe Furey, E. J. Wared, W. B. Spencer, Charles Gerber, and Reno Hamlin.To get his money back, he went on a 30,000-mile long independent manhunt to capture the conmen. He followed Joe Furey from California to Florida, ending in a fight in a café and Norfleet bringing him back to Fort Worth. He followed W. B. Spencer to Canada, but lost a fight allowing Spencer to escape. Spencer ended up in a Utah prison. He captured three more men in Los Angeles, two more in Salt Lake City, and one in Georgia. He was nicknamed \"Little Tiger\" for being feared despite his short stature of 5 ft 5 in (165 cm).Between 1919 and 1935, Norfleet was responsible for the capture and arrest of over 100 criminals, including Lou Blonger in Summer 1922. He celebrated his 100th birthday in 1965, and died on October 15, 1967, at the age of 102. He is buried at the Lubbock Resthaven Mausoleum in Lubbock, Texas.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJ. Frank Norfleet at Find a Grave",

        "content": "The Artists of Dionysus or Dionysiac Artists (Ancient Greek: οἱ περὶ τὸν Διόνυσον τεχνιταί, romanized: hoi peri ton Dionuson technitai) were an association of actors and other performers who coordinated the organisation of Greek theatrical and musical performances in the Hellenistic Period and under the Roman Empire. They are first attested in the 270s BC, when a number of regional associations are attested. They acted as independent political actors, engaging in collective bargaining with cities, kings, and the Roman Republic, in order to secure a wide range of privileges. They also quarreled with one another and with individual communities. In the late first century BC, following the establishment of the Roman empire, these regional associations mostly faded away.\nUnder the Julio-Claudian emperors, a single \"universal\" or \"ecumenical\" association of artists was established, which called itself the sacred thymelic synod of ecumenical artists of Dionysus, sacred victors, crown-wearers, and their fellow competitors (Ancient Greek: ἡ ἱερὰ θυμελικὴ σύνοδος τῶν ἀπὸ τῆς οἰκουμένης περὶ τὸν Διόνυσον τεχνειτῶν ἱερονεικῶν στεφανειτῶν καὶ τῶν τούτων συναγωνιστῶν), alongside a similar organisation for athletes. It is unclear whether the impetus for this came from the Roman emperors or the artists themselves. These artists flourished in the second and third centuries AD, when they had a headquarters in Rome and performed in festivals from southern Gaul to Egypt and Syria. They disappear from the record around 300 AD and had certainly died out by the 420s AD.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nAncient Greek theatre developed during the Classical Period, especially in the city of Athens, where competitive performances of tragedy and comedy took place in the Theatre of Dionysus at the Dionysia and Lenaia festivals. Initially, the performers were amateurs, drawn from the citizen body. Already in the fifth century BC, however, plays began to be performed abroad and actors (as opposed to chorus members) became increasingly professionalised. In the fourth century BC, these processes accelerated. Performances of \"old tragedies\" and \"old comedies\", as opposed to newly composed works, which are first attested in Athens in 386 BC, became an important part of the theatre scene. Theatrical and musical performances became part of the competition at many Panhellenic games festivals, notably the Pythian and Isthmian games, and mobile theatrical troupes would travel the circuit, performing at these festivals. After Alexander the Great's conquest of Egypt and the Near East, new Panhellenic festivals were established in the conquered territories, as well as in Greece and Asia Minor.\nAnother institution which developed in the fifth century BC and grew increasingly common over the fourth century was the association or club, a collective group, usually centred around worship of a deity and shared meals. These associations usually had officers and common meetings, modelled on the magistrates and assemblies of Greek cities. The members of these associations might share a common place of origin and/or a common activity (e.g. merchants, organising festivals for their patron deity). There were several terms for these associations, including koinon (\"shared thing\") and synodos (\"synod\" or \"meeting\").\n\n\n== Hellenistic Period ==\nThe first attestations of the Dionysiac artists come in the 270s BC. The Dionysiac artists of Athens are mentioned in an inscribed decree passed by the Amphictyony of Delphi between 279 and 277 BC, which confirmed that they enjoyed \"inviolability\" (asylia), rights to safe travel, freedom from military obligations, and tax exemptions. The Egyptian artists are mentioned in Callixenus of Rhodes' description of the Grand Procession organised by Ptolemy II at one of the Ptolemaia festivals of the 270s BC. Both testimonies seem to refer to associations that already existed. Several associations are attested:\n\nThese associations differed from one another in internal structure and general situation. The Athenian association was dependent on the city of Athens and supported Athenian foreign policy goals. The Egyptian association was similarly tied to the Ptolemaic royal court. By contrast, the Isthmian and Nemean association was a \"loose confederation,\" with bases in many cities but not dominated by any of them. The Ionian and Hellespontine association, which was based in the city of Teos, became so powerful that it clashed with the civic authorities.\nMost theatrical performers were not members of the association. The artists were an elite group, who enjoyed special prestige. The different branches of the artists were not unified, as is best known from a long-running conflict between the artists of Athens and the artists of Isthmia and Nemea, mentioned in numerous inscriptions and eventually subject of an arbitration by the Roman Republic.\nThe development of the artists of Dionysus in the early Hellenistic period contrasts with competitors in athletic competitions at festivals, who did not develop an association until the early Imperial period, and competitors in equestrian events, who never developed an association. Remijsen suggests that theatrical performers formed an association early because of their greater level of professionalisation. Bram Fauconnier emphasises the fact that theatrical performers had to collaborate on a performance as part of a team, unlike athletes who always competed as individuals.\n\n\n=== Festival activities ===\nThe artists were able to organise theatrical performances, providing the main actors, supporting actors, technical crew, props, and costumes. Kings, cities, and sanctuaries would contract them to provide these services for a given festival. This included major Panhellenic events, like the Pythian Games, at which multiple branches of the artists might perform, and smaller local events. However, membership of the artists was a prestigious status, enjoyed by only a minority of attested performers in the period. Festivals could always employ the leaders of independent theatrical troupes (ergolaboi). However, these troupes were less prestigious and festival organisers thus preferred to employ the artists of Dionysus if they could afford it.\nVarious procedures for contracting the artists are attested. A decree from Iasos, records that the city sent an embassy to the artists, who held an assembly at which they selected a group of performers, who then negotiated a contract with Iasian embassy. In other cases, the festival organisers may have requested specific performers.\nTheatrical performances at festivals had religious significance and the artists emphasised their devotion to Dionysus and the other gods above all else. In one decree from Delphi, they call themselves \"the most pious of the Greeks.\" In a decree of the Amphictyony, they are granted various privileges and freedoms, \"so that the honours and sacrifices for which [they] are appointed can be carried out for the gods at the appropriate times, as they are free from all other activities and devoted to the services for the gods.\"\n\n\n=== Organisation ===\nLike other Hellenistic associations, the artists' internal organisation were modelled on contemporary Hellenistic city-states. They had laws (nomoi) and passed decrees (psephismata). Administration was carried out by priests managers (epimeletai), treasurers (tamiai), magistrates (archontes), and secretaries (grammateis). Decisions were made at assemblies (synodoi) of all members of the association. On one occasion in the second century BC, the Ionian-Hellespontine association minted its own coinage.\nEach association of artists had one or more headquarters, which took the form of a \"sanctuary\" (temenos) dedicated to Dionysus. Their chief officials served as priests of Dionysus. Their meetings included a range of sacrifices and they hosted their own festivals and religious events in honour of Dionysus.\n\n\n=== Diplomacy ===\nThe associations of artists were independent political entities. They sent their own envoys to cities, kings, and other states and received embassies from them in turn. They appointed citizens of other communities as their official representatives (proxenos).  These interactions often focussed on securing safe passage and tax immunities for their members. In addition, they sent their own sacred ambassadors (theoroi), as their official representatives, to major festivals. They appointed sacred hosts (theorodokoi) to receive foreign sacred ambassadors at their festivals.  All of these actions were typical for city-states in the Hellenistic period, but not of most other associations. \nCommunities seeking to secure the prestigious status of \"crown games\" for a new or existing festival, might make overtures to the artists, asking them to recognise that status. They also helped secure recognition from other cities and competitors. However, the diplomatic role of the artists went far beyond theatrical matters. In the second century BC, for example the Ionian-Hellespontine artists undertook a diplomatic mission to Crete, for example.\n\n\n==== Hellenistic kings ====\nThe artists often maintained particularly close links with the Hellenistic kings, who often connected themselves closely with the god Dionysus and presented themselves in theatrical fashion. The Egyptian artists seem to have been founded and controlled by the Ptolemaic dynasty. It played a central role in Dionysiac procession at the dynasty's Ptolemaia festival in Alexandria and its official title included the \"sibling gods\", King Ptolemy II and Queen Arsinoe II, alongside Dionysus. The Ionian and Hellespontine artists maintained a ruler cult for the Attalid dynasty: the organiser of their Dionysia festival was ex officio priest of the Attalid kings. Paola Ceccarelli proposes that the Athenian branch was founded by King Demetrius Poliorcetes, who was venerated at Athens as the \"New Dionysus\" after 306 BC. They awarded divine honours to Ariarathes V of Cappadocia in the 130s BC and acclaimed Mithridates VI as the \"new Dionysus\" in 88 BC, in both cases acting in support of Athenian foreign policy goals. Jane Lightfoot argued that the artists helped \"to inscribe royal power into the cycle of city life.\" By contrast, Bram Fauconnier presents them as conciliating royal power where it was strong, but operating independently of it elsewhere.\n\n\n==== Inter-association conflicts ====\n\nIn the second century BC, the Ionian and Hellespontine artists took to organising a Dionysia festival with theatrical performances in their home base of Teos. They insisted on collecting and keeping the tax revenues arising from the festival and the Teans objected, eventually appealing to the Attalid king, who ruled in their favour. Subsequently, they were expelled from Teos and fled to Ephesus. Attalus II resettled them at Myonessus, but the Teans appealed this decision to Rome, so they were transferred to Lebedus.\nIn the 130s BC, the Athenian association and the Isthmian-Nemean association came into conflict because their areas of operation overlapped so closely. The associations attempted to collaborate in Thebes and Argos and to establish a common treasury, but the Isthmian artists objected, shutting the Athenians out of their assembly and refusing to pay their money into the common treasury. The dispute was appealed to the Roman Senate, which ruled in favour of the Athenian association.\n\n\n==== Roman Republic ====\nAs Rome expanded into the Eastern Mediterranean in the second century BC, the artists sought to build ties with them. This seems to have initially been successful or at least uneventful. in the first half of the first century BC, however, evidence for the associations becomes sparse and when they do appear, they are often found supporting Roman enemies.\nIn 87 BC, the Athenian association strongly supported Mithridates VI in his conflict with Rome. In the course of the Sulla's siege of Athens in 87 and 86 BC, the association's facilities at Eleusis were destroyed. Their manager, Philemon, had to repair the damage out of his personal funds.\nThe Isthmian-Nemean association and the Cypriot branch of the Egyptian Association are last attested in the early first century BC (it is not attested in Egypt after the third century BC). The Syracusan associations are last attested in 46-45 BC.\nThe Ionian-Hellespontine branch successfully secured immunity from the indemnities Sulla imposed on Asia Minor later in the war. In 69 BC, they were found at Artaxata, the capital of the Roman enemy Tigranes the Great. Strabo mentions them as still active at Lebedus in the early first century AD. Continued survival into the second century AD is shown by their appearance in three inscriptions from Tralleis, Ephesus, and Magnesia on the Maeander. These inscriptions refer to them as the \"local association\" (Ancient Greek: τοπικὴ σύνοδος) to distinguish them from the universal association that developed in the Imperial period.\n\n\n== Imperial period ==\nIn the Imperial period, there was a single association of artists of Dionysus which covered the entire Roman empire. Its exact title varies. In a number of early second century AD inscriptions it calls itself: \"the sacred thymelic association of ecumenical artists of Dionysus, sacred victors, crown-wearers, and their fellow competitors\" (Ancient Greek: ἡ ἱερὰ Θυμελικὴ σύνοδος τῶν ἀπὸ τῆς οἰκουμένης περὶ τὸν Διόνυσον τεχνειτῶν ἱερονεικῶν στεφανειτῶν καὶ τῶν τούτων συναγωνιστῶν), often inserting the name of the reigning emperor alongside Dionysus as a \"new Dionysus\". A sister association represented competitors and organisers of the athletic events at festivals, which was known as the \"sacred xystic association of athletes, sacred victors and crown-wearers of Heracles from the inhabited world.\" The adjective \"thymelic,\" literally \"smoky,\" referred to the smoke from the altar in the centre of the orchestra in a Greek theatre and thus came to mean \"dramatic\" or \"theatrical,\" while \"xystic,\" literally \"sandy,\" referred to the sandy grounds used for athletic events. \"Sacred victors\" and \"crown-wearers\" were terms for victors in different grades of games festival, which were legally defined from the first century AD. It seems that the new titulature of the artists was modelled on that of the athletes.\n\n\n=== Formation ===\nThe transition from a system of several independent regional associations to a single \"ecumenical\" or \"universal\" association covering the whole Roman Empire took place in the late first century BC and early first century AD. It is associated with the development of the various Panhellenic festivals into a set \"circuit\" (periodos), in which all competitors were expected to attend all the top-ranking events. This, in turn, was part of the development of the Mediterranean into a unified network under Roman authority in the first century BC. \n\nThe athletic association first appears in a letter of Mark Antony from the 30s BC, confirming various privileges granted at an early date (perhaps by the Roman Senate or Julius Caesar). The first clear attestation of the universal association of the artists is a papyrus from 43 AD in which the Emperor Claudius (r. 41-54 AD) promises to retain various privileges that the artists had received from Augustus (r. 31 BC-14 AD). It seems that he hired them to perform at the celebrations of the conquest of Britannia in Rome in 44 AD. He reaffirmed their privileges in response to another appeal in 48 AD. The earliest surviving decree of the association is probably an inscription from Teos from the second half of the first century AD, which honours the organiser of a Dionysia Caesarea festival at which they had performed. \nIt is unclear how or when the universal association of the artists developed. Fauconnier proposes three possibilities: (1) the Hellenistic associations of artists merged together; (2) the Ionian-Hellespontine association claimed universal jurisdiction after the other Hellenistic associations died out; (3) the Imperial-period association was a totally new phenomenon. He prefers the last of these hypotheses, and suggests that the founding moment was in 31 BC, shortly before the Battle of Actium, when Mark Antony  gathered the artists of Dionysus on Samos and then gave them a \"dwelling place\" in Priene. However, Le Guen interprets this as a late attestation of the Ionian-Hellespontine association.\nThe role of the emperors and Roman authorities in the establishment of the universal association is also disputed. Lavagne and Le Guen argue that the emperors created it, because performers were a potential source of opposition to their authority and a single universal association was easier for them to monitor. Fauconnier finds \"no evidence that the imperial authorities ever took concerted action to create and develop an agonistic association.\" He sees the artists as the prime movers, with the emperors, particularly Claudius, playing a supportive role.\n\n\n=== Organisation ===\nMost evidence for the artists derives from the second and early third centuries AD, coinciding with the heyday of the Greek festival circuit. This circuit was organised by Hadrian in a set of letters to the artists, known from an inscription found at Alexandria Troas. The circuit comprised dozens of games held across Italy, Greece, and the province of Asia over the course of a four-year cycle, from one Olympic Games to the next. The artists are also attested at festivals outside the circuit in Asia, Bithynia et Pontus, Galatia, Lycia et Pamphylia, Syria, Arabia Petraea, the Aegean islands, Egypt, Thrace, Moesia Inferior, and Gallia Narbonensis.\n\nBy 130 AD, the artists had a headquarters in Rome, where they had a \"holy precinct\" with neocorate status and a high priest. Archaeological finds suggest that this was in or near the Theatre of Pompey. The priests and officials in Rome had the greatest prestige of all the artists, controlled special funds, and dispatched decrees to the artists elsewhere. This  headquarters may have been established immediately after Domitian established the Greek-style festival games, the Capitolia at Rome in 86 AD. Fauconnier thinks that the Capitolia was one reason for establishing the Roman headquarters, alongside a desire for easy access to the Imperial court, but thinks it only occurred in the reign of Hadrian. A branch office, with priests and a council chamber, certainly existed in Athens. An inscription probably indicates that the so-called Temple of Diana in the Sanctuaire de la Fontaine in Nîmes was a precinct of the artists. Another precinct is attested at Side and a \"local association\" is attested at Miletus, Magnesia on the Maeander, and Sardis. But there is no evidence for such branches in most of the locations where the artists performed.\nThe artists held assemblies, called synedria (\"sitting together\") or syllogoi (\"speaking together\"), at which they made decisions by show of hands. The resulting decrees were closely modelled on those passed by cities and leagues. These assemblies took place wherever they happened to meet on the festival circuit. Almost all surviving decrees name the festival at which they were passed. The Sebasta festival in Naples was especially important, since it was the usual venue at which the artists petitioned the emperor. Assemblies seem to have been presided over by three officials, who usually appear in the dating formulae of the decrees: the first archon (archon protos), the secretary archon (archon grammateus), and the law-displaying archon (archon nomodeiktes). These officials held office for a limited time and apparently for a limited geographic area. The latter two officials might have played a role in negotiating the artists' contracts for individual festivals. One of them was probably responsible for finances, since no separate treasurers of the association are attested. The artists had several high priests (archiereis) who operated the artists' Imperial cult. They held office for limited periods and paid a fee for the privilege. An official called the \"manager\" (dioiketes), who appears to have assisted in organising individual festivals at which the artists performed, is attested only in Egypt. On two occasions around AD 200, the emperors appointed curators (logistai) to take control of the artists' finances, probably to resolve specific cases of financial mismanagement.  \n\n\n=== Centralisation and interactions with the emperors ===\nHow centralised the artists were and what role was played by the regional branches is the topic of debate. Most scholars have understood it as a confederation of local branches, which reported to the headquarters in Rome. Aneziri argued that local branches played only a minor role in the Imperial-period association, contrasting this with the regional associations of artists in the Hellenistic period. Onno Van Nijf argued that the association was \"a rather loose agglomeration of various overlapping groups of performers... who could all claim to be somehow connected to [the] imperially recognised, and centrally located association of Rome.\" By contrast, Fauconnier emphasises the uniformity of the artists' institutions, officials, and practices across the whole Roman empire and argues for \"a fixed organisational structure\", in which most of the association's membership, officials, and money were constantly mobile, following the festival circuit and conducting their business in whichever festival they happened to be at at the time. He argues that, while the artists had fixed local headquarters in some cities and some central decisions were taken at Rome, all artists were members of the single ecumenical association and any meeting of artists could make decisions on behalf of the whole organisation.\nThe artists had a close relationship with the emperors. They carried out sacrifices and other rituals for the Imperial cult. Emperors wrote to the artists regularly and often interfered in their affairs, setting their membership fees and sometimes appointing curators to oversee their finances. Hadrian rearranged the timings of festivals throughout the Roman Empire in response to appeals from the artists. Some scholars see the emperors as closely controlling the artists and their sister organisation of athletes, in order to use them as a tool in order to monitor and control festival games generally. Fauconnier argues that Imperial interference conforms to the general pattern of \"petition-and-response\" which characterised most Imperial interactions with their subjects, i.e. emperors usually intervened only in response to appeals from the artists themselves. \n\n\n=== Membership ===\nMembers of the association paid a membership fee (entagion) on enrolment. The amount was the same everywhere in the Empire. In the second century AD, it may have been around 100 denarii. Papyri show that it was 250 denarii by the late third century AD (roughly equivalent to a year's rent for a good house). \nMembers of the association of the artists received a membership certificate. A number of these certificates survive on papyrus recovered from Egypt. They consisted of a dossier of letters from a series of emperors (Claudius, Hadrian, Septimius Severus, Caracalla, and Alexander Severus), confirming the privileges of the association; a letter to association at large announcing that the individual had been admitted and had paid the entrance fee; a dating formula by first archon, secretary archon, law-displaying archon, and the name of the festival at which the certificate was awarded; and a statement by the officials that the individual had been admitted. These certificates entitled their bearers to various privileges in their hometown.\n\n\n=== Finances ===\nThe artists derived funding from various sources. Individual artists paid membership fees when they were enrolled and fines when they broke the association's rules. Officials and priests of the association paid a fee (like the summa honoraria) on appointment. Officials, members, and others also made donations to the artists. These often took the form of endowments of funds and real estate. They derived income from loaning the funds at interest and from rent on the real estate. For example, an inscription describes how Titus Aelius Alcibiades donated a set of stables in Rome to the artists, which they rented out to the profit of the artists in Rome and Anatolia. The artists may have charged a fee to festival organisers and/or collected a portion of the festival taxes. \nThe artists also had various expenses. Their sanctuaries and properties had to be maintained. They paid for honours (crowns, statues, and inscriptions) for the emperors, their benefactors, and members. Sending envoys to the emperors, to cities, and to their members throughout the empire was also expensive. They held various festivals and religious rites of their own, especially in connection with the Imperial cult. In some cases, they helped meet some of the costs of the festivals that they performed at. They may also have paid for funeral costs of their members.  \nThe artists networks of contacts probably allowed them to organise monetary transfers (permutationes) to different parts of the empire. The banking system of the Roman Empire left it to individuals and groups to organise these transfers informally for themselves. \n\n\n=== Decline ===\nEpigraphic evidence for the artists falls away in the second half of the third century AD, but papyrus evidence from Egypt indicates that the association remained active throughout the century. Between 293 and 305 AD, Diocletian or one of his co-rulers issued a Latin rescript restricted the privileges of the artists to those who had won at least three victories, including at least one in Greece or Rome. This rescript refers to a single \"association of athletes and musicians\" (Latin: synodus xysticorum et thymelicorum) which might indicate that the artists had merged with the association for athletes or it could have been a copyist's error. It is unclear whether the restriction of privileges was requested by the artists in order to maintain their exclusivity or imposed upon them by the emperors.\nThe artists are not attested again after this rescript, but may have continued to exist (the association of athletes survived until around 400 AD). If so, the association would not have survived the collapse of the festival circuits over the course of the fourth century AD. Increasingly, audiences preferred to watch pantomime, rather than the tragedies and comedies that had been the mainstay of the artists. In the 380s, Libanius describes the active theatre scene in Antioch as being run by local troupes of mimes and makes no mention of the artists' association.\nThe term \"ecumenical synod\" (Ancient Greek: οἰκουμενικὴ σύνοδος), which had long been used by the artists and their sister association of athletes, was adopted by Christians to describe their own meetings in the 320s or 330s AD.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAneziri, Sophia (2003).

        "content": "Szolnok (also Zounok, Zonunc or Zaunic; killed September 1046) was a Hungarian nobleman in the first half of the 11th century, who served as the first ispán of Szolnok County, which was named after him. Consequently, the town of Szolnok preserved his name to this day. He was killed during the Vata pagan uprising.\n\n\n== Historical interpretations ==\nAccording to historian Gábor Bagi, Szolnok represented the last generation of the royal officials who emerged during the reign of the first Hungarian king Stephen I. He was born in the early years of the 11th century. He plausibly held important positions in the royal court since the beginning of the 1030s. Local historian László Szabó claimed that his name is first mentioned in 1018, but there is no source for that. According to historian György Györffy, Stephen I entrusted Szolnok to establish a royal domain towards the end of his reign, in the second wave of the organization of counties sometime between 1018 and 1038. In contrast, Gyula Kristó considered that Szolnok County was established in the same time when the Diocese of Vác was founded, under the reign of Peter Orseolo, Stephen's successor. Accordingly, Szolnok built the namesake castle (a type of hillfort) at the confluence of the Tisza and Zagyva rivers, which area was the crossroads of several trade routes. The county, named after Szolnok and his newly erected fort, emerged from this castle district in the second half of the 11th century. Its castle folks was first mentioned by the founding charter of Garamszentbenedek Abbey (today Hronský Beňadik, Slovakia) in 1075, the county (or at least an ispánate) already existed at that time. However, the first known ispán, a certain Eusidinus, first appears in this capacity only in 1134.Szolnok possessed inherited estates around the newly established castle district. His jurisdiction also extended to Northern Transylvania. Györffy assumed that Szolnok, beside his office of ispán, perhaps served as Voivode of Transylvania too, since the two positions were demonstrably combined from mid-13th century. Nevertheless, Szolnok could have had more power than the ordinary county administration official, because the Annales Altahenses refers to him as \"princeps\", instead of \"comes\". Under ispán Szolnok, the new emerging centre of royal power became one of the important stations for the transport of salt from the royal mines of Transylvania to the center, as it lay along the salt transport road. Some neighboring lands along the salt road located in Szabolcs, Bihar, Szatmár and Doboka counties were attached to Szolnok County. Kristó emphasized the military importance of the area. According to him, Peter entrusted the region to Szolnok to counter the pagan Vata's growing territory around Békés.Based on the narration of the 14th-century Illuminated Chronicle, Szolnok was a devout Christian, who himself baptized people, including his future murderer Murtmur. Gábor Bagi considered Szolnok could carry out proselytizing activities at the behest of his monarch (Stephen I) in the Central Danube area, certainly before his commission in Szolnok. It is uncertain whose side he was on during the internal war between Peter and Samuel Aba. Initially, Kristó argued that Szolnok was an ardent partisan of Peter, belonging to circle of Gerard of Csanád. László Szegfű, however, emphasized that Gerard fled the Republic of Venice because of his opposition to the Orseolos, therefore, it is not certain that the bishop would have been a supporter of King Peter. Based on Gerard's Deliberatio, historian József Gerics argued that the bishop, like most prelates and nobles, swore loyalty to Samuel Aba. When the Vata pagan uprising broke out in 1046, Szolnok, as a member of the Hungarian elite, resided in Székesfehérvár. Consequently, archaeologist Róbert Kertész considered that Szolnok defected from the allegiance of Peter by that time, and was among those lords, who invited the exiled princes Levente and Andrew to the Hungarian throne.\n\n\n== Death ==\nAs for ispán Szolnok, he mounted upon his horse, leapt into the Danube, and as he swam a certain man named Murtmur took him into his boat in order to save him from death. For this Murtmur had been baptized by ispán Szolnok. But when he wished to save the ispán's life, the heretics began to threaten him with death unless he himself killed ispán Szolnok. Frightened by these threats, Murtmur killed the ispán in the boat with his sword.\nBy the time the two brothers, Andrew and Levente, decided to return, a pagan revolt had broken out in Hungary. The princes made a casual alliance with the pagans led by Vata in order to defeat Peter. Their army marched into Pest. Upon learning of this, Gerard and three other prelates, in addition to Szolnok left Székesfehérvár to meet the princes and swear loyalty to them. However, the pagans captured and slaughtered them at the port of Pest, while attempted to cross the Danube. Three sources mention the death of Szolnok. Regarding of the martyrdom of Gerard and his accompaniment, the contemporary Annales Altahenses says that \"a noble (princeps) named Zaunic was also murdered with them\". The major legend of Saint Gerard, compiled around 1340, also mentions his violent death, similarly to the entire company and entourage of the bishops. The most detailed account (see above quote) is provided by the 14th-century Illuminated Chronicle. Bagi considered that its text preserved a narration of a contemporary record or a lost variation of Gerard's hagiography.Gyula Kristó considered that the murder of both Gerard and Szolnok indicate their personal opposition to Vata. The jurisdiction of both of them (the Diocese of Csanád and the County of Szolnok, respectively) bordered on the territory of Vata around Békés, whose power they threatened both on the ecclesiastical and secular side from the south and northwest. Kristó assumed that Vata's territory may have been affected by attempts at expansionist conversion from the sides of Gerard and Szolnok before 1046.\n\n\n== Descendants ==\nA certain Szolnok (Zounuk) was an advisor of Duke Géza in the early 1070s. He, along with Petrud and Bikács, betrayed his lord just before the Battle of Kemej in February 1074, where King Solomon's troops routed Géza's army. However, ultimately, Géza won a decisive victory at the Battle of Mogyoród in March 1074. Historians consider this Szolnok was the namesake son of ispán Szolnok. His betrayal resulted that his offspring lost significant power and influence, which was never recovered.According to the tradition, the gens (clan) Szolnok descended from him. In the 13th century, they possessed estates around Szolnok Castle, for instance, Szajol and Püspöki. They established the clan's monastery in Tenyő. In addition, they owned some landholdings in Nógrád, Fejér and Baranya counties too.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n=== Primary sources ===\n\n\n=== Secondary studies ===",

        "content": "Broc-Chocolaterie railway station (French: Gare de Broc-Chocolaterie), formerly known as Broc-Fabrique, is a railway station in the municipality of Broc, in the Swiss canton of Fribourg. It takes its name from the adjacent Cailler chocolate factory. It is one of two stations in Broc. The other, Broc-Village, is located in the center of the village. Broc-Chocolaterie is the eastern terminus of the Bulle–Broc railway line.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Chemins de fer électriques de la Gruyère constructed the Bulle–Broc railway line in 1912. Broc opened on 24 June. The line was built as a 1,000 mm (3 ft 3+3⁄8 in) metre gauge line. The line and station were closed between April 2021 and 24 August 2023 for rebuilding as a 1,435 mm (4 ft 8+1⁄2 in) standard gauge line. This permitted direct operation to via Fribourg/Freiburg to Bern. The line reopened on 24 August 2023. As part of the project the station was rebuilt to be accessible, with a new 150 metres (490 ft) platform.\nThe station was renamed Broc-Chocolaterie in December 2023 to emphasize the adjacent Cailler chocolate factory.\n\n\n== Services ==\nAs of the December 2023 timetable change, the following services stop at Broc-Chocolaterie:\n\nRER Fribourg RE2 / RE3: half-hourly service to Düdingen and hourly service to Bern.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nWägli, Hans G.; Jacobi, Sébastien (2010).

        "content": "Alexander, duke of Bournonville (1585–1656) was a nobleman, soldier, diplomat and conspirator with estates in both the Kingdom of France and the Low Countries.\n\n\n== Life ==\nBournonville was born on 4 November 1585, only son of Oudart de Bournonville, baron of Capres, and Marie-Christine of Egmont, daughter of Lamoral of Egmont. In 1600, Henri IV elevated his lordship of Bournonville to a duchy. Alexander was raised as a page boy and courtier at the courts of Paris, Brussels, Vienna and Florence, but received little formal schooling and was barely able to write. At the age of 20 he was appointed captain of a company of 300 Walloons, and a gentleman of the chamber to Archduke Albert. During the Bohemian Revolt he led his own regiment in imperial service, suffering combat injuries on 30 September 1620. In 1621–1622 he served in the Rhineland at the Siege of Jülich. Returning to the Low Countries, on 12 March 1622 he was one of the pallbearers at the funeral of Archduke Albert, who had died the previous year. On 29 August 1622, he took part in the Battle of Fleurus.\nIn 1624 Bournonville received the dedication of Aubert Le Mire's Rerum Belgicarum Annales. He twice served as ambassador extraordinary to Louis XIII of France, and once to Emperor Ferdinand II.\nIn May 1632, in what became known as the Conspiracy of Nobles, Bournonville plotted with the prince of Barbançon, prince of Espinoy and count of Egmont to overthrow Spanish rule and partition the Southern Netherlands between the Kingdom of France and the Dutch Republic. In March 1634, after his involvement in the conspiracy became known to the government, the Great Council of Mechelen convicted him of treason and confiscated his property. He fled to France, where he died in exile on 22 March 1656. His wife, Anne de Melun, withdrew to the Carmelite convent in Antwerp.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Isma'il Kamil Pasha (Egyptian Arabic: إسماعيل كامل باشا, romanized: Ismā‘īl Kamil Bāshā; 1795 – 1822) was the third son of Mahammad Ali Pasha of Egypt, and the leader of the campaign he sent in 1820, to annex Sudan. He was burned to death in a plot prepared for him by Mek Nimr, the Ja'ali King of Shendi, in 1822, in response to an insult directed at him by Ismail, rebuking him for the people of Shendi revolting and attacking slave convoys heading to Egypt.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nIsmail Kamil was the leader of the Sudan campaign of 1820, while Mahammad Bey al-Daftardar was tasked with the conquest of Kordofan. Ismail succeeded in conquering Dongola and subjugated Mek Nimr, King of Shendi, in March 1821. But Nimr quickly rebelled and defected, so Ismail set off against him with an army and entered the capital of the city of Shendi in October 1822. He blamed its king, Nimr, and even slapped him in the face. King Nimr decided to take revenge, so he invited Prince Ismail and the leaders of his forces to a feast in his wooden palace, and gathered around him quantities of hay and dry grass. Ismail was surprised, the king replied that this was the food for the prince's horses and the army leaders, and as soon as everyone settled inside the royal palace, it was completely set on fire. He ordered his soldiers to fire arrows and arrows at everyone in it, and Ismail was killed and burned when he was 27 years old.When Mahammad Bey al-Daftardar learned of this, he set out with his forces from Kordofan to Shendi to take revenge on Mek Nimr, who had fled and taken refuge in the lands of Abyssinia (Ethiopian Empire). Its emperor received him and appointed him ruler of a region inside Abyssinia until he died.Al-Defterdar collected the remains of Ismail's body and carried it to Cairo, where his father, Mahammad Ali, buried him in Hosh al-Basha, with his name recorded on the tombstone in Turkish.\n\n\n== References ==",

Kramer, Brian Poole, Chris Farlowe, Steve Ellis, Dave Berry, Wayne Fontana, and P. J. Proby. Young played on recordings published by Alisha's Attic, a duo that comprises the daughters of Brian Poole. In 1996, Young joined Gerry and the Pacemakers on keys, and toured with the band for over twenty years, until 2018, when frontman Gerry Marsden retired. When Gerry died in January 2021, Young, per Marsden's request, was asked to carry on the legacy of the band as \"Gerry's Pacemakers\". Young left Gerry's Pacemakers in October 2023, to join Herman's Hermits. In turn, the Hermit's keyboardist, Tony Hancox, left the Hermits to join Gerry's Pacemakers on keys. In 2018, Young was enlisted on to the panel to be a music examiner for Trinty College London.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Aavesham (transl. Excitement) is a 2024 Indian Malayalam-language action comedy film directed by Jithu Madhavan and produced by Nazriya Nazim and Anwar Rasheed under the banner of Fahadh Faasil and Friends and Anwar Rasheed Entertainments. The film stars Fahadh Faasil in the lead role, alongside Hipzster , Mithun Jai Shankar, Roshan Shanavas, while Midhutty, Sajin Gopu and Mansoor Ali Khan appear in pivotal supporting roles. The music was composed by Sushin Shyam, while the cinematography and editing were handled by Sameer Thahir and Vivek Harshan.\nAavesham was released on 11 April 2024 to highly positive reviews from critics with praise for its direction, performances (especially Fahadh Faasil and Sajin Gopu), action sequences, cinematography, music and technical aspects. The film became a commercial success by grossing over ₹73 crore (US$9.1 million) against a budget of ₹20 crore (US$2.5 million), where it became the fourth highest-grossing Malayalam film of 2024.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAju, Bibi and Shanthan arrive in Bangalore from Kerala to pursue their engineering degrees, where they opt for the BK Hostel for its perceived freedom compared to college accommodation. Initially, they enjoy their time there, until a confrontation with a senior student Kutty escalates, bruising his ego. In retaliation, Kutty and his gang forcefully take the trio to his place and thrash them, only to offer friendship afterwards. Feeling humiliated, Aju seeks revenge and leads his friends to multiple bars in search of gangsters and they eventually befriend Ranga, a prominent Malayali-Kannadiga gangster in Bangalore.\nDisillusioned by Ranga's lack of action, they realize his gang merely praises him while engaging in minor violence. When Bibi confronts Ranga about the incident with Kutty, Ranga unleashes his fury during the college cultural fest, beating up Kutty and his gang in front of everyone. Despite their initial victory, their association with Ranga begins to consume their lives, affecting their studies. They face expulsion after being unable to pass exams, but are given a second chance, with assurances of passing all future exams. The trio's troubles escalate when they are kidnapped by Reddy, Ranga's former boss. \nReddy accuses Ranga of identity theft and seeks their help to eliminate him. Fleeing from Reddy's threats, they discover a grim truth in the house provided by Ranga. The trio meets Ranga and express their desire to sever ties, revealing that they only befriended him for revenge. Distraught at their betrayal, Ranga faces Reddy's gang alone and emerges victorious, revealing that he kept the boys with him as no one had gotten close to him in his life unless they needed something out of him. Realizing their mistake, they apologize to Ranga. Aju and Bibi are unable to clear their exams, while Shanthan passes them. They encounter Ranga in a new attire outside the college, where he humorously punishes Aju and Bibi for their inability to pass the exams.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nFahadh Faasil as Ranjith Gangadharan Aka Ranga\nSajin Gopu as Amban\nHipster as Ajaz aka Aju\nMithun Jai Shankar as Bibi\nRoshan Shahnavaz as Shanthan\nMidhutty as Kutty\nMansoor Ali Khan as Reddy\nPramod Veliyanad as Ranga's brother\nAshish Vidyarthi as the college executive director (cameo appearance)\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nIn March 2023, Jithu Madhavan announced his second film starring Fahadh Faasil, who also co-produced the film through his production company Fahadh Faasil and Friends with Anwar Rasheed Entertainments. The film's title Aavesham was announced in May 2023. Madhavan wrote the script during early-December 2022 and completed within February 2023 during the period when his debut film Romancham (2022) was delayed from an October 2022 to February 2023. Though, being reported that the film being a spin-off of Romancham, Madhavan later clarified that Aavesham is a standalone film and have no connections with Romancham. The technical crew consisted of Sushin Shyam, Sameer Thahir, Vivek Harshan and Ashwini Kale as music composer, cinematographer, editor and production designer respectively.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nFahadh plays the role of Ranga, a Bangalore-based gangster; He was featured in a thick handlebar moustache and an all-white attire in a leaked picture from the film's production in May 2023. Fahadh attributed that he had not explored such characters before, which led him agreeing to the story, adding that \"Jithu [Madhavan] gave me a very clear understanding of who Ranga would be. However, we finalised the look and attire after we started filming for the movie.\" Compared to his previous films, Fahadh's character would be loud in the film and would speak in a mixture of Kannada and Malayalam, resembling how gangsters from the city would speak. Sajin Gopu, who previously acted in Romancham was assigned for an important role in the film, with Mansoor Ali Khan and Ashish Vidyarthi in supporting roles. The film also featured newcomers including Hipzter, Mithun Jai Shankar, Roshan Shanavas and Midhutty.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nPrincipal photography commenced in Bangalore on the same date as the announcement. The film was shot extensively in Bangalore and its outskirts and production completed in November 2023.\n\n\n== Music ==\n\nThe film's soundtrack composed by Sushin Shyam with lyrics written by Vinayak Sasikumar featured nine songs performed by independent artists. The soundtrack was released by Think Music on 19 April 2024 after being preceded by four singles: \"Jaada\", \"Galatta\", \"Illuminati\" and \"Mathapithakkale\".\n\n\n== Marketing ==\nThe film's theatrical teaser trailer was unveiled on 25 January 2024. A promotional event was held at the Union Christian College, Aluva on 26 March 2024 with the presence of Fahadh, Madhavan and Shyam, along with the principal cast.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Theatrical ===\nAavesham was theatrically released on 11 April 2024, during the Eid al-Fitr and Vishu weekend. It was earlier scheduled for theatrical release during the Onam (25 August 2023) and Christmas weekends (22 December 2023), but Fahadh in July 2023 announced that the film will be released during the first quarter of 2024. Its current release date was announced in December. The film will be distributed by A&A Release across India, while Phars Film acquiring the overseas theatrical rights.\nAavesham was listed as one of the \"most anticipated Malayalam films of 2024\" by several publications and industry sources.

More than 50,000 admissions from Kerala theatres were recorded from 567 tracked shows. The film, along with several other Malayalam films, were not released at PVR INOX multiplex chains across India in response to a dispute between the Film Employees Federation of Kerala and the authorities of PVR INOX management over Virtual Print Fee, as well as the federation's plans on distributing films through their newly established content providing service over Qube Cinema Technologies,the primary content provider for PVR INOX theatres. However, the ban was lifted on 13 April and the film was released in the multiplex chains the following day. \nPrior to the film's release, the film garnered U/A certificate from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) with the duration of the final edit being 157 minutes. A scene from the film's second half was being removed prior to the theatrical showcasing in Kuwait, owing to the recommendation of the censor board.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nThe film's digital rights were acquired by Amazon Prime Video.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAavesham received highly positive reviews from critics with praise for its performances (especially Fahadh Faasil and Sajin Gopu), script, direction, action sequences, humor, music and technical aspects.\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nOn the opening day of its release, the film grossed ₹3.9 crores worldwide, gaining first spot between concurrent releases Varshangalku Shesham and Jai Ganesh. The film's ticket sales were further boosted by its positive word of mouth, which helped it to earn a total ₹15.9 crores domestically on Vishu holiday. As of 19 April 2024, the film has grossed ₹65 crore worldwide.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nGoutham S of Pinkvilla gave 4/5 stars and wrote \"Aavesham is ideally one of those movies that you could enjoy in theaters if you love a comedy film with a wild ride happening. The show is definitely run by Fahadh Faasil who is all set to entertain you with a great array of actors supporting him.\" Anandu Suresh of The Indian Express gave 3.5/5 stars and wrote \"Nevertheless, the performances make up for the narrative flaws in Aavesham.\" \nAnna Mathews of The Times of India gave 3.5/5 stars and wrote \"Apart from scripting superb side characters, Jithu Madhavan has crafted the comic timing of his dialogues well.\" Janani K of India Today gave 3.5/5 stars and wrote \"Aavesham is truly an enjoyable affair with brilliantly choreographed action sequences and comedy sequences. If you're a fan of Fahadh Faasil, then Aavesham will prove why you became his fan in the first place.\" \nNirmal Jovial of The Week gave 3.5/5 stars and wrote \"The film maintains a celebratory mood from beginning till end.\" Arjun Menon of Rediff rated 3/5 stars and applauded \"Aavesham is smooth in its storytelling and leaves a chilling aftertaste, thanks to its one-of-a-kind anti-hero.\"\nSwathi P Ajith of Onmanorama termed it as \"the perfect choice if you're seeking laughter and entertainment in equal measure.\" S. R. Praveen of The Hindu wrote \"Romancham director Jithu Madhavan returns with his sophomore effort, that is held afloat by Fahadh Faasil running riot in one of his most colourful characters.\"\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAavesham at IMDb",

Liga was the third tier of the Swiss football league system and it was also the highest level of amateur football,  even though there was an ever-increasing number of clubs in this league that played with professional or semi-professional players.\n\n\n== Format ==\nThere were 48 teams in this division this season, including eight U-21 teams, which were the eldest youth teams of the professional clubs in the Super League and the Challenge League. The 1. Liga was divided into three regional groups, each with 16 teams. Within each group, the teams would play a double round-robin to decide their positions in the league. The three group winners and the three runners-up then contested a play-off for the two promotion slots. The U-21 teams were not eligible for promotion and could not compete the play-offs. The last placed team in each group were directly relegated to the 2. Liga Interregional.\n\n\n== Group 1 ==\n\n\n=== Teams ===\n\n\n=== Final league table ===\n\n\n== Group 2 ==\n\n\n=== Teams ===\n\n\n=== Final league table ===\n\n\n=== Decider ===\nThe two teams Solothurn and Young Fellows Juventus ended the season level on points and so they had to play a decision match to resolve second position and the play-off slot. This match was played on May 21, 2002, in Sursee.\n\n  SC Young Fellows Juventus win and advance, as group runner-up, to play-offs.\n\n\n== Group 3 ==\n\n\n=== Teams ===\n\n\n=== Final league table ===\n\n\n== Promotion play-off ==\nThe three group winners and the three runners-up contested this play-off for the two promotion slots.

Group 2 champions were Schaffhausen and runners-up were Young Fellows Juventus. Group 3 champions were Malcantone, runners-up were Wohlen. These six teams played a qualification and the three winners played a single round-robin to decide the two promotion slots. Wohlen and Schaffhausen secured their promotion to the second tier. Wohlen were 1. Liga champions.\nFrom group 1 relegated were Lausanne-Sport U-21 and Sion U-21. Relegated from group 2 were the two clubs Red Star and Schwamendingen and from group 3 the two teams Freienbach and Rorschach also suffered relegation. The remaining teams in the division were to be joined in following season by ES Malley, Martigny-Sports, Zofingen, Aarau U-21, Biaschesi and Frauenfeld, each of which had won their 2. Liga Interregional groups.\n\n\n== See also ==\n2001–02 Nationalliga A\n2001–02 Swiss Cup\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n2001–02 at RSSSF\nSeason 2001–02 at the official website",

        "content": "In probability theory, the KPZ fixed point is a markov field and conjectured to be a universal limit of a wide range of stochastic models forming the universality class of a non-linear stochastic partial differential equation called the KPZ equation. Even though the universality class was already introduced in 1986 with the KPZ equation itself, the KPZ fixed point was not concretely specified until 2021 when mathematicians Konstantin Matetski, Jeremy Quastel and Daniel Remenik gave an explicit description of the transition probabilities in terms of Fredholm determinants.\n\n\n== Introduction ==\nAll models in the KPZ class have in common, that they have a fluctuating height function or some analogue function, that can be thought of as a function, that models the growth of the model by time. The KPZ equation itself is also a member of this class and the canonical model of modelling random interface growth. The strong KPZ universality conjecture conjectures that all models in the KPZ universality class converge under a specific scaling of the height function to the KPZ fixed point and only depend on the initial condition.\nMateski-Quastel-Remenik constructed the KPZ fixed point for the (1+1){\\displaystyle (1+1)}-dimensional KPZ universality class (i.e. one space and one time dimension) on the polish space of upper semicontinous functions (UC) with the topology of local UC convergence. They did this by studying a particular model of the KPZ universality class the TASEP („Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process“) with general initial conditions and the random walk of its associated height function. They achieved this by rewriting the biorthogonal function of the correlation kernel, that appears in the Fredholm determinant formulat for the multi-point distribution of the particles in the Weyl chamber. Then they showed convergence to the fixed point.\n\n\n== KPZ fixed point ==\nLet h(t,x→){\\displaystyle h(t,{\\vec {x}})} denote a height function of some probabilistic model with (t,x→)∈R×Rd{\\displaystyle (t,{\\vec {x}})\\in \\mathbb {R} \\times \\mathbb {R} ^{d}} denoting space-time. So far only the case for d=1{\\displaystyle d=1}, also noted as (1+1){\\displaystyle (1+1)}, was deeply studied, therefore we fix this dimension for the rest of the article. In the KPZ universality class exist two equilibrium points or fixed points, the trivial Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) fixed point and the non-trivial KPZ fixed point. The KPZ equation connects them together.\nThe KPZ fixed point is rather defined as a height function h(t,x→){\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {h}}(t,{\\vec {x}})} and not as a particular model with a height function.\n\n\n=== KPZ fixed point ===\nThe KPZ fixed point (h(t,x))t≥0,x∈R{\\displaystyle ({\\mathfrak {h}}(t,x))_{t\\geq 0,x\\in \\mathbb {R} }} is a markov process, such that the n-point distribution for x1<x2<⋯<xn∈R{\\displaystyle x_{1}<x_{2}<\\cdots <x_{n}\\in \\mathbb {R} } and t>0{\\displaystyle t>0} can be represented as\n\nPh(0,⋅)(h(t,x1)≤a1,h(t,x2)≤a2,…,h(t,xn)≤an)=det(I−K)L2({x1,x2,…,xn}×R){\\displaystyle \\mathbb {P} _{{\\mathfrak {h}}(0,\\cdot )}({\\mathfrak {h}}(t,x_{1})\\leq a_{1},{\\mathfrak {h}}(t,x_{2})\\leq a_{2},\\dots ,{\\mathfrak {h}}(t,x_{n})\\leq a_{n})=\\det(I-K)_{L^{2}(\\{x_{1},x_{2},\\dots ,x_{n}\\}\\times \\mathbb {R} )}}where a1,…,an∈R{\\displaystyle a_{1},\\dots ,a_{n}\\in \\mathbb {R} } and K{\\displaystyle K} is a trace class operator called the extended Brownian scattering operator and the subscript means that the process in h(0,⋅){\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {h}}(0,\\cdot )} starts.\n\n\n=== KPZ universality conjectures ===\nThe KPZ conjecture conjectures that the height function h(t,x→){\\displaystyle h(t,{\\vec {x}})} of all models in the KPZ universality at time t{\\displaystyle t} fluctuate around the mean with an order of t1/3{\\displaystyle t^{1/3}} and the spacial correlation of the fluctuation is of order t2/3{\\displaystyle t^{2/3}}. This motivates the so-called 1:2:3 scaling which is the characteristic scaling for the KPZ fixed point. The EW fixed point has also a scaling the 1:2:4 scaling. The fixed points are invariant under their associated scaling.\n\n\n==== 1:2:3 scaling ====\nThe 1:2:3 scaling of a height function is for ε>0{\\displaystyle \\varepsilon >0}\n\nε1/2h(ε−3/2t,ε−1x)−Cεt,{\\displaystyle \\varepsilon ^{1/2}h(\\varepsilon ^{-3/2}t,\\varepsilon ^{-1}x)-C_{\\varepsilon }t,}where 1:3 and 2:3 stand for the proportions of the exponents and Cε{\\displaystyle C_{\\varepsilon }} is just a constant.\n\n\n==== Strong conjecture ====\nThe strong conjecture says, that all models in the KPZ universality class converge under 1:2:3 scaling of the height function if their initial conditions also converge, i.e.\n\nlimε→0ε1/2(h(c1ε−3/2t,c2ε−1x)−c3ε−3/2t)=(d)h(t,x){\\displaystyle \\lim \\limits _{\\varepsilon \\to 0}\\varepsilon ^{1/2}(h(c_{1}\\varepsilon ^{-3/2}t,c_{2}\\varepsilon ^{-1}x)-c_{3}\\varepsilon ^{-3/2}t)\\;{\\stackrel {(d)}{=}}\\;{\\mathfrak {h}}(t,x)}with initial condition\n\nh(0,x):=limε→0ε1/2h(0,c2ε−1x),{\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {h}}(0,x):=\\lim \\limits _{\\varepsilon \\to 0}\\varepsilon ^{1/2}h(0,c_{2}\\varepsilon ^{-1}x),}where c1,c2,c3{\\displaystyle c_{1},c_{2},c_{3}} are constants depending on the model.\n\n\n==== Weak conjecture ====\nIf we remove the growth term in the KPZ equation, we get\n\n∂th(t,x)=ν∂x2h+σξ,{\\displaystyle \\partial _{t}h(t,x)=\\nu \\partial _{x}^{2}h+\\sigma \\xi ,}which converges under the 1:2:4 scaling\n\nlimε→0ε1/2(h(c1ε−2t,c2ε−1x)−c3ε−3/2t)=(d)h(t,x){\\displaystyle \\lim \\limits _{\\varepsilon \\to 0}\\varepsilon ^{1/2}(h(c_{1}\\varepsilon ^{-2}t,c_{2}\\varepsilon ^{-1}x)-c_{3}\\varepsilon ^{-3/2}t)\\;{\\stackrel {(d)}{=}}\\;{\\mathfrak {h}}(t,x)}to the EW fixed point. The weak conjecture says now, that the KPZ equation is the only Heteroclinic orbit between the KPZ and EW fixed point.\n\n\n=== Airy process ===\n\nIf one fixes the time dimension and looks at the limit\n\nlimt→∞t−1/3(h(c1t,c2t2/3x)−c3t)=(d)A(x),{\\displaystyle \\lim \\limits _{t\\to \\infty }t^{-1/3}(h(c_{1}t,c_{2}t^{2/3}x)-c_{3}t){\\stackrel {(d)}{=}}\\;{\\mathcal {A}}(x),}then one gets the Airy process (A(x))x∈R{\\displaystyle ({\\mathcal {A}}(x))_{x\\in \\mathbb {R} }} which also occurs in the theory of random matrices.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Metrorrey Line 6 is one of the three lines currently planned by Metrorrey, which will connect the municipalities of Monterrey, Guadalupe, San Nicolás de los Garza and Apodaca. It will have an extension of approximately 17.6 kilometers. It will connect with lines 3, 4 and 5 at the Saint Lucia station, in front of the High Specialty Medical Unit No. 33 of the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS). It connects to line 1 at the Y.A. station. Officially it does not have a distinctive color, but on the map, it is shown as purple.\nOn 29 April 2022, the Government of the State of Nuevo León launched an international public tender for the construction of the line. Construction work began on 11 February 2023. The second stage of the construction of 13.5 kilometers of lines 4 and 6 is expected to be completed on 30 November 2024.\nIt will begin at the Hospital de Gynecología; in Monterrey, it continues along Avenida Constitución, Parque Fundidora, Prolongación Madero, Miguel Alemán Avenue, and ends in the center of the municipality of Apodaca.\nGovernor Samuel García has mentioned on several occasions an extension to the future that connects with Monterrey International Airport, located on the outskirts of the municipality of Apodaca.[1]\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Line 5 controversy ===\n\nIn the early 2022, following the announcement of the first master plan of the new lines of the Metrorrey, neighbors of southern Monterrey demonstrated against the construction of line 5 by considering that a high viaduct will be detrimental to this whole sector, demanding that the line should be underground. They argued that lanes would be reduced on Garza Sada Avenue, businesses with the works would be closed and, in addition, aesthetically, will impact the properties and surplus value. For this reason, on 15 February 2022 they protested in front of the Palace of Government, where they delivered a letter addressed to the governor of Nuevo León, Samuel García, to listen to them and build Line 5 underground.\n\n\n=== Line 6 project ===\nAfter protests by the neighbors of the south of Monterrey, the government of Nuevo León announced that they would include in the master plan a Line 6 that would travel from the center of the municipality of Monterrey to the center of the municipality of Apodaca in case the construction of Line 5 was not possible. In March 2022, the governor of Nuevo León, Samuel García warned the opponents of Line 5, that the work will be built thus that it was announced that the three lines would be built.\n\n\n=== Tendering process ===\nOn 9 September 2022, the technical openings were completed as part of the process of the international public tender, two consortia were registered to win the award of the construction of Lines 4, 5 and 6. One of the consortia is made up of the companies Mota-Engil Mexico and China Communications Construction Company, which also have the construction of a section of the Tren Maya. The other consortium consists of the companies Ferrovías del Bajío, Hércules Construcciones de Monterrey, Constructora Moyeda, Manufacturas Metálicas Ajax, Tordec, Inversiones Ferroviarias de México, Consega Diseño y Construcciones, and Vivienda y Construcciones.\nOn 15 September 2022 the economic proposals were submitted by both consortia and, in accordance with the timetable for the tender, on 23 September 2022 the final judgment was awarded to the winning consortium. During the presentation stage of economic proposals for construction, the Secretariat of Urban Mobility and Planning of Nuevo León rejected the proposal of the consortium composed of the Mexican companies Ferrovías del Bajío, Hércules Construcciones de Monterrey, Constructora Moyeda, Manufacturas Metálicas Ajax, Tordec, Inversiones Ferroviarias de México, Consega Diseño y Construcciones, and Vivienda y Construcciones. It was explained that in none of the above-mentioned contracts had the consortium built any light rail, metro, or monorail lines in the last 15 years. Similarly, they were made aware that braking traction systems and automatic driving systems have not been constructed or operated by any of the members of that consortium.\nOn 23 September 2022, the tender was awarded for the construction of lines 4, 5 and 6 of the Metro to the consortium formed by the Portuguese firm Mota-Engil de México and the Chinese CRRC Hong Kong. At a press conference, it was reported that CRRC will be the supplier of rolling stock, while Mota-Enegil will take care of the construction. The Secretary of Urban Mobility and Planning of Nuevo León Hernán Villarreal explained that the tender has two cost options and that both are profitable for the administration. If the 3 lines are raised, the amount will amount to 25.861 million pesos plus VAT. If line 5 is built at level, the cost would drop to 25.857 million pesos plus VAT. The consortium formed by Mota-Engil and CRRC will sign the contract on 26 September at 10:00, at the offices of the Legal Directorate of the Secretariat of Mobility and Urban Planning, located in the Administrative Tower. Regarding the possibility of building part of the transport system at the street level, during the reading of the failure of the SMPU-LPI-001-2022 tender it was specified that this topic will be defined in November 2024.\nThe construction process began on 30 September 2022 for lines 4 and 6 being monorail type. A popular consultation will be held in November 2024 to determine whether Metrorrey Line 5 will be an elevated monorail or a rapid transit line at ground level.\n\n\n=== Protests on its construction ===\nOn 3 February 2023, a group of residents of the Linda Vista, Libertad and La Lolita colonies in the municipality of Guadalupe held a protest against the high construction of lines 5 and 6 of the Metrorrey. The demonstration took place on Miguel Alemán Avenue at the height of Larga Vista Street and was attended by approximately 30 people. The protest participants stated that they were not consulted on the construction of the subway and that they have had difficulty communicating with the authorities. The protest blankets reflected their opposition to the elevated construction of the subway, but supported underground construction because it would not affect traffic on Miguel Alemán Avenue. In addition, they asked Governor Samuel García for a detailed assessment of the construction of the subway line on Miguel Alemán Avenue, due to concerns about the presence of aquifer mantles on the avenue.\nOn 11 February 2023, dozens of people showed up outside an enclosure where state authorities were present to protest against the mobility projects promoted by the governor of Nuevo León, Samuel García. The protest took place during an event related to the start of the construction of Line 6 of the Metrorrey. Protesters expressed dissatisfaction with the construction projects of Metro lines 5, considering that their high format would generate obstructions to the road. However, they would agree to the realization of Line 6 in underground format.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\nAt the beginning of 2023, it was announced that construction of the infrastructure of Line 6 would begin on February 11, 2023. This consisted of carrying out the first verification survey for the deep foundation. That day the construction start ceremony was held. The governor of Nuevo León Samuel García led the event. The construction of Line 6 is expected to provide services to more than 120 thousand users and is part of the pillars of the Mobility Master Plan, with the aim of improving mobility in the Monterrey metropolitan area. The ceremony was attended by the technical secretary of the State, Mario Ramón Silva Rodríguez, and the secretary of Mobility and Urban Planning, Hernán Manuel Villarreal Rodríguez, among others. Governor García assured that the construction will be carried out efficiently, effectively and quickly, without causing an impact on the citizens.\nWithin the framework of the construction of Metro Line 6, tasks have been planned that include the layout, station design, rolling stock, yard and workshop, as well as road adaptations on its route. The first phase of Line 6 will have a length of 9 kilometers, from the Y Griega to Citadel, passing through the municipalities of Monterrey, Guadalupe, San Nicolás de los Garza and Apodaca.\nThe Secretary of Mobility and Urban Planning, Hernán Manuel Villarreal Rodríguez, reported that the construction process of Line 6 will begin with a section that will include the Citadel station, where the yard will be located and the rolling stock will be stored. The official asked the population for patience during the work, since, although it has been planned to avoid the closure of roads and allow the transit of urban public transport along its usual routes, it will be necessary to reduce from one to two central lanes during the drilling period. for the foundation and two to three lanes during the construction stage.\n\n\n== Stations ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nMetrorrey\nMetrorrey Line 1\nMetrorrey Line 2\nMetrorrey Line 3\nMetrorrey Line 4\nMetrorrey Line 5\nEcovía\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2002–03 Swiss 1. Liga was the 71st season of this league since its creation in 1931 and it was the third tier of the Swiss football league system. The 1. Liga was also the highest level of amateur football, even though there was an ever-increasing number of clubs in this league that played with professional or semi-professional players in their ranks and this not just in the U-21 teams of the professional clubs.\n\n\n== Format ==\nThere were 48 teams in this division this season, including seven U-21 teams, which were the eldest youth teams of the professional clubs in the Super League and the Challenge League. The 1. Liga was divided into three regional groups, each with 16 teams. Within each group, the teams would play a double round-robin to decide their positions in the league. The three group winners and the three runners-up, together with the two best third placed teams, then contested a play-off for the four promotion slots. The U-21 teams were not eligible for promotion and could not compete the play-offs. The last placed teams in each group were to contest a play-out to decide relegation, two teams would be relegated to the 2. Liga Interregional.\n\n\n== Group 1 ==\n\n\n=== Teams ===\n\n\n=== Final league table ===\n\n\n== Group 2 ==\n\n\n=== Teams ===\n\n\n=== Final league table ===\n\n\n== Group 3 ==\n\n\n=== Teams ===\n\n\n=== Final league table ===\n\n\n== Promotion play-off ==\n\n\n=== Finals ===\n  Meyrin win 4–2 on aggregate and are promoted to 2003–04 Challenge League.\n  Malcantone win 3–2 on aggregate and are promoted to 2003–04 Challenge League.\n  Chiasso win 4–2 on aggregate and were promoted to 2003–04 Challenge League.\n  Bulle win 4–1 on aggregate and were promoted to 2003–04 Challenge League.\nLa Chaux-de-Fonds were later also promoted later on the green table by the Swiss Football Association up to the 2003–04 Challenge League following the fact that FC Sion were refused their licence for that division.\n\n\n== Play-out against relegation ==\nAarau U-21 withdrew from play-outs and were so relegated directly. The one remaining match was played in a neutral venue, on May 25 in Solothurn.\n\nFC Stade Nyonnais win 5–4 in the penalty shoot-out. Rapperswil-Jona were relegated. Stade Nyonnais remain at this level.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nGroup 1 champions were Meyrin, runners-up were Bulle and they both achieved promotion. Group 2 champions were Young Fellows Juventus and runners-up were Wangen b.O. but they both failed in their promotion attempts in the play-offs. Group 3 champions were Malcantone, runners-up Chiasso and both these teams also achieved promotion. Third placed team in group 2 La Chaux-de-Fonds were later also promoted to 2003–04 Challenge League, as best loser, following the fact that FC Sion were refused a licence for that division.\nDue to the bankruptcy of FC Lausanne-Sport, who were demoted to the fourth tier, no team from the higher tier would join the 1. Liga. The remaining teams in the division were to be joined in next season by FC Sierre, Young Boys U-21, SC Dornach, FC Seefeld Zürich, FC Red Star Zürich and SC Cham who had all achieved promotion from the 2. Liga Interregional.\n\n\n== See also ==\n2002–03 Nationalliga A\n2002–03 Swiss Cup\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nSwitzerland 2002–03 at RSSSF\nSeason 2002–03 at the official website",

The bout took place on 17 March 2024, Saint Patrick's Day at the TF Royal Theatre in Castlebar, County Mayo, Ireland. \n\n\n== Background ==\nIt was Whyte's first professional boxing fight in 16 months. He was scheduled to have a rematch against Anthony Joshua but failed a drug test. He told Sky Sports ahead of the fight: \"I'm just glad to be back, doing what I love doing. I'm not getting any younger,\" \"Obviously there's a lot of good fights going on. I just want to get back in the mix. I still want to fight all of these guys and show that I'm still one of the best heavyweights around.\" Whyte last fought Jermaine Franklin at The O2 Arena, London in November 2022.\n\n\n== The fight ==\nWhyte defeated Hammer after the third-round via corner retirement. The card also featured the last boxing match of Ray Moylette's career, who fought in his hometown in a victory over Argentine Reuquen Cona Facundo Arce. Other matches on the card featured Thomas Carty defeating Pavel Sour, and Gary 'Spike' O'Sullivan lost to Sofiane Khati.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Pasquale Marco Carcani (March or May 1721 – 12 November 1783) was an Italian scholar, philologist and jurist. He was also known by his pseudonym Sofista Pericalle.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBorn in Naples to Marco Carcani and Maria Angela de Matteis, his family originated in \"Gefunio, or Junonis Fano in the agro Picentinorum\", now known as Giffoni Valle Piana in the Principato Citra. The last of  six brothers, when Pasquale was aged seven his mother remarried to Onofrio Roseti, meaning he was educated by his stepfather and his eldest brother Domenico, showing early promise.\nAfter studying grammar and rhetoric, he began studying maths with Mario Lama, physics professor at the Regia Università di Napoli and with his brother Nicola Maria (1716–1764), a Piarist priest and director of the Collegio reale di San Carlo alle Mortelle. There he studied the then-dominant Cartesianism and Aristotle's works in the original ancient Greek, having taught himself that language. He then studied canon and civil law under Marcello Papiniano Cusano, then theology and more canon law under Pio Milante.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAs a young man he joined the Accademia Cosentina. When Pasquale was aged 21 Domenico died and so devoted himself to jurisprudence and then politics, whilst sticking with literature, which was always his first love. He also attended lawyer, philologist and jurist Girolamo Pandolfelli's Accademia degli Emuli, hosted in Pandolfelli's own rooms, where he met the era's best scholars and adopted the pseodnym Sofista Pericalle.\nIn 1755, he was chosen as one of the fifteen members of the Accademia Ercolanese, later becoming its permanent secretary, a role he held until his death. From 1759 to 1776, he was the right-hand-man to marchese Bernardo Tanucci, secretary of state to Naples' royal court during the reign of Charles III. Tanucci appointed him to the secretariat for foreign affairs and for the royal household, involved him in the most important matters and used him for difficult and secret missions. He died in Naples.\n\n\n== Works ==\nLe Antichità di Ercolano\nComponimenti vari per la morte di D. Domenico Jannacone\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography (in Italian) ==\nGiuseppe Niccolò F.

She was a prolific and pioneering investigator of fungal diseases. In 1982, the International Society for Human & Animal Mycology (ISHAM) established the Lucille Georg Award in her honor. A memoriam about her life and accomplishments was published by Mycoses. To this day, a great many of the best quality images of fungal pathogens were contributed by Georg.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2003–04 Swiss 1. Liga was the 72nd season of this league since its creation in 1931 and, at this time, it was the third tier of the Swiss football league system. The 1. Liga was also the highest level of amateur football, even though there was an ever-increasing number of clubs in this league that played with professional or semi-professional players in their ranks, not just the U-21 teams of the professional clubs.\n\n\n== Format ==\nThere were 48 teams in this division this season, including seven U-21 teams, which were the eldest youth teams of the professional clubs in the Super League and the Challenge League. The 1. Liga was divided into three regional groups, each with 16 teams. Within each group, the teams would play a double round-robin to decide their positions in the league. The three group winners and the three runners-up, together with the two best third placed teams, then contested a play-off for the two promotion slots. The U-21 teams were not eligible for promotion and could not compete the play-offs. The two last placed teams in each group were to be relegated to the 2. Liga Interregional.\nIn advance of this season, FC Sion had been denied a licence by the Swiss Football Association (ASF-SFV) for the 2003–04 Challenge League and were, therefore, demoted to the amateur level. The club contested this in the courts and on 29 October 2003 the court decided how to settle this matter. Due to the settlement decision, the ASF-SFV were forced to withdraw the club from this division and to admit them to the Challenge League, the next highest tier. From this moment, group 1 continued with just 15 teams and all results of the matches with Sion were voided. Due to this decision only five teams from this level were then to be relegated, to re-increase the competition back to the original 48 teams.\n\n\n== Group 1 ==\n\n\n=== Teams ===\n\n\n=== Final league table ===\n\n\n== Group 2 ==\n\n\n=== Teams ===\n\n\n=== Final group table ===\n\n\n== Group 3 ==\n\n\n=== Teams ===\n\n\n=== Final league table ===\n\n\n== Promotion play-off ==\nQualified for the play-offs were the first two teams from group 1; Étoile Carouge and Baulmes, from group 2; Young Fellows Juventus and because Basel U-21 were not eligible to the play-offs, this right was passed down to Wangen b.O.. Then from group 3 the first two teams were Locarno and Kreuzlingen. Because in group 2 the third placed team was already qualified in this situation, the two best third best teams were Malley from group 1 and Tuggen from group 3 and they also advanced to the play-off stage.\n\n\n=== Qualification round ===\n  Tuggen win 5–4 on aggregate and continue to the finals.\n  Young Fellows Juventus win 3–1 on aggregate and continue to the finals.\n  1–1 on aggregate, Locarno win  on away goals and continue to the finals.\n  Baulmes win 5–3 on aggregate and continue to the finals.\n\n\n=== Final round ===\n  Young Fellows Juventus win 5–3 on aggregate and are promoted to 2004–05 Challenge League.\n  Baulmes win 3–2 on aggregate and are promoted to 2004–05 Challenge League.\n\n\n== Relegation play-out ==\n  Altstetten win 3–2 on aggregate and remain in the division. Vevey Sports is relegated to 2. Liga Interregional.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nGroup 1 champions were Étoile Carouge and runners-up were Baulmes. Carouge failed for promotion during the play-offs, in contrast to Baulmes, who won their finals. Baulmes were declaired as 1. Liga champions. Group 2 champions were [[SC Young Fellows Juventus]|Young Fellows Juventus]], runners-up were Basel U-21 but they were not eligible to the play-offs, this right was passed down to third placed Wangen b.O.. YFJ achieved promotion during the play-offs, but Wangen b.O. failed. Group 3 champions were Locarno and Kreuzlingen were runners-up. Both teams failed in their promotion attempts in the play-off stage.\nThe remaining teams in the division were to be joined in next season by Lausanne-Sport, FC Alle, FC Langenthal, FC Brugg and FC Herisau as the five 2. Liga Interregional group winners and by Urania Genève Sport, who were the best placed runners-up. They were also joined by SR Delémont who had suffered relegation from the 2003–04 Challenge League.\n\n\n== See also ==\n2003–04 Swiss Super League\n2003–04 Swiss Challenge League\n2003–04 Swiss Cup\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nSwitzerland 2003–04 at RSSSF\nSeason 2003–04 at the official website",

In 1624 he became a knight of the Golden Fleece, despite which he became embittered at not being entrusted with any significant office either at court or in government. He took part in the Conspiracy of Nobles (1632) with the prince of Espinoy, the prince of Barbançon, and the duke of Bournonville, and afterwards fled to France. Isabella Clara Eugenia, the head of the government in Brussels, made diplomatic protests against him being received at the French court, but no legal action was taken against him until 1638, when Philip IV of Spain took steps to have him prosecuted as a traitor. Unlike his fellow conspirators, he was never sentenced or punished. He died in exile at Saint-Cloud, outside Paris, on 27 July 1645. His widow, Marie-Marguerite of Berlaymont, returned to Brussels after his death, dying there on 17 March 1654. Their son, Louis Philip of Egmont, inherited their properties and titles and became an influential member of the nobility not only in the Spanish Netherlands but in the wider Spanish Monarchy.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "DeeRonn Booker is an American professional ten-pin bowler. On March 31, 2024, Booker became the third African American bowler to win a major title on the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) Tour.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOriginally from Pomona, California, Booker lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico where he is the pro shop manager of the Starlight Bowling Center located inside the Santa Ana Star Casino Hotel.\nIn 2009, Booker appeared on The Price Is Right television show, winning the showcase showdown.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nBooker won the doubles Eagle at the July 2023 USBC Open Championships, and during January 2023's Team USA Trials Booker led the first round of qualifying. From 2018 through 2023, Booker cashed in 13 of 36 PBA events.\nOn March 31, 2024, in his second year as a full-time professional bowler and in his PBA Tour television debut, Booker won the 2024 USBC Masters tournament held at Suncoast Bowling Center in Las Vegas. This, his first tour title, was in a major PBA national tournament. He qualified 58th out of 465 players in the 64-player double-elimination phase, but won six consecutive three-game total pinfall matches to earn the No. 1 seed position for the stepladder final. He won the championship game and received the $100,000 first prize.\nBooker thus became the third African American man to win on the PBA Tour, joining George Branham III (1993) and Gary Faulkner Jr. (2015).\nBooker's \"strike song\" during the televised March 2024 Masters broadcast was the Price is Right theme song, a reference to his 2009 appearance on that TV show.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of ten-pin bowlers\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBooker's PBA player profile",

The 1,100-megawatt natural gas-fired plant came online in 2020.\nThe CPV Valley Energy Center was one of the three natural gas-fired plants in the New York metropolitan area that came online to support electricity needs before the decommission of the last nuclear reactor of the Indian Point Energy Center in 2021. The other two plants were Bayonne Energy Center II (120 MW) and CPV Valley Energy Center (678 MW).\nIn 2022, Cricket Valley Energy Center retrofitted its combined cycle power plant as an early step to prepare for a conversion into a hydrogen fuel cell power plant.\n\n\n== History ==\nPursuant to Article 10 of the Public Service Law, Cricket Valley Energy Center LLC was granted a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to build a 1,000-megawatt (MW) combined cycle natural gas powered plant in 2013. An Article VII Certificate of Environmental Compatibility and Public Need was granted on April 20, 2016, to build 345-kV transmission lines to interconnect to the site. The 1,100-MW project went into service in April 2020. There are three combustion turbines whose exhaust creates steam to drive a steam turbine. All of the turbines are manufactured by General Electric. It uses an air-cooled condenser to reduce water draw. It is located on a 193-acre former industrial area, the former Mid-Hudson Recycling Center, which was destroyed in a massive 1996 fire. It is fueled by natural gas supplied from a trunk pipeline, one of many that are located along the east coast. Its power is sold into the electric wholesale market administered by the NYISO.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNYISO\nList of power stations in New York\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Televisión Universitaria Cochabamba is a Bolivian terrestrial television station owned by the Higher University of San Simón. The station is part of Red RUBI.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Higher University of San Simón's television station was the first local station to sign on in the city of Cochabamba, as TVB set up relays of the signal direct from La Paz. It was set up on December 19, 1975, as a closed-circuit educational television station using a 100-watt transmitter to broadcast. It was created by means of Rectoral Resolution No. 485/74 of March 26, 1978. Its first manager (from 1974) was Jorge Rivero Torrico. Torrico was replaced in 1978 by Luis Gonzales Quintanilla, who was in the position until 1980.\nOn September 20, 1976, the university's authorities requested Eng. Julio Trigo Méndez, Minister of Transport and Communications to operate a terrestrial television channel, as work for a closed-circuit service was economically unfeasible. On May 5, 1978, the terrestrial broadcast on channel 11 started with the broadcast of a soccer match that was made in association with Televisión Boliviana.\nIn its early years, 60% of its programming was of its own production. Such programs included “Maribel”, children's program directed by Maribel Pérez Beltrán; “Carlín, el estudioso” directed by Carlos Balderrama; “Curiosidades del ayer”, directed by Ramón Rocha Monroy and Elizabeth Marín; “Surcos de mi tierra”, directed by César Céspedes; “Mi escuela” presented by Nicolas Serrudo, with visits made to schools; “Vamos juventud”, directed by Ramón Rocha Monroy and presented by Henry Llanos; and “Movimiento Político”, led by Myrtha Fernández de Laserna. The station worked with the Portales Pedagogical and Cultural Center for the broadcast of “El Chasqui”, “Matemática moderna”, “Fiestas folklóricas”, “Caravana de artistas”, led by Hector Ramos; “The Ark of Hope”, presented by Raúl Guzmán; Toto Arévalo, Adolfo Mier Rivas and José Oropeza de los Llanos presented “Estudio 95”. “Deporte Total” had its first cycle on the channel, presented by Toto Arévalo.\nIn mid-1982, when unrestricted general amnesty was declared, Luis Gonzales returned from Mexico Quintanilla and made contact with Mexico's Televisa, to send content. The station bought its first two telenovelas, El Carruaje and La Colorina, as well as El Chavo del Ocho. In addition to those programs, a contract was signed with TV Globo for the carriage of its Spanish-dubbed catalog, with early titles including Pecado Capital, Dona Xepa and Dancin' Days. Transtel's catalog was also aired, especially its coverage of German soccer. The station also received many Bolivian artists and some from abroad. Plays and circus shows were recorded at the Achá Theater and other locations.\nThe station was a training school for professionals that later joined Bolivia TV, Red ATB and Bolivisión.\nIn May 2015, TVU briefly shut down due to problems with its staff, which was a target of constant aggressions from students.\nIn 2017, in line with the 39th anniversary of the station, plans were announced to convert its transmitting equipment to digital. Dr. César Cabrera was appointed as the new president of the channel.\nOn November 11, 2019, following the resignation of Evo Morales, students took over the TV station's facilities to demand the firing of Juan Rios, who had links to Morales.\nThe digital signal launched on October 12, 2023. The project cost over 4 million bolivianos.\n\n\n== References ==",

The club had been founded the year before by Irwin Severs and Larry Johnson. In 1992, the convention changed its name to WonderFest, and was held at a larger venue. Four years later, it relocated to its current home, the hotel Crowne Plaza, formerly Executive West. The convention formally split off from the hobbyist club after the 1997 show. The edition originally scheduled for May 30–31, 2020, and then October 24–25, 200, was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic.Guests throughout the years have included filmmakers / TV producers Joe Dante, D. C. Fontana, Nicholas Meyer, Greg Nicotero, and George Romero, genre-film actors and actresses Dirk Benedict, Martine Beswick, Veronica and Angela Cartwright, Joanna Cassidy, Yvonne Craig, Claudia Christian, Denise Crosby, Sybil Danning, Keir Dullea, Anne Francis, Marta Kristen, Gary Lockwood, Kevin McCarthy, Lee Meriwether, Caroline Munro, Robert Picardo, Linnea Quigley, and Brinke Stevens, special effects artists Ray Harryhausen, Tom Savini, and Chris Walas, comics and children's-book writers / artists Frank Cho, Basil Gogos, Joe Jusko, Michael Kaluta, Mark Schultz, William Stout, and Bernie Wrightson, and horror scions Sara Karloff and Vanessa Harryhausen.  It also features cosplayers.Events there include the annual presentation of the Rondo Hatton Classic Horror Awards and the WonderFest Model Contest, hosted by Amazing Figure Modeler magazine. Charitable outreach has included raffles to benefit the Pediatric AIDS Foundation and the WHAS Crusade for Children.In 2014, three Louisville, Kentucky-based podcasters attempted to set a Guinness World Record at WonderFest for the Longest Uninterrupted Webcast (now called now Longest Audio-Only Live Stream), Tower of Technobabble, to raise money for a local animal organization's spay and neuter program. They set the then-record of 41 hours.The CEO as of 2004 was Dave Hodge. As of 2022, its CEO was Melina Angstrom.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBickers, James (May 29, 2015). \"WonderFest Brings 'Walking Dead' Producer to Louisville\".

        "content": "The 2004–05 Swiss 1. Liga was the 73rd season of this league since its creation in 1931 and, at this time, it was the third tier of the Swiss football league system. The 1. Liga was also the highest level of Swiss amateur football, despite an ever-increasing number of clubs in this league playing with professional or, more often than not, semi-professional players in their ranks and this was not just the case with the U-21 teams of the professional clubs.\n\n\n== Format ==\nThere were 48 teams in this division, including seven U-21 teams, which were the eldest youth teams of the professional clubs in the Super League and the Challenge League. The 1. Liga was divided into three regional groups, each with 16 teams. Within each group, the teams would play a double round-robin to decide their positions in the league. The three group winners, the runners-up, together with the two best third placed teams, then contested a play-off for the two promotion slots. The U-21 teams were not eligible for promotion and could not compete in the play-offs. The two last placed teams in each group were to be directly relegated to the 2. Liga Interregional.\n\n\n== Group 1 ==\n\n\n=== Teams ===\n\n\n=== Final league table ===\n\n\n== Group 2 ==\n\n\n=== Teams ===\n\n\n=== Final league table ===\n\n\n== Group 3 ==\n\n\n=== Teams ===\n\n\n=== Final league table ===\n\n\n== Promotion play-off ==\nQualified for the play-offs were the first two teams from group 1; Lausanne-Sport and Serrières, from group 2; Biel-Bienne and Wangen b.O. and from group 3; Tuggen and Locarno. The two best third best teams were Étoile Carouge from group 1 and Red Star from group 3.\n\n\n=== Qualification round ===\n  Étoile Carouge win 3–1 on aggregate and advance to Finals.\n  Lausanne-Sport win 8–3 on aggregate and advance to Finals.\n  Locarno win 2–1 on aggregate and advance to Finals.\n  Red Star win 6–2 on aggregate and advance to Finals.\n\n\n=== Final round ===\n  Locarno win 4–1 on aggregate and are promoted to 2005–06 Challenge League.\n  Lausanne-Sport win 5–4 on aggregate and are promoted to 2005–06 Challenge League.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nGroup 1 champions were newly promoted Lausanne-Sport, they also achieved immediate promotion to the 2005–06 Challenge League. Runners-up in this group were Serrières, but they failed in their promotion attempt. Group 2 champions were Biel-Bienne and runners-up were Wangen b.O.. However, both failed in their promotion attempts. The champions of group 3, Tuggen, also missed promotion. The runners-up in group 3 were Locarno and they achieved promotion. Relegated were Malley and Stade Lausanne Ouchy from group 1, Alle and Langenthal from group 2 and from group 3 Chur and Gossau. The remaining teams in the division were to be joined in next season by Signal FC Bernex-Confignon, SC Düdingen, FC Kickers Luzern, SV Muttenz and FC Rapperswil-Jona, all of whom had won their 2.

In 1663 he, Francesco D'Andrea and others formed the Accademia degli Investiganti, which gave added impetus to the cultural renewal of southern Italy in the last decades of the 17th century. Its members like Valletta, D'Andrea, Tommaso Cornelio and Leonardo Di Capua actively supported the progressives in the heated philosophical-scientific debates of the time between progressives and conservatives. In 1681 he paid to found a chair in ancient Greek at the University of Naples, putting his own tutor and friend Gregorio Messere in charge of teaching. His nephew Francesco also became a scholar.\nIn 1687 he edited the Naples edition of Francesco Redi's Bacco in Toscana as well as Redi's complete works. He gathered a library of 18,000 books which became known as the Helluo librorum et Secli Peireskius alter. After Valletta's his death in Naples, Giambattista Vico's efforts ensured that the library was merged into the Biblioteca dei Girolamini.\n\n\n== Works ==\nLettera in difesa della moderna filosofia e de' coltivatori di essa, 1691.\nHistoria filosofica, 1697–1704.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n Media related to Giuseppe Valletta at Wikimedia Commons",

He attended both primary and secondary school at Drimnagh Castle CBS.Roche worked for four years as a clerical officer in Dublin County Council, before entering Holy Cross College in 1980 to study for the priesthood. He subsequently completed a Bachelor of Theology in St Patrick's College, Maynooth.Roche was ordained a priest for the Archdiocese of Dublin on 22 June 1986.\n\n\n== Presbyteral ministry ==\nFollowing ordination, Roche's first diocesan assignment was as a priest-teacher in Coláiste Dhúlaigh, Coolock. He was appointed diocesan advisor for religious education in primary schools in 1992, before his appointment five years later as chaplain to St Mark's Community School, Tallaght. During this period, Roche also spent six years as assistant diocesan vocations director.His first pastoral assignment was as curate in Lucan South parish, Lucan in 2005, before being appointed co-parish priest in Lucan South the following year.Roche was appointed administrator in Wicklow and Rathnew in 2012, during which time he was also appointed administrator in Kilbride, Barndarrig and Brittas Bay for a four-year period. In an interview with The Irish Catholic in 2022, he stated that while the local community had been \"very welcoming\" to newcomers, there was concern and anxiety over the recent influx of asylum seekers into Wicklow.Roche was subsequently appointed parish priest of Wicklow, Kilbride and Barndarrig in 2022. In another interview with The Irish Catholic in 2023 following the arrival of a large number of asylum seekers in Wicklow, he insisted that in spite of \"understandable\" concerns about housing and homelessness, Irish people were still welcoming towards asylum seekers, particularly when meeting them face-to-face.Roche was appointed moderator in Cabinteely and Johnstown-Killiney in 2023, with additional responsibility for the developing suburb of Cherrywood.In addition to his pastoral assignments, Roche has served as secretary to the diocesan council of priests since 2011.

His appointment will involve supporting the Archbishop of Dublin, Dermot Farrell, in his role of leading the archdiocese through the synod on synodality. Following his appointment, Roche commended the commitment and faith of both priests and laity in the archdiocese in \"challenging times\".In an interview with The Irish Catholic in March 2024, he opined that the Catholic Church must do more to reach out to young people suffering from anxiety, adding that the Easter message of Christ's victory over death is an opportunity to bring them a message of hope in a \"much more secular culture\" that was being greatly influenced by social media.Roche will be consecrated on 26 May in St Andrew's Church, Westland Row, Dublin.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFather Donal Roche on Catholic-Hierarchy.org\nBishop-elect Donal Roche on GCatholic",

His father worked for the noblewoman Maria Milano, who encouraged Egizio towards studying classics. He then studied law, the subject in which he graduated. From a young age he divided his time between private tuition and attending Giuseppe Valletta's library, editing its catalogue.\nHe then became tutor to Antonio Carmine Caracciolo, prince of Torella, simultaneously becoming known for his knowledge of antiquities, so much so that he was often called on to interpret ancient coins and inscriptions and compose new inscriptions. He corresponded with  Anton Francesco Gori, Scipione Maffei, Apostolo Zeno, Bernard de Montfaucon and other intellectuals of the era as well as joining Naples' Accademia degli Uniti and (with the pseudonym Timaste Pisandeo) Rome's Accademia dell'Arcadia and writing for the 'Giornale dei letterati'.\nHe moved in libertine and anticurialist circles but supported Naples' Bourbon rulers, leaving Naples after the Austrians' arrival in 1713 and moving to Amalfi. He later returned to live an isolated life in Naples, where he later died.\n\n\n== Works ==\nSerie degl'imperadori romani distesa da Matteo Egizio. Per maggior lume della storia ecclesiastica e per servire come di supplemento, o di correzione al mermoriale cronologico di G.

        "content": "The Whole Earth Center is a non-profit organic food grocery store and restaurant in Princeton, NJ with an unusual business structure.\n\n\n== Board-governed non-profit that earns money ==\nBy virtue of its by-laws and its type of incorporation, it is owned by a non-profit organization and governed by a board, but the government does not recognize the store as a 501(c)(3) because it earns money from sales, and thus it pays taxes like a normal corporation.  However, 100% of its earnings are invested in furthering its mission \"to foster sustainable organic farming, grow the organic marketplace, and support efforts that positively impact the food industry and empower consumers to make healthy, informed choices.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was founded in April of 1970, the same year as the first Earth Day, to provide healthy, sustainable food choices and to raise funds to reduce harmful impacts on the environment. The founders were five women (Barbara Parmet, Florence Falk, Margot Sutherland, Hella McVay, and Susy Waterman) who raised $4,500 in a door-to-door, child-in-tow, funding campaign that enabled them purchase the center's initial stock of bulk foods.\n\n\n== Unique aspects among local groceries ==\nThe store's produce is 100% organic and, if possible, locally sourced within a 150-mile radius. The store carries hundreds of bulk items to reduce packaging waste, there is an in-house bakery, and a small but popular sit-down, self-serve restaurant serving only gluten-free, vegetarian prepared foods (and in summer, tables and benches outside the store provide an expansion to the eatery).\n\n\n== Support for healthy living and environmental preservation ==\nIn addition to the store, the non-profit organization helps sponsor events for healthy eating and environmental preservation, including in-store discussion groups on healthy living, Bike to Work Week, the annual Princeton Environmental Film Festival, Princeton School Gardens Cooperative, The Suppers Program (now rebranded as \"Eating for your Health\"), The Town Topics newspaper, and the Trenton Area Soup Kitchen. The non-profit also supports the local environment by donating to, and working closely with, organizations such as the D&R Greenway and Friends of Herrontown Woods.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe Whole Earth Center store is located at 360 Nassau Street near the intersection with Harrison Street. Its parking lot can also be accessed and exited on North Harrison Street via two one-way alleys on either side of a doctor's office building (very near the intersection with Nassau Street).\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nBulk foods\nOrganic food culture\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nYelp profile",

        "content": "Walther von Mezze was German lyric poet in the Minnesang tradition, probably active in the first half of the 13th century.\nWalther was probably born in the late 12th century. It cannot be proved that he was related to the lords of Metze who held lands in southern Tyrol and the Rhenish Palatinate, since his given name is never attested among them in the 13th century. His coat of arms, as shown in the Codex Manesse, does not narrow down his origins, for in the Weingarten Manuscript the same arms are attributed to the poet Rubin. His portrait is a notable example of the tendency by the later 13th century to cover all of a knight's accoutrements in his coat of arms. Besides his painted shield, his cloth tabard, caparison and banner all bear the same patter. Walther is mentioned as deceased in a poem by Reinmar von Brennenberg, who himself died in 1276.\nWalther's songs are preserved in two codices, the aforementioned Codex Manesse with 31 strophes and ten melodies and the Kleine Heidelberger Liederhandschrift with 16 strophes and eight melodies. The codices have ten stanzas and four melodies in common. Several works attributed to Walther in these books are attributed to others elsewhere. Their authenticity is uncertain. Those that can be securely attributed to Walther von Mezze are in the courtly love tradition and mostly concerned with wooing ladies and lamenting unrequited love. His highest inspiration is Walther von der Vogelweide. Nevertheless, he is one of the more individual of Vogelweide's followers and Carl von Kraus reckoned his poems among the best of that generation. An example of Walther's verse, from Olive Sayce:\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nWilhelm Wilmanns, \"Walther von Mezze\", Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, Vol. 21 (1885), p. 529.",

        "content": "The illegal drug trade in Azerbaijan represents a significant challenge to the nation's social, economic, and political stability. Situated at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, Azerbaijan's strategic location has made it a transit point for narcotics trafficking between regions. Despite efforts to combat this illicit activity, the illegal drug trade continues to thrive, fueling addiction, organized crime, and corruption within Azerbaijani society.\n\n\n== History ==\nAzerbaijan's historical significance as a trade route has contributed to its vulnerability to the transit of illicit substances. From ancient times to the present day, the country has served as a conduit for the trafficking of drugs such as heroin, opium, cannabis, and synthetic substances. The dissolution of the Soviet Union and the subsequent emergence of independent states in the region further exacerbated the challenges posed by the illegal drug trade.\nThe illegal drug trade in Azerbaijan is facilitated by its extensive borders with neighboring countries, including Iran and Russia. Traffickers exploit these porous borders to transport narcotics, often utilizing sophisticated smuggling networks and bribery of law enforcement officials. Criminal organizations, with connections both domestically and internationally, perpetuate the trade, contributing to corruption and undermining governance.\nIn 2022, 7 Azerbaijani border guards were arrested for their role in a drug trafficking scheme.\n\n\n== Responses ==\nAzerbaijan has implemented legislative measures, law enforcement initiatives, and international partnerships to combat the illegal drug trade. Efforts to strengthen border security, enhance enforcement capabilities, and promote regional cooperation are ongoing, albeit with mixed results. Additionally, investment in drug prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation programs aims to address the root causes of substance abuse and reduce demand for illicit substances.\n\n\n== References ==",

His parents were Robert Scott and Olive Elizabeth (Glass) Misener. He attended the Sarnia Collegiate Institute and Technical School and the University of Western Ontario and was a member of the football team at both schools. In 1934, Misener moved to Winnipeg to work for his family's shipping business – Consolidated Shipping. During World War II, he began working for another family company – Scott Misener Steamships.\nMisener was president of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers from 1950 to 1951 and again from 1954 to 1955. He was a founder of the Winnipeg Enterprises Corporation, a non-profit which constructed, owned, and operated Winnipeg Stadium and Winnipeg Arena. From 1958 to 1962, he served as the organization's president. In 1956, Misener helped lead an unsuccessful effort to get Sarnia a franchise in the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union.\nIn 1960, the Board of Broadcast Governors granted the licences for Canada's first privately owned and Misener was awarded the licence for Winnipeg. CJAY-TV launched on November 12, 1960. In 1961, he was elected president of the Independent Television Organization, a liaison body for the county's eight independent television stations. In 1973, one of Misener's partners, Moffat Communications, acquired full control of the station.\nHe became the president of Scott Misener Steamships following his father's death in 1963. In 1968, the company launched the M. V. Ralph Misener, the world's largest lake freighter. That same year, he moved to St. Catharines. His son, Scott A. Misener, took over as president in 1978, but Misener remained involved with the business, which was renamed Misener Transportation in 1978, through the 1980s. It was sold in 1994.\nMisener also served as a director of Trans-Canada Air Lines and Saint Boniface Hospital and president of the Canadian National Institute for the Blind and the Dominion Marine Association. In 1980, he chaired the Seaway Task Force, a committee formed by the government of Ontario to recommend changes to marine transportation policy. From 1980 to 1985, he was chancellor of Brock University.\nMisener died on February 16, 1997, at his home in St. Catharines.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Illegal drug trade in Armenia presents a significant challenge to the nation's social and economic well-being. Despite its rich cultural history and relatively low profile on the global stage, Armenia is not immune to the pervasive influence of narcotics. Beneath its serene exterior lies a complex network of traffickers, dealers, and users, perpetuating a cycle of clandestine activities and societal disruption.\n\n\n= Background =\nArmenia's strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia has historically rendered it susceptible to the transit of illicit substances. From ancient trade routes like the Silk Road to modern smuggling operations, the nation has served as a conduit for the trafficking of drugs, including heroin, opium, cannabis, and synthetic substances.\nThe illegal drug trade in Armenia is facilitated by its porous borders with neighboring countries, particularly Iran and Turkey. Traffickers exploit these channels to transport narcotics, often leveraging corruption and violence to protect their operations. Criminal syndicates with transnational reach exacerbate enforcement challenges, further entrenching the trade within Armenian society.\nThe proliferation of illicit drugs poses multifaceted challenges to Armenian society, ranging from public health crises to socioeconomic destabilization. Addiction and substance abuse strain public health systems and perpetuate cycles of poverty and vulnerability. Moreover, the nexus between drug trafficking and organized crime undermines governance and security, threatening societal cohesion.\n\n\n= Responses =\nArmenia has implemented legislative measures, law enforcement initiatives, and public health interventions to combat the illegal drug trade. Efforts to strengthen border security, enhance enforcement capabilities, and promote international cooperation are underway, albeit constrained by resource limitations and systemic challenges. Additionally, investment in prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation programs aims to mitigate the demand for illicit substances.\n\n\n= References =",

Mexico and numerous other countries decried the raid as a violation of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the 1954 Caracas Convention on Diplomatic Asylum.\nThe raid was carried out to arrest the former vice president of Ecuador, Jorge Glas, who had been sentenced for corruption and had been living in the embassy since 17 December 2023. A few hours before the attack, he had been granted political asylum.\nThe assault led to Mexico severing its relations with Ecuador. The following day, Nicaragua followed suit in solidarity with Mexico. Venezuela closed its Ecuadorian embassy and consulates due to the raid, condemning Ecuador's actions.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nIn December 2023, former Ecuadorian vice president Jorge Glas, who had served as vice president under presidents Rafael Correa and Lenín Moreno, entered the Mexican embassy in Quito to request asylum, alleging political persecution. The former vice president had been sentenced in December 2017 to serve eight years in prison for two sentences: one of six years for illicit association and another of eight years for bribery. In November 2022, Glas was released but could not leave the country during the remainder of his sentences. The attorney general's office then said it was insisting on charging Glas with respect to the case involving public funds collected to aid the reconstruction of Manabí Province after a 2016 earthquake.\nOn 3 April 2024, the president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, alluded in a press conference to the fact that Luisa González, the presidential candidate of the pro-Correa Citizen Revolution Movement, had an advantage in polling for the 2023 Ecuadorian general election, but that after the murder of Fernando Villavicencio her polling numbers had dropped, implying the assassination had affected the election results.\nAfter the president's comments, on 4 April, Mexican ambassador Raquel Serur Smeke was declared a persona non grata and the Ecuadorian Foreign Ministry invoked the principle of \"non-intervention\" in the internal affairs of another country and Article 9 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations to request her departure. The Mexican government granted political asylum to Glas after the expulsion of its ambassador. Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa reiterated that he would not issue the necessary safe conduct for Glas to leave the country.\nOn 5 April, the Mexican secretary of foreign affairs, Alicia Bárcena, called for the government of Ecuador to arrange safe passage as soon as possible so that Glas could leave for Mexico.\n\n\n== Raid ==\nAt around 22:00 on 5 April, an elite detachment of the National Police of Ecuador forced their way into the embassy and took Glas into custody. They possessed a battering ram, and at least one agent climbed the walls. They took Glas to the attorney general's office, then to an airport for a flight to Guayaquil, with plans to transfer him to a maximum security facility. Glas's attorney said that police kicked his client multiple times while Glas was resisting arrest, and dragged him out of the embassy. Mexican foreign minister Alicia Bárcena said that some of their diplomats were injured during the raid. Police also pointed a gun at the embassy's acting head, Roberto Canseco, when he tried to block their path.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Government positions ==\n\n\n=== Ecuador ===\nCommenting on the raid, President Noboa said he made \"exceptional decisions to protect national security, the rule of law and the dignity of a population that rejects any type of impunity for criminals, corrupt people or narco-terrorists\", and that he would \"not allow sentenced criminals involved in very serious crimes to be given asylum\", arguing that such actions were against the Vienna Convention and other international agreements. Noboa later said that wished to resolve the diplomatic issue with Mexico, but added that \"justice is not negotiated\" and that \"we will never protect criminals who have harmed Mexicans\". Foreign minister Gabriela Sommerfeld defended the raid, saying that the decision was made by Noboa after the government had determined an \"imminent flight risk\" on the part of Glas and after it had exhausted all possibilities for diplomatic dialogue with Mexico. She added that it was not \"legal to grant asylum to people convicted of common crimes and by competent courts\".\n\n\n=== Mexico ===\nImmediately following the raid, Roberto Canseco, head of the embassy's consular section and acting head of mission, called the incident \"crazy\" and expressed concern over Glas's life. After the news spread of the raid, on the same day, President López Obrador announced on X (Twitter) the severing of all diplomatic relations with Ecuador. Mexico also announced plans to take Ecuador to the International Court of Justice for violations of international law. It also said there were no plans to expel Ecuadorean diplomats from Mexico City.\nOn 9 April, the Mexican foreign ministry released footage of the raid. Foreign minister Alicia Bárcena praised the embassy staff, who returned to Mexico following the raid, for \"the defence they made of our sovereignty\".\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nGlas's attorney, Sonia Vera, said that she and other members of his defense team were not allowed to speak with Glas while he was at the prosecutor's office in Guayaquil, and said that they were filing a petition for habeas corpus. Vera also expressed concern that \"something could happen\" to Glas in custody. As Glas left the prosecutor's office, people gathered outside chanted \"strength\".\nOn 9 April, prison authorities said that Glas had been hospitalized in the Guayaquil naval hospital after not eating for 24 hours, adding that his condition was stable. He was returned to prison shortly afterwards but began a hunger strike on 10 April. On 12 April, a three-person tribunal ruled that his arrest was \"illegal and arbitrary\" due to lack of \"authorisation from the head of the Foreign Ministry and political affairs\" at the embassy, but upheld his imprisonment, saying that it could not \"modify the sentence\" for his previous convictions.\nAt the request of the delegations of Colombia and Ecuador, the Permanent Council of the Organization of American States met on 9 and 10 April to discuss the raid and its implications. On 10 April, by a near unanimous vote (Ecuador voted against, El Salvador abstained, and Mexico was absent), the Permanent Council adopted a resolution \"strongly condemn[ing] the intrusion into the premises of the Embassy of Mexico in Ecuador and the acts of violence against the well-being and dignity of the diplomatic personnel of the mission\".\nA special meeting of the foreign ministers of the member states of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) was also held on 9 April. Mexico's Alicia Bárcena sought backing from the other countries for the planned filing of an action at the International Court of Justice, and consideration was given to a summit of the bloc's heads of state and government. Ecuador's Gabriela Sommerfeld also addressed the meeting, arguing her country's position and describing the granting of asylum to Glas as \"a provocation\".\nOn 11 April, Mexico filed an application instituting proceedings against Ecuador at the International Court of Justice. In the application, Mexico requested provisional measures to protect the integrity of the abandoned embassy and that Ecuador's membership in the United Nations be suspended until a public apology is given.\nOn 15 April, Mexican Deputy Gerardo Fernández Noroña lodged a formal complaint against President Noboa with the Attorney General of Mexico and sought to have him extradited for the raid on the embassy. The Attorney General's office received the complaint but did not comment.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\n\n\n=== International ===\nThe embassy raid provoked what The Guardian newspaper described as \"an unusually intense outpouring of outrage from across the political spectrum in Latin America\". \n\n Argentina: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International Trade, and Worship condemned the attack and called for full observance of the 1954 Convention on Diplomatic Asylum and the 1961 Convention on Diplomatic Relations.\n Brazil: The foreign ministry released a statement condemning the raid \"in the strongest terms\", highlighting that it was a violation of the American Convention on Diplomatic Asylum and the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. It also stated that Ecuadorean government's actions \"constitutes a serious precedent\" and should be repudiated.\n Chile: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the raid and recalled the 1961 Convention on Diplomatic Relations. It also urged Ecuador and Mexico to \"promptly overcome\" their dispute.\n Colombia: President Gustavo Petro announced that he will request precautionary measures in favor of Glas from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and will also call an emergency meeting of the Organization of American States to examine Ecuador's breach of the Vienna Convention.\n Nicaragua: The government condemned the violation of international law, severed its diplomatic relations with the Ecuadorian government, and expressed its solidarity with Mexico.\n United States: The State Department condemned any violation of the Vienna Convention and called on Ecuador and Mexico to resolve their dispute.\n Uruguay: The Ministry of Foreign Relations issued a statement in which it expressed its regret over the events and called for full observance of the Caracas Convention, highlighting that diplomatic asylum should not be granted in cases of common crimes.\n Venezuela: On 16 April, President Nicolás Maduro announced in an X post the closure of both its embassy and its consulates in Quito and Guayaquil as well for its \"diplomatic personnel to return to Venezuela immediately\". In another post, Maduro expressed its utmost solidarity with Mexico, stating \"You are not alone, you have the voice of our America.\"\n\n\n=== Supranational ===\nThe incident was also condemned by a number of international organizations and supranational bodies.\n\n European Union: The bloc condemned the assault and emphasized the importance of respecting the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations between states. EU spokesperson Peter Stano said that any violation of diplomatic mission premises is a breach of the Vienna Convention and must be rejected. The EU stressed that safeguarding diplomatic missions' integrity and personnel is crucial for international stability and cooperation, echoing the sentiments of EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, who called for respect for international diplomatic law.\n Organization of American States: The regional body rejected the police incursion into the embassy and its Permanent Council adopted a resolution strongly condemned the intrusion; it also called for dialogue between both parties and expressed its solidarity with the Mexican diplomats. The OAS's Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) also expressed its concern and called on Ecuador to adopt all measures necessary to protect Glas's rights to life and personal integrity.\n United Nations: Spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said that Secretary-General António Guterres was \"alarmed\" at the incident and reaffirmed the cardinal principle of the inviolability of diplomatic and consular premises and personnel. Guterres also called for moderation and exhorted the two countries to solve their differences peacefully.\n\n\n== See also ==\nJulian Assange § Ecuadorian embassy period\nList of attacks on diplomatic missions\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ulhas (born M N Kaul; 1913 – 14 July 1969) was an Indian actor, who played character roles in Hindi cinema from the late 1930s to the early 1980s. However, since he died in 1969, many of his films were released after his death.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nUlhas was born as M N Kaul at Ajmer in a Kashmiri Pandit family in the year 1913 to Chand Bahadur Kaul, who in turn was the brother of Kamla Nehru. This makes Ulhas, the first cousin of Indira Gandhi who was the third Prime Minister of India. He was also distantly related to actor Prem Adib. After completing his formal education, Ulhas left for Poona with the help of Prem Adib to try his luck in the Hindi film industry.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nUlhas came to Poona in search of work in 1935. After the initial struggle, he soon got his first film titled Wahan, with the help of fellow actor Chandra Mohan, who also happened to be another Kashmiri Pandit. Wahan was being made under the banner of Prabhat Film Company headed by V. Shantaram and directed by K Narayan Kale. Ulhas came into prominence with Basant (1942) in which he was cast opposite Mumtaz Shanti. Coincidentally, another Mumtaz was signed in the film who played the role of Ulhas's daughter. This Mumtaz went on to become legendary actress Madhubala.\nEven after being cast as the leading hero, Ulhas continued playing supporting roles. Some of his prominent films are Parbat Pe Apna Dera, Do Bhai, Jhansi Ki Rani, Laila Majnu, Amar, Nastik, Mirza Ghalib and Kundan. For his performance in Kundan, he was also nominated in the Best Supporting Actor category at the 3rd Filmfare Awards. A regular feature in V. Shantaram's films, he appeared in Dr. Kotnis Ki Amar Kahani, Dahej, Surang, Do Aankhen Barah Haath, Navrang and Sehra. His filmography also has films like Guide, Sunghursh, Prince, Prem Pujari and Heer Ranjha.\n\n\n== Death ==\nUlhas died in 1969 when many of his films were pending for their release. The film Prem Pujari refers to him as \"Late Ulhas\" in its credits. Ulhas's final film was Sawaal which released almost 13 years after his untimely death.\n\n\n== Accolades ==\nFor his work in Kundan, Ulhas was nominated for Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor; it was the only nomination he ever received.\n\n\n== Selected filmography ==\nUlhas appeared in more than a hundred films, some of which are listed below\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nUlhas at IMDb\n3rd Filmfare awards",

        "title": "Valkey",
        "revision_id": 1219432520,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Valkey is an open-source in-memory storage, used as a distributed, in-memory key–value database, cache and message broker, with optional durability. Because it holds all data in memory and because of its design, Valkey offers low-latency reads and writes, making it particularly suitable for use cases that require a cache. Valkey is the successor to Redis, the most popular NoSQL database, and one of the most popular databases overall. Valkey or its predecessor Redis are used in companies like Twitter, Airbnb, Tinder, Yahoo, Adobe, Hulu, Amazon and OpenAI.\nValkey supports different kinds of abstract data structures, such as strings, lists, maps, sets, sorted sets, HyperLogLogs, bitmaps, streams, and spatial indices.\nThe project was developed and maintained by Salvatore Sanfilippo, starting in 2009. From 2015 until 2020, he led a project core team sponsored by Redis Labs.\nIn 2018, Redis Ltd., the company managing Redis development, licensed some modules under the proprietary SSPL.  In 2024, the company suddenly switched its main Redis code from the BSD license to proprietary licenses.  This prompted a large portion of the user and developer community to fork the code under the new name Valkey, retaining the BSD license.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe original name Redis meant Remote Dictionary Server. The Redis project began when Salvatore Sanfilippo, nicknamed antirez, the original developer of Redis, was trying to improve the scalability of his Italian startup, developing a real-time web log analyzer. After encountering significant problems in scaling some types of workloads using traditional database systems, Sanfilippo began in 2009 to prototype a first proof of concept version of Redis in Tcl. Later Sanfilippo translated that prototype to the C language and implemented the first data type, the list. After a few weeks of using the project internally with success, Sanfilippo decided to open source it, announcing the project on Hacker News. The project began to get traction, particularly among the Ruby community, with GitHub and Instagram being among the first companies adopting it.\nSanfilippo was hired by VMware in March, 2010.\nIn May, 2013, Redis was sponsored by Pivotal Software (a VMware spin-off).\nIn June 2015, development became sponsored by Redis Labs.\nIn August 2018, Redis Labs announced the switch to a proprietary source-available software license, Server Side Public License. Initially the change was said to affect only some optional modules primarily developed by Redis Labs.\nIn October 2018, Redis 5.0 was released, introducing Redis Stream – a new data structure that allows storage of multiple fields and string values with an automatic, time-based sequence at a single key.\nIn June 2020, Salvatore Sanfilippo stepped down as Redis' sole maintainer. Sanfilippo was succeeded by Yossi Gottlieb and Oran Agra.\nIn 2024, the Linux Foundation created a fork of Redis under the name of Valkey, allowing community maintainers, contributors, and users to continue working on an open source version of the Redis database. This was in response to the Redis company having switched to fully proprietary software licenses for its core repository.\n\n\n== Differences from other database systems ==\nValkey and Redis popularized the idea of a system that can be considered a store and a cache at the same time. It was designed so that data is always modified and read from the main computer memory, but also stored on disk in a format that is unsuitable for random data access. The formatted data is only reconstructed into memory once the system restarts.\nValkey also provides a data model that is very unusual compared to a relational database management system (RDBMS). User commands do not describe a query to be executed by the database engine but rather specific operations that are performed on given abstract data types. Therefore, data must be stored in a way which is suitable later for fast retrieval. The retrieval is done without help from the database system in form of secondary indexes, aggregations or other common features of traditional RDBMS. The Valkey implementation makes heavy use of the fork system call, to duplicate the process holding the data, so that the parent process continues to serve clients while the child process writes the in-memory data to disk.\n\n\n== Popularity ==\nAccording to monthly DB-Engines rankings, Valkey or its predecessor Redis are often the most popular key–value databases. Redis was ranked the #4 NoSQL database in user satisfaction and market presence based on user reviews, the most popular NoSQL database in containers, and the #4 Data store of 2019 by ranking website stackshare.io. It was voted most loved database in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021.\n\n\n== Supported languages ==\nSince version 2.6 of Redis, Valkey featured server-side scripting in the language Lua.\nMany programming languages have Redis or Valkey language bindings on the client side, including: ActionScript, C, C++, C#, Chicken, Clojure, Common Lisp, Crystal, D, Dart, Delphi, Elixir, Erlang, Go, Haskell, Haxe, Io, Java, Nim, JavaScript (Node.js), Julia, Lua, Objective-C, OCaml, Perl, PHP, Pure Data, Python, R, Racket, Ruby, Rust, Scala, Smalltalk, Swift, and Tcl. Several client software programs exist in these languages.\n\n\n== Data types ==\nValkey and Redis map keys to types of values. An important difference between these and other structured storage systems is that they support not only strings, but also abstract data types:\n\nLists of strings\nSets of strings (collections of non-repeating unsorted elements)\nSorted sets of strings (collections of non-repeating elements ordered by a floating-point number called score)\nHash tables where keys and values are strings\nHyperLogLogs used for approximated set cardinality size estimation, available since Redis 2.8.9 in April 2014.\nStream of entries with consumer groups, allows you to store multiple fields and string values with an automatic, time-based sequence at a single key, available since Redis 5.0 in October 2018\nGeospatial data through the implementation of the geohash technique, available since Redis 3.2.\nThe type of a value determines what operations (called commands) are available for the value. Redis supports high-level, atomic, server-side operations like intersection, union, and difference between sets and sorting of lists, sets and sorted sets.\nSome other data types are supported based on the Redis Modules API. Some of them are not licensed under the BSD license used by Valkey:\n\nJSON – RedisJSON implements ECMA-404 (the JavaScript Object Notation Data Interchange Standard) as a native data type.\nSearch - A query engine for Redis, providing secondary indexing, full-text search, vector similarity search and aggregations.\nTime series – RedisTimeSeries implements a time series data structure\nBloom filter, Cuckoo filter, Count–min sketch, and Top-K – RedisBloom implements a set of probabilistic data structures for Redis\nOthers \nFormer implementations include:\n\nGraph – RedisGraph implements a queryable property graph\nRedisGraph has been discontinued, and continued in the form of a fork called FalkorDB.\n\n\n== Persistence ==\nValkey and Redis typically hold the whole dataset in memory. Versions up to 2.4 could be configured to use what they refer to as virtual memory in which some of the dataset is stored on disk, but this feature is deprecated. Persistence in Valkey can be achieved through two different methods. First by snapshotting, where the dataset is asynchronously transferred from memory to disk at regular intervals as a binary dump, using the Redis RDB Dump File Format. Alternatively by journaling, where a record of each operation that modifies the dataset is added to an append-only file (AOF) in a background process. Valkey can rewrite the append-only file in the background to avoid an indefinite growth of the journal. Journaling was introduced in version 1.1 and is generally considered the safer approach.\nBy default, Valkey writes data to a file system at least every 2 seconds, with more or less robust options available if needed. In the case of a complete system failure on default settings, only a few seconds of data would be lost.\n\n\n== Replication ==\nValkey supports master–replica replication. Data from any Valkey server can replicate to any number of replicas. A replica may be a master to another replica. This allows Valkey to implement a single-rooted replication tree. Replicas can be configured to accept writes, permitting intentional and unintentional inconsistency between instances. The publish–subscribe feature is fully implemented, so a client of a replica may subscribe to a channel and receive a full feed of messages published to the master, anywhere up the replication tree. Replication is useful for read (but not write) scalability or data redundancy.\n\n\n== Performance ==\nWhen the durability of data is not needed, the in-memory nature of Valkey allows it to perform well compared to database systems that write every change to disk before considering a transaction committed. Valkey operates as a single process and is single-threaded or double-threaded when it rewrites the AOF (append-only file). Thus, a single Valkey instance cannot use parallel execution of tasks such as stored procedures.\n\n\n== Clustering ==\nValkey introduced clustering in April 2015 with the release of Redis version 3.0. The cluster specification implements a subset of Valkey commands: all single-key commands are available, multi-key operations (commands related to unions and intersections) are restricted to keys belonging to the same node, and commands related to database selection operations are unavailable. A Valkey cluster can scale up to 1,000 nodes, achieve \"acceptable\" write safety and to continue operations when some nodes fail.\n\n\n== Use cases ==\nDue to the nature of the database design, typical use cases are session caching, full page cache, message queue applications, leaderboards and counting among others. The publish–subscribe messaging paradigm allows real-time communication between servers.\nAmazon Web Services offers a managed Redis service called ElastiCache for Redis, Google offers a managed Redis service called Cloud Memorystore, Microsoft offers Azure Cache for Redis in Azure, and Alibaba offers ApsaraDB for Redis in Alibaba Cloud.  Most of these services have announced that they will transition to Valkey.\n\n\n== Users ==\nValkey or Redis are being used in companies like Twitter, AirBnB, Tinder, Yahoo, Adobe, Hulu, and Amazon.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nConflict-free replicated data type\nMemcached\nInfinispan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Florida Amendment 4 is a proposed amendment to the Florida Constitution that will be subject to a referendum in November 2024. The amendment would establish a constitutional right to abortion before fetal viability (generally considered to be between 23 and 24 weeks gestational age). A 60% supermajority vote is required for the amendment to be approved.\n\n\n== Content ==\nThe ballot summary for the amendment states:\n\nNo law shall prohibit, penalize, delay, or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient's health, as determined by the patient’s healthcare provider. This amendment does not change the Legislature’s constitutional authority to require notification to a parent or guardian before a minor has an abortion.\nIf approved, the initiative would add the following text to Article I of the Florida Constitution:\n\nExcept as provided in Article X, Section 22, no law shall prohibit, penalize, delay, or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient’s health, as determined by the patient’s healthcare provider.\n\n\n== Legal challenges ==\nFlorida Attorney General Ashley Moody, a Republican, has opposed the ballot initiative since October 2023, when she asked the Florida Supreme Court to analyse the ballot initiative. In November 2023, Moody urged the Florida Supreme Court to block the ballot initiative, as she questioned the definition of \"viability\" and argued that the ballot initiative will \"lay ticking time bombs that will enable abortion proponents later to argue that the amendment has a much broader meaning than voters would ever have thought\".\nThe Florida Supreme Court in April 2024 approved Florida Amendment 4 to be placed on the ballot for voting in November 2024, because it adequately satisfied the requirements set.  Despite Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody arguing that some of the language was deceptive, the Florida Supreme Court instead ruled that \"it cannot be said that the ballot summary will mislead voters regarding the actual text of the proposed amendment.\" The Florida Supreme Court further stated that \"the broad sweep of this proposed amendment is obvious in the language of the summary. Denying this requires a flight from reality\", while ruling that there is \"no basis for concluding that the proposed amendment is facially invalid under the United States Constitution.\"\n\n\n== Support and opposition ==\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis in April 2024 criticized Florida Amendment 4 as \"radical\" and \"very, very extreme\". Florida State Senator Shevrin Jones supported the amendment, stating \"Abortion IS healthcare, and every Floridian should be able to access the care they need without government interference.\"\n\n\n== Polling ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAdvisory Opinion to the Attorney General re: Limiting Government Interference with Abortion – issued April 1, 2024 by the Supreme Court of Florida",

        "content": "The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, officially the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, is the provincial committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Jiangsu Province. The committee secretary is the highest ranking post in the province. The current secretary is Xin Changxing, who succeeded Wu Zhenglong on 3 January 2023.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn early 1927, Congress of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Districts was held, and the CCP established the Jiangsu District Committee of the CCP. In early June 1927, the District Committee was abolished and replaced with the Jiangsu Provincial Committee. On 2 July 1927, the committee faced heavy losses due to betrayal, leading to its abolition and the establishment of the Jiangsu Provisional Provincial Committee in its place. From 11 to 26 November 1929, the Second Jiangsu Provincial Congress secretly held in Shanghai, and the Jiangsu Provincial Committee was restructured to the Jiangnan Provincial Committee in early October 1930. In January 1931, the Jiangsu Provincial Committee was reestablished. However, due to repeated arrests, the provincial committee was forced to cease activities in early January 1935.\nIn early November 1937, the Jiangsu Provincial Committee was reestablished in Shanghai with Liu Xiao as its secretary. In early 1938, the Provincial Committee established an Outer County Working Committee in Pudong to organize anti-Japanese forces. On 13 January 1943, the CCP Secretariat decided to abolish the provincial committee and establish an enemy area work department in the Central China Bureau in its place. After the proclamation of the People's Republic of China on 1 October 1949, the Jiangsu Province was divided into south Jiangsu and north Jiangsu administrative regions. After the administrative regions were abolished in 1952, Jiangsu Provincial Committee was reestablished in November 1952, becoming the highest political force of the province.\nIn January 1967, during the Cultural Revolution, the provincial committee was overthrown. In March 1967, the central government decided to establish military rule in the province, and a revolutionary committee was established in March 1968. In December 1970, the Jiangsu Provincial Committee was reestablished and reorganized to work along with the revolutionary committee. The two institutions began to separate in November 1974.\n\n\n== Organization ==\nThe organization of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee includes:\n\nGeneral Office\n\n\n=== Functional Departments ===\n\n\n=== Offices ===\n\n\n=== Dispatched institutions ===\nWorking Committee of the Organs Directly Affiliated to the Jiangsu Provincial Committee\n\n\n=== Organizations directly under the Committee ===\n\n\n== Leadership ==\n\n\n=== Party Secretary ===\n\n\n=== Party Committees ===\n14th Provincial Party Committee (November 2016 – November 2021)\n\nSecretary: Li Qiang (until 29 October 2017), Lou Qinjian (29 October 2017 – 19 October 2021), Wu Zhenglong (until 19 October 2021)\nDeputy Secretaries: Shi Taifeng (until April 2017), Wu Zhenglong (until October 2021), Huang Lixin (July 2017 – March 2018), Ren Zhenhe (July 2019 – December 2020), Zhang Jinghua (February 2021 – November 2021), Xu Kunlin (from October 2021), Zhang Yizhen (from November 2021)\nOther Standing Committee members: Huang Lixin (until March 2018), Yang Yue, Li Xiaomin (until July 2019), Wang Jiong (until May 2017), Fan Jinlong, Wang Yanwen (until June 2020), Jiang Zhuoqing (until December 2019), Wang Like (until October 2020), Zhou Naixiang (until September 2019), Guo Wenqi (May 2017 – December 2020), Zhang Jinghua (July 2017 – November 2021), Meng Zhongkang (January 2018 – September 2019, put under investigation), Lan Shaomin (September 2019 – September 2020), Guo Yuanqiang (October 2019 – September 2021), Zhang Lihong (from February 2020), Wang Changsong (from March 2020), Xu Kunlin (from September 2020), Zhang Aijun (from October 2020), Fei Gaoyun (from January 2021), Han Liming (from April 2021), Zhao Shiyong (from April 2021), Zhang Yizhen (from November 2021), Deng Xiuming (from November 2021)\n15th Provincial Party Committee (November 2021–)\n\nSecretary: Wu Zhenglong (until 28 December 2022), Xin Changxing (from 3 January 2023)\nDeputy Secretaries: Xu Kunlin, Zhang Yizhen (until January 2022), Deng Xiuming (July 2022 – July 2023), Shen Ying (from November 2023)\nOther Standing Committee members: Wang Changsong (until July 2023), Deng Xiuming (until July 2023), Zhang Aijun (until April 2024), Fei Gaoyun (until December 2022), Han Liming, Zhao Shiyong (until October 2022), Hui Jianlin, Pan Xianzhang (until August 2022), Cao Lubao (until October 2023), Chu Yonghong (from September 2022), Shen Ying (from December 2022), Liu Jianyang (from December 2022), Ma Xin (from January 2023), Zhang Guocheng (from April 2023), Zhang Zhong (from July 2023), Liu Xiaotao (from October 2023)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Raghunandan Yandamuri (born 21 February 1986) is an Indian citizen, murderer, and kidnapper, who is currently awaiting execution on death row in the U.S. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, at SCI Somerset, as of 2024. On 20 November 2014, he was sentenced to death for the 22 October 2012 murder of 61-year-old Satyavathi Venna and the kidnapping-murder of her 10-month-old granddaughter, Saanvi Venna, at an Upper Merion Township apartment in Montgomery County. He was previously scheduled for execution by lethal injection on 23 February 2018, at age 32, but it was halted due to the 2015 moratorium of the death penalty in Pennsylvania.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nNot much is known about Yandamuri's personal life. He is a citizen of India and a native to the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. He's also known to hold an advanced degree in electrical and computer science engineering.\n\n\n== Background ==\nTwo days prior to the murders and kidnapping, Yandamuri attended a next-door birthday party along with his wife, at the Marquis Apartments in King of Prussia. One of the murder victims, 10-month-old Saanvi Venna, along with her parents, Chenchu and Venkata Venna were also present at the party. At some point during the party, the mother of Saanvi, Chenchu, was reported to have spoken about the gold jewellery that Saanvi was wearing and her being babysitted by her grandparents. Yandamuri was also reported to have held Saanvi during the party. Prior to the crime, Yandamuri had lost $15,000 at a casino, which is possibly a motive behind the crime.\n\n\n== Crime ==\nOn 22 October 2012, Yandamuri returned to the Vennas’ apartment suite at Marquis, while wearing a black hoodie. Yandamuri proceeded to knock on the Vennas’ door, leading to 61-year-old Satyavathi Venna, Saanvi's grandmother, answering. Yandamuri then brandished a four-inch knife, in an attempt to abduct Saanvi. Satyavathi attempted to back away, into the kitchen where she would later die, as Yandamuri continued to brandish his knife and follow her. Yandamuri then picked up Saanvi, as he was still brandishing his knife towards Satyavathi. An altercation soon ensued, where Yandamuri allegedly fell down while holding Saanvi, causing him to slit Satyavathi's throat and fall down atop of Saanvi. This was later proven false, as Satyavathi's autopsy results show that she had died from three deep \"chopping wounds\" to her neck area, with some of them striking bone, as well as three stab wounds to her chest. She had also lost fingers in the altercation, as she had tried to guard her neck. After the altercation, Saanvi began to cry, due to Yandamuri falling atop of her. To muffle Saanvi's cries, Yandamuri placed a handkerchief in her mouth and later fastened a towel around the handkerchief to secure it. This later caused Saanvi to die from suffocation. Yandamuri then proceeded to rummage through suitcases, finding Saanvi's jewellery in a blue suitcase. After this, Yandamuri placed Saanvi inside of the suitcase, half-zipped, then left the suitcase inside the men's sauna of the apartment's gym. Yandamuri then went to his own apartment to take a shower, returning afterwards to discard the suitcase in a dumpster. Yandamuri also discarded some of the jewellery into the Schuylkill River and kept the remainder in a bag, concealed behind a vending machine inside of his office building. A ransom note for $50,000 was also left at the scene by Yandamuri, intended for Saanvi's parents. The note, with many spelling errors stated:\n\nshiva[,] [sic; Venkata Venna] your daughter has been kidnapped[.] if [sic] you report this to cops[,] your daughter will be cut into pieces and found dead[.] if [sic] you inform this to anyone[,] you will find your daughter body parts [sic] thrown into your apartments[.] our [sic] prople [sic] are monitoring all your moves all the time[,] your emails & phones are being traced[.]\nif [sic] you want your daughter alive and safe , [sic] follow our instructions carefully.\nwe [sic] want $50,000.00 by end of the day[.]\nyour [sic] wife[,] lata [Chenchu Venna] have [sic] to bring money to the location alone.\nif [sic] we see you or your wife accompanied with (or) informed to anyone (cop/human), you will find your daughter dead. This is very serious.\nIts [sic] up to you to decide, you want your fyr [sic] old daughter Smonths [sic] of your income.\nBy 8PM today, lata [Chenchu Venna] alone should get $50,000.00 cash and come to baha fresh at acme store complex.

Remember that your baby is starving since morning[.]\n\n\n== Investigation, interrogation and arrest ==\nThe investigation into Yandamuri started when detectives from the Upper Merion police were alerted to the murder of Satyavathi, the disappearance of Saanvi from an apartment suite, and the ransom note left behind by Yandamuri. As days elapsed without any hint of a perpetrator, suspicions curved towards Yandamuri, a neighbour of the Vennas, who had shown an odd interest in the Saanvi, days prior to her vanishing. The interrogation of Yandamuri was a pivotal moment in the investigation, as detectives revealed the truth behind the crime. After he was brought in for questioning, Yandamuri was originally defiant towards disclosing his actions, but as the evidence mounted against him, his attitude switched from defiance to desperation. Throughout hours of continuous interrogation, detectives were able to obtain proclamations from Yandamuri, exposing the details of the crime he had committed, leading to his arrest four days after the crime.\n\n\n== Trial ==\nYandamuri's trial began on 25 September 2014 and was highly publicized and controversial, due to the nature of his crime and his Indian citizenship. The jury selection took several weeks due to the high-profile nature of his case. The prosecution presented many pieces of physical evidence, connecting Yandamuri to the crime scene. It contained fingerprints, DNA samples and surveillance footage. Witnesses further testified that they saw Yandamuri near the victims’ apartment suite on the day of the crime. Yandamuri's defence crew provided a vigorous defence, arguing that their client had been coerced into confessing his role, by the detectives. They likewise produced questions about the dependability of the material evidence, suggesting that it may have been tampered with. During the whole of his trial, Yandamuri maintained innocence, claiming that he had been framed for the murders. Nevertheless, his account was weakened by the overwhelming amount of evidence bestowed by the prosecutor, abandoning little doubt in the minds of the jury about his guilt. At the end of his trial, Yandamuri was found guilty on all counts and officially sentenced to death on 20 November 2014, after he decided to give up on finding more arguments.\n\n\n== Incarceration ==\nAs of 2024, Yandamuri is incarcerated on death row at SCI Somerset. He was previously incarcerated at SCI Greene and SCI Phoenix, until he was finally moved to SCI Somerset, where he currently resides.\n\n\n=== Postponed execution ===\nOn 8 January 2018, Yandamuri's execution warrant was signed. He was scheduled to be executed by lethal injection on 23 February 2018, at age 32, but it was halted due to the 2015 moratorium of the death penalty in Pennsylvania.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCapital punishment in Pennsylvania\nCapital punishment in the United States\nList of death row inmates in the United States\nState Correctional Institution – Somerset\nMir Aimal Kansi (another South Asian who was previously on death row in the United States, before his 2002 execution)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Volga (Russian: Волга) is a Soviet and later Russian icebreaking patrol ship in service with the Coast Guard of the Border Service of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation. It is one of eight Project 97P patrol ships built by Admiralty Shipyard in Leningrad in 1973–1981.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nIn the mid-1950s, the Soviet Union began developing a new diesel-electric icebreaker design based on the 1942-built steam-powered icebreaker Eisbär to meet the needs of both civilian and naval operators. Built in various configurations until the early 1980s, the Project 97 icebreakers and their derivatives became the largest and longest-running class of icebreakers and icebreaking vessels built in the world.The patrol ship variant, Project 97P (Russian: 97П), was developed as a response to the renewed interest of the Soviet Navy and Soviet Border Troops on icebreaking patrol vessels after United States Coast Guard and Canadian Coast Guard icebreakers began appearing more frequently near the country's northern maritime borders. New icebreaking patrol vessels were needed because existing Soviet naval vessels could not operate in ice-covered waters and large icebreakers, in addition to being unarmed and operated by civilians, could not be distracted from their primary mission of escorting merchant ships.Project 97P patrol ships are 70 metres (230 ft) long overall and have a beam of 18.1 metres (59 ft). Fully laden, the vessels draw 6.5 metres (21.3 ft) of water and have a displacement of 3,710 tonnes (3,650 long tons). Their three 1,800-horsepower (1,300 kW) 10-cylinder 13D100 two-stroke opposed-piston diesel engines are coupled to generators that power electric propulsion motors driving two propellers in the stern. In addition to being slightly bigger than the icebreakers they are based on, Project 97P lacks the bow propeller and features a bigger deckhouse built of aluminum-magnesium alloy to reduce weight as well as a helideck capable of receiving Kamov Ka-25 or Ka-27 helicopters.All Project 97P patrol ships were initially armed with a twin 76 mm AK-726 deck gun and two 30 mm AK-630 close-in weapon systems, but the ships operated by the navy were later disarmed.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe seventh of eight Project 97P patrol ships was laid down at Admiralty Shipyard in Leningrad on 27 February 1979, launched on 19 April 1980, and delivered on 26 December 1980. The ship was named after the Volga River and, after sailing to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the Russian Far East via the Northern Sea Route, joined the maritime unit of the KGB Border Troops.In May 1990, Volga became the first Soviet vessel to visit the West Coast of the United States since the Second World War when it visited San Francisco during the bicentennial celebrations of the United States Coast Guard.In 2003, Volga participated in Russian-American naval exercises.Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Volga was passed over to the Coast Guard of the Border Service of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation. The vessel remains in service as of 2024.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Wandering Heart (Spanish: Errante corazón; released in Spain as Ámame) is a 2021 internationally co-produced drama film written and directed by Leonardo Brzezicki which stars Leonardo Sbaraglia alongside Miranda de la Serna and Eva Llorach. It is a co-production by companies from Argentina, Brazil, Spain, Chile, and the Netherlands.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter a breakup, embittered homosexual father Santiago takes his teenage daughter Laila—whom with he has toxic relationship—with him, spending a chaotic summertime across Argentina and Brazil.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nWandering Heart is an Argentine-Brazilian-Spanish-Chilean-Dutch international co-production by Ruda Cine, RT Features, Vértigo Films, Quijote Films and Keplerfilm. It was shot in between Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe film was released directly on HBO Max in Argentina on 9 October 2021. It received a theatrical release at Buenos Aires' Cine Gaumont on 14 October 2021. The film screened at the 26th Queer Lisboa International Queer Film Festival on 18 September 2022.  It was released theatrically in Spain on 1 April 2022 under the title Ámame by Vértigo.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAlfonso Rivera of Cineuropa considered that while the film's premise \"is not particularly original\" and \"some of the characters can end up seeming excessively distraught and querulous\", its lead actor manages to pull off a \"miracle\" by never ceasing to fascinate the audience with the portrayal of a \"romantic, lonesome animal in pain\".\nJavier Ocaña of El País wrote that the helmer moves his gaze (and the camera) around an \"immense actor in a state of grace\" [portraying] a character who could well be the same one as [Sbaraglia's] in Pain and Glory.\nReviewing for the International Cinephile Society,  Matthew Joseph Jenner rated the film 4 out of 5 stars, deeming it to be \"a compassionate and poignant immersion into the lives of these characters as they voyage through the world, unearthing its secrets and embracing its unconventional nature\".\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Argentine films of the 2020s\nList of Brazilian films of the 2020s\nList of Spanish films of 2022\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Louisa Elizabeth Rolls Vaughan (8 October 1810, London – 24 January 1853, Welsh Bicknor), commonly known as Eliza, was a Welsh Catholic convert and mother of influential Catholic figures in England and Australia. She is under consideration for beatification in the Catholic Church.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nEliza was born on 8 October 1810 in London to John Rolls, a member of the renowned Rolls family of The Hendre and Justice of the Peace for Monmouthshire; and Martha Barnet, only daughter and heiress of Jacob Barnet, a businessman. She was the youngest of five with two brothers, John E. W. and Alexander, and two sisters, Martha Sarah and Jessy. Her grandnephew, Charles Stewart Rolls, a motoring and aviation pioneer co-founded the Rolls-Royce car manufacturing firm.\nDescribed as a family of \"earnest evangelicals\", Eliza and her siblings were baptized in the Protestant tradition, the faith her family ancestry upheld. Despite her Protestant upbringing, she was deeply impressed by the exemplary service of the Catholic Church towards the poor and heard of many Catholic saints during her childhood education in France.\n\n\n=== Marriage and Conversion ===\nOn 12 July 1830, Eliza married John Francis Vaughan, eldest son of William Vaughan of Courtfield. She converted to Catholicism, despite the objection of her relatives, on 31 October 1830 as a result of the Vaughan's devotion to the Christian faith and John Francis being a member of the Sodality of Our Lady. She eventually received the Sacrament of Confirmation twelve years later from Bishop John Brown.

Throughout her life, she made it a habit of spending an hour a day in prayer, between 5 and 6 p.m., before the Blessed Sacrament inside their family chapel in Courtfield. There she prayed fervently that God may give her a large family and that many of her children would enter religious life. \n\nEliza taught her children to combine spiritual and religious duties with fun and joy in a way that was very natural to them. Because of her, devotions and daily Masses in the family chapel were just as much as part of her children's everyday life as playing, riding horses, amateur theater, and music. Her charitable works of visiting the sick and helping the needy encouraged as well her children to be generous and make sacrifices such as giving away their toys or savings. She often told them the lives of the saints. \n\nShe began her steadfast prayer for vocations after reading about St. Stephen Harding, one of the founders of the Cistercian Order, in The Lives of the Saints written by John Henry Newman, and found great inspiration, saying: \"Ever since I read the account of St. Bernard and his four brothers leaving the world and retiring to a monastery I have prayed that all my sons will follow their example.\" \nAt some point, Eliza started praying to the mothers of saints, asking their intercessions that some of her children would be called to serve God and the Church. Her prayers were eventually answered having six priests: two priests in religious orders, one diocesan priest, one bishop, one archbishop and one cardinal; and four nuns in religious orders in the family.\n\n\n=== Death ===\nEliza died on 24 January 1853, at the age of 42, shortly after giving birth to her 14th child. She was interred in the Courtfield House Chapelyard. \n\nIn a letter, John Francis expressed his belief that divine providence brought Eliza to him, saying: \"I thanked the Lord in adoration today that I could give back to him my dearly beloved wife. I poured out my heart to him, full of thankfulness that, as an example and a guide, he gave me Eliza with whom I am still now bound by an inseparable, spiritual bond. What wonderful consolation and grace she brought me! I still see her as I always saw her before the Blessed Sacrament: her inner purity and extraordinary human kindness which her beautiful face reflected during prayer.\"\n\n\n== Beatification ==\nSince 2023, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cardiff has initiated investigations into the possible sainthood for Louisa Elizabeth Rolls Vaughan. The Integrated Parish Communications describes her as \"a particularly encouraging example of a mother imbued with a priestly spirit who frequently prayed for vocations.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nElizabeth “Eliza” Rolls Vaughan at Find a Grave\nEliza Rolls-Vaughan at Santi, beati e testimoni - Enciclopedia dei Santi",

During his tenure, Hitachi held rapid growth and helped produce numerous records, building the world's first Shinkansen train to top 200 km/h, as well as the Kasumigaseki Building's elevators, which were the fastest in Japan at the time. He was considered one of the country's leading experts on nuclear energy.\nKomai was one of few Japanese members of the Club of Rome think tank, whose Limitation of Growth report inspired him to create the Hitachi Research Institute in 1973 after stepping down as president. This was during the wake of major restructuring in the company, following the Nixon shock and subsequent OAPEC oil crisis. After resigning, Komai was succeeded by Hirokichi Yoshiyama.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ali ibn Ibrahim ibn Najib al-Dawla was a scholar who was sent as envoy of the Fatimid Caliphate to Yemen, directly intervening in local affairs of the allied Sulayhid dynasty, from 1119 until his recall in disgrace in 1125.\n\n\n== Life ==\nAli ibn Ibrahim ibn Najib al-Dawla was the librarian of al-Afdal Shahanshah, the vizier and de facto ruler of the Fatimid Caliphate. His background is unknown, but he was evidently well educated, and it is likely that he was instructed in Isma'ili doctrine as well. \nIn 1119, al-Afdal resolved to more closely align Yemen, where the Sulayhid queen Arwa (r. 1067–1138) ruled the only major Isma'ili community outside Egypt itself that had remained loyal to Cairo after the Nizari–Musta'li schism in 1095. Ibn Najib al-Dawla was given lofty honorific titles proclaiming his high standing and proximity to the Fatimid imam–caliph, al-Amir (r. 1101–1130), an escort of twenty elite Hujariyya cavalry, and sent to Yemen by sea. The group made first for the island of Dahlak in the Red Sea, where Ibn Najib al-Dawla was instructed by an Isma'ili missionary from Aden about the land and its principal personages, including such details as distinguishing features, scars, or tattoos, which allowed Ibn Najib al-Dawla to later demonstrate his \"super-human\" insight. \nAfter landing at Aden, Ibn Najib al-Dawla went to Arwa's winter residence at Dhu Jibla. Supported by Arwa and the Banu Hamdan tribe, who provided 300 soldiers, in short time he had become the virtual ruler of the parts of Yemen recognizing Fatimid suzerainty. In 1121, after al-Afdal's assassination, his successor, al-Ma'mun al-Bata'ihi, sent 400 Armenian and 700 Black African archers to Yemen to bolster Ibn Najib al-Dawla's position, again by sea. Disposing of a regular military force loyal only to him, Ibn Najib al-Dawla made al-Janad his base and began to pursue his own policies, disregarding the various tribal chieftains, and even Queen Arwa, whom he is said to have dismissed as a senile old woman. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\nBrett, Michael (2017).

        "content": "Neva (Russian: Нева) is a Soviet and later Russian icebreaking patrol ship in service with the Coast Guard of the Border Service of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation. It is one of eight Project 97P patrol ships built by Admiralty Shipyard in Leningrad in 1973–1981.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nIn the mid-1950s, the Soviet Union began developing a new diesel-electric icebreaker design based on the 1942-built steam-powered icebreaker Eisbär to meet the needs of both civilian and naval operators. Built in various configurations until the early 1980s, the Project 97 icebreakers and their derivatives became the largest and longest-running class of icebreakers and icebreaking vessels built in the world.\nThe patrol ship variant, Project 97P (Russian: 97П), was developed as a response to the renewed interest of the Soviet Navy and Soviet Border Troops on icebreaking patrol vessels after United States Coast Guard and Canadian Coast Guard icebreakers began appearing more frequently near the country's northern maritime borders. New icebreaking patrol vessels were needed because existing Soviet naval vessels could not operate in ice-covered waters and large icebreakers, in addition to being unarmed and operated by civilians, could not be distracted from their primary mission of escorting merchant ships.\nProject 97P patrol ships are 70 metres (230 ft) long overall and have a beam of 18.1 metres (59 ft). Fully laden, the vessels draw 6.5 metres (21.3 ft) of water and have a displacement of 3,710 tonnes (3,650 long tons). Their three 1,800-horsepower (1,300 kW) 10-cylinder 13D100 two-stroke opposed-piston diesel engines are coupled to generators that power electric propulsion motors driving two propellers in the stern. In addition to being slightly bigger than the icebreakers they are based on, Project 97P lacks the bow propeller and features a bigger deckhouse built of aluminum-magnesium alloy to reduce weight as well as a helideck capable of receiving Kamov Ka-25 or Ka-27 helicopters.\nAll Project 97P patrol ships were initially armed with a twin 76 mm AK-726 deck gun and two 30 mm AK-630 close-in weapon systems, but the ships operated by the navy were later disarmed.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe sixth of eight Project 97P patrol ships was laid down at Admiralty Shipyard in Leningrad on 23 November 1977, launched on 28 July 1978, and delivered on 27 December 1978. The ship was named after the Neva River and joined the maritime unit of the KGB Border Troops.\nUnable to transit the Northern Sea Route in 1979, Neva was initially stationed in the western sector. In the following year, it sailed to the Russian Far East along the Arctic coast while escorting the Soviet Navy Delta III-class submarine K-223 Podolsk. For this reason, the vessel was fitted with a stern towing notch, a unique feature among the Project 97P patrol ships.\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Neva was passed over to the Coast Guard of the Border Service of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation. The vessel remains in service as of 2024.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "For the Geothermal Energy Act of 1980, please see Geothermal Act.\n\nThe Geothermal Energy Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1974 was enacted by the 93rd U.S. Congress on September 3, 1974 (H.R. 14920) to address the critical shortage of environmentally acceptable forms of energy. Congress found that some geothermal resources contain valuable byproducts such as potable water and mineral compounds which should be processed and recovered as national resources.\n\n\n== The Geothermal Energy Coordination and Management Project ==\nThe act established the Geothermal Energy Coordination and Management Project which shall be composed of six members as follows:\n\nOne to be appointed by the President.\nAn assistant director of the National Science Foundation (NSF)\nAn Assistant Secretary of the Department of the Interior\nAn Assistant Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\nThe General Manager of the Atomic Energy Commission\nAn Assistance Administrator of the Federal Energy Administration (the predecessor to the Department of Energy)\nThe project goal is for the effective management and coordination in terms of a national geothermal energy research, development, and demonstration program.\n\n\n== The Geothermal Loan Guarantee Program (GLGP) ==\nThe act gives the Chairman of the Project the authority to designate an appropriate Federal agency to guarantee loans for the commercial applications of geothermal energy. The head of the designated agency is authorized, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, to guarantee loans from lenders to qualified borrowers for the development of geothermal energy projects.\nAs of 1980, the program was managed by the Assistant Secretary for Resource Applications at the Department of Energy (DOE).\n\n\n=== Geothermal Resource Development Fund ===\nThe act also gives the Treasury of the United States the Geothermal Resource Development Fund for the head of the designated agency to provide loan guaranties as well as to provide the interest assistance program authorized by the act.\n\n\n=== Loan limits ===\nWith the GLGP, 100% of a loan could have a federal guarantee with a limit of the loan being 75% of project costs. This was subsequently amended in 1980 to allow for a federal guarantee of 90% of the total aggregate project cost providing that the applicant was an electric, housing or other cooperative or a municipality. The limitations, however, were:\n\nThe loans were limited to $100 million per project.\nNo qualified borrower was to receive more than $200 million in loans.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nAccording to paper presented at the World Geothermal Congress in 2005 of the International Geothermal Association, the program had two deficiencies:\n\nThe strict guidelines of the loan guaranty left those who could have likely received the loans without the guarantee as the most likely candidates for the program.\nUtilities avoided the program because default, even with the guarantee program, would have been a detriment to their credit ratings.\nSource:\n\n\n== Reporting requirements ==\nThe chairman of the project shall submit annual reports to the President and Congress, and to provide as an accurate a judgement as is possible as to the extent that the act met its objectives by June. 30, 1980.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Despo (Despina) Botsi (Greek: Δέσπω (Δέσποινα) Μπότση) was a Souliotissa who went down in history for her resistance to the troops of Ali Pasha and her heroic death - together with the women and children she had under her protection - in the tower of Dimoulas, in the village of Riniasa (now Riza) of Zaloggos, on December 25, 1803.\nDespo came from the Souliot family of Sachaioi. Her brothers were Giannakis, Giorgos and Dimitrios Sechos or Karametsis. She was the wife of the Soulioti chief Giorgakis Botsis.\nThe extended family of Giorgakis Botsis had settled in the almost coastal village of Riniasa as early as 1802, tributary to Ali Pasha, where they now lived from agriculture. But when Ali Pasha's pursuit of the Souliots broke out, immediately after the decision of the former to abandon Souli and hand it over to the Pasha of Ioannina in December 1803, a group of about 500 Turkalvan soldiers passed through Riniasa and attacked the towns there established families.\nDespo Botsi, head of the family after the death of her husband, in order to avoid the soldiers and save her family, closed herself in the castle of the area, the Castle of Reniassa (better known as the \"Tower of Dimoulas\", today it is also referred to as \"Castle of Despo\") along with all her daughters-in-law and grandchildren. From there, she fought bravely against the soldiers, refusing to surrender. When the guns stopped firing, she set fire to the tower and burned with her family.\n\n\n== Folk poetry ==\nThe heroism of Despo Botsi has been immortalized in the following well-known folk song:\nA heavy roar is heard, many rifles fall. A month in marriage is thrown, a month in harokopi?  Neither do they throw themselves into marriage,\nnor do they throw themselves into harokopi.  Despo makes war with brides and bridegrooms.  Arvanitia plastered it in Dimoulas the tower:  \"Yorgena, drop the chariots, Suli is not here.  Here you are a slave of the Pasha, a slave of the Arvanites\".  \"Even if Suli prostrated, even if Ciapha turned,  Despo masters Liapides didn't do it, she doesn't do it\".  Drum in hand grab, daughters and brides shout:  \"Slaves of Turks let us not live, children come with me\".  And the firecrackers lit up, and everyone was on fire.\nAchós varýs akoúetai, pollá toufékia péftoun.\nMína se gámo ríchnontai, mína se charokópi?\nOudé se gámo ríchnontai oudé se charokópi.\nH Déspo kánei pólemo me nýfes kai m' angónia.\nArvanitiá tin plákose stou Dimoulá ton pýrgo:\n\"Giórgaina, ríxe t’ ármata, den eínai edó to Soúli.\nEdó eísai skláva tou pasá, skláva ton Arvaníton\".\n\"To Soúli ki an proskýnise, ki an toúrkepsen i Kiáfa,\ni Déspo aféntes Liápides den ékame, den kánei\".\nDavlí sto chéri árpaxe, kóres kai nýfes krázei:\n\"Skláves Toúrkon mi zísome, paidiá mazí mou eláte\".\nKai ta fysékia anápsane, ki óloi fotiá geníkan.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Japanese invasion of Cotabato is one of the three landings made by Japanese Army during their\n\nsieged of Mindanao. The landings in west coast of Mindanao took place in Zamboanga City in Zamboanga Province, Malabang in Lanao Province, and in towns Cotabato and Parang of Cotabato Province. Kawaguchi Detachment objective was to move towards Kabacan and link up with Muira Detachment who was driving west from Digos, Davao to control Sayre Highway from the southern terminus of it, which under the area of responsibility of 101st Infantry Division assigned in Cotabato-Davao Sector.\nJapanese was able to reached their objective on May 3, 1942, which created confusion among the troops of the Filipino and Americans defending the area due to sudden infiltration of the Japanese in Pikit town just few miles from Kabacan. The landing further inland in Pikit gave more complications on the Cotabato subsector forces forcing the Digos subsector to retreat to Kabacan.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn December 1941, General Vachon sent forces to Davao and Cotabato respectively to thwart any Japanese landings on these two fronts who aiming to reach Kabacan and control Sayre Highway. Vachon sent Lieutenant Colonel Russell J. Nelson to establish Cotabato Subsector force, he brought along 2nd Battalion, 102nd Infantry under Major William Baldwin to reinforce 2nd Regular Regiment of the Philippine Army under Lieutenant Colonel Calixto Duque who is based in Camp Luna in Parang overlooking the Polloc Harbor and the 3rd PC Infantry Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel Francisco Donesa.\nWhile Japanese landed in Davao on December 20, 1941, Cotabato subsector was not hit until April 1942. Nelson tried strengthened his sector but 3rd PC Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel  Francisco Donesa was pulled out and sent to Digos subsector to reinforced the forces there. In March, 2nd Battalion 104th Infantry under Captain John Natola was sent to reinforced Cotabato.\n\n\n== Combat narratives ==\nOn April 29, 1942 Kawaguchi Detachment arrived in the coast of Illana Bay. The made landings at dawn at Cotabato and Parang towns in Cotabato province on April 29, 1942, supported by naval and aircraft from Zamboanga.\n\n\n=== Parang ===\nColonel Duque's 2nd Infantry Regiment with over 600 men composed of newly recruited school boys delayed the Japanese for 4 hours at their beachhead with their stubborn resistance. Duque position his mean above the hill overlooking Polloc Harbor. However, Duque was forced to withdraw after Cotabato was easily sieged and the control of the highway was taken by the Japanese. To avoid being cutoff he retreated towards Malabang. 2nd Infantry Regiment now assigned to 81st Infantry Division under Brigadier General Guy O. Fort. Later Colonel Duque became 81st Division selected as its chief of staff.\n\n\n=== Cotabato ===\nColonel Nelson deployed the 2nd Battalion, 102nd Infantry under Major William Baldwin at the outskirt of the town support by 1st Battalion, 104th Infantry along the Pikit-Cotabato road. Soon, Japanese was able to sieged the town and in command of the highway Cotabato-Lanao Road. Nelson's troops gave a brave stand but a Japanese force was sent through the Mindanao River to make a land in Pikit with the help of Pro-Japanese Moros under Datu Sinsuat who served as guides. This worried Nelson more as he feared of being cutoff.\nGeneral Vachon sent 1st Battalion, 103rd Infantry to thwart this landing in Pikit. The landing in Pikit brought the Cotabato-Davao Sector into its knees as Digos Force was forced to retreat to Kabacan to avoid being cutoff if Japanese reach Kabacan. Fighting was instense and it reached Midsayap and General Vachon ordered Colonel Graves to retreat to Kabacan with his units who gave a stubborn resistance of Muira Detachment trying to reach Kabacan.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n101st Division was still firmly in control of Kabacan with his troops still fighting in Midsayap and Mlang but the Cagayan Sector was fast crumbling and could no longer put a line of resistance. General Sharp ordered all units in Mindanao to surrender on May 12, 1942, but only few surrender a vast number of 101st Division soldiers went to the hills and later joined guerilla movement among them the young and energetic young Moro officer Captain Salipada Pendatun who later became a senator.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== See also ===\nMindanao Force\n101st Infantry Division\n102nd Infantry Regiment\n101st Infantry Regiment\nKawaguchi Detachment\n\n\n=== External links ===\nThere were others, Unpublished papers of Colonel Hiram Tarkington, CO 61st Field Artillery Regiment, Philippine Army",

        "content": "Ruslan (Russian: Руслан) is a Soviet and later Russian Navy icebreaking patrol ship. It is one of eight Project 97P patrol ships built by Admiralty Shipyard in Leningrad in 1973–1981.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nIn the mid-1950s, the Soviet Union began developing a new diesel-electric icebreaker design based on the 1942-built steam-powered icebreaker Eisbär to meet the needs of both civilian and naval operators. Built in various configurations until the early 1980s, the Project 97 icebreakers and their derivatives became the largest and longest-running class of icebreakers and icebreaking vessels built in the world.\nThe patrol ship variant, Project 97P (Russian: 97П), was developed as a response to the renewed interest of the Soviet Navy and Soviet Border Troops on icebreaking patrol vessels after United States Coast Guard and Canadian Coast Guard icebreakers began appearing more frequently near the country's northern maritime borders. New icebreaking patrol vessels were needed because existing Soviet naval vessels could not operate in ice-covered waters and large icebreakers, in addition to being unarmed and operated by civilians, could not be distracted from their primary mission of escorting merchant ships.\nProject 97P patrol ships are 70 metres (230 ft) long overall and have a beam of 18.1 metres (59 ft). Fully laden, the vessels draw 6.5 metres (21.3 ft) of water and have a displacement of 3,710 tonnes (3,650 long tons). Their three 1,800-horsepower (1,300 kW) 10-cylinder 13D100 two-stroke opposed-piston diesel engines are coupled to generators that power electric propulsion motors driving two propellers in the stern. In addition to being slightly bigger than the icebreakers they are based on, Project 97P lacks the bow propeller and features a bigger deckhouse built of aluminum-magnesium alloy to reduce weight as well as a helideck capable of receiving Kamov Ka-25 or Ka-27 helicopters.\nProject 97P patrol ships were initially armed with a twin 76 mm AK-726 deck gun and two 30 mm AK-630 close-in weapon systems, but the ships operated by the navy were later disarmed.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe third of eight Project 97P patrol ships was laid down at Admiralty Shipyard in Leningrad on 26 December 1973, launched on 28 May 1974, and delivered on 26 September 1975. The ship was named after one of the main characters in Alexander Pushkin's poem Ruslan and Ludmila and joined the Soviet Navy Red Banner Northern Fleet.\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Ruslan was passed over to the Russian Navy. The vessel remains in service as of 2024.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "revision_id": 1219119930,
        "earliest_creation_date": "2015-07-23 01:48:36",
        "content": "Among the main controversies involving Jair Bolsonaro are his right-wing populist position, his criticism of the political left, his classification of torture as a legitimate practice, his opposition to LGBT rights and several other questionable statements, which have led to 30 calls for his impeachment and three court convictions. Several international organizations consider that his authoritarian tendencies threaten to cause irreparable harm to civil society, the press, Afro-Brazilians, indigenous people and critics of the government. Bolsonaro also has a hostile relationship with the press and has been accused of proliferating fake news.\nAlthough his statements are classified on the far-right of the political perspective, Bolsonaro rejects such categorization. On March 12, 1999, he spoke in the Chamber of Deputies to praise Federal Deputy Luiza Erundina, a member of the Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB) and recognized as a left-wing figure. After the 2002 elections, he announced his vote for Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) in the second round, although he had supported Ciro Gomes (then affiliated to the PPS) in the first round.\nHis statements have been described as hate speech, homophobic, misogynistic, sexist, racist and anti-refugee. In August 2018, the British magazine The Economist described him as a \"radical\", a \"religious nationalist\", a \"right-wing demagogue\", an \"apologist for dictators\" and a \"threat to democracy\".\nBolsonaro often defends Brazil's military dictatorship. During an argument with demonstrators in December 2008, he declared that \"the mistake of the dictatorship was to torture and not to kill.\" He has been criticized by the media, politicians and the Torture Never Again group, especially after he posted a poster on his office door telling relatives of those who disappeared during the military dictatorship that \"those who look for bones are dogs\". During the COVID-19 pandemic, Bolsonaro spread disinformation and made statements contrary to the recommendations of health agencies, besides carrying out several public activities.\n\n\n== Operation Dead End ==\nOn October 27, 1987, Jair Bolsonaro reported on the Operation Dead End to reporter Cássia Maria from Veja magazine. He supported an improvement in pay and opposed the arrest of Captain Saldon Pereira Filho. The aim of the operation was to explode low-powered bombs in toilets at the Agulhas Negras Military Academy, in Resende, and in military barracks in order to protest against the low salaries that military personnel were receiving.\nBolsonaro allegedly drew a sketch of where the bomb would be installed in the Guandu Pipeline, which supplies water to the municipality of Rio de Janeiro. Veja handed the material over to the Minister of the Army, Leônidas Pires Gonçalves, who, after four months of investigation, concluded that the report was correct and that the captains had lied. Unanimously, on April 19, 1988, the Military Justification Council (CJM) ruled that Bolsonaro was guilty and that \"his incompatibility for the rank of officer and consequent loss of rank be declared\". In his defense, Bolsonaro said that Veja magazine had published fraudulent accusations in order to sell more with sensationalist articles.\nThe case was submitted to the Superior Military Court (STM). The trial was held in June 1988 and the court accepted the thesis of Bolsonaro's and Captain Fábio Passos da Silva's defense, which claimed that the documentary evidence was insufficient because it did not allow for handwriting comparisons, since block letters had been used. They used the strategy of presenting four reports instead of the two required by the system, leading the justices to make a technical mistake in their verdicts. The STM acquitted the two officers, who were kept in the army. In the same year, Bolsonaro went into the military reserve with the rank of captain and began his political career, running for councillor in Rio de Janeiro. Later, the Army Police report was disproved by the Federal Police, which confirmed Bolsonaro's handwriting.\n\n\n== Corruption ==\nIn December 2020, Jair Bolsonaro was named \"Person of the Year\" by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), an international consortium of investigative journalists. According to the organization, Bolsonaro has \"surrounded himself with corrupt figures, used propaganda to promote his populist agenda, undermined the justice system, and waged a destructive war against the Amazon region that has enriched some of the country’s worst land owners.\"\n\n\n=== Assets ===\n\nBetween 2010 and 2014, Jair Bolsonaro's assets grew by more than 150% according to the declaration filed with the Superior Electoral Court (TSE). During this period, he acquired five properties worth a combined R$8 million, including two houses in Rio de Janeiro bought for R$500,000 and R$400,000, respectively, figures considerably lower than those evaluated at the time. The Federal Council of Real Estate Brokers (Cofeci) claims to have evidence that the purchase operation involved money laundering. According to the Electoral Justice, he owns cars worth up to R$105,000, a jet-ski and financial investments worth R$1.7 million. When he entered politics in 1989, Bolsonaro declared that he had a Fiat Panorama and two plots of land in Resende, valued at R$10,000. Until 2008, he and his children declared assets of about R$1 million, reaching R$15 million in 2017. As a congressman, he earned a salary of R$25,000, plus a Brazilian Army salary of R$5,700. In his defense, Bolsonaro claimed that Rodrigo Janot, former Prosecutor General of the Republic, had filed an anonymous complaint about his declaration of assets in 2014 and that the accusations were \"slanderous\" and part of a \"campaign to assassinate his reputation\".\nBolsonaro has also received a housing allowance of about R$3,000 from the Chamber of Deputies since 1995, despite owning a two-bedroom apartment in Brasilia since 1998. A report on the Vice website raised the issue in March 2017 due to the repercussions of Operation Weak Meat. Bolsonaro posted a video on his YouTube channel explaining that the R$200,000, half of the amount spent on his campaign, was returned as a \"donation to the party\". However, the TSE spreadsheet revealed that the amount was transferred back to Bolsonaro's account, but now as a donation from the party fund.\nIn April 2017, Bolsonaro was indicted for using his parliamentary quota to pay for trips around Brazil to present himself as a pre-candidate for the presidency in 2018. According to the Chamber's rules on the use of the quota, no expenses of an electoral nature will be allowed. Between 2016 and 2017, at least six of his trips were funded by the Chamber for a total of R$22,000. His press office denied that he was campaigning and claimed that the use of the travel quota was related to his participation in the Chamber's Public Security Committee, on which he is an alternate.\nOn April 7, 2020, the Agência Sportlight revealed invoices showing that Bolsonaro, when he was a member of parliament, overbilled for the reimbursement of public fuel funds. At the end of the month, Minister Luiz Fux of the Supreme Federal Court (STF) sent a criminal complaint to the Public Prosecutor's Office (PGR) against Jair Bolsonaro. Criminal lawyer Sidney Duran Gonzalez filed the complaint.\n\n\n=== Nepotism ===\nIn December 2017, the newspaper O Globo reported that Bolsonaro and his children employed one of his ex-wives and two of her relatives in public positions in their offices. According to the newspaper, they occupied the positions from 1998 onwards. However, as the hirings took place before 2008, when the Supreme Federal Court (STF) standardized the rules against nepotism, they cannot legally be classified in this way.\nA report in Folha de S. Paulo in January 2018 revealed that Bolsonaro had hired a ghost servant in Brasilia. According to the article, between January and June, Walderice Santos da Conceição received more than R$17,000 as an employee of his office in the Chamber of Deputies, but worked as an açaí vendor in the municipality of Angra dos Reis, in Rio de Janeiro. She had been one of his 14 employees since 2003, earning a salary of R$1,416.33. In August 2018, Bolsonaro announced that Walderice had resigned from her job as an advisor and commented: \"She has two dogs there and in order not to die she occasionally gives the dogs water, that's all. That's her crime, giving water to the dogs\".\n\n\n=== Ana Cristina Valle ===\nIn September 2018, Veja magazine published an article detailing a 500-page lawsuit filed by ex-wife Ana Cristina Siqueira Valle against Bolsonaro. In the document, filed in April 2008 with the 1st Family Court of Rio de Janeiro in the midst of a contentious separation, Ana Cristina made several accusations against Bolsonaro, including: hiding assets from the Electoral Justice in the 2006 election, incompatibility of income with his monthly earnings and theft of cash and jewelry from a safe at a Banco do Brasil branch. Following the allegations, the Federal Revenue Service opened an investigation in 2008, but found no irregularities. After the publication of the report, Bolsonaro sent a request to the Public Prosecutor's Office of Rio de Janeiro asking that issue 2602 of Veja magazine be withdrawn from circulation. It also asked for an investigation into how the article accessed a case that had been archived and was kept secret from the courts. Ana Cristina later claimed to have lied to the courts in her testimony.\n\n\n=== Slush fund ===\nOn October 19, 2018, the Superior Electoral Court (TSE), following a request from the Workers' Party (PT), launched an investigation based on a report in the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper, which claimed that companies paid up to R$12 million in contracts for the mass sending of fake news against Luís Inácio Lula da Silva on the WhatsApp app to favor Bolsonaro's presidential campaign. Bolsonaro's defense says he has been falsely accused and would take the appropriate legal measures. According to the PT, the act consisted of the practice of slush fund.\nIn a 1999 interview with a program on Rede Bandeirantes, Bolsonaro said: \"My advice and I do it: I withhold everything possible.\" His name is registered on the Furnas List, a corruption scheme that used illegal money to finance 156 political campaigns in 2000. Although he claims that the list is a fake, its authenticity has been proven by a Federal Police report. In the Consultation of Candidate Campaign Donors and Suppliers, on the website of the Superior Electoral Court (TSE), Bolsonaro's name also appears as a recipient of R$200,000 from the company JBS during his campaign in 2014. That year, Bolsonaro was re-elected federal deputy with the highest number of votes in Rio de Janeiro and received more than 460,000 votes.\nIn 2016, Bolsonaro opposed an amendment articulated mainly by parties and parliamentarians involved in Operation Car Wash to give amnesty to crimes of slush fund. On October 7, 2020, he announced the end of operation, claiming that there is no corruption in his government. Carlos Fernando dos Santos Lima, a former member of the operation, stated on social media that Bolsonaro is one of those responsible for ending the operation by making a political alliance with \"Renans, Maias, Aras, Toffolis and Gilmares, and all of them, hand in hand around the great national accord, decided to save the rotten and nefarious system of political corruption. Bolsonaro is a shameful fraud\".\n\n\n=== Queiroz case ===\nIn 2019, the Public Prosecutor's Office of Rio de Janeiro opened an investigation into the possible money laundering and concealment of assets of former parliamentary advisor Fabrício Queiroz and Senator Flávio Bolsonaro. According to the bank responsible for the account, the financial transactions were incompatible with Queiroz's assets, economic activity or professional occupation and financial capacity. During the period, at least eight employees of Flávio Bolsonaro's office made deposits totaling R$150,000 into Queiroz's account on dates after their salaries had been paid. The operations raised suspicions that Bolsonaro was misappropriating part of the salaries of civil servants in the illegal practice known as \"rachadinha\". One of Queiroz's transactions mentioned in the report is a check for R$24,000 issued in favor of First Lady Michelle Bolsonaro, which Jair Bolsonaro justified as payment for a R$40,000 loan.\nOn August 23, 2020, when questioned by a reporter from Grupo Globo about the deposits made by Fabrício Queiroz in the total amount of R$89,000 in Michelle Bolsonaro's account, Bolsonaro threatened the reporter by replying: \"I'd like to smash your face in\". The episode had a negative repercussion, including internationally, generating criticism from various organizations such as the Brazilian Press Association (ABI), the Brazilian Association of Investigative Journalism (ABRAJI) and the Order of Attorneys of Brazil (OAB). Jair Bolsonaro and his son Carlos Bolsonaro posted a different version of the story on their social networks, with a caption distorting the situation, but they were quickly refuted by news-checking portals.\n\n\n=== Saudi jewels case ===\nOn March 3, 2023, a report in the newspaper O Estado de São Paulo and confirmed by CNN Brazil revealed that in October 2021, during Jair Bolsonaro's presidency, members of his government's top and middle ranks allegedly tried to bring into Brazil, in violation of the law, a set of jewelry valued at R$16.5 million, consisting of a necklace, ring, watch and pair of diamond earrings, which were supposedly a gift from the Saudi Arabian monarchy to First Lady Michelle Bolsonaro. After the Federal Revenue Service seized the jewels because of their alleged illegality, customs officials allegedly faced pressure from members of the Bolsonaro government to release the items. There were at least four attempts to remove the items from customs, with the last allegedly taking place on December 29, 2022, two days before the end of the presidential term. The report said that the Federal Police opened a police inquiry on March 6, 2023, to investigate the fact reported and the alleged involvement of former President Jair Bolsonaro in the episode.\nOn March 9, 2023, Minister Augusto Nardes of the Federal Court of Accounts (TCU) ordered Bolsonaro to preserve intact and not wear the collection of men's jewelry he allegedly received from Saudi Arabia, as the first set of gifts had been detained by the Federal Revenue Service at Guarulhos airport in October 2021. On the same day, Senator Omar Aziz, chairman of the Federal Senate's Transparency and Oversight Committee, announced that he would investigate the existence of a relationship between the sale of the Landulpho Alves Refinery in Mataripe (located in Bahia and previously owned until 2021 by Petrobras) and the jewels received as a gift from Saudi Arabia by the Bolsonaro government. Bolsonaro reportedly rejected these accusations through his social networks. On March 15, 2023, the TCU ordered Bolsonaro to return the case of men's jewelry received from Saudi Arabia and weapons donated by the United Arab Emirates to the coffers of the Presidency of the Republic within five days.\nOn March 24, 2023, former President Bolsonaro's lawyers handed over the second set of jewels he received, estimated at R$400,000. After verifying that Bolsonaro still possessed jewels, the TCU ordered him to return the third box of jewelry with assets estimated at more than R$500,000. He handed over on April 4, 2023, the day before he gave evidence to the Federal Police.\n\n\n== Human rights ==\n\n\n=== Arms, physical violence, death penalty and torture ===\n\nIn 1999, Bolsonaro told the program Câmera Aberta that he was \"favorable to torture\" and called democracy \"crap\". In 2000, in an interview with IstoÉ magazine, he defended the use of torture in cases of drug trafficking and kidnapping, as well as summary execution for cases of premeditated crime. He explained that \"the aim is to get the guy to talk\" and \"get beaten up so he can talk\". In the interview, he also advocates censorship, although he doesn't specify what kind. Despite these statements, he recently said that he would never have been in favor of torture.\nOn April 17, 2016, during Dilma Rousseff's impeachment process, Jair Bolsonaro congratulated Federal Deputy Eduardo Cunha on his handling of the impeachment trial and paid homage to Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra, the first military officer to be recognized by the courts as one of the torturers of the military dictatorship. In his defense, Bolsonaro claimed that his statements during the impeachment vote were protected by parliamentary immunity. In a 2018 interview, he defended Ustra again and called him a \"national hero\".\nIn 1999, while explaining to presenter Jô Soares why he defended the firing squad of former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso (PSDB), he said that \"barbarity is privatizing Vale and telecommunications, handing over our oil reserves to foreign capital\". In several interviews, he favored the death penalty in Brazil for premeditated crimes. He also supports reducing the age of criminal responsibility to 16.\n\nIn 2015, in a video posted by Eduardo Bolsonaro (PSC-SP), Jair Bolsonaro said that \"violence is fought with violence and not with human rights banners\", such as those defended by Amnesty International, which he claimed was formed by \"scoundrels\" and \"idiots\". When asked about a survey by the organization that showed that the Brazilian police are the world's leading killers, Bolsonaro replied that he thought the \"Military Police of Brazil should kill more.\" Data from the 9th edition of the Public Security Yearbook, published by the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper, shows that an average of eight people are killed every day by Brazilian police officers.\nWhen asked during his presidential campaign in 2018 whether combating prejudice could be a government policy, Bolsonaro declared that he would put an end to what he called \"coitadismo\" (\"underdog syndrome\") in Brazil. He advocates repealing the Disarmament Statute and giving rural landowners the right to buy rifles to prevent invasions by the Landless Workers' Movement (MST). He also presented a bill that establishes voluntary chemical castration as a condition for a person convicted of rape to be able to advance their sentence. He is against the legalization of drugs. In the book A República das Milícias: Dos Esquadrões da Morte à Era Bolsonaro, Bruno Paes Manso argued for the existence of a \"Militia Republic\" in Brazil and classified Jair Bolsonaro as its captain.\n\n\n=== Brazilian military dictatorship ===\n\nBolsonaro is known for claiming that the Brazilian military dictatorship was a glorious period in Brazilian history. According to a letter published in the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper, it was \"20 years of order and progress\". In an interview with Época magazine in July 2011, he said that the military regime was not a dictatorship. Bolsonaro has been criticized by the media, politicians and the Torture Never Again group. In 1993, eight years after the return of democracy in Brazil, he said that only a military regime would lead to a more \"prosperous and sustainable country\". In an interview he gave to the TV show Custe o Que Custar (CQC) on March 28, 2011, he said that he was inspired by the military dictatorship and that he missed the government of presidents Médici, Geisel and Figueiredo. He also expressed his support for the possible development of an atomic bomb in Brazil.\nDuring the National Truth Commission's visit on September 21, 2013, to the 1st Army Police Battalion in Rio de Janeiro, where the DOI-CODI operated during the dictatorship, Bolsonaro pushed Senator Randolfe Rodrigues, who was trying to prevent him from entering the barracks. Rodrigues claimed that Bolsonaro punched him in the stomach, which he denied. At the scene, representatives of social movements such as Torture Never Again demanded that Bolsonaro leave, but he managed to enter the building. The delegation refused to conduct the visit in Bolsonaro's presence. In addition to Randolfe Rodrigues, Senator João Capiberibe (PSB-AP), who was tortured in the battalion during the dictatorship, and federal deputies Jandira Feghali (PCdoB-RJ) and Luiza Erundina (PSB-SP) were also present. Jair Bolsonaro supported the call for demonstrations on March 15, 2020, to close the National Congress and the Supreme Court. Several politicians and a Supreme Court justice claim that he has committed a crime of responsibility and misconduct.\n\n\n==== Miriam Leitão ====\nOn July 19, 2019, Bolsonaro claimed that journalist and writer Miriam Leitão \"was arrested when she was going to the Araguaia Guerrilla War to try to impose a dictatorship in Brazil\" and stated twice that Miriam \"lied about having been tortured\" and abused in military facilities during the military dictatorship. In a statement read out on Jornal Nacional, Rede Globo repudiated Bolsonaro's claims about her.\n\n\n==== Fernando Santa Cruz ====\n\nDuring a statement made a few days after his comment about Miriam Leitão, in which he criticized the role of the Order of Attorneys of Brazil (OAB) in the investigation into the knife attack he suffered during the 2018 election campaign, Bolsonaro announced that he would tell Felipe Santa Cruz, former president of the OAB, how his father Fernando Santa Cruz, rebel against the military regime, had died. The statement caused a lot of negative repercussions. Bolsonaro said that Fernando was killed by a left-wing group during the military dictatorship, which is contested by official documents that point out that he was a victim of the Brazilian state. On August 1, STF Minister Luís Roberto Barroso gave Bolsonaro 15 days to clarify the statement if he wanted to.\n\n\n==== Dilma Rousseff ====\nOn August 5, 2019, Justice Rosa Weber also gave Bolsonaro a 15-day deadline to clarify a statement in which he suggested that former president Dilma Rousseff had participated in armed actions during the military dictatorship that resulted in the death of US Army Captain Charles Chandler. On receiving the \"Personality of the Year\" award from the Brazil-United States Chamber of Commerce in Texas, Bolsonaro said that \"those who until recently occupied the government had their hands stained with blood in the armed struggle, even killing a captain, as I am a captain, in those sad years we had in the past\". American Captain Chandler was killed on October 12, 1968, in the Sumaré neighborhood, on the west side of the city of São Paulo, in an attack carried out by three militants from the Popular Revolutionary Vanguard (VPR) and the National Liberation Action (ALN). Dilma never belonged to any of these groups.\n\n\n=== Chilean dictatorship ===\nIn an interview with Veja magazine on December 2, 1998, Bolsonaro declared that the Chilean dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, which killed more than 3,000 people and exiled another 200,000, \"should have killed more people\". He also praised Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori as a \"model\" for his use of military intervention against the judiciary and the legislature.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nIn a speech in Campina Grande in February 2017, Bolsonaro criticized the secular state. In October 2018, he eased the statement by saying: \"We're going to run a government for everyone, regardless of religion. Even those who are atheists. We have almost 5% of atheists in Brazil, and you have the same needs as the rest of us\".\n\n\n=== Women, gender equality and abortion ===\nDuring an interview with IstoÉ magazine, Bolsonaro claimed to control the woman's topless habits. Regarding his first marriage, Bolsonaro said that his ex-wife was forced to \"follow his ideas\" in politics. In an interview with the newspaper Zero Hora in February 2015, he declared that it was unfair for women and men to receive the same salary because women get pregnant. In April 2017, in a speech at the Hebraica Club in Rio de Janeiro, Bolsonaro mentioned his 6-year-old daughter Laura, saying: \"I have five children. There were four men, then on the fifth I weakened and a woman came\".\nOn March 8, 2018, on International Women's Day, when questioned about whether he would increase female participation in a possible government, Bolsonaro replied: \"I respect women, but does anyone here want Dilma (Rousseff) back by any chance? [...] It's not a question of gender. You have to put in people who can do the job. If I appoint women, how many people of African descent will I have to appoint?\"\nIn an interview for Época magazine in 2000, he said that he considered aborting his son Jair Renan and passed the decision on to his wife. According to Gilson Cardoso, national coordinator of the National Human Rights Movement (MNDH), Bolsonaro opposes the Maria da Penha Law, which seeks to curb domestic violence against women.\n\n\n==== Maria do Rosário ====\n\nBolsonaro is perceived as sexist, misogynist and sexist by different sectors of society. On November 11, 2003, Bolsonaro and Federal Deputy Maria do Rosário were interviewed in the Green Room of Congress about the murders of Liana Friedenbach and Felipe Caffé. While Bolsonaro criticized the law on the age of criminal responsibility in Brazil, Rosário declared her position on the case according to the legislation. At one point, they got into an argument and Bolsonaro told Maria do Rosário: \"I would never rape you because you don't deserve it\".\nOn December 9, 2014, during a speech by Maria do Rosário in the Chamber of Deputies in which she defended the members of the Truth Commission, Bolsonaro verbally attacked her again. The fight occurred after she said that the military dictatorship was \"an absolute disgrace\" for Brazil. When questioned about his statements in a February 2015 interview, Bolsonaro told the newspaper Zero Hora: \"She doesn't deserve [to be raped] because she's very bad, because she's very ugly. She's not my type. I would never rape her.\"\n\nAs a result of statements made during discussions with Maria do Rosário, Bolsonaro was convicted in the first instance of moral damages in September 2015. In June 2016, the Supreme Federal Court (STF), examining a complaint from the Public Prosecutor's Office and Maria do Rosário, decided to open two criminal proceedings against him. In a decision by four votes to one, the Second Chamber of the Supreme Court ruled that, besides inciting rape, Bolsonaro had offended her reputation. He became a defendant for allegedly condoning crime and for libel. The complaint against Bolsonaro for condoning crime was filed in December 2014 by Ela Wiecko. On August 15, 2017, the Superior Court of Justice (STJ) maintained the decision and ordered the payment of compensation of R$10,000 to Maria do Rosário. On February 19, 2019, the STF denied an appeal by Bolsonaro's defense and upheld the decision. In May, the Court ordered that the amount be paid within 15 working days and that Bolsonaro publish a retraction note.\nOn June 13, 2019, Bolsonaro apologized to Maria do Rosário in a message published on social media. In apologizing for his statements, Bolsonaro said he wanted to take advantage of the case to express his \"full and unrestricted respect for women\" and stressed that he had defended harsher sentences for those convicted of rape, such as chemical castration, and classifying crimes of passion as heinous.\n\n\n==== Brigitte Macron ====\nAt the end of August 2019, a follower of Bolsonaro's Facebook page posted a montage of two photos, one of Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte, and the other of Bolsonaro and Michelle, to mock Brigitte's appearance. Bolsonaro's official page replied by laughing at the post. Members of the Bolsonaro government, such as Renzo Gracie and Paulo Guedes, also criticized Brigitte's appearance. The statements caused negative repercussions and spurred the #DesculpaBrigitte (#SorryBrigitte) online campaign, for which she publicly paid gratitude. The incident was the biggest diplomatic crisis between the two countries since the Lobster War in the 1960s. In an interview during the G7 meeting, Macron said that Bolsonaro's comment about his wife was \"extremely disrespectful\", as well as \"sad\" and a \"shame\" for Brazilian women. He said that he \"respects\" Brazilians, but that he hopes that \"they will very quickly have a president who behaves up to the job\".\n\n\n==== Patrícia Campos Mello ====\n\nOn February 18, 2020, during an interview with a group of supporters in front of the Alvorada Palace, Bolsonaro insulted journalist Patrícia Campos Mello with a sexual slur. Several parties, politicians, celebrities and journalistic organizations considered the speech an attack on democracy and repudiated his attitude. For the National Association of Newspapers (ANJ), the Brazilian Association of Investigative Journalism (Abraji) and the Observatory of Press Freedom of the Order of Attorneys of Brazil (OAB), Bolsonaro's speech disrespects the press and its essential work in democracy. The Brazilian Press Association (ABI) called the aggression \"cowardly\" and asked the Public Prosecutor's Office to denounce Bolsonaro's violation of conduct. The Union of Professional Journalists of São Paulo says that his speech can be classified as insulting and is subject to criminal liability. The National Federation of Journalists (Fenaj), in a note signed by the National Women's Commission, says that the episode involved sexism and misogyny. In a statement, Folha de S. Paulo said: \"Bolsonaro has assaulted reporter Patrícia Campos Mello and all professional journalism with his attitude. He also violates the dignity, honor and decorum that the law demands of the exercise of the Presidency.\"\n\n\n=== Homophobia ===\n\nBolsonaro has publicly condemned homosexuality and opposed the implementation of laws that guarantee LGBT rights, such as same-sex marriage, the adoption of children by homosexual couples and changes to civil registration for transsexuals. He said in an interview with Jornal de Notícias that \"many of the children who will be adopted by gay couples will be abused by these homosexual couples.\" In May 2002, he said to Folha de S. Paulo that he could beat up homosexuals: \"I'm not going to fight or discriminate, but if I see two men kissing in the street, I'm going to hit them.\"\nIn 2002, a human rights bill was sent to Congress that sought to amend the Military Penal Code to abolish the differentiation in punishment between homosexual and heterosexual libidinous practices. Bolsonaro opposed it, claiming that it would reduce the security of the military and force them to become homosexuals. In 2010, he threatened to be expelled from the Human Rights Commission of the Chamber of Deputies for defending, first in a debate on TV Câmara and later on other programs, that beating a child is the best way to prevent them from becoming gay. According to Federal Deputy Iriny Lopes, president of the commission, measures would be implemented before the end of the legislative year, since Bolsonaro's remarks were a direct attack on human rights. Pedro Wilson, a member of the commission, supported Lopes' decision and added that it was not the first time he had acted in such a way. In response to the decision, Bolsonaro said he didn't care about them and asked for respect for the, according to him, heterosexual minority that he represents on the commission.\n\nA petition proposing to punish Bolsonaro and signed by Pedro Wilson, Iriny Lopes and Chico Alencar was approved on December 1, 2010. He was defended by Federal Deputy Fernando Chiarelli, who also criticized the booklet drawn up by the Ministry of Education to teach children to socialize with homosexual classmates. Although Bolsonaro's stance was disapproved of by the majority of the commission's members, the parliamentarians opposed the application of punishment.In March 2011, in an interview he gave to Rede Bandeirantes' CQC program, Bolsonaro took a stand against movements that \"advocate\" homosexuality and bisexuality. He said that his son, with a \"good education and a present father\", \"doesn't run the risk\" of becoming homosexual, and that gay parades are \"promoting bad habits\". On April 3, a demonstration was held against his statements. On November 9, 2017, the Rio de Janeiro State Court of Justice ordered Bolsonaro to pay a fine of R$150,000 for collective moral damage due to statements given on the show. Judge Luciana Teixeira said that he had abused his right to free expression to commit an illegal act.\nIn May 2011, after the Supreme Court recognized the stable union of homosexual couples, Jair Bolsonaro said that the \"next step will be the adoption of children [by homosexual couples] and the legalization of pedophilia\", forcing an association between pedophilia and homosexuality. His remarks were mocked on social media after the Supreme Court's decision. Pamphlets attacking homosexual advocates were also scattered around the city of Resende, in Rio de Janeiro, signed by him; the material was available on his website. In October 2011, a lawsuit against Bolsonaro was filed with the Council of Ethics and Parliamentary Decorum by Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL), which accused him of spreading prejudice and encouraging violence and quoted a discussion he had with a female senator about the bill criminalizing homophobia on May 12 in the Senate. It also cites Bolsonaro's participation in the CQC program.\n\nIn an interview for the documentary Out There, made by British actor and comedian Stephen Fry and shown on the BBC in 2013, Bolsonaro said: \"No father is proud to have a gay son ... We Brazilians don't like homosexuals\". In another interview with El País in February 2014, Bolsonaro said that the \"majority\" of homosexuals are \"the result of drug use\". In March 2016, American actor Elliot Page published an interview given by Bolsonaro in 2015 for the documentary series Gaycation. In the article, Page, openly LGBT, claimed to have read an article in which he said that homosexual children should be beaten and asked if Bolsonaro thought he should have been beaten as a child. Bolsonaro replied by saying that the \"growing\" number of openly gay people is due to \"liberalism, drugs and women also working\".\nOn October 6, 2018, Bolsonaro said: \"We're going to make a government for everyone. For gays, and there are even gays who are fathers, gays who are mothers. It's a project for all of you.\" When asked by William Bonner on Jornal Nacional what he would advise those who are prejudiced and aggressive against gays, Bolsonaro replied: \"Aggression against a fellow human being has to be punished according to the law. If the reason is similar, the penalty must be aggravated.\" On August 10, 2019, during the March for Jesus in Brasilia, Bolsonaro classified what he considers \"gender ideology\" as \"something from the devil\" and explained that he would not welcome policies that change the \"traditional family\" without an amendment to the Brazilian constitution. He concluded by saying that, despite being approved, he maintained that the family is composed of a man and a woman, since \"you can't amend the Bible\"\n\n\n==== Jean Wyllys ====\n\nOn April 27, 2011, Bolsonaro became involved in a controversy with openly homosexual Federal Deputy Jean Wyllys (PSOL). At a hearing on public safety, Wyllys allegedly told Justice José Cardozo that \"crime has many causes and one of the causes is hatred, the fruit of racism and prejudice. Stimulating hatred and murder is not freedom of expression\". After criticizing the national human rights plan, Bolsonaro said that he knew parents who \"are ashamed of their gay children\". Interrupted by Manuela d'Ávila (PCdoB), president of the human rights commission, who found the remarks offensive, Bolsonaro denied having offended any parliamentarians. Wyllys admitted feeling offended by Bolsonaro's remarks, who attacked Wyllys by saying: \"That's your problem. I wouldn't be proud to have a son like you\". On leaving the hearing, Minister José Eduardo Cardozo said: \"Human beings should be treated as human beings. People have the right to be whatever they want. We can even disagree, but we must not go around expressing hateful positions, deadly hatred.\"\n\n\n==== School without Homophobia and sex education ====\n\nOn May 11, 2011, Bolsonaro distributed pamphlets in the Senate opposing the \"gay kit\" which, according to him, the Ministry of Education planned to distribute in schools against homophobia  and he considered to be \"promoting homosexuality\". The leaflets against a plan to promote human and LGBT rights were strongly opposed by Senator Marinor Brito (PSOL). She, who defends the criminalization of homophobia and any statement against homosexual conduct, seeing Bolsonaro presenting leaflets to the media, reacted by slapping the papers and demanding to remove them; Bolsonaro reacted by calling her \"heterophobic\". Later, he said: \"Since it's hard to find a male out there, I'm presenting myself as a male and she's all over it. She can't see a heterosexual in front of her. She jinxed me twice: once that I'm married and once that I'm not interested in her. It's very bad, I'm not interested.\" According to journalists, Brito and Bolsonaro almost physically assaulted each other. On the same day, Marinor Brito filed a lawsuit against him. Anthropologist Luis Mott said he would sue Bolsonaro because his pamphlets featured Mott's photo accompanied by phrases that, according to him, were not his own.\n\nIn an interview with Playboy magazine in June 2011, Bolsonaro said: \"I would be incapable of loving a homosexual son. I'm not going to be a hypocrite: I'd rather have my son die in an accident than appear with a man. As far as I'm concerned, he'll have died anyway.\" He also said that if a homosexual couple moved in next door, it would devalue his house. In July of the same year, during an interview with readers of Época magazine, he stated that \"if fighting to prevent the distribution of the 'gay kit' in primary schools with the intention of encouraging homosexuality, in a real affront to the family, is being prejudiced, then I am prejudiced, with great pride\".\nWhen Bolsonaro began campaigning as a pre-candidate for the presidency of Brazil, he adopted a moderate stance towards LGBT people and claimed that he had nothing against homosexuals, but that he was only fighting what he called the \"gay kit\" in schools. On January 11, 2016, he published a video on his official channel that said: \"I have nothing to do with anyone's behavior. If a man or woman later decides to move in with their partner, form a couple, move in with those of the same sex, then they can be happy. But we can't allow children to become homosexuals in the future, or to have this homosexual behavior in the future, due to the influence of the school. That's unacceptable.\" He has maintained his position stating that he has nothing against gays and that he is only fighting the \"gay kit\" in schools.\nOn January 10, 2016, Bolsonaro posted a video on his Facebook page in which he criticized the public school curriculum which, according to him, includes information on homosexuality and sex education. He was referring to the book Le Guide du zizi sexuel, which \"encourages children to take an early interest in sex\" and is being distributed to children as young as 6 years old. The Ministry of Education (MEC) said in a statement on January 15 that it had nothing to do with the book. The same rumor had already circulated in 2013, when it had to be explained that there was no recommendation from the ministry about the book, nor would it be included in the National Textbook Program and the National School Library Program.\nIn 2018, during the presidential election, the Superior Electoral Court (TSE) ordered the removal of videos claiming that the French book Le Guide du zizi sexuel (associated by Bolsonaro with the \"gay kit\") had been distributed by government programs while Fernando Haddad was Minister of Education. The representation targeted Jair Bolsonaro and his sons Carlos and Flávio Bolsonaro. According to Justice Carlos Horbach, the videos constitute \"the dissemination of a fact that is known to be untrue, by the represented candidate and his supporters, in several posts made on social networks\" which \"generates misinformation in the electoral period, with damage to the political debate\". He added that the book was not part of the School without Homophobia program, which was not even implemented by the MEC.\n\n\n=== Racism and xenophobia ===\n\n\n==== Black people ====\n\nBolsonaro disapproves of the application of affirmative action, such as racial quotas for Afro-Brazilians. In 2006, as a protest against the formulation of quota policies in public universities, he presented a supplementary bill in the Chamber of Deputies proposing the establishment of quotas for black and brown deputies, admitting that if the bill came to a vote, it would be against him. In an interview given to the program Custe o Que Custar (CQC) on March 28, 2011, the singer Preta Gil asked him what he would do if his son fell in love with a black girl. Bolsonaro stated that he \"wouldn't discuss promiscuity\" and that he \"doesn't face this risk because his children were very well educated\".\nThe following day, he claimed that his answer had been a \"misunderstanding\". Preta Gil said she will file a complaint with the Public Prosecutor's Office against Bolsonaro for homophobia and racial prejudice. On the same week, Bolsonaro declared that he \"doesn't care about these people\", referring to LGBT movements.\nIn response to the protests against Bolsonaro, his sons Carlos and Flávio Bolsonaro argued that the last statement he made in the interview, in which he classified interracial dating as \"promiscuity\", may have been misinterpreted due to an error in the program's editing. They also said, defending his statements against homosexuality in the family, that being homosexual is not \"normal\" and that the majority of Brazilians agree with Jair Bolsonaro, who defends the integrity of the family and security. Bolsonaro claimed that he assumed the question was about his son's relationship with a homosexual. His children treat all the people who accuse him of being homophobic and racist as \"opportunists\". He justified himself by saying that he was interviewed on a computer and that he didn't understand the last question of the interview.\nBolsonaro announced that he would return to the program to clarify his statements, especially about Preta Gil's question. His comments were considered an \"explicit case of racism\" by Luiza Bairros, chief minister of the Special Secretariat for Policies to Promote Racial Equality. She referred to Bolsonaro's statement on racial quotas and said that freedom of expression cannot be confused with a crime of racial prejudice. According to her, Bolsonaro committed a crime established in the Brazilian constitution. His statements also resonated on social media. A Facebook page with more than 20,000 members protesting against Bolsonaro's alleged statements of homophobia and racism was launched. On Twitter, the hashtag \"#forabolsonaro\" (#bolsonaroout) was among the most commented on of the week. Other websites counted more than twenty-five thousand signatures calling for Bolsonaro's mandate to be revoked.\n\nAfter the interview, originally aired on March 28, 2011, the CQC program replayed the controversial questions from the interview. Bolsonaro said he had understood that the relationship would be with a homosexual and replied that his children were \"very well educated\" and did not live in an environment like Preta Gil had \"unfortunately\" lived in. Rafinha Bastos, one of the show's hosts, assumed that Bolsonaro had based his answer on the lack of a law against homophobia to prevent it from being considered a crime, as it would have been if the answer had been racist. He promised to explain himself publicly.\nSome groups in favor of Bolsonaro protested. A demonstration called on the internet took place on April 9 near São Paulo Museum of Art (MASP) in São Paulo. A group opposed to Bolsonaro, formed by around seventy people, displayed placards and war chants; the group in favor of Bolsonaro had around forty members. Despite the lack of physical aggression, eight members of the group supporting Bolsonaro and two of the group against him were arrested. The former were members of the Ultradefesa, União Nacionalista and Carecas groups, who were investigated for crimes of intolerance, and the latter were anarchist punks who did not carry any documents. A participant in the self-styled \"nationalist\" group had to be removed after arguing with a member of the gay movement. On social media, Bolsonaro supporters called for him to run for president.\nSeveral institutions responsible for promoting human rights have called for Jair Bolsonaro to be investigated and punished. The National Movement for Human Rights demanded punishment for his statements, stating that it was \"perplexed and outraged by the racist and homophobic offenses made by Jair Bolsonaro against Preta Gil, and consequently against both social groups.\" The Brazilian Association of Gays, Lesbians and Transsexuals called for a criminal investigation of Jair Bolsonaro on the grounds of racism and libel. UNESCO called for Bolsonaro's remarks to be investigated. Folha de S. Paulo called for him to be subjected to a political trial for discrimination and prejudice, while opposing his impeachment. The Torture Never Again group published a note repudiating Bolsonaro's speeches.\nThe Brazilian federal government, through the National Council to Combat Discrimination and Promote the Rights of Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals, Transvestites and Transsexuals (CNCD/LGBT), stated that \"Bolsonaro is reinforcing his homophobic, racist and sexist side, deliberately acting with postures incompatible with the decorum and ethics required of a representative of Brazilian society in the National Congress\". According to Luiza Bairros, Minister of Racial Equality, Bolsonaro's statements were \"an explicit case of racism\". Rosana Heringer, coordinator of ActionAid, advocated punishment if he could not be prosecuted under the racism law. The Chamber's Human Rights Commission said it would investigate Bolsonaro for his speeches with discriminatory content. Eloi Ferreira de Araujo, president of the Palmares Foundation, expressed his indignation at Bolsonaro's remarks. \n\nOn April 6, 2011, Bolsonaro skipped a meeting of the Human Rights Commission because, according to his office, he was preparing a defense against accusations of racism for the television interview. On the same day, demonstrators held a protest against Bolsonaro, displaying posters with a caricature of Bolsonaro resembling Adolf Hitler and using the hashtag \"#forabolsonaro\" (#bolsonaroout), adopted on Twitter to promote indignation against his statements. Yann Evanovick, president of the Brazilian Union of High School Students (UBES), stated that \"it is impossible for a country that is theoretically a full democracy to have prejudiced, homophobic and sexist parliamentarians like Bolsonaro\". The National Union of Students and twenty other organizations sent a document to the Human Rights Commission asking for Bolsonaro to be investigated for racism. Marco Maia (PT), president of the Chamber of Deputies, said he was studying the possibility of changing the Chamber's code of ethics to allow for alternative punishments for Bolsonaro. Protesters from groups linked to UNE, indigenous, black and religious movements protested on April 7 at the Federal Chamber, comparing Bolsonaro to Hitler.\nThe CQC interview resulted in Bolsonaro being sued several times for breach of decorum and racism. Preta Gil filed a lawsuit against him for racism, claiming that the statements were clearly racist. On April 6, 2011, he was notified by the Chamber's Internal Affairs Department to present a defense against petitions filed by his peers notifying him of the case. The Federal Government's Council for the Defense of the Human Person decided to forward a formal complaint to the Public Prosecutor's Office about Bolsonaro's alleged racism and homophobia. The Secretariat for Racial Equality and deputies Édson Santos and Luiz Alberto, both from the PT, reiterated the Chamber's request. In 2013, an investigation was opened against Bolsonaro at the STF for allegedly racist statements made against Preta Gil, which was shelved for lack of evidence in 2015, based on the justification that the broadcaster did not make the full recording of the interview available, only the edited version.\n\n\n==== Quilombolas ====\nIn April 2017, in a speech at the Hebraica Club in Rio de Janeiro, Bolsonaro said he would end all indigenous lands and quilombola communities in Brazil if elected in 2018. He also said he would end public funding for NGOs: \"You can be sure that if I get there (presidency of the Republic) there will be no money for NGOs. If it's up to me, every citizen will have a firearm in their home. There won't be a centimeter demarcated for indigenous reserves or quilombolas.\" He also claimed that indigenous and quilombola reserves hinder the economy. \"Where there is indigenous land, there is wealth underneath it. We have to change that.\" After the statement, Bolsonaro was denounced by the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office in Rio de Janeiro, which claimed that he had used insulting, prejudiced and discriminatory expressions with the aim of offending and ridiculing quilombola communities and the black population. On October 3, 2017, he was ordered to pay a fine of R$50,000 for the crime of moral damage.\n\nOn April 13, 2018, the Public Prosecutor's Office filed another complaint against Bolsonaro for the crime of racism, which is non-bailable, imprescriptible and subject to imprisonment for one to three years plus a fine. In the complaint, Prosecutor General Raquel Dodge asks him to pay R$400,000 for collective moral damages and states: \"Jair Bolsonaro treated the members of quilombola communities with total contempt. He referred to them as if they were animals, using the word 'arroba'. This unacceptable manifestation is aligned with the regime of slavery, in which blacks were treated as mere merchandise, and with the idea of inequality between human beings, which is absolutely refuted by the Brazilian Constitution and by all the International Treaties and Conventions to which Brazil is a signatory, confirming equality between human beings as a universal and protected human right. Jair Bolsonaro also said, by comparison, that the Japanese are a hard-working people who don't beg. He showed that, in his view, there are individuals or peoples who are superior to others, treating quilombolas as inferior beings. These statements made by the accused, inciting xenophobic behavior and sentiment, reinforce attitudes of violence and discrimination that are prohibited by the Constitution and criminal law.\" The complaint was rejected by the STF on September 11 of the same year.\n\n\n==== Indigenous peoples ====\n\nJair Bolsonaro has also questioned the Brazilian government's indigenous policy. In one of his speeches to a hearing in the Chamber of Deputies dealing with the issue in Roraima in 2004, he said that the Landless Workers' Movement (MST), \"despite being well-off and made up of people who speak our language and are educated\", is unable to carry out land reform, while \"stinking indigenous, not educated and not speaking our language\" own 12% of Brazilian land and lobby the National Congress. His comments caused great indignation in the plenary among indigenous, parliamentarians and human rights groups, who considered that his speech violated the principle of non-discrimination in the Brazilian Constitution. One of the leaders of the Sateré-Mawé people present at the public hearing threw a glass of water in Bolsonaro's direction. After being hit, he said: \"He's an indigenous man who's in charge here in Brasilia, he's flown in, he's now going to eat a pork chop, have a beer, probably a whiskey, and maybe call someone to make his evening more pleasant. This is the indigenous man who comes here to talk about the indigenous reserve. He should go and eat some grass out there to maintain his origins.\"\n\n\n==== Immigrants ====\nIn September 2015, during an interview with the Opção newspaper in Goiás, Bolsonaro said: \"I don't know what the commanders' adherence is, but if they reduce the number of Armed Forces personnel, it means fewer people on the streets to deal with the MST criminals, the Haitians, Senegalese, Bolivians and all the scum of the earth that are now arriving, including the Syrians. The scum of the earth is arriving in Brazil as if we didn't have enough problems to deal with.\" In a speech at the Hebraica Club in 2017, he said that \"we can't open the doors to everyone\". In April 2017, the Special Secretariat for Policies to Promote Racial Equality issued a statement rejecting his statements on the subject. In 2018, Bolsonaro defended the creation of \"refugee camps\" for Venezuelans seeking shelter in Brazil. In the same interview, when asked if he believed Dilma Rousseff would complete her second term, he wished \"that she ends today, with a heart attack or cancer, [in] any way.\"\n\n\n== Attacks on the press and fake news ==\n\nBolsonaro criticizes the press and the mainstream media, and constantly attacks reporters and critics of his government. A survey by Reporters Without Borders conducted in September 2020 found 53 attacks, including 21 from him. In 2020, Bolsonaro invited Márvio Lúcio, also known as Carioca, to answer journalists' questions when the GDP of 1.1% for his first year in office was released. Carioca offered bananas to the reporters, who stopped asking about the GDP after Bolsonaro insisted on not answering the questions.\nOn October 19, 2018, a lawsuit filed by the Workers' Party (PT) was accepted by the Superior Electoral Court (TSE), with Justice Jorge Mussi as rapporteur. The lawsuit was based on a complaint by the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper, which claimed that companies paid up to R$12 million in contracts for the mass sending of content against Lula (PT) on the WhatsApp application. Based on the allegation that there were practices prohibited by electoral law, such as donations from legal entities and the purchase of user registrations, the PT asked that Bolsonaro be declared ineligible for abuse of economic power and misuse of the media. According to the PT, Bolsonaro's campaign benefited from the proliferation of fake news on social networks. He used Facebook to deny involvement in malicious schemes and accused Folha de S. Paulo of \"working for his rival\" in the second round, Fernando Haddad.\nAccording to a report in Época magazine, a video production company based only on paper in Petrolina received R$240,000 to produce videos for TV and social media for Bolsonaro's campaign. The amount corresponds to around 20% of the total spent on his campaign. The address of the production company, called Mosqueteiros Filmes Ltda, was an empty house with an advertisement for sale whose owners claimed it was rented by the production company.\nIn the 2018 elections, the newspaper O Dia published a satire in which Jair Bolsonaro's head is inserted into a swastika with the question: \"and no one will say anything?\" He filed a lawsuit against the newspaper. The judge in the case ruled in favor of O Dia, arguing that Bolsonaro was not offended when his photo was circulated next to a person dressed up as what appears to be Adolf Hitler. Following his victory in the 2018 elections, the Brazilian Association of Investigative Journalism (Abraji) issued a statement about his statements: \"Abraji receives with apprehension the statements made by the president-elect, Jair Bolsonaro (PSL), regarding the press in the last 48 hours, between the confirmation of his victory at the polls and his first interviews with Brazilian television stations. Respect for the Constitution - to which Bolsonaro will take a solemn oath of obedience on January 1, 2019 - is not complete when the press becomes the object of attacks and threats.\"\nIn March 2019, alongside other associations, the National Association of Newspapers (ANJ) condemned the attitude of Jair Bolsonaro, who helped spread fake news on his social network: \"ABERT, ANER and ANJ point out that the attempt to make the press out to be the enemy ignores the role of independent journalism in monitoring and overseeing the actions of public authorities.\"\nAt a press conference held in May 2019, journalist Marina Dias asked Bolsonaro about the cut in funding for education and he responded by differentiating between a cut and contingency. When Marina again questioned whether it was a cut, he got angry and declared: \"Are you from Folha? (...) First, you people from Folha de S. Paulo have to go back to a good college and do good journalism. That's what Folha has to do, and not hire anyone to be a journalist, to sow discord and ask nonsense around and publish disgusting things.\" Bolsonaro later posted a video of the episode on Twitter and Facebook in which he says: \"(...) Here in the United States, a Folha reporter didn't know the difference between cutting and contingency. We explained.\" Abraji said that by \"stimulating an environment of confrontation and intimidation against journalists and media outlets, Bolsonaro is moving away from the democratic commitment he made when he took office, and is closer to authoritarian rulers, of various ideological hues, who seek to demonize the press because they see it as an obstacle to their power projects. Whenever there are restrictions on freedom of the press and freedom of expression, society is the loser.\"\n\nIn July 2019, he commented that journalist Miriam Leitão was creating a \"lying drama\" about the torture she suffered during Brazil's military dictatorship. He also accused her of attempting to \"impose the dictatorship in Brazil through armed struggle\". Also in 2019, Miriam Leitão's participation in the 13th Jaraguá do Sul Book Fair was canceled. According to the event's organizers, it would not be possible to guarantee her safety after mobilizing a protest by a Jair Bolsonaro sympathizer. In August 2019, the ANJ condemned Bolsonaro's remarks that the press \"is ending\" and the newspaper Valor Econômico \"will close\".\nIn September 2019, ANJ said that the provisional measure (MP) 896 proposed by Jair Bolsonaro is an attack on press freedom. It also reported that the MP will lead to a lack of transparency in public acts and bypasses Congress, which is responsible for legislating on the subject. It also eliminates the requirement for official public bidding documents to be published in widely circulated newspapers. The government claimed that the measure was aimed at cutting an \"unjustified expense for the public coffers\". On another occasion, Jair Bolsonaro said that the MP was a response to the press being critical of his government. Justice Gilmar Mendes of the Supreme Federal Court (STF) suspended MP 896 on October 18, 2019, until it is voted on in Congress. He argued that the MP violates press freedom.\nIn November 2019, the National Federation of Journalists (FENAJ) reported that Jair Bolsonaro had already accumulated 99 attacks on the press in Brazil, mainly directed at Rede Globo. In December 2019, a survey by Piauí magazine's Agência Lupa showed that 64.5% of the occasions Bolsonaro used the word \"fake news\" were with the intention of attacking the press. In January 2020, when FENAJ released a new survey showing that Bolsonaro was responsible for most of the attacks on the press, he responded ironically on social media with laughter and said: \"They took the average IQ of the press. It was 58\". In 2020, the Brazilian Association of Investigative Journalism, Conectas Human Rights, the Vladimir Herzog Institute and the Intervozes collective denounced some of Bolsonaro's attacks on journalists at the United Nations (UN).\nIn April 2020, Reporters Without Borders announced the quarterly release of analyses of Bolsonaro's attacks on the press. In the first part, the organization reported on how he attacks and tries to silence the press alongside family members. In the same month, Folha de S. Paulo compiled some of the false statements made by Bolsonaro since his inauguration, and Agência Pública published an investigation showing how the public positioning of Bolsonaro and allies against social isolation was used as a strategy to remove Minister of Health Luiz Henrique Mandetta from office using false information on social media. In early May 2020, journalist Bruno Boghossian noted that Bolsonaro was forcing friction against the STF to divert public attention from political interference in Federal Police. The following month, Veja magazine listened to several experts to analyze the way Bolsonaro used speeches in 80 days of the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the examples cited in the report was that of John F. Kennedy, who mentioned Winston Churchill, who put speeches ahead of war.\nOn June 27, 2020, Folha de S.Paulo published in an article some of the phrases that bring Bolsonaro closer to the generals of the dictatorship. On July 7, 2020, the Brazilian Press Association (ABI) declared that it would file a criminal complaint with the Supreme Court against Bolsonaro after he claimed to be infected with COVID-19 and approached journalists for an interview. During the conversation, he removed the mask from his face. As a result, the Union of Professional Journalists of the Federal District has asked media outlets to suspend their coverage of the Planalto Palace. In the same month, Bolsonaro had told the press more than 46 times that the Supreme Court is preventing him from fighting the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, which is false.\nBolsonaro's undemocratic political attitudes as president of the republic have been reported and criticized in opinion articles written by the editorials of major newspapers in Brazil. In November 2019, the Folha de S. Paulo editorial stated: \"Jair Bolsonaro does not understand and will never understand the limits that the Republic imposes on the exercise of the Presidency. He is a personality who combines levity and authoritarianism. (...) The Planalto Palace is not an extension of the house in Barra da Tijuca that Bolsonaro keeps in Rio de Janeiro. (...) The rules of the democratic rule of law will then have to be imposed on him from the outside, like the limits given to a child.\" On February 26, 2020, Estado de S. Paulo said: \"Bolsonaro seems to be trying to build a military-inspired populist regime, very much to the taste of those who miss the dictatorship and reminiscent of the government of General Velasco Alvarado in Peru, who harassed parties because he considered them part of the oligarchic system.\" The newspaper O Globo said that Bolsonaro has been acting \"like the head of a radical faction, a gang, going beyond all the limits of democratic coexistence. He disregards the division of powers established by the Constitution, threatens Congress, the Judiciary and, therefore, its Supreme Court.\"\nOn January 18, 2021, Jair Bolsonaro blocked the information verification agency Aos Fatos on Twitter. According to Vitor Blotta, a professor at the University of São Paulo who coordinates the Journalism, Law and Freedom group (ECA-USP), politicians who use their social networks for government functions should not block journalists, because according to the Federal Constitution, advertising the programs, works, services and campaigns of public bodies is the duty of the public administration. On May 17, 2021, Aos Fatos reported that Bolsonaro has made 3,000 false or distorted statements since the beginning of his term, with a total average of 3.4 statements per day. It also published in early January 2022 that throughout 2021 Bolsonaro made an average of 6.9 false or distorted statements per day. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been 1,278 declarations since he took office.\nOn October 21, 2021, during his live internet broadcasts, Bolsonaro used a printed newspaper as a source to claim that immunized people are more likely to be infected with AIDS. The COVID-19 CPI included his statement in the report and transferred new evidence about Bolsonaro's alleged crimes to STF Minister Alexandre de Moraes for the Fake News Inquiry. Minister Luís Roberto Barroso of the STF was chosen to be the rapporteur of the inquiry filed by the PSOL and PDT parties.\nThe live was taken down by Facebook and YouTube for violating health disinformation policies against COVID-19. Robert Gallo, one of the discoverers of HIV, denied his statement in an interview with Correio Braziliense. Bolsonaro based his comment on an article on the Exame newspaper reporting on the risk of using Adenoviridae number 5 in vaccines, given that in 2007, similar vaccines containing the virus were created and increased the risk of HIV contamination. In the same article, it is reported that the vaccines being manufactured did not contain adenovirus number 5, and that the study was a warning to avoid using this virus in vaccines.\n\n\n== COVID-19 pandemic ==\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, the Minister of Health, followed the guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO) by adopting social distancing with the aim of \"flattening the curve\" of contagion and preventing the collapse of the health system. However, Jair Bolsonaro's response was widely criticized after he minimized the effects of the disease, defended treatments without proven efficacy and postponed the purchase of vaccines, as well as clashing with governors for disagreeing with social distancing measures. As a result, the Federal Senate set up the COVID-19 CPI, a Parliamentary Inquiry Commission to investigate the actions and omissions of public authorities in combating the pandemic.\n\n\n=== Covid kit ===\n\nThe Covid kit, often referred to as early treatment, is a designation used to describe the negationist approach promoted by the government led by Jair Bolsonaro and his supporters regarding the use of drugs that have no proven efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. It includes advocating the use of drugs such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, azithromycin, bromhexine, nitazoxanide, anticoagulants and zinc supplements.\nIn March 2020, chloroquine emerged as a possible treatment of COVID-19 based on two studies of questionable quality. Former US President Donald Trump endorsed one of these studies, defying the recommendations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which led to the politicization of the issue. In Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro adopted the same discourse. In subsequent months, the Brazilian government launched measures to promote chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as treatments for COVID-19, which included the ordering of production, coordination of distribution and a considerable expenditure of approximately R$90 million on the acquisition of the medicines. The Ministry of Health, under the leadership of Eduardo Pazuello, has also expanded the use of these substances to treat mild cases of the disease.\nThe Covid kit created a false sense of security among the population, suggesting that life could return to its previous state without the need for social isolation measures. The widespread use of the drugs, along with their potential side effects, has caused significant damage to the kidneys and liver of many users. The initiative resulted in an increase in the number of infections, hospitalizations and deaths, and was criticized by organizations and health experts for its lack of scientific basis and the potential dangerousness associated with its use. It has also become the subject of lawsuits and investigations related to possible favoritism involving public and private agents in search of financial gain.\n\n\n== Environment ==\n\nIn October 2016, Bolsonaro took part in an event in Brasilia in support of the release of vaquejada by the Supreme Federal Court (STF).\n\n\n=== Agriculture and climate change ===\nAccording to The Washington Post, \"Bolsonaro is a powerful defender of agribusiness ... and is likely to favor profits over conservation ... and is likely to favor profits over preservation ... He has chafed at foreign pressure to protect [the Amazon rainforest] and has told international nonprofits like the World Wildlife Fund that he will not tolerate their agendas in Brazil. He has also strongly opposed the demarcation of indigenous reserves for native peoples. His advisors say he plans to expand nuclear and hydroelectric power generation in the Amazon.\" He considered the possibility of abolishing the Ministry of the Environment, but backed down. However, the Environmental Education department of the Ministry of the Environment was incorporated into the Ecotourism Secretariat, while the Brazilian Forestry Service was transferred from the Ministry of the Environment to Agriculture.\nIn April 2019, Bolsonaro was selected by Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. The magazine describes him as a complex character, who would represent a break in a decade-long sequence of corruption and the \"best chance in a generation\" to pass economic reforms that can tame the growing debt. It also highlights his controversial character, describing him as a symbol of \"toxic masculinity\" and \"homophobic ultraconservatism\", which could even reverse Brazil's progress on climate change.\n\n\n=== Amazon fires ===\n\nDuring August 2019, fires in the Amazon rainforest became the focus of intense criticism of Bolsonaro's rainforest policies. In 2019, Brazil registered more than 72,000 fires, an increase of 84% compared to the same period in 2018. In five days in August, there were 7,746 fires. The alarm led Angela Merkel to support Emmanuel Macron's request to put the Amazon fires on the agenda of the G7 summit, after he said the situation represented an international crisis. In response, Jair Bolsonaro accused Macron of having a \"colonialist mentality\" and told him to stay out of Brazilian politics. Subsequently, Bolsonaro's government launched a global public relations campaign to try to convince the world that everything is under control. He said that \"in my view it may have been boosted by NGOs, because they lost money, what is the intention? To bring problems to Brazil\", pointing out that Leonardo DiCaprio gave the money to burn the Amazon.\n\n\n== Other controversies ==\n\n\n=== Economy ===\n\nDuring the governments of Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Bolsonaro defended developmentalist and anti-liberal economic positions, and voted with the Workers' Party (PT) on different economic issues. In 2000, when explaining to presenter Jô Soares why he advocated the firing squad for former President Fernando Henrique, he said that \"it's barbaric to privatize Vale and telecommunications, to hand over our oil reserves to foreign capital\".\nSince 2016, Bolsonaro has supported liberal economic measures. He voted to expand the pre-salt layer, said that the \"free market is the mother of freedom\", and, in an interview, stated that \"as much as possible should be privatized\" and that he was only opposed to the way Vale was privatized. In an interview with journalist Mariana Godoy, when asked about his position on the macroeconomic structure, he replied that his economic team would be the ones to talk about the issue for him in the future. In November 2017, during an interview, Bolsonaro said that if he became president of Brazil, he would appoint liberal economist Paulo Guedes to the Ministry of Finance. In a 2018 interview, he said that he \"wouldn't like\" to privatize Petrobras, but that he would do so if he \"couldn't find [another] solution\". In May 2018, he defended the flexibilization of labor rights and said: \"Little by little, the population will understand that less rights and employment is better than all rights and unemployment.\"\n\n\n=== Science and technology ===\nDuring his campaign, Bolsonaro proposed eliminating the Ministries of Science and Technology and the Environment. The budget submitted at the beginning of 2019 maintained support of around 3 billion, which is around 45% lower than funding in 2017. In March, the government announced a 42% budget freeze for the Ministry of Science and Communication, leaving it with only R$2.9 billion for the rest of the year. On July 19, Bolsonaro accused National Institute for Space Research (INPE) of lying about the figures and suggested that his government had the right to approve INPE's scientific data before it was released to the public. Ricardo Galvão, an MIT-trained physicist, criticized Bolsonaro's \"vile and cowardly attitude\"\nIn June, he suspended the release of R$8 billion from the education, science and technology budgets as part of austerity measures, leaving thousands of researchers without research grants. In April, the number of visas granted to Brazilians for extraordinary ability, or those with higher degrees, rose to 159% in 2018 and 408% in 2017. The current exodus includes \"doctors, nutritionists, engineers, commercial pilots, IT specialists, architects, economists, journalists and entrepreneurs\".\n\n\n=== Birth control ===\nBolsonaro provoked considerable controversy for public statements made in July 2008, when he proposed providing the poorest with birth control methods by suggesting that they were poorly educated to understand family planning education. He stated:I would like Brazil to have a family planning program. It's not even worth talking about education when most of these [poor] people aren't prepared to be educated, so they won't educate themselves. Only strict birth control can save us from chaos. An educated man and woman would hardly want an extra child for the sole purpose of engaging in a welfare program (as it is today). We need to adopt a strict birth control policy. We can no longer make demagogic speeches, proposing laws and means of government to support these poor people who are increasingly proliferating throughout the country. [...] People who aren't prepared to have children shouldn't have them. That's what I stand for and I'm not worried about getting votes in the future. It's past time to discuss a policy to curb this demographic explosion, otherwise we'll continue to vote in this Chamber only on issues such as Bolsa Família, loans for the poor, gas vouchers, etc. [Birth control] Methods have to be provided for those who, unfortunately, are ignorant and don't have the means to control their children. Because we [as the upper middle class] are able to control our own. Poor people can't control [theirs].On August 9, 2019, when answering a question about the possibility of development with environmental preservation, Bolsonaro said: \"You just have to stop eating a little less. When it comes to environmental pollution, you just have to poop every other day and it improves our lives a lot too, right?\" He also pointed out that 70 million people are born in the world every year and then defended a family planning policy as a way of combating pollution. \"It's not control, you'll see on the front page of Folha tomorrow that I'm saying there has to be birth control. It's family planning. People who have more culture have fewer children. I'm an exception to the rule, I have five, right? But, as a rule, that's it,\" he said.\n\n\n=== Professional associations ===\nJair Bolsonaro is against the OAB exam, the test required for law graduates to practice law. In 2007, when he was a federal deputy, he proposed a bill to abolish the exam. At the end of 2018, when he had already been elected to the presidency, he made a statement saying that making the exam compulsory would turn law graduates into \"luxury law firm boys\". The OAB issued a statement claiming that the exam is \"an important means of gauging the quality of law teaching\", and that it is common practice in several countries. In 2020, Bolsonaro accused the exam of being a \"nickel-and-dime scam\", and that if it were up to him, \"the OAB card would not be required to practice law\".\nIn 2019, the Ministry of the Economy drafted a constitutional amendment (PEC) to end the obligation for professionals to register with professional association, establishing that the regulation of professions \"will only take place if there is a risk of concrete damage to life, health, safety or social order\". The OAB issued a statement saying that the PEC \"takes away one of the most important instruments for defending society in professional supervision\", and that \"it is essentially an attack on mechanisms that protect citizens\". In August 2019, the Parliamentary Front in Support of Professional Councils, composed of 200 deputies and opposed to the PEC, was created. At the end of the year, the proposal was withdrawn by the government according to Federal Deputy Rogério Correia (PT-MG). The PEC's rapporteur, Federal Deputy Édio Lopes (PL-RR), said that a new proposal would be sent to Congress with a \"more conciliatory\" tone regarding the interests of the government and the professional councils.\n\n\n=== Golden shower controversy ===\n\nOn March 5, 2019, Bolsonaro published a pornographic video on his Twitter account showing a man inserting his finger into his anus and bending down for someone else to urinate on him. Bolsonaro suggested that this was something common at Brazilian Carnival. The next day, he posted the question: \"O que é golden shower?\" (\"What is golden shower?\"). The term refers to sexual acts that involve urinating on one's partner. The post was criticized by both Bolsonaro's supporters and critics, and several users reported that they would report the video to Twitter for inappropriate content. Some users noted that Bolsonaro had made public topics that he himself had always considered inappropriate for mass circulation.\nThe question published by Bolsonaro had international repercussions and was reported in the US newspaper The New York Times, the British newspapers The Independent and The Guardian, Paraguay's Última Hora, Argentina's Infobae, Mexico's Excelsior, Spain's El País and France's Le Monde. On March 19, the lawyers of the pair who appeared in the video filed a writ of mandamus with the Supreme Federal Court (STF), demanding that Bolsonaro delete the publications. Two days later, the posts were deleted.\nIn June 2019, Folha de S. Paulo published the article \"De 'golden shower' a piada com japoneses, obsessão fálica marca Bolsonaro\" (\"From 'golden shower' to joke with Japanese, phallic obsession marks Bolsonaro\"), in which experts commented on Bolsonaro's fixation with genitals and sexuality. Psychoanalyst and columnist Contardo Calligaris commented: \"If Bolsonaro was appalled by that situation, it's because something resonates with him. Not that he fantasized about doing it [the golden shower], but the possible sexual dimension of it appeared to him somewhere to the point of arousing him.\" In July 2021, Carlos José Marques, editorial director, evaluated Bolsonaro's language, saying: \"His expressions are abject by nature, from the anthological 'golden shower', which he greeted as soon as he took office [...] From the 'golden shower' to the personalized 'poop' on himself, it was a scatological succession of foul language and mental garbage that assaults and causes disgust.\"\n\n\n=== Venezuelan women controversy ===\nIn an interview with the FEAT. Podcast on October 14, 2022, Bolsonaro said that he \"got in the mood\" when he saw girls between fourteen and fifteen years old riding by on a motorcycle in São Sebastião, an administrative region of the Federal District. He also implied that they were prostitutes. The incident took place on April 10, 2021, and the video had a wide repercussion on social media. Some comments on Twitter linked the president's speech to pedophilia, since the girls are underage. The term \"Bolsonaro Pedófilo\" (\"Bolsonaro Pedophile\") reached the top of the most commented subjects on the platform. Opponents also questioned why Bolsonaro didn't call in the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office, the Federal Police or the Guardianship Council when he saw teenagers in a situation of suspected child prostitution. Several politicians and personalities repudiated the statements.\n\n\n== Ineligibility ==\n\nBefore his election to the presidency, Jair Bolsonaro became a consistent critic of Brazil's voting machine. In 2015, when he was a federal deputy, he drafted a constitutional amendment, approved by the Chamber of Deputies, which provided for printed ballots in Brazil. Later, the amendment was rejected by the Supreme Court and not implemented in the 2018 elections, based on the understanding that it could cause a risk of a breach of secrecy and freedom of choice, due to the possibility of poll workers having to intervene in case of printing failure. During the 2022 presidential elections, Bolsonaro and his supporters adopted the tactic of questioning the electronic ballot boxes in order to challenge the legitimacy of the elections if they were defeated.\nOn July 18, 2022, during a meeting with ambassadors, Jair Bolsonaro spread conspiracy theories about the electronic ballot boxes and repeated untrue statements made in previous years and previously contested by electoral bodies. Among the assertions denied by the press and the Superior Electoral Court (TSE), he claimed that a hacker had access to the TSE system and could manipulate the electronic ballot boxes; that the TSE did not collaborate with the Federal Police investigation; that an audit, hired by the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) in 2014, concluded that the electronic ballot boxes cannot be audited; that international observers could not guarantee the legitimacy of the election; that the re-totaling of votes would be done by a third-party company; that the TSE did not accept suggestions from the Armed Forces; that the electronic ballot box would complete the vote with the number \"3\", as soon as the voter pressed the number \"1\", in order for the vote \"13\" to be counted for the opposition candidate.\nHe also tried to delegitimize the TSE and claimed that Justice Fachin was a lawyer for the Landless Workers' Movement (MST). According to The New York Times, the meeting raised international concern about a possible coup d'état in Brazil, as Bolsonaro suggested that the solution to the problems mentioned would be to intensify the military's involvement in the electoral process. The meeting was broadcast on public broadcaster TV Brasil and on his profiles on social media. The New York Times compared Bolsonaro's tactics to Donald Trump's stance in the 2020 US presidential election, when he tried to delegitimize the vote before it took place.\n\n\n== Military crisis ==\n\nIn March 2021, a military crisis was unleashed when Brazil's highest military authorities resigned in response to Jair Bolsonaro's attempts to politicize the Armed Forces. Since the beginning of his government, Bolsonaro has appointed several military personnel to civilian positions, seeking to receive support in return, including through public demonstrations in favor of his government's policies and against the measures adopted by the governors to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as defending the enactment of the State of emergency in order to increase his powers.\nOn March 29, after being dismissed by Bolsonaro, Fernando Azevedo e Silva, the Minister of Defense, declared that he had preserved the Armed Forces as \"state institutions.\" The following day, commanders Edson Pujol (Army), Ilques Barbosa (Navy) and Antonio Carlos Moretti Bermudez (Air Force) resigned. The collective resignation of the commanders sought to demonstrate their opposition to any political interference by the military. However, the crisis has raised concerns about the politicization of the Armed Forces and the possibility of Bolsonaro planning a self-coup.\n\n\n== See also ==\nConservatism in Brazil\nNew Right\nPolitics of Brazil\nEle Não movement\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAbreu, Alzira Alves de (2006).

He served as the party's nominee when it contested the 2011 presidential election. Alloycious Dennis Wolloh served as his running mate. He received 13,612 votes, 1.1% of the total. In the subsequent runoff election, the LTP joined the Congress for Democratic Change, along with several other opposition parties, in withdrawing from the electoral process, alleging fraud. In 2011, the LTP won no seats in the Senate, but won one in the House of Representatives. Emerson V. Kamara was elected to represent Grand Cape Mount's 3rd House district.\nThe party won no seats in the 2014 Senate election.\nSandy ran again with the LTP in the 2017 presidential election. His running mate was Victoria Morris Tweh. Sandy attempted to withdraw from the election in 2017, due to his involvement with the Constitution Review Committee, however the National Elections Commission did not permit him to so late in the election, due to a section of the Election Law. He received 5,343 votes, 0.3% of the total. Rep. Kamara was re-elected with the Coalition for Democratic Change instead of the LTP. Rep. Samuel G. Karmo (Bomi-1), who was elected with the Unity Party in 2011, ran with the LTP in 2017, though he was not re-elected. Rustonlyn S. Dennis was elected in Montserrado's 4th House district.\nThe party won no seats in the 2020 Senate election.\nThe LTP did not contest the 2023 presidential election. Rep. Dennis unsuccessfully contested re-election as an independent. The LTP again won no seats in the Senate.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "To Catch a Copper is a 2024 British documentary series about investigations into officer misconduct within the Avon and Somerset Police. The series has three episodes, which are themed around mental health, race, and sex crimes. Concerns include use of force and racial profiling. In one case, a constable is fired after publishing revenge porn; in another, an officer is acquitted after having sex on duty with an intoxicated woman.\nThe series aired on Channel 4 after four years of filming in collaboration with the Counter-Corruption Unit, who received complaints and sometimes referred them to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). The filmmakers intended to make a non-fiction programme in the style of the fictional police procedural Line of Duty, but came to the conclusion that there were systemic issues in the police misconduct process. They also heard that many incidents went unreported due to mistrust in the system.\nAfter its release, the Police Federation surveyed local officers and found that most opposed Chief Constable Sarah Crew's co-operation with the documentary, which she believed would increase public trust in policing. Reviewers believed that the documentary raised concerns over policing. External criticisms include the CEO of the sexual abuse charity SARSAS, who said specialist training was needed, and the Independent Scrutiny of Police Powers Panel, who said misconduct procedures \"protect the police rather than the public\".\n\n\n== Series overview ==\nThe documentary series follows the Counter-Corruption Unit of the Avon and Somerset Police. During the four years of filming, 5,000 complaints are filed: 4,000 result in no action; 43 officers are dismissed; three officers are convicted on criminal charges. The series has three episodes, which are themed around mental health, race and sex crimes, respectively. They aired weekly from Monday 29 January 2024, in a 9 p.m. timeslot.\nOne woman is arrested under the grounds of disturbing the peace after police assess that she is attempting to jump from the Clifton Suspension Bridge. She is restrained by two female officers with a hand to her throat, a spit hood, and use of PAVA spray at close range. At the police station, she is pinned down and searched as she screams. The level of force used in this case is questioned by a Counter-Corruption Unit officer. In another incident, recorded on body camera footage, police are called to stop a disabled and mentally ill woman from leaving hospital during a crisis. Officers laugh about her allegedly urinating on herself and one says, \"fucking bitch\". Chief Constable Sarah Crew states her concerns with the incidents depicted and hopes for reform. One officer tells filmmakers that it is difficult to continually engage with vulnerable individuals experiencing mental health crises.\nThe documentary shows the potential racial profiling of a man who is \"stopped and searched\", assaulted, arrested, and strip searched. In a separate case, a young, black woman on a bus is PAVA sprayed while holding her toddler close to her in an incident involving six officers. A black man reports head and neck pain, confusion, and loss of balance as he is taken into custody. He is refused medical attention despite his symptoms of brain bleeding. An ambulance is called three hours after he collapses and vomits in a cell.\nConstable Dave Lovell is found to have committed gross misconduct by an internal investigation over three instances of revenge porn involving different women. His pattern of sending images of his genitals to co-workers were well known within the force; he had continued as an officer after five investigations into his behaviour, with a verbal warning in 2006 and a written warning in 2016. Additionally, a female police community support officer (PCSO) accuses a male PCSO twice her age of sexual assault by groping. The female PCSO said she joined the police to \"make positive change\" after they had failed to resolve domestic violence in her childhood.\nThe officer Lee Cocking had sex on duty with an intoxicated woman on 24 December 2017 after offering to drive her home safely. Investigation into his conduct was previously reported in the media. The documentary reports his acquittal in a criminal misconduct trial and an internal police misconduct process. Cocking says that the drunk woman initiated sex and PTSD caused his passivity, in a defence that another officer calls \"farcical\". During the investigations, he is suspended on full pay for around five years. Afterwards, he retires on a full pension.\nSome incidents are referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), who have the power to remove officers from their jobs. In 2022, of 81,000 complaints against the UK police, under 1% led to misconduct proceedings. Overall, the programme features cases involving 16 officers and one PCSO. Two of these people were dismissed. Of the others, the police stated that three resigned, one retired, nine are \"put on reflective practice\" and two people are not found to have engaged in misconduct. Possible criminal assault in the Clifton Suspension Bridge incident was not referred to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe filmmakers Hugo Pettitt and Ashley Francis-Roy, who served as director, pitched the series to Channel 4 in 2020 as a documentary in the style of Line of Duty, a BBC police procedural based in the fictional Anti-Corruption Unit 12 (AC-12). Pettitt commented that they expected to find \"an enjoyable journey of officers solving cases and crimes, rooting out individual officers\", but according to Francis-Roy they discovered \"a misconduct process that was unfit for purpose in addressing seriously concerning behaviour\". The production company Story Films collected footage for four years. During this time, the murder of Sarah Everard by the constable Wayne Couzens and the prosecution of the serial rapist and police officer David Carrick led to public concern over police misconduct. A subsequent report by Louise Casey, Baroness Casey of Blackstock, found that the police were institutionally racist, misogynistic,  and homophobic.\nDocumentary-makers in the genre often rely on police departments continuing to allow them filming access. Such programmes include 24 Hours in Police Custody, The Met: Policing London, and The Force. In Pettitt's case, work on Drugsland and the U.S. 24 Hours in Police Custody aided negotiation. According to the journalist Duncan Campbell, media coverage of police became more positive in the mid-1990s due to increased litigation by the Police Federation. Pettitt suggested he may previously have been guilty of accepting police accounts uncritically.\nFrancis-Roy said they produced a different style of documentary from these non-fiction series about policing, which he felt \"tell stories of investigations with police heroes\" as entertainment. The Channel 4 commissioner Sacha Mirzoeff said that other series suffer from covering cases retrospectively. The filmmakers were influenced instead by the 1982 documentary series Police. In one episode of Police, \"A Complaint of Rape\", a woman reporting rape is interrogated about her mental health, sex life and reproductive system, before officers decide she is lying.\n\nChief Constable Sarah Crew—the first woman to hold that position after her November 2021 appointment—is featured in the documentary. She stated in June 2023 that the police were institutionally racist. A recent predecessor of hers resigned due to inappropriate conduct towards junior female officers. Crew said that the documentary showed the force was confronting its issues. She hoped it would \"improve trust and confidence\" and the \"ability to police by consent\". A member of the Professional Standards Department who is featured said that, from her 21 years' experience, \"the culture that once existed is no longer acceptable\". Mark Shelford, the local Police and Crime Commissioner, said the \"very courageous\" decision to allow filming accompanied an increase in misconduct cases, which showed the system worked.\nPettitt said members of the public were reluctant to participate as filmmakers were seen \"as another arm of the police\". Francis-Roy commented that the police's reaction to incidents in the programme was \"a million miles away\" from the community response and that victims often saw complaints as a \"pointless exercise\". Francis-Roy said they heard from many people who did not report incidents due to mistrust of the Professional Standards Department.\n\n\n== Responses ==\nSpokespeople for the Avon and Somerset Police said that since the documentary was filmed, \"significant changes\" were made to the misconduct process and that officers had received additional training. They described implementing a new approach to sexual offence investigations, Operation Bluestone. Crew commented that \"recovery work\" was needed to counteract falling public trust in police, that police misconduct was the \"exception\", that transparency was \"right\" and that removal of a \"minority of wrongdoers\" required \"concerted effort\" from all officers.\nThe Police Federation concluded, from surveying 400 members of the Avon and Somerset Police, that most officers opposed the force's co-operation with the documentary-makers and felt \"utterly betrayed\" and \"unsupported\". The vice-chair said that the police is \"the most accountable of public services\" and \"fairness and balance\" is needed when scrutinising policing. The local chair said that police were increasingly summoned to incidents they had not been trained to deal with, such as mental health crises, and that investigations into officers were increasingly biased towards dismissal \"to bring back public confidence\".\nDesmond Brown, chair of the force's Lammy Group (set up in response to The Lammy Review), said that he was \"appalled, angry, but, unfortunately, not surprised\" by the issues depicted, as they had been present since he joined and \"did not seem to be going anywhere\".\nThe CEO of the sexual abuse charity SARSAS said in reaction that systemic change, additional vetting processes and specialist training by sexual violence services was needed within the police. She connected this to the charity's experience that most people they work with do not feel they can make police reports \"for fear of not being believed or taken seriously\", or have \"negative experiences with the police\".\nThe Independent Scrutiny of Police Powers Panel (ISOPPP), a volunteer organisation set up by the Avon and Somerset Police, said that \"radical overhaul\" of the system was needed as the Professional Standards Department and IOPC \"protect the police rather than the public\", which undermines the principle of policing by consent.\nThe programme garnered ratings of four stars in The Daily Telegraph, and three stars in The Guardian. Gerard Gilbert of i found the series \"eye-opening\". Writing in the Irish Independent, Pat Stacey commented that the \"hardworking\" Counter-Corruption Unit are limited in jurisdiction and asked: \"How rotten does a rotten apple have to be before it's thrown out?\" Similarly, Deputy Mayor Asher Craig told the Royal Television Society that the IOPC is \"marking their own homework\" without outside scrutiny. In The Times, Sean O'Neill said the system appeared \"slow, bureaucratic and broken\". The Daily Telegraph reviewer Anita Singh did not believe the programme would increase public trust in the police. After the first episode, The Guardian's Jack Seale wrote that the series should make a \"more focused\" argument for police reform.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sir John MacDougall KCB (1790 – 12 April 1865) was a Scottish Royal Navy vice admiral.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMacDougall was born in 1790. He was the second son of Patrick MacDougall of Dunolly Castle, Argyllshire, lineal representative of the MacDougalls of Lorne, by his wife Louisa, youngest daughter of John Campbell of Achallader in Argyllshire. His elder brother, Alexander, captain in the 5th regiment of foot, was killed in 1812, at the storming of Ciudad Rodrigo. John MacDougall entered the navy in December 1802, on board the Cruiser sloop, actively employed on the north coast of France through 1803. In he was in the Doris frigate with his cousin, Patrick Campbell. When the Doris was burnt, January 1805, he was appointed to the Hero, in which he was present in the action off Cape Finisterre, 22 July 1805. He was afterwards again with Patrick Campbell in the Chiffonne, and in the Unité from June 1806 to November 1809, during which time he was repeatedly engaged in boat actions in the Adriatic. On 25 Novembee 1809 he was promoted by Lord Collingwood to be lieutenant of the Ville de Paris, a promotion confirmed by the admiralty on 3 January 1810. Li May 1811 he was again appointed to the Unité, which under the command of Captain Chamberlayne still formed part of the squadron in the Adriatic. The service was very severe, and MacDougall was, as before, frequently engaged in boat actions. In November 1811 he was in command of a prize to take her to Malta, when he fell in with three French sums of war. 'With a judgment and zeal which did him infinite credit' he returned to communicate his intelligence to the senior officer, Captain Murray Maxwell, with the result that two of the French ships were captured. Towards the end of 1812 he was invalided from the Unité; in 1814 he was in the Leander on the coast of North America; and in 1816 was a lieutenant of the Superb with Captain Ekins, at the bombardment of Algiers, 27 August In 1819 he was flag-lieutenant to Rear-admiral Donald Campbell in the West Indies, and was officially thanked by the king of Denmark, through the lords of the admiralty, for his conduct in saving the crew of a Danish ship wrecked in a hurricane at St. Thomas. He was promoted to be commander on 9 February 1820.\nFrom 1833 to 1835 he commanded the Nimrod on the coast of Portugal, and was promoted to be captain 16 August 1836. In February 1845 he commissioned the Vulture, paddle-wheel frigate, for the East India station, and in April 1847, being then senior officer at Hongkong, escorted the governor, Sir John Francis Davis, with a strong body of troops up the river to Canton, capturing the Bogue forts on the way, spiking upwards of five hundred guns and destroying the ammunition (Bulletins of State Intelligence, 1847, p. 262). It would appear that the Chinese were taken unawares, and that the forts were not garrisoned to their proper strength. He returned to England in 1848. He had no farther service, but was promoted to be rear-admiral on 12 May 1857; was nominated a K.C.B. on 10 November 1862; attained the rank of vice-admiral 3 November 1863; and died at Dunolly on 12 April 1865. He married in 1826 Elizabeth Sophia, only daughter of Commander Charles Sheldon Timins of the royal navy, and had issue, among others, Colonel Charles Allan, the present laird of Dunolly, Patrick Charles Campbell, who died a commander in the navy in 1861, and Somerled, now a captain on the retired list.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1893). \"MacDougall, John\".

        "content": "Joseph L. Falson is an Australian-American materials scientist and expert in highly crystalline materials and molecular beam epitaxy. Falson is an assistant professor of Materials Science and William H. Hurt Scholar at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).\nFalson is known for his discovery of a two-dimensional superconducting material that defies conventional theories by retaining its superconductivity under strong magnetic fields.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life and education ===\nFalson was born in Australia and raised in Port Macquarie, New South Wales, where he developed an interest in the physical properties of materials during his early education. He pursued this interest at the University of New South Wales, where he completed his undergraduate studies in chemistry. He then travelled internationally, where he earned a MSc degree from Tohoku University before earning a scholarship from the Japanese government to conduct research at the University of Tokyo under Masashi Kawasaki. There, he studied crystal growth and condensed matter physics and earned his PhD in materials science.\nFollowing his doctoral work, Falson continued his studies in Germany at the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research where he researched low-temperature transport with Jürgen Smet and Klaus von Klitzing before eventually joining Caltech as an assistant professor in 2020.\n\n\n== Research ==\nFalson's research is rooted in the study of quantum mechanical ground states within highly crystalline materials, a branch in condensed matter science that seeks to understand the principles of emergence and topology. Falson's approach is to design novel materials from the ground up, aiming to create platforms that are experimentally accessible and demonstrate unique electrical, optical, and thermal phenomena. The primary technique he employs is thin-film epitaxy, a process of depositing single-atomic layers of material onto crystalline substrates to build high-quality crystals with minimal defects. His laboratory specializes in using molecular beam epitaxy, a method that evaporates elements in a vacuum to form a beam that condenses on a substrate, constructing complex layered crystals on an atomic scale.\nThe materials synthesized in Falson's lab are often studied under extreme conditions—high magnetic fields, high pressures, and very low temperatures—to discern their chemical, structural, electronic, and optical properties. By custom-designing experimental apparatus, his lab extracts detailed thermodynamic data from these materials, which in turn informs and refines the growth process to enhance the quality of the crystals produced.\nA significant focus of Falson's research is on the phenomenon of superconductivity, particularly in materials that maintain superconducting properties under conditions that traditionally disrupt this state. His work involves synthesizing new materials with potential novel electronic properties and improving known materials, including ultrathin films and exotic superconductors. In collaboration with researchers from Tsinghua University and the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research, Falson discovered a superconducting material that defied traditional theoretical expectations by retaining superconductivity even in strong magnetic fields.\nThis breakthrough study revolved around a material composed of layered crystals, including bismuth telluride and lead telluride, topped with a thin layer of gray tin, which at minimal thickness behaves two-dimensionally, confining electron movement to a plane. The research revealed that the material's superconductivity was unusually resilient to magnetic fields, a finding that challenges conventional theories and suggests a structural property of the layered material that prevents easy alignment of electron spins with an applied magnetic field.\nFalson's laboratory recently has pushed to explore the quantum properties of electrons, particularly their spin in superconducting materials, and how these properties interact with the material's electronic structure. He aims to advance the fundamental understanding of superconductivity but also contribute to the quest for materials capable of superconducting at room temperature, which could have profound implications for energy transmission and electronic devices.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nFalson, J., Xu, Y., Liao, M., Zang, Y., Zhu, K., Wang, C., Zhang, Z., Liu, H., Duan, W., He, K. and Liu, H., 2020.

The structure which would be dubbed the Ramon Cojuangco Building would be inaugurated in 1982.\nThe building was the site of the setting up of a router that connected the Philippines to the internet in 1994 by Filipino engineer Benjie Tan.\nAs per the National Cultural Heritage Act which became law in 2009, the Ramon Cojuangco Building became a presumed Important Cultural Property (ICP) since it is a work of a National Artist.\nIn May 2022, the PLDT would file a petition to the National Commission for Culture and the Arts have the building delisted as an ICP intending to redevelop it into a \"modern, ecologically sustainable and open campus-type headquarters\".\n\n\n== Architecture and design ==\nThe Ramon Cojuangco Building is a 15-story structure designed by National Artist Leandro Locsin and is an example of International style architecture. It has also three levels underground. An NCCA report notes that Locsin's \"response to vernacular design\" is evident in the building but is \"minimal and ambigious\". The building is noted to exhibit's Locsin's \"floating effect\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Slavomir (Latin: Sclaomir, died 821 in Saxony) was a legendary tribal prince of the Obotrites from 809/810 to 819. In 817, he allied with the Danes and opposed the Franks. In 819, he was dethroned and exiled, but reinstated shortly before his death in 821.\n\n\n== In alliance with the Franks (809–817) ==\nHe assumed power over the Obotrites after the murder of King Thrasco by the Danes. At that time, the emperor exercised supreme authority over this group of Slavs. In 809 or 810, Charlemagne appointed him as the king of the Obodrites. In 811, he attempted, with the help of the Franks and Saxons, to restore his authority over the tribes of the Linones and the Bethenici, who had soon after Thrasco's death thrown off their dependence on the Obodrites. Four years later, in 815, he assisted Emperor Louis the Pious during the Frankish intervention in Denmark. The Saxon-Obotrite army, under the command of Missus Baldric of Friuli, was tasked with restoring Harald Klak to the throne. However, this expedition was unsuccessful, and after ravaging central Denmark, its participants withdrew to Saxony.\n\n\n== In alliance with Denmark (817–821) ==\nIn 817, Louis the Pious demanded that Slavomir share power over the Obodrites with Cedragus, the son of Thrasco. It is possible that the emperor aimed to weaken the Obodrite authority through this division. It is also possible that he complied with the requests of Cedragus himself and the nobles supporting him. Louis may have become acquainted with the position of the latter when, in July 815, an Obodrite embassy was present at the imperial court. Slavomir even swore that he would never again cross the Elbe. Open opposition of the Obodrites against Frankish influence occurred in 817. Refusing to submit to the emperor's orders, Slavomir simultaneously sent an embassy to the sons of the Danish king Gudfred, with whom he formed a military alliance. A joint attack plan on imperial territories was also agreed upon. The Danes and Obodrites were to divide the conquered lands inhabited by the Nordalbingians. Gudfred's sons sent a fleet up the Elbe, while the land forces of both the Obodrites and Danes plundered the bordering provinces. However, the military actions were limited to the unsuccessful siege of the border fortress of Itzehoe by the Danish-Obodrite forces.\nIn 819, Louis sent a punitive Saxon-Frankish expedition across the Elbe against Slavomir, commanded by his legates. The ruler of the Obodrites suffered defeat and was brought by imperial troops to Aachen. There, not only the Franks but also the influential Obodrite nobles opposed him, accusing him of unspecified \"numerous crimes\". Slavomir was exiled, and the Obodrite throne was handed over to Cedragus by the emperor.\nSlavomir remained in exile until 821. In that year, due to loss of trust in Cedragus, Louis the Pious again designated the exile as the prince of the Obodrites and allowed him to return. However, during the journey, he fell seriously ill and, having previously received baptism, died in Saxony.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBarkowski, Robert F.

Charles Angiro Gutumoi, who served as the Erute North Member of Parliament in the tenth Parliament of Uganda, died in an accident with three others in Murchison Game Park in 2023. This happened when he was travelling from Lira to Nebbi district to attend a traditional marriage ceremony. In May 2018, he was also involved in a serious accident near Karuma that left him with a broken leg.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nIn 2023, she was alleged for inciting locals to reject the opening of community access roads by Gulsan Construction Company which is constructing the Apac to Lira to Puranga road as part of their corporate social responsibility. She talked about the increased rate of accidents in Kampala because people drive when stressed and tired.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of members of the eleventh Parliament of Uganda\n\n\n== External links ==\nWebsite of the Parliament of Uganda\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Shep\" is the name given to a large sculpture of a semipalmated sandpiper located in Dorchester (now part of Tantramar), New Brunswick, Canada. The sculpture's name derives from the nearby Shepody Bay. Initially a wooden sculpture made by Monty MacMillan, Shep first stood at Dorchester since 2001 until being removed in 2020. The sculpture's rotting wood prevented repairs and a new one was made by Robin Hanson using steel, fibreglass and epoxy, and was installed on April 8, 2023.\n\n\n== Description ==\nShep is a large sculpture located in Dorchester, New Brunswick, which is now part of Tantramar. It depicts a semipalmated sandpiper and is made of steel, fibreglass and epoxy. It stands at 2.4 metres (7.9 ft) tall and weighs around 135 kilograms (298 lb). The sculpture by Robin Hanson was installed on April 8, 2023 as a replacement to a previous wooden version made by Monty MacMillan, which was removed in 2020. The sculpture's name \"Shep\" derives from the nearby Shepody Bay, an extension of the Bay of Fundy which many semipalmated sandpipers migrate to during the summer. It is considered by locals to be an important symbol of the community.\n\n\n== History ==\nShep's original wooden sculpture, made by Monty MacMillan, had originally stood in Dorchester since 2001, until being removed in 2020 to undergo repairs. The Dorchester village council approved funding for making repairs to the wooden sculpture and building a viewing platform for it. In 2021, repairs were unable to be made after MacMillan discovered that the sculpture's wood had started rotting, and his tools getting stolen prevented him from being able to rebuild it. In order to replace the sculpture, the village council commissioned one made with steel, epoxy and fibreglass from Robin Hanson. The new sculpture was built at a cost of $9,300.On January 1, 2023, as a result of the 2023 New Brunswick local governance reform, Dorchester was amalgamated with Sackville into the newly-formed town of Tantramar. Paying Hanson for the sculpture became less prioritized by the new town council, resulting in individuals and organizations attempting to raise funds towards covering costs themselves. On April 8, 2023, the new sculpture was transported to Dorchester and reinstalled by local volunteers rather than by municipal officials, which was well-received by residents. This resulted in controversy within the new council, with former Dorchester council member Debbie Wiggins-Colwell supporting Shep's return, while other officials, such as Tantramar mayor Andrew Black considering the statue to be an insurance and liability risk for the municipality. After considerations were made that Wiggins-Colwell had violated municipal codes of conduct, a third-party investigation was conducted by Montana Consulting in October 2023, costing the municipality $19,167.11. The investigation report concluded that Wiggins-Colwell made violations towards municipal codes of conduct, such as the \"failure to respect the decision-making process and follow policies, procedures and bylaws.\" Kara Becker, a former deputy mayor of Dorchester, opposed the Tantramar officials' disapproval with Wiggins-Colwell, calling what they had done a \"witch hunt\" and calling the investigation an \"embarrassment for the municipality.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe World's Largest Lobster, another animal sculpture in New Brunswick\n\n\n== References ==",

He entered the navy in January 1793, on board the Crescent frigate with Captain James Saumarez, whom he followed to the Orion, in which he was present in Lord Bridport's action off Lorient, at the battle of Cape St. Vincent, and at the battle of the Nile; after which he was promoted by Nelson to be acting-lieutenant of the Aquilon, a promotion which was confirmed by the admiralty to 17 April 1799. He subsequently served in the Channel and on the French coast, and at the reduction of the Cape of Good Hope, whence he was sent home by Sir Home Popham in command of an armed transport. He was flag-lieutenant to Sir James Saumarez in the Diomede, Hibernia, and Victory, and on 17 September 1808 was promoted to the command of the Rose sloop, in which he took part in the capture of Anholt in the Baltic, 18 May 1809, and was at different times engaged with the Danish gunboats. In 1812 he was presented by the emperor of Russia with a diamond ring, in acknowledgment of his having piloted a Russian squadron through the Belt; and by the king of Sweden with the order of the Sword, 'in testimony of the esteem in which he held his services. In 1813 Mansell commanded the Pelican on the north coast of Spain, and on 7 June 1814 was advanced to post rank. It is stated that while in command of the Rose and Pelican he captured at least 170 of the enemy's vessels, some of them privateers of force. In 1837 he was nominated a K.C.H. and knighted. On 9 October 1849 he became a rear-admiral on the retired list, and died in the early summer of 1858. In 1806 he married Catherine, daughter of John Lukis, a merchant of Guernsey, and by her had issue four daughters and four sons. These latter all entered the navy or marines. The second, Arthur Lukis, for some years commanded the Firefly, surveying ship, in the Mediterranean, and died, a retired vice-admiral, in 1890.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1893). \"Mansell, Thomas\".

        "content": "Isabel Cristina Fernandes Rodrigues Ferreira (born 1974) is a Portuguese scientist specialising in the agri-food sector, and a politician. Between 2019 and 2022 she was Secretary of State for Upgrading the Interior and between 2022 and 2024, she was Secretary of State for Regional Development. In the March 2024 national election she was elected to the Portuguese Assembly of the Republic to represent the Bragança District.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nFerreira was born on 2 January 1974, in Nampula in Portuguese Mozambique.  Her family moved to Bragança in Portugal when she was eleven months old. She obtained a degree in biochemistry from the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Porto and a master's degree and PhD in chemistry from the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Minho.\n\n\n== Academic career ==\nFerreira is a principal coordinating professor at the Polytechnic Institute of Bragança. She has also served as vice-president of the institute and as director of the Mountain Research Centre of the institute and a mentor at the Mountains Research Collaborative Laboratory (MORE). Her extensive research has led to the publication of 60 book chapters and more than 600 scientific articles. She also has several patents to her name, mainly resulting from technology transfer to industry. \nFerreira has been president of the Scientific Council of Natural and Environmental Sciences of the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT). She has been editor-in-chief of the natural and artificial antioxidants section of Antioxidants, associate editor of Food & Function, a journal of the Royal Society of Chemistry, and has been on the editorial board of Food and Chemical Toxicology, among others.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nIn 2019, Ferreira was appointed as Secretary of State for Upgrading the Interior within the newly created Ministry of Territorial Cohesion, as an independent in the government formed by the Socialist Party (PS) under prime minister António Costa. After the 2022 election the name was changed to Secretary of State for Regional Development. The main headquarters of her department was decentralized and located in Bragança, as an indication of the commitment of the Portuguese government to try to overcome depopulation in mountainous and other rural areas. In working to achieve this she collaborated closely with neighbouring areas in Spain that face similar problems. \nFollowing the defeat of the PS in the 2024 election, Ferreira ceased to be a secretary of state. However, she had been nominated at the top of the list of PS candidates for the Bragança District constituency and was elected to the national assembly, as the only PS representative in the three-seat constituency.    \n\n\n== Awards and honours ==\nAwards received by Ferreira have included: \n\n2019 – Winner of the European Social Innovation Award\n2017 – Awarded with the Medal of Merit from the Municipality of Bragança.\n2016 – Distinguished by the National Agency for Scientific and Technological Culture, in the book Mulheres na Ciência (Women in Science).\n2014 – Winner of the Horticultural Operational and Technological Centre (COTHN) award for R&D and Innovation\n2001 – Winner of the Gulbenkian Prize for Stimulating Scientific Research\n\n\n== References ==",

The construction of the line is expected to provide a fast and direct transit between George Town's city centre towards the airport.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Penang International Airport is the primary airport serving Penang, and among the busiest airports in Malaysia.\nIn 2015, the station was identified as the southern terminus of a 17.5 kilometres (10.9 mi) light rail transit line between the Penang International Airport and Komtar. However, subsequent redesigns extended the line to 26–29 kilometres (16–18 mi) with the southern terminus ending at reclaimed land south of the airport.\nIn 2019, for approval of the light rail transit line by the Land Public Transport Agency, the statutory body concerning public transport in Malaysia, the Penang state government was required to discuss with Malaysia Airports regarding the alignment and proximity of the station from the Penang International Airport.\n\n\n== Layout ==\n\n\n=== Rail services ===\nThe Penang Airport station is proposed to be served by the following rail lines:\n\n\n=== Connection ===\nThe Penang Airport station is proposed to be connected to the following stations:\n\n Rapid Penang public bus station: 102, 306, 401, 401E\n\n\n== See also ==\nTanjong Tokong line\nAyer Itam line\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Telesforo Chuidian (January 5, 1855 – 1903) was a Filipino businessman known for providing financial support for the propaganda movement and the Philippine Revolution against Spain.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nChuidian was born in Binondo, Manila, in 1855. His parents were Silveria Chuaquico and Jose Antonio Chuy Dian, a merchant who came from Xiamen, China. He inherited the family business upon his father's death, which resulted for him to quit his studies at the Ateneo de Manila University.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Businessman ===\nChuidian established Sociedad Chuidian, Buenaventura, y Cía, a business engaged in the import of Arabian horses, perfumes, and other merchandise. His business also provided cash loans for coffee and sugar plantations in Batangas. From his business, Chuidian was able to acquire several haciendas and properties in Manila.\n\n\n=== Revolution supporter ===\nChuidian was one of people who financed the La Liga Filipina, a political group founded in 1892 by Jose Rizal. He, with 22 others, was arrested and imprisoned in 1896 in Fort Santiago for their participation in anti-Spanish movements.\nAfter the independence of the Philippines from Spain in 1898, Chuidian, together with others, founded the Club Filipino Independiente. He became the club's first leader.\n\nMoreover, Chuidian became a member of the Malolos Congress. Under Emilio Aguinaldo, the Philippine government issued its own paper currency with Chuidian, Pedro Paterno, and Mariano Limjap as signatories. However, the paper notes were later withdrawn from circulation with the surrender of Filipino revolutionists and the occupation of the Americans in the country.\n\n\n== Death ==\nChuidian contracted tuberculosis of the larynx and died in 1903 at age 48.\n\n\n== Recognitions ==\nOrder of Isabella the Catholic\nKapitan Tiago, a fictional character in Noli Me Tangere, a novel written by Jose Rizal, was inspired by Chuidian\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hamas war crimes are the violations of international criminal law, including war crimes and crimes against humanity, which the Islamist Nationalist organization Hamas and its paramilitary wing, the al-Qassam Brigades have been accused of committing. These have included murder, intentional targeting of civilians, killing prisoners of war and surrendered combatants, indiscriminate attacks, the use of human shields, rape, torture and pillage.\n\n\n== Applicability of laws of war ==\nDetermining the applicability of laws of war to militant groups is a difficult question, as both the Council of Europe and International Committee of the Red Cross note that international law traditionally treats war and terrorism as separate legal categories. The Israeli, American, EU, UK, Japanese, and Canadian governments define Hamas as a terrorist group. However, many countries have disagreed with this characterization and have engaged with Hamas as a legitimate political entity. While the term \"international law\" conventionally pertains to states, it has also been applied to insurgent and terrorist armed forces.  Accordingly, even insurgencies deemed lawful under international law that meet the criteria of \"just cause\" must also adhere to  principles of \"just means\" as well. Regarding Hamas and its combatants, even if they have a presumptive right to fight against what they term as an \"illegal occupation,\" they must still abide by legal rules of \"discrimination\", \"proportionality\", and \"military necessity\" under international law as conventional states do.\nAccording to Human Rights Watch, \"international humanitarian law, through the well-established doctrine of command responsibility\" also applies \"to political and other leaders insofar as they have 'effective responsibility and control' over the actors in question...thus making its leadership also criminally liable.\"\n\n\n== War Crimes ==\n\n\n=== Targeting of Civilians ===\nAccording to Amnesty International, the \"prohibition on targeting civilians is absolute in international law\". \nHuman Rights Watch has declared that the \"scale and systematic nature\" of Hamas'  targeting of Israeli civilians \"meet the definition of a crime against humanity\", and that its particular use of suicide bombings taking \"place in the context of violence that amounts to armed conflict...are also war crimes.\"\n\n\n=== Suicide Attacks ===\nAccording to Amnesty International, \"the campaign of suicide bombings and deliberate attacks against Israeli civilians by Hamas and other armed groups constitutes crimes against humanity.\nBetween September 1993 and the outbreak of the Second Intifada in September 2000, \"Palestinian groups carried out fourteen suicide bombing attacks against Israeli civilians, mostly in 1996-97, killing more than 120 and wounding over 550. Hamas said it committed most of the attacks.\"\nIn the decade between 2000 and 2010, there were 146 suicide attacks committed by Palestinian militant groups against Israelis, resulting in 516 fatalities. A 2007 Harvard University study of 135 Palestinian suicide attacks conducted between September 2000 and August 2005 determined Hamas responsible for 39.9% of such attacks during that period.\n\n\n=== Use of Human Shields ===\n\nIsrael has accused Hamas of using human shields in the Gaza Strip, saying that Hamas has purposely attempted to shield itself from Israeli attacks by storing weapons in civilian infrastructure, launching rockets from residential areas, and telling residents to ignore Israeli warnings to flee. Israel has also accused Hamas of maintaining command and control bunkers and tunnel infrastructure below hospitals. Hamas has denied using hospitals to shield any command centre, while it has previously made remarks expressing support for Palestinians refusing to flee areas Israel has targeted.\nThe Israeli accusations have been supported by NATO, and during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war EU nations condemned Hamas for using hospitals as human shields, while the UN Secretary General said \"Hamas and other militants use civilians as human shields\". In 2023, HRW stated \"Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups need to take all feasible precautions to protect civilians under their control from the effects of attacks and not use civilians as 'human shields.'\"\n\n\n=== Indiscriminate Attacks ===\n\nBetween 2000 and 2021, over 17,000 rockets were fired into Israel from Gaza. Hamas' use of indiscriminate rocket attacks on civilians has been widely condemned as a war crime. Palestinian UN Observer Ibrahim Kraishi has equally decried the attacks, stating that \"every rocket and mortar fired from Gaza toward Israel is a “crime against humanity.”\n\n\n== Second Intifada ==\n\nDuring the Second Intifada, the majority of Israeli casualties were civilian non-combatants, with Hamas conducting numerous attacks deliberately targeting civilians. \nProminent examples include:\n\n\n== 2014 Gaza war ==\n\n\n=== Killing and shooting of Gazan civilians ===\n\nTwenty civilians from Shuja'iyya were killed while protesting against Hamas. A few days later, Hamas reportedly killed two Gazans and wounded ten after a scuffle broke out over food handouts.\nThe IDF stated on 31 July that more than 280 Hamas rockets malfunctioned and fell inside the Gaza strip, hitting sites including Al-Shifa Hospital and the Al-Shati refugee camp, killing at least 11 and wounding dozens. Hamas denied that any of its rockets hit the Gaza Strip., but Palestinian sources said numerous rocket launches ended up falling in Gaza communities and that scores of people have been killed or injured. Israeli Military sources said the failed Hamas launches increased amid heavy Israeli air and artillery strikes throughout the Gaza Strip. They said the failed launches reflected poorly assembled rockets as well as the rush to load and fire projectiles before they were spotted by Israeli aircraft. While the Al-Shifa Hospital incident is disputed, early news reports have suggested that the strike was from an Israeli drone missile. Amnesty International concluded that the explosion at the Shati refugee camp on 28 July in which 13 civilians were killed was caused by a Palestinian rocket, despite Palestinian claims it was an Israeli missile.\n\n\n=== Killing of suspected collaborators ===\n\nShurat HaDin filed a suit with the ICC charging Khaled Mashaal with war crimes for the executions of 38 civilians. Hamas co-founder Ayman Taha was found dead; Al-Quds Al-Arabi reported he had been shot by Hamas for maintaining contact with the intelligence services of several Arab countries; Hamas stated he was targeted by an Israeli airstrike.\nOn 26 May 2015, Amnesty International released a report saying that Hamas carried out extrajudicial killings, abductions and arrests of Palestinians and used the Al-Shifa Hospital to detain, interrogate and torture suspects. It details the executions of at least 23 Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israel and torture of dozens of others, many victims of torture were members of the rival Palestinian movement, Fatah.\n\n\n== 2023 Israel–Hamas war ==\n\nOn 9 October 2023 Human Rights Watch stated that Hamas's apparent targeting of civilians, indiscriminate attacks, and taking of hostages amounted to war crimes.\nOn 10 October 2023 the OHCHR stated the taking of hostages and use of human shields were war crimes. United Nations Human Rights chief Volker Türk noted that militant groups' \"horrifying mass killings\" were violations of international law.\n\n\n=== Re'im music festival massacre ===\n\nAs one of the first massacres of many in the coordinated attacks on 7 October 2023, militants of the al-Qassam Brigades and other Palestinian factions entered a music festival in Re'im at c. 7 a.m. local time and murdered over 360 people, as well as taking over 40 people hostage. Considering the attack on festival goers as indiscriminate in nature, along with a lack of Israeli military presence during the massacre, it could only be considered an intentional attack against civilians.\n\n\n=== Be'eri massacre ===\n\nAt c. 7:10 a.m., on 7 October 2023, around 70 al-Qassam and DFLP militants had entered and attacked the kibbutz of Be'eri, taking over 130 peoples' lives, including women (such as peace activist Vivian Silver), children, toddlers, and one infant, in total claiming the lives of 10% of the farming community's residents. Dozens of homes were also burned down.\n\n\n== See also ==\nChildren in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict\nHuman rights in the State of Palestine\nCapital punishment in the Gaza Strip\nCriticism of Hamas\nIsraeli war crimes\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Die Tat was a social liberal Swiss newspaper published by Migros from 1935 to 1978, first as a weekly, then as an evening daily and finally as a morning tabloid. It was launched by the founder of Migros, Gottlieb Duttweiler. While the weekly newspaper was the party organ of the Alliance of Independents, the evening paper quickly emancipated from it and also gained a high reputation outside Switzerland, in particular thanks to its weekend supplement Die literarische Tat under the direction of Max Rychner and Erwin Jaeckle and the collaboration of numerous well-known journalists. The decline of the political press in the 1970s, combined with a lack of advertising revenue due to its proximity to Migros, led to the closure of the evening newspaper at the end of March 1977. The then president of Migros, Pierre Arnold, tried to continue the title as a tabloid. However, after 16 months, the paper's harsh style, which was critical of the economy, forced him to dismiss editor-in-chief Roger Schawinski. Without consulting the editorial team, he appointed Karl Vögeli in his place, who was supposed to guarantee a more moderate direction for the paper. The following protest strike by the editorial team led to the closure of the tabloid at the end of September 1978, just one and a half years after its launch.\nThe Swiss National Library has fully digitized Die Tat and made it available online in 2016.\n\n\n== The weekly newspaper ==\n\nFor the first four years of its existence, Die Tat was a weekly newspaper. The first number appeared on November 12, 1935, with the subtitle \"Wochenpost der sieben Unabhängigen\" (\"Weekly mail of the seven independents\"). It referred to the seven members of the \"Association of Independents\" who had won a seat on the National Council in 1935: Franklin Bircher, Gottlieb Duttweiler, Ulrich Eggenberger, Heinrich Schnyder, Willy Stäubli, Fritz Wüthrich and Balthasar Zimmermann.\n\nDuttweiler wrote that they wanted to produce \"a simple, serious weekly 'accountability report' from the 7 independents for their friends\". No advertisements were taken out so as not to compete with the press and to remain independent (there were only a few advertisements from the travel agency Hotel-Plan, which was founded in the same year and belonged to Migros; still written as such at the time). Die Tat wanted to \"report objectively while avoiding controversy\" and also \"let opponents have their say briefly.\" He also stated as a motive for founding the newspaper the resistance to National Socialism in Switzerland, which Die Tat opposed without compromise from the very beginning.\"It was the frontline spring of 1935, and the aim was to counter the clamor of the Swiss Nazi disciples with something juicy.\"\n- Gottlieb Duttweiler: Die Tat, October 2, 1959The editor in-chief was initially Hermann Walder, the lawyer for Migros, followed by Eugen Theodor Rimli from November 19, 1937, and Willy Aerni, the managing director of the Alliance of Independents (LdU) founded at the end of 1936, from April 28, 1939. Walder moved to the editorial board of Die Tat, where he remained until the separation from Duttweiler in October 1943, and Rimli continued to write articles for the newspaper after his resignation as editor in-chief (in 1940/1941 he was editor-in-chief of the short-lived first tabloid newspaper in Switzerland, Actualis, after which he founded Fraumünster Publishing House Zurich, later renamed Stauffacher-Publishing House, and published Illustrierte Weltgeschichte and Illustrierte Welt-Kunstgeschichte). After the evening paper was founded, Aerni was head of the administration and advertising department until the end of May 1948.\n\nDie Tat was printed in the old Züricher Post printing works on the premises of the old university on St.-Peter-Strasse in the center of Zurich. At the beginning of 1937, after the founding of the LdU, the newspaper was given a larger format and a size of 6 to 8 pages instead of 4, exceptionally also 12 and 16 pages, changed its title from \"Die\" to \"Schlengge\" and its subtitle to \"Wochenpost des Landesrings der Unabhängigen\". From then on, it was published on Fridays instead of Wednesdays (only the first issue was published on a Tuesday). From this point on, it also took advertisements.\nFollowing Migros' decision to publish a daily newspaper, the last issue of the weekly Tat was published in its previous form on September 29, 1939. Until the publication of Brückenbauer (today's Migros-Magazin) on September 25, 1942, Migros continued to publish Tat (Wochenpost) with a different editorial mission.\n\n\n== The evening newspaper ==\nOn September 8, 1939, Die Tat announced the conversion of the weekly newspaper into a daily newspaper on October 1. Duttweiler initially wanted to\n\ncall it Der Tag, with the previous weekly paper appearing as a Friday edition. However, as a result of this and the change of title, the Federal Council stated that it was a newly founded newspaper, which was forbidden according to a Federal Council resolution of September 8, 1939. Duttweiler then decided to keep the name Die Tat and not to publish the Friday edition as a continuation of the weekly paper. The Federal Council then approved the daily newspaper, which first appeared on October 2, 1939 (available the evening before), now with the subtitle \"Schweizerische unabhängige Tageszeitung\" (Swiss independent daily newspaper), six times a week in the evening, always with the date of the next day. Until November 7, 1939, Tuesday was the publication-free day, then Sunday.\nDuttweiler justified the need to expand Die Tat into a daily newspaper by pointing out that the rest of the Swiss daily press was closed to the LdU. However, only a daily newspaper could meet the new, larger tasks facing the LdU movement; a political movement without a daily newspaper was \"not viable in our country in the long term\". Even as a daily newspaper, Die Tat continued its strict rejection of National Socialism. It was banned in Germany and Hungary just two months after its launch, and a further two months later in Italy.\nThe editors in charge and, from 1943, editors-in-chief were Max Rychner (1939–1943), Erwin Jaeckle (from 1962 and until 1977 also head of Literarische Tat) (1943–1971) and Walter Biel (1971–1977).\nThe first editorial team consisted of Max Rychner (feuilleton, but de facto abroad until 1943 due to absences for military service, then feuilleton until 1962), Herbert von Moos (abroad, previously Schweizer Zeitung and Schweizerische Republikanische Blätter, also popular editor of the \"Völkerbundschronik\" at Radio Beromünster, from May 1937 \"Die Welt von Genf aus gesehen\", from 19. September 1939 called \"Weltchronik\", under pressure from the German legation and Federal Councillor Marcel Pilet-Golaz because of his emphatically anti-Nazi stance, but formally dismissed for \"negligence\" at Radio Beromünster and resigned in December 1940 \"for health reasons\"), Felix Moeschlin (president of the Swiss Writers' Association, domestic affairs, until 1942, then president of the editorial commission), Karl Gnädinger (writer, local affairs, pseudonym \"Nepomuk\", until his accidental death in 1943) and Charles La Roche (economist, economics, until 1940, then replaced by Hans Munz). Permanent contributors were Jean Rudolf von Salis (foreign commentary, until the split of the LdU in October 1943), Ernest Grosselin (colonel divisionary, military), Paul Gentizon (previously correspondent of the Temps and the Gazette de Lausanne), Bernhard Diebold (writer, theater critic, until 1945, previously Frankfurter Zeitung), Robert Oboussier (music critic, 1939 until his assassination in 1957, previously Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung) and Peter Meyer (editor of the architecture and art magazine Das Werk).\n\nAt the end of 1941, the Tat editorial office, administration and print shop moved into new premises on Limmatstrasse in the Migros-Genossenschafts-Bund (MGB), which was founded the same year. In 1943, the new editor-in-chief Erwin Jaeckle introduced various changes. He abolished the Bernese and Basel local sections and integrated them into the general section, which enabled him to appoint the Bernese editor as the editor for the Federal Parliament and the Basel editor as the foreign editor. This in turn allowed Max Rychner to return from the foreign section to his traditional feature section. Jaeckle also introduced a women's page, was the first Swiss newspaper to regularly publish excerpts from the world press and launched the first radio page in the Swiss press in 1944. A special feature of the Tat from the very beginning was the daily topical picture page with an average of eight pictures on the last page of the main paper. From July 31, 1943, the newspaper was published with a new typeface, the titles in Antiqua instead of sans-serif and with black negative bars as column headers in the political section. From March 12, 1944, Tat was also published on Sundays again and thus from then on seven times a week. In December 1952, the editorial and administrative offices moved to Limmatplatz, where the Migros headquarters are also located.\nThe outstanding figure of the evening newspaper Die Tat was Erwin Jaeckle, who was also politically active (1942–1950 in the Zurich municipal council, 1945 president, 1947–1962 in the National Council for the Alliance of Independents). Duttweiler had initially intended him to be editor-in-chief, but Jaeckle wanted to work on his habilitation and suggested Max Rychner instead, a colleague of his at the feuilleton Der Bund at the time. In the end, however, he chose a career in journalism instead of academia and joined the paper on January 1, 1943. He wanted to be hired as domestic editor and not as Rychner's superior out of respect for Max Rychner, who was 12 years his senior and had experience in the press, and he demanded that the editorial office not report directly to Duttweiler, but to a works commission that would act as an intermediary between the editorial office and Duttweiler. This is what happened. However, after he had made various suggestions for improvement, the works commission urged him to become the first nominal editor-in-chief after all, and Jaeckle agreed after some deliberation. Under his leadership, Die Tat gained a great reputation as a daily newspaper that extended beyond the borders of Switzerland, particularly through the weekend supplement Literarische Tat (until the end of 1960 \"Kunst - Literatur - Forschung\"), which was supervised by Max Rychner and later by Erwin Jaeckle himself.\nJust as Jaeckle had uncompromisingly opposed National Socialism, after the war he fought against the proscription of what he saw as alleged National Socialist sympathizers such as Hans Konrad Sonderegger, Gustav Däniker, Eugen Bircher and Robert F. Denzler or Grock as well as \"purges\" or expulsions of Germans such as Bernard von Brentano and insisted on strict adherence to the law. In 1945, the Zurich government council banned a concert by Wilhelm Furtwängler with the Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich for fear of disturbances, after the Labor Party in the municipal council had interpellated the city council as to whether it intended to allow the concert by the \"Prussian State Council\". Jaeckle also strongly criticized this.\nHis liberal attitude was also reflected in his rejection of the banning of communist and fascist parties during the Second World War. He was of the opinion that the Swiss did not need such protective measures because he considered their \"inherited legal concepts to be strong and firm.\" Accordingly, he also opposed the so-called Jesuit article, i.e. the ban on the Jesuit order and generally on the establishment or re-establishment of monasteries that had been included in the Swiss constitution since 1874 (The corresponding articles were removed from the constitution in a referendum in 1973). On the other hand, he was in favor of the death penalty for treason introduced in the Military Penal Code in 1940 (It was abolished in 1992).\nAs a member of the National Council, Jaeckle unsuccessfully campaigned for an unrestricted ban on the export of weapons. However, he was successful with his demand that Swiss soldiers be issued with sealed pocket ammunition for storage at home so that they would be ready to fight immediately in the event of war. In general, a strong army was an important concern for him, and he vehemently opposed the development of aircraft. In 1949, he achieved an increase in contributions to Pro Helvetia, which was founded in the same year as the Tat evening newspaper. In 1952, he initiated the abolition of further subsidies for Holzverzuckerungs AG, which later became Ems-Chemie, with a postulate that was initially rejected. The abolition of the subsidy was then approved in a referendum on May 13, 1956.\nJaeckle's relationship with the authoritarian, eruptive Gottlieb Duttweiler was not without conflict. The latter, who as an entrepreneur was more interested in economic issues and had never done military service, accused him of never making any advances on the country's major problems. Jaeckle, who was more interested in cultural issues and, as an officer, in military matters, was offended by this. Duttweiler also regularly threatened to close down the newspaper during these frequent disputes. He called Jaeckle the thread on which Die Tat was hanging.\nAfter leaving the National Council in 1962, Erwin Jaeckle rarely expressed his political views and, following the resignation of Max Rychner in the same year, devoted himself increasingly to the management of Literarische Tat, his literary passions and genealogical studies of his family. He retired at the end of May 1971, but remained in charge of Literarische Tat until the evening newspaper ceased publication in 1977. After that, he made no secret of his disdain for the new tabloid under the same name.\n\nIn 1972, the new editor-in-chief Walter Biel redesigned the Tat. The newspaper head became red, only the weekend edition remained the \"green Tat\". The front page now featured the most important events from all departments and an illustrated \" daily news\" instead of just foreign news as before. The layout was changed from four to five columns.\nDie Tat had a circulation of over 40,000 copies before and during the Second World War and around 35,000 copies afterwards, making it the third-largest political daily newspaper in German-speaking Switzerland. However, it was never profitable, partly because its proximity to Migros meant that it did not receive any brand advertisements. The decline of the political press in the 1970s also led to a reduction in circulation to only around 25,000 copies by 1976. The successors of Gottlieb Duttweiler (who died in 1962) at Migros, for whom the newspaper was \"too elitist\" and generated too little response, were ultimately no longer willing to bear the resulting increasing losses, although in 1974 they decided to continue publishing Die Tat for at least five years. Charles Linsmayer and Alfred A. Häsler asked the publisher in a petition signed by 153 personalities from the worlds of culture, science, politics and business, including Friedrich Traugott Wahlen, Hans-Peter Tschudi and Siegfried Unseld, to at least continue Literarische Tat in a suitable manner. On April 1, 1977, the last issue of Die Tat appeared in its previous form. Biel became Director of Economic Policy at the Migros-Genossenschafts-Bund.\n\n\n== The tabloid ==\n\nThe president of the Migros administrative delegation at the time, Pierre Arnold, wanted to replace the evening newspaper with an aggressive but factual \"tabloid newspaper of a high standard\" (without \"sex and crime\"). A few years earlier, however, a project with similar aspirations in the form of the Neue Presse had failed. Arnold was able to convince the 26-member board of his project by a very narrow margin of 12 to 11 members. The new newspaper was to focus on consumer protection, with the aim of achieving a circulation of 80,000 copies in one year and being financially self-supporting in three years.\nTo this end, Arnold recruited a largely new, much larger team under editor-in-chief Roger Schawinski, including Kurt W. Zimmermann, Urs P. Gasche, Peter Knechtli (Basel), Hanspeter Thür (advice), Fredy Hämmerli and Gerd Klinner, who had already been editor of the evening paper from 1969 to 1972. Ulrich Doerfel, deputy editor-in-chief and head of features and reports, Herbert Tauber, head of foreign affairs, and Albin Minder, head of local affairs, were transferred from the evening paper's masthead to that of the tabloid. Local editor Silvio Kippe was also planned, but he left before the new newspaper was published. In order to make the significantly higher circulation and four-color printing possible, it was necessary to set up a printing plant in Spreitenbach, Limmatdruck AG, in a very short space of time. The original plan was to publish the new Tat as early as the end of 1976, also as an evening newspaper, but Schawinski, who had been working for Migros since the beginning of 1977, successfully resisted this move.\nOn April 4, 1977, Tat appeared for the first time in a new layout, in half-format, and was the first national newspaper in Switzerland to be printed in four colors. As a morning newspaper published Monday to Saturday, it competed with Blick. According to its own figures, it had a circulation of 70,000 copies and a reach of over 200,000 readers. The newspaper subsequently became known, among other things, for uncovering the so-called Chiasso scandal at Schweizerische Kreditanstalt SKA (now Credit Suisse), which Tat called \"SKAndal\".\nHowever, the newspaper's aggressive style, sometimes also towards Migros, soon led to fierce criticism from a growing number of members of the administration, who also referred to numerous expressions of displeasure from cooperative members. In addition, the annual deficits of 8 to 12 million Swiss francs far exceeded the targets and a balanced account, as demanded by Arnold for a period that had now been extended to five years, no longer seemed achievable. Arnold finally demanded that Schawinski dismiss two or three activists from the works group of the left-wing SJU union, including Hanspeter Bürgin in particular, whom he considered to be mainly responsible for the newspaper's economically critical, sharp course. When Schawinski refused, Arnold dismissed him without notice on July 26, 1978. He gave the editorial team clear guidelines for their work, which were intended to bring about a change in the style of the newspaper, but not, in his opinion, an actual change of course. Bürgin then left the newspaper of his own accord.\nArnold appointed the previous deputy editor-in-chief Gerd Klinner as editor-in-chief. Klinner initially accepted the position, but then rejected it after consulting with the editorial team, who demanded that Schawinski be reinstated as editor-in-chief. Pierre Arnold refused and asked the editorial team to appoint two other editors alongside Klinner to form an interim three-man editorial team. The editorial team chose Urs P. Gasche and Karl Biffiger. At the same time, however, it demanded an editorial statute that would guarantee the continuation of the previous direction. However, it was not possible to agree on an editorial statute in which Migros wanted to include its \"guidelines\" in subsequent discussions.\nOn September 19, 1978, Arnold appointed Karl Vögeli, the editor-in-chief of Blick, as the new editor-in-chief without consulting the editorial team, with the task of enforcing Migros' guidelines in the editorial office. The latter reacted on 22 September 1978 \"in complete misjudgement of its position of power\" (Schawinski) with a strike in which all 56 editorial employees organized in the SJU took part and protested against Vögeli's appointment, which had been made without consulting them. The editorial statutes of the Tat stipulated that the editorial staff should be consulted \"before all important questions\", although Migros had not signed them (although in the opinion of the editorial staff they had \"verbally approved\" them) and Arnold therefore did not feel bound by them. Arnold had also given verbal and written assurances that he would recognize the 1972 collective agreement (previously the \"Baden Agreement\", now the collective employment agreement) between the Association of Journalists and the Newspaper Publishers' Association, which also stipulated the obligation to consult the editorial team before making important decisions. However, as a non-association member, Migros was not bound by the collective agreement either. Five editors who were not organized in the SJU (including Klinner and Gasche from the transitional editorial team, who had resigned in the meantime) protested against the strike and accused the strikers of endangering jobs, including technical ones.\nThis meant that on Saturday, September 23, 1978, for the first time in Swiss press history, a newspaper was not published due to a strike by the editorial staff. Migros gave the editorial staff a written ultimatum to resume work by Friday evening, which was later extended to Saturday noon. If the request was not complied with, the letter would be regarded as termination without notice. The editorial team let the ultimatum expire unused. Migros then immediately confirmed the immediate dismissal of the approximately 40 striking editors, who were not prepared to resume work, and locked them out by changing the door locks. The editors subsequently published seven issues of a strike newspaper, Die Wut, in the cooperative print shop for around a month with the same layout as the strike and a circulation of 80,000 to 100,000 copies. On Monday, September 25, 1978, Migros carried out its threat and ceased publication of the newspaper. Vögeli became head of the New Media department at the Migros-Genossenschafts-Bund.\nIn an \"open letter to Swiss newspaper readers\" published in the Neue Zürcher Zeitung on September 27, 1978, among others, Arnold justified Migros' actions. The appointment of an editor-in-chief was the sole responsibility of the publisher. If the editorial team had the right of co-determination, no serious applicant would apply because they would run the risk of losing their current job if their application became known through indiscretions. Such indiscretions had indeed occurred in previous cases.\nThe striking editors initially continued with the publication of Die Wut and a variety of actions. On October 19, 1978, Migros reached an agreement with the VPOD trade union, to which SJU belonged as one of its sections, to pay the wages of the editors who had been dismissed without notice until the end of the year and to waive claims for damages. For its part, the VPOD agreed to withdraw the initiated judicial assessment of the justification of the dismissals without notice and to discontinue the strike newspaper Die Wut, in which Arnold's address and telephone number had been published.\n\n\n== Editors and editorial staff ==\n\n\n=== Editors in charge of the weekly newspaper ===\nHermann Walder: 1935-1937 (Migros lawyer)\nEugen Theodor Rimli: 1937-1939 (previously Germany correspondent for various Swiss newspapers, including Weltwoche)\nWilly Aerni: 1939 (managing director of the LdU)\n\n\n=== Evening newspaper ===\n\n\n==== Editors in charge and editors-in-chief ====\nMax Rychner: 1939-1943 (until 1962 head of the supplement \"Kunst - Literatur - Forschung\", renamed Die literarische Tat in 1960, previously editor of the Neue Schweizer Rundschau, the Kölnische Zeitung and Der Bund)\nErwin Jaeckle: 1943-1971 (previously deputy publishing director of Atlantis Verlag and employee of Max Rychner at Der Bund, first formal \"editor-in-chief\", from 1962 and until 1977 also director of Literarische Tat)\nWalter Biel: 1971-1977 (previously business editor of Die Tat since 1959)\n\n\n==== Other well-known editors ====\nFritz René Allemann (abroad, 1942-1946 London correspondent, 1946-1947 Paris correspondent, 1947-1949 head of foreign affairs, 1949-1960 Bonn correspondent, 1960-1967 Berlin correspondent, then freelancer)\nRoman Brodmann (film editor, 1943–1949)\nHans Fleig (London correspondent from 1948, 1951-1961 head of foreign affairs)\nAlfred Grütter (Federal City Editor, 1942 until his death in 1964),\nHans Munz (economics, 1941–1944)\n\n\n==== Other well-known editors and editorial staff ====\nErich Brock (literary critic), Elisabeth Brock-Sulzer (theater critic, 1945–1977), Karl Heinrich David (concert and opera critic, 1944–1951), the later Zurich government councillor Alfred Gilgen (medical special page), Henry \"Heiri\" Gysler (local news), Fritz Güttinger (literary critic), Alfred A.

The book was centered on Africa's culture, religion, history, imagination, and identity, examining how its past intertwines with that of others. He emphasizes Africa's intrinsic values, including its humanity, self-worth, and methods of environmental stewardship, encompassing both physical and intangible aspects. Despite acknowledging Africa's daunting challenges, Soyinka rejects defeatism, eloquently analyzing issues from historical significance to the rise of theocracy. He fearlessly confronts complex topics like racial biases, inter-ethnic conflicts, and the impact of colonial-imposed borders on nationhood. Soyinka's profound examination reimagines Africa's place in the reader's mind, charting a path toward a future defined by peace and self-empowerment.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe novel centres on a profound exploration of Africa's unique qualities and challenges, as pointed out by Wole Soyinka.

Amidst discussions of Africa's negative attributes and external perceptions, Soyinka underscores the interconnectedness of Africa's past and present with the rest of the world. The narrative reflects on various encounters and perspectives on Africa, ranging from admiration to disdain, showcasing the diverse reactions and attitudes towards the continent. Through personal encounters and reflections, the plot navigates the complexities of African identity and challenges prevailing stereotypes.\n\n\n== Language choice ==\nThe language choice used in this book  could be described as academic, reflective, and informative, and there is also the use of flashbacks on African religion, culture, and rites.

        "content": "Sarmat Ikoev is an Ossetian politician from the partially recognized Caucasian Republic of South Ossetia, which most of the United Nations recognizes as part of Georgia, occupied by Russia.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPrior to his election to Parliament, Ikoev would serve in several minor roles in Anatoly Bibilov's camp, namely serving on his campaign during the 2011 South Ossetian presidential election, where he was the election observer for the village of Ruk. Where, during the election, 300 citizens of North Ossetia attempted to vote, mostly in favor of Bibilov, compared to the village's population of just 178 of which only 65 claimed to have voted.\nIkoev would be elected to the Parliament of South Ossetia during the 2019 election, as an independent, however, affiliated himself with Bibilov, stating he would follow United Ossetia's \"course\" and \"support\" the party, while not officially joining. Ikoev stated that he ran as an independent to promote bi-partisanship and that he would support \"any party\" and \"any faction\" if it was in the best interest of the South Ossetian people and his constituents.\nFollowing the sacking of Uruzmag Dzhagayev as Prosecutor General of South Ossetia due to his role in the Murder of Inal Djabiev, Bibilov chose Sochi based Vitaly Savchenko as his replacement. However, in a rare instance of opposition, Parliament rejected Savchenko's nomination to the post due to his lack of South Ossetian citizenship. Ikoev, alongside vice-speaker Peter Gasssiev, dramatically walked out of parliament and abstained, which allowed the rejection vote to narrowly pass.\nIn December 2022 Ikoev was on the committee which implemented the integration of South Ossetia's tariffs to be in accordance with the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), despite not officially being a member of the EEU, by implementing it's tariff rates the South Ossetian government hopes to open up trade to other countries, and reduce it's dependence on Russia, which accounts for 95% of all imports into South Ossetia.\nIn November 2023, Ikoev, alongside Zaza Driaev, went on a state visit to North Ossetia to meet with their parliament over implementing matching laws on \"Physical Culture and Sports\" in both North and South Ossetia.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sir Joseph Nias  (2 April 1793 – 17 December 1879) was a British Royal Navy admiral.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nNias was third son of Joseph Nias, ship insurance broker. He was born in London on 2 April 1793. He entered the navy in 1807, on board the Nautilus sloop, under the command of Captain Matthew Smith, with whom he continued in the Comus and Nymphen frigates, on the Lisbon, Mediterranean, North Sea, and Channel stations till August 1815. During the last few weeks of the Nymphen's commission Nias, in command of one of her boats, was employed in rowing guard round the Bellerophon in Plymouth Sound, keeping off the sightseers who thronged to catch a glimpse of Napoleon. He continued in active service after the peace, and in January 1818 was appointed to the Alexander brig, with Lieutenant William Edward Parry, for an expedition to the Arctic under the command of Sir John Ross. In February 1819 he was again with Parry in the Hecla, returning to the Thames in November 1820, and on 26 December he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant. In January 1821 he was again appointed to the Hecla with Parry, and sailed for the Arctic in May. After two winters in the ice the Hecla returned to England in November 1823. In 1826 Nias went out to the Mediterranean as first lieutenant of the Asia, carrying the flag of Sir Edward Codrington, and, after the battle of Navarino, was promoted to be commander on 11 November 1827, and appointed to the Alacrity brig, in which he saw some sharp service against the Greek pirates who at that time infested the Archipelago, and especially on 11 January 1829, in cutting out one commanded by a noted ruffian named Georgios, who was sent to Malta and duly hanged. The Alacrity was paid off in 1830.\nNias was advanced to post rank on 8 July 1835, and in May 1838 commissioned the Herald frigate for the East Indies, a station which at that time included Australia, China, and the Western Pacific. In February 1840, when Captain William Hobson of the navy was ordered to take possession of New Zealand in the name of the queen, he went from Sydney as a passenger in the Herald, and was assisted by Nias in the formal proceedings (Correspondence relative to New Zealand, Parl. Papers, 1841, vol. xvii.; Bunbury, Reminiscences of a Veteran, vol. iii.) During the first Chinese war Nias was actively employed in the operations leading to the capture of Canton, and on 29 June 1841 he was nominated a C.B. The Herald returned to England in 1843, when Nias was placed on half pay. In June 1850 he commissioned the Agincourt, from which in August he was moved to the St. George, as flag-captain to Commodore Seymour, then superintendent of the dockyard at Devonport, and as captain of the ordinary. In 1852 Captain James Scott of the navy, in conversation with a friend at the United Service Club, made some reflections on Nias's conduct in China. Though duelling was then not quite extinct, the feeling of the navy was strongly opposed to it, and Nias took the then unusual practice of bringing an action against Scott, who, after the evidence of Sir Thomas Herbert and others, withdrew the imputation, and under pressure from the lord chief justice expressed his regret, on which the plaintiff accepted a verdict of 40s. and costs (Times, 22, 23 June; Morning Chronicle, 24 June 1852).\nNias commanded the ordinary at Devonport for the usual term of three years, and from 1854 to 1856 was superintendent of the victualling yard and hospital at Plymouth. He had no further service, but was made rear-admiral on 14 February 1857, vice-admiral 12 September 1863, K.C.B. 13 March 1867, and admiral 18 October 1867. After his retirement from active service he resided for the most part at Surbiton, but in 1877 moved to London, where he died on 17 December 1879. He was buried in the Marylebone cemetery at East Finchley. He married in 1855 Caroline Isabella, only daughter of John Laing, and left issue two sons and three daughters.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1894). \"Nias, Joseph\".

        "content": "Paul Gustav Morton (May 29, 1938 – January 17, 2024) was a Canadian entertainment executive who served as president of Odeon–Morton Theatres, Canwest, and the Global Television Network.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMorton was born on May 29, 1938, to Henry A. and Eva Rebecca (Ginsberg) Morton. His father was president of the Odeon–Morton Theatres Company. Morton was born and raised in Winnipeg and earned his Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws from the University of Manitoba.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter graduating, Morton became president of Odeon–Morton Theatres. From 1974 to 1975, he was president of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League. At 35 years old, Morton was the youngest president in team history.\nMorton invested in and served as president of Canwest, a company formed by Izzy Asper to operate an independent television station in Winnipeg. In 1975, Canwest agreed to purchase the assets of KCND-TV, a U.S. television station that targeted the Winnipeg market, if it received a licence from the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. The acquisition gave Canwest the equipment and staff it needed to launch a station and eliminated a competitor. Canwest beat out Craig Broadcasting for Winnipeg's new television licence and on August 31, 1975, the company launched CKND-TV.\nIn 1974, Morton, Asper, and Seymour Epstein formed Global Ventures Western Ldt. to aid Allan Slaight's IWC Communications in its purchase of Global Television Network, a regional television station serving Southern Ontario. In 1977, Global Ventures Western Ldt. purchased IWC's shares in Global and Morton became president of the network. In 1979, Global acquired the Toronto Metros-Croatia of the North American Soccer League, which the company renamed the Toronto Blizzard. In 1980, Morton sold Odeon–Morton Theatres to Canadian Odeon Theatres to focus on Global. In 1986, Morton and Epstein sued Asper, alleging he had reneged on a deal to sell them control of Global Ventures Western Ldt. The lawsuit was dismissed in 1989, but the court ordered that the company's shares be auctioned off. Asper outbid Morton and Epstein to acquire the network.\nMorton died on January 17, 2024.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"I Wanna Be Your Ghost\" (Japanese: 異世界混合大舞踏会, Hepburn: Isekai Kongō Dai-butōkai, lit. \"Grand Stage of Different Worlds\") (Japanese pronunciation: [isekai koꜜŋgoː daibɯtoꜜːkai]) is a song by Japanese singer-songwriter and musician Gen Hoshino. Written and produced by Hoshino as the main theme to the 2022 live-action film Yokaipedia , the song was released as a digital-exclusive single through Speedstar Records on July 18, 2022.\n\n\n== Background and composition ==\n\"I Wanna Be Your Ghost\" was written and produced by Gen Hoshino as the main theme to the film Yokaipedia  (2022), a live-action adaptation of a children's books series published by Kodansha. 3 minutes and 45 seconds-long, \"I Wanna Be Your Ghost\" is an alternative rock song that opens with a poppy melody and lyrically expresses an overlap in the worlds of humans and ghosts. In the chorus, the song uses the word うらめしや (urameshiya, roughly \"rueful), a Japanese word used to signify the appearance of ghosts. Backing Hoshino's vocals, it features electric instrumentation such as a variety of branded synthesizers, electric guitar and bass, theremin, Rhodes piano, and Clavinet.\nApproached by the film team for a theme to \"illustrate the [fantasy] world that kids play in\" and appeal to a wide audience, Hoshino wanted to create a song to \"break barriers of different worlds\" and allow humans and ghosts to dance together. He co-arranged and programmed the track with musician Mabanua, and sang on the background vocals with guitarist Ryosuke Nagaoka and Yokaipedia voice actors Rie Kugimiya (Book Boy), Hiro Shimono (Ittan-momen), and Tomokazu Sugita (Yamabiko); the voice actors were added to the chorus after they visited Hoshino during production, and are credited under their character names. Recording was headed by Mabanua, Shojiro Watanabe, and Shu Saida, with Watanabe also named for mixing and Takahiro Uchida credited with mastering.\n\n\n== Promotion and release ==\nOn May 25, 2022, it was announced that Hoshino had written the main theme song for Yokaipedia, titled \"I Wanna Be Your Ghost\". The announcement was accompanied by a \"main theme trailer\", showcasing the song over snippets from the film. On July 13, the song was announced for release as a digital single alongside a teaser to the song's music video, featuring an animated ghost dancing. Cover art and visuals were unveiled two days later, showing illustrations mixed into real pictures. Yokaipedia would mark the first shared appearance by Hoshino with his wife Yui Aragaki since their marriage in 2021.\nThe \"I Wanna Be Your Ghost\" single was released by the Victor Entertainment label Speedstar Records on July 18, 2022, five days before the film's premiere on July 22. The music video was announced for live premiere the same day at 0:00 JST. The video was produced by the then-newly opened animation studio Outline, led by director Yūki Igarashi. The video features a boy dancing with ghosts, 2D animated with \"simple lines and colors\", according to industry publication Animation Business. On July 22, Hoshino announced that Rie Kugimiya, Hiro Shimono, Tomokazu Sugita – the film voice actors featured in the song's background vocals – would guest appear on his radio program on All Night Nippon. Hoshino gave a debut performance of \"I Wanna Be Your Ghost\" in August 2022, appearing as a featured artist on Spotify's Go Stream video series. In December, Hoshino revealed that he would sing the song alongside \"Comedy\" (2022) during his timeslot at the 2022 Count Down TV Christmas special.\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nThe song peaked at No. 26 on the Oricon Combined Singles Chart and took No. 6 on Billboard Japan's Hot 100.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nCredits adapted from Hoshino's website.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"I Wanna Be Your Ghost\" (feat. Ghosts) at Gen Hoshino's official website",

        "content": "The 2024 Portsmouth City Council election is scheduled to be held on Thursday 2 May 2024, alongside the other local elections in the United Kingdom being held on the same day. 14 of the 42 members of Portsmouth City Council in Hampshire will be elected.\n\n\n== Background ==\nPortsmouth was created as a unitary authority in 1997. Labour controlled the council from its creation until 2000, when the council fell into no overall control. The Liberal Democrats first won the council in 2010, and held a majority until 2014. The Conservatives ran the council as a minority administration, with support from UKIP, until 2018, when the Liberal Democrats formed a minority administration which has governed Portsmouth since. In the previous election, the Liberal Democrats won 7 seats (up 1) with 29.3% of the vote, Labour won 2 with 27.5%, the Conservatives won 1 (down 5) with 19.6%, the Portsmouth Independent Party won 3 (up 3) with 16.2%, and independents won 1 (up 1) with 2.1%.\nThe seats up for election in 2024 were last contested in 2021; because of the delay of all local elections due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the seats are up for election after 3 years rather than the usual 4. In that election, the Conservatives gained 1 seat with 36.0% of the vote, the Liberal Democrats lost 2 with 26.6%, Labour held their 2 seats up for election with 28.0%, and independents gained 1 with 3.7%.\n\n\n== Previous council composition ==\n\nChanges:\n\nJudith Smyth readmitted to Labour\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Night of the Living Wage\" is the fourteenth episode of the thirty-fifth season of the American animated television series The Simpsons, and the 764th episode overall. It aired in the United States on Fox on April 7, 2024. The episode was directed by Chris Clements and written by Cesar Mazariegos.\nIn this episode, Marge works in a ghost kitchen when the family needs money. Jason Mantzoukas guest starred as Finn Bon Idée. The episode received positive reviews.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nLisa is taking Snowball II for a walk in a stroller when she attacks and injures an emotional support chicken. The Simpson family is forced to pay the veterinarian bill, so Marge finds a job working nights at a ghost kitchen for a food delivery app company. Without Marge, the family agrees to cook dinners at home together. At the kitchen, Marge and the workers are paid minimum wage with the potential for overtime pay, but they are quickly overwhelmed by the number of food orders.\nAfter a few months, Marge sleeps during the day but is happy that the family is cooking dinner together. Unknown to her, the family has been ordering dinner from the delivery app. At work, Marge learns that the workers are denied overtime pay and is asked to understand because the company does not have much money as a startup. However, Marge learns that the company CEO is a billionaire, so Lisa tells Marge to form a union. As punishment, Marge is forced to deliver food orders within a limited time or be fired. She fails to deliver the final order at the Simpson house on time and is fired.\nMarge is angry to learn that her family lied to her and that her earnings have been used to pay for food deliveries. The union goes on strike for firing Marge. The app company hires Homer as a spokesman, which pits him against Marge, and is paid with app gift cards. As the strikers protest, a mob led by Homer arrives. As they charge at each other, the CEO arrives to settle the issue by firing the strikers because they have been replaced by robots and delivery drones. Feeling guilty, Homer causes an electromagnetic pulse at the power plant to disable the drones. He and Marge forgive each other. The union is rehired as the kitchen workers, and the gift cards are used to pay the veterinarian bill.\n\n\n== Production ==\nWriter Cesar Mazariegos wrote the story based on his wife's role as a union activist as well as the push for Proposition 22 in California, which allowed app companies to classify drivers and deliverers as independent contractors instead of employees. The series already had an episode about unions with the fourth season episode \"Last Exit to Springfield,\" and Mazariegos wanted to show how the union-management relationship had changed since that time. The original story was written before the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes started. Production was stopped for the strike before the animation process started. After production resumed, the setting was changed from an e-commerce fulfillment warehouse to a ghost kitchen in order to make the story more relevant. Because of time constraints, Mazariegos thought it was more important to show that Homer and Marge reconciled, so the fate of the union was addressed with a voiceover narration.\nJason Mantzoukas guest starred as Finn Bon Idée, the CEO of the ghost kitchen company.\n\n\n== Cultural references ==\nThe one-shot kitchen scene is a parody of a similar scene from the episode \"Review\" from the television series The Bear. In addition, Marge spills a bucket of \"Mayo Edebiri,\" a reference to The Bear star Ayo Edebiri.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Viewing figures ===\nThe episode earned a 0.20 rating with 0.83 million viewers, which was the most-watched show on Fox that night.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nJohn Schwarz of Bubbleblabber gave the episode a 9 out of 10. He thought the episode had plenty of jokes and highlighted the performance by Mantzoukas. He also felt the episode was a modern update of \"Last Exit to Springfield\" while referencing the recently concluded Hollywood strikes.\nMike Celestino of Laughing Place thought the conclusion of the episode was rushed but praised the animation.\nCathal Gunning of Screen Rant enjoyed the story's reversal of Homer's role from \"Last Exit to Springfield\" because he is now the one against the union. He also liked that the story was made more interesting by making Marge and him clash.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Night of the Living Wage\" at IMDb",

        "content": "Camille Étienne, born 29 May 1998 in Grenoble, Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes, is a French environmental activist.\nA member of the duo Avant l'orage (Before the Storm), along with director Solal Moisan, she takes part in and leads acts of civil disobedience, lobbying of political and economic decision makers and raising public awareness.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Family and education ===\nCamille Étienne is originally from Savoie. She grew up in the village of Peisey-Nancroix. Her father is a mountain guide. Her mother was part of the French snowboard and climbing team before an accident ended her career.As a young girl, Étienne wanted to become a judge in family law. She obtained a master's degree in Economics at Sciences Po, Paris, before spending her gap year devoted to activism.\n\n\n=== Politicial activism ===\nIn 2018, she became spokesperson of the On est prêt collective. She spoke at the  European Parliament, notably alongside Greta Thunberg, Belgians Adélaïde Charlier and Anuna De Wever and the German Luisa Neubauer.\nIt was at Sciences Po Paris that Étienne turned her attention to the climate crisis. She became president of the student branch of Amnesty International. She was also elected, in 2018, to the student organisation NOVA.\nDuring lockdown, she created the collective 'Avant l'orage' (Before the Storm) which aims to bring together art and environmentalism. On 28 May 2020 the collective's YouTube channel released a video titled Wake Up. The video, filmed in the mountains, features the activist with a dancer and engineering graduate, Léa Durand. Étienne speaks about the climate emergency and reminds viewers, particularly those from Generation Y, on the need to act. Her words are accompanied by movements from the dancer. The video was a success, gaining 15 million views on various platforms and has been translated into Spanish, English, German and Portuguese.In August 2020, while speaking at the Medef summer school, she suggested \"working less, but maybe with more meaning\" to \"reinvent\" the world of business. She also questions the economic growth model, which, according to her, pushes us to \"produce too much\", \"exceed planetary limits\" and so \"directly endangers our lives\".On 10 February 2021, Étienne took part in a demonstration near the Élysée with politicians and activists including  Matthieu Orphelin, Cécile Duflot, Marie Toussaint and Cyril Dion. See denounced the \"lack of courage\" from President Emmanuel Macron, who, according to her, \"unraveled\" the proposals of the Citizens Convention for Climate when drafting the 2021 loi Climat (Climate Law).On 16 June 2021, she announced that, alongside activist Cyril Dion and MEP Pierre Larrouturou, she was filing a complaint against Jean Castex and four other ministers (Bruno Le Maire, Barbara Pompili, Emmanuelle Wargon and Jean-Baptiste Djebbari) for their inaction in the face of climate change. The French State having already been condemned on numerous occasions (most notably by the Affaire du siècle campaign), they argued that taking individual ministers to court would be a more effective action.Étienne is also engaged in campaigns against greenhouse gas emissions, in particular the EACOP, the world's largest heated oil pipeline planed in East Africa by TotalEnergies and the Lutzerath mining site in Germany, as well as the exploitation of the seabed.In May 2023, she published Pour un soulèvement écologique : dépasser notre impuissance collective (For an Ecological Uprising: Overcoming our Collective Helplessness).In October 2023, she joined the fight against the planned A69 motorway linking Castres (Tarn) to Toulouse.\n\n\n== Fame ==\nVanity Fair name her one of the \"50 French Women who made 2020\", alongside Adèle Haenel and Virginie Despentes.Technikart placed her as one of the \"100 who can save 2021\".Website Brut named her on a panel of \"31 who made 2022 happen\".\n\n\n== Films ==\n2020 : Réveillons-nous, co-directed with Solal Moisan\n2021 : Génération, co-directed with Solal Moisan\n2022 : Glacier, co-directed with Solal Moisan\n2022 : Désobéir, co-directed with Solal Moisan\n2023 : Pourquoi on se bat, co-directed with Solal Moisan\n2024 : PFAS : comment les industriels nous empoisonnent with Solal Moisan\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hubert de Garde de Vins, (? - 20 November 1589) while besieging the town of Grasse, is a leader of the leaguers in Provence.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHubert de Garde, lord of Vins, is the son of Gaspard de Garde president of the List of officers in the Parliament of Provence, and the sister of Jean V de Pontevès, Count of Carcès. Involved at a very young age in the troubles of the wars of religion, he was imprisoned in 1564 in Aix-en-Provence and released on the orders of Charles IX during his visit to this city in 1564. He was cornet of his company during the battle of Jarnac in 1569. He was squire to the Duke of Anjou, future Henry III, at the siege of La Rochelle (1572–1573). Disappointed by the attitude of Henry III after his return from Poland, he retired to Provence.\nMain support of his uncle Jean V of Pontevès Count of Carcés, in October 1578 he commanded the Carcist troops who besieged and devastated the village of Trans-en-Provence ; the reasons for this attack are in reality not religious but due to the fact that the peasants refused to provide the chores demanded by the lord of the place, Claude de Villeneuve. Hubert de Vins became the leader of the league in Provence after the death of his uncle in 1582. On the death of his brother-in-law the Count of Sault in 1586, he was chosen by the Parliament of Provence as generalissimo of the League army.\nIn 1587, Hubert de Vins participated in the victory of the Duke of Guise at Auneau; At the head of the leaguers, he led the fight against Jean Louis de Nogaret de La Valette. The league splits into two clans: a French part with the Carcists and a Savoyard part with de Vins and the Countess of Sault. Hubert de Vins is in favor of Savoyard aid in men and money but not of a regular military entry which would have given the Duke of Savoy power in Provence.\nOn 20 November 1589, Hubert de Vins was killed by a shot from an arquebus in front of Grasse, account of an eyewitness to the death of Vins. His disappearance opened the way for those who wanted to entrust the Duke of Savoy with the protection of a free and independent Provence.\nA magnificent funeral was held for him and a superb mausoleum was erected for him in the Saint-Sauveur cathedral of Aix-en-Provence.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nCatholic League (French)\n\n\n=== Bibliographie ===\nRaoul Busquet, Histoire de Marseille, édition Robert Laffont, Paris, 1978.\nWolfgang Kaiser, Marseille au temps des troubles (1559-1596), éditions de l’école des hautes études en sciences sociales, Paris, 1991,  ISBN 2-7132-0989-7.\nArlette Playoust, Foi et violence, la Provence au temps de la Réforme, Archives départementales des Bouches-du-Rhône, 1998, ISBN 2-86013-036-5.\nBernard Lucquiaud, Jean Clotaire Bonnet, Les Editions du Panthéon :  Une vie, une passion... et les pierres revivent à Vins. page 82 : Arbre généalogique de Hubert de Garde de Vins.

        "content": "Loyalties: A Son's Memoir is a memoir by journalist Carl Bernstein, published in 1989. The book is an account of his family's experience during the McCarthy era in the 1940s and 1950s. Bernstein's parents Sylvia and Alfred, both members of the American Communist Party, were called to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) and the Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security in the 1950s and were under FBI surveillance for four decades.\n\n\n== Background ==\nBernstein began working on Loyalties in 1977. He had just published The Final Days, his second book about the Watergate scandal written with Bob Woodward, and had resigned from The Washington Post. Bernstein had initially approached long-time New Yorker editor William Shawn to write a piece about his family during the McCarthy era but then received a $400,000 advance from Simon & Schuster to write a book, initially to be titled Progressive People. In 1978, he conducted several extended interviews of his parents, who were hostile to the project. According to New York magazine, \"Thirty years after rebuilding their shattered lives, the Bernsteins had no desire to dig up the shards and lacerate themselves again. Their days of living like fugitives were long over\". During that time, Bernstein also filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to obtain the file the FBI had compiled about his family over the course of four decades. Bernstein struggled to write the book and shelved the project in 1980. Following well-publicized personal and career struggles and spurred on by the counsel of writer Joan Didion, he returned to the book in 1984. In 1986, Bernstein signed a new $1 million contract with Simon & Schuster for two books. He finished writing Loyalties in January 1988 and spent another year editing it.\n\n\n== Content ==\nLoyalties recounts Bernstein's family's life in the 1940s and 1950s, during which his parents' left-wing activism and involvement in the labor movement brought them under heavy scrutiny from the FBI and the United States Congress. His father, Alfred Bernstein, served as an official in the United Federal Workers of America (after its 1946 merger, known as the United Public Workers of America) from 1937 to 1950. In 1947, President Harry S. Truman signed Executive Order 9835, which created 150 loyalty boards to investigate federal employees and to dismiss those found to be disloyal to the U.S. government. The Attorney General's office also compiled lists of \"subversive organizations\", which included many non-communist left-leaning institutions, and prior involvement with these could be grounds for investigation. Alfred Bernstein served as defense counsel in around 500 loyalty board cases, winning, according to his son, 80% of them.: 86 \nDuring interviews with their son, Sylvia and Alfred Bernstein admitted to having joined the American Communist Party in 1942, although they said that they had been largely inactive members and that they stopped attending party meetings after 1947.: 187  Throughout the book, Bernstein discusses his parents' ambivalence towards the party and the impact that their membership and activism had on him and the rest of his family. The revelation of the Bernsteins' Communist Party membership shocked some because even FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover had been unable to prove that Bernstein's parents had been party members.\nBernstein's FOIA requests led to his discovery that the FBI had compiled a 2,500-page file about his parents, starting in 1938.: 61  The bureau tracked his parents' daily movements and activities, including their son's bar mitzvah,: 141  as well as those of their friends and colleagues in the progressive movement. Multiple anonymous informants told the FBI that the Bernsteins were members of the Communist Party, leading Alfred to be called to testify before the Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security in 1951, while Sylvia was called to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in 1954.: 117 \nDuring the writing of Loyalties, Bernstein interviewed Clark Clifford, Truman's White House Counsel from 1946 to 1950. Clifford admitted to Bernstein that there had been no serious threat of communist infiltration of the federal government and that the Truman administration's loyalty program was created to fend of accusations from the Republican Party of being \"soft\" on communism.: 197–200 \n\n\n== Reception ==\nLoyalties received mixed to positive reviews. Publishers Weekly called it a \"pained, loving, intensely felt account of his parents' ordeal, and his own emotional upheaval, during President Harry Truman's loyalty purges\". The Chicago Tribune said Loyalties was a \"touching and remarkable book\". The Buffalo News wrote, \"This story... involves much more than either Bernstein's professional rehabilitation or his parents' nightmare. On a larger scale, the book, much like Watergate, reveals the dark side of American democracy... Bernstein, through his reporting skill, manages to bring everything together with painful exhilaration.\"\nIn a mixed review for The Washington Post, Martin Duberman wrote, \"As valuable as Carl Bernstein's story is in reminding us of the terrible human toll of the McCarthy years, and in personalizing it through the experiences of his own parents, his book falls uncomfortably between impersonal history and personal recollection. In the end, the history is too shallow and fragmentary, the recollections too tame and episodic.\" The New York Times gave Loyalties a similarly mixed assessment, praising Bernstein's retelling of childhood memories and his portrait of the Washington Jewish community but criticizing  his historical and political analysis. In the Los Angeles Times, historian Eric Foner said that \"Loyalties fails both as autobiography and as political analysis\" but praised Bernstein for \"[driving] home a truly subversive idea: Rather than a nest of spies, the Communist Party was an integral and honorable part of the American radical tradition.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAuthor's website's page for the book",

        "content": "Wolfgang Junker (23 February 1929 – 9 April 1990) was a German construction manager and politician of the Socialist Unity Party (SED).\nIn the German Democratic Republic, he served as the longtime Minister for Construction and was a member of the Central Committee of the SED. He committed suicide in April 1990, having lost power and being indicted on abuse of office.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nJunker was a member of the Jungvolk and the Hitler Youth from 1939 to 1945. After attending elementary and middle school, he completed an apprenticeship as a bricklayer in 1945 and worked in that profession until 1949 in Quedlinburg.In 1949, he joined the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED) and studied at the Engineering School for Construction in Osterwieck until 1952. From 1952 to 1953, he was a construction manager during the construction of Stalinallee in Berlin, and until 1954, he worked with the Bau-Union Nord in Glowe.He then served as the director of state-owned enterprises: from 1955 to 1957 at the VEB Excavation and Conveying Works Berlin and from 1958 to 1961 at the VEB Industrial Construction Brandenburg.\n\n\n== Political career ==\n\n\n=== Minister ===\nFrom 1961 to 1963, he was deputy minister, and from 1963 to 1989, Minister for Construction of the GDR. From 1972 to 1989, he was chairman of the GDR's delegation to and from 1973 also chairman of the permanent commission of Comecon for cooperation in construction.From 1967 to 1971, he was a candidate member and from June 1971 (VIII. Party Congress) until its resignation in December 1989, he was a full member of the Central Committee of the SED. He additionally became member of the Volkskammer in 1976.In October 1979, Junker became the first official government member of the GDR to visit the West Germany and held discussions with his counterpart, Federal Minister for Regional Planning, Building and Urban Development Dieter Haack and State Minister Hans-Jürgen Wischnewski.\nJunker was awarded the Patriotic Order of Merit in Gold in 1969, the Honorary Clasp to this order in 1979, the Karl Marx Order in 1976, the Gold Star of People's Friendship in 1984, and the Grand Star of People's Friendship in 1989.\n\n\n=== Peaceful Revolution ===\nDuring the Wende, on 7 November 1989, he resigned alongside rest of the government led by Willi Stoph. He was the longest-serving GDR minister at that time.\n\n\n=== Downfall and Death ===\nFrom January to February 1990, he was in pre-trial detention in Berlin-Hohenschönhausen on suspicion of embezzlement of state funds and breach of the constitution.He was accused of illicitly collecting 20,000 East German marks annually as an honorary member of the GDR Construction Academy. He had also appointed SED leader Erich Honecker and his economics czar Günter Mittag as honorary members. The change of statutes allowing this was deemed unconstitutional. Additionally, it was alleged that he used funds from a reserve fund of his ministry to build private houses for SED officials.On February 28, Junker was released due to his poor health condition. On 9 April 1990, he committed suicide by hanging in his Berlin apartment.\n\n\n== References ==",

First built in 1902 by the philanthropist Mahmoud Ibrahim Shabandar during the Ottoman period, the mosque can accommodate at least 140 worshippers within its area of 300 square metres. Its summer prayer hall, or musalla, can accommodate at least 50 worshippers.\nIn 1906, Mahmoud Ibrahim Shabandar died, and he was buried in the garden of the mosque. The mosque also experienced a major renovation in 1938. Currently, the mosque does not have any endowments, but the funding for restoration or repairs is done by the current member of the Shabandar family, Sayyid Sa'eed Ibrahim al-Shabandar. \nOther lesser known features of the mosque include a residential space for the needy, as well as a small private cemetery for the Shabandar family that is located in the mosque's garden. There is also a small basement underneath the mosque.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mosques in Iraq\nList of mosques in Baghdad\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Uno is the sole album by the Italian progressive rock band Panna Fredda. The album was recorded in 1970 but their record company delayed the release until 1971 and provided very little marketing support. As a consequence the album was not successful and the group disbanded. Uno was recorded in 1970 making it \"one of the first classics of Italian progressive rock.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe album did not have a significant impact on release; however, it has been positively reviewed in later years. Dag Erik Asbjørnsen reviewing Uno in Scented gardens of the mind said: \"The secrets behind the great success of this album are magnificent songwriting and musicianship, inventive instrumental ideas (often with references to classical music) and the consistent atmosphere throughout the album.\"\nJerry Lucky in The progressive rock files said: \"A sound that is reminiscent of their contemporaries Banco and Semiramis only a little spicier sounding.\" Augusto Croce in Italian prog said: \"With a great album, highly representative of the Italian prog sound, Panna Fredda should have deserved more success\" and \"The voice is good, the lyrics original and the album has no weak spots.\"\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nAngelo Giardinelli – guitar, lead vocals\nLino Stopponi – keyboards\nPasquale \"Windy\" Cavallo – bass\nRoberto Balocco – drums\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\nLater reissues added bonus tracks from Panna Fredda's two singles and some unreleased tracks.\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nUno at AllMusic\nUno at Discogs (list of releases)\nUno at MusicBrainz\nUno at Prog Archives\nUno at YouTube\nPanna Fredda at Italian Prog website",

        "content": "Janine Mountain is located in the Ha'il region in the middle of Lake Janine, which is rich in groundwater and has a large cave about 100 meters long. There are many ancient Thamudic and Abyssinian inscriptions scattered on the rocks of the mountain, in addition to a large collection of human and animal writings and drawings. Janine is located about 75 km east of Ha'il.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nJanine Mountain and Cave is located 75 kilometers northeast of Ha'il province. The mountain is considered one of the tourist sites in the region, because it includes one of the oldest archaeological prehistoric caves in which humans settled before the Ha'il region, It also features a collection of rock paintings and rock carvings that are expressive in their themes, compositions, and elements. On the walls of its cave, tourists can see a variety of paintings and engravings that have been carved using various artistic methods, including intaglio, relief, slitting, and hollowing. Passing through successive historical eras until before Christ, the mountain's inscriptions and drawings represent the activities of prehistoric man and images of his daily life. The cave includes ancient Thamudic writings and various human and animal drawings.\n\n\n== Archaeological value ==\nArchaeological evidence is scattered in the 3-kilometer-long Janine Mountain off the Great Nafud Desert, although archaeological explorations of the site did not reveal a residential settlement, however, the dry lake and the buried wells in the northeastern parts of the site confirm that a settlement once existed nearby, which may have been buried by the Nafud sands that cover much of the site. In the light of scientific studies, it is concluded that the site of Janine was inhabited during the fourth millennium BC. This idea is supported by laboratory studies of some of the site's petroglyphs, the results of the analysis of the antler layer taken from the surface of the caribou drawing indicated that it was dated between 6,000 and 4,000 years before present. The presence of several ancient northern Arabic inscriptions (Thamudic) at the Janine site also leads to a conclusion that Janine was heavily settled during the period when the Thamudic line spread in the region, which is during the second half of the first millennium BC. The ruins of the Janine site are based on two archaeological themes:\n\nA group of petroglyphs found painted on the rocks of Janine Mountain, embody those commonly seen themes in North Arabia's rock paintings, which mostly contain human and animal figures such as cows, ibexes, camels, horses, and some species of dogs. Also, a set of geometric shapes was revealed near a natural rock shelter about 100 meters east of Janine Mountain, which came in the form of circles, semicircles, and perpendicular lines. Among the petroglyphs at the site are those uncovered in the Janine Cave, which portrays some of the social and religious life of the region's inhabitants during the first millennium BC. On the sides of the cave, a row of human figures with animal heads, drawn in a sketchy style, appear to be in motion, as if the artist wanted to show them dancing, in addition to these drawings, there are drawings of perhaps two women whose heads are depicted as an animal head like a horse or donkey, they are dressed below the knee and it is not clear from their details whether they are made of leather or cloth, the details suggests a skill in cutting and Knitting. In addition, the cave contains repeated prints of hands, that can indicate an intellectual significance associated with religious doctrines in the ancient world. The handprints in the Janine Cave appear to date from the second half of the first century BC. This opinion is supported by some framed paintings accompanied by some Thamudic inscriptions dating back to the second half of the first century BC.\nThe second theme that captures some of the cultural life of the site's inhabitants at the time, on the surrounding rock faces, a series of inscriptions written in the ancient northern Arabic script (Thamudic) contains the names of the inhabitants of the region at that time, one of which mentions a tribe called (Sabah). The inscriptions on the site are generally of the memorial type, which only mentions the names of people, some of their feelings and emotions towards their families and loved ones, and some of their prayers directed to their gods to ask for help and contentment.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of mountains in Saudi Arabia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nImage of an inscription found in Janine Mountain\nPainting inside Janine Cave",

        "content": "James Henry Cowan (28 September 1856 – 7 August 1943) was an Army officer, who played in the 1878 FA Cup final for the Royal Engineers A.F.C., and represented Great Britain in shooting at the 1908 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n== Army career ==\nCowan was born in Chiswick, the son of a solicitor from Mid Calder, and was educated at Edinburgh Academy, Cheltenham College, and the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst  In 1875, he received the prize from the RMA for shooting in 1875, earning himself a breech-loading revolver; his fellow prize-winners included future football team-mates Charles Mayne, Horace Barnet, and Oliver Ruck.  The following year, he passed out of Sandhurst with the highest mark in the year, his 40,117 marks being nearly 5,000 clear of the second student, and he was recommended for - and accepted - a commission in the Royal Engineers.\nHe became an instructor in Fortifications at the RMA and was mentioned in dispatches for his service in the Boer War. In 1906–07 he commanded the Royal Engineers in Chatham, and \"rendered notable service\" in the First World War as Assistant Director of Fortifications.  By the time of his retirement, he had reached the rank of colonel.\n\n\n== Football career ==\nAlthough his school was not notable for association football, Cowan was chosen as a full-back soon after joining the Engineers, making his debut at the Kennington Oval in October 1876 in a defeat to the Wanderers.  He made his competitive debut a fortnight later in the first round of the 1876–77 FA Cup, again at the Oval and again as a back, but this time in a victory, over the Old Harrovians.\nHe played in all of the Sappers' Cup ties that season, and repeated the feat in 1877–78, but this time all the way to the final, one stage further than 1876–77.  However the Sappers lost 3–1 to the Wanderers in the final.\nCowan only played once in the 1878–79 FA Cup, in the second round at Oxford University; he was praised for his kicking but the Sappers crashed 4–0.  He was a regular in the 1879–80 competition and captained the side in the semi-final replay against Oxford University, but the Students once more beat the Sappers, with the only goal coming in the last ten minutes.\nCowan then stepped back from the football side, making a one-off comeback in the 1885–86 first round tie at home to the Old Foresters, but in a sign of how much the game had passed the Sappers by, the Foresters won 5–1, the second Forester goal being a deflection off Cowan.\n\n\n== Shooting career ==\nCowan regularly shot for the Army at the Imperial Meeting, and was captain of the Army Eights from 1908 to 1912. He also represented Scotland in the Elcho Shield on many occasions. \nCowan made his Bisley début at the age of 16 in 1872 (while still at school) and won the Spencer Cup. In 1935, he represented Cheltenham again at Bisley, in the Veterans Match. His biggest individual success at Bisley was winning the Wantage Prize of £10 in 1897, for scoring 23 points on a disappearing target at 200 yards.  Cowan was a former vice-president of the National Rifle Association and a member of committee of the Army Rifle Association.\nCowan took part in the Running Deer - Individual Competition at the 1908 Summer Olympics, finishing 6th in the single shot (with 21 points out of a possible 40) and 8th in the double shot (with 24 points out of a possible 80).\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHe married when he was based in Kent in April 1880.  In the early 1920s Cowan moved to Moffat and served on the town council from 1930 to 1933.  He lived his final years in Linlithgow, and died in Moffat in 1943.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Siege of Dansborg (Danish; Belejringen af Dansborg) or the Siege of Fort Dansborg (Danish; Belejringen af Fort Dansborg), was a short siege lasting from 20 to 30 December 1644, between general Tiagepule of Thanjavur and the Danish command at Fort Dansborg. The conflict started over the Danish rejection of the general's demand to tax Tranquebar, and as a result, a series of confrontations followed. The confrontations had no major result, and an armistice may have been signed.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nDanish India was established in 1620 at Tranquebar. A fort to secure the land and commerce in the area was constructed, given the name of Fort Dansborg. Tranquebar would go on to be the center of commerce and trade conducted by Danish merchants in the Bay of Bengal. Tranquebar was surrounded by the Thanjavur Nayak kingdom on land, and was to give an annual tribute to the Nayak, though this right to tax Tranquebar was quickly surrendered to the Danes.\n\n\n=== Prelude ===\nOn 20 December 1644 the Thanjavurian general, Tiagepule, had appeared with a large army outside Tranquebar. He demanded 600 Danish rigsdaler  from the Danes in Tranquebar as a present. Regnapule, a brother of the Thanjavurian general, was granted a lease of Karaikal and the southern region of Thanjavur in exchange for a payment of 900,000 rigsdaler to the nayak. As part of the agreement, Regnapule had the authority to levy taxes on the residents at his discretion in order to raise the necessary funds for the payment. However, the nayak had previously renounced his right to tax Tranquebar, leading to rejection from the local inhabitants towards the general's demands.\n\n\n== Siege and skirmishes ==\nIn response to the Danish rejection, General Tiagepule surrounded the town, resulting in the halting of commercial goods. This status could not be substained for a long period of time for the Danes at Tranquebar, and therefore the commander, Anders Nielsen, subsequently made a sortie with his men and drove the Thanjavurians away.\nA couple of days later on Christmas day, while the Christian Danes were attending church service, Tiagepule attacked the northern part of Tranquebar, burning numerous houses and taking a quantity of textiles belonging to the Danish East India Company. Nielsen remained in church until the sermon was over, yet directly after, he hastily assembled some of Dansborg's soldiers and again drove Tiagepule's army away.\nThe Thanjavurian army then launched a second attack during the night and burned a few more houses. In reaction, Nielsen collected a large company and at dawn the next morning the two opposing sides met in battle. The battle insued for three hours. Tiagepule lost 17 men, while the Danes had one wounded, being commander Nielsen himself, who had a bullet strike his left arm.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThere seems to be no more skirmishes after this, and the belligerents may have agreed to an armistice. The reason that no skirmish occurred afterwards may be because of the Danish lack of gunpowder. At least on the 30 December 1644 Anders Nielsen writes to William Leyel \"you should know that we have no more powder in store.\"\n\n\n=== Negotiations with the Nayak ===\n\nLater, the nayak, Vijaya Raghava, sent a message to the Danes demanding they present him with gifts.\nNotably the nayak suggested a suitable gift would be goods to the value of 8.000–10.000 Danish Rigsdaler. This value could not be gathered in Tranquebar, and the council at Dansborg therefore decided to send Anders Nielsen. With an Asian elephant, and other minor goods, such as silk and cloth, Nielsen led out for the Nayak. Nielsen was  given a kind reception by the nayak, and the two then started discussing Tiagepule's attacks.\nThe nayak seems to have encouraged Nielsen to wait a couple of days for Tiagepule himself to arrive for discussing the war reparations. Yet, the nayak's emotions quickly changed and suddenly he demanded the Danes to, again, pay an annual tribute and additionally assist the nayak in his foreign wars. Despite complaining about the demands, Nielsen finally agreed to them and signed the agreement.\nIn the end, the nayaks anger seized, and he agreed to pay the damages for the destruction caused by Tiagepule.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDano-Mughal War – Danish colonial conflict against the Mughal Empire\nCattle War – Conflict between Danish India and the Thanjavur Maratha kingdom\nOve Gjedde – Danish nobleman and Admiral of the Realm\nThanjavur Maratha kingdom – Principality of Tamil Nadu\nDannemarksnagore – City/town in West Bengal, IndiaPages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback\nTillali Massacre – Massacre and Battle in Tillali, India 1756\n\n\n== References ==",

This winding, stream flows south, then southeast to its mouth on the Sulphur River, five miles west of the Bowie county line. \nThe nearby town of Shawnee, Texas took its name from Shawnee Creek. \n\n\n== History ==\nThe entire area historically was part of the Caddo Confederacy.  French explorer Jean Baptiste Bénard de La Harpe founded the military fort Le Poste des Cadodaquious in 1719.  The post was garrisoned with French soldiers including Jean Baptiste Brevelle from Fort St. Jean Baptiste des Natchitoches and their Native American wives, including Anne des Cadeaux.    The fort remained in continuous use until 1770. In the 1820s, the Shawnee temporarily settled in the area.  Shawnee Creek is named for a band of Shawnee that lived along the banks of the creek. \n\n\n== See also ==\nBrevelle Lake\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ezzatullah Foladvand (Persian: عزت‌الله فولادوند; born \tDecember 27, 1935, in Isfahan) is a notable Iranian writer and translator renowned for his adeptness in translating complex philosophical works into Persian.\n\n\n== Background ==\nEzzatullah Foladvand was born in Isfahan in 1935. His father, Gholamreza Foladvand, served as a judge and held various administrative positions, including governorships in Khuzestan and Fars, as well as the head of the General Registry Office. His grandfather, Azizullah Khan Foladvand, was a respected politician and a member of the \nNational Consultative Assembly.\nAfter completing his primary education in Tehran, Ezzatullah pursued further studies in England. However, due to circumstances, he returned to Iran and completed his secondary education there. He later ventured to Paris, where he studied medicine for two years. However, his encounter with Bertrand Russell's Philosophical Problems led him to shift his focus to philosophy. He then proceeded to the United States to pursue his academic journey in philosophy, obtaining his undergraduate, master's, and doctoral degrees from Columbia University. Notable scholars such as Arthur Danto and Robert Cummings influenced his academic pursuits during this time.\nFrom 1964 to 1980, Foladvand held various positions within the National Iranian Oil Company and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance, all while actively participating in cultural endeavors. His translation work flourished during these years, with several of his translations receiving recognition, including Philosophy of Kant and \"Consciousness and Society,\" by \nH. Stuart Hughes which were selected for inclusion in the eighth and ninth editions of the Islamic Republic of Iran's yearbook, respectively.\n\n\n== Foladvand's Views on Translation ==\nFoladvand holds strong convictions regarding the art of translation. He emphasizes the importance of fidelity to the original text, advocating for translations that capture the essence and intent of the original author without resorting to ambiguity or embellishment. Despite the challenges inherent in translating philosophical texts, Foladvand asserts that preserving the spirit of the Persian language should remain paramount, drawing attention to the rich tradition of Persian literature and the wealth of linguistic resources available.\nHe underscores the significance of maintaining the tone of the original text, asserting that deviations can hinder the reader's comprehension and emotional engagement. Foladvand advocates for retranslation when deemed necessary, driven by advancements in language and interpretation.\nIn selecting works for translation, Foladvand prioritizes texts that he deems significant for his compatriots and personally resonates with. He believes that ignorance or incomplete knowledge often underlie societal challenges and underscores the continuous need for intellectual enrichment through translation.\nFoladvand encourages writers and translators to approach their craft with diligence and depth of understanding, cautioning against the indiscriminate use of language trends or foreign influences that may not resonate with the Iranian audience.\nHe warns against blindly following Western trends in translation, emphasizing the importance of tailoring translations to the needs and cultural context of Iranian readers, rather than solely catering to Western sensibilities.\nIn essence, Foladvand's approach to translation reflects a commitment to intellectual integrity, linguistic precision, and cultural relevance, ensuring that Persian-speaking audiences have access to nuanced and authentic interpretations of global knowledge and literature.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Adidas Nativo is a family and brand of association football balls. Used as official match balls of Major League Soccer and MLS All-Star Game, the Nativo balls have had different numbers in their names applied to them to distinguish them in their construction.\nBefore the adoption of the brand, as official match balls of MLS were used variants of Adidas Teamgeist (2006–2009) and of Adidas Jabulani (2010–2011), while between 2012 and 2014 were used the balls of the line Adidas Prime.\n\n\n== 2015–2017 ==\nFrom 2015 to 2017 the line of Nativo balls adopted the technology developed with Adidas Brazuca, already used for the last balls of Adidas Prime's line. The first version, Adidas Nativo 1, used a blue and red template (using the colors of US and Canada flags) with the same shape of Adidas Conext 15 balls. For the international day for the fight against breast cancer the MLS used a variant with a pink decoration. Adidas Nativo 2 showed again a blue and red decoration, but it adopted the same template as the balls that replaced the line started with Brazuca, which was first used for Adidas Beau Jeu. For the international day for the fight against breast cancer the MLS used a variant with a pink decoration, while another variant was used as official match ball of 2016 MLS All-Star Game. Adidas Nativo 3 adopted the same template as the balls that replaced the line of Adidas Conext 15, which was first used for Adidas Krasava, and showed the flags of Canada and United States. A variant was used as official match ball of 2017 MLS All-Star Game.\n\n\n== 2018–2020 ==\nBetween 2018 and 2020 the line of Nativo balls adopted the same technology of Adidas Telstar 18. Adidas Nativo 4 used the same template of Telstar 18, but with a blue and red decoration. To promote a campaign against pediatric cancer the MLS used also a variant with a yellow decoration, while another variant was used as official match ball of 2018 MLS All-Star Game. The official match ball of 2019 MLS season presented by Adidas was Adidas Nativo Questra, that showed a red and blue variant of Adidas Conext 19 pattern, while the name paid homage to the official match ball of the 1994 FIFA World Cup, tournament held it the United States. To promote a campaign against pediatric cancer the MLS used also a variant with a yellow decoration, while a purple variant was used as official match ball of 2019 MLS All-Star Game. On the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the foundation of MLS, Adidas presented as the official match ball of 2020 MLS season Adidas Nativo XXV, that showed a green and blue variant of Adidas Uniforia and Adidas Tsubasa pattern. To promote a campaign against pediatric cancer the MLS used also a variant with a yellow decoration. The same type of pattern was also used for Adidas Nativo 21 e Adidas MLS Pro, respectively, the official match balls of 2021 and 2022 MLS season.\n\n\n== Since 2023 ==\nSince 2023 the balls adopted the SpeedShell technology developed for Adidas Al Rihla and its variants. As official match ball of 2023 MLS season Adidas announced Adidas MLS Pro 2023, that proposed again a blue and red pattern for the decoration. A special version branded by Marvel was used as official match ball of 2023 MLS All-Star Game. For 2024 MLS season Adidas announced as official match ball MLS Pro 2024, that showed a multicolored pattern.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Giuseppe Castellucci (28 April 1863 – 8 April 1939) was an Italian architect, mostly specializing in restoration or updating works in a Neo-gothic style. \n\n\n== Biography ==\nGiuseppe Castellucci was born in Arezzo, and active throughout Tuscany as an architect. He studied at the Museo Industriale of Turin. Among his mentors and teachers were Luigi del Moro, Vincenzo Micheli, and Crescentino Caselli.\nAs a young man, he helped illustrate with K. Von Stegmann and H. Von Geymuller the text of Architetture del Rinascimento in Toscana (Die Architekur der Renaissance in Toscana), published in 1885 in Munich. He became a frequent commentator and illustrater for the journal of Ricordi di Architettura. In 1889, he was appointed as professor of Architectural design for the Accademia delle Belle Arti di Firenze. In 1892, he was appointed as architect for the Office of Conservation of Monuments in Tuscany. He was appointed as director of the Opera del Duomo of Florence. In some restorations he worked with Camillo Boito. He also worked for private patrons.  \nHe is noted for often adding novel and somewhat anachronistic details to his projects to flavor them with neogothic details. He was active in the restoration of the urban cityscape of Arezzo.\nHe was made a member or an adjunct of the Accademia delle Belle Arti of Carrara, the Accademia Albertina, the Società Colombaria of Florence, the Accademia Petrarca di Lettere, Arti e Scienze of Arezzo, and of the Association of the Virtuosi del Pantheon of Rome. He was awarded the medal of the Order of the Crown of Italy, and inducted into the Order of Marucelliana.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nMiano, Giuseppe (1978). \"CASTELLUCCI, Giuseppe\".

        "content": "The pivot tooth is a fixed dental prosthesis used to rebuild a tooth. It is a type of crown-root foundation, but it is an independent supplement and usually consists of a pin or peg and a full crown permanently connected (i.e., without cement) and placed in the patient's oral cavity during a single visit. It often includes a protective element called a ferrule.\nPivot teeth were developed to shorten the execution cycle and skip some laboratory steps. Although they could last for many years when used according to indications and contraindications, pivot teeth did not meet the requirements and are no longer used. Better results are achieved by permanently cementing the crown-root foundation and further crafting the crown as if it were a natural tooth stump prepared for the crown. Otherwise, the laboratory connection of the crown to the foundation carries a greater risk of inaccuracies, subsequent crown leakage, cement washout, and tooth decay.\n\n\n== History ==\nAt the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries, dentists made the first attempts to replace single tooth gaps using pegs anchored in the root canal of the tooth. However, due to the lack of appropriate dental cements or adhesives, they were fastened on gold or platinum foil, as well as linen, cotton, and silk. Recommendations from individual scientists (L. Koecker, B. Rush, T. Kaczorowski) quickly emerged to first treat the tooth root due to the odontogenic focal infection theory.\nIn the mid-19th century, new methods of pin fixation emerged: a gold pin on gold foil (Gustav Blume, 1850) and on gutta-percha (J. Taft, 1859). In 1880, Casius M. Richmond patented the pivot tooth with a ferrule and his own porcelain firing method. At the same time, pivot teeth by Marshall L. Logan gained significant popularity.\nRegardless of the development of pivot teeth, the technique of restoring a tooth with a full crown on the stump of the patient's own tooth developed independently, which is still used today.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nA pivot tooth consists of a pin inserted into a prepared root canal of the tooth and a complete prosthetic crown permanently attached to this pin, rebuilding the entire tooth crown. Some pivot teeth have a third element, called a ferrule, which is a root cap protecting the supportive surface of the root from decay. Depending on the presence of this ferrule, pivot teeth can be divided into two groups:\n\nWithout protection of the root supportive surface – pivot teeth with a porcelain crown (e.g., Davis pivot tooth, Logan pivot tooth) or with an acrylic crown. In the Davis pivot tooth, the crown is not previously permanently attached to the pin. The dentist applies it to the pin during the same visit when the pin is cemented into the patient's tooth.\nWith protection of the root supportive surface – pivot teeth with a Richmond ferrule (e.g., Richmond pivot tooth, invented by Casius M. Richmond in 1880) or a Schröder ferrule (e.g., Schrödera pivot tooth), used with an acrylic crown, metal-acrylic composite crown, or metal-porcelain crown. The ferrule is used to protect the tooth from decay, from mechanical injury in the case of a deep bite, and in case it's necessary to connect the pivot tooth with metal parts of further prosthetic elements.\nThe pin is typically metal – platinum (formerly) or steel under a porcelain crown, 18-karat gold, gold-platinum alloy, or steel under an acrylic crown. The Richmond ferrule consists of gold components (18 or 22 karats) and gold solder (18 or 20 karats respectively); the Schröder ferrule consists of 20-karat gold, a gold-platinum alloy, or chromium-nickel steel. The crown can be metal, acrylic, composite, or porcelain.\n\n\n== Indications and contraindications ==\nIndications for performing a pivot tooth mostly overlap with today's indications for full crowns: destruction of the tooth crown (due to decay or trauma), concern about mechanical damage (numerous fillings with thin walls), pathological changes in enamel (discoloration, erosion, Hutchinson's teeth), and anchoring for a bridge.\nPivot teeth without a ferrule are indicated when there is no tendency for decay, the root of the tooth is intact, and in a simple or deep bite where the front teeth (upper and lower) do not touch each other.\nThey can be used in all teeth except molars. It is important to relieve the incisal edges of the pivot teeth and consider using this restoration in a deep bite.\n\n\n== Workmanship ==\n\n\n=== Without protection of the root supportive surface ===\nPreparation of a tooth for pivot teeth is similar for each type, but there may be slight deviations from the general scheme due to differences in structure. After endodontic treatment of the abutment tooth, its canal is prepared using a round bur, up to 1.5 mm in diameter in upper central incisors and canines, and 1.3 mm in other teeth. The root surface is then cut with a carborundum stone in a slanted manner, with a mid-root groove, ensuring better force distribution than horizontal cuts.\nNext, the dentist selects a prefabricated porcelain crown, paying attention to color, shape, and size. After fitting, the restoration is cemented in the abutment tooth (for Davis-type pivot tooth, the post is first cemented, followed by crown placement).\nThe dentist may also fabricate an acrylic crown (acrylic, unlike porcelain, exhibits physiological wear), by modeling it with white wax in the patient's mouth and sending it with the pin to the dental laboratory, where a ready-made pivot tooth is obtained. This is called the direct method. Alternatively, the indirect method can be used. The dentist should record the occlusion with the post in the canal, take an impression including the post and adjacent teeth, an impression of opposing teeth, choose the color of the future crown, and provide the data to the dental laboratory. There, under laboratory conditions, in the case of the indirect method, the technician first models a wax crown on the pin, and then (in both methods) casting and direct mechanical connection of the crown with the coronal part of the post, i.e., without using cement, through soldering and polymerization. The dental technician then trims, polishes, and provides the dentist with the finished crown permanently attached to the pivot tooth. The entire procedure is completed and cemented in the patient's mouth during one visit.\n\n\n=== With protection of the root supportive surface ===\nIn the case of a Richmond pivot tooth, the abutment tooth is trimmed to a height of 2–3 mm above the gum line and prepared as for a subgingival metal crown. A subgingival ring for the ferrule is created, descending 1–1.5 mm below the gum line, fitted to the prepared crown just like a metal crown ring. Next, the abutment tooth is shaped with a roof-like slant (with the lingual part trimmed horizontally) up to the level of the prepared tooth edges, and the ferrule is fitted to the bottom of the prepared tooth. An opening is made in the bottom of the post for the pin, which is then inserted and soldered.\nIf the root structure is damaged by decay, a cast Schröder ferrule can be used. The tooth is cleaned of decay, attempting to preserve the oval shape of the canal and a roof-like finish of the supporting surface, although this surface is typically irregular after preparation. Then, the pin is fitted, and damaged root tissues are reconstructed with wax, and the data is sent to the dental laboratory, where the entire structure is cast in metal.\nAfter fitting the ferrule in the patient's mouth, the dentist takes impressions, registers the occlusion, and sends the data to the technician. The technician models the crown in wax and then converts it to acrylic (if the pivot tooth is to be a standalone restoration) or fabricates a composite crown (metal-acrylic or metal-porcelain) if integration with further prosthetic components is required. Finally, the pivot tooth is cemented in the patient's mouth during the last visit.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nMajewski, Stanisław Władysław (2005).

It is composed of the chairs or conveners of relevant committees of each legislature.\nThe forum was established in 2022 as the successor to the Inter-Parliamentary Forum on Brexit which first met in 2017 to help coordinate the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union.\n\n\n== Terms of reference ==\nThe forum's terms of reference were adopted following its first meeting in February 2022 and are as follows:\n\"The Interparliamentary Forum provides a collective space to share information about, and does not supplant, each parliament’s scrutiny of its executive. \nInitial priorities for the forum will include oversight of:\n\nInter-governmental relations including agreeing a joint annual report on addressing common scrutiny challenges;\nThe operation of international agreements including the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, the Withdrawal Agreement and the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol;\nThe UK internal market including the UK Internal Market Act and Common Frameworks;\nThe impact of the new constitutional arrangements on the legislative process including the use of secondary powers and the legislative consent process.\nThe Interparliamentary Forum will aim to improve scrutiny in these areas through both a mutual exchange of information and best practice at a parliamentary level and in seeking a consistent approach to improving accountability at both a Ministerial and inter-governmental level.\"\n\n\n== Meetings ==\nThe Inter-Parliamentary Forum usually meets twice a year, in spring and in autumn.\n\n\n== See also ==\nIntergovernmental relations in the United Kingdom\nBritish–Irish Parliamentary Assembly\nEU–UK Parliamentary Partnership Assembly\nLegislatures of the United Kingdom\nConference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nScottish Parliament: Interparliamentary Forum\nSenedd Cymru: Interparliamentary Forum\nNorthern Ireland Assembly: Interparliamentary Forum",

During his tenure in Loulé, he served on the Committee of the Regions of the European Union from 1994 to 1999. He also chaired the Algarve division of the Socialist Party.\nJoaquim Vairinhos worked as a consultant, teacher, guidance inspector, and pedagogical coordinator for the Ministry of Education.

Jamaat expelled Mujibur Rahman for his opinions over the party's role in the Liberation War of 1971 and his demands for reforms within the party, while Solaiman Chowdhury left the party over differences of opinion on Jamaat's reformation.\nOn 2021 February 9, 25 leaders from Jamaat-e-Islami and its sister concerns joined this political party.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Muhammad Syaiful bin Doli Sharif (born 16 December 1988), commonly known by his stage name Syaiful Zero, is a Malaysian actor and comedian. Due of the feminine roles he adopts, Syaiful was given the nickname Mawar, which means rose.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nThe three brothers, Muhammad Syaiful, Sharif Kadir, and Sharif Kunal, are from Kudat town in Sabah and are the sons of traditional fisherman Sharif Doli. With just RM$350 in their bank account each month, they had to work hard to support their seven siblings. As the oldest, Syaiful made the decision to leave school at age 13 in order to support his father financially. He said in an interview with InTrend that he felt sorry for his father, who was raising the family alone while his four younger siblings were still in school. He left the school system.\nSyaiful began by making around RM$82 per month working in a school canteen. From there, he went on to work as a fisherman for a short while before working at KFC Kudat. In Sabah, employment at KFC was considered glamorous in addition to the higher salary. Later on, he relocated to the metropolis to work at KFC Kota Kinabalu.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAlong with his two siblings, Syaiful formed the Zero group, which debuted on stage at the 2012 Gelanggang Awesome Raja Lawak. On 21 October 2012, their father died while sleeping. \nDespite their difficult circumstances, the three brothers were fortunate in 2013 to see an advertisement for Astro's reality comedy show Maharaja Lawak Mega (MLM) on television. The group's reputation swiftly increased after that, enabling them to participate in the MLM competition for four seasons, from 2012 to 2018. They also participated in the MLM in 2014 and took home the title in the reality TV competition. \nThey attempted again the next year but were unable to get to the finals. They took home half a million ringgit after winning the MLM 2014 championship. The Zero group's debut film, Lu Mafia Gua Gangster, was scheduled to premiere in Malaysia on 21 April 2016. \nSyaiful and Sharif teamed up in 2023 when they signed up for a reality show Family Duo season 3 (FD3). According to Sharif Kunal, he and his brothers had long-term plans to release a single under the Zero group name. The winnings might be used to write songs by the group. He also said that the music work has actually been planned for a long time—three or four years ago. The two brothers won the title of Best Duo during the first week of the competition, and surprised everyone by ending the fifth week with the highest score. Subsequently, they said that they will give the Palestinian Aid Tube any proceeds from the FD3's reality show.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nApart from enjoying themselves with their companions, they participated in other school competitions, such as those that involved religious singing (nasyid) and the playing of the kompang, a customary Malay musical instrument, which they still practice for their presentations.\nHis brother Sharif Kunal asserted that the brothers' lives haven't altered much since then and that they continue to live according to their same routines despite their success. Not everyone has it easy, he said, so the brothers utilize their money to assist their local friends and family. Not celebrity is what drives them. In actuality, they are able to perform what they do because of all of their assistance.\nOn 24 July 2015, Syaiful wed Ashura Rudy at Kampong Pantai Bahagia, Kudat. On 5 May 2016, their son, Mohamaad Sharif Isyraq, was born. On 23 December 2019, his wife gave birth to their daughter, Dayang Asyafia, and he was saddened that he was unable to be there. Although his wife is a Filipino citizen, the family has settled in Kudat despite Syaiful's intentions to reside in Kuala Lumpur.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nsyaiful_zero on Instagram",

        "content": "Mubarak (born Mubarak Merchant; 30 January 1909 – 26 July 1986) was an Indian film director and actor, who played character roles in Hindi cinema from early 1930s to mid 1970s.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMubarak was born in an affluent family of Bombay on 30 January 1909 and was fondly called \"Moby\" by his friends. Mubarak was the son of a construction engineer but was orphaned at a young age. He later grew up in a Parsi household. After attending St. Xavier Highschool and later St. Xavier College, he made his film debut with Pati Patni in 1929.\nA popular and respectable figure of the film industry, not much is known about his personal life. He quit career in the mid-1970s and breathed his last on 26 July 1986. He was 77.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMubarak started his career at the age of twenty with Chandulal Shah's Pati Patni. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Mubarak continued to appear in a string of films which included Vasal ki Raat (1930), Noor Jahan (1931), Sati Mahananda (1933) and Maharani (1934). The talkies brought newer opportunities for Mubarak when he learned the correct diction and fundamental tricks of voice control under the guidance of English actor and playwright Grant Anderson. A slew of box office successes followed for Mubarak, who, by the late forties, has been a part of films like Kangan, Naya Sansar, Kismet, Tansen (in which he portrayed Emperor Akbar), Zaban, Manorma, Tadbir and Shabnam.\nHis stately visage and regal bearing made him an apt choice to play Gangadhar Rao in Sohrab Modi's costume drama Jhansi Ki Rani. Later that year, he reprised his role of Akbar in the 1953 film Anarkali followed by Nagin which had him portraying a Nagi chieftain. Raj Kapoor starrer Phir Subha Hogi, Main Nashe Mein Hoon, Dev Anand's Maya, Jab Pyar Kisi Se Hota Hai, Yash Chopra's Waqt, B. R. Chopra's Humraaz are some of his memorable films. His last film appearance was in Shyam Benegal's film Nishant (1975) after which he left the film industry and retired.\n\n\n== Selected filmography ==\nMubarak appeared in more than a hundred films, some of which are listed below\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMubarak at IMDb",

She served for 39 years during which she was appointed to lead the Royal Police Force of Antigua and Barbuda in 2005.\n\n\n== Life ==\nChristopher was born in 1950 in Nut Grove in Saint John, Antigua and Barbuda. She went to Greenbay Primary School and attended the Moravian Church.\nShe was appointed to lead the Royal Police Force of Antigua and Barbuda in 2005. She was the first woman commissioner in the Caribbean. In the following year as part of the 2006 Birthday Honours, Christopher received the Queen's Police Medal in recognition of her service to the Royal Police Force of Antigua and Barbuda.\nIn 2008 she was sent on vacation leave and almost immediately a new commissioner Gary Nelson was appointed. Nelson was a Canadian and he was given the new job as a result of an inspection by another Canadian police officer, Alphonse Breau, in 2007. She retired having served the police for 39 years. Christopher's replacement's term ended in a court case. The police force belatedly tried to agree a contract with him in 2008 and when Gary Nelson refused the terms he was dismissed and the matter ended in court.\nChristopher died at her home in Gunthorpes in 2024. Her funeral in her Moravian church was attended by the police.  The leader of the opposition United Progressive Party sent a tribute noting her as a role model for other women to also break glass ceilings. A petition was raised to rename the street where the Police Headquarters is, American Road, after Delano Christopher.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Bukit Brown Cemetery, also known as the Bukit Brown Municipal Cemetery or the Bukit Brown Chinese Cemetery, was a cemetery in Singapore. It opened in 1922 and acted as a Chinese burial ground until its closure in 1973. Bukit Brown Cemetery is the largest Chinese cemetery outside of China and is also the location of many of Singapore's earliest pioneers.\n\n\n== History ==\nBukit Brown Cemetery was named after 19th-century British merchant George Henry Brown (1826–1882). He arrived in Singapore in the 1840s and lived here till his death after an accident in Penang on 5 October 1882.He had also purchased land on a hill which he called Mount Pleasant and built a cottage on it called Fern Cottage. As the land belonged to him, it was commonly referred to as Brown's Hill, translated locally to Bukit Brown.He sold the land to Mootapa Chitty and Lim Chu Yi who later sold the land to three Hokkien Ong clan members – Ong Hew Ko, Ong Ewe Hai, and Ong Chong Chew – who in the 1870s turned the land into a cemetery for Chinese people of the Ong clan with the surname, known as the Seh Ong Cemetery. All 3 of them were buried at Bukit Brown Cemetery after their deaths.In 1919, the government acquired the land after pressure had been put on them to open a municipal cemetery for the Chinese, despite the resistance from the Kongsi. It was then opened as Bukit Brown Municipal Cemetery on 1 January 1922. In 1923, the road leading up to Bukit Brown Cemetery was named Bukit Brown Road, also after Brown.Another road leading up to the cemetery was named Kheam Hock Road, after Tan Kheam Hock (1862–1922), a Singaporean politician.By 1929, 40% of Chinese deaths were buried at Bukit Brown Cemetery. It was closed in 1973 with about 100,000 graves. In 1965, the Public Works Department exhumed 237 graves to realign Lornie Road off Adam Road.From 2011 to 2012, after the area was designated for residential development, many activists were upset by this decision as Bukit Brown Cemetery was 'a distinctive slice of the multi-ethnic country's fast disappearing heritage.' This included exhuming 3700 graves to make space for an 8-lane highway.In 2012, it was originally announced by then-Minister of State for National Development Tan Chuan-Jin that 5000 graves would make way for a new 4-lane road that would cut through the cemetery. This number was later reduced to 3746 on 19 March 2012. It was also revealed that the rest of the cemetery would make way for a new public housing town in about 40 years time.The National Archives of Singapore (NAS) digitised and released the burial registers of the cemetery between April 1922 and December 1972 online, as well as a map of the cemetery to help descendants check if their ancestor's graves were affected by the development.In 2016, Bukit Brown Cemetery's gates, that were installed back in the 1920s, were removed from their original posts, cleaned and repaired, and reinstalled at the mouth of a new access road near its original location. In 2018, Bukit Brown Road was replaced by a section of the Lornie Highway.\n\n\n== Incidents ==\nIn 1927, two groups had a dispute and two Chinese men were found dead after being fatally stabbed. In 1933, two secret societies had a fight during a towkay's funeral where over 1000 people showed up. Six people were injured, including two children. In 1980, cemetery caretaker Pasiman bin Sadikan was found dead with his 15 years' of life savings stolen.\n\n\n== Notable burials ==\nTan Lark Sye (1897–1972), Singaporean businessman\nOng Boon Tat, founder of New World Amusement Park\nWi Peck Hay, the wife of Lim Nee Soon\nLim Chong Pang (1904–1956), Singaporean businessman and racehorse owner\nTan Kim Ching (1829–1892), Singaporean politician and businessman\nCheang Hong Lim (1825–1893), Chinese opium merchant and philanthropist\nTan Kheam Hock (1862–1922), Singaporean politician\nGan Eng Seng (1844–1899), Chinese philanthropist\nLee Choo Neo (1895–1947), Singapore physician\n\n\n== See also ==\nFormer cemeteries in Singapore\nBukit Brown MRT station, a Mass Rapid Transit station named after Bukit Brown Cemetery\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

He was a colleague and collaborator of Marcello Malphigi.\n\n\n== Life and work ==\nFracassati was born in Bologna in a family that came from Budrio. He joined university where his contemporaries included Marcello Malphigi, Giambattista Capponi and C. Golfieri. As a student of Bartolomeo Massari, he was part of a circle of nine anatomists called the \"chorus anatomicus\" who met regularly at the home of the professor. They conducted dissections and vivisection experiments on animals. One of the experiments they conducted was on the circulation of blood. These meetings ended when Massari died in 1655. He graduated in philosophy and medicine in 1656 and then taught logic for three years. He then taught medical theory at Bologna from 1659 and worked under the chair of surgery from 1660 and taught medical practice from 1662 to 1664. He published Hecatombe physioiatrica in 1656 and Praelectio medica in 1659. In 1663 he moved to Pisa but continued to work with colleagues in Bologna. At Pisa he worked with Giovanni Borelli, Lorenzo Bellini, Nicolas Steno and others. Among the work was on the papillary structures in the tongue involved in taste sensation. In 1670 he went to teach at the University of Messina where he died two years later.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiography (in Italian)",

        "earliest_creation_date": "2012-02-15 07:42:20",
        "content": "\"On the German Republic\" (German: Von deutscher Republik) is a work by Thomas Mann variously described as a lecture or an essay or a mixture of both forms which was first publicly delivered by its author on 13 October 1922 in the Berlin Beethoven Auditorium and subsequently published as a stand-alone work in 1923.\nThe work marked a turning point for Mann from criticism to support of the young Weimar Republic. The work has sometimes been noted as Mann's most famous speech.\n\n\n== Background ==\nMann delivered the speech after the assassination of Walther Rathenau, the German foreign minister, on 24 June 1922, which had shocked him. In a letter to his friend Ernst Bertram, he decried the \"darkness in the minds of these barbarians\" (Finsternis in den Köpfen dieser Barbaren). After the assassination he wanted to reason with the German youth – which he saw as very conservative and romantic – by making a speech in support of the republic around Gerhard Hauptmann's 60th birthday. Gerhard Hauptmann was a German writer, who had won the 1912 Nobel Prize in Literature, and was known as one of the first intellectual supporters of the new German republic.\nBy delivering this speech, Mann also wanted to distance himself from conservative-reactionary forces within Germany, which revered Mann for his 1918 Reflections of a Nonpolitical Man.\nPersonally, 1922 was important for Mann as he reconciled during this year with his brother Heinrich, whom he had previously viciously attacked in the Reflections. Mann read a draft of the speech to a circle of friends including Heinrich on 6 October 1922.\n\n\n== Lecture ==\n\nIn his earlier Reflections of a Nonpolitical Man (1918), Mann had defended German authoritarianism and the \"culture\" of Germany against the \"civilization\" of the West. After the establishment of the Weimar Republic, his speech \"On the German Republic\" marked a turning point for Mann as he now – at least in part – supported the young republic.\nThe work was publicly delivered by Mann on 13 October 1922 in the Berlin Beethoven Auditorium (Köthenerstraße 32) which was part of the old Philharmonic complex and has later been destroyed during World War II. Whether the work constitutes a lecture or an essay or a mixed form is debated by scholars.\nIn his lecture, Mann compares the seemingly antithetical writers Novalis – an 18th-century German romantic – and Walt Whitman – a 19th-century American \"poet of democracy\" and explains that they have more in common than one initially assumes.\nThe lecture heavily relies on quotations. The American academic Lawrence S. Rainey counts 75 quotations from 12 persons (Gerhart Hauptmann, Stefan George, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Nietzsche, Gustave Flaubert, Richard Wagner, Novalis, Walt Whitman, Adalbert Stifter, Dmitry Merezhkovsky, August von Platen-Hallermünde and Lothair I).\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Contemporary ===\nIn the contemporary conservative press, Mann was sharply attacked for his lecture. Das Gewissen (The Consciousness) wrote \"Mann overboard\" (Mann über Bord) and Der Tag (The Day) named him \"Saulus Mann\" (Saul Mann). Some authors in the liberal press were also sceptical. Das Tage-Buch (The Diary) noted that the speech was held in Berlin and not in Mann's adopted city of Munich where reactionary forces could have broken the windows his home for the speech. The paper called this \"well-considered bravery\" in an ironic tone.\n\n\n=== Mann family ===\nHis daughter Erika reflected positively on the work. In 1965 she wrote:\n\nWaves of insurrection and terror were sweeping the country. Democratic politicians had been shamefully assassinated, including the best among them, Walter Rathenau, whom Thomas Mann knew well. The German middle classes, unwilling to acknowledge the lost war's consequences as such, held the young Republic responsible for all the hardships. Thomas Mann's great essay, \"On the German Republic\" (1922), was his political recognition of the Republic in its hour of need and his most inopportune \"step\" since the Reflections. At this critical juncture its effect was startling, as if the author had thrown an incendiary bomb into his own house.\n\n\n=== Modern reception ===\nModern literary criticism has received the work in a positive light. Lawrence S. Rainey remarks that the work \"offers pleasures, both in content and form\" and that \"its complex affirmation of the Weimar Republic was indeed a brave and prescient step.\" He particularly praises the \"guarded affirmation of male love\", which showed \"a level of tolerance that was unusual for its time\" and was \"still valuable today.\"\nThe German academic Alexander Gallus has called the work \"perhaps [Mann's] most famous speech\".\n\n\n== Publication history and translation ==\nThe lecture was first published in volume 33 issue 11 of Die neue Rundschau on pages 1072–1106 (1922) with the title \"Thomas Mann for the German Republic\" (Thomas Mann für die deutsche Republik). In 1923, it was published as a standalone work with the now common German title \"Von deutscher Republik\". It is contained in the volume 15.1 of the Große kommentierte Frankfurter Ausgabe (2002) – the editio maior of Mann's works – on pages 514–559.\nThe work has been translated into English for the first time by Helen Tracy Lowe-Porter, albeit without the passages on homoeroticism, which Mann wanted to omit for an American readership. In 2007, a complete translation into English was provided by Lawrence S. Rainey for the academic journal Modernism/modernity.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n==== Primary sources ====\nMann, Thomas (2002) [1922]. \"Von deutscher Republik: Gerhard Hauptmann zum 60.

        "content": "Kagenouma Kōgoishi (鹿毛馬神籠石) was an ancient castle (also known as a Korean-style fortresses in Japan (朝鮮式山城, Chōsen-shiki yamajiro) located in the Kageuma neighborhood of the city of Iizuka, Fukuoka Prefecture Japan. Its ruins have been protected as a National Historic Site since 1945, with the area under protection expanded in 2002.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter the defeat of the combined Baekje and Yamato Japan forces, at the hands of the Silla and Tang China alliance at the Battle of Hakusukinoe in 663, the Yamato court feared an invasion from either or both Tang or Silla. In response, a huge network of shore fortifications was constructed throughout the rest of the 600s, often with the assistance of Baekje engineers, generals and artisans. Unaware of the outbreak of the Silla-Tang War (670–676), the Japanese would continue to build fortifications until 701, even after finding out that Silla was no longer friendly with Tang.\nThe Kagenouma Kōgoishi is located on a low horseshoe-shaped hill at an elevation of just under 80 meters facing the Kagema River, a tributary of the Onga River. There are rows of stones around the outside of the ridge, and the total length is 1980 meters. Approximately 1800 granite stones with a width of 40 to 80 centimeters were used. The stone rows are in relatively good preservation, but raise a number of questions. The height of the wall is low, and can easily be jumped over in combat, and there is no surviving evidence of the rammed-earth palisade which is found at other sites. The site includes the ruins of two water gates; however, unlike other sites, these water gates are small and are not protected by moats or stronger stone walls.  The date of construction for these ruins is also uncertain. They are estimated to date from the first half of the 7th century based solely on the shards of a Sue ware jat found in an archaeological excavation of the water gate ruins conducted from December 1983 to February 1984. \nThe site is approximately ten minutes by car from Kotake Station on the JR Kyushu Fukuhoku Yutaka Line\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\nList of foreign-style castles in Japan\nKōgoishi\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nDe Lange, William (2021).

        "content": "Ashikisan Castle (阿志岐山城跡, Ashikisan-jō ato) was an ancient castle (also known as a Korean-style fortresses in Japan (朝鮮式山城, Chōsen-shiki yamajiro) located in the Hakiho Ashiki neighborhood of the city of  Chikushino, Fukuoka Prefecture Japan. Its ruins have been protected as a National Historic Site since 2011. \n\n\n== History ==\nAfter the defeat of the combined Baekje and Yamato Japan forces, at the hands of the Silla and Tang China alliance at the Battle of Hakusukinoe in 663, the Yamato court feared an invasion from either or both Tang or Silla. In response, a huge network of shore fortifications was constructed throughout the rest of the 600s, often with the assistance of Baekje engineers, generals and artisans. Unaware of the outbreak of the Silla-Tang War (670–676), the Japanese would continue to build fortifications until 701, even after finding out that Silla was no longer friendly with Tang. The name \"kōgoishi\" means \"stones of divine protection,\" a name given them by the Meiji period archaeologist Tsuboi Shōgorō, who conjectured that they served as spiritual or practical protection for sacred sites. Scholars after Tsuboi determined that the structures are most likely the remains of practical, military fortifications, and were unlikely to have significant spiritual connections, although much remains unknown about these structures and there is very little contemporary documentary evidence.\nThe Ashikisan fortification is located approximately 5 kilometers east-southeast of Dazaifu, at the western foot of Miyajidake, 339 meters above sea level, to the east of the Ashiki Plain. Since its discovery in 1999, archaeological excavations have continued, and a 1340 meter long stone row with three water gates and an earthwork have been confirmed. When viewed from the plains, it can be seen that the entire mountain was used as a defensive facility, with rows of stones encircling the mountainside.  It is believed to be contemporary with the Kii Castle ruins. The site is approximately 16 minutes by car from Chikuzen-Yamae Station on the JR Kyushu Chikuhō Main Line.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\nList of foreign-style castles in Japan\nKōgoishi\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nDe Lange, William (2021).

        "content": "Ethan Read is a professional Australian rules footballer who was selected by the Gold Coast Suns with the ninth pick in the 2023 AFL draft.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nRead was raised on the Gold Coast where he attended St Andrews Lutheran College throughout his upbringing. He began playing junior football at nine years of age when signed up to play for the Palm Beach Currumbin Lions alongside future AFL teammates Jed Walter and Will Graham. Read joined the Gold Coast Suns Academy at 13 years of age, but was not considered a standout in his early teenage years.\nAt 16 years of age, Read experienced an 11 cm growth spurt and he was subsequently put on the radar of several AFL teams due to his newly developed 200 cm frame. The following year he received national exposure for the first time when as a bottom ager he was selected to represent the Allies several times in the U18 National Championships as well as the Gold Coast Suns Academy in the U19 Talent League. His performances at the representative and club levels led to Read being placed in the AFL's 30-player National Academy program on the eve of his draft year and he was generally considered a second round draft prospect at the time.\nRead moved into top 10 draft calculations when he played a starring role in the Allies' historic first U18 National Championship win and his performances earned him the starting ruckman position in the 2023 U18 All-Australian team. A month later he made his VFL debut for the Gold Coast and impressed many onlookers by quickly adjusting to the higher standard of football when he recorded 12 disposals, four scoring shots as well as multiple inside 50 marks in an impressive first game outing. His draft stock rose even more in mid-November when he finished second in the national combine 2km time trial by running a 5:56 and was rated as highly as the third best prospect in the 2023 draft pool by some recruiters. A week later, he was drafted to his hometown team the Gold Coast Suns with pick 9 in the 2023 AFL draft after the Suns elected to match a bid from the Geelong Cats. Read grew up supporting the Gold Coast Suns and described being drafted to the club with his friends as a \"dream come true\".\n\n\n== AFL career ==\nRead made his AFL debut for the Suns at 18 years of age in round 4 of the 2024 season against the Greater Western Sydney Giants in Mount Barker and kicked a goal in his first game.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEthan Read's profile on the official website of the Gold Coast Football Club",

A prominent feature of the Kermanshahi Persian dialect is the use of a number of Kurdish words and verbs, which can be seen in transformed and paid forms in the Kermanshahi Persian sentences. There are phonetic, lexical, and syntactic differences between Kermanshahi Persian and standard Persian, which arose due to the influence of Kermanshahi Kurdish. The Persian dialect of Kermanshah is considered the most western dialect of the Persian language.\n\n\n== References ==",

The battalion has a long history with the Ordnance QF 25-pounder and the M7 Priest. With the Israel Defense Force's equipping itself in the early 1970s with M-107 self-propelled guns, the battalion underwent a reorganization. The name of the battalion was changed to 647.\n\n\n=== Yom Kippur War ===\nAt the start of the Yom Kippur War, the battalion was a reserve force under the command of Lt. Col. Aryeh Zinger, and the deputy commander of the battalion was Major Eitan Motes.\n\nThe battalion was sent to the Egyptian front and joined the 209th Artillery Brigade under the command of Yaakov Erez. The battalion was part of the order of battle of the 252nd Division. With the beginning of the fighting, the battalion commanders - the generals and the battery commanders were assigned and transferred to support positions at the various levels in the fighting units as usual. The actual command in the fighting was of the Deputy Battalion Commander and the Artillery Position Officers.\nThe battalion was equipped at the Tzrifin camp, where the soldiers were given equipment from an emergency storage unit of a battalion of towed cannons. The soldiers were taken by bus to Rafidim Air Base and received the M-107s of the 55th battalion. From Rafidim the Battalion went to the Mitla Pass.\nFrom Sunday night, October 7, the battalion was stationed in the Mitla Pass area. The main mission of the battalion was to provide assistance to the Dock Post which was attacked by the Egyptian commandos. The shooting was directed by the commanders of the posts Egyptian forces approaching the posts. This operation lasted several days and included massive firing of hundreds of shells.\nOn October 11, the battalion assisted the operation of the Shayetet 13 in the Ardaka anchorage on Green Island. Battery C moved dozens of kilometers south to get within firing range of the island. During the night the cannons fired heavy fire on the Egyptian forces that were on the island.\nAt the same time, a response was given to requests for assistance in armor battles, and in assisting the defensive battle conducted by the division's forces against the Egyptian forces who were trying to continue advancing towards the east. In the Battle of the Sinai, the battalion assisted the armored forces and attacked the Egyptian forces.\nIn Operation Abirey-Halev, a praise was given to the 647th Battalion due to the advantage of the range of the M-107 self-propelled guns (up to 33 kilometers) intended to hit the SA-2, SA-3, and SA-6 surface-to-air missile bases. On October 18, the light vehicles and guns crossed the canal on motorized barges.\nThe deployment of the battalion's batteries in the West Bank was in \"York 1\", an agricultural area with corn fields. The artillery position was placed relatively close to the \"Yard\". Beginning on the morning of October 17, the Egyptian army began shelling the \"Yard\" and the western bank adjacent to it with artillery and Katyushas in order to disrupt the activity there. Egyptian aircrafts also began to attack the area.\nThe battalion's batteries began massive fire at targets deep in Egypt in order to disrupt the activity of the SA-2, SA-3, and SA-6 missile launch bases. At the same time there were constant warnings about the fear of the Egyptians hitting the battalion's batteries. On the night of October 19, the battery was attacked by a Katyusha, but without injury or damage.\nOn the morning of October 20, another volley of Katyushas was fired and hit the battery. The ammunition caterpillars were ignited and exploded. Five of the battery's soldiers were killed, including Danny Bernheim, commander of the battery, and 40 were wounded.\nAfter the ceasefire, the battalion's batteries were deployed in the Ismailia sands until February 21, 1974. On this date, the Israel Defense Force withdrawn from the areas west of the canal. The 647th artillery battalion was the last artillery battalion to cross the bridge back to Sinai. The battalion was finally let go in March 1974.\n\n\n== Brigade Commanders ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Thunderbolt is a 1905 Australian play about the bushranger Captain Thunderbolt, based on the book Three Years with Thunderbolt by William Monckton.\nMonckton's narrative was serialised in The Argus newspaper. It was popular and was adapted by Ambrose Pratt and A. Joseph for the stage in 1905.\nProducer William Anderson said \"This production is absolutely Australian. It has been written by Australian playwrights. The characters are Australian notabilities. The scenery has been painted by Australian painters. It will be acted by Australian artists, and played before Australian audiences. Advance Australia!\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Bulletin said \"the house most obviously liked it. No howling London  melodrama of the last two Anderson seasons  has been better received. As a piece of  entertainment it answered its purpose. The Andersonian audience wants plenty of action,  and “Thunderbolt” supplies that... You get an evening of Thunderbolt with  an interesting and reasonably sober plot thrown in, and a menagerie of wallabies, kookaburras,  mail coaches, and cockatoos to add more local color to Reg Robins’ New England (N.S.W.) scenery.\"\nThe Evening News said \"Thunderbolt was imaginatively drawn, his opinions and his method of moralising being struck in too intellectual a key. \"\nThe Sydney Morning Herald said \"In the plot, Thunderbolt...is depicted as an outlaw who robs the rich but spares the poor, and who, indeed, generously assists the latter from funds nefariously\nacquired from other people. He has a high opinion of his own virtue, and mentions the fact in verbose language, couched in terms refined enough to make the wallabies in his vicinity sit up with admiration, and subdue the desire of the kookaburras to laugh as they listen to his glowing rhetoric.\"\nThe Age called it \"a good, honest and thoroughly workmanlike melodrama on more or less\nconventional lines, in which a sentimental interest is handled judiciously and the sensational element plays a smaller part than in many of Mr. Anderson's imported pieces. There are several admirably planned situations and tableaus, a story that runs evenly and plausibly, a really\nhumorous comic relief, and above all things an application of local\" color to the scenes and a local idiom to the dialogue which make a direct and immediate appeal to an Australian audience.\"\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe play was structured as follows:\n\nAct. 1: Scene 1 – Kurrajong Station. Thunderbolt Takes a Hand. The Arrival of the Police.\nAct. 2: Scene 1 – M'Guire's Pub; Scene 2. – Bar Parlour; Scene 3. – Verandah of M'Guire's Pub (By Night).\nAct. 3: Scene 1. – M'Guire's Half-way House; Scene 2. – Bedroom in M'Guire's Hotel; Scene 3. – In the Bush; Scene 4. – Poison Gap – The Coach Stuck Up – The Chase – Thunderbolt's Daring Leap for Life.\nAct. 4: Scene 1. – Squatter Mason's Drawing-room; Scene 2. – The Bedchamber; Scene 3. – Barroom of M'Guire's Half-way House; Scene 4. – In the Bush; Scene 5. – Squatter Mason's Station — Thunderbolt's Sacrifice; Scene 6. – In the Bush; Scene 7. – The River Bank, Kurrajong – Farewell to the Outlaw.\nThe play was produced by William Anderson and starred Eugenie Duggan.\n\n\n== 1905 Cast ==\nCast of the orginal production:\n\nLaurence Dunbar as Fred Ward (alias Capt. Thunderbolt)\nStiling Whyte as Alexander Mason\nGeorge Cross as Jack Mason\nBert Bailey as the Hon. Algernon Chetwood\nEdmund Duggan as Michael McGuIre\nEdwin Campbell as Trooper Denis O'Malley\nPercy Goodwin as Trooper Smith\nFrank Rossmore as Inspector Hare\nIH Nunn as Patrick O'Sullivan\nWIllie McGuire as Temple Harrison\nHarold Forbes as Walter Dalgleish\nPeter Smith as J. L. Lawrence\nBully Evans as Max Clifto\nHarvey Wilton as Bully Evans\nRoy Willmot as Old Ned\nEugenie Duggan as Maude Maren\n\n\n== 1910 cast ==\nA cast list from a 1910 production was:\n\nGeorge Cross as Fred Ward (alias Captain Thunderbolt)\nAlf Scarlett as Mr. Alexander Mason (Owner of Kurrajong Station)\nMax Clifton as Jack Mason (his son)\nRutland Beckett as Geoffrey Marrow, J. P. (bank manager)\nBert Bailey as The Hon. Algernon Chetwynd (Jackeroo)\nJ.H. Nunn as Michael M'Guire\nEdmund Duggan as Trooper Denis O'Malley (mounted police)\nHarry Reacy as Trooper Smith (mounted police)\nFrank Rossmore as Inspector Hare (police inspector)\nCarleton Stuart as Patrick O'Sullivan (a bullock driver)\nGeorge McKenzie as Morgan (bushranger)\nOlive Wilton as Maude Mason (daughter of squatter Mason)\nEugenie Duggan as Sunday\n\n\n== Film adaptation ==\nThe play was turned into the 1910 film Thunderbolt.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThunderbolt (play) at AustLit\nThunderbolt at Ausstage",

        "content": "John Darcy, Lord Conyers (1659 – 6 January 1689) was an English soldier and one of the two members of the House of Commons of England representing Richmond, Yorkshire, briefly in 1681 and again from 1685 to 1687.\nThe eldest son of Conyers Darcy, Lord Darcy de Knayth, and Lady Frances Howard, a daughter of Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Berkshire, Darcy was known by the courtesy title of Lord Conyers during the later life of his grandfather Conyers Darcy, 1st Earl of Holderness, who died on 14 June 1689 aged ninety.\nWhen he was fifteen, Conyers abducted and married Bridget Sutton, the eldest daughter of Robert Sutton, 1st Baron Lexinton. She was aged only ten. They later had five sons, including Robert Darcy, 3rd Earl of Holderness, and Conyers Darcy, and two daughters.\nConyers studied law at Gray's Inn. He was first elected to parliament at the election of 1681, serving in the brief Oxford Parliament of 1681. Due to the Exclusion Bill, King Charles II then ruled without parliament until his death in February 1685. In that year, Conyers was elected again to what became known as the Loyal Parliament, the only one summoned by James II. That sat until 1687, and in its second session Conyers joined the opposition to the king.\nBetween 1681 and 1685, Conyers held a major's commission in the Queen's Life Guards. In July 1685 he became lieutenant-colonel of the Earl of Shrewsbury's Horse, raised in response to the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685.\nIn 1688, Conyers brought about a reconciliation between Lord Danby and the Earl of Devonshire, laying the foundations of that year's rising against the king in the north of England. Unsuspected as a rebel, he was ordered to arrest his fellow-conspirator Lord Lumley, one of the men who had signed the invitation to William of Orange to invade England and instigate the Glorious Revolution. Conyers claimed he could not find Lumley. On 22 November 1688, he took part in Danby's seizure of the city of York for William and was expected to join Danby's Tories in the Convention Parliament.\nConyers died of quinsy on 6 January 1689, but four days later at the general election of 1689 he was returned again for Richmond. He was buried in Westminster Abbey. At a subsequent by-election, in February, he was succeeded by his brother Philip Darcy, who had just lost his seat at Newark.\n\n\n== Notes ==",

        "content": "Hagi Kōgoishi (杷木神籠石) was an ancient castle (also known as a Korean-style fortresses in Japan (朝鮮式山城, Chōsen-shiki yamajiro) located in the Hakihosaka and Hakihayashida neighborhoods of the city of Asakura, Fukuoka Prefecture Japan. Its ruins have been protected as a National Historic Site since 1972. \n\n\n== History ==\nAfter the defeat of the combined Baekje and Yamato Japan forces, at the hands of the Silla and Tang China alliance at the Battle of Hakusukinoe in 663, the Yamato court feared an invasion from either or both Tang or Silla. In response, a huge network of shore fortifications was constructed throughout the rest of the 600s, often with the assistance of Baekje engineers, generals and artisans. Unaware of the outbreak of the Silla-Tang War (670–676), the Japanese would continue to build fortifications until 701, even after finding out that Silla was no longer friendly with Tang. The name \"kōgoishi\" means \"stones of divine protection,\" a name given them by the Meiji period archaeologist Tsuboi Shōgorō, who conjectured that they served as spiritual or practical protection for sacred sites. Scholars after Tsuboi determined that the structures are most likely the remains of practical, military fortifications, and were unlikely to have significant spiritual connections, although much remains unknown about these structures and there is very little contemporary documentary evidence.\nThe Hagi Kōgoishi is located on the easternmost tip of the Chikugo Plain on the north bank of the Chikugo River. It encloses a hill whose highest point is 192 meters above sea level. In the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, the Asakura area is said to have been the location of a palace occupied by Empress Saimei. After the fall of Baekje in 660 Baekje loyalists fled to Japan to ask for help in the revival of the kingdom. In May 661, Empress Saimei arrived at the Asakura Palace intending to lead a military expedition to Korea; however, the death of the empress at Asakura thwarted those plans before the army departed. If this account is historically accurate, Asakura was an important location from a transportation and military standpoint, and its is possible that her temporary palace was located within the Hagi Kōgoishi.\nThe site was discovered during construction work in 1967, and was the ninth kōgoishi to have been identified. The stone wall was built along the ridge line of the mountain, encompassing two valleys, and is oval in shape with a major axis of about 800 meters and a short axis of about 400 meters. The total length of the stone wall is approximately 2250 meters. All of the stones used are andesitic volcanic rocks, which are found widely distributed throughout the area. Although many parts of the earthworks were washed away, it is estimated that they were over four meters deep.There are water gates between the two valleys that open toward the west. \nThe site is located in front of the Hamasaki housing complex on Japan National Route 386 and is approximately 1.5 kilometers from Chikugo-Ōishi Station on the JR Kyushu Kyūdai Main Line.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\nList of foreign-style castles in Japan\nKōgoishi\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nDe Lange, William (2021).

It comprised eight villages: Aciliu, Amlaș (the area's center, now called Amnaș), Cacova (now Fântânele), Galeș, Săliște, Sibiel, Tilișca and Vale.\nȚara Amlașului was included in Mircea the Elder's lengthy title mentioning all the possessions over which he held control. The title described him as the herțeg or duke of the territory.

        "content": "The Bangkok Marriott Hotel The Surawongse (Thai: โรงแรม แบงค็อก แมริออท เดอะ สุรวงศ์) is a hotel in Bangkok, Thailand, that is part of the Marriott Hotels & Resorts brand. Owned by Asset World Corporation, the five-star hotel opened in 2018. The 32-floor building has 197 rooms and 106 suites. For hosting events, the hotel has two reception venues and 14 banquet spaces. The hotel has an infinity pool, a gym, and a spa.\nThe Surawongse has two restaurants and a bar. The third-floor Praya Kitchen, a buffet with Thai cuisine as the focal point, serves western dishes, sushi, and seafood. The 32nd-floor Yào Restaurant serves Shanghai cuisine, dim sum, and Cantonese delicacies. The 33rd-floor Yào Rooftop Bar serves Chinese snacks, bar food, and Chinese-inspired cocktails. The hotel has two lounges: the M Club Lounge is for customers staying in certain suites, while the Lobby Lounge serves tea.\n\n\n== History ==\nBuilt in 1957, the Surawongse House influenced the design of Bangkok Marriott Hotel The Surawongse, specifically in the hotel's rooms, lobby, and common area. The hotel showcases various types of art pieces including textiles, murals, and sculptures from Khīan Yimsiri The Surawongse commenced operations on 3 April 2018. The 32-story hotel is a five-star hotel. The Surawongse in 2019 hosted \"Michelin Star Revelation Thailand\", an event during which the Michelin Guide announced which restaurants would be granted stars. The hotel's owner is Asset World Corporation (AWC). Alongside five other AWC hotels, it was temporarily shuttered for a period in 2020 owing to the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand.\n\n\n== Location ==\nLocated in a low-key area of downtown Bangkok on Surawong Road, The Surawongse is situated opposite the Neilson Hays Library and the British Club. It is near the business districts of Sathon and Si Lom. It is midway between Sukhumvit Road, a busy road, and Chao Phraya River's historical attractions. Cultural landmarks near the hotel are the Bangkok Folk Museum, the Sri Maha Mariamman Temple, and Charoen Krung Soi 32's street art. Customers can ask for and receive from the hotel a small map showing key attractions in the area. The Surawongse provides customers transportation via van to the Sala Daeng BTS station, which is a 15-minute walk from the hotel. The Surawongse is a 40-minute taxi ride away from both of Bangkok's international airports, Don Mueang International Airport and Suvarnabhumi Airport.\n\n\n== Amenities ==\n\n\n=== Guest rooms ===\nThere are 197 rooms and 106 suites that are designed like apartments. It has accessible rooms modified to accommodate disabled guests. The Surawongse's rooms have windows that span from the ceiling to the floor. They are decorated with bronze sculptures and glass panels ornamented with village settings. The walls of the rooms and the doors of the glass showers feature traditional Thai art. Each restroom has marble finishes and is equipped with a shower with rain shower heads and a bathtub. The hotel's suites are between one and three bedrooms. Each suite has a sitting space surrounding a circular table, a walk-in closet, a washing machine, and a tiny kitchen. The one-bedroom suites are sufficient for one or two people, while the larger suites are suitable for families. Tom Vater of The Daily Telegraph found the rooms to be too tight but praised the furniture, saying it was \"in top condition, a little understated, minimalistic and quietly luxurious, making for an adult hotel experience\". Lifestyle Asia reviewer Pearl Yan praised the room design, writing, \"Wooden floors and earth-toned furniture are in harmony with the white ceiling and light-coloured pieces, creating open, airy spaces that are calming, uncluttered and filled with natural light.\"\n\n\n=== Restaurants and bar ===\nThe Surawongse has two restaurants: Praya Kitchen, a buffet that primarily serves Thai cuisine, and Yào Restaurant, a venue that serves Shanghai and Cantonese cuisine. The hotel's Yào Rooftop Bar serves cocktails featuring Chinese influences and Chinese appetizer dishes.\n\n\n==== Praya Kitchen ====\n\nThe third-floor Praya Kitchen is a buffet that serves lunch and dinner. The name alludes to Chao Phraya River and evokes \"senior Thai societal rank\". With Thai cuisine as the focal point, it offers Thai street food and also serves sushi, western comfort food, and desserts. The restaurant's founding chef, Attapol \"X\" Naito Thangthong, relied on his grandmother's recipes to make the Thai dishes. Praya Kitchen serves dishes from the four Thai regions: northern, north-eastern, central, and southern. The restaurant has \"more recent-but-forgotten kitsch classics\" such as \"Gai Ob Phu Kao Fai\", which means \"Chicken Volcano\". Drenched in Mekhong whiskey, a rotisserie chicken is shown on the table in a scene that BK Magazine critic Kankanok Wichiantanon said hearkens back to \"Thai fine dining of yesteryear\". Khanom chin gaeng kua, another classic Thai dish, has rice noodles, fish curry, and Maine lobsters.\nPraya Kitchen has areas where customers can bring seafood, vegetable, and meat dishes to be cooked in front of them in a sizzling wok. The restaurant's seafood offerings consist of scallops from Hokkaido, mussels, oysters, crabs, rock lobsters, and tiger prawns. Its meat options include \"dry-aged Thai sirloin, Kurobuta pork, and New Zealand lamb\". The Bangkok Post's Vanniya Sriangura opined that the most premium seafood selection was the river prawn, while the most premium meat selection was the Australian wagyu rib eye steak. She said the high demand caused both to be rapidly depleted. The restaurant's western dishes include foie gras and lobster bisque, which Sriangura praised. Dishes from Yào Restaurant, another hotel eatery, are featured in Praya Kitchen. Sriangura lauded the xiao long bao and Peking duck dishes but criticised the barbecued pork for being excessively sweet and missing the scorched smell. The Daily Telegraph's Tom Vater praised three dishes: pandanus leaf-wrapped chicken; som tam, a papaya salad dish; and mango cheesecake.\nThe restaurant's cocktails use Thai fruits. Examples are the \"Asia Pacific Cooler\", a vodka drink containing jasmine water blended with lychee purée and liqueur, and the \"Pa-N Da-N\", an unaged cachaça drink containing a mixture of honey, coconut, and pineapple. As to its decor, the restaurant features immense murals depicting the traditional Thai way of living in the royal court and in the country. Made of wood, the works are reproductions sourced from religious stories told in temple murals. Wichiantanon, the BK Magazine reviewer, said the murals \"lend the vast open space a genuine sense of occasion\" and praised the \"easy-flowing music\" the restaurant put on. Sriangura, the Bangkok Post reviewer, praised the restaurant's design of grouping the primary food stations in the venue's centre, which allowed customers to efficiently access the food.\n\n\n==== Yào Restaurant ====\n\nThe 32nd-floor Yào Restaurant serves Shanghai cuisine, dim sum, and Cantonese delicacies. In Mandarin, Yào (Chinese: 耀) means \"glory\". The name is showcased through the brass sculptures and intricate Chinese adornments. Yào's furnishings follow \"chang sip mo\", a Thai concept meaning \"traditional craftsmanship\". Examples are elaborate pagodas and works of art that mimic Henry Moore. The restaurant evokes Shanghai in the 1930s through its polished metalwork architecture. Through furnishings in dim and alluring shades, it is influenced by present-day Shanghai. Noel Maclean of the Bangkok Post said there are \"vivid Shanghainese art deco influences\" including the \"bulbous teardrop chandeliers\" and the ceramics imprinted with koi as well as napkins styled into wave formations. Maclean concluded, \"The overall ambiance is that of internet age-updated halcyon-era Shanghai chic\". Additional Chinese decorations are folding screens and hand-held fans. Yào has five rooms where guests can dine in private. The largest room has a 20-person occupancy. Yào offers Chinese fortune sticks for customers to try to select which tea to drink in a custom the restaurant named \"des-tea-ny\".\nChinese chefs oversee the cooks who prepare the food in the restaurant's kitchen. Yào serves a breakfast buffet with Asian food like congee and English breakfast options in conjunction with cereal, fruit, juice, lunch meat, and cheese. The dim sum lunch includes har gow and siu mai, which Time Out reviewer Phavitch Theeraphong called \"tasty and sizeable\". Another dim sum dish, xiaolongbao, is served in both the usual steamed way as well as in a fried way. According to Theeraphong, the fried xiaolongbao is a Shanghainese delicacy that is uncommon and difficult to find in other places and is perfectly complemented by Yào's housemade chili sauce. The Bangkok Post critic Noel Maclean lauded the dim sum dishes to be \"outstanding for their size, firmness and crystal clear flavours\". For the afternoon tea, the restaurant serves both savory dishes and desserts. The savory dishes include turnip cake that is pan fried and drenched in XO Sauce, xiao long bao, shrimp siu mai, cheese dumplings that are deep fried and contain crab, fish dumplings that are pan fried and contain green chives, and sake soy sauce-drenched baby abalone. The desserts include bird nest, custard puff pastry, macaron made of jujube, and sago containing cantaloupe and coconut milk.\nThe dinner dishes include a dish with fried green beans and tofu; Chinese bites; and lobster drenched in XO sauce made of prawn and oolong. Theeraphong said of the restaurant, \"Yao may not wow you with eye-popping, elaborately presented dishes, but it does offer everything you would want for a decent Chinese meal.\" Lifestyle Asia critic Pearl Yan praised three dishes: mushroom soup containing tofu in the form of a flower, \"steamed pork dumpling in oolong tea soup\"; and hand-pulled noodles. When customers choose the hand-pulled noodles, the chef arrives in front of them to demonstrate the noodle pulling.\n\n\n==== Yào Rooftop Bar ====\nThe 33rd floor Yào Rooftop Bar seats 160 people and occupies two floors. It gives customers a panoramic view of their surroundings as they do al fresco dining. Yào Rooftop Bar makes use of numerous glass screens so the view is unobstructed. Visitors can see the Chao Phraya River, tower blocks, and Old Town. The Bangkok Post reviewer Noel Maclean described the bar as \"two-tier, multi-level rock garden-like\". The bar has a nostalgic Chinese style and its design is heavily shaped by contemporary Shanghainese style. The venue has circular tables adorned with flame-free candles and miniature orange trees, as well as chairs containing frames etched in the Chinese style. Evoking a roof garden, it has numerous potted plants placed around the venue. The bar largely plays contemporary Chinese music and periodically plays traditional tunes.\nThe bar's food and drinks are prepared by Yào Restaurant. It has Chinese snacks, bar food, and Chinese-inspired cocktails. The cocktail \"Shanghai, City Upon Sea\", is a dark purple drink containing butterfly pea flower, which is the source of the drink's colour. The purple colour honours the Shanghai TV tower Oriental Pearl Tower, which is bathed in a purple hue after dark. The \"Chinese Highball\" is a \"punchy and potent\" cocktail made with mango and bourbon, while the Shanghai Swings is a cocktail with a banana taste. The bar's menu has tinier food items than the Yào restaurant. It serves a gravy-drenched noodle dish containing spicy minced pork. Another dish is fried chicken made in the Sichuan way, which has a blend of \"sweet, salty, hot and sour\" flavours.\n\n\n=== Lounges ===\nThe hotel has two lounges: the M Club Lounge and the Lobby Lounge. The M Club Lounge is available for only residents of four suite types: one-bedroom, Executive, Vice Presidential, and Presidential. It serves a small breakfast buffet containing cereal, fruit, hot plates, and à la carte selections. In the evening, it offers canapé and cocktails. Lifestyle Asia critic Pearl Yan lauded the lounge's design, calling it \"a gorgeously decked-out space\" replete with \"stylish seating and lush carpets\". The ground floor Lobby Lounge offers two kinds of tea options in the afternoon: traditional Thai and Western. Yan, the Lifestyle Asia reviewer, found the tea selections to be \"scrumptious and visually appealing\". She praised the lounge's decor for \"espous[ing] refinement and timeless luxury over modern Thai-inspired design\".\n\n\n=== Facilities ===\nThe Surawongse has a tiny infinity pool and a gym that is open around the clock. Tom Vater of The Daily Telegraph said the gym was large and gave customers an excellent view of the surroundings. Named the Quan Spa, the hotel's spa uses traditional Thai techniques to attend to customers. Designed to ease muscle tension and make people feel better, one spa option is Muay Thai-themed. There are four \"treatment rooms\" in the spa, of which one fits two people. The hotel has a club for children, though there is no staff supervision for the area. There is a children's pool that is connected to the larger pool.\nThe hotel allocated 1,555 square metres (0.000600 sq mi) to hosting events. A 1,155-square-metre (0.000446 sq mi) part of the hotel has two reception venues, 14 banquet spaces, and an exterior courtyard.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nZhao, Siyu 趙思語; Meng, Jinlan 蒙金蘭 (2023). 曼谷攻略完全制霸2023–2024 [Bangkok Strategy to Complete Dominance 2023–2024] (in Chinese).

        "content": "Panagia Nafpaktiotissa also known as Panagia tis Nafpaktos or Madonna di Lepanto is an icon of the Virgin Mary and a temple closely connected with the history of Nafpaktos, possibly as early as the 5th century AD.\n\n\n== The Palermo Parchment ==\nThe case of the Virgin of Nafpaktos is inextricably linked to the historical Byzantine parchment kept in Palermo, Sicily, specifically in the archive of the Regia Cappella Palatina (State Museum of the Palace Chapel). This parchment is a copy of the charter of a religious brotherhood of the 10th century, which was active in the region of Thebes and whose center of honor and worship was the icon of the \"Most Holy Theotokos of Nafpaktitis\" which was kept in the Monastery of Nafpaktitis. The parchment was probably found in Palermo after and because of the Norman raid on the city of Thebes in 1147.  \n\n\n== The religious Brotherhood of Panagia Nafpaktiotissa ==\nAccording to the testimony of the charter, the brotherhood was founded in 1048 AD. The statute is signed by 19 clergy and 30 lay people, including women. The purposes of the fraternity are primarily spiritual in nature. The form and honor of the Virgin and her icon dominates. Every month the Virgin visited the homes of the members and was honored with sacred rituals. The brotherhood also dedicated its prayers to the health of its members and to their general good condition here and beyond the grave.\n\n\n== The picture ==\nAt her head, the parchment bears a miniature of the Virgin Mary standing on a marble floor and wearing a blue mantle and a purple tunic. Panagia is in prayer position. The specific iconographic type of the Virgin Mary was established from the middle of the 1st century. In all probability, this particular miniature is a copy of the icon of the Virgin of Nafpaktiotissa which was either brought to Thebes from Nafpaktos, or was a copy of the original. However, the cult of this particular image so far from its headquarters is evidence of its widespread honor.\n\n\n== The temple and worship of Panagia in Nafpaktos ==\nThe temple probably dates from the 5th century. This pilgrimage was famous during the years of the Byzantine Empire and the Frankish rule and enjoyed privileges and donations from kings and emperors as the learned Metropolitan of Nafpaktos Ioannis Apokaykos (1217 AD) saves us. Among them are the emperors Alexios I Komnenos (1081-1118) and Michael I Komnenos (1143-1180). In Chrysoboulos of Theodoros Angelos Komnenos Doukas, Despot of Epirus, issued in May 1228, at the request of Apokaukos, his decision to help the metropolitan temple of Nafpaktos as a dedication to the city's patroness Theotokos is mentioned.\n\n\n== The Virgin Mary of Nafpaktos and the historical Naval Battle of Nafpaktos ==\nWhen the time came for the infamous Naval Battle of Nafpaktos, Pope Pius V ordered for the first time the use of the rosary with the request to the Virgin Mary to bring victory to the allied Christians against the Turks, who until then were invincible in sea. When victory unexpectedly came, it was attributed to the intervention of the Virgin Mary. Our Lady of Nafpaktos has since been called Santa Maria del Rozario or Madonna di Lepanto del Rozario in the West. The Pope designated October 7 as a feast day for the Virgin Mary of Nafpaktos for the entire Christian West. The Battle of Nafpaktos inspired many artists including the great Tisianos, Vicentinos and Domenikos Theotokopoulos. In many similar paintings, the Virgin Mary is depicted blessing and giving victory to Christians. Piemonte Chilardi wrote that, not the valor, nor the weapons, nor the leaders, but the Virgin gave the victory. The Venetian Republic wrote the same in the Palazzo Ducale: Non virtus, non arma, non duces, sed Maria Rozarii vit ores nos feces. \n\n\n== Citations ==",

        "content": "The Te Pōrere Redoubts were fortifications of the New Zealand Wars, located at Te Pōrere, to the southwest of the current site of Tūrangi, in New Zealand. They were built by the Māori warrior Te Kooti and his Ringatū followers in September 1869. They were the site of the Battle of Te Pōrere, between Te Kooti's forces and those of the New Zealand colonial government's Armed Constabulary and Māori aligned with the government—known as kūpapa. The site of the redoubts, which were restored after it was designated as a National Historic Place in February 1961, is administered by Heritage New Zealand.\n\n\n== History ==\nTe Kooti's War, one of the conflicts of the New Zealand Wars, spanned the period from July 1868 to May 1872. It involved Te Kooti, the Māori leader of a religion called Ringatū, and several of his followers who had escaped to mainland New Zealand from imprisonment on the Chatham Islands in July 1868. Pursued by local militia, he raided Matawhero and instigated a massacre of local Māori and settlers. Engagements with the government's Armed Constabulary and kūpapa—allied Māori—followed and Te Kooti's forces suffered a major defeat at Ngātapa in January 1869. They subsequently fled to the Urewera ranges. He perpetuated further raids on the civilian population and with government forces still after him, Te Kooti and his followers gradually moved to the Central Plateau.\nTe Kooti ambushed a party of Armed Constabulary near Lake Taupō in June and the government began to move troops to the area. Te Kooti skirmished with kūpapa in September in an attempt to disrupt the build up but his efforts were relatively ineffective. The redoubts at Te Pōrere were constructed later in the month, most likely by Te Kooti and his followers. Alternatively, it is possible that they were constructed by the local tribe, Ngāti Tūwharetoa. In the Battle of Te Pōrere, government forces attacked Te Pōrere on 4 October, inflicting a major defeat on Te Kooti. While Te Kooti, who was wounded in the hand in the fighting, was able to escape, 37 of his followers were killed. Their bodies were buried in the main fortification at Te Pōrere.\n\n\n== Description ==\nTe Pōrere is a locality situated about 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) to the west of Lake Rotoaira and southwest of the current site of the town of Tūrangi. The defensive works there were consisted of three distinct fortifications: the main pā (hillfort), also known as the 'upper redoubt', the 'lower redoubt', which was actually a series of trenches, and a rifle pit.\n\n\n=== Upper redoubt ===\n\nThe main pā was built in the style of a redoubt, as commonly used by the British Army during the New Zealand Wars. A redoubt is a type of fortification which, since it did not require timber elements, could be constructed relatively quickly by troops in the field. Usually taking a square or rectangular plan form, they were prepared by excavating a ditch to define the perimeter of the redoubt. The dug out earth was piled up on the inner side of the ditch to form a parapet.\nThe upper redoubt was built on an elevated site with its western side close to the bush line. The east side faced a swampy plain leading towards Rotoaira Lake. It is about 20 metres (66 ft) square with bastions extending from the northwest and southeast corners. At the time of the battle, the earthen walls ranged from just under 2 metres (6.6 ft) to about 3 metres (9.8 ft). A ditch surrounded a substantial portion of the walls, most noticeably about the portions lowest in height. The bastions in theory offered defenders the ability to fire down onto the ditch but in practice were poorly angled. Loop holes were provided at regular intervals along the wall. The main entrance/exit point, which coincided with a break in the ditch, was midway along the western wall which, due to its proximity to the bush, offered a line of escape for its occupants. A major flaw in the redoubt was the construction of the loop holes; these lacked any declination such that the defenders needed to fire their weapons over the top of the parapet when shooting at attackers sheltering in the ditches.\nA low wall, running along a west–east axis, separated a large portion of the interior of the upper redoubt into two distinct halves. This wall is unlikely to have fulfilled a defensive function and may have been used to separate the defenders; Te Kooti and his followers from the East Cape in one half, while the local Tūwharetoa who had joined Te Kooti since his arrival in the area in the other half.\n\n\n=== Lower redoubt ===\n\nThe lower redoubt, located to the east of the upper redoubt, is positioned on a knoll on the west or left bank of a stream which flowed from the western side of Tongariro mountain to the Whanganui River. This was a complex of several trenches and while providing cover nearly all round, the position lacked depth and had a limited field of view.\n\n\n=== Rifle pit ===\nThe rifle pit, southeast of the lower redoubt, was located on the east or right bank of the Wanganui River; some distance to the southeast from the main redoubt, it may have served as an observation post. The main portion was about five feet deep, with a wall thrown up on its eastern front for protection.\n\n\n== Site ==\n\nTe Pōrere was abandoned after the battle but remained in generally good condition although with some growth of vegetation along the walls over time. The historian James Cowan, writing in 1923 described the fortifications as being in a \"fair state of preservation\". The land on which the battle took placed remained in Māori ownership until 1958, when it, and around 120 acres of the surrounding forest, was transferred to the Historic Places Trust, the predecessor of Heritage New Zealand. Shortly afterwards, Ormond Wilson, the chairman of the Historic Places Trust, commenced efforts to restore Te Pōrere. The site was declared a National Historic Place on 18 February 1961 by the Governor-General of New Zealand, Viscount Cobham, in a ceremony at the site, which also included a dedication to the 37 followers of Te Kooti killed in the Battle of Te Pōrere and buried within the upper redoubt. \nAs part of the restoration work, vegetation was cut back, the breastworks of the redoubts reconstructed, and a pathway constructed between the site and a car park located off State Highway 47. Te Pōrere is considered to be the best preserved pā site in New Zealand, although not the best example. The fortifications at Te Pōrere were designated as a Category 1 Historic Place by Heritage New Zealand in March 2006, with the list number 7652.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBelich, James (1998) [1986].

It was built at a cost of 6,000 gold dinars and inaugurated in April/May 1105. Its name derived from a row of seven domed tombs in the vicinity, which from the distance is supposed to have looked like armed warriors riding on an elephant. \nIn 1119, work began to install a new observatory at the mosque, in order to revise the astronomical tables (zij) used at the time in Egypt, that were hopelessly out of date. The affair turned into a fiasco: costs skyrocketed, especially for the large, and difficult to cast, bronze rings used for observations. Even when the latter were successfully cast and installed on the roof of the mosque, it turned out that the Muqattam Hills actually blocked the view of the sun during sunrise; the whole apparatus had to be transported to a new site on the Muqattam itself. \nThe mosque was already ruined by the 14th century, when the Bedouin are recorded as watering their camels in its cistern. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\nHalm, Heinz (2014).

        "content": "Marinated mushrooms are forest or cultivated edible mushrooms preserved in various ways using vinegar and possibly additionally pasteurized; used as a spicy addition to food.\nMarinated mushrooms are a traditional dish in Polish cuisine and are characteristic of other national cuisines as well.\nThe marinating process gives the mushrooms a characteristic tangy taste and attractive appearance. Marinated mushrooms can be made at home or produced on an industrial scale.\n\n\n== Preparation according to Polish tradition ==\nMarinated mushrooms are prepared from fresh mushrooms, which are first cooked and then marinated in a vinegar brine with spices.\n\n\n=== Marination ===\n\nMarination, including mushrooms, is achieved by pouring a solution of hot vinegar, which is a faster method of preservation, providing better control over texture and salt content, but with a less rich flavor than fermentation-based pickling. The final concentration of vinegar is around 2.5%. Marinated products are additionally subjected to temperature treatment to prevent spoilage. The flavor can be enhanced by adding spices or sugar.\nSuitable mushrooms for marinating include boletus, delicious milk cap, suillus, leccinum, honey fungus, tricholoma, agaricus, and girolle, preferably small, young, and firm ones.\nOne can also use young and healthy larger mushrooms divided into halves or quarters. Different types of mushrooms should be marinated separately. They should be cleaned, trimmed, and rinsed to remove dirt and sand.\n\n\n=== Recipe ===\nThe proportions of ingredients for 1 kg of mushrooms are: 20 g of salt per 1 liter of water in which the mushrooms are blanched, 100 g of onion, 1¼ cups of water, 1¼ cups of vinegar (10%), 50 g of sugar, 10 g of salt, 5 g of spices (pepper, allspice, bay leaves). The mushrooms should be placed in a small amount of water boiled with salt and whole or halved onions. After cooking almost until soft, they should be removed, drained, placed in jars, and left to cool. The vinegar solution is prepared by boiling water with vinegar, sugar, salt, and spices; it is poured over the mushrooms after cooling. Small onions scalded with water and blanched carrot slices can be added to the jars. Then the jars can be sealed.\n\n\n=== Production ===\nIn addition to individual production of this dish by consumers, marinated mushrooms are also produced industrially. In retail, marinated mushrooms such as agaricus, girolle, bay bolete, slippery jack, boletus and delicious milk cap are available, produced by various manufacturers.\nAfter pasteurization, their shelf life can be extended up to 3 years without the need for refrigeration.\nMost commonly, pasteurized marinated mushrooms are packaged in glass jars.\n\n\n=== Other preservation methods ===\nIn addition to mushrooms preserved using vinegar or acetic acid, mushrooms can be preserved by adding gluconolactone, temporarily preserved before further processing using a concentrated solution of table salt, known as brine.\nMarinated mushrooms may also contain other additives such as vegetable oil.\nIn English, the equivalents of Polish marinated mushrooms are the terms \"marinated\" or \"pickled\", referring to mushrooms prepared or preserved using vinegar or acetic acid.\nA different method of preserving fresh mushrooms is by pickling them and optionally pasteurizing the already pickled mushrooms.\n\n\n=== Methods of consumption ===\nIn Poland, marinated mushrooms are often served as an accompaniment to game dishes, pork, beef, and poultry. They can be consumed as an appetizer and a snack with alcoholic beverages. Finely chopped marinated mushrooms are also an ingredient in tartar sauce. They are also used for garnishing.\n\n\n=== Traditional Polish products ===\n\nSeveral variations of marinated mushrooms have been registered by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development as traditional products.\n\nGreater Poland cep – the characteristic feature of this product is a clear (\"crystalline\") marinade without sediment. The fruiting bodies of the ceps are first soaked in a solution of water and wine, then boiled in a vinegar marinade with spices, after which the mushrooms are rinsed and covered with hot, fresh marinade and pasteurized twice with a 24-hour interval;\nMarinated mushrooms with pine cone from the West Pomeranian Voivodeship have a tradition dating back to 1955. At that time, they began to be prepared by adding honey and a green pine cone to the vinegar marinade during cooking, which soften and enrich the marinade's aromas. These mushrooms, prepared in this way, are served with game dishes, pork, beef, and poultry;\nBug marinated mushrooms from the Podlaskie Voivodeship do not deviate from the general recipe but may be marinated with paprika, with the addition of garlic, and differ in the amount of sugar in the marinade and the concentration of vinegar.\n\n\n== In the cuisine of different culinary cultures ==\nThe tradition of preserving mushrooms through marinating, drying, and pickling has long been practiced in the kitchens of many cultures: European, Asian, and Latin American. Marinating mushrooms in vinegar is characteristic of many national cuisines, such as Russian, Belarusian, Estonian, and Jewish (both Ashkenazi and Sephardic). In French cuisine, vinaigrette is used to marinate mushrooms. Marinated mushrooms are eagerly purchased by Chinese and Japanese consumers. In Japanese cuisine, marinated shiitake mushrooms are added to numerous ready-made dishes as one of the ingredients or as decoration (for example, shiitake mushrooms can be marinated in a solution of rice vinegar with added sugar, salt, and pepper). Marinated mushrooms are also produced in India. The popularizer of mushroom marinating in contemporary Swedish cuisine is chef Per Morberg, who recommends serving them with game, pork, and roast beef. Mushrooms are traditionally marinated in Mediterranean countries, alongside marinating vegetables and fish. In Italian cuisine, they are served as one of the elements of antipasto. Wild or cultivated mushrooms are marinated in Mexican cuisine, where setas con vinagre, or wild mushrooms in vinegar, are a traditional appetizer in Veracruz.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Babylonians were already using vinegar as a means of preserving and pickling food – the first mention of this dates back to around 3000 years AC. However, the first recipes for preparing marinated mushrooms appeared in cookbooks in the mid-17th century.\nIn English cuisine, marinated mushrooms were traditionally added to stews of meat, poultry, fish, and eggs. In Polish cuisine, they were used in roast dishes.\n\n\n=== In cookbooks ===\nMikołaj Rej in Żywot człowieka poczciwego wrote about drying and salting mushrooms as methods of preserving them, but did not mention marinating in vinegar, even though in the same paragraph he described the preparation of pickled beets and fennel.\nIn the first Polish cookbook, Compendium ferculorum, albo Zebranie potraw from 1682, authored by Stanisław Czerniecki, the master chef of the Kraków duke, Aleksander Michał Lubomirski, various types of mushrooms essential for household needs were listed, including fresh mushrooms, dried mushrooms, fresh delicious milk cap, salted delicious milk cap, fresh agaricus, and agaricus in butter, but no mention was made of any kind of marinated mushrooms.\nIn Jakub Kazimierz Haur's book Oekonomika ziemiańska generalna from 1675 (later editions in 1744), there is no information about marinating mushrooms, although the author advises salting and smoking mushrooms in August.\nDuring this time, in 1695, in France, the French Academy published a dictionary Le dictionnaire de l'Académie françoise, dédié au Roy, which as an illustration of the word mariné (marinate) provided the phrase des champignons marinez (marinated mushrooms). In England, marinated mushrooms were mentioned in the rural dictionary Dictionarium Rusticum & Urbanicum. Or, A Dictionary of All Sorts of Country Affairs, Handicraft, Trading, and Merchandizing by John Worlidge and Nathan Bailey, published in 1704.\nIn the first half of the 18th century, numerous English cookbooks contained recipes for marinating mushrooms, sometimes even several different ones. Marinating mushrooms was discussed in household manuals for both women, such as The Whole Duty of a Woman, Or, An Infallible Guide to the Fair Sex from 1737, and for men, such as The Complete family-piece; and, country gentleman, and farmer's, best guide, also published in 1737. From the latter, there is a specific recipe for cooking mushrooms in milk and using nutmeg and mace as spices. The recipe from the book for women is identical word for word.\nIn Johann Gottlieb Gleditsch's book on mushrooms Methodus fungorum, published in Berlin in 1753, marinated mushrooms were mentioned. Likewise, in the contemporary French culinary dictionary Dictionnaire des alimens, vins et liqueurs, leurs qualité, leurs effets etc. from 1750, there was a recipe for marinating mushrooms. In German, a recipe for marinated mushrooms appeared in Johann Georg Krünitz's Oekonomische Encyklopädie in 1776.\nThe English book The Accomplished Housekeeper, and Universal Cook by T. Williams, published in 1797, contained numerous examples of using marinated mushrooms in the kitchen. They were used as a flavor enhancer for meat, fish, poultry dishes, and even eggs.\nDuring the same period in Poland, in the translated and adapted French book Kucharz doskonały by Wojciech Wielądko from 1783, there was no recipe for marinating mushrooms or any mention of them. Recipes for marinated mushrooms in vinegar appeared in a Polish cookbook from the late 18th century: the anonymous book Gospodarz doskonały, first published in Dresden in 1790, contained a recipe for marinated delicious milk caps.\nIn Russia, in 1792, a book titled \"Новый совершенный российский повар и кандитер, или, Подробный поваренский и кандитерский словарь\" was printed, containing a recipe for marinating mushrooms with the addition of pepper, ginger root, and cloves as spices. The recipe also included a brochure translated from German \"О грибах, употребляемых в пищу\" from 1834, which proposed pepper, bay leaves, mustard, and cloves as spices for marinating mushrooms. Marinating forest mushrooms, specifically ceps, was also suggested in the German work Neues auf Erfahrung gegründetes leichtfaßliches Kochbuch für jede Haushaltung by M. A. Salzmann from 1835.\nIn Poland, in the 19th century, an anonymous Polish publication Kucharka wiedeńska provided a recipe for preserving mushrooms.\nMarinated mushrooms also appeared in the cookbook by Lucyna Ćwierczakiewiczowa from 1893, where the author provided a method for marinating them. She also pointed out an alternative method for marinating mushrooms, which she believed was commonly used by chefs: rinsed mushrooms should be placed in boiling, heavily salted water, and after boiling, drained and poured into jars with cold vinegar with a small amount of spices.\nThis dish was also mentioned in the Soviet encyclopedia \"Краткая энциклопедия домашнего хозяйства\" (Moscow, 1960) and in the commodity dictionary \"Товарный словарь\" (vol. III, Moscow, 1957).\n\n\n== Cultural references ==\nIn Powieści mniejsze by Nikolai Gogol, depicting the daily life of the society in which the writer lived, one can read about various types of marinated mushrooms, such as those marinated in cherry vinegar with cloves and walnuts or those marinated with currant leaves and nutmeg, served as appetizers by Pulcheria Ivanovna to her guests.\nIn Mikhail Bulgakov's novel The Master and Margarita, Behemoth accompanies his vodka with marinated boletus while Woland converses with Stepan Likhodeev in the latter's bedroom at Sadovaya 302a. In the same novel, Arkady Apollonovich Sempleyarov, the chairman of the Acoustic Committee of Moscow theaters, is eventually transferred to the position of manager of a forest produce collection point in Bryansk, causing the residents of Moscow to now eat salted mushrooms and marinated boletus, they cannot praise them enough and are enthusiastic about the fact that Arkady Apollonovich changed his job.\nIn Olga Tokarczuk's short story Przetwory from the collection Opowiadania bizarne (2018), a fifty-year-old unemployed man sustains himself on preserves prepared by his mother before her death. His last meal consists of the contents of a jar labeled \"Marinated Mushroom, 2005\". These \"mushrooms\" turned out to be poisonous – a mistake in the labeling was a warning that he ignored.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Wuling Binguo Plus (Chinese: 五菱宾果Plus), commonly mentioned in English sources as the Wuling Bingo Plus, is a battery electric subcompact crossover SUV manufactured by SAIC-GM-Wuling (SGMW) since 2024 under the Wuling brand.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nFollowing the success with the Binguo hatchback, there had been a growing demand for electric vehicles with extended range capabilities combined with the need for a spacious interior and enhanced performance. Therefore, Wuling developed the Binguo Plus to meet these consumer demands. The Binguo Plus went on sale in China on 6 March 2024 with two variants.\nThe exterior design of the Binguo Plus takes on modern aesthetics with muscular design cues and fewer rounded design elements, compared to the Binguo hatchback. The front has a less rounded headlight design, blade-style front air outlets, and a high-angled windscreen. The side has aluminium aerodynamic alloy wheels and kink in window line that emphasises the dual-tone exterior colour. The rear has a miminalistic approach like the Binguo hatchback, however the Plus model features combination LED taillights. Consumers have the option of three exterior colours: Aurora Green, Storm Gray and Quantum Black.\nThe interior of the Binguo Plus takes on a minimalistic approach, with the dashboard adopting a floating island double-layer design. The dashboard features are two LCD screens that are separated opposed to being merged. The interior adopts a 360-degree skin-friendly soft package design with seats made from faux suede. Consumers have the option of two interior colours: Sky Green and Warm Sand White.\nThanks to the use of Wuling's wide-adapted pure electric space platform, it has the longest wheelbase in its class at 2610mm and provides a 912mm long second-row seat spacing and a knee-to-knee distance of 89mm. The boot space stands at 1,450 L (51 cu ft) with rear seats are folded down. Inside, there are up to 23 user-friendly storage spaces.\n\n\n== Specifications ==\nThe Binguo Plus is equipped with a 75 kW (101 hp; 102 PS) 3-in-1 water-cooled flat wire single electric motor produces a maximum torque of 180 Nm (133 lb ft). There are two range options: 401 km and 510 km. There are three charging modes which includes fast DC charging, from 30 - 80% capacity in 30–35 minutes.\nThe Binguo Plus is equipped with a thermal management system and smart energy management technology, this means it claims to achieve an estimated range of 10.1-10.6 km per kWh.\n\n\n== References ==",

The fight was finalized at the end June and set for 31 August at the The O2 Arena.\nLomachenko would praise Campbell in the build up, saying \"He has a big reach and he has a high boxing IQ, maybe for me it will be a big challenge.\" Campbell would say that \"I've never shied away from a challenge, we're the best two in the division and you're going to see one hell of a fight.\"\nOn the undercard, Charlie Edwards defended his WBC flyweight title against the top ranked Julio Cesar Martinez and former world heavyweight title challengers Alexander Povetkin (WBC:7th WBA:10th) & Hughie Fury (WBC:22nd IBF:12th) faced each other for the WBA International title.\n\n\n== The fights ==\n\n\n=== Undercard ===\nJoe Cordina retained British and Commonwealth lightweight titles against fellow welshman Gavin Gwynne.\n\n\n=== Edwards vs Martinez ===\nMartinez made an aggressive start and in the third round Edwards was forced to take a knee after a number of body shots. While his left glove and knee were touching the canvas, Martinez landed a shot to the ribs that Edwards prevented Edwards from beating the count. The replays of the incident prompted a chorus of boos from the crowd. Martinez was initially declared the KO winner and the new WBC flyweight world champion. However Edwards's promoter Eddie Hearn, instantly appealed to the WBC, speaking in the aftermath would describe the knockout shot as \"so late it was next week\". Less than 10 minutes after the fight ended, WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman ruled the bout a no contest, meaning that Edwards retained his title.\n\n\n=== Povetkin vs Fury ===\nIn the chief support, Fury would start the stronger making use of his 5 inch reach advantage, however as the bout wore on Povetkin would find ways of landing with his right hand and by the ninth round Fury was cut near his left eye. Povetkin did tire late on but Fury could take advantage. At the end of 12 rounds Povetkin won an unanimous decision with all three judges scoring the bout 117-111 in the Russian favour.\n\n\n=== Main Event ===\nAfter a cagey first of couple of rounds, where Campbell used both his reach and height advantage to keep Lomachenko off balance and at a distance, before the champion found the mark with some sharp combinations. Lomachenko hurt Campbell badly at the end of fifth with a string of hooks to the body and head that left the challenger on the brink of going down before the ring sounded to end the round. With just over a minute left in the 11th round a pair of  hooks to the body followed by a right to the head sent Campbell down, he beat the count and made it to the final bell. The bout went to the judges, two of them scored it 119-108, with the another having it 118-109 all in favour of Lomachenko.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nSpeaking in ring after the bout Lomachenko praised Campbell saying \"He has big amateur experience, he's a smart fighter, a technical fighter and you saw his reach so of course it was hard for me. He gave me a good experience and a good fight. I want a unification fight for the four belts.\" Campbell likewise would praise Lomachenko saying \"He is so good, he adapts to any plans, tonight was not the jackpot but my time will come.\" He would later describe the bout as first time he ever been \"truly beaten\".\nFormer world champion Carl Frampton, speaking as part of the BBC Radio 5 Live commentary team, was among those impressed by Campbell effort saying \"I never expected that. It was down to Luke Campbell who showed such skill alongside grit and determination. His stock has risen dramatically tonight even though he is the loser. I think Lomachenko underplayed how hard that was. I think it's the toughest fight he has had as a professional.\"\n\n\n== Undercard ==\nConfirmed bouts:\n\n\n== Broadcasting ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Sobering Romance (in German: Sachliche Romanze) is considered to be one of the best and beloved poems by Erich Kästner (1899–1974). It first was published in the Vossische Zeitung at Berlin on April 20, 1928, and was republished in Kästner's second volume of poetry Lärm im Spiegel (Noise in the mirror) a year later.\n\n\n== Source text and its translation ==\n\nTranslated by Natias Neutert; published in Foolnotes\n\n\n== Titling ==\nThe titling of Kästner's poem is pure irony by using an Oxymoron. namely the contradiction between romanticism and soberness. The title fits the sad content of the poem.\nIn addition the title is particularly ingenious: With the adjective „Sober“ it also indicates the stylistic affiliation to the Gebrauchslyrik (Lyrics for Everyday Use), which made Kästner one of the leading figure of the Neue Sachlichkeit movement, which focused on using a sobering style to satirise contemporary society.\n\n\n== Sujet ==\nThe poem is about an eight-year relationship that falls apart. What the former lovers did not want to admit.\n\n\n== Versification ==\nThe poem has an iambic meter with predominantly masculine cadences. It  consists of four stanzas with a total of 17 verses. The first three stanzas have four verses and the last stanza five. In terms of the rhyme scheme, the cross rhyme is used in all verses, „the fifth verse of the fourth stanza stands alone and therefore without a rhyme echo — signaling the coming loneliness of those two human beings.“ The end rhymes are, as always in Kästner's poetry, perfect. The only exception in the German original is the end of the line \"kannten\" in the first verse and the end of the line \"abhanden\" in the third verse: they are assonant and so-called slant rhymes. However, this did not detract from the rhythmic and melodic momentum in any way.\n\n\n== Literary Style ==\n\nKästner is the most prominent protagonist of New Objectivity (in German: Neue Sachlichkeit), a style movement in art, literature, film and architecture during the 1920s in Germany as a reaction against the domination of expressionism.\nIn the literary field, he is characterized by an imageless, unadorned, simple and clear language that is congruent with colloquial language.\n\n\n== Impact ==\nNowadays, when Kästner's 125th birthday is being celebrated all over the world, one can state the following: More relevant than ever: Erich Kästner (in German: Relevanter denn je: Erich Kästner). As a poet, Kästner has managed to make poetry popular again in Germany, as Deutschlandfunk emphasized in its English forum longer ago. Together with Goethe and other great figures, Kästner is included in the List of „The 10 most important poets and writers from Germany“. There are 96 streets and more than 100 schools named after Erich Kästner in Germany.\n\nLike many of his other poems, Sobering Romance also has had a tremendous influence on the popularity of the Gebrauchslyrik. \nThis is confirmed not least by the fact that Campino, the singer-songwriter of the band  Die Toten Hosen, was allowed to give two lectures on this topic as a Heinrich Heine-guest professor at the Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf on April 2, 2024. And so even his first lecture made a direct reference to Kästner with this telling title: Kästner, Kraftwerk, Cock Sparrer — Eine Liebeserklärung an die Gebrauchslyrik (A declaration of love to Lyrics of Every Day Use).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Republic of Montmartre (French: République de Montmartre) is a philanthropic association, born one winter evening in 1920, on the initiative of the cartoonist Jean Barrez. In front of an audience composed of Adolphe Willette, Jean-Louis Forain, Francisque Poulbot, Maurice Neumont, Louis Morin, Maurice Millière, Raoul Guérin, Jules Depaquit, he proposes, faced with the invasion of modernism without limits, to create an association aimed at maintaining the spirit and mutual aid of Montmartre artists, in addition to the festive spirit already put forward for several months by the Free Commune of Montmartre, and to preserve the village from the excesses of promoters.\n\n\n== Some story elements ==\n\n\n=== Creation of the Free Commune of Montmartre ===\n\nThe birth certificate of a claim to the independence of Montmartre is probably a proclamation of Louis XVI dated June 22, CE 1790, authorizing the inhabitants of La Butte to constitute a municipality outside the walls. The Wall of the Ferme générale had separated it from Paris, and those of La Butte took advantage of it to consolidate their autonomy. In CE 1871, the Commune of Montmartre and its young mayor, Georges Clemenceau, saw, in a more tragic way, violent crowd movements erupt in this place, which attacked two generals, the starting point of the Parisian insurrection of the Commune of Paris.\nAt the end of the Commune, which ended with the massacre of Parisian insurgents on the orders of the government of Adolphe Thiers, during the Bloody Week, the Basilica of the Sacré-Cœur of Montmartre was established there to reestablish “moral order.”\nAt the end of the CE 19th century and beginning of the CE 20th century, the lower Montmartre district saw a proliferation of cabarets, while on the heights, a bohemian painters and writers mingle with “the petty bourgeois in shirt sleeves”, with retirees digging “their peas on rue de la Bonne”, and with a few thugs and penniless individuals. The World War I turned the Parisian world upside down, creating a thirst for modernity. Developers are invading Montmartre and some politicians dream of a sanitized neighborhood where buildings could replace the old shacks and gardens.\nIn April CE.1920, the designer Jules Depaquit, friend of Max Jacob and Pierre Mac Orlan, and a few friends, including the singers Roger Toziny and Maurice Hallé, reacted by creating the Free Commune of Montmartre.\n\n\n=== Creation of the Republic of Montmartre ===\nIn November CE 1920, Joé Bridge, designer and printer, and some other artists or friends of the arts, including Adolphe Willette, Jean-Louis Forain, Francisque Poulbot, Maurice Neumont, Louis Morin, Maurice Millière, Raoul Guérin and Jules Depaquit, decide to prolong the spirit of the Free Commune of Montmartre by creating a Republic of Montmartre.\nThe goal is not political. Navigating between nostalgia and modernity, it is a question of asserting a distinctive community identity centered around mutual aid and sociability, beyond the festive character already highlighted by the municipality, and of trying to limit the influence urban in the village of Montmartre. The Republic of Montmartre clearly includes a charitable dimension towards the various residents of the Butte. On May 7 CE 1921, this Republic of Montmartre filed its statutes.\n\n\n=== Official anthem ===\nIn CE 1923, the singer Lucien Boyer composed the text of the official anthem of the RDM. The recording on disk of Monte là-d’ssus… tu verras Montmartre ! was done the same year with the RDM steering committee.\n\n\n=== Francisque Poulbot ===\nAt the time, the neighborhood was poverty-stricken and children were often barefoot in the street.\nAfter setting up the dispensary which ensures health, hygiene, food and clothing for children, Francisque Poulbot and his friends want to offer them moments of joy and dreams.\nFor this, from CE 1921 to 1931, they organized “Christmas Trees”. These festivals, with shows and gifts, take place at the Moulin-Rouge, at the Moulin de la Galette or at the Cirque Medrano. The little patients of the Bretonneau hospital are not forgotten.\n\n\n=== Montmartre Republic Festival ===\nAmong the most famous festivals organized by the RDM for the benefit of underprivileged children, include the Granville Carnival in 1923, the Fratellini Festival in 1924, the Polin Ball in 1925, the Montmartre Station in 1931, the Village Festival in June 1932, the Bal des Gars de la Narine in November 1932.\nLet us also remember the Main Festival which took place in 1929, a celebration which resulted in the most beautiful example of the preservation of the sites. Indeed, opposing a real estate project distorting the rural spirit of the place, Francisque Poulbot, Romain Delahalle and their friends from the Republic of Montmartre created, at the corner of rue des Saules and rue Saint-Vincent, a green space, called “square de la Liberté”, intended for the children of La Butte.\n\n\n=== Vineyards and Clos Montmartre ===\n\nInaugurated with pomp, this space of games and joy will not attract the attention of the municipal authorities. The idea of planting vines there was then born.\nIt was only in 1933 that the Free Commune of Montmartre, under the aegis of its mayor Pierre Labric, decided to bring this project to fruition with the support of Poulbot and the Republic of Montmartre. The vine stocks are reborn on the Butte. In 1934 the first “modern” harvests took place in the presence of the President of the French Republic, Albert Lebrun, and under the sponsorship of Fernandel and Mistinguett.\nSince then, every year, in October, this idea of the Republic of Montmartre has become the famous Montmartre Harvest Festival, in which participate, in the company of the Queen of the Harvest, the godfathers and godmothers (chosen from among personalities such as actors, singers, writers, etc.), colorful brotherhoods and brass bands from various countries.\nFor more than 70 years, in homage to Poulbot, the harvest ban has traditionally been opened by the President of the Republic of Montmartre on these few acres of land located between the Lapin Agile and the former home of Aristide Bruant.\n\n\n=== Other events ===\nOn September 20, CE 1985, the mayor of the free commune of Montmartre sealed the union, the \"gag marriage\", \"for the best and for laughter\", of two famous comedians and provocateurs, Coluche, the bride, and Thierry Le Luron, the groom.\n\n\n== Presidents of the Republic of Montmartre ==\n\n\n=== Honorary citizens ===\nAlain Juppé and Anne Hidalgo are among the honorary citizens of the Republic of Montmartre.\n\n\n== Twinning ==\nThe Republic of Montmartre is twinned with the République des Canuts, to Lyon, its counterpart croix-roussien.\nSince 1959, it has also been with the municipality of Viré (in Mâconnais).\nSaint-Cyr-sur-Morin is also twinned with Montmartre, as has the Commune libre des Trois-Maisons, in [[Nancy], since 1950].\nThe Republic of Montmartre is also twinned with the Association des amis d'Alphonse Allais (president: Philippe Davis).\nSince 2013, the Republic of Montmartre has been twinned with the city of Culoz. This twinning was built around the destiny of the Serpollet brothers, originally from Culoz and who set up their factory in Montmartre. ·  \nOn June 15, 2013, the Republic of Montmartre was twinned with Clos Gerberoy in Gerberoy, classified one of the most beautiful villages in France. The vineyards were created in 2004 by Jean-Pierre His, former President of the Republic of Montmartre with the former honorary mayor of Gerberoy Louis Vallois and Étienne Le Sidaner, the grandson of the painter Henri Le Sidaner, whose garden labelled \"Remarkable Garden\" overlooks Gerberoy.\n\n\n== References and notes ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nJean Couvreur (29 April 1960). \"Montmartre installe son musée\".

        "content": "Rachel Subusola Olutimayin was the first woman to be the Director of Public Prosecutions in the Solomon Islands. She was born in Nigeria but her nationality was Fijian.\n\n\n== Life ==\nOlutimayin was born in Nigeria but her nationality was Fijian and she gives her residence as Canada.\nShe came to the Solomon Islands in 2003 as part of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands. She worked for the Islands' public solicitor and for the Director of Public Prosecutions. In 2009 she was employed by the University of the South Pacific as a senior lecturer while supplying her expertise to settling difficult cases. \nIn 2019 Olutimayin took over from Ronald Bei Talasasa who had been the country's Director of Public Prosecutions. Ethel Sigimanu who was the ministry of justice's permanent secretary gave her the contract and she noted the significance of her appointment as the first woman DPP. She was sworn in as the DPP by the Governor General David Vunagi.\nShe was part of continued efforts to remove the gender bias in the Solomon Islands' justice system. This idea received support from Australia and the United Nations. Studies had shown that women in the Solomon Islands were not contributing to the economy because of \"domestic and sexual violence, bullying, and sexual harassment\". Sally-Anne Vincent, then deputy High Commissioner, said in 2021 that the governmement had seen how this discrimination affected their country.\nIn September 2023 her term as Director of Public Prosecutions came to an end and she was replaced by Andrew. E. Kelesi who had served as her deputy.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Fabiana Palladino is the debut album by British pop musician Fabiana Palladino. The release was recorded over the course of multiple years and has received positive reviews by critics.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nAccording to the review aggregator Metacritic, Fabiana Palladino received \"universal acclaim\" based on a weighted average score of 88 out of 100 from five critic scores. Editors at AllMusic rated this album 4.5 out of 5 stars, with critic Andy Kellman writing that this album \"is one creatively askew pop-R&B delight after another, all voiced with captivating and confident flair by a razor-sharp songwriter\", whom he compares to Prince. Harry Thorfinn-George at The Arts Desk gave Fabiana Palladino 4 out of 5 stars, characterizing the work as \"a strong debut album which serves as a formal introduction to an artist who has been on the side-lines for too long\". Editors at The Fader chose this among the best releases of the week, where Sandra Song called it \"vulnerable, honest, and intimate... [with a] kind of raw human touch you'd expect from a D.I.Y. bedroom musician\" in spite of \"the sleek, hyper-produced grandeur of her '80s pop-R&B production\".In The Guardian, Alexis Petridis chose this as his album of the week, giving it 5 out of 5 stars and stated that \"for all the knowing signifiers from the age of power-dressing and rolled-up suit sleeves... the album never feels like a retro exercise\" and he considered it \"devoid of weak tracks or ideas that don't gel, it's an album that sounds as if it was made by someone who knows exactly what she's doing\" That newspaper published a second review by Shaad D'Souza who compared this music to Janet Jackson and called it \"a sharp debut that knows the power of patience and tension\". Sam Franzini at The Line of Best Fit rated Fabiana Palladino an 8 out of 10, characterizing it as \"a near-effortless reinvention of retro pop, soul, funk, and R&B tracks with a glossy modern sheen, setting the stage for more grandiose statements in the future\".At musicOMH, Ben Devlin rated this work 4 out of 5 stars, stating that it was \"surely... worth the wait\" after Palladino released an intermittent series of singles for several years leading up to this album, which Devlin writes \"takes inspiration from a grab bag of stars and styles, from R&B to disco, the results are sometimes charmingly retro and other times fresh and inventive\". This was Album of the Week at Stereogum, where critic Caleb Catlin cautioned listeners that \"because of the production's intricately designed architecture, a listener might mistake this for a scholarly form of pop, as music that only the sophisticated avid listener can engage with\" but continued that \"she communicates directly, and the album is a lot punchier for it\". Grant Sharples at Uproxx included Fabiana Palladino as one of the best indie music albums of the week, writing that Palladino has \"carved out her own style at the nexus of indie-pop and ’80s soul, adjusting her elastic voice to suit her own vision rather than someone else’s\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Closer\" – 3:35\n\"Can You Look in the Mirror?\" – 3:19\n\"I Can't Dream Anymore\" – 3:12\n\"Give Me a Sign\" – 3:18\n\"I Care\" – 4:18\n\"Stay with Me Through the Night\" – 3:36\n\"Shoulda\" – 4:29\n\"Deeper\" – 3:44\n\"In the Fire\" – 3:57\n\"Forever\" – 3:59\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nFabiana Palladino – instrumentation, vocals, production\nHarry Craze – production\nSteve Ferrone – drums\nRob Moose – string arrangement\nGiancarla Palladino\nMaz Palladino\nPino Palladino – bass guitar\nRocco Palladino\nJai Paul – on \"I Care\"\nJamie Woon – backing vocals\n\n\n== See also ==\n2024 in British music\nList of 2024 albums\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFabiana Palladino at Discogs (list of releases) \nFabiana Palladino at MusicBrainz (list of releases)",

        "content": "Jan Baetens, born September 5, 1957, in Saint-Nicolas (in the province of East Flanders), is a Belgian poet, essayist, curator, editor and critic with Flemish as his first language but writing in French.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJan Baetens was born on the 5 September 1957 in Saint-Nicolas.\nHe is a professor of cultural studies at the  Leuven University, as well as being both a poet and critic.\nAs a poet, he began in 1998 (over 40 years old) with 416 Heptasyllables (bilingual edition with Dutch translation/transposition by Dirk van Bastelaere) and he has published a dozen collections, including Cent Fois sur le métier (2004), which won the triennial poetry prize from the Wallonia-Brussels Federation in 2007. Very close to so-called “constraint” poetry in his first texts, he gradually opened up to freer forms of expression. From a thematic point of view, he attaches great importance to the representation of everyday life in its most unexpected and humble forms, from which humor is never absent: basketball, comics and Sunday poets are some of his favorite subjects.\nAs a critic, Jan Baetens publishes both studies on poetry and numerous academic works on the relationships between texts and images, especially in so-called minor genres such as novelizations, photo comics, or the film photo comic.\nCo-founder of the publishing house Les Impressions nouvelles, he also participated in the creation and management of the magazines Conséquences (1984–1993), Formules (1995-...) and Formes poétiques contemporaines (2002-...) .\nHe frequently collaborates with Milan Chlumsky, a Czech-German photographer, and Olivier Deprez, a wood engraver and member of the FRMK group.\nIn 2008, he curated the first retrospective of Marie-Françoise Plissart at the Antwerp Photography Museum.\nIn 2013, he participated in the artist residency project organized by the Brussels collective (SIC) as part of the Venice \"off\" Festival. His contribution La Belgique à Venise Venice is published in a collective volume of (SIC) dedicated to this residency.\nIn 2015, he participated in the Atopolis catalog, a contemporary art exhibition organized by the Wiels contemporary art center for Mons 2015.\nSince 2019, he has co-directed, with the Franco-Iranian artist Narmine Sadeg, the bilingual website PLACE where literature and visual arts intersect.\nIn 2019, he curated, with Géraldine David, the retrospective exhibition of Olivier Deprez, Wrek, not work, at the Bibliotheca Wittockiana.\nIn 2023, he participated, in collaboration with Olivier Deprez, in the exhibition celebrating the 15th anniversary of Textimage magazine: \"Ce qui a été, ce qui reste\".\nThroughout his life as a teacher, he organized exhibitions at the University Library of Leuven: the photo novel, the journal Arts et métiers graphiques, the journal L'Immédiate (in collaboration with the CEEI center for studies on writing and images) and the Belgian photo comic or the film-photo-novel.\nHe has been a member of the management committee of INSL (international network for the study of poetry) since 2019. He is currently president for the period 2023–2025.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHe lives in Leuven.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Poetry ===\n\n\n=== Novel ===\nFaire sécession.

        "content": "The Battle of Te Pōrere was an engagement that took place at Te Pōrere on 4 October 1869 in the Central Plateau region of New Zealand's North Island during Te Kooti's War. It was the last major engagement of the New Zealand Wars.\nTe Kooti's War was part of the New Zealand Wars, a series of conflicts between the British, the local authorities and their Māori allies on one side, and several Māori iwi (tribes) on the other, that took place from 1843 to 1872. Te Kooti, the founder of the Ringatū religion, gathered a following of disenfranchised Māori who like himself had been exiled in 1866 to the Chatham Islands by the government. In July 1868, he and his followers escaped to the mainland, landing on the East Coast. Over the next several months, Te Kooti and his adherents skirmished with the local militia, the Armed Constabulary and Māori aligned with the government—known as kūpapa. After a defeat at Ngatapa in January 1869, Te Kooti moved into the interior of the central North Island, finding refuge initially in the Te Urewera ranges before moving to the Central Plateau later in the year.  \nTe Pōrere was a pā (hillfort) that was constructed in the style of a redoubt and garrisoned by Te Kooti and his Ringatū warriors in September. A force of Armed Constabulary and kūpapa, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Thomas McDonnell, was still in pursuit of Te Kooti and on 4 October, attacked Te Pōrere. Te Kooti's skirmishers quickly fell back from outlying fortifications to the poorly designed main redoubt. This was quickly overwhelmed by the attackers with relatively few losses. The battle was a major defeat for Te Kooti and at least 37 of his followers were killed and many others taken prisoner. Wounded during the engagement, he escaped into the bush along with other survivors. Te Kooti never again fought from a prepared defensive position and instead reverted to a guerilla campaign until 1872, when he found refuge in the King Country. He was pardoned several years later.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nFrom 1843 to 1872, there were a series of conflicts in New Zealand between some local Māori people on one side, and British imperial and colonial forces and their Māori allies on the other. These clashes are collectively termed the New Zealand Wars. While some of the wars of this period were as a result of land confiscations or clashes with the Māori King Movement, many of the later conflicts were due to the rise of prophetic Māori leaders and religious movements which threatened the autonomy of the government. These movements also subverted tribalism so often were met with hostility by the leaders of many iwi (tribes) as well. Te Kooti's War was the last of these later wars, and marked the final field engagements of the New Zealand Wars.  \nThe earliest conflicts of the New Zealand Wars saw Māori warriors using muskets in addition to their traditional weapons, such as striking staffs—or taiaha—and war clubs—or mere. By the time of Te Kooti's War, they were equipped with modern Snider–Enfield rifles; either captured in battle or purchased from arms dealers. They still retained their close combat weapons and were also known to use shotguns. Their opponents also used Snider-Enfield rifles but could rely on more reliable and robust supplies of ammunition compared to the Māori, who would have to rely on what they captured or scavenged.\n\n\n=== Te Kooti ===\nTe Kooti was a Māori warrior of the Rongowhakaata iwi (tribe) who in 1865 had fought on the side of the New Zealand colonial government against the Pai Mārire religious movement during the siege of Waerenga-a-Hika in Poverty Bay. Afterwards, already regarded as a troublemaker by the settlers in the region and some local Māori, he was arrested on the grounds of being a spy after communications between Te Kooti and a Pai Mārire leader was intercepted. In March 1866 he was exiled without a trial to the Chatham Islands along with 200 Pai Mārire warriors and their families. While there he developed his own religion, Ringatū. In 1868, he and his followers escaped from captivity and commandeered a vessel to take them to the East Coast region, landing back at Poverty Bay in July.\n\n\n=== Pursuit of Te Kooti ===\nTe Kooti and his Ringatū warriors were pursued by the local militia in order to prevent them moving inland. A series of defeats followed for the militia and Te Kooti was able to establish a base at Puketapu in the mountains bordering Poverty Bay. On the night of 9–10 November, Te Kooti and his Ringatū men mounted a surprise attack on a number of communities in Poverty Bay, massacring community leaders and settlers, their families, and some local Māori in revenge—or utu—for Te Kooti's banishment to the Chathams. Te Kooti remained in control of the area for a week, taking prisoners and gathering weapons and supplies. \nAs a result of the massacre at Poverty Bay, the government were now determined to deal with Te Kooti, placing a bounty for his capture and sending a force of Armed Constabulary to the region. The Armed Constabulary was a paramilitary law enforcement agency commanded by Lieutenant Colonel George Whitmore and formed New Zealand's main defence force at the time. In the interim, the militia and kūpapa—Māori warriors aligned with the government—chased Te Kooti. In December Te Kooti withdrew to a pā (hillfort) at Ngatapa, and by the end of the month was surrounded and besieged there by the Armed Constabulary and kūpapa. Te Kooti and his followers escaped during the night of 4 January 1869 although, once it was realised that he had slipped away, many of his men were captured and executed in the subsequent pursuit through the bush the next morning.\nTe Kooti found shelter with the Tūhoe iwi in the Urewera ranges and regathered over the next several weeks, mounting raids on communities to the east in March and April. In reply, a punitive invasion by 1,300 Armed Constabulary and kūpapa was launched into the Ureweras in May and although this did not result in Te Kooti's capture, he lost the support of the majority of the Tūhoe iwi. In early June, he and his Ringatū followers, which now included some Tūhoe people, moved westwards towards the Central Plateau region around Lake Taupō. His movements in this direction were detected when Te Kooti attacked a patrol of militia cavalry at Opepe on 7 June, killing nine. There was a temporary halt in the pursuit of the Ringatū, due to a change of government; the incoming Minister of Defence, Donald McLean, needed to reassess the strategy for dealing with Te Kooti following his move to the Central Plateau. \nIn the interim, Te Kooti sought the support of the Kīngitanga (Māori King Movement) for a campaign to take back land confiscated by the government but was rebuffed. He also worked to build up his following, gathering some followers among the local iwi, Ngāti Tūwharetoa, but at least some of these were as a result of duress which alienated others of the tribe.\n\n\n== Prelude ==\nBy August, McLean now resolved to deal with Te Kooti by relying primarily on a force of kūpapa. Some members of the Armed Constabulary had mutinied which meant he did not have as many as he would have liked available for engagements in the Central Plateau. The force was to be commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Thomas McDonnell, who was conversant in the Māori language. He had about 100 Armed Constabulary under his command with the balance of his force being kūpapa. McLean recruited from Te Arawa iwi, and a force of 50 kūpapa, commanded by Captain John St George and Lieutenant George Preece, duly arrived at Lake Taupō, assembling with McDonnell's Armed Constabulary at a camp at Poutu. Here they joined at least 130 warriors of Ngāti Tūwharetoa, the local iwi,  who had joined the government forces to fight against Te Kooti. Later in the month, about 230 Ngāti Kahungunu, led by Henare Tomoana and Rēnata Kawepō, from the East Coast region, also joined the hunt as did a contingent of around 120 to 160 Whanganui kūpapa commanded by Major Te Keepa Te Rangihiwinui. The latter party was the last to join the government forces, on 1 October. Having travelled some distance, McDonnell deferred taking action against Te Kooti until the Whanganui kūpapa had rested.\nAware of the build up of the forces against him, Te Kooti mounted disruptive attacks during September; one, mounted on 12 September against a force of mounted Kahungunu at Tauranga Taupō caused the loss of some of its horses and three wounded kūpapa. His own losses were three killed and several wounded. Te Kooti attacked a separate force of Kahungunu on 26 September and again incurred greater losses than the kūpapa; five killed and at least twice this number wounded.\nThrough the efforts of his scouts, McDonnell believed that Te Kooti and his followers had gathered at the village of Papakai. McDonnell now moved his force to Kotukutuku, which was at the northern side of Lake Rotoaira, to the west of Lake Taupo, departing on 2 October. Te Keepa's Wanganui contingent and the Kahungunu kūpapa were ordered to move in behind Papakai, leaving on 3 October. McDonnell intended for this force to cut off Te Kooti's escape from Papakai while his own party attacked from the opposing direction. However, the progress of the Whanganui and Kahungunu was slow and they made camp for the evening partway through the journey.\nTe Keepa's force reached Papakai on the morning of 4 October, at around 7:00am, and was joined shortly afterwards by McDonnell. The village had been abandoned and so the government forces commenced breakfast. However, about 2 miles (3.2 km) to the west, was Te Kooti's pā of Te Pōrere, clearly visible to McDonnell and his men. Scouts shortly reported that a skirmish party of Ringatū was heading towards Papakai.\n\n\n=== Te Pōrere ===\n\nTe Pōrere had been built in September, most likely by Te Kooti and his followers although it is possible that it was constructed by local Tūwharetoa. Ormond Wilson, writing in 1961, considers this doubtful, noting the source for the involvement of Tūwharetoa were the unreliable memoirs of Thomas Porter, a former officer in the Armed Constabulary. Manning Te Pōrere were some 300 or so Ringatū; about 100 were Tūwharetoa, led by the chief Te Heuheu Horonuke.\nThe defensive works at Te Pōrere consisted of three distinct fortifications. The first was the main pā, which was actually constructed in the style of a redoubt as used by the British Army on an elevated site; this was subsequently referred to as the upper redoubt. Formed with earthen walls, an entrance was provided to its western side, close to the bush line, and this offered a line of escape while the east side faced a swampy plain leading towards Lake Rotoaira. The surrounding ditches were incomplete, particularly on the north facing wall and the southeast corner. The days leading up to the fighting at Te Pōrere had been very cold and may have slowed the construction of the fortifications. A major flaw in the upper redoubt was the construction of the loop holes provided to the walls; these lacked any declination such that the defenders needed to fire their weapons over the top of the parapet when shooting at attackers sheltering in the ditches.\nThe second fortification was referred to as the lower redoubt; this was positioned on the west or left bank of the upper reaches of the Whanganui River, which flowed from the western side of Tongariro mountain. It was a complex of several trenches and while providing cover nearly all round, the position lacked depth and had a limited field of view. The last fortification was a rifle pit located on the east or right bank of the Whanganui River; some distance to the southeast from the main redoubt, it may have served as an observation post. The main portion of the rifle pit was about five feet deep, with a wall thrown up on its eastern front for protection.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nAt 10:00am, having decided to deal with the approaching Ringatū skirmishers and attack Te Pōrere, McDonnell dispersed his forces. Keepa's men was placed on the left flank along with the majority of the Armed Constabulary and about 100 of the Kahungunu kūpapa. This party, tasked with dealing with the skirmishers, was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Jasper Herrick, of the Armed Constabulary, although Keepa actually led the men in the attack. On the right flank McDonnell placed himself, the balance of the Armed Constabulary, the Te Arawa kūpapa, the Tūwharetoa party and the remaining 120 Kahungunu kūpapa. Herrick's party was to deal with the outlying rifle pit and any skirmishers therein, before pushing onto the upper redoubt. McDonnell meanwhile was to attack the lower redoubt, and then link up with Herrick at the upper redoubt.\nKeepa's Whanganui force was the first of the attackers to engage Te Kooti's skirmishers, who opened fire. Disregarding this, the Whanganui kūpapa continued to advance, holding their fire until they were closer to their opponents. The Ringatū retreated back to the upper redoubt. Some Ringatū, led by Te Heuheu Horonuke, were in the bush line adjacent the line of advance of the left flanking party and opened fire. A force was detached from the latter to deal with these Ringatū, who were actually those recruited from Tūwharetoa. They withdrew from the field and Keepa's men continued up to the upper redoubt. \nMeanwhile, St George's Te Arawa kūpapa and the Kahungunu contingent allocated to the right flank engaged with the Ringatū on the banks of the Whanganui River, pushing past the rifle pit, fording the river itself and going onto the lower redoubt. Several Ringatū were killed here before the position was cleared and the right flanking party moved up to the upper redoubt. As they moved forward, St George ordered Preece, leading the Te Arawa kūpapa, to veer away to the right and move alongside that side of the upper redoubt. St George was killed, shot through the head, as he closed up to the fortification. In subsequent years, Peita Kotuku, one of Te Kooti's lieutenants, claimed to have fired the fatal shot. \n\nThe upper redoubt, and Te Kooti, were now surrounded on three sides. However, the northern side was exposed to gunfire from Te Kooti's men disposed in the neighbouring bush which prevented the attackers from gaining a foothold there. Additionally, some Ringatū were positioned on elevated ground to the west and directed some gunfire on that side of the redoubt. Despite this the attackers were able to locate themselves in the ditch surrounding the redoubt. Once there, they were relatively safe from its defenders who were unable, due to the angle of the loop holes, to fire directly into the ditch. Instead, Te Kooti's men had to aim their weapons over the walls but this exposed them to the gunfire of the attackers. \nThe attackers blocked up the loop holes with lumps of pumice and debris and worked to dig out the underside of the walls. Before long, they ascended the walls in order to fire directly into the redoubt. The defenders began to abandon the position, making their way out via the access point on the western wall and escaping into the bush. Led by the Whanganui kūpapa, the government forces then began moving into the interior of the redoubt. Te Kooti, who was protected by a number of female followers, was wounded in the hand as he escaped; one of his fingers was severed entirely. Once the redoubt was breached, all of Te Kooti's men still present within were killed, either by being shot or bayoneted. The Ringatū were pursued into the bush and some prisoners were taken.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAt least 37 of Te Kooti's warriors were killed at Te Pōrere and over 20 prisoners were taken. The most strenuous of the defenders had been some of the women, and several had severe wounds. Only one prisoner, Te Wiripo Tohiraukura, of the Tūwharetoa iwi, was male. The Ringatū dead, 37 in total, were buried within the upper redoubt. Of the attackers, four, including St George, were killed and four wounded. One of the latter was Rēnata Kawepō, a leader of the Kahungunu, who lost an eye in hand-to-hand combat that occurred during the final stages of the fighting.\nUsing the captured Te Wiripo as a mediator, the government secured the surrender of Te Heuheu Horonuke a few days later. His argument that he only followed Te Kooti under duress was accepted on face value. Several of the Tūwharetoa women prisoners alleged that they had been hostages of Te Kooti, incentivising the men to fight. The government, keen to cut off support for Te Kooti in the Taupo area, treated Horonuke and other Tūwharetoa leniently.\nThe Battle of Te Pōrere was the last time Te Kooti fought from a prepared defensive position. It also marked the last major engagement of the New Zealand Wars. Te Kooti continued elude his kūpapa pursuers by moving westwards and in January 1870 he reached the village of Tapapa, in the south Waikato. He evaded the government's attempt to capture him there and after further skirmishes, went back into the Te Urewera ranges. For the next two years, he and his followers were hunted by kūpapa of Ngāti Porou, Te Arawa, Whanganui and Kahungunu. Eventually in May 1872 he was granted safety in the King Country. Ten years later, legislation was introduced that allowed for Maori that had fought against the government on political grounds to be pardoned. Te Kooti was granted a pardon and allowed to leave the King Country to spread his gospel, although he never returned to Poverty Bay due to opposition from the locals, both settlers and Maori.\n\n \nThe land on which the Battle of Te Pōrere took place was declared to be a National Historic Place on 18 February 1961 and is now a historic reserve administered by Heritage New Zealand. Both the upper redoubt and the lower fortification were reconstructed and are considered to be the best preserved pā site in New Zealand, although not the best example due to not being representative of a traditional pā.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n== References ==\nBelich, James (1998) [1986].

        "content": "Léa Mboua Koyassoum Doumta (born 25 November 1956) is a Central African politician and teacher.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nDoumta was born on 25 November 1956 in Bouca. She studied primary education in Batangafo and attended high school in Lycée Marie Jeanne Caron in Bangui. Afterwards, she enrolled at the teacher college of École normale d’instituteurs. She then learned English at École normale supérieure and continued her higher education at the University of Bangui.\n\n\n== Education career ==\nUpon finishing studies at École normale d’instituteurs, Doumta started her teaching career at École d’application centre\nmixte in Bangui. In 1996, Doumta taught at Lycée Marie Jeanne Caron. One year later, she moved to Berberati and served as a high school teacher at Lycée Barthélemy Boganda until 1999. After that, she returned to Bangui and was employed as the coordinator for the English Language Program at Martin Luther King Cultural Center of the United States embassy in Bangui from 1999 to 2003.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nDoumta commenced her political career by joining Femmes travailleuses de Centrafrique trade union board and became the president from 1992 to 1997. She then joined PUN and served as the party's secretary-general in 1999.\nOn 31 March 2003, Goumba appointed Doumta as the minister of family, social Affairs, and national solidarity. As the minister of social affairs, she dissolved the CAR Red Cross Society executive bodies and assigned an interim body over the chairman's mismanagement. Later, police arrested the chairman of the Red Cross Society, Francois Farra-Frond, on 12 August 2003 over the allegation of corruption in red cross donor funds. She held that position until 2 September 2004. Under the Gaombalet cabinet, Doumta served as the Minister of Justice on 2 September 2004.  However, she was designated as the PUN campaign manager for the 2005 Central African general election in late 2004. On 10 January 2005, Bozize dismissed Doumta as a minister of justice.\nDoté assigned Doumta as the minister of public health on public health on 19 June 2005 and served it until 31 January 2006. Subsequently, she served as the advisor of Doté from 2006 to 2007, then worked at the World Health Organization from 2007 to 2008.\nDoumta was designated as the president of PUN's Transitional Guidance Council in October 2010. During the 2011 Central African general election, she and her party endorsed Bozizé's presidential candidacy.\nIn April 2013, Doumta was elected Vice President of the National Transitional Council (CNT). She then served as acting president of CNT in January 2014. She was one of the signatories of the Catholic Church Community of Sant’Egidio's agreement for national reconciliation in the CAR on 27 February 2015 in Rome.\nAnti-balaka militias kidnapped Doumta after returning from a funeral on 18 October 2015. Subsequently, Doumta tried to negotiate her release with the abductor for more than two hours. Later, Anti-balaka released Doumta with a list of demands to the government. In 2020, Doumta became the coordinator of the pro-Touadera campaign group, Bè Oko.\nOn 24 June 2021, Dondra appointed Doumta as the minister of commerce and industry. Although she was a minister, she opposed the constitution reform proposal during the 2023 Central African constitutional referendum campaign due to the flaws and lack of consultation. Due to her dissent views on the constitution reform, pro-Touadera supporters called for her resignation from the ministerial position. In September 2023, she was reelected as the national coordinator of Awlyn Centrafrique. She stepped down as the minister of commerce and industry on 5 January 2024 and was replaced by Thierry Patrick Akoloza.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBradshaw, Richard; Rius, Juan Fandos (2016).

        "content": "The Geographical Society of Lima (Spanish: Sociedad Geográfica de Lima, SGL) is a scientific institution and geographical society based in Lima, Peru, founded in 1888. It has a library of ancient works and publishes works of geographical significance. It was founded with the purpose of collecting materials to support the defense of territorial rights disputed by neighbouring countries, something of great importance at the time of its foundation, and currently studies national geography and natural resources, determining the best routes for the construction of land roads and promoting immigration, as well as forming and preserving a geographical library, and maintaining correspondence with analogous societies in the world. It awards decorations to those who make significant contributions to the knowledge of the reality of Peru.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was created by supreme decree of February 22, 1888, given by the first government of Andrés Avelino Cáceres. This, in one of his messages to the National Congress, stated:\n\nIn order to achieve goals of obvious importance, the Government has organized a geographical society destined to constitute a center of useful enlightenment for the country, which will contribute not only to administrative efficiency and regularity with the study of the appropriate demarcation of the republic, but to also seek the necessary and fruitful flow of immigration, exhibiting with the testimony of respectable authority, the exuberant riches of our extensive and varied territory...\nThe newspaper El Comercio, in its edition of February 24, 1888, outlined the importance of its foundation:\n\nThe decree of the 22nd fills a need that has been claimed for a long time; Its importance is proven by more than one treaty that Peru has concluded with neighboring states, in which the incredible ignorance of our signatory ministers has caused the country to lose vast and rich territories for not having been aware of the limits of the Republic.\nIt was Luis Carranza, a prominent doctor, journalist and politician from Ayacucho, who promoted its creation, being its second director, a position he held for ten years.\nAmong its founding members were illustrious personalities such as Eduardo de Habich, Antonio Raimondi, Ernest Malinowski, Camilo Carrillo, Pedro Paz Soldán y Unanue, Aurelio García y García, Modesto Basadre, Guillermo Billinghurst, José Granda Esquivel, Ernst Middendorf, José Toribio Polo, Teodorico Olaechea, among others. Ex officio members were the senior officer of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the director of the School of Engineers, the general director of Telegraphs, the director of the Naval School and the professor of Geography of the Guadalupe School.\nIt emerged as dependent on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its statutes were approved by supreme resolution of July 20, 1892. It operated on the upper floors of the National Library of Peru in Abancay Avenue, suffering serious damage during the fire of 1943.\nBecause at that time there were almost no scientific centres in Peru, the Society absorbed the activity of a few men of science and attracted the most select cultivators of the study of the various geographical disciplines, thus concentrating within it the most select intellectuality of the country.\n\n\n== Directors ==\nSince its founding, the Society has had well-known intellectuals from various specialties as presidents.\n\nLeonardo Pflucker y Rico (1888)\nLuis Carranza (1889–1898)\nRicardo Flores Gaviño (1898–1899)\nCounter admiral Melitón Carvajal Ambulodegui (1899–1900, 1919–1935)\nEulogio Delgado (1900–1913)\nJosé Balta Paz (1913–1918)\nManuel Montero y Tirado (1918–1919)\nHoracio H.

        "content": "Kartam Bhugtam is an upcoming Indian Hindi-language psychological thriller film, written and directed by Soham P. Shah. The film stars Shreyas Talpade and Vijay Raaz in the lead roles, while Madhoo and Aksha Pardasany play other pivotal roles. Produced by Gandhar Films & Studio, the film is set for a pan-India theatrical release on 17 May 2024 in Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam languages.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe film's title, “Kartam Bhugtam,” which translates to “what goes around, comes around,” not only encapsulates the essence of its narrative but also serves as a profound philosophical cornerstone. The story is woven around the immutable laws of karma and destiny, deeply rooted in the ancient wisdom of Vedic astrology. It is a cinematic exploration of the belief that every individual's actions—good, bad, or indifferent—inevitably shape their future. The film intricately portrays how the characters’ lives are intertwined with the cosmic dance of planetary influences, leading to a series of events that affirm the age-old Hindi adage, “Jaise karoge, waise bharoge” (Just as you sow, so shall you reap).\n\n\n== Cast ==\nShreyas Talpade\nVijay Raaz\nMadhoo\nAksha Pardasany\nGaurav Daagar\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe announcement of “Kartam Bhugtam” was made by actor Shreyas Talpade on his Instagram, expressing his excitement for his fourth release of the year.

        "content": "Platysace ericoides, commonly known as heath platysace, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae and is endemic to eastern Australia. It is a semi-prostrate to weakly erect, open shrub or subshrub with linear or elliptic to oblong leaves with white or cream-coloured flowers in compound umbels with 3 to 10 rays.\n\n\n== Description ==\nPlatysace ericoides is a semi-prostrate to weakly erect, open shrub that typically grows to a height of 10–50 cm (3.9–19.7 in) and has scaly or hairy branches. Its leaves are linear to elliptic or oblong, mostly 2.8–20 mm (0.11–0.79 in) long and 0.5–1.8 mm (0.020–0.071 in) wide on a petiole up to 0.5 mm (0.020 in) long. The flowers are borne in umbels 5–22 mm (0.20–0.87 in) wide with about 3 to 10 rays on peduncles mostly 5–15 mm (0.20–0.59 in) long with narrowly elliptic bracts up to 2.5 mm (0.098 in) wide. Each ray usually has 2 to 8 white or cream-coloured flowers. Flowering occurs from August to December and the fruit is about 2 mm (0.079 in) long and wide.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThis species was first formally described in 1827 by Kurt Polycarp Joachim Sprengel who gave it the name Trachymene ericoides from an unpublished description by Franz Sieber. Sprengel's description was published in Systema Vegetabilium. In 1939, Cecil Norman transferred the species to Platysace as P. ericoides in the Journal of Botany, British and Foreign. The specific epithet (ericoides) means \"'Erica-like\".\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nPlatysace ericoides grows in heath and woodland on sandy soil from Mittagong in New South Wales to south-east Queensland and between Moe and Orbost in Victoria.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Ushikubi Sue Ware Kiln Site (牛頸須恵器窯跡, Ushikubi Sue-ki kama ato) is an archaeological site containing a group of Nara period kilns located in the Ushikubi and Kamidairi  neighborhoods of the city of Ōnojō, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan, extending across the border into parts of Dazaifu and Kasuga. The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 2009.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nUshikubi Sue Ware Kilns were located in the southeastern part of the Fukuoka Plain, and operated from the mid-6th century to the mid-9th century. It is the largest group of Sue ware kilns in western Japan outside of the Kinki region. As a result of archaeological excavations, it was estimated that the kiln ruins were distributed in an area of about four kilometers from east-to-west and about 4.8 km from north-to-south, and there were originally about 500 kilns. The kilns were anagama-style underground kilns;  they became larger from the middle to the end of the 6th century, with many having a total length of over ten meters from the end of the 6th century to the first half of the 7th century, and from then on they became smaller. During the period when kilns were larger, many were perforated flue kilns, which were unique to the Ushikubi site and had multiple flues deep inside the firing section. Sue ware shards bearing the inscription Wadō 6 (713) were excavated from the remains of a pit dwelling and a building with buried pillar foundations, suggesting that that there was also a village for craftsmen. The types of fired vessels from the Kofun period to the first half of the Nara period were diverse, including small saucers, bottles, and jars, but by the middle of the Nara period, it seems that the kilns specialized in small ware such as saucers and plates. The distribution range of pottery from this site was limited to the area around the Fukuoka Plain during the Kofun period, but in the Nara period and early Heian period it spread across the entire northern Kyushu region.\nMore than 300 kiln traces have been excavated to date. The site is approximately 2.2 kilometers by car from Mizuki Station on the JR Kyushu Kagoshima Main Line, or 4.6 kilometers west of the Dazaifu ruins.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nŌnojō city home page (in Japanese)\nFukuoka Tourism Web (in Japanese)\nCultural Properties in Fukuoka Prefecture (in Japanese)",

        "content": "Waiongona railway station was a rural railway station on the Marton - New Plymouth Line serving the small locality of Waiongona in New Zealand's Taranaki district. Located on Mountain Road, the station was relocated from its original site  in 1893. The station closed to all traffic in 1958, though freight trains continue to pass through the station site.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe original Waiongona station was erected in 1877 as part of the new railway line between Sentry Hill and Inglewood. It was located just north of the Waiongona Stream bridge and Mountain Road level crossing (since bypassed). In 1892 it was noted that \"Waiongona station is at the foot of a 1 in 56 grade, and consists of a backshunt for six wagons. Trains stopping to shunt block the main road and a portion could be on the river bridge.\" These issues led to the closure of the station and its movement 1 mile 37 chain closer to New Plymouth. Despite a petition from local residents against the station being moved this was completed on 26 June 1893 and the old site cleared.\nThe new station was listed as having an accommodation shelter shed & passenger platform (on the roadside of the station), a cart approach to the platform, and a loading bank. A single loop was provided, originally listed as having space for 15 wagons but gradually increased in capacity until by 1911 it was recorded as having capacity for 45 wagons.\nThere was no dedicated goods shed originally provided, but in 1928 a galvanised iron shed measuring 12 feet by 8 feet was approved for transfer from Fordell station for storage of manures, etc. at Waiongona. The cost of the move was approximately £50.\nIn 1941 approval was sought from a local delivery goods loop to be provided for wagon loads of goods, as the existing loop was used for passing of trains. Due to wartime pressures, it wasn't until March 1946 that this was provided, with a twelve-wagon loop  added for local traffic.  The goods shed and loop were moved accordingly.\nUnfortunately for the station, this change did little to secure the station's future, as in November 1955 it was noted that \"Siding not used in over twelve months; goods shed not used for years.\" and in 1956 the siding and goods shed closed to goods traffic, but the station remained open for passenger, parcels, and goods traffic in small lots. The end came soon afterwards and on 13 July 1958 the station was closed for both passenger and crossing purposes. By 15 October 1959 the crossing loop had been removed.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "James Noble (1774 – 24 October 1851) was a British Royal Navy vice admiral.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nNoble was the grandson of Thomas Noble, who emigrated from Devonshire to North America, joined the Moravians, and placed his whole property, 4,000l., in the funds of the sect. Thomas's son Isaac quit the Moravians, but could only recover 1,400l., with which he bought an estate of 1,400 acres in East Jersey. He married Rachel de Joncourt, the daughter of a French Protestant, and had a large family. When the revolutionary war broke out, he took service in the royal army, and was killed in 1778. The estate was forfeited at the peace, and the widow came to England, where she was granted a pension of 100l. a year. Three only of the sons survived their childhood. Of these, the eldest, Richard, a midshipman of the Clyde frigate, was lost in La Dorade prize, in 1797; the youngest De Joncourt, also a midshipman, died of yellow fever in the West Indies. James, the second of the three, born in 1774, entered the navy in 1787, and, having served in several different ships on the home station, was in January 1793 appointed to the Bedford of 74 guns, in which he went to the Mediterranean; was landed at Toulon, with the small-arm men, and was present in the actions of 14 March and 13 July 1795. He was then moved into the Britannia, William Hotham's flagship, and on 5 October was appointed to the Agamemnon, as acting lieutenant with Commodore Horatio Nelson. The promotion was confirmed by the admiralty, to date from 9 March 1796.\nThe service of the Agamemnon at this time was particularly active and dangerous, and Noble's part in it was very distinguished. On 29 November 1795 he was landed to carry despatches to De Vins, the Austrian general, then encamped above Savona. He was taken prisoner on the way and detained for some months, when he was exchanged. He rejoined the Agamemnon at Genoa about the middle of April 1796. A few days later, 25 April, he was in command of one of the boats sent in to cut out a number of the enemy's store-ships from under the batteries at Loano. While cutting the cable of one of these vessels Noble was struck in the throat by a musket-ball. ‘It is with the greatest grief,’ Nelson reported, ‘I have to mention that Lieutenant James Noble, a most worthy and gallant officer, is, I fear, mortally wounded.’ Noble's own account of it is: ‘I was completely paralysed, and my coxswain nearly finished me by clapping a “tarnaket,” in the shape of a black silk handkerchief, on my throat to stop the loss of blood. Luckily a mate stopped me from strangulation by cutting it with his knife, to the great dismay of the coxswain, who assured him I should bleed to death. The ball was afterwards extracted on the opposite side.’\nIn June Noble followed Nelson to the Captain, and in July was placed in temporary command of a prize brig fitted out as the Vernon gunboat. In October he rejoined the Captain as Nelson's flag-lieutenant; went with Nelson to the Minerve, was severely wounded in the action with the Sabina on 20 December 1796, and on the eve of the battle of St. Vincent returned with Nelson to the Captain. In the battle he commanded a division of boarders, and, assisted by the boatswain, boarded the San Nicolas by the spritsail-yard. For this service he was promoted to be commander, 27 February 1797. On his return to England he was examined at Surgeons' Hall, and obtained a certificate that ‘his wounds from their singularity and the consequences which have attended them are equal in prejudice to the health to loss of limb.’ The report was lodged with the privy council, but, ‘as a voluntary contribution to the exigencies of the State,’ he did not then apply for a pension. Some years later, when he did apply, he was told that ‘their lordships could not reopen claims so long passed where promotion had been received during the interval.’ In March 1798 he was appointed to the command of the sea fencibles on the coast of Sussex, and on 29 April 1802 was advanced to post rank. He had no further service, and on 10 January 1837 was promoted to be rear-admiral on the retired list. On 17 August 1840 he was moved on to the active list; and on 9 November 1846 became a vice-admiral. He died in London on 24 October 1851. He was three times married, and left issue.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1895). \"Noble, James\".

Leguía entrusted the direction of the SGE to French Colonel Georges Thomas, who established the bases for a \"National Charter.\"\nIn 1938, a Map of Peru was published jointly with the Geographical Society of Lima, at a scale of 1:1,500,000, which was approved by President Oscar R. Benavides and contained the international borders, as well as the interior demarcation (supreme resolutions of November 12, 1934, and January 8, 1935). In 1944 the name of the SGE was changed to the Military Geographic Institute (Spanish: Instituto Geográfico Militar, IGM).\nBy Supreme Decree of October 10, 1957, the Military Geographic Institute (IGM) is authorized to carry out aerial photogrammetry work for the survey of the National Chart.\nThrough Legislative Decree No. 30 of 1980, the IGM was renamed the National Geographic Institute (IGN), directly dependent on the Ministry of War and with the mission of preparing and updating the National Charter and providing cartographic support to the Army and other Institutes of the Armed Forces and the entities that require it for defense and development purposes.\nBy Law No. 24654 of March 31, 1987 and Legislative Decree No. 434 of September 27, 1987, the IGN was established as a Decentralized Public Organization of the defense sector.\nOn June 13, 2000, Law 27292 of the IGN was promulgated, including its organization and functions, technical directions; (Geography, GIS, Geodesy, Photogrammetry, Cartography, Reproduction; Cartographic School; Regional Directorates). Among the complementary Transitional and Final Provisions, there appears, as in previous legal regulations, the “Obligation of public and private entities to provide information of a geographic cartographic nature, to keep the Cartographic Database updated.”\n\n\n== Chiefs ==\nLieutenant Colonel Carlos Méndez Prieto (1915–1919)\nColonel George Thomas (1921–1925)\nColonel José A.

        "content": "The Silver Train of Stockholm (Swedish: Silvertåget), also known as the the Silver Arrow (Swedish: Silverpilen), is an urban legend about a silver colored ghost train that traffics the Stockholm Metro. The legend is one of several surrounding the Stockholm Metro involving ghost phenomena. The modern railway network, which was inaugurated in 1950, has racked up several mythical urban legends over the years, especially of the horror genre, of which the silver train is the most famous.According to ethnologist Bengt af Klintberg, there is a legend where the train must have had some kind of curse on the living, as those who got on the train could not get off. This curse is retold in various urban legends and ghost stories about the silver train and has even been turned into a TV-episode in the year 2000 for the Swedish horror themed television show Spökafton, as well as a children's book in 2016 under the name Spöktåget Silverpilen (\"The Silver Arrow ghost train\") in the book series Mystiska Myter (\"Mystical Myths\"), written by Swedish author Anna Hansson.\n\n\n== Legend ==\nThe silver train is said to be an older model silver colored metro train that operates late at night when conventional metro trains have stopped running, i.e. around 3 o'clock, what is usually called the ghost hour or the hour of death. According to the legends, the train is supposed to be a train for the dead and only appears to some. Anyone who dares to get on the train is said to end up in the domain of the dead. When the doors close, the traveler is stranded and travels to the realm of the dead. Another variation says that the train never stops and continues forever. In addition to the silver color, the train is also characterized by the fact that its passengers (the deceased) have expressionless, dead eyes. According to some variants, a train filled with deceased passengers means that the victim will survive and be released. If the train is empty, it means that the train is there to pick up the victim, causing its face to become blank and stop responding to relatives.\n\nThe silver train is said to be based on the SL C5 metro train, an aluminum prototype metro train from the 1960s that was only produced in one copy (eight cars) and was never painted, hence its silver color. These legends probably arose as the C5 cars were considered to have a ghost-like sound in the tunnels and were rare in traffic, then mainly in traffic during the night. In connection with the ghost train, the C5 has also received the nickname \"the Silver Arrow\" in popular culture.\n\n\n== Kymlinge ghost station, metro station of the dead ==\nIn connection with legends about the silver train, the legend about Kymlinge metro station is often told, a metro station that was never put into service, a so-called ghost station, which consists entirely of bare concrete. The station is said to be haunted and has been popularly called \"the metro station for the dead\" or \"the ghost station where only the dead get off\", colloquially simply the \"station of the dead\". Interestingly, the name \"Kymlinge\" comes from Swedish \"kummel\", meaning burial place. According to former director of SL (the Stockholm local transit), Björn Dalborg, Stockholmers have been telling scary stories about \"Kymlinge ghost station\" for decades.In one variant of the legend, the silver train is said to have operated on the blue line and had Kymlinge as the final station where all the dead were dropped off. However, the C5 cars, which are said to be the basis for the myth of the silver train, rarely operated on the blue line.\n\n\n=== The legend of the girl ===\nA popularly retold urban legend or ghost story about the silver train and Kymlinge tells the story about a girl who had been to a disco or ditto in central Stockholm and was going to take the metro home. She got on a train but thought the passengers looked a little strange. The girl was supposed to get off at T-Centralen, but the train did not stop even though she pulled the emergency brake – she had boarded \"the Silver Arrow\". When the train finally stops and she gets off, she sees a sign in front of her – Kymlinge. She walks with her fellow passengers up the stairs where she is met by a locked door, which does not stop her fellow passengers, who continue straight through the door. The legend about the girl has two different endings: one says that a week later the girl was found dead in Ursvik's forests, i.e. in the vicinity of the Kymlinge Station, the other that she was found alive in the same place a week later, but scared out of her wits.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nyoutube.com: Äventyr i Tunnelbanan del 8: Kymlinge (spökstationen)\nyoutube.com: Spöktåget Silverpilen\nopen.spotify.com: Spårlöst - En spökresa av SL",

        "content": "Monkey See, Monkey Don't is the 13th episode of the second season of The Ren & Stimpy Show that aired on the Nickelodeon network on 13 February 1993.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nRen and Stimpy are once again hungry and homeless. Ren becomes jealous when he sees how well fed the monkeys are in a zoo, and devises a scheme where he and Stimpy will disguise themselves as monkeys. Their disguise fools the Swedish zoo keeper who tosses Ren and Stimpy into a monkey cage with Filthy the monkey. Filthy forces Ren to eat the ticks on his back. The visitors at the zoo provide Filthy with food while Stimpy receives nut shells and a Ren a rock. When the zoo keeper offers monkey chow to eat, Ren drops the disguise. Ren and Stimpy are transferred to another part of the zoo.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of Billy West\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nZoo keeper-voice of Billy West\nFilthy-voice of Billy West.\n\n\n== Production ==\nFor the season of The Ren & Stimpy Show, production was split into a \"A\" unit headed by the showrunner John Kricfalusi and a \"B\" unit headed by Bob Camp. Money See, Monkey Don't was one of the \"B\" episodes directed by Camp. The episode was set to premiere in the fall of 1992, but had fallen behind schedule by the summer of 1992 as Camp had was reported to have \"spent an irregularly long time\" in doing the storyboards for Monkey See, Monkey Don't. The firing of Kircfalusi on 21 September 1992 and the replacement of the Spümcø studio with Games Animation greatly hindered the production of Monkey See, Monkey Don't. As Kricfalusi was no longer with the show, Billy West provided the voice for Ren.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe episode met with overwhelming negative reviews and is considered to be the worse episode of the second season. The American journalist Thad Komorowski wrote the idea of Ren and Stimpy living in their own feces to obtain inedible food was \"repellant\", the jokes were unfunny and West gave a \"high pitched and grating performance\" as Ren.\n\n\n== Books ==\nDobbs, G.

Established in 1958, the museum is renowned for housing the Kensington Runestone, a controversial artifact considered by some to be evidence of pre-Columbian Viking exploration of North America.\n\n\n== Focus and Exhibits ==\nWhile the Kensington Runestone is the museum's centerpiece, the Runestone Museum offers a broader perspective on regional history. Visitors can explore exhibits on the following:\n\nNorse history and culture: Learn about the Vikings, their exploration patterns, and their impact on the region.\nNative American history: Discover the rich heritage of the First Minnesotans, the indigenous population of the area.\nEarly European settlers: Explore the lives of the first European settlers in the area and the challenges they faced.\nMinnesota's homesteading era: Gain insight into the experiences of homesteaders who shaped the state's development.\nMinnesota wildlife: Encounter a variety of exhibits showcasing the diverse wildlife of Minnesota.\nOther highlights include:\n\nThe museum features a Children's Discovery Room with interactive exhibits.\nFort Alexandria: A replica fort showcasing authentic log buildings from the 1860s-1910s.\nSnorri: A 40-foot Viking ship replica, offering a photo opportunity and a glimpse into Viking seafaring.\n\n\n== Kensington Runestone ==\n\nThe Kensington Runestone remains a subject of debate. While some believe it is a genuine Viking artifact, others view it with skepticism. There has been a drawn-out debate regarding the stone's authenticity, but since the first scientific examination in 1910, the scholarly consensus has classified it as a 19th-century hoax. Regardless, the Runestone Museum plays a role in preserving regional history and sparking conversations about exploration, cultural exchange, and the interpretation of the past.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Francisco Boavida Fernandes (1 February 1933 – 1 May 2003), known professionally as Francis Tembo, was an Indian stage actor and composer known for his work in zomnivoilo fell (folk drama) and khell tiatr productions.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nFrancisco Boavida Fernandes was born on 1 February 1933 in Benaulim, Goa, which was under Portuguese rule at the time during the Portuguese Empire. He was born into a Goan Catholic family. His father, Mariano Piedade Fernandes, worked as a piano and violin repairman and carpenter, while his mother, Maria Acençaõ Serolina Rodrigues (later known as Serolina Rodrigues), was a homemaker.\n\n\n== Career ==\nTembo, a stage-name adopted by Fernandes, became well known for his prowess in the traditional game known as \"thembiamni\" or Cup-and-ball. Thembiamni involved the use of a wooden stick resembling a hockey stick and a wooden ball. Fernandes displayed skill in both crafting the ball and stick himself, reflecting his talent as a carpenter specializing in the creation of elaborate wooden artifacts and footwear. Fernandes garnered recognition and popularity within the zomnivoilo fell (folk drama) and khell-tiatr  communities. Known for his versatility, he assumed diverse roles ranging from a bhattkar (landlord) and a Hindu man to a drunkard and a comedic character. He collaborated regularly with Konkani khell tiatr figures such as A. Moraes, a mestri (teacher), as well as Konkani playwright and theater director Patrick Dourado, Xallibai, Menino Alfonso, and later playwright Menino de Bandar. Beyond his accomplishments as a stage actor, Fernandes took on the responsibility of instructing aspiring performers in the art of fells (term used for khells in Salcete) from villages and towns such as Curtorim, Chandor, Cuncolim, and Chinchinim. Moreover, he showcased his musical talent by composing songs for his children to perform on stage and at various events. Fernandes earned distinction as a popular specialist in khell tiatr.\nFernandes gained acclaim as a stage performer and songwriter, leaving an impact on the Konkani theatrical scene. His artistic prowess extended to composing several songs that were used by his son, Peter de Benaulim. Beyond his musical contributions, Fernandes played a pivotal role in guiding his son through the challenges of stage fright, instilling confidence and dispelling fear. Acting as both mentor and teacher, Fernandes imparted his knowledge exclusively to his son, who made his debut at the tender age of four when a fellow child artist failed to appear. Known for his exacting standards and demanding nature, Fernandes granted his son the opportunity to debut in Xallibai's Modkeak Lagon (Because of Matka), a play staged in Benaulim. The success of Peter's inaugural performance left both Fernandes and onlookers astonished. Demonstrating his commitment to nurturing talent within his family, Fernandes also introduced his daughter, Comedian Joana, to the Konkani stage between the ages of five and seven in his one his zomnivhele khell tiatr production. Fernandes was as a member of the khellghodde (khell actors) group, known for their substantial impact on fell and khell tiatrs. He was noted for his regular participation in khells.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nFernandes was a carpenter by profession, he was known for his craftsmanship in creating elaborate wooden artifacts and footwear. In addition to his professional pursuits, he possessed a passion for a traditional game known as thembiamni, akin to Cup-and-ball, in which he achieved a level of expertise. His gaming skills earned him the moniker \"Thembo\" or \"Tembo,\" eventually incorporated into his stage name. Fernandes's residence served as a venue for khell practices, during which his children received instruction in the chants and verses associated with the performances. Through these sessions, he actively contributed to the preservation and transmission of cultural heritage to the younger generation.\nOn 24 July 1961, Fernandes married Severina Piedade Fernandes, a homemaker, in a ceremony held at the Benaulim church. Prior to the church wedding, the couple underwent a civil marriage registration in Margão. Their union resulted in the birth of six children: Peter de Benaulim, Maria, Comedian Joana, Maggie, Lonita, and Convy, all of whom pursued careers as tiatr and khell-tiatr artists. Fernandes and his five daughters performed together in Menino de Bandar's productions, including Laitanam Dhorlo, Uban Dilem, and Eka Disa. This artistic legacy continued through the involvement of his grandchildren, Comedian Bryan and Benzer.\nOn 1 May 2003, Fernandes died at the age of 70, within the confines of his residence in Mazilvaddo, Benaulim, Goa.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn June 2023, Fernandes received a tribute from Konkani singer Maythan in an opening song performed by Maythan and composed by Fernandes's son Peter de Benaulim during the tiatr production of Fernandes's grandson, Comedian Bryan's Mhoji Khori Maim (My Real Mother).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sharif Kunal bin Doli Sharif (born 20 April 1992), commonly known by his stage name Atu Zero, is a Malaysian actor and comedian.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMuhammad Syaiful, Sharif Kadir, and Sharif Kunal are the sons of Sharif Doli, a traditional fisherman, and they are from the Kudat town in Sabah. With only RM$ 350 per month to their name, they had to had to struggle for a living with seven siblings. The youngest of the three, Atu, has been sailing since he was six years old. He started working as a laborer for his uncle Faisal when he was 13 years old, earning between RM$5–10 per hour. In an interview with Leaderonomics, the three brothers acknowledge that they were a naughty group even as young children.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAtu founded the Zero group with his two brothers, and they made their stage debut at the 2012 Gelanggang Awesome Raja Lawak. Their father passed away in his sleep on 21 October 2012. Atu was packing to travel to Africa for a Fear Factor episode he was involved in when he got the news. He flew from Kuala Lumpur to Kudat, but his father had already been buried before he arrived. He was never able to bid his father farewell.\nThe three brothers were having a hard time, but in 2013 they got lucky when they noticed an advertising on television for Astro's reality comedy program Maharaja Lawak Mega (MLM). From that point on, the trio's popularity grew quickly, and they were able to continue competing in the MLM competition for four seasons, from 2012 to 2018. Additionally, they competed in the MLM in 2014 and won the overall championship in the reality TV competition. \nThey attempted again the next year but were unable to get to the finals. They took home half a million ringgit after winning the MLM 2014 championship. The Zero group's debut film, Lu Mafia Gua Gangster, was scheduled to premiere in Malaysia on 21 April 2016. With a new horror comedy titled Syif Malam Raya that also stars his younger brother Atu, Sharif Kadir makes a comeback in 2020. After its recent on-demand debut on Astro First, the film generated RM$3 million in revenue in just ten days of release.\nAtu issued an apology on 13 January 2020, in response to claims made by certain viewers that his attire for the MLM 2019 final caused them discomfort. Viewers complained that his form-fitting white get-up was excessively tight and exposing as he performed with his comedy troupe Zero. A comedic sketch about two astronauts finding life on Pluto was being performed by the Zero group.\nIn response to a widely shared Wikipedia entry in Malaysia on 19 October 2022, Atu stated that he has performed alongside several A-list performers, including as Ricky Martin, Bon Jovi, Blackpink, and BTS. Although he claimed not to take it seriously, he thought the comedy and inappropriate editing of Malaysians were entertaining.\nIn the VindesTepok Bulu 2023 badminton competition, Atu and Atita Haris participated. They both played badminton against Ziva Magnolya and Arya Saloka, losing to them both. Despite the fact that he did not take home the winning trophy, Atu said that he was grateful for the opportunity to perform at VindesTepok Bulu 2023. After he had just finished representing Malaysia in the tournament, Sharif and Syaiful expressed their pride in him.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn addition to having fun with their friends, they took part in a variety of school contests, including those involving religious singing (nasyid) and the playing of the kompang, a traditional Malay musical instrument, which they continue to practice for their performances to this day.\nDespite their success, Atu claimed that the brothers still follow their old habits and that not much has changed in their life since then. He added that the brothers utilise their money to support their friends and relatives in the area because not everyone has it easy. Their motivation is not fame. Actually, because of all of their help, they have what they do now.\nAtu married fashion designer Shafeeqa Johari on 8 February 2016, in her Batu Pahat, Johor, home. The closest and dearest friends and relatives were present. Prior to the Zero group's victory in the 2015 MLM competition, he met her. According to Atu, she is someone who respects his job as an actor and comedian and is not overly concerned with his degree. His wife has since became his contracting manager.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Drama ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nakueatu on Instagram",

        "content": "Charles William Paterson (1765 – 10 March 1841) was a British Royal Navy admiral.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPaterson was the son of James Paterson, a captain in the 69th regiment. He was born at Berwick in 1756. In 1765 his name was put on the books of the Shannon at Portsmouth, and in 1768 on those of the St. Antonio. His actual entry into the navy was probably in 1769, when he joined the Phœnix going out to the Guinea coast, with the broad pennant of his maternal uncle, Commodore George Anthony Tonyn. He afterwards served on the home and Newfoundland stations; in 1776 was in the Eagle, Lord Howe's flagship, on the coast of North America, and in 1777 was promoted by Howe to be lieutenant of the Stromboli, from which he was moved the next year to the Brune. In June 1779 he joined the Ardent, a 64-gun ship, which, on 17 Aug., was captured off Plymouth by the combined Franco-Spanish fleet. In April 1780 he was appointed to the Alcide of 74 guns, which joined Rodney in the West Indies in May; went to New York with him during the summer; returned to the West Indies in November, and in the following January was present at the reduction of St. Eustatius and the other Dutch islands. In February 1781 Paterson joined the Sandwich, Rodney's flagship; went home with the admiral in the Gibraltar, and returned to the West Indies with him in the Formidable. On arriving on the station in the end of February, he was appointed acting-captain of the St. Eustatius, armed ship, and on 8 April was promoted to command the Blast, in which he returned to England on the conclusion of the peace.\nIn 1793 Paterson was appointed to the Gorgon, in which he went out to the Mediterranean, where, on 20 January 1794, he was posted to the Ariadne. On the reduction of Corsica he was moved into the Melpomene, and returned to England in 1795. In 1797 he was inspecting captain of the quota men in Kircudbright and Wigtonshire, and in 1798 superintended the fitting of the Admiral de Vries, till she was turned over to the transport board. In 1800 he commanded the Montagu in the Channel, and in 1801–2 the San Fiorenzo. In 1810 he had charge of the French prisoners of war in Rochester Castle, and in 1811–12 commanded the Puissant guardship at Spithead. He was promoted to be rear-admiral on 12 August 1812, vice-admiral 12 August 1819, and admiral 10 Jan. 1837, but had no further service, and died on 10 March 1841. He married, in 1801, Jane Ellen, daughter of his first cousin, David Yeats, formerly registrar of East Florida.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1895). \"Paterson, Charles William\".

Its intention, however, calls for severe condemnation, as it has evidently been written for the purpose of ridiculing the police at a time when they most require the moral support of the community.\"\nThe Sydney Morning Herald called it \"a very funny piece, which is a skit on the police.\"\nThe Evening News reported it \"is most unmercifully denounced by the Press as immoral in tone, and utterly deficient of any humour or literary ability. Business is very quiet.\"\nThe Sydney Mail called it \"An absurd and very inappropriate extravaganza... It is not complimentary to the police, and therefore delights all their natural enemies.\"\nThe Bulletin called it a \"masterly farce.\"\n\n\n== Premise ==\n\"A Queensland bush sergeant... is brought to Victoria with two black trackers by the Government, under the idea that he is a celebrated bushranger catcher, and he chooses some other troopers to assist in the search for the Kelly gang. Of course the party aimlessly wanders about in the Strathbogie Ranges, shoot at each other, and are at length captured by the gang in the most sheepish manner. The supposed Kellys, however, get drunk when the valiant sergeant and his men overpower them, and then it appears that their prisoners are not the Kellys at all, but only a company of amateur policemen who were having a lark! The denoument is reached by the black trackers proving Irishmen in disguise.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCatching the Kellys at Ausstage",

        "content": "Jupiter was a German fishing trawler which was built in 1936. She was requisitoned by the Kriegsmarine during the Second World War. She was used as a minesweeper under the Pennant numbers M 1404 and M 4415, and later as the Vorpostenboot V 623 Jupiter. She was scuttled in 1944.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe ship was 35.76 m (117 ft 4 in) long, with a beam of 7.49 metres (24 ft 7 in). She had a depth of 3.28 m (10 ft 9 in). She was assessed at 267 GRT, 126 NRT. She was powered by a diesel engine, which had 8 cylinders of 28 centimetres (11 in) diameter by 44.9 centimetres (17+11⁄16 in) stroke. The engine was built by Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG, Köln, Germany. It was rated at 98 nhp. It drove a single screw propeller. It could propel the ship at 11 knots (20 km/h).\n\n\n== History ==\nAlmuth was built as yard number 108 by Schulte & Bruns, Emden, Germany. She was launched on 27 June 1936 and completed on 28 July. She was owned by the Dollart Heringfischerei AG, Emden. Her port of registry was Emden. She was allocated the Code Letters DGKF, and the fishing boat registration AE 79.\nOn 9 October 1939, Jupiter was requisitioned by the Kriegsmarine, serving with 14 Minensuchflotille as the minesweeper M 1404. On 22 March 1942, she was reallocated to 44 Minensuchflotille and her pennant number was changed to M 4415. On 1 January 1943, she was designated as a vorpostenboot. She was allocated to 6 Vorpostenflotille as V 623 Jupiter. On 11 August 1944, she was scuttled at Nantes, Loire-Inférieure, France, because she was unmanoeuverable.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nGröner, Erich (1993).

        "content": "A Wonderful World - The Louis Armstrong Musical is a jukebox stage musical with a book by Aurin Squire. The show features a score of music originally performed by Louis Armstrong and others, with orchestrations by Annastasia Victory and Michael O. Mitchell. The show was conceived originally by Christopher Renshaw and Andrew Delaplaine and is directed by Renshaw with choreography by Rickey Tripp.\nThe musical tells an autobiographical account of the life of jazz musician Louis Armstrong (1901–1971), from the perspective of the four wives he had during his lifetime, Daisy Parker, Lillian Hardin, Alpha Smith, and Lucille Watson. The title comes from the song What a Wonderful World, originally released in 1967 and written by Bob Thiele and George David Weiss.\nThe show is set to open on Broadway at Studio 54 on Nov 11, 2024 following previews beginning Oct 16, 2024.\n\n\n== Production history ==\n\n\n=== Miami New Drama (2020-2021) ===\nThe musical was commissioned by Michel Hausmann, artistic director of Miami New Drama. The project was developed and workshopped beginning in 2019 at Miami New Drama and was originally set to have its world premiere on March 5, 2020, running until April 5th, 2020. This production was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic and rescheduled at the end of 2021, running from December 4, 2021, until January 16, 2022. Dionne Figgins was originally cast as Daisy Parker, while Lillian Hardin was originally played by Lana Gordon. The two roles were re-cast following the pandemic.\n\n\n=== New Orleans and Chicago (2022-2023) ===\nAfter the world premiere production, the musical was taken on the road to further workshop in New Orleans at the Saenger Theatre from October 1–8, 2023 and in Chicago at the Cadillac Palace Theatre October 13, 2023 through October 29, 2023. The musical held private readings in New York City in 2022 featuring James Monroe Iglehart as Armstrong, Krystal Joy Brown as Alpha Smith, Patrice Covington as Lucille, Jennie Harney-Fleming as Lillian Hardin, and Aisha Jackson as Daisy Parker.\n\n\n=== Broadway (2024) ===\nIn February 2024, it was announced the show would transfer to Broadway later that fall, opening at Studio 54 on Nov 11, 2024 following previews beginning Oct 16, 2024.

        "content": "Sir Watkin Owen Pell (1788 – 29 December 1869) was a British Royal Navy admiral.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPell was the son of Samuel Pell of Sywell Hall, Northamptonshire, and, on the mother's side, grandson of Owen Owen of Llaneyher, Denbighshire. He entered the navy in April 1799 on board the Loire, and on 6 February 1800 lost his left leg in the capture of the French frigate Pallas, supported by a battery on one of the Seven Islands (James, iii. 6). He was consequently discharged, and remained on shore for the next two years, at the end of which time he rejoined the Loire. After serving in various ships on the home and West Indian stations, he was promoted on 11 November 1806 to be lieutenant of the Mercury frigate, then on the Newfoundland station, and afterwards in the Mediterranean, where, as first lieutenant in command of the Mercury's boats, he repeatedly distinguished himself in cutting out gunboats or small armed vessels on the coast of Spain or Italy, and on one occasion, on 1 April 1809, was severely wounded in the right arm (ib. v. 37). In August 1809 he was presented by the Patriotic Society with 80l. for the purchase of a sword, and on 29 March 1810 was promoted to the rank of commander. In the following October he was appointed to the Thunder bomb, and was during the next two years mainly employed in the defence of Cadiz. On 9 October 1813, as he was returning to England to be paid off, he fell in with and, after a sharp engagement, captured the Neptune privateer, of much superior force, for which, and other good service, he was advanced to post rank on 1 Nov. 1813. From 1814 to 1817 he commanded the Menai frigate on the coast of North America. In May 1833 he commissioned the Forte, and in her acted as senior officer on the Jamaica station till March 1837. On his return to England he was knighted by the queen, and, in accordance with the intention of William IV, was nominated a K.C.H. by the king of Hanover. In 1840 he was appointed to the Howe, and in August 1841 to be superintendent of HM Victualling Yard, Deptford, from which he was shortly after moved to be superintendent of Sheerness dockyard, and in December to be superintendent of Pembroke dockyard, where he remained till February 1845, when he was appointed a commissioner of Greenwich Hospital. He became a rear-admiral on 5 September 1848, vice-admiral on 28 December 1855, and admiral on 11 February 1861.\n\nHe died on 29 December 1869 and was buried in Charlton Cemetery in southeast London.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1895). \"Pell, Watkin Owen\".

        "content": "Situated on the Belubula River, Canowindra (pronounced  kə-NOWN-drə) is a historic township and the largest population centre in Cabonne Shire. The town is located between Orange and Cowra in the central west of New South Wales, Australia. The curving main street, Gaskill Street, is partly an urban conservation area. \n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nThe name of the town is derived from an Aboriginal language (Wiradjuri) word meaning 'a home' or 'camping place'.\n\n\n== History ==\nPrior to the arrival of Europeans to Australia, the area now known as Canowindra was occupied for tens of thousands of years by a people known as the Wiradjuri. These \"people of the three rivers\" were hunters and gatherers who exploited the resources available in the rivers and the lands, particularly the river flats.\n\n\n=== European Settlement ===\nThe first land grant of 640 acres to a European in the area was to James Collits by Governor Ralph Darling in 1829 as a reward for \"pointing out a line of road from Mt. York to Bathurst\". Subsequently, Collits' father, Pierce, was granted land adjacent to the original grant. There is some evidence that James (or the succeeding owner, Thomas Icely) named the property \"Canoundra\". Collits owned other significant tracts of land in the area, together with a store and the first hotel. A settlement slowly grew, and as early as 1844 the village (now referred to as \"Canowindra\") was the site of a government pound.\nA post office opened at Canowindra in 1847 with mail coming from Carcoar, but the village was handicapped as part of a main route to the lower Lachlan, first by the lack of a bridge and later by the construction of the railway to Orange.  The first bridge across the Belubula River at Canowindra was opened on 28 July 1875. It was replaced by the Waddell Bridge in May 1901, and by the current John Grant Bridge in 1997.\nGold has been mined at Canowindra; the Blue Jacket, Grant's Reef, Blue Maxwell, and Gospel Oak Mines, were located near the town.\n\n\n=== Bushrangers ===\nBushrangers made four significant incursions at Canowindra within the space of a year, the first of which occurred in September 1863.  Late on Saturday morning, 26 September 1863, the bushrangers John Gilbert and Ben Hall, with three other gang members (John O'Meally, Michael Burke and John Vane), arrived at Albert Rothery's 'Clifden' station at Limestone Creek, south-west of Carcoar, where they bailed up the occupants and \"partook of dinner – regaling themselves with champagne and brandy\".: 136–137  From Rothery's the bushrangers proceeded to Canowindra (after having informed Rothery of their intended destination), arriving at the township at six o'clock in the afternoon.  They firstly detained Constable Sykes, the only policeman stationed at Canowindra, and took him to Robinson's public-house.  O'Meally and Burke remained at the inn while Hall, Gilbert and Vane \"went on a foraging expedition\" to the two stores in the township, belonging to Pierce and Hilliar, taking a quantity of men's clothing and three pounds in cash.  They then adjourned to Robinson's house and ordered tea.  The publican and his wife had departed for Bathurst, leaving Robinson's sister and \"the two Miss Flanagan's in charge of the house\".  After they had eaten \"Gilbert very politely requested one of the young ladies to play him a tune on the piano\".  Later in the evening a dance was proposed, which \"continued till daylight the next morning\".  A number of the town's residents had also been brought to the public-house and it was reported that \"the night's amusement\" was \"spoken of as one of the jolliest affairs that has ever taken place in that small town\".  In the morning Hall, Vane and Burke rode to 'Bangaroo' station in search of horses, but finding none, returned to Canowindra where Gilbert informed them that troopers were camped on the opposite side of the Belubula River, now in full flood, waiting for the waters to subside.  With the exception of Burke, the bushrangers crossed the flooded stream and camped on a hill overlooking the town.  Burke crossed the next morning after the waters had dropped, after which the gang rode into \"very rough country\" to evade the police.: 139–140 \nOn Monday morning, 12 October 1863, John Gilbert, Ben Hall and John O'Meally returned to Canowindra and \"held it against all comers\" for three days and nights, \"their proceedings being characterised by a cool audacity, which has hitherto been unequalled\".  The bushrangers stuck up the stores and  public-houses in the township and established a base at William Robinson's public-house.  Gang-members guarded the approaches to the town, and anybody who made an appearance was taken into custody and brought to the hotel.  Their captives were told they must remain at the hotel, but they \"might call for whatever [they] liked at the bushrangers' expense\".  On learning of the bushrangers' incursion, the local policeman, Constable Sykes, had started for Eugowra (being unable to cross the rising Belubula River to go to Cowra).  However he was met on the road by the bushrangers and turned back.  The outlaws confiscated his firearms and handcuffs and took him to Robinson's public-house, telling him \"to go in and enjoy himself till he received further orders\".  Each dray and their horse- or bullock-teams that arrived during the three days were stopped; eventually numbering about twelve to fourteen, the teamsters were \"lodged, fed and supplied with drink, free of expense\" and no attempt was made by the bushrangers to interfere with their loads.  At one stage Gilbert purchased a bundle of cigars and threw them on one of the tables in the hotel for anyone who cared to smoke them.  A \"pile of sweetmeats\" was also provided for the enjoyment of all. \nIt was believed that the bushrangers were expecting a gold escort to arrive at the township (which never arrived).  Mid-morning on the Tuesday three landholders and businessmen from the Forbes district, Hibberson, Twaddell and Kirkpatrick, drove up to the hotel, where Ben Hall informed them they were to be detained.  As they got down from their vehicle John O'Meally saw that Kirkpatrick was carrying a revolver, and held his own weapon at Kirkpatrick's head, \"compelled him to give it up\".  \"A first-class dinner was ordered\" for the three squatters, \"and the cost of this as well as everything else called for was defrayed by the gang\".  By the third day there were about forty people detained at the hotel.  During the occupation the bushrangers only drank bottled ale and porter, insisting that the corks be drawn in their presence.  The outlaws engaged in a variety of amusements, of which target shooting was a favourite.  For those who resided in the neighbourhood wishing to visit their homes, a leave of absence was granted providing it did not exceed an hour.  The bushrangers departed on the afternoon of the third day.  That evening the bushrangers stuck up Thomas Grant's station on the Belubula River and burned it down as vengeance on the owner who had, on a previous occasion, given information to the police about their likely whereabouts.\nIn the early hours of Wednesday morning, 4 November 1863, Gilbert, Hall and O'Meally went to Robinson's public-house in Canowindra and knocked on the door.  Upon opening, the publican William Robinson \"was confronted by Ben Hall, holding two revolvers levelled at him\".  Hall asked if there were any police in the house and then the three bushrangers \"entered the bar and drank nobblers\".  They stopped for about a quarter of an hour.  When they left they took two bottles of port-wine and two of Old Tom gin, for which they offered to pay with a £5 note (but Robinson was unable to provide change for that amount).\nOn Tuesday, 21 June 1864, Ben Hall and two companions entered Pierce's store at Canowindra \"without attracting notice\".  Finding the proprietor, John Pierce, alone they bailed him up and robbed him of about ten pounds in cash as well as goods from the store.  In the belief he had further money hidden away the bushrangers burnt portions of the account books, but to no avail.  They then took him six miles into the bush and tied him to a tree, threatening him with death and urging that he must procure £300 from his brother in Carcoar.  Pierce was eventually freed when he was able to convince Hall and his men that no money could be obtained.\n\n\n== Built environment ==\n\nGaskill Street: Today the main street, Gaskill Street, has an old-world air, with its kerbside verandah posts lining the dog-leg course of what was once a bullock team track. A total of 34 buildings and features in the town and environs are listed in the New South Wales State Heritage Register including 17 in or adjacent to Gaskill Street,\nThe Swinging Bridge: In the early 20th century residents of South Canowindra then a village in Waugoola Shire, agitated for a bridge to be built at the end of Finn's Lane to give pedestrian access to the Canowindra business area, then situated in the then neighbouring Boree Shire. Eventually, a low-level footbridge financed by the two shires and local residents was completed early in 1928. The footbridge was washed away by a major flood event in 1934. In 1938 a new suspension bridge was built, locally known as the \"Swinging Bridge\". It has been modified and strengthened over the years to withstand the floods that were formerly regular occurrences in Canowindra.\nAll Saints' Anglican Church Designed by noted ecclesiastical architect, Louis Williams All Saints' is a simple brick church. It was partially constructed in 1927–8 in a modified Gothic mode, when the sanctuary, choir and nave were built. It was subsequently finished to Williams' original design in 1959. The building houses several distinctive stained glass windows including the vesica window designed by the European trained artist, William Montgomery. One window \"Jesus with the Doctors\" was made by Christian Waller and installed in the 1930s and at least two windows were made by her husband, Napier Waller.\nNoojee Lea is a homestead located some 9 km south-west of the town on the Belubula River. The lands currently occupied by the house and demesne including more than 2000 hectares of rural property along Fish Fossil Drive were originally granted to Robert Read in 1869. Since 1981 the owners are the family of the prominent businessman and \"BRW rich lister\" Charles Curran AO. There have been several iterations of the garden including a design in 2010 by a local landscaper, Sally Bourne. Subsequently, further improvements on the layout were carried out by the Melbourne landscape designer Paul Bangay in 2015. The Curran family hold an open day at the homestead each year with proceeds benefiting the Canowindra Soldiers' Memorial Hospital. In April 2021 the gardens were featured in a segment by Graham Ross on the Better Homes and Gardens television program.\nThe Big Peg Canowindra is home to one of Australia's big things located in a field just outside the town on the road to Cargo, New South Wales.\n\n\n== Modern Canowindra ==\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\nSince early days of European settlement the population of the town has grown steadily.\n\nThe State Suburb (SSC) of Canowindra (SSC 10796) completely encompasses Moorbel (SSC 12709), Nyrang Creek (SSC 13059) and nearly all of Billimari (SSC 10354). The combined population of these SSCs in 2016 was 2,673. For the 2021 census the ABS released the population data based on the 2804 Postal Area and the total population had increased to 2,832.\nCensus data for the \"Urban Centre and Locality\" which excludes Moorbel shows that between 2001 and 2016 the numbers have reduced from 1516 to 1395. However, the figures for wider area \"State Suburb (SSC)\" show a modest increase in the count from 2,126 in 2006 to 2258 in 2016.\nIn the Canowindra SSC, 88.2% of people were born in Australia and 91.5% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religion were Catholic 29.7%, Anglican 26.6%, No Religion 16.5% and Uniting Church 8.9%.\n\n\n=== Suburbs ===\nThere are two residential areas associated with the town: South Canowindra and Moorbel.\nThe \"Village of South Canowindra\" is a rural place located south of the Bellubula River.\nMoorbel is a locality about 3 km E by N of Canowindra and 4 km SW by W of South Canowindra. In February 1917, residents of Belmore petitioned the postal inspector at Parkes for a postal receiving station. Because a place named Belmore existed in Sydney, the residents submitted other names, with Moorbel finally being approved by the Department of Lands in July 1917. A local market is held at Moorbel Hall each month.\n\n\n=== Canowindra Soldiers Memorial Hospital ===\nLocated in Browns Avenue, the hospital was built as a memorial for the men of the district who served in World War I. The foundation stone was laid in 1921 and the Soldier's Memorial Hospital opened, on Peace Day 28 June 1922. Part of the Western NSW Local Health District, the hospital has a limited number of acute and nursing home beds. The hospital also serves as a centre for various health services including rehabilitation and emergency. The emergency department was redeveloped in 2017.\n\n\n=== Education ===\nThe town has three schools: a state co-educational Years 7–12 high school, Canowindra High School, a state K–6 primary school, Canowindra Public School and St Edwards Primary School, a Roman Catholic systemic K–6 primary school.\nEarly childhood education is provided by the Canowindra Pre-school Kindergarten Inc. (a registered association that commenced operations in 1958) and registered home based educators managed by Cabonne/Blayney Family Day Care Service.\n\n\n=== Service, Social and Community ===\nThere is an active Lions Club. The branch of the Country Women's Association (CWA) which meets in its own hall with modern catering facilities was founded in 1924.\nA community garden which is open to all residents and visitors is managed by a local committee.\nThe Canowindra Services & Citizens Club Ltd is a registered club providing a wide range of facilities for members and the community including a bistro and a community hall which can be hired by the public.\nThe Canowindra Garden Club organises talks and visits to gardens throughout the region raising money for charity. The club donated $6,000 to the Canowindra Soldiers Memorial Hospital in 2018.\nThe Canowindra Historical Society operates the Canowindra Historical Museum which is located in the town's main street next the Age of Fishes Museum. On display are a shepherd's hut circa 1828, Harold Boyd's complete dental surgery, a wedding gown collection from 1881 to 1982, a reconstructed wool shed, wheat harvesters collection from 1843, photo collection and the Pioneers Wall.\nCanowindra Pastoral Agricultural and Horticultural Association manages the town's showgrounds and organises the annual show which has been held since 1900.\n\n\n=== The Miracle House ===\nWhen the special support needs of a local family with triplets diagnosed with a congenital form of muscular dystrophy and restrictive lung disease were identified in 2013, residents of the town and the wider central western NSW region started fundraising with the aim, inter alia, of building a house with appropriate design features for the use of the family as well as providing ongoing support. A charity was registered in 2016 Since then cash donations and in kind have been raised with the family moving into their new house in March 2018. In 2021 following further fund raising a hydrotherapy pool was installed at the house.\n\n\n=== Culture ===\nOrganised by the Canowindra Fine Music Group, The Baroque Music Festival is an annual presentation of baroque and related music performances at various venues around the town.\nThe town's branch of the CWA presents a \"Sunday Serenade\" at All Saints Church annually which showcases local performance talent. Monies raised are used to fund music and voice scholarships for local school children.\n\n\n=== Sport and recreation ===\n\nA number of sports clubs provide facilities and organised competitions. Such sports include Rugby league (men and women's playing as Canowindra Tigers), Rugby union (Canowindra Pythons), Cricket (Canowindra Sixers), Tennis, Lawn Bowls, Squash, Golf and Swimming. For younger age groups there is a pony club which meets fortnightly at the showground and a Little Athletics centre which participates in the Central Tablelands zone.\nThe town has a council maintained sports oval with floodlighting, Tom Clyburn Oval. At the oval there are well maintained fitness stations, basketball courts and skateboarding facilities.\nA nine-hole golf course is supported by a registered club.\nCabonne Council owns and operates the swimming pool which is open from late Spring to mid Autumn.\n\n\n=== RV Friendly Town ===\nSince 2016 Canowindra has been recognised by the Campervan and Motorhome Club of Australia (CMCA) as an RV Friendly Town. Facilities for caravaners and campers include low cost camp sites, easy access to the retail area, access to water and a free user friendly waste dump point.\n\n\n=== Media ===\nRadio stations\nRadio stations with transmissions able to be received in Canowindra include-\nAM Band:\n\nABC Local Radio 549 AM\nFM Band:\n\nHit Network 105.9 FM\nTriple M - Central West 105.1 FM\nRoccy FM 99.5 FM\nABC Classic FM 102.7 FM\nABC Radio National 104.3 FM\nFM107.5 107.5 FM\nTriple J (2JJJ) 101.9 FM\nTelevision\nCanowindra receives five free-to-air television networks and their affiliates which are broadcast from nearby Mt Canobolas:\n\nABC – ABC TV, ABC TV Plus, ABC Me and ABC News\nSBS – SBS ONE, SBS Viceland, NITV, SBS Food, SBS World Movies and SBS WorldWatch\nPrime7 – Prime7, 7Two, 7mate, Ishop TV and 7flix\nSouthern Cross 10 – 10 HD, 10 Bold, 10 Peach, 10 Shake and Sky News Regional\nWIN – 9HD, 9Gem, 9Go!, 9Life and Gold\nHalf-hour long regional news bulletins are broadcast by Prime7 and WIN but Southern Cross 10 instead airs local news updates from its Hobart studios.\nSubscription television service Foxtel is available in Canowindra and the surrounding area via satellite transmission.\nInternet\nNBN FTTN internet service is available to most of the built up area of the town via a number of reseller ISPs.\n\n\n=== Wineries ===\nCanowindra is considered to be part of the Cowra wine region which is a sub-area of the Central Ranges wine zone. There are eight wineries centred on the town, some of which offer cellar door sales.\n\n\n=== Other ===\nThe Royal Hotel is on the site of another inn owned by Robinson and the plaque on the wall indicates present day understanding that this was the inn where Ben Hall's bushranging gang had their spree.\nOther notable buildings include the nursing home, the Junction Hotel, Finn's Building, the Victoria Hotel, the former Bank of NSW and the former CBC Bank. The Trading Post, a homewares shop, won the inland tourism award for 2006.\n\n\n== Ballooning ==\n\nCanowindra is also popularly known as the Ballooning Capital of Australia.\n\nIn April 1988, an endorsed bicentennial activity the \"Canowindra 88 Bicentennial Balloon Championships\" was held in the town. The 1988 event was also the Australian National Championship under the auspices of the Australian Ballooning Federation. The champion in 1988 was John Wallington. Subsequently, the 2011, 2013 and 2014 championships were also held in Canowindra.\nFrom 1995 to 2005, an event known as Marti's Balloon Fiesta was held in Canowindra. Funded in large part by Frank Hackett-Jones, it was primarily a fun event designed to bring together balloonists and spectators from local, national and international locations in a celebration of Central West hospitality and goodwill.\n\nThe Canowindra International Balloon Challenge is the largest ballooning event in Australia and takes place in Canowindra in April. In 2010, the Challenge created a local balloon event that has grown to where it now attracts pilots and balloons from around the globe to build upon the principles of Marti's Fiesta, bringing businesses together to support a week-long event of ballooning competitions and skill-based activities. The use of location-enabled (GPS), point-of-view camera technologies was combined with live-to-web broadcasts via an online streaming platform for viewers to share in the spectacle and to join in the event virtually and for free.\nA balloon glow is held as part of the event along with a local food and wine market based on the 100-mile principle where the products must be made or produced within 100 miles (160 km) of Canowindra.\nThe last Sunday of the event also features a 'key grab', where pilots test their skill in an attempt to grab a large key from the top of a 10 metres (33 ft) pole.\nThis event coincides with food and wine events which brings participation from the   greater Cabonne and surrounding districts during April each year.\nCanowindra also hosted the Australian National Balloon Championships in 2011, 2013 (awarded silver at the NSW State Tourism Awards in the Festivals and Events category) and 2014, creating a larger, more competitive event. In 2014, the event went fully international with pilots from Japan, the United States of America, Russia, Brazil and the United Kingdom competing.\nIn 2020, the Balloon Challenge was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2021 event was held as scheduled on 26 April to 1 May.\n\n\n== Fossils ==\n\n Canowindra is the site of one of the world's great fossil discoveries from the late Devonian period.  A chance discovery by a road worker in 1956 uncovered a sandstone slab packed with 114 fish fossils. This slab was from the Mandagery Sandstone, dating from the Devonian period in the Paleozoic era, more than 360-million-year-old. The \"Canowindra slab\" was removed to the Australian Museum, Sydney. The fish had been buried when trapped in a pool of water that dried up, stranding a school of armoured antiarch placoderms in the species Remigolepis walkeri and Bothriolepis yeungae. Other important fossils include Canowindra grossi (a lobe-finned crossopterygian fish), two rare juvenile arthrodire placoderms, and a species of Groenlandaspis.\nNo further fossils had been recovered until January 1993, when a trial dig under the supervision of paleontologist, Dr Alex Ritchie on the site using an excavator rediscovered the fossil stratum, where the mass mortality of fishes was preserved in detail (see Lagerstätte). Specimens can be viewed in the specially established The Age of Fishes Museum, with scientific support and funding from the Australian Museum. The Canowindra site has now been listed as part of Australia's National Heritage because of its international scientific importance.\nIn 2013 the naturalist and wildlife broadcaster Sir David Attenborough described the collection of fossils as world class. \n\nIn May 2018 work started on a $600,000 facility to house the fossil bearing rock slabs currently stored off site.\n\n\n=== State Emblem ===\nThe official NSW State Fossil Emblem is Mandageria fairfaxi. The 370 million year old fossil fish from the Canowindra Fish Bed was named as the NSW State Fossil Emblem in 2015.\n\n\n== Notable Canowindrans ==\nKath Anderson – member of New South Wales Legislative Council from 1973 to 1981 was born in and received her early education in the town.\nGeorge Douglas Bassett – (1888–1972) – NSW Legislative Council member 1932–1964.

He and his wife, Kylie Tennant, lodged at the Canowindra Hotel in Gaskill Street. It was during this time Tennant wrote her first novel \"Tiburon\" (first published in serial form in The Bulletin 1935) about the \"suspicions and mores of life in a country town\", which the author stated to have been based, in part at least, on Canowindra.

        "content": "La Planicie is a neighbourhood in La Molina District, Lima, Peru. A gated community, it is inhabited by upper-class families and considered one of the most exclusive and expensive areas of the city.\n\n\n== History ==\nDuring the War of the Pacific, a division of Orozimbo Barbosa marched through the area, then part of Ate District, at 7 a.m. on January 9, 1881, with the intent to deceive local Peruvian troops under the command of Mariano Vargas and divert them to the area to defend the city against an east-to-west attack instead of a southern advance, which actually took place. Both armies clashed at what became known as the Battle of La Rinconada de Ate, with the Peruvians being defeated and the eastern entrance to the city left wide open, although such an entrance was ultimately not used.\nThe area began to be urbanised during the 1950s. On February 6, 1962, La Molina was established as a district separate from Ate. The mining area of La Planicie de Pampa Grande was included in the district through its prior acquisition by the Aparicio-Figari Group, contributing about 50% of its territory, from which the neighbourhoods of La Planicie, El Lago and Las Lagunas were created. A number of  artificial water bodies were created with water from Rímac River taken to the new neighbourhoods, with more developments taking place on the western side of the area.\nThe area is divided into several sectors:\n\nLa Portada De La Planicie\nCountry Club La Planicie\nLa Planicie Este\nLa Alameda De La Planicie\nEl Rincón De La Planicie\nLas Lomas De La Planicie\nEl Peñón De La Planicie\nEl Oasis De La Planicie\nEl Mirador De La Planicie\n\n\n=== Recent history ===\nIn 2023, 49 Malaysians—23 men and 26 women—were released from their illegal custody in a house next to Villa María School after a raid by police, with 6 Taiwanese and 2 Peruvians, who acted as the residence's security guards, arrested.\nIn 2024, a mass grave with the remains of at least three people was discovered near the neighbourhood's eastern limit with Cieneguilla.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGated community\n\n\n== References ==",

On March 24, a music video teaser for the lead single, \"Smoothie\" was released on the SMTOWN YouTube channel. Between March 11 and 15, five short movie-like trailers, titled \"()Scape Film\" were released.\nA music video for \"Smoothie\" was also released on March 25, featuring band members playing a real-life version of Fruit Ninja. On the same day, the band held a press event in Seoul for the album.\nIn support of the EP, the band is set to go on the \"The Dream Show 3: Dream()scape\" world tour starting in May.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nDream()scape was met with critical reception by music critics. NME's Tássia Assis gave the EP three stars out of five, criticizing \"Smoothie\" as being \"a predictable, borderline-exasperating track\", while \"the rest of the album is much more creative, cohesive and enjoyable\". Cristina Jaleru of the Associated Press wrote that the EP \"comes in and out of focus through a combination of tempo changes, innovative sounds [...] and catchy yet somehow forgettable hooks\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\nCredits adapted from the EP's liner notes.\nStudio\n\nSM Wavelet Studio – recording (track 1–2, 4), digital editing (track 1)\nSM Yellow Tail Studio – recording (all tracks), digital editing (track 2, 4–5)\nSM Droplet Studio – recording (track 1, 3–6), engineered for mix (track 3)\nSM Aube Studio – recording (track 2, 6), digital editing (track 6), engineered for mix (track 6)\nDoobdoob Studio – recording (track 5–6), digital editing (track 3)\nSM Blue Cup Studio – mixing (track 1–2)\nSM Concert Hall Studio – mixing (track 3)\nSM Big Shot Studio – mixing (track 4)\nSM Blue Ocean Studio – mixing (track 5)\nSM Starlight Studio – digital editing (track 6), mixing (track 6)\n821 Sound – mastering (all tracks)\nPersonnel\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n=== Album ===\n\n\n=== Single ===\n\n\n==== Weekly charts ====\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Henry Raper (1767 – 5 April 1845) was a British Royal Navy admiral.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nRaper was born in 1767, entered the navy in February 1780, on board the Berwick, which in July joined the flag of Sir George Rodney in the West Indies. Returning in 1781, he took part in the battle on the Doggerbank on 5 Aug. Raper afterwards served in the Cambridge, and in her was at the relief of Gibraltar by Lord Howe in October 1782. He then joined the Marquis de Seignelay, with Commander John Hunter, his former shipmate in the Berwick, and remained in her till 1785. From 1785 to 1788 he was in the Salisbury, the flagship of Rear-admiral John Elliot, at Newfoundland, and afterwards in the Impregnable and Queen Charlotte in the Channel till 22 November 1790, when he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant. Through 1791 he served in the Vesuvius bomb, and in October 1793 was appointed to the Queen Charlotte, flagship of Earl Howe, to whom he acted as signal lieutenant in May and on 1 June 1794. On 4 July he was promoted to be commander, and in September, on the recommendation of Howe, was appointed signal officer on the staff of Vice-admiral de Valle, of the Portuguese squadron acting in conjunction with Howe. On resigning this post in December, he was presented with a diamond-hilted sword. In November 1795 he commanded the Racoon in the Thames; and on 1 February 1796 was posted to the Champion, a small frigate employed on the coast of Ireland and afterwards in the North Sea. In January 1798 he assisted in the seizure of a Swedish convoy, which was brought into the Downs (Schomberg, Naval Chronology, iii. 264); and in the following May took part in the attempt to destroy the locks and sluice-gates of the Bruges-Ostend Canal.p\nFrom January 1799 to September 1802 he commanded the Aimable in the West Indies (James, Nav. Hist. ii. 416). In 1810 he declined an offer of the rank of vice-admiral in the Portuguese service; and was in November appointed to the Mars, which he commanded till February 1813, on the Lisbon station and in the Baltic. Notwithstanding repeated applications he had no further employment; but was promoted in due course to be rear-admiral on 12 August 1819, vice-admiral on 22 July 1830, and admiral on 23 November 1841. He died in London on 5 April 1845, aged 78 (Gent. Mag.) He was the author of ‘A New System of Signals, by which Colours may be wholly dispensed with,’ 1828, 4to. He married, in 1798, Miss Craig, by whom he left issue. His eldest son, Henry, is separately noticed.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1886). \"Raper, Henry (1767-1845)\".

        "content": "Hiroyuki Yoshikawa (吉川弘之) is a Japanese engineer. He specialises in precision engineering and general design theory. He served as the 25th president of the University of Tokyo and the 20th and 21st president of the Science Council of Japan. He is a member of the Japan Academy and a recipient of the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred Treasure.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter graduating from the University of Tokyo (UTokyo) in 1956, he began his career as an engineer at Mitsubishi Shipbuilding. He later returned to academia, earning his PhD from UTokyo in 1964. He remained in academia and became a professor at UTokyo in 1978. He is known for advocating a new perspective in design and engineering, one that does not overly focus on achieving local optima in individual fields, but rather aims to achieve a global optimum and maximise the outcome of the work. He coined the term 'modern evils' to describe the unwanted outcomes that human efforts for a better world have created. He maintains that addressing this issue requires this new perspective, which bridges fragmented academic disciplines to synthesise new solutions and artificial objects.\n\nWhen the Second World War ended, we welcomed peace and the hope that from now on the world would use scientific knowledge to create prosperous and secure societies, and indeed we have been on that path. We have managed to live through the era of local conflicts and problems, but now that hope has been betrayed. We are now in an age of global environmental degradation and global warming, resulting in an increase in natural disasters, epidemics worldwide, intensifying conflicts and increasing inequalities, and the outbreak of horrific wars that take many lives, filling the world with countless challenges. These conundrums are diverse and their solution requires knowledge from many disciplines. To solve this situation, mankind must consider that the time has come when it is necessary to use all the knowledge it possesses. To this end, scientists must not only protect and produce knowledge in their own field, but also conduct research to use knowledge to solve difficult problems, in association with knowledge from other fields. The results of this work will provide advice to actors in society, and action to solve difficult problems will be generated, supported by many fields of study.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Fort Lebanon (known after July 1757 as Fort William) was a Pennsylvania stockade fort built in December 1755 and designed to provide protection for settlers' families during the French and Indian War. However, Native American war parties often attacked nearby farms and killed settlers, disappearing before the fort's troops could respond. The garrison was sometimes fewer than 25 men as troops were transferred for temporary duty elsewhere, meaning that the fort had little manpower for patrols or to pursue attackers. The fort was renamed Fort William in mid-1757. In May 1758, the garrison was transferred and the fort was never re-occupied.: 305–313 \n\n\n== History ==\nAt the beginning of the French and Indian War, Braddock's defeat left Pennsylvania without a professional military force. Lenape chiefs Shingas and Captain Jacobs launched dozens of Shawnee and Delaware raids against British colonial settlements, killing and capturing hundreds of colonists and destroying settlements across western and central Pennsylvania.  In late 1755, Colonel John Armstrong wrote to Governor Robert Hunter Morris: \"I am of the opinion that no other means of defense than a chain of blockhouses along or near the south side of the Kittatinny Mountains from the Susquehanna to the temporary line, can secure the lives and property of the inhabitants of this country.\": 557 \n\n\n=== Construction ===\nFort Lebanon was located just northeast of present-day Auburn, Pennsylvania, at the forks of the Schuylkill River and was intended to guard a gap in the mountains, cut by the river, that Native Americans used when travelling into Eastern Pennsylvania. Although there was no nearby township, over a hundred families had recently settled in the area and needed protection. The fort was built in three weeks under the supervision of Captain Jacob Morgan, at about the same time as Fort Northkill, in December 1755. The fort was 100 feet square with 14-foot-high stockade walls and a barracks, 30 feet by 20 feet, with a storeroom inside. A 12-foot-square gunpowder magazine had a cellar for the safe storage of powder. Two other buildings were later added for the refuge of settlers' families, and the fort was constructed so that a spring flowed through it, for fresh drinking water. Major William Parsons visited the fort in May 1756 and wrote:\n\n\"The Fort is situate in a fine Plain in the Neighbourhood of several good plantations, which are now inhabited by their respective Owners. But it is rather too much crowded with Buildings which in Case of an Attack would much hinder the Garrison. Some of those Buildings were erected for the Accomodation of Several of the poor adjacent Inhabitants last Winter but some of them are proposed to be removed for the better Accomodating of the Garrison; and when this is done there will be convenient Room within the Fort to parade and exercise the Men; and the whole will be more light and airy. Here is also great Complaint for want of Ammunition.\": 308 \nCommissary General James Young visited the fort in June 1756 and wrote:\n\n\"Fort Lebanon...is situated in a Plain, on one side is a Plantation, on the other a Barren Pretty Clear of Woods all round, only a few trees about 50 yards from the Fort, which I desired might be cut down...[The] Fort is a square of about 100 feet well staccoded with good Bastions, on one side of which is a Good Wall Piece, within is a good Guard house for the People, and two other Large houses built by the Country people who have taken refuge here, in all 6 Families.\"\nAt the time, the fort was one of the largest in the defensive chain east of the Susquehanna River.: 307 \n\n\n=== Military history ===\nThe settlements around the fort were frequently attacked during 1756. On March 6 1756, the Pennsylvania Gazette reported:\nWe hear from Berks County, that on Saturday Evening last the House and Barn of Barnabas Sictle, and the Mill of Peter Conrad, were burnt down, and the Wife of Balsar Neytong killed, and his Son, a Child of eight years old, taken Captive, by three Indians; and the next Morning Sictle's Servant informed Captain Morgan of the Mischief done at his Master's Plantation, whereupon he, with seven of his Men immediately went in Search of the Enemy, but did not meet with any.\": 307 \nAttacks continued during the summer months and farmers in the fields were vulnerable, therefore Lieutenant Colonel Conrad Weiser wrote that Captain Morgan should order:\n\n\"Six men to range from the little Fort on Northkill...and stay there if the People unite to work together in their Harvest, Six men to stay in that Fort, fifteen men are to stay in Fort Libanon, Eight men to protect the People over the Hill in harvest Time, Ten men to range constantly Eastward or Westward, and if the People return to their Plantations thereabouts, to protect those first.\": 307 \nThe garrison at Fort Lebanon was reduced to 22 when 19 men were sent to Fort Augusta in October. Fort Northkill had a garrison of only 9 men and an officer. On November 3, a child was taken, and two men were killed, and three persons were killed and three taken captive near Fort Lebanon, but the garrison was too depleted to mount an effective response, even though the fort had been built to protect the civilian population. On November 4, Captain Morgan wrote to Governor Denny, requesting reinforcements:\n\n\"That having two Forts belonging to one Company, and my Men to the Number of 19 was drafted from me, being total but Fifty-Three, Your Petitioner thinks himself too weak to be of any Service to the Frontiers, seeing the Enemy commits violent Outrages nigh the Forts; as Yesterday, the 3d of November, I found 3 Persons Scalped, and there is 3 more missing within a Mile of Fort Lebanon, & 2 Men killed and one took Captive within ½ Mile of the Fort at Northkill, and dangerous it is to keep ye Forts if their was a Superiority in Number to besiege them, So your Petitioner in Humility begs that your Honour would take ye Premising into Consideration.\"\nJames Read wrote to Colonel Weiser the same day that \"By a Gentleman who left Fort Lebanon yesterday afternoon, I hear that Sixty Women and Children have fled into it for Refuge, and several Families have come further into the Settlements, with their Household Goods & Stock.\" On November 26, ten men were transferred from Fort Augusta back to Fort Lebanon, for a total garrison of 32 soldiers.: 310  \nIn May 1757 Captain Morgan and 30 men were sent to Fort Augusta for three months, and Captain Busse at Fort Henry took command of Fort Lebanon. Colonel Weiser sent reinforcements to Fort Lebanon in June, but a sergeant and 9 men were sent in July to stand guard during a conference at Easton. Native American war parties continued to attack local farms, killing two or three people at a time and taking children. Troops sent out to pursue the attackers found only the warriors' tracks. Regular patrols failed to prevent these attacks. In July the decision was made to change the fort's name to Fort William, probably in honor of Prince William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, son of King George II.: 310–11 \nOn September 19 1757, the Hochstetler farm at the Northkill Amish Settlement was attacked and burned, and there is no record of a response from the fort. On October 1, the farms of the Spatz family and the Degler family were destroyed, and six members of the Spatz family were killed.: 23–24  Forty soldiers and two lieutenants from the Royal American Regiment were sent from Reading to protect the other farms.: 901–02  In late September, Governor Denny ordered Fort Northkill to be abandoned.: 317 \nIn January, 1758, Adjutant Jacob Kern reported that \"Capt morgans Company being 53 men and all in Good order this fort is of Little Service to the Country.\" Colonel James Burd visited Fort William in February and reported: \"Revewed the Garrison & found 53 good men but diffitient [deficient] in Dissipline...no Arms fitt for use, no Kettles nor tools.\" The decision was made soon after this to abandon the fort.: 310–11 \n\n\n=== Abandonment ===\nBy mid-1758, British forces started gaining control of the French and Indian War and Indian attacks in the Blue Mountains of Pennsylvania were subsiding. On May 11, Deputy Governor William Denny ordered the troops stationed at Fort William to join British military units as they were advancing on French outposts.: 331  By 1896 only the dried-up streambed and a depression in the earth left over from the gunpowder magazine were still visible.\n\n\n== Memorialization ==\nA stone monument with a brass plaque was erected near the site of the fort on Fort Lebanon Road in 1913 by the Mahantongo Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution of Pottsville, Pennsylvania. It was rededicated in 2023. A historical marker was placed at the intersection of Pennsylvania Route 895 and Fort Lebanon Road, in Auburn, Pennsylvania, in 1949 by the Pennsylvania Historical & Museum Commission.\n\n\n== External links ==\nMap of Fortifications on the Pennsylvania frontier in 1756\n\"French & Indian War ~ Fort Lebanon, Fort Franklin, Hawk Mt, Fort Everett,\" the Wandering Woodsman, May 2, 2021\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024 Cairns Regional Council election was held on 16 March 2024 to elect a mayor and nine councillors to the Cairns Region. The election was held as part of the statewide local elections in Queensland, Australia.\nThe Cairns Unity Team, which had held a majority on council since 2012, was defeated. Incumbent mayor Terry James was defeated by first-term councillor Amy Eden, who became the second woman to hold the role, after Val Schier.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAt the 2020 election, Unity won a third consecutive election with six councillors elected. Incumbent mayor Bob Manning was re-elected with 81.25% of the vote after preferences.\nDivision 9 councillor Brett Olds, who was elected as Independent LNP, resigned from the Liberal National Party in September 2021 in opposition to the federal Morrison government's COVID-19 vaccination restrictions.\nOn 6 December 2022, Manning announced his intention not to seek re-election at the end of his third term. Deputy mayor Terry James confirmed his intention to run and lead Unity.\nIn July 2023, Division 5 councillor Amy Eden defected from Unity to form Team Eden, announcing her decision to contest the mayoralty.\nBob Manning announced his resignation, effective immediately, on 17 November 2023. Terry James was appointed as his replacement until the 2024 election, while Jeremy Neal (also a Unity member) was appointed to replace James in Division 4.\n\n\n== Campaign ==\nDuring the campaign, James expressed support for the law and order policies of Katter's Australian Party, although stated that Cairns Unity \"do[es]n't endorse any party\" at a state level.\nTeam Eden stated their priorities were creating a \"renewed\" Cairns with a \"commitment to transparency, accountability, and engagement\". In February 2024, During the campaign, Eden was accused of plagiarising a Facebook post from Toowoomba councillor Rebecca Vonhoff. She later admitted to using passages of Vonhoff's post, and apologised.\nIn November 2023, ABC News reported that Division 4 candidate Shane Cuthbert, a former criminal and member of the unregistered Democratic Party of Queensland, had appeared in multiple online videos with a Nazi flag in 2019. Cuthbert stated that it was \"not a good look\" and he had filmed the videos in a \"shop that sold a bunch of old, cool stuff,\" and thought \"the background of the store and the colours and things like that [looked cool]\".\n\n\n== Candidates ==\nA total of 39 candidates ran for election. Incumbents are shown in bold text.\n\n\n=== Cairns Unity ===\nCairns Unity announced its candidates on 1 September 2023. Division 7 councillor Max O'Halloran chose not to seek re-election.\n\n\n=== Team Eden ===\nTeam Eden announced candidates for six out of nine wards, with Emma Gelling contesting in Division 5, held by Amy Eden.\nRestaurateur Sam Byrd was Team Eden's candidate for Division 7 until August 2023, when he withdrew citing conflict with commitments in his private life.\n\n\n=== Community First ===\nCommunity First was formed in November 2023 by members of the Greens and Socialist Alliance. The group stated they supported measures to end \"conflicts of interest and dodgy deals\" on council.\nThe group was led by mayoral candidate Denis Wall, a Greens member and former university teacher.\n\n\n=== Others ===\nPaul Taylor, a former Queensland deputy police commissioner who resigned after referring to his friend as a \"vagina whisperer\" at a policing conference in 2022, contested the mayoralty as an independent candidate.\nDivision 2 councillor Rob Pyne, who joined Socialist Alliance following the 2020 election, initially planned to retire but later chose to contest Division 5.\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n=== Mayor ===\n\n\n=== Councillors ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Craig Anthony Garland is an Australian politician and fisherman representing the Division of Braddon in the Tasmanian House of Assembly since the 2024 Tasmanian state election.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nGarland first stood as a candidate in the Division_of_Braddon in the 2018 federal by-election. Despite being a political newcomer, his self-funded grassroots campaign attracted sufficient attention that ABC news reported that it seemed that both the Labor and Liberal candidates were treating him as their main opposition. \nHis decision to direct preferences on his how-to-vote cards to the ALP candidate Justine Keay ahead of the Liberal Party's Brett Whitely saw his attract the ire of then federal senator for Tasmania Eric Abetz, who held a press conference to highlight that Garland had pleaded guilty to an assault charge in Victoria in 1994.  Garland responded that the charge related to an incident where he had stepped in to help a group of friends who were being bashed, stating \"I've got nothing to hide whatsoever. If I was faced with the same situation again and had two young blokes being chased down the road being bashed, I'd do the same thing again.\" He added that \"They're clutching at straws. Obviously, they're worried about me... They've got a minority view, they want to rule — they're an elitist, self-entitled pack of pricks.\" Senator Abetz later criticised Garland's use of offensive language in calling him a \"prick\".\nHe went on to contest the 2019 election for the federal Senate in Tasmania, polling just over 1% of the vote. \nIn 2021, Garland co-founded The Local Party (later named The Local Network) and contested the state seat of Braddon in the 2021 Tasmanian state election for the party. However, Garland left the party and contested the 2022 Australian federal election and 2024 Tasmanian state election as an independent.\nIn the 2024 state election, he received approximately 5.1% of the first preference votes in the seat of Braddon. After distribution of preferences, this rose to 11.1%, enough for him to secure the seventh seat in this electorate ahead of the fourth Liberal Party candidate. The Liberal Party finished the election with 14 seats state-wide, four short of the 18 required to form government in their own right. They secured the support of the three members of the Jacqui Lambie Network, but still required the support of at least one independent. Garland said he was looking forward to the conversation with Premier Jeremy Rockliff about potentially guaranteeing supply, saying that the Liberals were \"better off having me inside the tent pissing out than outside the tent pissing in, so we'll have some discussions shortly. I'm there for the same reason Jeremy is, so if we can put past differences aside and say, 'How can I constructively be involved in making things a bit easier and a bit better?', that's my intent.\"\n\n\n== Policies ==\nGarland is a fisherman and long-term campaigner against industrial salmon farming in the waters off Tasmania's north-west coast. Before his first election campaign in 2018, he had already led protests against salmon industry practices, such as the relocation of wild seals from salmon farming areas to native fishing areas over 400 kilometers away.\nIn the lead-up to the 2024 Tasmanian election he also ran on a platform of affordable housing and energy, while calling for a Tasmanian anti-corruption commission, similar to the IBAC in Victoria or ICAC in New South Wales.\nTogether with other independent candidates, he also signed The Forest Pledge in March 2024 in support of Tasmania following other states such as Victoria and Western Australia to end native forest logging, which he described as \"industrial scale carnage... that has gone on for decades in Tasmania.\" This was qualified by support for selective logging.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Lek-tau-phong or Ludoupong is a traditional Taiwanese mooncake. The filling is made of sweet mung bean paste stuffed with lard and shallots and baked, and sometimes a little pork is added. In recent years, due to the emphasis on health, many operators have also introduced versions that do not contain pork, lard and other ingredients, and are purely filled with mung bean puree.Traditional Taiwanese mooncakes are large in size (as big as the palm of your hand). Since the early 1980s, the industry in Fengyuan District, Taichung, known as the \"Cake Capital\" of Taiwan, has invented small mooncakes that have no lard residue and are filled with mung bean puree filling. The portion is half the size of traditional mooncakes.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Lek-tau-phong emerged in the 1940s. During the Japanese colonial period in Taiwan, Japanese confectionery culture moved into Taiwan. In order to cater to Japanese tastes, Fengyuan's local pastry manufacturers learned Japanese wagashi technology, used sweeter fillings, and reduced the size of pastries, promoting the popularity of Japanese confectionery. Fengyuan's local cake shops also developed a small mooncake with mung bean paste as the filling, called Gourd Dun Cake (葫蘆墩餅), which is the predecessor of Lek-tau-phong。.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMochi ice cream\nSnow skin mooncake\nList of Taiwanese desserts\nList of desserts\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Lek-tau-phong at Wikimedia Commons",

Two months later he was appointed to the Glory as acting-lieutenant, in which rank he was confirmed on 25 April 1807. In December he was moved to the Warspite, again with Blackwood, and in 1809 to the Téméraire in the Baltic, from which, on 30 August, he was promoted to the command of the Prometheus in the Baltic during 1810, and afterwards in the Atlantic, ranging as far as the Canary Islands, and even the West Indies. The Prometheus was an extremely dull sailer, incapable of improvement, so that any vessel she chased left her hopelessly astern; and it was owing only to the good fortune and judgment of her commander that she managed to pick up some prizes. On 7 June 1814 Robinson was advanced to post rank. From September 1817 to the end of 1820 he commanded the Favourite on the Cape of Good Hope and St. Helena station, and afterwards on the east coast of South America. In 1820 he was at Newfoundland, and was appointed by the commander-in-chief to regulate the fishery of the coast of Labrador, which he did with tact, temper, and judgment. He had no further service afloat, and in 1846 accepted the retirement, becoming in due course rear-admiral on 9 October 1849, vice-admiral on 21 October 1856, and admiral on 15 January 1862. In 1842 he was sheriff of Westmeath. In 1856 he made a yachting voyage to the Salvages, a group of barren rocks midway between Madeira and the Canaries, on one of which a vast treasure, the spoil of a Spanish galleon, was said to be buried. When in the Prometheus Robinson had been sent to look for this treasure, but met with no success. A further search was rather the excuse than the reason for revisiting the islets in the yacht, but the voyage gave him an opportunity of writing ‘Seadrift,’ a small volume of reminiscences (8vo, 1858, with portrait). He died at Southsea on 15 May 1864. He married, in 1822, Frances Elizabeth, only child of Henry Widman Wood of Rosmead, Westmeath, and had issue six sons, of whom Sir Hercules George Robert Robinson, administrator in South Africa, was created Lord Rosmead in 1896.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1897). \"Robinson, Hercules\".

        "content": "Yungay, currently known as Yungay Viejo (Spanish for \"Old Yungay\") and founded in 1540 as Santo Domingo de Yungay, was a town in Peru that served as the seat of the province of the same name in the Department of Ancash. Located 2,400 m.a.s.l., it was destroyed by a landslide that originated at the nearby Huascarán mountain due to the 1970 Ancash earthquake. 5,000 people disappeared during the event, with some 300 people surviving due to taking refuge in the local cemetery.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Spanish era ===\nYungay Valley was explored for the first time by the Spanish conquistadors in 1533 during reconnaissance expeditions from Cajamarca commanded by Hernando de Soto and Miguel de Estete. Dominican Order members founded the town and convent of Santo Domingo de Yungay on August 4, 1540, at the initiative of Father Domingo de Santo Tomás, the jurisdiction was elevated to the category of Vicariate in 1579.\nOn January 6, 1730, a violent earthquake produced an avalanche from Huandoy mountain towards a glacial lagoon, which produced an alluvium that destroyed the town of Áncash, located upstream of the river of the same name, 4 kilometres north of the current city of Yungay. On that day, the population celebrated the Epiphany and the birthday of their mayor. 1,500 people disappeared.\n\n\n=== Republican era ===\nDuring the Viceroyalty and the Republic, Yungay developed alongside Huaraz. Its inhabitants enjoyed a wealthy lifestyle as many families owned enormous areas of agricultural estates and exploited mines in the high Andean areas.\nOn January 20, 1839, the Battle of Yungay took place in which the Peru–Bolivian Confederation was dissolved with the victory of the Chilean-Peruvian Army. It was called Villa Ancachs in honour of the battle. However, this name conferred by Agustín Gamarra and which would later be designated to the department, did not catch on with the local population.\nIn 1885, rebel Indians under the guidance of Pedro Pablo Atusparía besieged Yungay, during the indigenous rebellion of Huaraz. After a local resistance that claimed the lives of hundreds of residents, the mayor was forced to surrender his population. In honor of this event, the city's public charity erected an obelisk in memory of the city's defenders in 1920.\nThe conversion into a province took place on October 28, 1904, with Law 006, after half a century of efforts. Until its disappearance in 1970, the city had approximately 5,000 inhabitants. It was the second most developed city in the department after Huaraz.\nOn 11 January 1962 an avalanche from Huascarán destroyed Ranrahirca and eight other villages in which an estimated 4,000 were killed. Yungay was saved.\n\n\n=== Disappearance ===\n\nIn 1962, two American scientists, David Bernays and Charles Sawyer, had reported seeing a massive vertical slab of rock being undermined by a glacier on mount Huascarán Norte, which threatened to fall and cause the obliteration of Yungay. According to Sawyer, when this was reported in the Expreso newspaper (27 September 1962), the government ordered them to retract or face prison, and they fled the country. Citizens were forcibly prevented from speaking of an impending disaster. Eight years later, the prediction came true.\nOn 31 May 1970, the Ancash earthquake caused a substantial part of the north side of a mountain, Nevado Huascarán, to collapse and an unstable mass of glacial ice about 800 meters across at the top of Nevado Huascarán to fall. This caused a debris avalanche, burying the town of Yungay and killing 20,000 people (400 survived). More than 50 million cubic meters of debris slid approximately 15 kilometers downhill at an angle of about 14 degrees. Speeds between 340 mph to 620 mph were achieved. Most of the survivors were in the cemetery and stadium at the time of the earthquake, as these zones were the highest in town.\nThe Peruvian government has forbidden excavation in the area where the old town of Yungay is buried, declaring it a national cemetery. The current town was rebuilt 2 km (1 mi) north of the destroyed city.\nAfter its destruction, its surviving inhabitants moved to tents until 1971, when wooden houses began to be built, with the new town eventually developing around the former town's remains.\n\n\n== See also ==\nYungay, Peru\n1970 Ancash earthquake\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Taguma Ishihatake Site (田熊石畑遺跡, Taguma Ishihatake iseki) is an archaeological site with the traces of a Yayoi period settlement located on the Taguma neighborhood of the city of Munakata, Fukuoka Prefecture on the island of Kyushu, Japan. The site was designated a National Historic Site in 2010, with the area under protection expanded in 2017.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Taguma Ishihatake Site is located in on the left bank of the middle reaches of the Tsuri River,  at an elevation of 12 meters. In 1933 a teacher at Fukuoka Prefectural Munakata Girls' High School (currently Fukuoka Prefectural High School), which was located in this area at the time, discovered the ruins, and published an article in the same year in the magazine \"Archaeology\" (Tokyo Archaeological Association).  After World War II, the area became the site of Munakata City Chuo Junior High School, but for many years the lot remained vacant. In 2008, an archaeological excavation found a grave area dating from the first half of the middle Yayoi period, and the traces of a residential area spread out to the north of the cemetery, with pit dwellings, postholes, and prehistoric storage pits. The settlement was surrounded by a ring moat estimated to be approximately 60 meters in diameter.  Although there were also remains of buildings from the Kofun period and remains of ditches and wells into the Muromachi period, the main remains are from the late early to mid-Yayoi period.\nUnusually, the building ruins are not located within the ring moat, but to the south of the survey area and east of the grave area. However, 170 earthen pots and storage pits were confirmed throughout the survey area.  The feature that attracted the most attention were nine burial mounds from the first half of the Middle Yayoi period, six of which were excavated. Grave goods included jade, jasper or glass beads and magatama.  At least one bronze weapon (bronze sword, bronze spear, bronze halberd) was unearthed from each of the six excavated graves, for a total of 15 pieces.These bronze weapons are the largest number ever found in a single tomb group from this period, suggesting the importance of this settlement. The unexcavated graves also had a reaction with a metal detector, and there is a high possibility that bronze artifacts were buried there as well.The excavated bronze weapons have been designated National Important Cultural Properties. \nAt this site, the jar coffin tombs that are characteristic of northern Kyushu are not seen. A small number of pot coffin graves can be seen in the Koga City area to the west of this site, but no pot coffin graves can be seen east of the Aoyagi River, which flows through Koga City, indicating that the boundary of the cultural area is here. Furthermore, the bronze artifacts appear to be related to the San'in region and western Seto Inland Sea, whereas the excavated pottery also shows characteristics of both the Gulf of Hibiki area to the east and the Genkai Sea area to the west, indicating that this site is located at the point of contact between eastern and western Yayoi cultures.\nCurrently, the site is maintained as an archaeological park, with reconstructions of pit dwellings and a museum. The site is approximately a 15-minute walk from Tōgō Station on the JR Kyushu Kagoshima Main Line.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCultural Properties in Fukuoka Prefecture(in Japanese)\nFukuoka Tourism Web(in Japanese)\nMunakata City home page(in Japanese)",

        "content": "Takeshi Sasaki (佐々木毅) is a Japanese political scientist who served as the 27th president of the University of Tokyo. He has served as the chairman of the Japan Academy since 2022.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nSasaki was born in a village called Senya (now Misato) in the northeastern prefecture of Akita in 1942, during the Second World War. His father, Chohachi, served as the mayor of the village. After graduating from Akita High School in 1961, he went on to study political science at the Faculty of Law, University of Tokyo (UTokyo), where he was supervised by Kanichi Fukuda (福田歓一). He earned his PhD from the same university in 1973, with a thesis entitled 'Sovereignty, Resistance, and Tolerance: Jean Bodin's Philosophy of State' (主権・抵抗権・寛容――ジャン・ボダンの国家哲学).\nIn the 1980s, he broadened his analysis to contemporary American political thought, and at the same time, he became active in the debate on contemporary Japanese politics, focusing especially on the keyword 'lateral input (横からの入力)' (American pressure).\nDuring his four-year presidency at the university from 2001, the university gained more independence but started receiving less support from the government. \n\nDuring the tenure of President Hasumi, Japanese society was beset by a financial and economic debacle of profound severity, a period marked not by the smooth and continuous march of history but by abrupt and profound disjunctions. The complacency wrought from three or four decades of economic prosperity has dulled our collective sensibility to such rudimentary truths, a malaise of the spirit that obscures even the most basic of understandings.\nHe placed this turiningpoint in the university's governance in the wider context of the country's first long-term economic and political stagnation since the Second World War and the widespread pessimism that became widespread in the country.\n\nStriving for excellence involves a commitment to being first-rate in both intellectual and practical endeavours. This quest is intrinsically linked to the continual self-improvement and potential expansion in all life's facets. Essentially, it is a profound dedication to self-cultivation beyond comparison. It embodies a mentality of self-care, whereas neglect in self-cultivation can lead to a loss of self-identity, resulting in a tendency to merely follow others without a clear sense of personal direction.\nAnalogous to this mentality he wished for first-year students, he advocated that the university itself should not be satisfied with merely being the premier academic and educational authority in the world's second-largest economy as it had been. Instead, it should stand on its own feet and commit to self-improvement, especially in the forthcoming era of the country's gradual decline.\n\n\n== References ==",

During the period of normalization, she was active in dissent, and in 1977 she signed Charter 77. In the 1980s she organized samizdat activities and seminars in the field of political philosophy. In 1991, two years after the Velvet Revolution, she was one of the three penultimate speakers of Charter 77.\nFrom 1992, Hromádková taught at Charles University. In 1994, she was one of the founders of the Democratic Union (DEU), subsequently appearing frequently in the Czech media on the subject of the Czech transformation process. In June 1996, she resigned from the position of chairperson of the DEU and since 1999, she had been without political affiliation. In 2004, she ran for the European Parliament as a candidate for the Conservative Party.\nHromadkova died on 2 April 2024, at the age of 80.\n\n\n== References ==",

The open-air department of the museum was opened in the village of Pringi in 1980. In its present form, the museum was created after several reorganizations in June 2007, when the Viimsi Museum Foundation was created. In the fall of 2009, the institution was renamed the Museum of Coastal Folk Foundation because the new name better reflected the work and history of the museum.\nThe three museums managed by the foundation complement each other, offering a broader picture of the life of Estonian coastal people. The Museum of Coastal Folk covers coastal people on the shores of the Baltic Sea from ancient times to the present day, the Viimsi Open Air Museum tells the story of the fishing village, and the Naissaar Museum presents coastal people on small islands and military history. The foundation acts as a memory institution for the people of the coast, collecting and exhibiting the cultural and historical heritage of the people of the coast in its museums.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Robert Sansum (died 1665) was a British Royal Navy vice admiral.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSansum was in 1649 master, and apparently owner, of the ship Alexander of 160 tons, which on 28 June was hired for the service of the state at 130l. a month, Sansum remaining in command of her. In 1652 he commanded the Briar, attending on the army in Scotland, and in January 1652–3, off Newcastle, captured a Flushing man-of-war of 15 guns, which he brought into the Tyne, and which was afterwards fitted for the state's service. It was at this time that a charge was laid against him of conniving at his men selling some of the ship's stores and victuals, but it seems to have been put on one side as unfounded and malicious. In June 1653 he brought into the Downs three French ships laden with tar and hemp, and in May 1654, being then in the Adventure, he took three more, on their way from Havre to Rochelle. In April 1655 he was appointed to the Portsmouth, which he commanded continuously for the next five or six years, for the protection of trade in the North Sea, though on one occasion, in the end of 1658, he stretched as far as the Canaries, and convoyed home a number of merchant vessels. In the summer of 1659 he was with the fleet off Elsinore. After the Restoration he continued serving, and in 1664 was appointed rear-admiral of the white squadron, commanded by Prince Rupert. In the following year he was still rear-admiral of the white squadron, with his flag in the Resolution, and was killed in the Battle of Lowestoft on 3 June. A grant of 500l. was ordered to be paid to his widow, Mary Sansum; but it does not appear that she received it (cf. Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1666–7 p. 406, 1667–8 p. 140). Whether Sansum left issue is not stated; but the name remained continuously in the navy list well past the middle of this century.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1897). \"Sansum, Robert\".

        "content": "Thomas Searle (29 May 1777 – 18 March 1849) was a British Royal Navy rear admiral.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSearle was the son of James Searle of Staddlescombe, Devonshire. He was born on 29 May 1777. He entered the navy in November 1789, served on the Mediterranean, home, and Newfoundland stations, and in 1796 was in the Royal George, flagship of Lord Bridport, by whose interest he was made lieutenant, on 19 Auguat, to the Incendiary fireship. In 1797 he was in the Prince, flagship of Sir Roger Curtis; in 1798, in the Nemesis frigate, on the North American station, and in 1799 commanded the Courier cutter in the North Sea. On 26 November 1799 he was made commander on the recommendation of Lord Duncan, who was greatly pleased with his activity during the year, and especially with his gallant capture of a large French privateer on 23 November From June 1800 to October 1802 he was employed in the transport service; and from July 1803 to April 1804, with the Portsmouth division of sea-fencibles. During 1804–1805–6, he commanded various small vessels off Boulogne and the north coast of France, and in December 1806 was appointed to the Grasshopper brig for service in the Mediterrean. His service in the Grasshopper was marked, even in that age, ‘as dashing in the extreme.’ On 11 December 1807, off Cape Palos, he engaged a heavily armed Spanish brig of war with two settees in company; captured the brig and drove the settees to seek safety in flight. Lord Collingwood officially reported the affair as ‘an instance of the zeal and enterprise which marked Searle's general conduct.’ On 4 April 1808, in company with the Alceste and Mercury frigates, he assisted in destroying or capturing a convoy of merchant vessels at Rota, near Cadiz, after dispersing or sinking the gunboats that escorted them, and silencing the batteries of Rota, which protected them. This last service was performed by the brig alone ‘by the extraordinary gallantry and good conduct of Captain Searle, who kept in upon the shoal to the southward of the town so near as to drive the enemy from their guns with grape from his carronades, and at the same time kept in check a division of the gunboats that had come out from Cadiz to assist the others engaged by the Alcestes and Mercury. It was a general cry in both ships: “Only look how nobly the brig behaves”’ ([Sir] Murray Maxwell to the secretary of the admiralty, Gazette, 1808, p. 570). Consequent on Maxwell's letter Searle was advanced to post rank on 28 April 1808, though the promotion did not reach him till July; and meanwhile, on 23 April, being in company with the Rapid brig, on the south coast of Portugal, he fell in with two richly laden Spanish vessels from South America, under convoy of four gunboats. The merchant ships ran in under the batteries of Faro, by which they were protected; but the brigs, having captured two of the gunboats, driven the other two on shore, and silenced the batteries, brought off the ships, with cargoes of the value of 60,000l.\nOn leaving the Grasshopper, Searle was presented by the crew with a sword of the value of eighty guineas, and shortly after, by Lloyd's, with a piece of plate worth one hundred guineas. In 1809 he commanded the Frederickstein in the Mediterranean; in 1810–11, the Elizabeth in the North Sea and at Lisbon; and in 1811–12, the Druid in the Mediterranean. On 4 June 1815 he was nominated a C.B. In 1818–21 he commanded the Hyperion frigate in the Channel (in attendance upon George IV) and in a voyage to South America, whence he brought back specie to the amount of half a million sterling. From 1836 to 1839 he was captain of the Victory, then guardship at Portsmouth; and on 9 Nov. 1846 was promoted to the rank of rear-admiral. He died at Kingston House, Portsea, on 18 March 1849, and was buried at the garrison chapel, Portsmouth. He is described as a man of middle height, strongly built, black hair, dark complexion, and remarkably handsome. He married, in November 1796, Ann, daughter of Joseph Maddock of Plymouth Dockyard and Tamerton Foliot, and by her had a large family; eight daughters survived him.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1886). \"Searle, Thomas\".

        "content": "Alma Drucilla Fleetwood Lawton (April 1921 – 24 February 1982) was a Hollywood-based, Argentine-born actress who performed in films, on television, and on old-time radio.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nBorn in Buenos Aires to English parents, Lawton appears to have spent her formative years divided primarily between Argentina and Chile. She was the younger of two children born to Alfred Edward Fleetwood Lawton, general manager of Cable & Wireless plc, and Alma Drucilla Fleetwood Lawton Sr. (aka the former Alma Drucilla Harris), herself a onetime music hall comedienne. Prior to beginning her radio career, Lawton reportedly performed in Great Britain, Australia and South America. \nEvidently, the younger Lawton inherited her mother's diminutive stature, the latter having been described in 1912 as \"the little British singing comedienne,\" while the former, at age 31, was dubbed \"a diminutive redhead,\" who, aside from her \"stage background in England and Australia,\" was \"distinguished by her height of five feet [and] weigh[t of] 92 pounds.\" On the other hand, Joe Hyams of the Citizen-News, while likewise documenting Lawton's modest dimensions, adds that \"[w]hat she lacks in size, Alma makes up for in talent, proving again that good things come in small packages.\"  \nOn November 3, 1947, Lawton made her American radio debut on Lux Radio Theatre, in \"Singapore,\" an original radio drama starring Fred MacMurray and Ava Gardner. Later that month, she costarred with Wally Maher in \"Body Off Billingsgate\" on The Whistler, and on December 8, she did another Lux episode, as part of a large ensemble supporting Robert Montgomery, Wanda Hendrix and Thomas Gomez, reprising their starring roles in Ride the Pink Horse.\nThe following spring, Lawton was tasked by Samuel Goldwyn with helping Teresa Wright achieve a reasonably authentic English accent.\n\n\n== Radio ==\n\n\n== Film and television ==\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAs of no later than April 1950, Lawton was married to fellow actor Donald Morrison. In May 1951, the couple had their names legally changed; hers, from Morrison back to Lawton, and his from Ivan Donald Morrison—which was, in fact, the Americanized version of his birth name, Isaac Morduchovitch—to Donald Albert Fleetwood Lawton. Donald Lawton died on October 18, 1990. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"Telechatter: Hollywood\". The Hollywood Reporter. September 21, 1949. p. 37. ProQuest 1286041441.

        "content": "The Kolchak Coup or Omsk Coup refers to the events of November 18, 1918, when members associated the left wing of the Directory (Provisional All-Russian Government) were arrested by members of the White Army in Omsk and the subsequent decision of the All-Russian Council of Ministers to transfer sole supreme power to the Minister of Military and Naval Affairs Alexander Kolchak.\n\n\n== Context ==\nAccording to Russian historian Valentina Dmitrievna Zimina, the events that took place in Omsk on November 18, 1918, were generally the result of the struggle between two systems of government that unfolded after the overthrow of Soviet power in the Volga region and Siberia: the Omsk non-party “right” principle, personified by the Provisional Siberian Government, and the Samara narrow-party “left” principle represented by KOMUCH.\n\n\n== Events of November 18 ==\nOn the night of November 17, an incident occurred that seemed insignificant to eyewitnesses: at a city banquet in honor of the French General Janin, three high-ranking Cossack officers - the head of the Omsk garrison, Colonel of the Siberian Cossack Army Vyacheslav Ivanovich Volkov. The Directory was irritated as Russian military sergeants demanded the Russian National Anthem \"God save the Tsar!\" to be performed. The Directory ordered the arrest of the military sergeants for “inappropriate behavior”\nWithout waiting for their arrest, Volkov then carried out the arrest of the left wing of the Provisional All-Russian Government.\nNot a single military unit came out in support of The Directory, The Directory security battalion, consisting of Socialist Revolutionaries, was proactively disarmed by military members apart of the coup. Kolchak did not personally participate in the coup, but was informed by the conspirators.\nThe next morning, The Council of Ministers met after the arrest of the Social Revolutionaries, the ministers decided on the need to assume full supreme power and then transfer it to an elected person who would lead on the principles of unity of command. The election was held on a secret ballot using closed notes and Admiral Alexander Kolchak was chosen\nKolchak was promoted to full admiral, the exercise of supreme state power was transferred to him and he was awarded the title of Supreme Ruler. All the armed forces of the state were subordinate to him. The Supreme Ruler was given the authority to take any measures, even emergency ones, to ensure the armed forces, as well as to establish civil order and legality.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Alexander Shippard (3 March 1771 – 4 April 1841) was a British Royal Navy rear admiral.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nShippard was born on 3 March 1771. He was the youngest son, by his wife, Margaret Walkinshaw, of Alexander Shippard, a purser in the navy, who was with Horatio Nelson in the Vanguard in 1798, and received a medal for the battle of the Nile, entered the navy in 1786 on board the Irresistible, bearing the broad pennant of Sir Andrew Snape Hamond. From 1788 to 1792 he successively served in the Scipio, Bellerophon, and Vengeance—all in the Channel. In 1792 he went out to Newfoundland in the Assistance, and on 23 October 1793 was promoted to be lieutenant in command of the Placentia tender. In 1795 and 1796 he was serving in the Camel storeship in the Mediterranean; in 1797 he took command of the Monarch, and cut out vessels off the Texel; subsequently, down to 1801, he was in the Montagu, for the most part in the Mediterranean, but afterwards in the West Indies. In 1801–2 he was in the Monarch in the North Sea, and in 1803 commanded the Admiral Mitchell cutter attached to the fleet under Lord Keith for the guard of the Narrow Seas. On 21 August 1803 he landed Georges Cadoudal, the Chouan chief, at Biville, between Dieppe and Tréport, and on 16 January in the following year he landed General Jean-Charles Pichegru at the same place. On 31 October 1803, being with the advanced squadron off Boulogne, he ran inshore and engaged a gun brig in charge of six sloops, some of which were armed; and, after an action of two hours and a half, during which the squadron was prevented by the contrary wind from giving him assistance, he drove the brig and one of the sloops on shore. Consequent on Keith's report of this spirited affair, Shippard received a sword of honour from the patriotic fund at Lloyd's, and was promoted to the rank of commander on 3 March 1804. He was later appointed to the Hornet in the West Indies. In 1805 he commanded the Surinam in the Mediterranean, and on 22 Jan. 1806 was advanced to post rank. In May 1807 he was appointed to the Banterer of 22 guns, which, by ‘the negligence and very culpable conduct’ of the lieutenant of the middle watch, and by ‘the culpable neglect’ of the master, was lost in the St. Lawrence on the night of 29 Oct. 1808. It appeared on the court-martial that the weather being bitterly cold the lieutenant of the watch, with the pilot's apprentice, the midshipman, and the quartermaster, went down to the gun-room to drink grog. The lieutenant was dismissed the service, and the court found that Shippard had made every possible exertion to save the ship, and afterwards to preserve the stores. He was acquitted of all blame, and was shortly afterwards appointed to the Namur, flagship of Vice-admiral Thomas Wells at the Nore. In 1812–13 he commanded the Asia in the North Sea. He had no further service, but became rear-admiral on 28 June 1838, received a pension for meritorious service, and died at Malta on 4 April 1841. Shippard married Jane, daughter of Admiral Sir John Knight, K.C.B., and left issue. Sir Sidney Shippard, K.C.M.G., formerly administrator of Bechuanaland, is his eldest grandson.\nShippard's elder brother, William Shippard (1764–1856), entered the navy on board the Medea in 1778. He was on the Nonsuch in the West Indies in 1782, and served in the battle of 9 April. In August 1797 he was at the blockade of Cadiz, under Lord St. Vincent, and in the subsequent battle, while in 1801 he served at the battle of Copenhagen. He was advanced to post rank in 1846, and died without issue on 6 July 1856.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1897). \"Shippard, Alexander\".

        "content": "Tired of Liberty is the debut album by English post-punk band The Lounge Society, released on 17 June 2022 by Speedy Wunderground, the independent label of producer Dan Carey. Upon release, Tired of Liberty received critical acclaim, with reviewers praising the album's energy and political lyrical themes. \n\n\n== Background and recording ==\nThe Lounge Society formed in Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire and were signed to producer Dan Carey when the members were in school at age fifteen. Lead Cam Davey discussed that the concept of the album was and interplay between personal and political themes, with the title reflecting both being \"tired of how liberty is manipulated or used as a weapon\". The band composed the lyrics and music for Tired of Liberty in a \"democratic\" and \"collaborative\" process involving all band members, with many members changing instruments across recordings. Recording of the album with Carey used an \"ambient room mixing\" approach in which the band moved the recording microphones further away throughout recording sessions to create a \"natural room sound\". \n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nTired of Liberty was announced in May 2022 and released on 26 August, led by the single Blood Money, accompanied by a music video directed by Alex Evans of agency Comes With Fries. A second single, No Driver, was released on 6 July 2022, a described by the band as a song about \"the human mind reaching breaking point\". The third and final single, Upheaval, was released on 3 August 2022, described as a song with a \"calmer atmosphere\" by the band.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nAccording to review aggregator Metacritic, Tired of Liberty received \"universal acclaim\" from critics upon release. Lana Williams of The Line of Best Fit commended the album's \"experimentation\" and \"musical intricacies\" as a mature progression, highlighting the lyrics and concept of the album as a \"politically veined and societally oriented shout against the world's injustices\". Describing the album as a \"ferocious and freentic\" set of songs and one of the \"year’s finest\" albums, Sputnikmusic found the band to function as a \"tight unit\", highlighting the \"boundless energy\" of percussionist Archie Dewis' performance. Drawing comparisons between tracks and bands such as Shame, These New Puritans and Orange Juice, Lisa Wright of DIY found Tired of Liberty to \"shine\" when the band \"embrace the full flood\" of their influences. Robert Davidson of Loud and Quiet found the album to have an \"undeniably, potentially game-changingly special quality\", citing the \"lacerating lyrics\", spontaneous production style and \"genuine fire\", whilst noting the sound of the band did not yet feel \"singular\". \n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nArchie Dewis, Cameron Davey, Hani Paskin Hussain, Herbie May – Performance\nDan Carey – Producer\nAlexis Smith – Engineer\nJason Mitchell – Mastering\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Second MQM insurrection refers to an insurrection by MQM, a political and militant organisation representing muhajir people which launched an insurrection in 1978 against Sindh government as well as multiple other opponents.This insurrection was suppressed by Pakistan army in the Operation Cleanup. In 1994 after military's withdrawal, MQM launched another insurrection this time more bloody than the previous one. It's intensity died down following Operation Lyari and Karachi targetted action but it's still a low level insurgency.\n\n\n== Anti state activities ==\nDuring the months of May and June in 1994, the MQM carried out a series of attacks following the army's withdrawal. These included car bombings, riots, and secret killings, leading to the deaths of around 750 people, including non-Urdu speakers and other opponents of the MQM. The conflict its most bloodiest in May 1995, when MQM militants resurfaced to the ground, and systematically ambushed government offices, police stations and police patrols using rocket launchers. Although sporadic ethnic and sectarian violence had been a permanent feature of the Karachi landscape since 1980s, the level of organization and intensity of the violence in 1995 was unprecedented. About 300 people were killed in the month of June, the death toll reached 600 deaths in two months and 2,000 deaths in a year attributed to ethnic violence, leading analysts to compare the situation to the Kashmir insurrection which were also taking place in the 1990s. On June 25, 1995, nearly 80 policemen were killed in a five-week long assault by the MQM militants, and a total of 221 security forces were killed over the year, while over 70 police operations killed over 121 \"terrorists\" believed to be MQM activists or sympathizers. By 1996 it was described as a virtual civil war between the Pakistani security forces and the MQM.\nIn 2002, the MQM assumed office in the provincial government and were elected to the city government in 2006 and 2008, while Karachi newspapers were accusing the MQM of eliminating opponents with impunity. This also involved violent, unchecked land expansion and real estate 'entrepreneurs' who were specualted to be illegally or violently occupying land driven by powerful political patrons in the MQM.\nKarachi experienced an exceptionally high level of violence in 2011 with some 800 people killed, where the MQM was widely viewed as the perpetrator of targeted killings, out of a total 1800 killings in Karachi.\n\n\n== Ethnic violence ==\nIn 2007, the 12 May Karachi riots saw the MQM party workers being accused of launching highly coordinated attacks on ANP and PPP supporters, resulting in the killings of 58 people as well as hundreds of injuries, most of whom were Pashtuns. 14 MQM workers were killed in relation during the clashes. In several occasions in 2007 and 2008, Pashtun-majority neighbourhoods were subject to violence and bombings, including coordinated attacks against Pashtun street vendors, restaurant owners and labourers, as well as \"target killings\" of ANP activists, who were accused to be involved with the Pakistani Taliban. In 2010, in response to the assassination of an MQM politician, Raza Haider, MQM-affiliated gangs gunned down close to 95 people, primarily Pashtuns as well as a minority of Sindhis and Punjabis, during the 2010 Karachi riots. In March 2011, beginning with an attack on a PPP office, 50 people were killed, mainly Pashtuns, although Urdu-speakers and Balochs were also among the killed, as well as another 18 in the month of April. These were blamed by Pashtun activists on the MQM. although MQM denied the claims. In a five-day period beginning on July 5, MQM led a protest quitting the ruling government, resulting in 114 deaths indiscriminately targeting ethnic Pashtuns regardless of their affiliation to any political party. While in mid-July, ANP politicians accused the MQM expelling 3–4,000 Pashtuns out of their neighbourhoods, the Sindhi politician Zulfiqar Mirza's comments criticizing MQM which were seen as offensive to Urdu-speakers re-ignited violence as MQM mobs went on a rampage and burned vehicles, resulting in further 14 deaths by morning, while the death toll increased to 200–318 by the end of July.  According to Fawad Chaudhry, neither PPP nor ANP had a comparable militant wing as the MQM in the past 10 years.\n\n\n== Extortion ==\nIn 2015, the MQM faced accusations of setting fire to a factory to extort money, resulting in the deaths of 258 people. MQM managed to build a successful network of businessmen and marketeers, to influence what was in effect a parallel economy in Karachi which produced organizational profits from alliances cemented with violence. Dawn reported that Karachi as an economic hub was essentially a \"hostage city\" of the MQM. MQM made use of its violent control over the economy not just through profits from extortion, but also an organized strategy of intimidation to enforce \"strikes\", pendowns, tooldowns, and shutdowns of the entire economic hub in Karachi, which essentially used the city's economy as a hostage from the rest of Pakistan, to gain political concessions from the central government and force it to accept the MQM as a ruling power.\n\n\n== Attacks on journalists ==\nIn one brazen incident in 2011, after a Pashtun journalist Wali Babar was allegedly killed by the MQM in Karachi, 4 journalists linked to the murder investigation of the dead journalist, two policemen, a police officer's brother, and an informer, were all \"methodically targeted\" by the MQM.\n\n\n== Secterian conflict ==\nThroughout 2008, about 143 killings in Karachi were attributed to clashes between MQM and the Sunni Tehreek, a Barelvi Sufi Islamist organization which recruited former MQM members. Contrarily to MQM-A, MQM-Haqiqi, a breakway faction of the MQM, united with the Sipah-i-Sahaba in Karachi in attacks against Shi'a places of worship. MQM also involved in clashed with the Taliban is which believed to profit from criminal activities such as bank robberies, thefts, car snatchings, and kidnappings for ransom.\n\n\n== Infighting ==\nMQM's violent activities were not limited to external confrontations, as internal factional violence also occurred, with party members being targeted in drive-by shootings. An instance of this occurred in the initial half of 2009 when over a hundred killings took place due to infighting between the MQM-Haqiqi and MQM factions.\n\n\n== Operation (1994–1996) ==\nDuring the tenure of Benazir Bhutto, interior minister General Naseerullah Babar conducted second operation against MQM between 1994 and 1996.\nDue to serious doubts over credibility of operation due to fake encounters, extra judicial killings and rise of killings in Karachi, Benazir Bhutto's government was dismissed by the then President of Pakistan, Farooq Ahmed Laghari.\n\n\n== Operation (1998) ==\nIn the aftermath of Hakeem Saeed's assassination, governor rule was imposed by Nawaz Sharif in the Sindh province and military operation was initiated against MQM,\n\n\n== Karachi Targeted Action (2013–present) ==\n\nDue to rise in Target killing and organised crimes of extortion, kidnapping for ransom and increased crime rate of the city, Karachi operation began by the Nawaz Sharif government in 2013 with the intention of creating peace in the city. Even though it was claimed by the interior minister Chaudhry Nisar that the intentions of the operation were apolitical, there have been systematic crackdowns against MQM. In 2015 MQM's Headquarter Nine Zero was raided twice by the paramilitary Rangers and many top officials of MQM were taken into custody. On August 22, 2016, The Headquarter was sealed and hundreds of MQM offices were bulldozed.\nMany Journalists opine that Army establishment is behind the formation of PSP and MQM-Pakistan. Many MQM officials including Prof. Zafar Arif, Kanwar Khalid Yunus, adv Sathi ishaq, Amjadullah khan, Qamar Mansur, Shahid Pasha have been in detention since four months.\nMNA Kanwar Naveed Jameed, MPA Kamran farooqui have also been arrested by the paramilitary forces.\n\n\n== Nine zero raids ==\n\nOn 11 March 2015, Pakistan Rangers carried out a raid at Nine Zero, the headquarters of MQM in Karachi as well as the party's public secretariat Khursheed Begum Memorial Hall and arrested over 100 MQM activists.\nAt least 27 suspects were presented before an anti-terrorism court. Rangers claimed that they apprehended nearly half a dozen target killers – including Faisal Mehmood, aka 'Faisal Mota', who was sentenced to death in the murder case of Geo News journalist Wali Khan Babar in 2011 and a huge quantity of arms and ammunition, walkie talkies, binoculars and other military gear used by NATO forces in Afghanistan were also seized during the raid.\nNine Zero was sealed on 23 August 2016 by the Pakistan Rangers following a hate speech delivered by MQM's leader, Altaf Hussain. In this speech, he incited the party workers to attack Pakistani media houses, which resulted in street rioting and one death in Karachi. This 2015 Rangers raid turned out to be a turning point for MQM party or some people call it a beginning of the MQM's end as a political party. A section of political analysts believe that the situation had already started worsening against the MQM, when London's Metropolitan Police arrested and detained Altaf Hussain, the party founder, in 2014 for investigation which washed away the impression that he was untouchable and safe in Britain.\nLater many leaders of MQM have been arrested by Pakistan Rangers for investigation. Since this 2015 raid, many surprising and sudden developments led to the splitting of the MQM into many factions. A group of former MQM people have formed a new party called Pak Sarzameen Party under the leadership of Syed Mustafa Kamal and Anis Kaimkhani.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMQM Militancy\nMQM insurrection (1978-1992)\nOperation Cleanup\nOperation Lyari\n\n\n== References ==",

He entered the navy in March 1799 on board the Boston on the North American station, and afterwards in the West Indies. In the autumn of 1803 he joined the Prince of Wales, flagship of Sir Robert Calder, and was present in the action of 22 July 1805. On 19 September he was appointed acting lieutenant of the Spartiate, and in her was present in the battle of Trafalgar. His commission as lieutenant was confirmed on 14 February 1806. He continued in the Spartiate off Rochefort, and afterwards in the Mediterranean till November 1809, when he was for a few months on board the Antelope, the flagship of Sir John Duckworth, and was then sent to Cadiz, where he was employed for the next three years in the defence of the town against the French flotilla; was promoted to be commander on 4 March 1811, and second in command of the English flotilla. Towards the end of 1813 he was acting captain of the San Juan, the flagship of Rear-admiral Samuel Hood Linzee at Gibraltar. He was posted on 8 December 1813, and returned to England with Linzee in the Eurotas in 1814. He had no further employment afloat, but married on 7 August 1816, Susannah, daughter of Arthur Atherley of Southampton, and seems to have settled down in that neighbourhood. He accepted the retired rank of rear-admiral on 1 October 1846, and died at Hill, near Southampton, on 19 December 1855, leaving three sons and a daughter. He was buried at Millbrook, near Southampton.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1898). \"Thomas, Frederick Jennings\".

He entered the navy in December 1787, and, having been borne on the books of various ships on the home station, joined the Lion in June 1792 with Captain Erasmus Gower, and in her made the voyage to China. On his return he was promoted, on 18 December 1794, to be a lieutenant of the Bombay Castle in the Mediterranean, one of the fleet with William Hotham in the action off Toulon on 13 July 1795, with Jervis during the blockade of Toulon in 1796, and wrecked in the Tagus in December 1796. For his exertions at that time in saving life he was commended and thanked by Vice-admiral Charles Thompson, the president of the court-martial to inquire into the loss of the ship. He was afterwards in the Acasta in the West Indies, and, having distinguished himself in several boat expeditions, was appointed to his flagship, the Sans Pareil, by Lord Hugh Seymour. After Seymour's death he was promoted by his successor, Rear-admiral Robert Montagu, on 28 April 1802, to the command of the Tisiphone sloop. He returned to England in January 1803, commanded a division of Sea Fencibles for a year, and in January 1806 was appointed to the Fly sloop, in which he was for some time in the West Indies, afterwards at the Cape of Good Hope and in the Plate River, where he had command of the flotilla intended to co-operate in the attack on Buenos Ayres, assisted in landing the army, and afterwards in re-embarking it. He was then appointed acting captain of the Fuerte, and went home in charge of convoy; but the admiralty refused to confirm the promotion, and Thompson was sent back to the Fly, which he commanded on the French coast during 1808. In 1809 he commanded a division of the flotilla in the Scheldt, and was advanced to post rank on 21 October 1810. He had no further service, but on 1 October 1846 accepted the rank of rear-admiral on the retired list, on which he rose in course of seniority to be vice-admiral on 27 May 1854, and admiral on 9 June 1860. He died on 30 January 1864, aged 88. He married in 1805 a sister of Dr. Pickering of the Military College at Sandhurst, and had a large family. One son, Thomas Pickering Thompson, died an admiral, at the age of eighty-one, in 1892.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1898). \"Thompson, John (1776-1864)\".

        "content": "In between 1972 and 1992, MQM militants launched multiple attacks against Sindh government and civilians in order to get a stronghold over Karachi. The first insurrection came to end following Operation Cleanup by Pakistan government in order to destroy the MQM stronghold in Karachi.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe ancestor of the MQM was the All Pakistan Muttahidda Students Organization (APMSO), drew its support from muhajir defectors from the heavily armed Islami Jamiat ut-Taleba(IJT). A large number of Jamaat-i-Islami members who were ethnic Muhajirs shifted their loyalties to the MQM overnight, resulting in the elimination of the former influence of the Jamaat. APMSO was radicalised when in 1985-86 the first (of the many) major clashes took place between Karachi's Muhajir and Pushtun communities. Faced by the superior firepower brought in by Afghan refugees, MQM dispatched a delegation of APMSO members to Hyderabad to meet a militant group from the Sindhi nationalist student organisation, the JSSF. APMSO were given some small firearms by PSF in the early 1980s, but it was JSSF that sold the APMSO its first large cache of AK-47s that were then used to tame the heavily armed IJT in 1987 and 1988, eventually breaking IJT's hold at KU and in various other state-owned campuses in Karachi. Admist ethnic violence, MQM's armed wings used street fighting and urban warfare as ethnic Muhajirs sought to use violence to control governing structures and appointments such as the Karachi Port Trust, Karachi Municipal Corporation and the Karachi Developmental Authority. During the MQM's stint in power in 1991, when it was part of the provincial government of Sindh, the party endorsed and participated in raids and the mass-arrests of its political rivals. Additionally, the MQM, supported by the government, was accused of operating as a mafia organization where its heavily armed militants used extortion and coercion to increase their influence.\n\n\n== Ethnic violence ==\nThe first victims of the MQM in the 1980s were primarily ethnic Pashtuns, who were generally targeted on trivial grounds which the MQM did its best to exacerbate. In 1985, a bus accident led to the death of Bushra Zaidi, by an Azad Kashmiri Punjabi driver, ignited tensions and resulted in riots in Orangi Town of Karachi. Mobs, especially university students, attacked ethnic Pashtuns and policemen, blaming the ethnic group for car accidents in the city, resulting in the killings of over 100 people. During the riots, the APMSO printed and distributed inflammatory pamphlets against the ethnic group, grounding the city to a halt and shutting down educational institutions.On September 30, 1988, hundreds of people, mostly Muhajirs, were killed in Hyderabad, Sindh in what was known as \"Black Friday\". The death toll was above 250, and the attacks are said to have been coordinated and carried out by Sindhi nationalist militants.  Unidentified gunmen opened fire on large crowds of innocent bystanders, including women and children, in Latifabad. The MQM accused Qadir Magsi and nationalists carrying out the attack.\nThe following day Sindhis were killed in ethnic rioting which killed at least 46 people. A curfew was enforced in both Karachi and Hyderabad.\nIn total over 200+ people died by MQM retaliation in the span of two days. In 1990, in a response to a police raid on MQM militants which caused the deaths of 60 Muhajirs civilians, MQM retaliatory attacks led to the deaths of 130 Sindhis.\n\n\n== Extortion ==\nThe MQM's initial source of funding relied on Zakat, voluntary donations from its members. However, in the 1990s, the MQM adopted a new approach called \"Bhatta\" or forced tax and protection money collection from commercial areas in Karachi. The party also resorted to illegal funding methods such as bank robberies in 1988. The \"Bhattia\" mafia extorted money from various professionals, including traders, businessmen, bankers, doctors, teachers, construction workers, and religious figures. This illegal funding scheme blurred the lines between politics and crime in Karachi, as some criminal groups transformed into political parties' armed wings.\n\n\n== Attacks on journalists ==\nMQM has allegedly resorted to violence against journalists and media outlets critical of the party's violent activities. Starting from 1991, the MQM engaged in destructive activities against newspapers that criticized them, with members of the group involved in looting and burning down offices. In fact, the management of Herald publications in Karachi had to suspend the distribution of the Dawn newspaper on March 21, 1991, after what it called a week-long \"terror campaign\" carried out by the MQM which involved abductions, intimidation, and attacks against newspaper vendors, distributors, and hawkers.\n\n\n== Pakka Qila Operation (26, 27 May 1990) ==\nOperation was launched by Sindh Police to target MQM workers in Pakka Qilla Hyderabad. Over 250 besieged innocent men, women, children was massacred during the operation which carried on for 275 hours before Pakistan army men eventually moved in.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On 31 October 2023, the Israeli Defense Forces struck a residential building in the Gaza Strip during its operations in Gaza in the Israel–Hamas war, killing at least 106 people, including 54 children. Human Rights Watch said there was no evidence of any military targets in the area at the time of the attack, making the strike a war crime. The incident was not public knowledge until April 2024.\n\n\n== Airstrike ==\nOn 31 October 2023, at about 2:30 pm, four aerial munitions struck the residential building known as the Engineer's Building within about 10 seconds of each other resulting in its total destruction. At the time, at least 350 people were sheltering at the building, at least 150 of which were seeking shelter after being forced to flee their homes from other parts of Gaza due to Israeli attacks. \nHatem Abdo, whose son was killed in the attack while playing football in a street near the building described the attack: \"I saw about 50 children and some young men in the street, near the southern side of the Engineer's building. I saw that the northern side of the building had been hit. Immediately the second bomb hit the southern side, which I could see clearly from my home. I saw debris from the building falling and trapping about 20 of the children, as well as some adults.\"\nAmeera Shaheen, who lost 20 relatives in the strike, said: \"There was nothing worrying at all before the attack. Almost all of us were sitting in two rooms, one for men and one for women. Some of us were laughing. We had just baked bread. There were no signs or warning or any feeling of danger. We felt safe because it was an apartment building full of civilians.\"\n\n\n== Casualties ==\nAt least 34 women, 18 men and 54 children were killed in the strike, including children who were playing football outside and residents charging phones in the first-floor grocery store. The victims came from 22 families, with the Abu Said family losing 23 relatives in the strike.\nThe total number of Palestinians killed in the attack remains unknown. Human Rights Watch identified 106 individuals killed. An investigation by Airwars identified 133 casualties, from 14 families, and stated that many bodies still buried under the rubble. The investigation estimated 133-164 casualties, of which 67-77 were children.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nA Human Rights Watch investigation published on 4 April 2024, concluded that the Israeli attack on the Engineer's Building in late October had no apparent militant target, making it an apparent war crime. The report \"found no evidence of a military target in the vicinity of the building at the time of the Israeli attack, making the strike unlawfully indiscriminate under the laws of war\", adding that upon request the Israeli authorities have provided no justification for the attack. The investigation was done in part with survivor interviews, and analyzation of satellite imagery, photos and videos published after the attack. Due to Israeli control of the Gaza border they were unable to enter Gaza and inspect first hand.\nThe Human Rights Watch called for all countries to \"suspend military assistance and arms sales to Israel so long as its forces commit systematic and widespread laws-of-war violations against Palestinian civilians with impunity\". Further adding that \"governments that continue to provide arms to the Israeli government risk complicity in war crimes.\" The group highlighted the urgency for a International Criminal Court inquiry into the serious crimes committed during the conflict.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAl-Shati refugee camp airstrike\nFlour massacre\n31 October 2023 Jabalia refugee camp airstrike\n12 February 2024 Rafah strikes\nAttacks on Palestinians evacuating Gaza City\nRefugee camp airstrikes in the Israel–Hamas war\nOutline of the Israel–Hamas war\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Metrorrey Line 5 is one of the three Metrorrey lines currently under construction of that will connect the south of Monterrey with the center of Monterrey. The system shall be ART type, electric transport vehicle without rails or catenary and virtual semi-automatic guidance. Each vehicle will have a capacity of 300 passengers. It will have an extension of approximately 10.6 kilometers. It will connect with lines 4 and 6 at the Hospital de Ginecología station, connected to line 3 at the Santa Lucía station (in front of the High Specialty Medical Unit No. 23 of the Mexican Social Security Institute).\nOn 29 April 2022, the Government of the State of Nuevo León launched an international public tender for the construction of the line. Construction work is expected to begin in November 2024 and end on August 31, 2027, according to the secretary secretary of mobility, Hernán Villarreal. However, the government was uncertain as to whether this line would be elevated or on the surface.\nOn 30 April 2023 it was officially confirmed that line 5 will be ART type with elevated, surface and hybrid sections.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn late 2021, governor of Nuevo León Samuel García announced the construction of lines 4 and 5 of the Metrorrey, then reported through a video on his social networks the place where the new metro lines will pass. The first plan presented provided that line 5 would depart from the center of Monterrey to the Mederos colony in the south of the municipality, having an original length of 8.5 kilometres (5.3 mi). However, in the publication of the tender, the length was extended to 10.6 kilometres (6.6 mi) long.\n\n\n=== Tendering process ===\nOn 9 September 2022, the technical openings were completed as part of the process of the international public tender, two consortia were registered to win the award of the construction of Lines 4, 5 and 6. One of the consortia is made up of the companies Mota-Engil Mexico and China Communications Construction Company, which also built a section of the Tren Maya. The other consortium consists of the companies Ferrovías del Bajío, Hercules Construcciones de Monterrey, Constructora Moyeda, Manufacturas Metálicas Ajax, Tordec, Inversiones Ferroviarias de México, Consega Diseño y Construcciones, and Vivienda y Construcciones.\nOn 15 September 2022 the economic proposals were submitted by both consortia and, in accordance with the timetable for the tender, on 23 September 2022 the final judgment was awarded to the winning consortium. During the presentation stage of economic proposals for construction, the Secretariat of Urban Mobility and Planning of Nuevo León rejected the proposal of the consortium composed of the Mexican companies Ferrovías del Bajío, Hércules Construcciones de Monterrey, Constructora Moyeda, Manufacturas Metálicas Ajax, Tordec, Inversiones Ferroviarias de México, Consega Diseño y Construcciones, and Vivienda y Construcciones. It was explained that in none of the above-mentioned contracts had the consortium built any light rail, metro, or monorail lines in the last 15 years. Similarly, they were made aware that braking traction systems and automatic driving systems have not been constructed or operated by any of the members of that consortium.\nOn 23 September 2022, the tender was awarded for the construction of lines 4, 5 and 6 of the Metro to the consortium formed by the Portuguese firm Mota-Engil de México and the Chinese CRRC Hong Kong. At a press conference, it was reported that CRRC will be the supplier of rolling stock, while Mota-Enegil will take care of the construction. The Secretary of Urban Mobility and Planning of Nuevo León Hernán Villarreal explained that the tender has two cost options and that both are profitable for the administration. If the 3 lines are raised, the amount will amount to 25.861 million pesos plus VAT. If line 5 is built at level, the cost would drop to 25.857 million pesos plus VAT. The consortium formed by Mota-Engil and CRRC will sign the contract on 26 September at 10:00, at the offices of the Legal Directorate of the Secretariat of Mobility and Urban Planning, located in the Administrative Tower. Regarding the possibility of building part of the transport system at the street level, during the reading of the failure of the SMPU-LPI-001-2022 tender it was specified that this topic will be defined in November 2024.\nThe construction process began on 30 September 2022 for lines 4 and 6 being monorail type. A popular consultation will be held in November 2024 to determine whether Metrorrey Line 5 will be an elevated monorail or a rapid transit line at ground level.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\nOn 30 June 2023, Governor Samuel García began the construction of Line 5. This line would be hybrid at level, with three elevated sections and will use electric trains with rubber wheels (Autonomous Rail Rapid Transit), unlike lines 4 and 6, which will have a monorail. The governor explained that the Line 5 project is based on four main axes. The first is the installation of green corridors, the second is the increase of public transport, the third is to remove the transport of cargo from Avenida Garza Sada that does not have as its destination Monterrey, and finally, the construction of the necessary infrastructure for the Line itself is contemplated.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nIn the early 2022, following the announcement of the first master plan of the new lines of the Metrorrey, neighbors of southern Monterrey demonstrated against the construction of line 5 by considering that a high viaduct will be detrimental to this whole sector, demanding that the line should be underground. They argued that lanes would be reduced on Garza Sada Avenue, businesses with the works would be closed and, in addition, aesthetically, will impact the properties and surplus value. For this reason, on 15 February 2022 they protested in front of the Palace of Government, where they delivered a letter addressed to the governor of Nuevo León, Samuel García, to listen to them and build Line 5 underground. After this, the government of Nuevo León announced that they would include in the master plan Line 6 that would travel from the center of the municipality of Monterrey to the center of the municipality of Apodaca in case the construction of Line 5 was not possible. In August 2022, García warned the opponents that the work on Line 5 will be done, since in the last months of last year the support of the vast majority of the southern neighborhoods has been quite positive and encouraging. Hence, as García said, it is only necessary to wait for further information on the project and the initiative of its construction.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMetrorrey\nMetrorrey Line 1\nMetrorrey Line 2\nMetrorrey Line 3\nMetrorrey Line 4\nEcovía\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Nicholas Tomlinson (1765 – 6 March 1847) was a British Royal Navy vice admiral.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nTomlinson was born in 1765. He was the third son of Captain Robert Tomlinson of the navy, was from March 1772 borne on the books of the Resolution, guardship at Chatham, of which his father was first lieutenant. He is said to have afterwards made two voyages to St. Helena in the Thetis, and in her to have been also on the North American station. In March 1779 he joined the Charon, with Captain John Luttrell, third earl of Carhampton; served as Luttrell's aide-de-camp in the reduction of Omoa; and, continuing in her with Captain Thomas Symonds, was present at the capture of the French privateer Comte d'Artois, and the defence and capitulation of Yorktown. He returned to England in a cartel in December 1781, and on 23 March 1782 was made lieutenant into the Bristol, which went out with convoy to the East Indies. In April 1783, shortly after the Bristol's arrival at Madras, Tomlinson was in command of a working party on board the Duke of Athol, Indiaman, when she was blown up and upwards of two hundred men and officers killed. Tomlinson escaped with his life, but was severely injured. In the Bristol he was present in the fifth action between Pierre André de Suffren and Sir Edward Hughes; in September 1784 he was appointed to the Juno, and in her returned to England in 1785. From 1786 to 1789 he served in the Savage sloop on the coast of Scotland. He is said to have been then, for a few years, in the Russian navy, and to have had command of a Russian ship of the line, which he resigned on the imminence of the war between England and France in the beginning of 1793. In July he was appointed to the Regulus, which ill-health compelled him to leave after a few months. In July 1794 he was appointed to command the Pelter gunboat, in which he ‘performed a variety of dashing exploits,’ capturing or destroying numerous vessels along the French coast, even under the protection of batteries. In July 1795 he was publicly thanked by Sir John Borlase Warren on the quarterdeck of the Pomone for his service in rescuing a party of French royalists after the failure of the attempt at Quiberon.\nOn 30 November 1795 he was promoted to the command of the Suffisante sloop, in which, in the following May, he captured the French national brig Revanche; and through the summer took or destroyed several privateers, armed vessels, storeships, and traders—a season of remarkable activity and success. The ‘Committee for Encouraging the Capture of French Privateers’ voted him a piece of plate value 50l.; so also did the ‘Court of Directors of the Royal Exchange Assurance;’ and on 12 December 1796 he was advanced to post rank. In the following year, being unable to get employment from the admiralty, he fitted out a privateer, in which he made several rich prizes; but being reported to the admiralty as having used the private signals to avoid being overhauled by ships of war, his name was summarily struck off the list on 20 November 1798. In 1801 he was permitted to serve as a volunteer in the fleet going to the Baltic with Sir Hyde Parker, and, being favourably reported on by him, was restored to his rank in the navy, with seniority, 22 September 1801.\nFrom July 1803 to June 1809 he commanded the Sea Fencibles on the coast of Essex; in the summer of 1809 he fitted out and commanded a division of fireships for the operations in the Scheldt. On returning to England he resumed the command of the Fencibles till they were broken up early in 1810. He had no further employment, but was put on the retired list of rear-admirals on 22 July 1830. He was transferred to the active list on 17 August 1840, and was promoted to be vice-admiral on 23 November 1841. He died at his house near Lewes on 6 March 1847. He married, in 1794, Elizabeth, second daughter and coheiress of Ralph Ward of Forburrows, near Colchester, and had a large family.\nTwo of Tomlinson's brothers also served in the navy, and retired with the rank of commander after the war. Philip died in 1839; Robert, at the age of eighty-five, in 1844. Each of the three brothers attained the grade of lieutenant in 1782.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1899). \"Tomlinson, Nicholas\".

        "content": "Sir Eaton Stannard Travers (1782 – 4 March 1858) was a British Royal Navy rear admiral.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nTravers was born in 1782. He was third son of John Travers of Hethyfield Grange, co. Cork. He entered the navy in September 1798 on board the Juno in the North Sea, where during the following year he was actively engaged in boat service along the coast of Holland. He was similarly employed in the West Indies during 1800–1. In March 1802 he was moved to the Elephant, and in October 1803 to the Hercule, then carrying the flag of Sir John Thomas Duckworth. In November, Duckworth remaining at Jamaica, the Hercule was attached to the squadron under Commodore Loring, blockading Cape Français. On 30 November, when the French ships agreed to surrender, Travers was with Lieutenant Nisbet Josiah Willoughby in the launch which took possession of the Clorinde after she had got on shore, and claimed to have been the chief agent in saving the ship by swimming to the shore and so making fast a hawser, by which the frigate was hauled off the rocks. In January and February 1804 he was again with Willoughby in the advance battery at the siege of Curaçoa, and was afterwards publicly thanked by the admiral for his gallantry and good conduct. On 23 September 1804 he was promoted to be lieutenant and to command the schooner Ballahou; but in February 1805, on her being ordered to Newfoundland, Travers was appointed to the Surveillante, in which again he saw some very active and sharp boat service on the Spanish Main.\nIn 1806 the Hercule returned to England, and in December Travers was appointed to the Alcmène frigate, employed on the coast of France till she was wrecked off the mouth of the Loire on 29 April 1809. He was afterwards in the Impérieuse, in the Walcheren expedition, and in 1810 in the Mediterranean, where for the next four years he was almost incessantly engaged in minor operations against the enemy's coasting vessels and coast batteries along the shores of France and Italy. By his captains and the commander-in-chief he was repeatedly recommended for his zeal, activity, and gallantry; but it was not till 15 June 1814 that he received the often-earned promotion to the rank of commander. He is said ‘to have been upwards of 100 times engaged with the enemy; to have been in command at the blowing up and destruction of eight batteries and three martello-towers; and to have taken part in the capture of about 60 vessels, 18 or 20 of them armed, and several cut out from under batteries.’\nThe Impérieuse was paid off in September 1814, and Travers was left unemployed till the summer of 1828, when he was appointed to command the Rose. From her he was advanced to post rank on 19 November 1829, mainly, it would seem, at the desire of the Duke of Clarence, who had been made acquainted with his long and peculiarly active war service, and who as William IV nominated him a K.H. on 4 February 1834, and knighted him on 5 March. Travers had no further employment afloat; he became a rear-admiral on the retired list on 9 July 1855, and died at Great Yarmouth on 4 March 1858. He married, in April 1815, Anne, eldest daughter of William Steward of Yarmouth, and left issue five sons and two daughters.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1886). \"Travers, Eaton Stannard\".

        "content": "The Cruise of the Kings (Greek: Η κρουαζιέρα των γαλαζοαίματων, romanized: I krouaziéra ton galazoématon) was a royal cruise around the Mediterranean Sea in the summer of 1954, organised by King Paul and Queen Frederica of Greece.\nThe cruise aimed to promote tourism in Greece and was drafted by Frederica. It occurred from 23 August to 3 September 1954 on the royal yacht Agamemnon. Royals from over 25 reigning and formerly reigning royal families were in attendance. A second cruise was scheduled for August 1956; however, the nationalisation of the Suez Canal and its closure by the British government, as well as growing violence in the Levant, prevented the cruise from playing out smoothly. The cruise was transformed into a shorter stay in Mon Repos, Corfu.\n\n\n== Conception ==\nThe cruise was drafted by Frederica of Hanover, the queen consort of Greece as the wife of Paul of Greece and a granddaughter of Kaiser Wilhelm II, to promote and \"open the doors\" to tourism in Greece, specifically in the Greek islands. The growth of tourism was hoped for as it would assist in economic recovery following World War II and the Greek Civil War. Another aim of the cruise was to rebuild ties between European royal families following World War I and World War II.According to Frederica's memoir, she was approached in 1954 by Eugenides, a Greek shipowner, who asked her to visit one of his transatlantic liners and give it her name. When this is done, the shipowner typically gives a brooch. However, Frederica requested that Eugenides instead assist her in organising a cruise for the royal families in Europe.The Greek Consul in Naples of the time, M. Tylpados also revealed to the French news outlet Combat that \"several engagements\" were hoped to be announced by the end of the cruise. Prince Michael of Greece and Denmark claimed in 2003 that \"some marriages or engagements\" amongst royals was one of the aims the cruise. The only marriage that was reached was that of Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia and Princess Maria Pia of Bourbon-Parma. However, Princess Sofía of Greece and Denmark and Prince Juan Carlos of Spain first met on the cruise and they would marry eight years later.\n\n\n== Events of the cruise ==\n\n\n=== 1954 edition ===\nEugenides' Agamemnon first departed on 23 August 1954 from a port in Marseille, a city of France, where Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg and her family boarded the yacht as the first royals to step foot on the cruise. At around 11:00 a.m., the Agamemnon stopped in Naples, where the majority of royal guests, including Paul, Frederica, and the Greek royal family, were picked up from. The Greek royals had arrived in Naples at around 8:20 am that same day, having taken the yacht Navarino from Greece. It took almost three hours for all the guests to board the ship in Naples. At around 1:45 pm, the Agamemnon departed Naples with its guests and sailed towards the Ionian islands.On board the yacht and at any locations it stopped at, it was agreed that royal protocol be abolished, which freed guests from any royal order of precedence to allow them to \"mingle more\" in a less formal environment, according to historian Julián Cortes Cavanillas. More informal standards, Frederica hoped it, would help rebuild familial ties between the guests.The cruise's first stop was on Corfu, where the final guests, Umberto II of Italy and his family, were picked up. The Italian royal family was banned from staying in Italy due to the 1946 Italian institutional referendum and the proclamation of the Italian Republic, so they were unable to be picked up from Naples. After they had boarded, the Agamemnon made numerous stops, including in Olympia, Heraklion, Rhodes, Santorini, Mykonos, Skiathos, Sounion and then Athens, via the port of Phalerum. On 31 August, the cruise's royal guests toured Epidaurus and viewed a performance of Euripides' Hippolytus.The following day, the Greek royal family departed the Agamemnon and returned to Tatoi Palace. Over the next two days, the yacht first stopped in Corfu, where the Italian royals departed, and then in Naples, where the rest of the guests left to return to their home countries. Prince Michael of Greece and Denmark described the cruise as \"great fun\" and a \"beautiful event\". The cruise was seen as successful and attracted a lot of media attention. Many shipping companies soon organised cruises that followed the same route as the Agamemnon. In her memoir, Frederica noted that the growth in cruises around Greece led to \"hotels and other land-based services and facilities\" growing in revenue and generating more tourist money for the country.\n\n\n=== 1956 edition ===\nFollowing the first edition of the cruise in 1954, which Frederica described as \"a great success\", she wished to reboot the event two years later. There were plans for the cruise to be on the yacht Achilles. However, a few days before the cruise was scheduled to begin, the Suez Crisis became apparent as the President of Egypt, Gamal Abdel Nasser, attempted to nationalise the canal, resulting in its closure by the British government. In addition, there was growing violence in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Levant. As a result, Frederica and Paul decided to alter the event from a cruise to a stay in Mon Repos, the royal residence in Corfu. The guest list thus had to be shortened significantly.\n\n\n== Dignitaries ==\nIn the 1954 cruise, 110 royal dignitaries of twenty nationalities were in attendance. Additionally, over fifteen different languages were spoken. Frederica recorded that despite language barriers, there \"was not the slightest difficulty during the ten days that the cruise lasted\".\n\n\n=== Greece ===\n The King and Queen of the Hellenes\n Princess Sofía of Greece and Denmark\n The Crown Prince of Greece\n Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark\n Prince and Princess George of Greece and Denmark\n Prince Michael of Greece and Denmark\n\n\n=== Foreign ===\n\n\n==== Austria ====\nMarie-Ileana of Habsburg-Tuscany\n\n\n==== Bulgaria ====\nSimeon II of Bulgaria\nPrincess Marie Louise of Bulgaria\n\n\n==== Denmark ====\n Prince Axel of Denmark\n Count and Countess Flemming of Rosenborg\n Prince Viggo, Count of Rosenborg, and Princess Viggo, Countss of Rosenborg\n\n\n==== France ====\nHenri, Count of Paris, and Isabelle, Countess of Paris\nPrincess Isabelle d'Orléans\nPrince Henri d'Orléans\nPrince François d'Orléans\nPrincess Anne d'Orléans\nPrincess Diane d'Orléans\nPrincess Hélène of Orléans\n\n\n==== Germany ====\n\n\n===== Baden =====\nPrincess Margarita of Baden\nPrince Ludwig of Baden\n\n\n===== Bavaria =====\nAlbrecht, Duke of Bavaria\nPrincess Marie Gabrielle of Bavaria\nFranz von Bayern\n\n\n===== Hanover =====\nErnest Augustus, Prince of Hanover, and Princess Ortrud of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg\nPrince George William of Hanover and Princess Sophie of Greece and Denmark\nPrince Christian Oscar of Hanover\nPrince Welf Henry of Hanover\n\n\n===== Hesse =====\nMoritz, Hereditary Landgrave of Hesse\nPrince Heinrich of Hesse-Kassel\nPrince Otto of Hesse-Kassel\nPrincess Dorothea of Hesse-Kassel\nPrince Rainer of Hesse-Kassel\n\n\n===== Hohenlohe =====\nGottfried, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, and Princess Margarita of Greece and Denmark\nKraft, Hereditary Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg\nPrincess Beatrix of Hohenlohe-Langenburg\nPrince George Andreas of Hohenlohe-Langenburg\n\n\n===== Mecklenburg =====\nDuke Christian Louis of Mecklenburg\nDuchess Thyra of Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n\n\n===== Schaumburg-Lippe =====\nPrince Christian of Schaumburg-Lippe and Princess Feodora of Denmark\n\n\n===== Schleswig-Holstein =====\nPeter, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein, and Princess Marie Alix of Schaumburg-Lippe\nPrince Frederick Ferdinand of Schleswig-Holstein, grandson of Friedrich, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg\n\n\n===== Thurn und Taxis and Radziwiłł families =====\nRaimundo, 2nd Duke of Castel Duino, and Princess Eugénie of Greece and Denmark\nTatiana Radziwiłł\n\n\n===== Törring-Jettenbach =====\nCarl Theodor, Count of Törring-Jettenbach\nHans Veit, Count of Törring-Jettenbach\nCountess Helene of Törring-Jettenbach\n\n\n===== Württemberg =====\nPhilipp Albrecht, Duke of Württemberg, and Archduchess Rosa of Austria\nDuke Ludwig of Württemberg\nDuchess Elisabeth of Württemberg\n\n\n==== Italy ====\n\n\n===== Bourbon-Parma =====\nPrince René of Bourbon-Parma and Princess Margaret of Denmark\nPrince Jacques of Bourbon-Parma\nPrince André of Bourbon-Parma\n\n\n===== Bourbon-Two Sicilies =====\nPrince Antoine of Bourbon-Two Sicilies\n\n\n===== Savoy =====\nUmberto II of Italy and Marie-José of Belgium\nPrincess Maria Pia of Savoy\nVittorio Emanuele, Prince of Naples\nPrincess Maria Gabriella of Savoy\nPrincess Maria Beatrice of Savoy\nPrincess Maria Cristina of Savoy-Aosta\n\n\n==== Luxembourg ====\n The Grand Duchess and Prince of Luxembourg\n The Hereditary Grand Duke and Hereditary Grand Duchess of Luxembourg\n Princess Elisabeth of Luxembourg\n\n\n==== Netherlands ====\n The Queen and Prince of the Netherlands\n Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands\n Princess Irene of the Netherlands\n\n\n==== Norway ====\n Princess Astrid of Norway\n\n\n==== Romania ====\nMichael I of Romania and Anne of Romania\n\n\n==== Russia ====\nPrince Dimitri Romanov\n\n\n==== Spain ====\nInfante Juan, Count of Barcelona, and Princess María de las Mercedes of Bourbon-Two Sicilies\nInfanta Pilar, Duchess of Badajoz\nInfante Juan Carlos of Spain\n\n\n==== Sweden ====\n Princess Margaretha of Sweden\n\n\n==== Yugoslavia ====\nPrince Alexander of Yugoslavia\nPrincess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nCortes Cavanillas, Julián (28 August 1954). \"The Court Greetings, the Only Protocol Detail of the \"Cruise of the Kings\"\".

In 1954, [shipowner] Eugenides asked me to visit one of his transatlantic liners and give it my name. When this type of request is made, it is customary to offer the godmother a large brilliant brooch. However, on this occasion I had an idea and asked Eugenides if, instead of this traditional gift, he would give me the necessary means to organize a cruise during which I would invite all the royal families of Europe […]. There were different reasons for organizing this cruise. First, Paul and I wanted to open the doors of Greece to tourism. […] But the first thing we needed was to get the world's attention. As the world press was responsible for giving wide publicity to the cruise, everything worked very well. Immediately afterwards, shipping companies began to organize cruises exactly following the program and itinerary of ours, and soon hotels and other land-based services and facilities began to bring tourist money to the country. Another reason was that, since World War I , royal families had not reunited internationally. […] The trip was a great success. We were 110 people, of twenty nationalities and speaking 15 different languages; despite this there was not the slightest difficulty during the ten days that the cruise lasted.

        "content": "Henry Vansittart (17 April 1777 – 21 March 1843) was a British Royal Navy vice admiral.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nVansittart was the fifth son of George Vansittart (1745–1825) of Bisham Abbey, Berkshire, who married, 24 October 1767, Sarah, daughter of the Rev. Sir James Stonhouse, bart., was born in George Street, Hanover Square, on 17 April 1777. George Henry Vansittart, was his elder brother. Henry Vansittart, the governor of Bengal, was his uncle, and Nicholas, first baron Bexley, his first cousin. Having been entered on the books of the Scipio, guardship in the Medway, in October 1788, he was afterwards nominally in the Boyne, guardship in the Thames, and probably actually served in the Pegasus on the Newfoundland station in 1791. In 1792 he was in the Hannibal, stationed at Plymouth, and in 1793 went out to the Mediterranean in the Princess Royal, flagship of Rear-admiral Samuel Goodall. During the siege of Toulon by the republican army he was severely wounded. After the evacuation of the place he was moved into L'Aigle, with Captain Samuel Hood, served at the siege of Calvi, and was in October 1794 moved into the Victory, in which he returned to England. On 21 February 1795 he was promoted to be lieutenant of the Stately, in which he was present at the capture of the Cape of Good Hope, and of the Dutch squadron in Saldanha Bay. He was then moved into the Monarch, Elphinstone's flagship, and returned in her to England. He was next appointed to the Queen Charlotte, Keith's flagship in the Channel; and on 30 May 1798 was promoted to be commander of the Hermes. From her he was moved to the Bonetta, which he took out to Jamaica; and on 13 February 1801 he was posted to the Abergavenny stationed at Port Royal. In July he returned to England in the Thunderer, and, after a few months on half-pay, was appointed, in April 1802 to the Magicienne, from which, in January 1803, he was moved to the Fortunée of 36 guns. For upwards of nine years he commanded this ship in the North Sea, off Boulogne, in the Channel, in the West Indies, and in the Mediterranean, for the most part in active cruising and in convoy service. In August 1812 he was moved into the 74-gun ship Clarence, till March 1814. With the exception of a few months in 1801–2 he had served continuously from 1791. He became a rear-admiral on 22 July 1830, vice-admiral on 23 November 1841, and died on 21 March 1843 at his seat, Eastwood, Woodstock, Canada. He married, in 1809, Mary Charity (d. 1834), daughter of the Rev. John Pennefather, and left issue.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1899). \"Vansittart, Henry (1777-1843)\".

        "content": "Robert Wilmot (died 1695) was a British Royal Navy commodore.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWilmot is first mentioned in July 1689 as second lieutenant of the 70-gun ship Exeter, then fitting out in the Medway. In the following March he was promoted to command the Cygnet fireship, in which he was present at the battle of Beachy Head on 30 June. On 19 August he was moved to the newly named fireship Hopewell, and shortly afterwards to the Dreadnought, to take that vessel round from Portsmouth to the river. The Dreadnought, an old 62-gun ship, built in 1654, was no longer seaworthy, and ‘foundered by her leakiness in her passage,’ off the South Foreland. By the court-martial held on 8 Dec. 1690 Wilmot was fully acquitted, and on 6 Jan. 1690–1 he was appointed to command the Crown of 48 guns for cruising service in the Channel. In 1692 he commanded the Wolf, hired ship, also of 48 guns, and convoyed the trade to Virginia and home. Early in 1693 he was appointed to the 70-gun ship Elizabeth, one of the grand fleet which, after accompanying Sir George Rooke past Ushant, returned to Torbay on 21 June, and remained there for a couple of months. During this time Wilmot quarrelled with Ensign Roydon of Ingoldsby's regiment, a detachment of which was serving on board the Elizabeth as marines. The quarrel resulted in a duel fought on shore, and Roydon was killed. Wilmot was charged with manslaughter, arrested by the marshal of the admiralty, tried at the assizes in Devonshire in the following March, and acquitted. On 25 April 1694 he was reappointed to the Elizabeth (Edye, History of the Royal Marines, i. 387; Admiralty Minute Books, 30 Aug., 4 Sept. 1693, 5 March 1693–4).\nIn the following October he was appointed to the 60-gun ship Dunkirk, and the command of an expedition sent to the West Indies, where it was to co-operate with the Spaniards against the French settlements in Hispaniola. The squadron appointed for this service, consisting, besides the Dunkirk, of three 50-gun ships and some smaller vessels, together with transports carrying twelve hundred soldiers commanded by Colonel Luke Lillingston, sailed from Plymouth on 22 January 1695. In March it was at St. Christopher's, and after some correspondence with the Spanish governor of St. Domingo it sailed for Savana on the 28th. At Savana, however, it was found that, contrary to the hopes the governor had held out, the Spaniards were not ready, and it was the end of April before Cape Français could be attacked. This the French evacuated after setting on fire, and it was some weeks before the different elements of the assailing force could agree on what was next to be done and how it was to be done. At length they attacked and on 3 July took Port de la Paix, out of which they collected a booty estimated as worth about 200,000l. This seems to have been the cause of the bitter quarrel which broke out between Wilmot and Lillingston, though the particulars are unknown. Wilmot was anxious, late as the season was, to go on and capture Petit Goave and Leogane; but the sickly state of the troops, and probably also Lillingston's ill will, rendered this impossible, and leaving the 50-gun ships behind for the protection of Jamaica, Wilmot sailed for England on 3 September But the fever, which had killed so many of the soldiers, had now spread to the ships, and very many of the seamen died, Wilmot himself among the first, on 15 September Lillingston afterwards published a pamphlet accusing Wilmot of several irregularities, none of which, however, he could substantiate by any evidence except his own assertion; and Wilmot was dead. In the account of the expedition published by Burchett, who, as secretary of the admiralty, was in a better position for learning the truth than any other man could possibly be, the accusations of Lillingston are passed over with contempt.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1900). \"Wilmot, Robert (d.1695)\".

        "content": "Carl Mayotte (born in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada) is a Québécois bass guitarist, composer, arranger and  conductor.  In 2018, he formed the jazz fusion group the Carl Mayotte Quintet, with whom he has released four studio albums.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Career ===\nHe began his musical career at the age of 16, playing in many bars and events around Quebec. He completed a technical degree at Campus Notre-Dame-de-Foy before completing his bachelor's degree in jazz interpretation at Laval University, followed by a Master's degree with the jazz faculty of McGill University. During the years, he traveled across Quebec, and many times to France, with the goal of democratizing jazz and bringing this musical genre to the forefront.\n\n\n=== Influences ===\nHe did not limit himself solely to jazz music. As he stated in an interview with Radio-Canada: \"I try to listen to as many styles as possible, and above all, I do not want to put up barriers for myself\". He listens to pop music, has said that he enjoys the New Zealand singer Kimbra, and when he was younger listened to rock and progressive metal groups, such as Tool, Primus and Dream Theater. In going from classical music to the more modern jazz fusion, he is able to appreciate and be inspired by many different styles of music.\n\n\n=== Carl Mayotte Quintet ===\nWith his group Carl Mayotte Quintet, formed from five musicians, Gabriel Cyrl (electric guitar), Francis Grégoire (keyboard), Damien-Jade Cyr (saxophone) and Stéphane Chamberland (drums), he has had the chance to participate in many concerts, events, festivals as well as doing master classes in CEGEPs, conservatories and universities across the province of Quebec.\n\n\n=== Music camp ===\nIn the summer of 2022, Mayotte created a new jazz music camp in St-Alexandre de Kamouraska, bringing together musicians of all ages and levels.\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\nMayotte won the Radio-Canada révélation in jazz for 2020-21 for his album Fantosme (2019). He made his first album with the group Carl Mayotte Quintet and has worked with Michel Cusson.\nHe has also been nominated during Le Premier Gala de l'ADISQ in the category Jazz Album of the Year. His third album, Escale (2022) earned him a Félix prize at the ADISQ Gala for Album of the Year in 2022.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Carl Mayotte Quintet ===\n2019 : Fantosme\n2021 : Pop de Ville, Vol.1\n2022 : Escale\n2023 : Carnaval\n\n\n=== Nouvelle R ===\n2015 : L’emporte-pièce\n2017 : Sendionek Mastro\n2018 : Sénescence\n\n\n=== De Si Belles ===\n2018 : De Si Belles\n\n\n=== Other projects ===\n2016 : Marie-Claire Quartet : 60/40\n2022 : Carl Mayotte: In a Sentimental Mood\n\n\n=== Appearances on other albums ===\n2020 : Félix Connolly : Entre Deux\n2021 : François Doyon : Noël\n\n\n== Videography ==\n\n\n=== Clips (Carl Mayotte Quintet) ===\n2019 : Marise\n2023 : Le Saltimbanque\n\n\n=== Clips (Triton Trio) ===\n2013 : Triton Trio - medley de musique de film\n2016 : Triton Trio - Concerto Rock\n2018 : Triton Trio - Demo 2018\n2020 : Super Mario Bros Medley - Triton Trio\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

Comme il a déjà mentionné dans un questionnaire à Radio-Canada : «Je tente d’écouter le plus de styles possible, et je ne veux surtout pas me mettre de barrières.» . Il écoute de la musique pop, il a d’ailleurs mentionné la chanteuse néo-zélandaise Kimbra, et plus jeune il écoutait également des groupes de rock et de métal progressif, tels que Tool, Primus et Dream Theater. En allant de la musique classique au jazz fusion plus moderne, il est capable d’apprécier et de s’inspirer de beaucoup de styles de musiques différents.\n\n\n=== Carl Mayotte Quintet ===\nAvec son groupe Carl Mayotte Quintet, formé de 5 musiciens de formation, tel que Gabriel Cyr (guitare électrique), Francis Grégoire (claviers), Damien-Jade Cyr (saxophone) et Stéphane Chamberland (batterie), il a eu la chance de participer à plusieurs concerts, évènements, festivals et aussi faire des classes de maître des cégeps, des conservatoires et des universités à travers la province de Québec.\n\n\n=== Camp Musical ===\nÀ l’été 2022, Carl Mayotte crée un nouveau camp musical jazz à St-Alexandre de Kamouraska, réunissant des musiciens de tous les âges et de tous les niveaux. «L’un des buts du jeune musicien est de démocratiser le jazz et de ramener ce genre musical à l’avant-plan.».\n\n\n== Lauréat et nomination ==\nCarl Mayotte a remporté la révélation Radio-Canada en jazz de 2020-21 grâce à son album Fantosme (2019). Il s’agit de son premier album avec son groupe Carl Mayotte Quintet et il a été coréalisé avec Michel Cusson.\nIl a aussi été nominé lors du premier Gala de l’ADISC 2020 dans la catégorie Album Jazz de l’année. Son troisième album, Escale (2022), lui a valu un prix Félix au Gala de l'ADISQ pour l’album de l’année en 2022.\n\n\n== Discographie ==\n\n\n=== Carl Mayotte Quintet ===\n2019 : Fantosme\n2021 : Pop de Ville, Vol.1\n2022 : Escale\n2023 : Carnaval\n\n\n=== Nouvelle R ===\n2015 : L’emporte-pièce\n2017 : Sendionek Mastro\n2018 : Sénescence\n\n\n=== De Si Belles ===\n2018 : De Si Belles\n\n\n=== Autres Projets ===\n2016 : Marie-Claire Quartet : 60/40\n2022 : Carl Mayotte: In a Sentimental Mood\n\n\n=== Apparition sur d’autres albums ===\n2020 : Félix Connolly : Entre Deux\n2021 : François Doyon : Noël\n\n\n== Vidéographie ==\n\n\n=== Clips (Carl Mayotte Quintet) ===\n2019 : Marise\n2023 : Le Saltimbanque\n\n\n=== Clips (Triton Trio) ===\n2013 : Triton Trio - medley de musique de film\n2016 : Triton Trio - Concerto Rock\n2018 : Triton Trio - Demo 2018\n2020 : Super Mario Bros Medley - Triton Trio\n\n\n== Notes et références ==\n\n\n=== Liens externes ===\nSite officiel\nCarl Mayotte sur Facebook\nCarl Mayotte sur Instagram\n\n\n== Voir aussi ==",

The church was commissioned in 1777 by the local parish priest don Francesco Marchini, and designed by Antonio Foschini. Work took seven years. The tall brick facade is notable for its convex layout with four empty niches. On the roofline are statues of two female saints. The interior has an oval layout with a rounded apse. At the entrance are two marble statues depicting Saints Peter and Paul. The main altarpiece at one time consisted of a triptych of Dosso Dossi depicting St George and the Dragon. A 19th century copy is present in the sacristy. The interior was restored in the 1950s.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hugh Colvill Goldsmith (2 April 1789 – 8 October 1841) was a British Royal Navy lieutenant.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGoldsmith son of Henry, son of the eldest brother of Oliver Goldsmith the author. A brother, Charles Goldsmith, was a commander in the navy (1795–1854). Hugh was born at St. Andrews, New Brunswick, on 2 April 1789, and having served his time as a midshipman in the navy was promoted to the rank of lieutenant on 27 January 1809. After the peace he seems to have been employed chiefly in the preventive service, and in 1824 commanded the Nimble revenue cutter on the coast of Cornwall. On 8 April, landing near the headland called Trereen Castle in search of some smuggled goods, he went up to look at the Logan Rock, a rocking stone which weighs about eighty tons; and being told that ‘it was not in the power of man to remove it,’ he took it into his head to try. Accordingly, when his boat had finished dragging for the suspected goods, he called his men up and tried to move the stone with three handspikes. These were of no avail; they were therefore laid aside, and the nine men, taking hold of the rock by the edge, without great difficulty set it in a rocking motion, which became so great that to try to stop it seemed dangerous, lest it should fall back on the men. So it presently rocked itself off its pivot, falling away about thirty-nine inches, and lying inclined on the adjacent rocks. According to Goldsmith's positive statement, in a letter to his mother written a few days afterwards (Household Words, 1852, vi. 234), he had no intention or thought of doing mischief. He did not know of the value placed on the rock by the neighbourhood, and was thunderstruck when he found the uproar that his deed occasioned. As soon, however, as he realised the way in which his exploit was regarded, he determined to do what he could to replace the stone. The admiralty lent him tackles, sheers, capstans, and men. The work began on 29 October, and on Tuesday, 2 Nov., the stone was again in its place, rocking as before, though whether better or worse is disputed. Lithographed views of the process of replacing the stone were published at Penzance in 1824. Many common statements about the matter are authoritatively denied. Goldsmith was never promoted, and as lieutenant commanding the Megæra died at sea off St. Thomas in the West Indies on 8 October 1841.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1890). \"Goldsmith, Hugh Colvill\".

        "content": "David Saunders (born 1936) is an English artist, teacher, and musician. His work is systematic and constructivist. It is mainly exhibited and appreciated in Europe, where it is held in many national collections.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nSaunders was born in 1936 in Southend-on-Sea, Essex. After leaving school, he worked briefly in the advertising industry while taking evening classes held by Vivian Pitchforth at St Martin's School of Art.\nSaunders was conscripted into the army and stationed on Salisbury plain, where he enjoyed painting while not on active service. After being discharged, he studied at the Royal Academy Schools under Frederick Gore from 1959 to 1962, where he gained a master's degree.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter completing his studies, Saunders was appointed to a teaching post at Newport College of Art in 1965, where he first met the painter Jeffrey Steele. In 1967 Saunders started producing \"Systematic-Constructive\" work.\nIn 1968, at the Arts Council of Great Britain Thirtienth Open Exhibition for Painting and Sculpture in Cardiff, Saunders and Steele won the Purchase Prize. This event began a long collaboration between both artists and, one year later, the establishment of the Systems Group, following the 1969 exhibition in Helsinki.\nIn 1970, Saunders became artist-in-residence at Sussex University and in 1972 at Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, where he studied the works of Piet Mondrian. Between 1970 and 1980 Saunders was a visiting lecturer at the Slade School of Fine Art, London University, which he combined with teaching painting and photography at Liverpool Polytechnic Art School \nIn the late 1970s he started looking into colour functions, and in 1985, while living in Clwyd, Wales, he organised a touring exhibition called Colour Presentations. He was a member of the 56 Group in Wales.\nIn 1988, aged 52, Saunders stepped away from formal teaching.\nArt historian Alan Fowler discusses Saunders' work in his 2006 PhD thesis \"Constructive Art in Britain 1913 - 2005\". Saunders is also mentioned in Alastair Grieve's 2005 book \"Constructed Abstract Art in England After the Second World War: A Neglected Avant-Garde\".\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1985 Saunders lived in Clwyd, North Wales, returning to London in 1994. In 2006, Saunders moved to Tarascon-sur-Ariège, France, where he is currently resident.\n\n\n== Music ==\nSaunders became associated with the Portsmouth Sinfonia and the Ross and Cromarty Orchestra \n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nListed is a selection of Saunders' exhibitions:\n\n\n=== Solo ===\n1965: First solo exhibition at the Artists' International Association gallery, London\n1970: Gardner Centre Gallery, University of Sussex, Brighton\n1995: Janus Avivson Gallery, London \n2002: SEVEN SEVEN gallery, London \n2002: Dean Clough Gallery, Halifax,\n2016: La Galerie, Lycée Gabriel Fauré, Foix \n2018: Transforming Surfaces, Arthouse1 Gallery, London \n\n\n=== Group ===\n1967: Survey 67, Camden Arts Centre, London\n1968: Wales Now, Welsh Arts Council,\n1969: Systeemi•System, Amos Anderson Museum, Helsinki\n1971: Matrix, Arnolfini Gallery, Bristol\n1972: Systems, a touring exhibition organised by the Arts Council and Whitechapel Art Gallery\n1983: Four British Constructivists, Engstrom Gallery, Stockholm\n1986: Colour Presentations, Gardner Centre Gallery, University of Sussex/Stoke-on-Trent City Museum/Spacex Gallery, Exeter \n1986: Colour Constructions, Exhibiting Space, London \n1986: Systematic and Constructivist Drawings, Wentworth Gallery, University of York \n1994: Mostyn Open Exhibition 5, Oriel Mostyn, Mostyn, Wales\n2008: A Rational Aesthetic Southampton City Art Gallery, UK,\n2017: Systems 1972, Tate Britain\n\n\n== Works in Public Collections ==\nTate Gallery, London\nSouthampton City Art Gallery\nThe South Bank Collection, London\nArts Council of Wales\nNational Museum of Wales, Cardiff\nNational Library of Wales\nConoco-Philips Collection, Warwick\nDean Clough Collection, Halifax\nSammlung Konkrete Kunst, Jena\nGemeente Museum, The Hague\nRijksmuseum Meermano, The Hague\nStanford University, USA\nUniversity of Sussex\nVictoria and Albert Museum, London\nArts Council of England\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website David Saunders",

        "content": "The VIII World Esperanto Congress in 1912 was organized on the 25th anniversary of the publication of the first textbook for learning Esperanto. It took place in Kraków from August 11 to 18, 1912. Ludwik Zamenhof, who participated in it, declared during the opening that he was resigning from the leadership of the movement and would attend the next congress as an ordinary Esperantist. The congress was attended by Esperantists from Europe, Asia, and America. The proceedings took place within 28 sections and plenary meetings. As part of the congress, accompanying events were organized, such as performances, lectures, excursions (to Wieliczka and Zakopane), and competitions. An exhibition of Esperanto publications was prepared in the building of the Academy of Commerce, and the opening and closing of the congress, plenary sessions, and a ball took place in the halls of the Helena Modrzejewska National Old Theatre, during which participants presented themselves in national costumes.\n\n\n== Preparations ==\nPreparations for the congress began in early 1912. The Kraków City Council allocated a subsidy of 3000 crowns for the organization and allowed the use of the Old Theatre hall. An Illustrated Guide to Kraków in Esperanto was published. On August 8, the fire brigade began decorating the city. In front of the Academy of Commerce and the industrial exhibition, masts were erected to display flags and banners, with green garlands hung between them. The Josephite Workshop was responsible for their preparation and for decorating the interiors of the academy and the Old Theatre.\n\n\n== Organization ==\nThe organization was led by a committee chaired by Odo Bujwid, with its headquarters at 19 Radziwiłłowska Street. The congress proceedings took place in the Old Theatre hall, while the press facilities, press office, section meetings, and exhibition were located at the Academy of Commerce on Kapucyńska Street. Meetings of 28 sections were planned (including those for doctors, postcard collectors, teachers, Catholics, etc.). Working and plenary sessions (four in total) of the Universal Esperanto Association (Esperanto: Universala Esperanto-Asocio) were to be held in the Old Theatre hall. The press office of the congress was managed by editor Jerzy Grzywiński. Bank Krajowy opened a currency exchange office on the ground floor, where participants could exchange money. Congress attendees were entitled to free tram transportation upon showing their congress card.\nThe congress newspaper, Kongresa Bulteno, was published daily as a supplement to the Ilustrowany Kuryer Codzienny. The first issue featured a portrait of Zamenhof, information about Poland and Kraków, a telegram section for messages related to the congress, and an information section. Additionally, the Kraków-based Goniec Poniedziałkowy published a supplement dedicated to the congress, titled Lunda Kuriero.\n\n\n=== Participation card and badges ===\n\nThe cost of participation in the congress was set at 14.40 crowns. As proof of payment, participants received a congress card and congress badges. These were bronze plaques, one-sided, designed by sculptor Henryk Kunzek. They were hung on ribbons: Kraków Esperantists on white-blue, Polish Esperantists on white-amaranth, and others on green. They had a quadrangular shape with a loop, on which a \"naked woman sitting on a winged globe; hands raised above the head reaching for a five-pointed star\" was depicted. The inscription VIII UNIWERS KONGRESO ESPERANTISTA = XXV JARA JUBILEO KRAKOW 1912 was placed on the sides.

At the railway station, he was welcomed by the Congress Committee, led by Odo Bujwid. Accompanying him were the congress attendees: Carlo Bourlet, Gabriel Chavet, Frenckell, and S. Winkelman from Dresden. On Saturday evening, a cabaret performance in Esperanto took place at the Teatr Nowości. It consisted of a one-act play, a cabaret performance by theater actors, and a performance by an amateur Esperantist from Kraków, Kriss, with a monologue of a Chinese character. On the day of the congress opening, August 11, at 1:00 PM, the city authorities invited attendees to a lavish breakfast at the restaurant of the Old Theater. About a thousand people, including Ludwik Zamenhof and delegates representing 33 nations of the congress members, participated in it.\n\n\n=== Beginning of the congress ===\nBefore the congress proceedings began, participants from different countries met to choose a representative who would speak on their behalf at the ceremonial opening of the congress. Poles from the three partitions were entitled to choose three individuals, but at the suggestion of Dr. Skałkowski from Warsaw, it was decided to select one representative. The choice was to emphasize the unity of Poles from the three partitions. Antoni Grabowski was chosen.\nIn the afternoon of August 11th, at 3:00 PM, the delegates gathered in the hall of the Old Theater for the solemn inauguration of the proceedings. The hall was decorated with flags and the city's coat of arms. Seated at the presidium table alongside Ludwik Zamenhof were Odo Bujwid, Carlo Bourlet, Antoni Grabowski, Kraków's vice mayors Henryk Szarski and Józef Sare, starosta Władysław Kowalikowski, Father Giesswein, and city councilors. Carlo Bourlet opened the proceedings and proposed the election of the congress authorities. Szczepan Mikołajski was elected chairman, with H. Bolingbroke Mudie from England, Engineer Rollet de L'Isle from France, Arnold Behrendt from Germany, A. Niedoszywin from Russia, and A. Grabowski from Poland as vice presidents. Secretaries were appointed: Chavet from France and Dr. Leon Rosenstock serving as congress secretary.\nPresident Szarski welcomed the guests, reading a pre-prepared text in Esperanto. He thanked for choosing Kraków as the meeting place for Esperantists. Jan Kanty Federowicz spoke on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce, followed by the chairman of the organizing committee Odo Bujwid, who spoke about the relationship between Esperanto and patriotism. Finally, Ludwik Zamenhof took the floor. He mentioned deceased Esperantists and announced that he believed his work had already matured. Therefore, during his speech, he declared that for the last time he stands before the congress as a leader and director of the movement, and if he comes to future congresses, his place will not be on the stage, but among the rank and file. Secretary Chavet read greetings and telegrams from around the world. Representatives of governments then spoke, followed by representatives of the national groups gathered at the congress: Americans, Ukrainians, Croats, Belgians, Bulgarians, English, Scots, Irish, Welsh, Danes, Finns, French, Germans, Italians, Poles, Japanese, Mexicans, Norwegians, Serbs, and Swedes. In the name of the Spaniards, four delegates spoke because separate speeches were addressed to the congress by representatives of Catalans, Basques, and Castilians. The final item on the agenda was a resolution to send telegrams to Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria (Kraków was part of Austria-Hungary) and Queen Elisabeth of Wied. In the evening, a reception was held in honor of Zamenhof in the hall of the Rifle Society.\n\n\n=== Jubilee evening ===\nOn August 12th, a concert was scheduled to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Esperanto movement and in honor of Ludwik Zamenhof. The concert featured performances by Ada Sari, actors Stanisława Wysocka and Wiktor Biegański, a men's choir composed of members of the former Musical Society, and Lutnia. Wiktor Barabasz conducted the event. Additionally, the orchestra of the 100th Infantry Regiment, led by conductor Sitter, performed.\n\n\n=== August 15th ===\nOn August 15th, participants of the congress took part in religious services: Catholics at St. Mary's Basilica, where the service was conducted by Canon Giesswein and the sermon delivered by Father Szurek. Protestants prayed in the Protestant church, where the sermon was given by Pastor Michejda. Jews prayed at the synagogue on Miodowa Street, where the sermon was delivered by Rabbi Saphra from Annaberg-Buchholz. After laying wreaths at the monuments of Adam Mickiewicz and Nicolaus Copernicus, participants went to the architectural exhibition area, where photos were taken, and awards were given in literary competitions. In the evening, a ball took place. It began with Odo Bujwid leading the polonaise with Mrs. Zamenhof. The festivities lasted until 4:00 AM.\n\n\n=== Congress proceedings and conclusion ===\nDuring the plenary session on August 16th, a decision was made regarding the locations for the next congresses. The next one in 1913 was to be held in Genoa, and the following year in Paris. Delegates from various countries extended invitations to host future congresses. Thanks were conveyed to the Ministry of Education in China for establishing an Esperanto school in Beijing and for promoting the language in China. In the evening, participants could listen to Halka in Esperanto.\nThe closing ceremonies of the congress began with a tribute to the late Johann Martin Schleyer, the creator of the Volapük language. Speakers highlighted the good organization, and Glück from Vienna presented an album with the signatures of all the attendees to the congress. After expressions of gratitude from the organizers, La Espero anthem was sung, and with chants of \"See you in Genoa\", the proceedings were closed. After the congress ended, a delegation including President Mikołajski, Zamenhof, Bourlet, and Bujwid visited Vice Mayor Szarski to thank the city council of Kraków for the warm reception of the congress members. In Pola Esperantisto, Leo Belmont summarized the congress and its organization by writing, Kraków set an example in organizing the congress.\n\n\n== Ball ==\nTraditionally, during the congress, its participants gather at a ball. They wear national costumes that showcase the culture of each nation represented at the congress. 90 people could watch the ball from the gallery after purchasing special tickets priced from 11 to 6 crowns.\n\n\n== Tribute to Mickiewicz, Copernicus and Kościuszko ==\n\nOn August 15th at 12 o'clock, all Esperantists gathered at the Adam Mickiewicz monument. A wreath with green ribbons was laid, bearing the inscription: A la granda homarano – VIII Kongreso Esperantista, which in Szczepan Mikołajski's translation can be rendered as: Homage is paid to the great man, belonging to all humanity, the VIII Esperanto Congress. After laying the wreath, Holder from Geneva explained in his speech that thanks to translations into Esperanto, those who know this language can appreciate not only Mickiewicz but also other Polish writers such as Juliusz Słowacki, Eliza Orzeszkowa, Maria Konopnicka, or Bolesław Prus, even though their works are often not translated into the national languages of the participants.\nIn the afternoon, a wreath was laid at the then-standing Nicolaus Copernicus Monument in the courtyard of Collegium Maius. The speech was delivered by Professor Carlo Bourlet from Paris.\nOn August 17th in the afternoon, Americans who arrived at the congress laid a wreath and a flag at the Tadeusz Kościuszko plaque on the Main Square.\n\n\n== Exhibition ==\n\nThe collections presented at the exhibition came from two sources. Part of them was received from publishers by the organizers, and the other part was purchased by the organizing committee from the Warsaw antiquarian and librarian, Aleksander Brzostowski. It included the first Esperanto textbooks from 1887 in Polish, Russian, German, French, and English, catalogs, propaganda brochures, and more. Brzostowski's collection was supplemented in 1910 when he organized an exhibition of Esperanto publications in Warsaw and received many publications from publishers.\nThe exhibition was opened on August 9th on the third floor of the building. All the collections were placed in 5 rooms, dividing the gathered materials into four sections: propaganda publications, historical materials, literature, and business publications. The fifth room housed a bookstore. Almost all the books available there were sold. The aim of the exhibition was to show the development of the Esperanto language over the course of 25 years of its existence. The cost of admission for non-participants of the congress was 20 hellers. Over the course of several days, it was visited by around 1,700 people (in addition to the participants). The collections gathered there remained in Kraków and were intended to become the nucleus of a museum.\n\n\n== Photographs ==\n\nA group photograph of all the participants of the congress was taken on August 12th under the Kościuszko Mound. Ludwik Zamenhof sits in the center, surrounded by members of his family and other Esperantists: his wife Klara, daughter Zofia Zamenhof, brother Leon Zamenhof, as well as non-family members including the publicist and poet Leo Belmont and Leon Rosenstock, who served as the secretary during the congress. The photograph was taken by two photographers: Edward Pierzchalski from Kraków and Władysław Gargul from Bochnia. Information about the photograph can be found on the website of the Historical Museum of Kraków.\nThey were not the only photographers at the congress; the Scottish Esperantist John Mabon Warden also took photographs. In 2019, the Zamenhof Center in Białystok, through the Polish Cultural Institute in London, received glass negatives taken during the congress from Billy Chapman.\n\n\n== Accompanying events ==\n\n\n=== Excursion to Wieliczka ===\nOn August 13th, participants embarked on an excursion to Wieliczka, traveling in two trains. They were welcomed at the station by Mayor Franciszek Aywas. The purpose of the trip was to visit the salt mine. A total of 1,200 people participated in the excursion.\n\n\n=== Lecture on garden cities ===\nOn August 14th, within the premises of the architectural exhibition opened in Kraków in 1912, adjacent to the Jordan Park, English architect Ebenezer Howard delivered a lecture in Esperanto titled On the Development of Garden Cities. The lecture was translated into Polish.\n\n\n=== Performances ===\nIn the evening of August 14th, the play Mazepa translated into Esperanto by Antoni Grabowski was staged at the theater. The performers included Józef Węgrzyn and Stanisława Wysocka.\nOn August 16th, the premiere of Stanisław Moniuszko's Halka in Esperanto was performed by the Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet. The libretto was translated by Włodzimierz Wolski, and the orchestra was conducted by Bronisław Wolfsthal. The main roles were played by Józef Munclinger (as the Stolnik), Stefania Marynowiczówna (as Zofia), Leonia Ogrodzka (as Halka), and Adam Okoński (as Janusz).\n\n\n=== Competitions ===\nLiterary competitions were announced before the congress. The award ceremony took place on August 15th at the architectural exhibition. The winners were: for fiction – Adela Schafer from London and Kurt Sommer, for poetry – Vasilij Devjatnin from Paris, for scientific works – Maurice Fréchet and Hugo Dreusicke.\n\n\n== Excursion to Zakopane ==\n\nThe day after the congress ended, around 100 participants, mainly from England and France, traveled by train on an excursion to Zakopane. The following day, three Esperantists set out on foot to Zakopane, among them Michel Rifaat Romano from Turkey, who had previously arrived in Kraków from Paris with Vasilij Devjatnin.\nThe participants of the excursion, including Zamenhof and Bujwid, traveled by carriage to the Strążyska Valley after lunch. In the evening, they attended a reception hosted by the marshal of Nowy Targ County, Dr. Andrzej Chramiec. On Monday morning, the guests went to the Kościeliska Valley and then visited Dr. Kazimierz Dłuski's sanatorium. After lunch at the Morskie Oko hotel, they visited the Tatra Museum, Kuźnice, and the Jaworzynka Valley.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Cuatro de Marzo is a neighborhood in the city of Valladolid, Spain, located between Paseo de Zorrilla and the Pisuerga River and inaugurated on October 29, 1959, by the then Head of the Spanish State, Francisco Franco.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe residential complex of 1,947 apartments, whose construction began in 1954, was planned to alleviate the housing shortage during the Spanish postwar period. It is configured with linear blocks of different heights in red brick, closed at its ends with five 11-story towers. The apartments come in two types, 80 and 120 square meters. Likewise, the neighborhood is divided in two by a green area in front of the facade of the Church of Santo Domingo de Guzmán, of modern style. It also has a school group and up to 23 commercial premises.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name of the neighborhood refers to the event that took place on March 4, 1934, in the Calderón Theater, when the Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista (JONS) of Onésimo Redondo and Ramiro Ledesma merged with the Falange Española of José Antonio Primo de Rivera resulting in Falange Española de las JONS. In the center of the neighborhood, there is a monolith in honor of Jesús Aramburu, civil governor of Valladolid and promoter of the urban work.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNOT N 879 A NO-DO with Franco's visit to Valladolid in 1949",
